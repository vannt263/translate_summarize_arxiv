    "it is a non - trivial task to find the global minimum for higgs potentials with a large number of higgs fields .",
    "for instance in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( nmssm )  @xcite , the higgs sector consists of two ( complex ) electroweak doublets and one ( complex ) electroweak singlet , that is 8 real fields from the doublets plus 2 real fields from the singlet .",
    "the conventional approach based on the unitary gauge requires the global minimum to be found in a 7-dimensional field space .    in this paper",
    "we introduce an algebraic approach to determine the global minimum of the higgs potential .",
    "we describe how to compute all stationary points , from which then the one with the lowest value of the potential can be identified as the global minimum .",
    "we apply the method to the nmssm , where we can reveal a quite surprising structure of stationary points , that is minima , maxima , and saddle points with different behaviour with respect to the symmetry breaking of the  electroweak gauge group .",
    "the global minimum of the higgs potential gives the expectation values of the higgs fields at the stable vacuum .",
    "parameter values for the higgs potential are thus considered acceptable only , if the global minimum of the higgs potential occurs for higgs field vacuum expectation values , which induce the spontaneous breakdown of to the electromagnetic at the observed electroweak scale @xmath0  gev .",
    "we consider the tree level higgs potential for general models with two higgs doublets and an arbitrary number of additional higgs singlets .",
    "the first step is to notice that the potential is restricted by renormalisability and gauge invariance .",
    "renormalisability requires at most quartic terms in the real fields in the potential .",
    "electroweak gauge invariance restricts the possible doublet terms in the potential , since only gauge invariant scalar products of doublets can occur .",
    "substituting the doublet fields by appropriate functions of these invariant terms , we eliminate all gauge degrees of freedom from the potential and effectively reduce the occurring powers in the doublet terms . the method to base the analysis on quadratic gauge invariant functions",
    "was introduced already in context with the general two - higgs doublet model  @xcite .",
    "if the potential is bounded from below , the global minima are given by the stationary points with the lowest value of the potential .",
    "the stationarity conditions form a non - linear , multivariate , inhomogeneous polynomial system of equations of third order . in this work",
    "we want to introduce a systematic approach to solve these  in general quite involved  systems of polynomial equations . since we eliminate the gauge degrees of freedom by means of gauge invariant functions the number of complex solutions is assumed to be finite , which implies the absence of further continuous symmetries .",
    "we propose to determine the stationary points by a groebner basis computation , which is well established in ideal theory  @xcite .",
    "the groebner basis was originally introduced to solve the _ ideal membership problem_. constructing this groebner basis in an appropriate order of the _ monomials _ ( the terms of the polynomials including coefficients ) , for instance the _ lexicographical ordering _ , and subsequent triangularisation allows to solve the initial system of equations .",
    "the method guarantees that all stationary points are found .",
    "we apply the method introduced to the nmssm . for the computation of groebner bases as well as the subsequent steps to solve the systems of equations we employ the freely available open - source algebra program .",
    "we find that large parts of the parameter space of the nmssm higgs potential can be excluded by requiring the global minimum to lead to the electroweak symmetry breaking observed in nature .",
    "we illustrate this by determining the allowed and forbidden ranges for some generic parameter values for this model .    in the literature we found many conditions which constrain parts of the parameter space in the nmssm ,",
    "see for instance  @xcite .",
    "typically the conditions used are necessary but it is not clear if they are also sufficient to ensure that the resulting theory is acceptable .",
    "we also want to mention that there is a purely numerical approach to determine the global minimum in the effective one - loop nmssm higgs potential  @xcite .",
    "the aim of our present work is to systematically reveal all stationary points of the tree level potential by solving the system of equations which originates from the stationarity condition .",
    "we show , that this can be done for the full parameter space including violation . with our method",
    "we can decide unequivocally if a given parameter set of the tree level higgs potential leads to an acceptable theory or not .",
    "we consider the tree - level higgs potential of models having ( weak isospin and hypercharge ) electroweak gauge symmetry .",
    "in particular we study models with two higgs doublets and @xmath1 additional real higgs isospin and hypercharge singlets .",
    "this includes in particular thdms , where we have no additional higgs singlets , and the nmssm with one additional complex higgs singlet corresponding to two real singlets .",
    "we assume both doublets to carry hypercharge @xmath2 and denote the complex doublet fields by @xmath3 for the singlets we assume real fields which we denote by @xmath4    we remark that in supersymmetric models like the nmssm the two higgs doublets @xmath5 , @xmath6 carry hypercharges and respectively .",
    "this can be translated to the convention used here by setting @xmath7 where @xmath8 complex singlet fields are embedded in our notation by treating the real and imaginary parts of the complex singlets as two real singlet degrees of freedom .      in the most general gauge invariant",
    "higgs potential with the field content described above , the doublet degrees of freedom enter solely via products of the following form : @xmath9 it is convenient to discuss the properties of the potential such as its stability and its stationary points in terms of these gauge invariant quadratic expressions .",
    "this was discussed in detail for thdms and also extended for the case of more than two doublets in  @xcite .",
    "we recall the main steps here .",
    "we arrange all possible invariant scalar products into the hermitian @xmath10  matrix @xmath11 and consider its decomposition @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the four real coefficients in this decomposition are @xmath14 where here and in the following summation over repeated indices is understood .",
    "the matrix  ( [ eq - kmat ] ) is positive semi - definite , which implies @xmath15 on the other hand , for every hermitian @xmath10  matrix @xmath16 satisfying   there exist fields   satisfying  , see  @xcite .",
    "it was also shown in  @xcite that the four quantities @xmath17 satisfying   parametrise the gauge orbits of the higgs doublets . using the inversion of  ( [ eq - kdef ] ) , @xmath18 we can replace the doublet terms of the potential ",
    "due to renormalisability  by at most quadratic terms in the real functions @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , which simplifies the potential and eliminates all  gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "we thus end up with a potential of the form .      to determine the stationary points of the higgs potential we consider and take the constraint into account .",
    "we distinguish the possible cases of stationary points by the symmetry breaking behaviour which a vacuum of this type would have ( see  @xcite ) :    * * unbroken   * : a stationary point with @xmath23 a global minimum of this type implies vanishing vacuum expectation value for the doublet fields  ( [ eq - doubldef ] ) and therefore the trivial behaviour with respect to the gauge group .",
    "the stationary points of this type are found by setting all higgs - doublet fields ( or correspondingly the @xmath19 as well as the @xmath24 fields ) in the potential to zero and requiring a vanishing gradient with respect to the remaining real fields : @xmath25 * * fully broken   * : a stationary point with @xmath26 a global minimum of this type has non - vanishing vacuum expectation values for the charged components of the doublets fields in  ( [ eq - doubldef ] ) , thus leads to a fully broken   , see  @xcite .",
    "the stationary points of this type are found by requiring a vanishing gradient with respect to all singlet fields and all gauge invariant functions : @xmath27 the constraints   on the gauge invariant functions must be checked explicitly for the real solutions found . * * partially broken   * : a stationary point with @xmath28 for a global minimum of this type follows the desired partial breaking of   down to   , see  @xcite . using the lagrange method , these stationary points are given by the real solutions of the system of equations @xmath29 & = 0 , \\\\",

    ". the inequality in   must be checked explicitly for the solutions found for  .    for a potential which is bounded from below",
    ", the global minima will be among these stationary points . solving the systems of equations  , , and , and inserting the solutions in the potential",
    ", we can therefore identify the global minima as those solutions which have the lowest value of the potential .",
    "note that in general there can be more than one global minimum point .",
    "from the mathematical point of view we have with  ( [ eq - stationarityu ] , [ eq - stationarityf ] , [ eq - stationarityp ] ) to solve non - linear , multivariate , inhomogeneous systems of polynomial equations of third order .",
    "we want to demonstrate that this is possible , even if the number of fields is large , like in the nmssm .",
    "the most involved case is given by  ( [ eq - stationarityp ] ) , which for the nmssm consists of seven equations in seven indeterminates , namely six real fields and one lagrange multiplier .",
    "we stress that at this point we assume the number of complex solutions of  ( [ eq - stationarityu ] , [ eq - stationarityf ] , [ eq - stationarityp ] ) to be finite , that is , we have systems of equations with a finite number of solutions .",
    "the gauge invariant functions avoid spurious continuous sets of complex solutions , which we found to arise in the case of the mssm as well as the nmssm if the stability conditions are formulated with respect to the higgs fields   in a unitary gauge .",
    "the solution of multivariate polynomial systems of equations is the subject of polynomial ideal theory and can be obtained algorithmically in the groebner basis approach  @xcite .",
    "see appendix  [ ap - buchberger ] for a brief introduction to this subject . within this approach",
    "the system of equations is transformed into a unique standard form with respect to a specified underlying ordering of the polynomial summands ( _ monomials _ ) .",
    "this unique standard form of the system of equations is given by the corresponding _ reduced groebner basis_. if the underlying order is the _ lexicographical _ ordering , the unique standard form consists of equations with a partial separation in the indeterminates .",
    "we use a variant of the @xmath31 algorithm  @xcite to compute the groebner bases .",
    "a groebner basis computation is generally much faster if the standard form is computed with respect to _ total degree _ orderings and then transformed into a lexicographical groebner basis .",
    "the transformation of bases from total degree to lexicographical ordering is done with the help of the fglm algorithm  @xcite .",
    "finally , the system of equations represented by the lexicographical groebner basis has to be triangularised .",
    "the decomposition of the system of equations with a finite number of solutions into triangular sets is performed with the algorithm introduced in  @xcite .",
    "each triangular system consists of one univariate equation , one equation in @xmath32 indeterminates , one equation in @xmath33 indeterminates and so forth .",
    "this means that the solutions are found by subsequently solving just univariate equations by inserting the solutions from the previous steps .",
    "the construction of the groebner basis as well as the triangularisation are done algebraically , so no approximations are needed . however",
    ", the triangular system of equations contains in general polynomials of high order , where the zeros can not be obtained algebraically . here",
    "numerical methods are needed to find the in general complex roots of the univariate polynomials .    in more involved potentials , like the nmssm , the algorithmic solution is considerably simplified ( or even made accessible ) , if the coefficients of the polynomials are given in form of rational numbers . since rational numbers are arbitrarily close to real numbers and moreover the physical parameters are given only with a certain precision this does not limit the general applicability of the method in practice .",
    "all algorithms for the computation of the groebner basis with respect to a given order of the monomials , the change of the underlying order , the triangularisation , and the solution of the triangular systems are implemented in the singular program package  @xcite .",
    "the solutions obtained can be easily checked by inserting them into the initial system of equations . moreover , the number of complex solutions , that is the multiplicity of the system , is known , so we can easily check that no stationary point is missing .",
    "now , we want to apply the methods introduced in section  [ method ] to the nmssm .      the nmssm higgs sector contains two doublets and one singlet , @xmath34 with the tree level higgs potential  @xcite , where @xmath35 .",
    "\\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use the notation @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the @xmath40 and @xmath41 gauge couplings , respectively .",
    "the parameters of the potential are given by the experimentally fixed electroweak gauge couplings and @xmath42 the quartic terms of the potential  ( [ eq - nmssmpot ] ) are positive for any non - trivial field configuration , if both @xmath43 are non - vanishing .",
    "the potential is therefore bounded from below for all cases considered here , and stability has not to be checked any further .",
    "we translate the nmssm higgs potential to the formalism described in the previous section , where we decompose the complex singlet field into two real fields according to . in this notation",
    "the potential is given by @xmath44 for given values of the potential parameters we can find all stationary points of the nmssm by solving the systems of equations  ( [ eq - stationarityu ] , [ eq - stationarityf ] , [ eq - stationarityp ] ) as described above .      in order to fix experimentally known parameters like the electroweak scale",
    "it is inappropriate to choose numerical values for the parameter set  .",
    "instead , we express different original parameters in terms of the desired vacuum expectation values of the neutral components of the higgs doublets and the higgs singlet , the mass of the charged higgs boson and a -violating phase . to this end",
    "we introduce the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields , @xmath45 which are parametrised by @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and the phases @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "the stationarity condition of the potential at the vacuum values for the fields requires a vanishing gradient with respect to the higgs fields .",
    "these equations relate the soft - breaking mass parameters with the vacuum expectation values . as usual",
    ", we define @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "further , if we write the complex parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 in polar coordinates with phases @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and introduce the abbreviations @xmath61 the initial parameters of the potential  ( [ eq - par ] ) can be replaced by the new set of parameters @xmath62 plus the electroweak scale @xmath0  gev . note , that it is not sufficient to supply the length @xmath63 , in addition we have to fix the sign of @xmath64 in the mass matrix of the higgs scalars , the violating entries which mix the `` scalar '' with the `` pseudoscalar '' fields are proportional to the imaginary part of @xmath65 $ ] .      as a numerical example",
    "we choose the parameter values @xmath66 and consider the variation of one parameter at a time with the values of the other parameters in   kept fixed . for a given point in parameter space",
    "we compute all stationary points of the nmssm potential as described above .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ stationarity ] the groebner basis construction is performed with numerical coefficients .",
    "here we use a precision of @xmath67 digits for the input parameters  ( [ eq - par ] ) , which are determined from the values for the parameters  .",
    "the roots of the univariate polynomials are found numerically , where we choose a precision of @xmath68 digits .",
    "our approach allows to use arbitrary precisions in both cases .",
    "we verify that the errors of the approximate statements described in the following are under control . for generic values of the parameters we find @xmath69 complex solutions : @xmath70 corresponding to the unbroken , @xmath71 to the partially broken , and @xmath70 to the fully broken cases .",
    "the number of real and therefore relevant solutions depends on the specific values of the parameters .    as expected from the @xmath72 symmetry of the potential , we find either 1 or 3 solutions sharing the same value of the potential within the accuracy of the numerical roots . from the computed stationary points only those may be accepted as global minima which correspond to the initial vacuum expectation values ( up to the complex phases ) , that is which fulfil @xmath73 since for non - vanishing @xmath43 the potential is bounded from below ,",
    "the stationary point with the lowest value of the potential is the global minimum .",
    "further , we determine for every stationary solution , whether it is a local maximum , local minimum or a saddle point . for the regular solutions , i.e.",
    "the partially- and fully - broken cases , this is achieved via the bordered hessian matrix  ( see for instance  @xcite ) in terms of @xmath74 .",
    "this takes all powers of the doublet fields into account , which allows for a definite decision on the type of the stationary point also for frequently encountered partial breaking solutions where at least one mass squared is zero and the others have the same sign . for irregular solutions , i.e. the non - breaking solutions with @xmath75 , the lagrange formalism can not be used since the gradients of the two boundary conditions with respect to @xmath76 become linearly dependent .",
    "instead we resubstitute the original fields @xmath77 in this case and consider the free hessian matrix with respect to these fields .",
    "this turns out to be sufficient in practice to judge on the type of the stationary points",
    ".    figures  [ fig - lambda ] and [ fig - delta ] show the values of the potential at all stationary points for the parameter values  ( [ eq - centralvals ] ) and the cases where successively one of the parameters @xmath78 is varied .",
    "each curve in the figures represents 1- or 3-fold degenerate stationary potential values , where the gauge symmetry breaking behaviour of the solutions is denoted by different line styles .",
    "excluded parameter regions , where the global minimum does not exhibit the required expectation values  ( [ eq - vac ] ) are drawn shaded . as is illustrated by the figures we find that substantial regions of the nmssm parameter space are excluded .",
    "for some excluded parameter regions , the partially breaking solutions with the required vacuum expectation values  ( [ eq - vac ] ) are saddle points ( see for instance fig .",
    "[ fig - lambda ] , top ) .",
    "this means they can be discarded as global minima without calculation of the other stationary points .",
    "however , this is not always the case . obviously from fig .",
    "[ fig - vs ] , top , we find an upper bound for @xmath48 . for the plotted @xmath48 larger than this upper exclusion bound the solutions fulfilling  ( [ eq - vac ] ) are still pronounced minima , i.e. the mass matrices have positive eigenvalues , but they are no longer the global minima .",
    "the influence of the violating phase @xmath79 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - delta ] , bottom .",
    "note that @xmath80 is not a symmetry of the potential .",
    "however , the potential is invariant under @xmath81 , that is @xmath82 , if the residual phases are chosen as in  ( [ eq - centralvals ] ) .",
    "therefore the stationary values of the potential in fig .",
    "[ fig - delta ] depend only on @xmath83 .",
    "also we want to note that in all figures shown here there is a non - breaking stationary point with potential values slightly above that of the _ wanted _ global minimum .",
    "we find that this effect is not coincidental for the parameters  ( [ eq - centralvals ] ) chosen here , but rather a generic feature of the nmssm . within the conserving parameter range @xmath840,1],\\quad \\kappa \\in \\,]0,1],\\quad a_\\kappa \\in \\pm\\,]0,2500]\\text { gev},\\\\ \\tan\\beta \\in \\,]0,50],\\quad   v_s \\in \\,]0,5000]\\text { gev},\\\\m_{h^\\pm } \\in \\,]0,2500]\\text { gev } \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we find a typical separation of the potential values for these non - breaking solutions and the solutions with the required vacuum expectation values  ( [ eq - vac ] ) below the percent level , in many cases much smaller .",
    "we do not find fully breaking global minima for scenarios in the range   where the solutions with the required vacuum expectation values  ( [ eq - vac ] ) are local minima .",
    "eventually , we find examples , where conserving parameter values with the `` wrong '' global minimum produce the wanted global minimum if a non - vanishing phase @xmath79 is introduced .",
    "the stationarity conditions of higgs potentials at the tree - level lead in general to non - linear , multivariate , polynomial systems of equations .",
    "we have formulated the stationarity conditions by means of gauge invariant functions , thus avoiding to have to deal with electroweak gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "we have introduced the groebner basis approach to solve the systems of equations and have applied the method to the nmssm . within the groebner basis approach",
    "we have easily found all stationary solutions even with general violating parameters .",
    "we have demonstrated that large regions of the parameter space of the nmssm are excluded because they do not lead to the required global minimum .",
    "finally , we note that the method proposed here should also be applicable to other potentials which neither have to be restricted to two doublets nor even have to be renormalisable .",
    "we thank r.  barbieri and w.  wetzel for valuable discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the german bundesministerium fr bildung und forschung , project numbers hd05ht1vha/0 and hd05ht4vha/0 .",
    "in this appendix we want to sketch the construction of the buchberger algorithm which transforms a given set of polynomials  @xmath85 into a groebner basis  @xmath86 .",
    "the groebner basis  @xmath86 has exactly the same simultaneous zeros as the initial set of polynomials  @xmath85 , but allows better access to the actual calculation of these zeros .",
    "the general idea is to _ complete _ the set  @xmath85 by adjoining differences of polynomials .",
    "before we can present the algorithms themselves we have to introduce the two basic ingredients , that is _ reduction _ and the _ s - polynomial_. for a more detailed discussion we refer the reader to the literature  @xcite . here",
    "we follow closely  @xcite .",
    "first of all we recall some definitions .        in the following we want to consider an explicit example , that is a set @xmath92 $ ] of polynomials with rational coefficients : @xmath93 the set @xmath85 generates an ideal  @xmath94 , which is given by the set of sums of @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , where each polynomial is multiplied with another arbitrary polynomial from the ring @xmath98 $ ] .",
    "the summands of the polynomial are denoted as _",
    "monomials _ and each monomial is the product of a coefficient and a _",
    "power product_.    further , we introduce an _ ordering _ ( @xmath99 ) of the monomials . in the _ lexicographical",
    "ordering _",
    "( @xmath100 ) the monomials are ordered with respect to the power of each variable subsequently .",
    "the ring notation  @xmath98 $ ] defines @xmath101 , that is for the lexicographical ordering of monomials powers of @xmath102 are considered first , then powers of @xmath103 .",
    "explicitly , this means @xmath104 because the power of @xmath102 is larger in the first monomial and @xmath105 , because both monomials have the same power of  @xmath102 , but the first monomial has a larger power of  @xmath103 .",
    "the monomials of the polynomials  ( [ eq - poly ] ) from the ring @xmath98 $ ] are ordered with respect to lexicographical ordering . in _ total",
    "degree ordering _",
    "( @xmath106 ) the monomials are ordered with respect to the sum of powers in each monomial .",
    "if two monomials have the same sum of powers , they are ordered with respect to another ordering , for instance lexicographical . for polynomials in",
    "@xmath98 $ ] we have @xmath107 since the sum of powers of the left power product is @xmath33 compared to @xmath32 for the right power product .    the largest power product with respect to the underlying ordering ( @xmath99 ) of a polynomial  @xmath108 is denoted as the _ leading power product _ , @xmath109 , the corresponding coefficient as _ leading coefficient _ , @xmath110 .",
    "with help of these preparations we can define the two essential parts of the buchberger algorithm , that is _ reduction _ and the _ s - polynomial_.    reduction + let @xmath111}$ ] .",
    "we call @xmath108 reducible modulo @xmath112 , if for a power product @xmath113 of @xmath108 there exists a power product @xmath30 with @xmath114 .",
    "then we say , @xmath108 reduces to @xmath115 modulo @xmath112 , where @xmath116 .",
    "+      reduction of a polynomial modulo a set @xmath120}$ ] is accordingly defined if there is a @xmath121 such that @xmath108 is reducible modulo @xmath112 .",
    "further , we say , a polynomial  @xmath115 is in _ reduced form _ or _ normal form _",
    "modulo  @xmath85 , in short @xmath122 , if there is no @xmath123 such that @xmath115 reduces to @xmath123 modulo  @xmath85 .",
    "a set @xmath120}$ ] is called reduced , if each @xmath124 is in reduced form modulo @xmath125 .",
    "note that reduction is defined with respect to the underlying ordering of the monomials , since the leading power product is defined with respect to the ordering . in general , a normal form is not unique , neither for a polynomial nor for a set .",
    "note , that @xmath86 generates the same ideal as @xmath85 , especially , both sets have exactly the same simultaneous zeros .",
    "it can be proven , that the buchberger algorithm terminates as well as that the reduced groebner basis is unique  @xcite .",
    "if we apply the buchberger algorithm to the set  ( [ eq - poly ] ) with subsequent reduction we end up with the reduced groebner basis ( with underlying lexicographical ordering ) @xmath138 the system of equations @xmath139 is equivalent to @xmath140 , but the former allows to directly calculate the solutions : since @xmath141 is univariate it can be solved immediately and subsequently @xmath142 for each partial solution insertion .    despite the correctness of the buchberger algorithm tractability of practical examples requires to improve this algorithm . in particular",
    ", the number of iterations in the algorithm drastically grows with an increasing number of polynomials and with higher degrees of the polynomials . in this respect",
    "much progress has been made with the improvement of this original buchberger algorithm from 1965  ( see @xcite ) .",
