    "the reliable distinction between the body s own peptides and foreign ones is an essential prerequisite for the functioning of the immune system . on the one hand",
    ", a wide variety of pathogens has to be identified , even if they are as yet unknown to the organism . on the other hand",
    ", a response to the body s own molecules has to be avoided as this would result in dangerous auto - immune reactions .",
    "the first step in this chain of events is an encounter between a t - cell and an antigen - presenting cell ( apc ) .",
    "the apc displays a mixture of self and foreign antigens on its surface ( a sample of the molecules around in the body ) ; the t - cell examines the apc by means of its receptors and ultimately decides whether or not to react , i.e. , to start an immune response . to be biologically more precise , we consider the encounters of so - called naive t - cells with professional apcs in the secondary lymphoid tissue .",
    "a naive t - cell is a cell that has completed its maturation process in the thymus and has been released into the body , where it has not yet been exposed to antigens .",
    "it tends to dwell in secondary lymphoid tissue like lymph nodes , where it comes into contact with professional apcs , special white blood cells with so - called mhc molecules at their surface that serve as carriers for antigens .    despite the enormous challenge ( one or a few foreign types of potentially dangerous foreign molecules",
    "must be discerned against a huge variety of harmless self molecules ) , the immune system takes the appropriate decision in the overwhelming majority of cases .",
    "there are two prerequisites to this ability .",
    "first , there is a large number ( estimated at @xmath5 in humans and @xmath6 in mice @xcite ) of different t - cell receptors ( tcrs ) present in an individual .",
    "each t - cell is characterised by one such receptor ( which is displayed in many copies on the surface of the particular t - cell ) . for virtually every foreign invader",
    ", there is at least one receptor that fits to at least one of the derived antigens and can thus elicit an immune response .",
    "second , there is a maturation process in the thymus known as negative selection , which every young t - cell must undergo before it is released into the periphery ( i.e. , the remaining body , except the thymus ) . during this process ,",
    "the t - cell encounters numerous apcs , in an analogous way as described above , but these apcs only present self antigens .",
    "t - cells that react in such encounters are eliminated ; the surviving ones thus have little or no self - reactivity . according to this brief summary",
    ", the mechanism appears to be sufficiently clear ",
    "but there are deep problems beneath the surface .",
    "on the one hand , there is no guarantee for any antigen - receptor pair , that the antigen is either recognised or not recognised .",
    "in fact , the interaction between these molecules , and the resulting stimulation rates delivered to the cell , varies continuously , depending on the relevant association and dissociation rates .",
    "this molecular background enables a substantial crossreactivity ( or promiscuity ) , i.e. , a given t cell receptor can show significant stimulation to a large number of different antigens .",
    "crossreactivity enables a large ( @xmath7 ) , but restricted repertoire of t - cell receptors to interact with an even wider range of possible antigens ( @xmath8  @xcite ) .",
    "the picture is further complicated by the presentation of antigens in more or less arbitrary mixtures on the apc surface .",
    "information about individual antigens is difficult to extract , and the t - cell faces a needle - in - a - haystack problem in the periphery , where it has to distinguish foreign antigens against a large , fluctuating self background .",
    "[ .5 ]    [ fig:01 ]    the first approach that deals with these complications is the model by van den berg , rand , and burroughs @xcite , henceforth referred to as brb .",
    "this model takes into account the probabilistic nature of the problem resulting from the observations above .",
    "it comes in a basic version ( without negative selection ) , which is not in itself biologically realistic but sheds light on some important aspects of foreign - self distinction in the periphery , in particular , the dependence on copy numbers of antigens ( i.e. , on antigen presentation ) ; and an extended version which includes a first version of negative selection .",
    "knowledge of the negative selection process and , in particular , an understanding of how tolerance to tissue - restricted antigens could be achieved , is still limited .",
    "tissue - restricted antigens ( tras ) are derived from proteins that are only expressed in specialised tissues ( as opposed to constitutive antigens that are expressed in every cell ) . in the thymus ,",
    "medullary thymic epithelial cells ( mtecs ) are able to express tras in order to mediate negative selection .    two alternative ( extreme ) modes of how tras might be presented in the thymus are under discussion  @xcite .",
    "according to the details of their respective genetic mechanisms , they are known as developmental model and terminal differentiation model , respectively , in the biological literature , but we would like to call them emulation model and mixture model , respectively , for the sake of the immediate intuitive appeal to the nonspecialist .",
    "emulation means correlated expression that mimics particular cell lineages or tissues . alternatively , under a mixture model , arbitrary antigens including tras would be expressed in an uncorrelated , stochastic fashion ( i.e. , every mtec would express random samples of antigens , of mixed tissue origin ) .",
    "the word `` model '' should not ( yet ) be understood in the sense of a mathematical model ; in fact , these models have , as yet , been only formulated verbally .",
    "it is obvious that an emulation model can work in principle , provided the number of possible tissues or cell types is not too large and antigen presentation is emulated correctly .",
    "problems may arise , however , if copy numbers fluctuate greatly .",
    "this is the case , for example , in secretive tissues , where certain proteins occur at times in copy numbers so large that are hard to conceive in the thymus  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is entirely unclear whether mixture models can work at all . after all , they require that ` dangerous ' stimulation rates be detected within their mixture  a needle - in - a - haystack problem similar to foreign recognition against a self background in the periphery",
    ".    theoretical results on negative selection are sparse , in particular within the probabilistic framework .",
    "the aim of this article therefore is to explore a probabilistic model of negative selection building on the approach of brb .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : brb ] , we will review the basic brb model ( i.e. , without negative selection ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : negselect ] , we present a mathematical formulation for the inclusion of negative selection into the brb model .",
    "our advanced model requires individual - based t - cell modelling and simulation to explore the effects of negative selection to foreign - self discrimination . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim ] we develop a suitable simulation approach for that purpose . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we examine our model of negative t - cell selection in dependence on various model parameters .",
    "more precisely , we explore the effects of the two contrasting modes of antigen presentation in thymus .",
    "it will turn out that negative selection improves the power of foreign - self discrimination due to a truncation of the tails of stimulation rate distributions .",
    "the brb model ( as introduced in  @xcite and further analysed in  @xcite,@xcite , and @xcite ) was the first to take into account the probabilistic nature of foreign - self antigen recognition , as justified in the light of the vast variety of both t - cell receptors and possible antigens , and the problems discussed in the introduction .",

    "the task now is to distinguish the single foreign antigen in  ( [ formula : basicbrb ] ) against the large self - background .",
    "this appears difficult since , by the i.i.d .",
    "assumption on the @xmath26 ( for all @xmath53 ) , there is no a - priori information about the nature of the antigen ( recall that negative selection is not yet in place ) . to see whether and how recognition may work nevertheless , one considers the _ activation probability _ @xmath54 , i.e. , the probability of a single t - cell to become activated during an encounter . assuming a total of @xmath55 t - cells that get in contact with apcs that present a given foreign antigen , the two crucial probabilities are @xmath56 and @xmath57 the symbols @xmath58 and @xmath59 are chosen deliberately because of the relationship with a false positive and a false negative , respectively : @xmath58 is the probability of an autoimmune reaction , whereas @xmath59 is the probability that a foreign antigen goes unnoticed .",
    "we have no good knowledge of @xmath55 ( except that it is bounded above by the number of t - cell types ) , but it is clear that a necessary condition for distinction is that @xmath0 can be chosen in such a way that , for physiologically realistic values of @xmath1 , @xmath60 there then is a region of intermediate values of @xmath55 for which both @xmath58 and @xmath59 are small .",
    "we will , therefore , mainly investigate the validity of ( [ eq : act_probs ] ) in what follows .",
    "let us briefly summarize some previous results for the brb model that will become essential for the understanding of negative selection .",
    "the difficulty of the analysis lies in the small probabilities involved : both probabilities in ( [ eq : act_probs ] ) are of the order of @xmath61 or less .",
    "analysis of these tail events requires simulation .",
    "the approach presented by lipsmeier and baake  @xcite uses large deviation theory to design an asymptotically efficient simulation method ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sim ] below ) . in agreement with previous results",
    "@xcite , the authors showed that inequality  ( [ eq : act_probs ] ) may be satisfied provided @xmath62 , see fig .  [ fig:03 ] .",
    "moreover , lipsmeier and baake  investigated the contributions of the constitutive and the variable stimulation rates to the self background , i.e. , the contribution of the constitutive sum and the variable sum to @xmath63 .",
    "they illustrated a fundamental difference between variable and constitutive antigens .",
    "variable stimulation rates are approximately normally distributed and fairly closely peaked around their mean .",
    "this feature even persists for subsets of samples for which @xmath64 , for various @xmath0 .",
    "so , the variable antigens form a kind of background that poses no difficulty to foreign - self distinction : it is not very noisy , and it does not change with @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , due to the large copy numbers ( @xmath65 ) , the distribution of the constitutive activation rates is wider and moves to the right with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the constitutive sum forms a fluctuating , hard - to - predict background , against which it is hard to stand out for a foreign antigen .",
    "this demonstrates that those self antigens that are present in high copy numbers set the limit of foreign - self distinction .    due to these findings ( many more details may be found in  @xcite and  @xcite ) we may restrict attention to the set of relevant antigen types ( that is , those that may appear in copy numbers high enough to cause problems  a specification deliberately vague to leave room for interpretation ) . in our simplified model ,",
    "every apc in the periphery is assumed to present @xmath66 of these , all at the same copy number @xmath67 , where now @xmath68 , and @xmath1 is the copy number of the one foreign antigen type that is ( maybe ) also presented , as before .",
    "the total stimulation rate in the periphery then is @xmath69 with @xmath70 ( in correspondence with @xmath33 , @xmath36 ) , the activation curves of our simplified model show qualitatively the same behaviour as for the original brb model ( see fig .  [ fig:03 ] ) , i.e. , ( [ eq : act_probs ] ) holds for @xmath62 and sufficiently large values of @xmath0 .    ) ; right : activation curves in the simplified t cell model ( [ formula : simplifiedbrb ] ) with @xmath71 and @xmath72 . ]",
    "in order to model the process called negative selection ( see  @xcite for a review of the biological details ) , one postulates a second threshold @xmath73 with a similar role as @xmath0 . if the stimulation rate of a young t - cell in its maturation phase in the thymus ( where it meets several apcs that only present self - peptides ) exceeds this threshold in at least one out of @xmath74 encounters ( known as _ rounds _ of negative selection ) , then the t - cell is induced to die .",
    "the estimates of @xmath74 vary greatly : it may be estimated to over 2000 ( from the sojourn of a young t - cell in the thymus of 45 days  @xcite , and the duration of a t - apc - meeting of 3 minutes  @xcite ) , but this contrasts with earlier findings of much lower values  @xcite .",
    "altogether , a fraction @xmath75 of all t - cells is deleted during negative selection .",
    "estimates are usually in the range of 50% - 65%  @xcite , but these values suffer from the limitations of the underlying biological models .    as to the self antigens presented ,",
    "a pivotal parameter is @xmath76 , the number of potentially immunogenic self - antigens .",
    "one often estimates @xmath77  @xcite ; a more recent bioinformatics analysis arrives at @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "it is sometimes appropriate to distinguish between all @xmath76 self antigens and those that may eventually appear in high copy numbers , since only these will cause problems ( cf . the discussion in sec .",
    "[ subsec : resultsbrb ] ) .",
    "let us denote their number by @xmath79 .",
    "the value of @xmath80 can only be guessed ; we will speculate that maybe some 10% of all self antigens belong to this class .",
    "let us now turn to our model of negative selection .      in our ( crudely simplifying ) model ,",
    "a round of negative selection is given by an encounter of an ( immature ) t cell and an apc presenting @xmath66 self antigens .",
    "a given t cell survives negative selection , if during @xmath74 rounds , in each of which a fresh apc @xmath81 , @xmath82 , is presented , the total stimulation rate it perceives never exceeds @xmath73 . the event ` survival of negative selection ' is then defined by @xmath83 .",
    "the question now is whether or not foreign - self distinction will work on the negatively selected t - cell repertoire in the periphery .",
    "hence , the crucial quantity turns into the _ conditional activation probability _ @xmath84 .",
    "investigation of conditional activation probabilities requires explicit individual - based t - cell modelling , as self antigens may be encountered several times during negative selection .",
    "that is , each t - cell is given by a full set of stimulation rates . in our model",
    ", we restrict attention to the stimulation rates received from the @xmath80 ` relevant antigens ' . apcs present random samples of these , all at the same copy number @xmath85 ( or @xmath67 respectively ) .",
    "more precisely , our model ( a first version of which appears in @xcite ) reads as follows :    1 .",
    "@xmath86 is the set of relevant antigens . 2 .",
    "t - cell @xmath42 is defined by its stimulation rates to _ all _ relevant self antigens , i.e. , @xmath87 .",
    "the @xmath26 are i.i.d .",
    "@xmath88 , drawn once and fixed for the entire life of the t - cell .",
    "3 .   an apc @xmath81 presents ( and is defined by ) a subset of @xmath66 of all self antigens , i.e. , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , where the @xmath91 are all independent . the elements of every @xmath91 are drawn from @xmath92 due to the presumed model of thymic antigen presentation ( mixture model or emulation model respectively , cf .",
    "[ sec : apcmodels ] ) .",
    "one foreign antigen type can also be present , at @xmath1 copies .",
    "every self antigen is displayed at the same copy number @xmath67 , @xmath93 .",
    "when @xmath43 meets @xmath91 , it adds together the stimulation rates it assigns to this apc s antigens , i.e. , @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , independent of the other @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath43 survives negative selection if @xmath96 .",
    "a surviving t cell is activated in the periphery if @xmath97 .",
    "note that , for notational simplicity , our definition of the @xmath91 only contains the self antigens ( and no copy numbers ) , it is not an exhaustive description of the apcs .",
    "let us now specify the sampling approach for the generation of the @xmath91 , i.e. , step 3 in the model above .",
    "the mixture model argues for an arbitrary , uncorrelated tra expression .",
    "hence , under the mixture model , we assume that the @xmath91 are sampled by drawing from @xmath92 independently and without replacement .    for the emulation model , imitation of particular tissues or cell lineages",
    "is achieved by partitioning of @xmath92 into @xmath98 subsets @xmath99  @xcite . for simplicity , we presume subsets @xmath100 , to be distinct and of identical size @xmath101 .",
    "now , an apc @xmath81 represents a subset of @xmath66 self antigens originating preferentially from one particular subset @xmath102 . for each round @xmath81 of negative selection ,",
    "@xmath103 is drawn from @xmath104 independently and with replacement .",
    "given @xmath103 , a _",
    "strict emulation model _ scenario ( in a sense that the tras presented by an apc originate exclusively from one particular subset ) is modelled straightforwardly by drawing the elements of @xmath91 from @xmath105 independently and without replacement .",
    "however , more moderate scenarios of emulation can be obtained by introducing an additional parameter @xmath106 , which defines the probability of any given tra to originate from @xmath102 .",
    "tras not originating from @xmath102 are drawn from @xmath107 independently and without replacement . in our model , setting @xmath108 would be equivalent to the mixture model , while @xmath109 yields a strict emulation model scenario . hence",
    ", varying @xmath110 allows us to adjust the model continuously between the two extreme cases , with intermediate scenarios in which the tras in @xmath102 are presented preferentially , but not exclusively .",
    "our task is to simulate the conditional activation probability    @xmath111    where @xmath4 is the event @xmath112 .",
    "the probability of the corresponding _ unconditional _ event @xmath113 may be simulated in the way outlined in  @xcite ( after all , it is a simplified version of the basic brb model , defined by a weighted sum of i.i.d .",
    "random variables ) .",
    "more precisely , one faces the usual problem that the simple - sampling estimate , @xmath114 where @xmath115 denotes the indicator function and @xmath116 is the number of t - cells simulated ( i.e. , sample size ) , is hopelessly inefficient because the event is so rare . instead ,",
    "a special variant of importance sampling is employed : denoting by @xmath117 the ` natural ' density , one draws @xmath118 from the density @xmath119 obtained from @xmath117 by exponential reweighting according to @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the _ tilting parameter _ ( to be specified below ) , and @xmath122 is the moment - generating function of @xmath63 .",
    "one then uses the importance sampling estimate @xmath123 here , @xmath124 serves as a reweighting factor from the ` artificial ' to the natural density and guarantees that the estimate is unbiased and converges to the true probability as @xmath125 .",
    "the optimal choice for @xmath126 is well known to be the solution of @xmath127 cf .",
    "that is , the tilting is performed in such a way as to transform the rare event into a typcial one . for this choice of @xmath126 ,",
    "the importance sampling algorithm is known to be asymptotically efficient .",
    "that is , the number of samples required to keep the relative error ( i.e. , the standard deviation of the estimated probability divided by the true probability ) below a prescribed bound increases only subexponentially with @xmath66 ( if the problem is embedded into a certain sequence of problems with increasing @xmath66 and with @xmath0 scaled accordingly  @xcite ) , rather than exponentially as with simple sampling .    in practice",
    ", this is only useful if the underlying distribution has some further structure that may be exploited ",
    "otherwise , the calculation of @xmath126 according to ( [ eq : tiltparam ] ) requires the calculation of the full distribution of @xmath63 , which includes the probability we want to estimate . in the unconditional case considered so far ,",
    "the independence of the summands of @xmath63 ( and the ensuing factorisation of the moment - generating function @xmath128 lets the problem boil down to tilting the individual @xmath26 with parameter @xmath129 ( that is , sampling new random variables @xmath130 from @xmath131 , the tilted version of @xmath31 , where @xmath132 or @xmath133 , depending on the weighting factor the @xmath26 is associated with ) . in line with ( [ eq : tiltparam ] ) , @xmath126 is chosen so that @xmath134 + z_f\\mathbb{e}_{\\varphi^{z_f\\vartheta}}[\\bar{w } ] = { g_\\textrm{act}}.\\ ] ] note that we use a bar throughout to indicate tilted random variables , but the individual tilting parameters do vary , as indicated by the superscript of @xmath31 .    the above is an obvious variant of the method used in  @xcite ; for details , in particular on how to actually perform the tilting and the simulation in an efficient and numerically precise way , see this reference . in practice , in the application  @xcite , the increase in computation time turned out to be only roughly linear in the number of terms in the sum , and simulation time was reduced by up to a factor of more than 1000 relative to simple sampling .    in the present context , however , we need to simulate the conditional probability in  ( [ formula : condactprob ] ) . again , we are interested in rare events , but now we have to take care of the fact that , after negative selection , the @xmath135 are not independent of a given t - cell . there is therefore no structure available that might simplify the evaluation of @xmath126 in the analogue of  ( [ eq : tiltparam ] ) , i.e. , @xmath136 ( where the overbar again indicates the tilted random variable ) .",
    "we will , in what follows , present an unbiased importance sampling algorithm that uses a heuristic tilting scheme and is far from asymptotically efficient but makes simulations just feasible on a standard pc .    by definition , @xmath137 we have mentioned before that @xmath138 is not small ( in the sense of large deviations ) ; but the event @xmath139 is even rarer than @xmath140 for the relevant ( large ) @xmath0 .",
    "there is no obvious importance sampling strategy for the latter probability , but we propose to adapt the tilting scheme that would apply if the two events were independent , in which case @xmath141 .",
    "@xmath142 can be handled in the following way .",
    "note that , since the @xmath26 that define @xmath43 are i.i.d .",
