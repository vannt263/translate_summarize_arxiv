    "since 2006 , inpop ( integration numerique planetaire de lobservatoire de paris ) has become an international reference for space navigation ( to be used for the gaia mission navigation and the analysis of the gaia observations ) and for scientific research in dynamics of the solar system objects and in fundamental physics . a first version of inpop , inpop06 ,",
    "was published in 2008 ( fienga et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this version is very close to the reference ephemerides of jpl in its dynamic model and in its fit procedure . with mex and vex",
    "tracking data provided by esa , lunar laser ranging observations and the development of new planetary and moon ephemeris models and new adjustment methods , inpop08 ( fienga et al . 2009 ) and inpop10a ( fienga et al . 2011 ) were constructed .",
    "these versions of inpop have established inpop at the forefront of global planetary ephemerides because its precision in terms of extrapolation to the position of planets is equivalent to the jpl ephemerides .",
    "its dynamic model follows the recommendations of the international astronomical union ( iau ) in terms of i ) compatibility between time scales ( tt , tdb ) , ii ) metric in the relativistic equations of motion ( consistency in the computation of the position of the barycenter of the solar system ) and iii ) in the fit of the sun gravitational mass with a fixed au .",
    "inpop provides to the user , positions and velocities of the planets , the moon , the rotation angles of the earth and the moon as well as tt - tdb chebychev polynomials at @xmath0 .",
    "inpop10a was the first planetary ephemerides in the world built up with a direct estimation of the gravitational mass of the sun with a fixed astronomical unit instead of the traditional adjustment of the au scale factor .",
    "with inpop10a , we have demonstrated the feasibility of such determination helping the iau of taking the decision of fixing the astronomical unit ( see resolution b2 of the 35th iau general assembly , 2012 ) .",
    "the inpop01e is the latest inpop version developed for the gaia mission final release and available for users .",
    "compared to inpop10a , new sophisticated procedures related to the asteroid mass determinations have been implemented : bounded value least squares have been associated with a - priori sigma estimators ( kuchynka 2010 , fienga et al .",
    "2011 ) and solar plasma corrections ( verma et al .",
    "very recent uranus observations provided by ( viera martins and camaro 2012 ) have been added as well as positions of pluto deduced from hst ( tholen et al .",
    "for the llr fit , additionnal observations are available from cerga , mlrs2 , matera ( @xmath1 ) and apollo ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "adjustment of the gravitational mass of the sun is performed as recommended by the iau resolution b2 as well as the sun oblateness ( j@xmath3 ) , the ratio between the mass of the earth and the mass of the moon ( emrat ) and the mass of the earth - moon barycenter .",
    "estimated values are presented on table [ paramfita ] ."

    "<S> the use of planetary ephemerides for several physical applications are presented here from electronic densities of solar slow and fast winds to asteroid mass determinations and tests of general relativity operated with inpop10a . </S>",
