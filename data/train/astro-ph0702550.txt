    "as the co emission probably samples the envelope regions of molecular clouds , its dispersion may better represent the turbulent motions .",
    "therefore , we believe that a dispersion of @xmath104  =  1.0  km s@xmath43 is a good compromise to consider as input parameter in our computation .",
