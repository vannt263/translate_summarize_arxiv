    "understanding the behavior of high energy hadron reactions from a fundamental perspective within of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is an important goal of particle physics ( for recent reviews see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . attempts to test experimentally this sector of qcd started some years ago with the first experimental results from @xmath3 collisions at hera and @xmath4 collisions at tevatron .",
    "currently , there is a great expectation with respect to the first experimental results from hadron - hadron collisions at cern lhc @xcite .",
    "the central papers concerning the knowledge of the regge limit ( high energy limit ) of qcd were presented in the late 1970s by lipatov and collaborators @xcite . the physical effect that they describe is often referred to as the qcd pomeron , with the evolution described by the bfkl equation .",
    "one of main features of the bfkl evolution is the strong growth predicted for the cross sections , which implies that at very high energies the bfkl equation should be modified in order to include unitarization corrections @xcite .",
    "however , it is expected the existence of a kinematical window in the current and future accelerators in which the bfkl prediction should provide a good description of the experimental data ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in recent years",
    "our group has proposed the analysis of coherent interactions in hadronic collisions as an alternative way to study the qcd dynamics at high energies @xcite ( for related studies see @xcite ) .",
    "the basic idea in coherent hadronic collisions is that the total cross section for a given process can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons into the hadron projectile and the photon - photon or photon - target production cross section .",
    "the main advantage of using colliding hadrons and nuclear beams for studying photon induced interactions is the high equivalent photon energies and luminosities that can be obtained at existing and future accelerators ( for a review see ref .",
    "consequently , studies of @xmath5 interactions at the lhc could provide valuable information on the qcd dynamics .",
    "the photon - hadron interactions in hadron - hadron collisions can be divided into exclusive and inclusive reactions . in the former ,",
    "one given particle is produced while the target remains in the ground state ( or has only internal excitations ) , and , in the latter , the particle is produced together with one or more particles resulting from the dissociation of the target .",
    "the typical examples of these processes are the exclusive vector meson production and the inclusive heavy quark production , described by the reactions @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , respectively .",
    "recently , both processes have been discussed considering @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite collisions as an alternative to constrain the qcd dynamics at high energies ( for reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and the results demonstrate that their detection is feasible at the lhc .    in this paper",
    "we extend the previous studies to the diffractive vector meson photoproduction with hadron dissociation in the case of large momentum transfer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and estimate , for the first time , the corresponding cross section for @xmath10 collisions at lhc ( for related studies see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this process",
    "the @xmath0-channel color singlet carries large momentum transfer , which means that the square of the four momentum transferred across the associated rapidity gap , -@xmath0 , is large . differently from the diffractive processes studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , which are characterized by two rapidity gaps with the two hadrons remaining intact , now we still have two large rapidity gaps in the detector but one of the hadrons dissociates .",
    "one expects a rapidity gap between the proton , which emits the photon and remains intact , and the vector meson .",
    "concerning the other gap , we expect a vector meson on one side and a jet on the other , which balances the transverse momentum .",
    "the present study is motivated by the fact that the experimental data for the @xmath13 vector meson photoproduction at high @xmath0 in electron - proton collisions at hera can be quite well described using the impact factor representation and the non - forward bfkl solution @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a brief review of the formalism necessary for calculate the vector meson production at high-@xmath0 in photon - hadron and hadron - hadron collisions . in section [ results ]",
    "we present a comparison between our predictions with the @xmath3 hera data for @xmath13 production .",
    "moreover , we present our predictions considering @xmath10 and @xmath12 collisions for lhc energies .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we present a summary of our main conclusions .",
    "let us consider the hadron - hadron interaction at large impact parameter ( @xmath14 ) and ultra - relativistic energies . in this regime",
    "we expect dominance of the electromagnetic interaction . in heavy ion colliders ,",
    "the heavy nuclei give rise to strong electromagnetic fields due to the coherent action of all protons in the nucleus , which can interact with each other .",
    "similarly , this also occurs when considering ultra - relativistic protons in @xmath15 colliders .",
    "the photon emitted from the electromagnetic field of one of the two colliding hadrons can interact with one photon of the other hadron ( two - photon process ) or directly with the other hadron ( photon - hadron process ) .",
    "the total cross section for a given process can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons of the hadron projectile and the photon - photon or photon - target production cross section @xcite . in general , the cross sections for @xmath16 interactions are two ( or three ! ) orders of magnitude larger than for @xmath17 interactions ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in what follows",
    "we will focus on photon - hadron processes . for a discussion of the double vector meson production at high-@xmath0 in @xmath17 and ultra - peripheral heavy ion collisions",
    "@xcite . considering the requirement that in photoproduction there is no hadronic interaction ( ultra - peripheral collision ) an analytical approximation for the equivalent photon flux of a nucleus can be calculated , and is given by @xcite @xmath18\\ , \\label{fluxint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the photon energy , @xmath20 is the lorentz boost of a single beam ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the modified bessel functions .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "( [ fluxint ] ) will be used in our calculations of @xmath13 photoproduction in @xmath12 collisions . for proton - proton interactions",
    "we assume that the photon spectrum is given by @xcite , @xmath25   \\left ( \\ln{\\omega } - \\frac{11}{6 } + \\frac{3}{\\omega }   - \\frac{3}{2 \\,\\omega^2 } + \\frac{1}{3 \\,\\omega^3 } \\right ) \\ , , \\label{eq : photon_spectrum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the notation @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 \\approx ( \\omega/ \\gamma_l)^2 $ ] .    the cross section for the diffractive @xmath13 photoproduction at large momentum transfer in a coherent hadron - hadron collision is given by @xmath28}{dy dt } = \\omega \\frac{dn_{\\gamma } ( \\omega ) } { d\\omega } \\,\\frac{d \\sigma_{\\gamma h \\rightarrow j/\\psi   x}}{dt}\\left(\\omega \\right)\\ , \\label{dsigdydt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 means the presence of a rapidity gap and the rapidity @xmath30 of the vector meson produced is directly related to the photon energy @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath31 . moreover , @xmath32 is the differential cross section for the process @xmath33 .",
    "( [ dsigdydt ] ) implies that , given the photon flux , the double differential cross section is a direct measure of the photoproduction cross section for a given energy and squared momentum transfer .",
    "some comments are in order here .",
    "first , the coherence condition restricts the photon virtuality to very low values , which implies that for most purposes , the photons can be considered as real .",
    "moreover , if we consider @xmath34 collisions at lhc , the lorentz factor is @xmath35 , which gives the maximum c.m . @xmath36",
    "energy @xmath37 gev .",
    "therefore , while studies of photoproduction at hera are limited to photon - proton center of mass energies of about 200 gev , photon - hadron interactions at lhc can reach one order of magnitude higher on energy .",
    "consequently , studies of coherent interactions at lhc could provide valuable information on the qcd dynamics at high energies .",
    "the differential cross section @xmath38 for the diffractive @xmath13 photoproduction at large momentum transfer can be obtained using the impact factor representation , proposed by cheng and wu @xcite many years ago ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this representation , the amplitude for a large-@xmath39 hard collision process can be factorized in three parts : the impact factors of the colliding particles and the green s function of two interacting reggeized gluons , which is determined by the bfkl equation and is represented by @xmath40 in what follows .",
    "the amplitude for the generic high energy process @xmath41 can be expressed on the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the impact factors for the upper and lower parts of the diagram , respectively .  that is , they are the impact factors for the processes @xmath45 and @xmath46 with two gluons carrying transverse momenta @xmath47 and @xmath48 attached .",
    "these gluons are in an overall color singlet state . at lowest order the process",
    "is described by two gluon exchange , which implies @xmath49 and an energy independent cross section . at higher order ,",
    "the dominant contribution is given by the qcd pomeron singularity which is generated by the ladder diagrams with the ( reggeized ) gluon exchange along the ladder .",
    "the qcd pomeron is described by the bfkl equation @xcite , with the exchange of a gluon ladder with interacting gluons generating a cross sections which increases with the energy .",
    "as our goal is the analysis of the vector meson production at large @xmath50 , we will use in our calculations the non - forward solution of the bfkl equation in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) , obtained by lipatov in ref.@xcite .    as discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , at large momentum transfer the pomeron couples predominantly to individual partons in the hadron .",
    "this implies that the cross section for the photon - hadron interaction can be expressed by the product of the parton level cross section and the parton distribution of the hadron , @xmath51 \\ , \\frac{d\\sigma}{dt}(\\gamma q \\rightarrow v q)\\,\\ , , \\label{dsigdtdx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the gluon and quark distribution functions , respectively .",
    "the struck parton initiates a jet and carries a fraction @xmath54 of the longitudinal momentum of the incoming hadron , which is given by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the mass of the products of the target dissociation and @xmath57 is the mass of the target .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath54 is calculated considering the experimental cuts on @xmath56 .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite we calculate @xmath38 for the process @xmath58 by integrating eq .",
    "( [ dsigdtdx ] ) over @xmath54 in the region @xmath59 . the differential cross - section for the @xmath60 process , characterized by the invariant collision energy squared @xmath39 of the photon - hadron system ,",
    "is expressed in terms of the amplitude @xmath61 as follows @xmath62 the amplitude is dominated by its imaginary part , which we shall parametrize , as in @xcite , through a dimensionless quantity @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are defined by @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the mass of the vector meson , @xmath70 is the photon virtuality and @xmath71 is a characteristic scale related to @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in this paper",
    "we only consider @xmath74 . in lla",
    ", @xmath75 is arbitrary ( but must depend on the scale in the problem , see discussion below ) and @xmath76 is a constant . for completeness , we give the cross - section expressed in terms of @xmath77 , where the real part of the amplitude is neglected , @xmath78 this representation is rather convenient for the calculations performed below .    the bfkl amplitude , in the lla and lowest conformal spin ( @xmath79 ) , is given by  @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the momentum transferred , @xmath82 , ( the subscript denotes two - dimensional transverse vectors ) and @xmath83 is proportional to the bfkl kernel eigenvalues  @xcite with @xmath84 being the digamma function .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      let us compare our results with those presented in ref .",
    "@xcite where the diffractive @xmath13 photoproduction at @xmath85 in coherent interactions was calculated considering the color glass condensate formalism @xcite .",
    "both processes predict the presence of two rapidity gaps .",
    "our predictions are smaller than those shown in @xcite at least by a factor 1.5 .",
    "another background which is characterized by two rapidity gaps in the final state are diffractive hadron - hadron interactions : @xmath86 .",
    "recently , the exclusive @xmath13 and @xmath87 hadroproduction in @xmath88 collisions were estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite considering the pomeron - odderon fusion ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "although there is a large uncertainty in the predictions for pomeron - odderon fusion , it can be of the order of our predictions for the photoproduction of vector mesons . as pointed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the separation of odderon and photon contributions should be feasible by the analysis of the outgoing momenta distribution .",
    "furthermore , it is important to emphasize that the experimental separation from the process studied in this paper should be possible , since that differently from the processes discussed above , at large momentum transfer one of the projectiles dissociates .",
    "therefore , this process could be separated using the forward detectors proposed to be installed at lhc @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that several points in the present calculation deserve more detailed studies : the contribution of all conformal spins @xcite , the helicity flip of quarks @xcite , the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the bfkl dynamics @xcite and the corrections associated to the saturation effects @xcite . from previous studies  @xcite ,",
    "one expects the contribution of higher conformal spins to be small .",
    "however , the nlo corrections should modify the energy dependence of the @xmath16 cross section and consequently our predictions for the rapidity distributions and total cross sections . in order to estimate these modifications",
    "it is necessary to include the corrections to the bfkl pomeron , as it was done e.g. in @xcite , and for the @xmath89 impact transition factor  @xcite .",
    "we intend to take into account these contributions in future publications .",
    "the lhc offers a unique possibility to probe qcd in a new and hitherto unexplored regime . in particular",
    ", it will allow the study of coherent processes which are characterized by photon - hadron and photon - photon interactions . in this paper",
    "we have restricted our study to @xmath16 interactions and extended previous analysis to the diffractive @xmath13 photoproduction together with hadron dissociation with large momentum transfer .",
    "the rapidity distribution and total cross sections were estimated considering distinct center - of - mass energies and projectiles using the non - forward solution of the bfkl equation at high energy and large momentum transfer .",
    "our main conclusion is that the lhc can experimentally check our predictions .",
    "besides , we believe that this process can be used to constrain the qcd dynamics at high energies .",
