    "homogenization protocols have been extensively studied in recent years as a powerful model for the equilibration of a quantum mechanical system interacting with a large bath  @xcite . in these schemes",
    "one considers a collision - like coupling of the system with a collection of ancillary systems that have been prepared in identical states .",
    "this corresponds to a markovian approximation in a discrete dynamical evolution .",
    "compared to typical quantum markov equations the advantage of this model is that it allows one to concentrate on the effective unitaries and completely positive maps rather than the underlying hamiltonians and lindblad generators  @xcite . by `` homogenization '' one means that the system state converges to a state that is the same as the ancilla states .",
    "this was demonstrated for a class of qudit systems in  @xcite .",
    "the bath - system entanglement was studied in  @xcite , and a continuous - time model ( quantum master equation ) was derived from the discrete model in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the emergence of irreversibility was investigated in  @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of quantum homogenization is that is as a stable method of driving a system into some fixed state , independent of its initial state . in this context",
    ", we will also refer to the bath as a `` controller '' system and its state as a `` controller state '' .",
    "hence apart from its fundamental role of studying quantum convergence , homogenization has possible applications for quantum cloning  @xcite , for the hiding of quantum information  @xcite and spin chain quantum communication  @xcite .",
    "setup of a standard homogenization protocol : the controlled system @xmath0 interact with a collection of controller systems @xmath1 which have been initialized into the same input state @xmath2 .",
    "homogenization takes place when the final state of @xmath0 is driven into the same state @xmath3 of the controllers in the limit of infinitely many couplings with the @xmath1s . ]",
    "the prototypical homogenization scenario  @xcite is described in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "it is composed of two parts : a system @xmath0 with an always on hamiltonian @xmath4 , and a large ensemble of identical controller systems @xmath5 .",
    "the latter are prepared in the same initial state @xmath2 and are assumed to have no independent free evolution .",
    "the system @xmath0 is coupled in sequential order with each one of the @xmath1s through a series of identical stepwise interactions described by the hamiltonian @xmath6 . in this setting the evolution of the system @xmath0 is described by the successive application of the completely positive ( cp ) map @xmath7   \\ ; , \\label{mappa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath9 being the time interval associated with a single @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling .",
    "after the interaction with @xmath10 controllers the state of @xmath0 becomes @xmath11 we are interested in the behavior of the sequence  ( [ seq ] ) for large @xmath10 : in the case where the system @xmath0 and the controllers @xmath12 are identical , @xmath13 and @xmath6 is a swap hamiltonian it was shown  @xcite that the state of @xmath0 asymptotically converges to the state @xmath2 of the controllers , independently from the initial state @xmath14 .    in the above",
    ", homogenization also gives rise to thermalization  @xcite - if the bath is initialized in gibbs states , then the system converges to a gibbs state .",
    "however it is an open question if this still holds in a situation where system and bath particles have different dimensionality  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in  @xcite the bath is modeled to interact with the _ whole _ system whereas an interaction with a subsystem ( such as the _ surface _ ) seems more plausible .    a first generalization towards this direction",
    "was observed by the authors of the present paper when studying the propagation of quantum information along spin chain communication channels  @xcite . in that case @xmath0 represented a collection of @xmath15 coupled qubits , while the hamiltonians @xmath6 implemented a sequence of strong instantaneous swaps among the last element of the chain and a collection of controller qubits ( the @xmath1s ) . by assuming the @xmath1s to be prepared into the spin down state @xmath16 we showed that in the limit of large @xmath10 , any initial state of @xmath0 will be coherently transferred into the @xmath1s while the chain will be mapped into the all spin down configuration @xmath17 ( the only requirement being a non trivial connection among the qubits of @xmath0 ) .",
    "generalized homogenization protocol : in this case the controlled system @xmath0 is a composite one ( e.g. a network of coupled spins ) .",
    "only a proper subset of the network interacts directly with the controllers @xmath1 ( as in the case of fig .",
    "[ setup ] , the @xmath12 are assumed to be prepared in the same initial states . ) ]    concerning ref .",
    "@xcite it is worth stressing that in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite @xmath0 and the controllers are quite distinct objects ( namely @xmath0 is a network of coupled qubits while each of the @xmath18 is just a single qubit ) .",
    "moreover only a proper subset of @xmath0 ( specifically the @xmath15-th element of the network ) interacts directly with @xmath1 : the remaining qubits are only affected by the controllers through the free hamiltonian @xmath4 of the network ( see fig .  [ figura2 ] ) .",
    "the possibility of preparing the ancilla state @xmath16 into each one of the spins of the network is therefore a remarkable feature of the system which requires some further investigation .",
    "we call it _ mediated homogenization process_.    in this paper we tackle this issue by analyzing spin networks which show similar properties . in particular in sec .",
    "[ s : heis ] we present a first example of a mediated homogenization process which allows one to transfer on the network element _ any _ input state @xmath2 of the controllers . before doing so",
    "however we introduce a general convergence criterion for relaxing channels in sec .",
    "[ mixconvex ] that will turn out to be extremely useful in our discussion .",
    "our generalized setup gives rise to much richer quantum convergence effect - in sect .",
    "[ entanglement ] we give numerical evidence for equilibrium states which are entangled . finally in sect .",
    "[ transport ] we study the effects of having competitive baths at different temperature .",
    "our starting point is the observation that what makes the cp map in eq .",
    "( [ seq ] ) converge into a specific state independently from the initial input @xmath14 is a well known property called _ relaxing _",
    "@xcite ( also referred to as `` mixing ''  @xcite or `` absorbing''@xcite ) . in this language the convergence point @xmath19 is the only _ fixed point _ of @xmath20 , i.e. the only solution of the equation @xmath21 ( we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for an detailed introduction to relaxing channels ) .",
    "therefore an homogenization procedure is associated with a relaxing channel whose fixed point @xmath3 coincides with the state of the controller .",
    "we now prove a very simple but important result .",
    "suppose that given @xmath22 we know that the map  ( [ mappa ] ) is relaxing for a specific choice of the controlled state @xmath2 .",
    "consider now the map @xmath23 which is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ mappa ] ) by replacing @xmath2 with a state @xmath24 which is a ( non trivial ) convex combination of @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 , with @xmath270,1]$ ] and @xmath28 being a generic density matrix . in this case",
    "the map @xmath29 can be expressed as a convex combination of @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath30 with the map @xmath31 as in eq .",
    "( [ mappa ] ) with @xmath2 replaced by @xmath28 .",
    "we can then use a theorem by haag  @xcite which shows that a convex combination of cp maps containing at least one relaxing channel is relaxing , to conclude that @xmath23 is relaxing  for completeness , we provide an alternative ( and much simpler ) proof of this important theorem .",
    "it is based on the fact relaxing map is equivalent to the asymptotic deformation property  @xcite .",
    "hence for all @xmath32 there is a @xmath33 such that @xmath34 $ ] indicates the trace norm of the operator @xmath35 .",
    "we write @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the cp map that contains all other terms of the expansion of @xmath38 by the non - expansiveness  @xcite of @xmath39 and the triangle inequality we obtain latexmath:[\\ ] ] which is sufficient to show that @xmath114 satisfies the invariance condition  ( [ ffind ] ) .",
    "in the previous section we found a model where independently from the initial state of @xmath0 , the final state of the network is the _ separable",
    "_ state @xmath115 .",
    "each of the @xmath15 qudits of the network has been driven into the initial state of the controllers . in this section",
    "we show that , keeping @xmath6 as in eq .",
    "( [ ddef ] ) , there are also hamiltonians @xmath4 which are capable of building entanglement among the qudits of the network .",
    "although this is no longer a homogenization protocol ( the controller state is not transferred to the controlled system ) it could have useful applications as a method of state preparation .",
    "consider for the sake of simplicity @xmath116 . in this case the swap interaction of eq .",
    "( [ hamilto ] ) corresponds ( up to a constant ) to a heisenberg coupling .",
    "a natural generalization of it is then provided by the anisotropic heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath117 where @xmath118 represents the pauli matrix of the @xmath33-th qubit of @xmath0 and where @xmath119 is the anisotropy parameter ( the isotropic coupling is obtained for @xmath120 ) .",
    "for this coupling we can use the same argument given in previous section to characterize the relaxing properties of the associated map  ( [ mappa ] ) ( in particular the factorization property of its eigenvectors depends only on the geometry of the associated graph  @xcite ) . in this case",
    "however the isotropy is lost and the hamiltonian has a preferred spatial direction associated with the @xmath121 axis which makes @xmath16 and @xmath122 special with respect to the other controller pure states .",
    "indeed we can still show that mediated homogenization takes place for input states @xmath2 which are diagonal in the computational basis , i.e. @xmath123 this follows by the fact that for such a choice eq .",
    "( [ eed1 ] ) holds independently from the value of @xmath124 . on the contrary for more general controller states",
    "mediated homogenization is lost . as an example , consider @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 . in this case",
    "haag s theorem can still be used to ensure relaxing of the map  ( [ mappa ] ) even though computing the fixed point is not simple . for such choice",
    "however we have numerically verified that the mediated homogenization does not take place in general .",
    "we evaluated the asymptotic limit of the von neumann entropy of @xmath111 , verifying that it is no longer a multiple of the von neumann entropy of the bath state . in fig .",
    "[ fxy ] we show an example for a @xmath128 chain ( @xmath129 )",
    ".    of particular interest is the case @xmath130 . in this limit @xmath131 and the relaxing property",
    "can not be established from the theorem by haag ( simply @xmath25 is not a convex combination of @xmath132 ) .",
    "nevertheless we can use numerical analysis to show that the map ( [ mappa ] ) is still relaxing  @xcite .",
    "we found that the convergence point is highly mixed .",
    "ratio @xmath133 of the `` output '' entropy @xmath134 of the convergence point and the `` input '' entropy @xmath135 of the bath state for a xx chain of length @xmath136 the controller state is as in eq .",
    "( [ example1 ] ) . for all values of @xmath137 the dynamics is relaxing  for @xmath127 this is a trivial consequence of haag theorem , for @xmath130 instead it can be directly proved by numerical means  @xcite . when @xmath138 the state becomes diagonal and the ratio converges to @xmath15 .",
    "for @xmath139 the ratio diverges as the bath state becomes pure but the convergence point remains mixed .",
    "this should be compared with the behavior of a mediated homogenization process ( e.g. the swap coupling of sec .  [",
    "s : heis ] ) where @xmath133 is always equal to @xmath15 for all @xmath137 .",
    "the parameters for the numerics are @xmath140 and @xmath141 . ]",
    "the entropy @xmath134 of the convergence point and the concurrence between the first two qubits for an anisotropic heisenberg chain of length @xmath142 as a function of the anisotropy parameter @xmath143 the bath state is given by @xmath144 the parameters for the numerics are @xmath140 and @xmath141 . ]    since this is so much different from the isotropic heisenberg model with fixed point @xmath145 it seemed natural to compute the relaxing property and convergence point of the anisotropic model for @xmath130 as a function of @xmath124 to see the transition for a @xmath128 chain ( with highly mixed convergence point ) to the heisenberg chain ( pure convergence point ) .",
    "in particular we wanted to check if there are also entangled fixed points .",
    "for this purpose we computed the concurrence between the first and second qubit of the chain ( say ) for intermediate @xmath124 ( see fig .  [ fxyd ] ) . again , for the given parameters , all examples were relaxing .",
    "we found that the convergence point is indeed entangled for some values of @xmath124 .",
    "contrary to the results in the last section , the numerical examples of convergence points observed here depend on the parameters of the model .",
    "an important open problem is to determine if there exist @xmath4 and @xmath2 that have a fixed point with interesting applications ( e.g. a cluster state ) .",
    "the many - body structure of @xmath0 presented in fig .",
    "[ figura2 ] allows us to consider more complicated procedures .",
    "for instance we can analyze _ competitive _ configurations where the dynamics of the network @xmath0 is driven by the simultaneous coupling with two independent sets of controllers ( the @xmath146 and the @xmath147 of fig .",
    "[ duo ] ) .",
    "setup of the dynamical equilibrium : here the system of fig .",
    "[ figura2 ] is coupled to two competing baths at different temperatures . ]",
    "we can then model the `` transport '' of excitations through the network by assuming the two sets to be directly coupled with distinct network elements ( say @xmath83 for @xmath1 and @xmath148 for @xmath105 ) and assuming different `` temperature '' for the two species of controllers ( say @xmath149 for the @xmath1s and @xmath150 for the @xmath105s ) .",
    "a similar situation is considered in  @xcite where in the case of a linear chain coupled through heisenberg and xx interactions the relaxing property was observed _ numerically _  @xcite . here",
    ", the convergence can be derived analytically for arbitrary chain length as a consequence of the haag theorem . to verify this",
    "it is convenient to treat @xmath1 and @xmath105 as a unique controller composed by elements @xmath151 . from the above definitions it then follows that such composite controllers are initialized in the state @xmath152 with @xmath153 being a density matrix . therefore according to the haag theorem",
    "the convergence can be verified by focusing only on the case in which @xmath1 and @xmath105 are initialized in @xmath154 . with this choice",
    "however the iterative procedure is equivalent to the `` cooling '' protocol discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and the convergence is automatically verified .",
    "deriving the exact steady state in this case is however quite complicated so we restrict to numerical analysis .",
    "again its form depends strongly on the parameters , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "probability of finding the @xmath33th qubit in the state @xmath155 for the steady state of a heisenberg spin chain of length @xmath156 .",
    "the plot includes the systems @xmath1 ( site @xmath157 ) and @xmath105 ( site @xmath158).the parameters @xmath159 and @xmath160 we give two examples with different choice of the interaction time @xmath86 . ]",
    "we have generalized the homogenization protocols to a scenario where the system is no longer a single qudit .",
    "we found that mediated homogenization still takes place on the lattice when the interaction is taken to be isotropic .",
    "anisotropic interactions on the other hand do not in general show homogenization .",
    "our numerical results are quite suggestive in this direction but are certainly not conclusive .",
    "this suggests many further studies : what is the structure of the fixed points of these systems ?",
    "how are their entropies related to the bath entropy ?",
    "what happens when the system is close to a critical point ?",
    "can we use this convergence as a way of preparing _ useful _ states such as cluster states on optical lattices ?",
    "finally we looked at transport along chains interconnecting baths at different temperature , where the haag criterion allowed us to prove the convergence to a dynamical equilibrium .",
    "we found that the temperature profile is strongly depending on the parameters of the system , such as the interaction time , and not even monotonic for some times .",
    "while at the moment these results are numerically only , it may be possible to obtain an analytic expression for the fixed point in a weak coupling limit by deriving a closed equation for the proper ansatz ( cf .",
