    "in crystalline solids in thermodynamic equilibrium , the onset of rigidity is a direct consequence of the appearance of long range positional order and the broken continuous translational symmetry .",
    "no such overarching principles are known to govern amorphous solids which are frequently out of equilibrium .",
    "for example , the onset of rigidity in athermal granular systems has been a topic of great recent interest @xcite .",
    "such studies explore the transition of a system from a state of zero rigidity ( unjammed state ) to that of a finite one ( jammed state ) @xcite . but only a few have explored further phase transitions that may exist within the jammed state of a system @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the mechanical response of a rigid but amorphous particle raft to compressive ( longitudinal ) and shear ( transverse ) stresses for varying particulate number density ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "these rafts are space - filling assemblies of athermal hydrophobic particles floating at an air - water interface and have properties common to elastic @xcite and granular @xcite solids .",
    "its mechanical response and structural reorganization reveal anomalies that are suggestive of a phase transition between two amorphous states , i.e. , a low - density ` less - rigid ' state and a high - density ` more - rigid ' state .",
    "surface tension assists hydrophobic particles which are denser than water to float on it .",
    "they deform the otherwise flat liquid surface @xcite under gravity ,   thereby generating long - range inter - particle attraction and form particulate - clusters @xcite .",
    "the individual clusters show solid like properties ,   i.e. ,   they retain their shape and have a finite rigidity .",
    "however ,   for small areal coverage , these clusters are sparsely distributed .",
    "hence , at length scales comparable to the system size the collective mechanical property of the floating clusters is governed by the intervening liquid . upon compression , i.e. , increasing the areal coverage ,   the individual clusters fuse to form a contiguous system spanning structure .",
    "the short - range inter - particle interactions depend on the surface roughness and wettability of the particles and are either attractive or repulsive @xcite .",
    "the poly - dispersity and the athermal nature of the particles make the raft amorphous .",
    "the following experimental protocol is used to prepare the space filling structure of the raft .",
    "+ ( i ) the hydrophobic ( coated with fluoropel pfc m1104v - fs from cytonix llc ) silica particles of average diameter ( @xmath1 ) are initially sprinkled on the air - water interface in a langmuir trough .",
    "these particles form disjoint particulate clusters ( see fig.[fig.1](a ) ) .",
    "this state of the system is defined as a ` patchy ' state . for data presented in this paper ,",
    "unless otherwise mentioned ,   @xmath1 = 0.5 mm ( polydispersity is 15@xmath2 and density of silica is 2500 @xmath3 ) .",
    "+ ( ii ) these clusters are then brought within the interaction distance , i.e. , capillary length ( @xmath4 ) , @xcite   by moving the motorized teflon barriers of the trough inwards .",
    "this constitutes the first compression cycle ( @xmath5 ) . as a result of this compression",
    "the disjoint clusters coalesce to form a system - spanning quasi - two dimensional raft @xcite .",
    "the inward motion of the teflon barriers is stopped just before the out - of - plane deformations ( wrinkling ) @xcite of the raft appear .",
    "the resulting homogeneous ` compressed ' state of the particle raft is shown in fig . [ fig.1](b ) .",
    "+ ( iii ) the barriers are then moved outward in the first expansion cycle ( @xmath6 ) until they detach from the raft ( see movie ` ms1.avi ' in supplementary information ) .",

    "further cycles of compression and expansion transform the system between the ` compressed ' and the ` relaxed ' states .    the number density of the particles ( @xmath0 ) between the barriers defined as ,   @xmath7 ,   where @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( = 140 mm ) are the length and width of the raft ,   respectively is chosen to be the relevant control parameter .",
    "this is guided by the literature on jamming transition @xcite .",
    "the reported measurements are made in a range below the density where folds ,   i.e. ,   out of plane distortions @xcite occur ( see movie ` ms2.avi ' in suppl .",
    "information ) . the lack of distinct features beyond the third peak in the radial density pair - correlation function ,   @xmath10 ,   in fig .",
    "[ fig.1](d ) ,   illustrates that the raft remains amorphous in both the ` compressed ' ( see fig .",

    "[ fig.1 ] ( c ) ) states .",
    "the schematic of the experimental set - up is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1b ] .",
    "the system is ` compressed ' ( or expanded ) by moving two motorized teflon barriers along @xmath11 in steps of @xmath12 .",
    "the system is sheared sinusoidally in the @xmath11-direction with a hydrophobized microscope cover - slip attached to a piezo - stage ( pi-517.3cl ) with a amplitude ( @xmath13)=0.05 mm and a frequency ( @xmath14)=20hz . a stainless - steel cantilever and a parallel plate capacitor is used to measure shear ( @xmath15 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath16 ) stresses , respectively . details of the experimental methods and the parameters used for calculating stresses are described in appendix a. additionally the system is imaged under no shear for each position of the barriers . these images",
    "are then analyzed to obtain the mean coordination number ( @xmath17 ) and to generate the voronoi diagram from which mean cell area ( @xmath18 ) is calculated .",
    "the mechanical response of this system to external stresses ( longitudinal and shear ) is described in this paper in terms of a spatially averaged effective longitudinal and shear moduli ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ,   respectively ) that are defined as : @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the shear strain ,   @xmath24 is the distance of the cantilever from the shear - launching microscope cover - slip and @xmath25 is the incremental compressive strain ,   where @xmath26 is the length of the raft in the ` relaxed ' ( compressed ) state for an compression ( expansion ) run and @xmath27 is the density corresponding to @xmath26 . both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are measured with an instrumental resolution of 1 mpa .",
    "the noise observed in the data is intrinsic to the system and is a signature of finite size effect of the system .",
    "thus the longitudinal modulus ( @xmath19 ) is calculated by numerically differentiating smoothed ( using a polynomial fit ) @xmath16 with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "we note that the elastic moduli are used here as an intuitive measure of the stress - transmission defined above @xcite .",

    "[ fig.1 ] ( a ) ) where both @xmath16 and @xmath15 are zero ,   while the expansion cycle ( @xmath6 ) starts from the ` compressed ' state ( see fig . [ fig.1 ] ( c ) ) . during the first compression ,   system - size spanning stress - bearing networks form around @xmath30 ,   marked by rapidly growing longitudinal and shear stresses .",
    "however ,   during the subsequent expansion cycle towards the relaxed state ( @xmath31 ,   as in fig .",
    "1(c ) ) ,   both @xmath16 and @xmath15 remain finite .",
    "for the subsequent cycles ( the first expansion onwards ) the observed variation of the stresses separates into two regions : region i for @xmath32 ,   where @xmath15 decreases and region ii for @xmath33 ,   where @xmath15 increases rapidly with @xmath0 ,   whereas @xmath16 increases monotonically and non - linearly with @xmath0 in both regions .",
    "the variations in the stress transmission characteristics are illustrated through the computed @xmath19 and @xmath20 ,   shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] ( a ) and ( b ) ,   respectively .",
    "the ratio ,  @xmath34 ,   shows a pronounced but inhomogeneously jagged cusp around @xmath30 ( see fig . [ fig.3](c ) ) @xcite .",
    "the transition region is broad and shown as a shaded region in the figures .",
    "the displacement field associated with the particles in response to the barrier movement is calculated by digitally cross - correlating an image corresponding to a specific @xmath0 to a later one obtained after displacing the barriers by 0.25 mm .",
    "the details of computing the displacement field is given in @xcite .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.2b ] shows the typical displacement field during the first expansion cycle .",
    "the field is inhomogeneous and exhibits a large number of complex cellular features for @xmath32 .",
    "this is reflected in the broad distribution of the probability distribution function ,   @xmath35 ,   of the argument ( @xmath36 ) associated with the displacement vectors ( @xmath37 ) ,   i.e. ,   @xmath38 @xcite shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.2b ] .",
    "however ,   for @xmath33 the field becomes homogeneous and @xmath39 narrows considerably .",
    "the spatial resolution of the above imaging method is 0.05 mm and it limits us from calculating the displacement field associated with the shear deformation .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the displacement field at low densities ( @xmath40 ) arise from mechanical instabilities which can be interpreted as plastic events at the scale of the particle size ( see movie ` ms3.avi ' and fig .",

    "[ fig.2c ] ( a ) for the second compression ( c2 ) cycle .",
    "the jaggedness of the graph , i.e. , sudden jumps in @xmath41 s , is associated with plasticity .",
    "a measure of the total number of plastic events associated with the stress cycling is obtained from the hysteresis of the cumulative strain parameter @xmath42 , where the summation is carried out over all the particles .",
    "figure [ fig.2c](b ) shows the variation of @xmath43 with @xmath16 for successive compression ( open symbols ) and expansion ( filled symbols ) cycles .",
    "the images of the raft at various @xmath0 s are used to further explore possible structural signatures of the transition .",
    "figure [ fig.3c ] ( a ) shows an increase in the mean coordination number @xmath17 ( @xmath44 ) ,   where @xmath45 is chosen to match the first peak in @xmath10 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding variation of the voronoi cell area @xmath18 normalized with the particle area ( @xmath46 ) , an alternative measure of the local structure and compactivity @xcite , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig.3c ] ( b ) .",
    "both @xmath17 and @xmath47 varies linearly with @xmath0 in region i , but however start to deviate from the initial slope ( shown by the extrapolated dotted line ) in the transition region .",
    "it suggests that the measured weakening of the shear modulus is accompanied by structural reorganizations at the length scale of nearest neighbors throughout the system .",
    "the choice of an order parameter in a disordered system is usually not unique and is often subjective @xcite . in our experiments",
    "we find the mean coordination number @xmath17 is a sensitive parameter to describe the transition .",
    "the dependence of @xmath19 and @xmath20 on @xmath17 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] ( a ) and ( b ) respectively for @xmath6 and @xmath48 . the system exhibits two terminal states ,   ( i ) ` less - rigid ' state ( @xmath49pa and @xmath50 pa ) and ( ii ) a ` more - rigid ' state ( @xmath51pa and @xmath52pa ) . the transition from one state to the other is marked by decrease in @xmath20 around @xmath53 ,   although ,   @xmath19 changes monotonically with increasing @xmath17 .",
    "hence , the anomaly observed is in the variation of the shear compliance , i.e. , @xmath54 , reminiscent of the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility at a spin glass transition in disordered magnets @xcite .",
    "the cusp in @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] ( c ) ) is a robust feature of this transition .",
    "this is a signature of the difference in the density dependence of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ,   reminiscent of , but distinct from ,   the power - law divergence observed in simulations of the jamming transition in frictionless granular materials @xcite .",
    "however ,   one must emphasize that the phenomenology observed here is far from the original definition of athermal jamming for which only hard core interaction is considered and where the transition is between rigid and non - rigid states .",
    "in the conventional sense the relaxed state of the system is already in a jammed state .",
    "the observations should be viewed as a transition between two jammed states whose differences are discussed below .      in order to understand the microscopic mechanism associated with the transition",
    ",   we investigated the dependence of @xmath20 on the particle size ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] ( b ) ) . for the ` less - rigid ' state ( filled triangles ) ,   @xmath55 .",
    "this is consistent with a capillary bridging mechanism ( @xmath56 ,   where @xmath57 is the surface tension of the liquid ) through the pinned contact lines of the liquid on the particles @xcite . in the ` more - rigid ' state the contact friction dominates the inter - particle interaction .",
    "the measured shear modulus ( @xmath20 ) scales with the number density of contacts ,   which is proportional to the number density of particles ,   i.e. ,   @xmath58 .",
    "it assumes that the roughness scale is independent of the particle size .",
    "since this happens over a narrow range of @xmath0 ,   one obtains @xmath59 as in conventional elasticity in a quasi-2d system @xcite .",
    "we hence conclude that regions i and ii represent a capillary - bridged solid and a frictional solid ,   respectively .",
    "the structural relaxation time of the particle raft ,   @xmath60 ,   where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the mass and velocity of a single particle respectively and @xmath63 is the viscosity of the liquid . in calculating the relaxation time ,   we assume that the effective temperature of the system ( @xmath64 ) is related to the kinetic energy of the particle ,   i.e. ,   @xmath65 ,   where @xmath66 is the boltzmann s constant .",
    "the system thus takes a long time to reach its equilibrium state .",
    "this would mean that the system would typically find itself in a kinetically arrested state and would show a dependence on the history of the paths via which a given state of the system is reached .",
    "indeed , measurements above 1 mhz probes a frequency - dependent rigidity of the material as shown in fig . [ fig.5](a ) for @xmath67 .",
    "moreover ,   creep effects ( time - dependence ) in @xmath15 are more pronounced in region ii than in region i ,   as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] ( b ) .",
    "interestingly ,   the stress allows the ` more - rigid ' frictional solid to explore various metastable states and hence the system shows a marked ` creep ' ,   i.e. a temporal variation ,   in @xmath15 .",
    "this is absent for the ` less - rigid ' capillary solid suggesting that it is closer to a deeper metastable minimum .",
    "strong history dependence is also seen in the variation of @xmath16 and @xmath15 measured for subsequent compression and expansion cycles which broadly follow the trend ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.2a ] ) but with greatly reduced hysteresis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.hyst ] , the data shown in the figure is for particles whose diameter is 1 mm ) ,   analogous to residual densification observed in amorphous materials @xcite .",
    "we have shown that a rigid particle raft can undergo a phase transition from a ` less - rigid ' low density state to a ` more - rigid ' high density state as a function of particulate number density .",
    "the transition is marked by a weakening of the shear modulus .",
    "the measured shear modulus which distinguishes the two states of the system ,   i.e. ,   ` less - rigid ' and ` more - rigid ' ,   arises from the restoring force of pinned contact lines in the former case and from particle contacts through a frictional coupling in the latter .",
    "the weakening of the shear modulus observed in the crossover region is thus attributable to a reduction of restoring force arising from plastic events caused by the mechanical instabilities and the associated depinning of the contact lines @xcite .",
    "although the results presented in the present paper are specific to particle rafts ,   the weakening of the shear response and local reorganization seen in the present experiment ,   have also been observed in network glasses @xcite .",
