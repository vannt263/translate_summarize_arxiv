    "it thus appears necessary to formulate the perturbation problem in a more general way than by the stewart - walker definition .",

    "a gauge transformation of the type ( [ omtr ] ) amounts to selecting a congruence of principal null curves .",

    "he fails to achieve this goal for modes with certain ` algebraically special ' frequencies .",
    "note that one should proceed with caution when using the results of this paper .",
    "for example , on p. 1457 , one finds this claim : ` _ _ i.e. _ _ , we obtain the linearized version of the goldberg - sachs theorem ' . now the goldberg - sachs theorem has been shown not to hold in the linearized theory @xcite .",
    "chandrasekhar further investigates the properties of algebraically special perturbations @xcite .",
    "he concludes his work with several , apparently technical , but at any rate , unanswered questions .",
    "these concern the relation of the starobinsky operator to complex conjugation , and to the special forms of the potential barriers occurring .",
