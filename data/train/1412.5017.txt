    "_ colloquium _ , we first summarize the essential ideas underlying the random first order transition theory ( rfot ) of the glass transition @xcite . the rfot theory , a phrase that was first introduced in @xcite , has previously been used to understand both the structural glass transition @xcite as well as various types of spin glass transitions without inversion symmetry @xcite .",
    "the overarching goal of this work is not to review the current status of theories for glass physics but is to illustrate how the ideas that underlie the rfot can be used to discuss glassy aspects or features that are manifested in both biological and condensed matter systems .",
    "these applications are meant to show case the wide ranging use of ideas that were generated in the physics of the sgt . for lack of space",
    "we do not discuss potential connections between the rfot theory and other interesting subjects such as turbulence @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of glasses is well documented .",
    "most liquids , when undercooled rapidly ( 0.1 - 100 k / min in the laboratory ) , become extraordinarily viscous ( fig .",
    "[ glassesgeneralfig1]a ) over a narrow temperature range . the laboratory glass temperature , @xmath0 ,",
    "is experimentally defined when the shear viscosity @xmath1 poise @xcite , which is about fifteen orders of magnitude larger than the viscosity of pure water at room temperature . at @xmath2",
    "the relaxation time becomes so large that thermal equilibrium is not reached in cooling experiments .",
    "the dramatic increase in @xmath3 is not accompanied by discernible changes in the structure .",
    "the temperature - dependent relaxation time scale , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , is typically super - arrhenius , and can be fit using the vogel - fulcher - tamman ( vft ) equation , @xmath6 \\label{vft}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a microscopic relaxation time , the parameter @xmath8 is referred to as the fragility index , and @xmath9 is a putative ideal glass transition temperature that is obtained by extrapolating measured viscosity data to inaccessible temperatures .",
    "typically @xmath10-relaxation , a terminology borrowed from the literature in polymer glasses , refers to motion on length scales larger than the molecular size of the particles .",
    "an example of such a fit for salol is given in fig.[glassesgeneralfig1]c .",
    "the viscosity data have been fit using other forms @xcite but here we will assume that eq.([vft ] ) provides a good description , which indeed is the case for a number of glass forming materials . as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ glassesgeneralfig1]b , for many systems the intermediate scattering function exhibits a plateau after the initial decay before decaying further on the @xmath10-relaxation time .",
    "the duration of the plateau in regime b ( fig . [ glassesgeneralfig1]b ) increases as the degree of supercooling increases .",
    "in addition , the glassy phase is dynamically heterogeneous - a notion that has received considerable attention , and here we argue that this concept , arising naturally from the rfot , is of great generality .",
    "we do not delve into other interesting aberrations in supercooled liquids , such as the break down of stokes - einstein relation noted in computer simulations @xcite and in experiments because they are not relevant to the main themes of this colloquium .",
    "configurational entropy is a key concept in many theories of the glass transition . to define it , consider a free energy functional @xmath11 which depends on number density , @xmath12 , and a temperature , @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that at sufficiently low temperatures @xmath11 has many minima ( that is , the number of minima goes to infinity with the system volume , @xmath14 ) .",
    "these states are labelled by an index @xmath15 such that to each valley we associate a free energy @xmath16 and a free energy density @xmath17 .",
    "the number of free energy minima with free energy density @xmath18 is assumed to be exponentially large : @xmath19\\ ] ] where the function @xmath20 is the configurational entropy or complexity .",
    "physically , it is the entropy arising from an assumed exponentially large number of locally stable configurations .",
    "the concept of configurational entropy also plays a central role in experimental glassy physics , especially in the formulation and analysis of the so - called kauzmann paradox @xcite , which follows from the following arguments .",
    "below the melting temperature , @xmath21 , the heat capacity @xmath22 of a supercooled liquid is larger than that of the corresponding crystal . as a result of this excess heat capacity ,",
    "the entropy of the supercooled liquid state is larger than that of the crystal .",
    "however , the supercooled liquid state entropy is decreasing faster than the crystal entropy .",
    "these observations are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ kauzmann ] and leads to the paradox .",
    "if the entropy difference is extrapolated to temperatures below the laboratory glass temperature , @xmath0 , it vanishes at some nonzero temperature called @xmath23 , after kauzmann . in his original article kauzmann",
    "@xcite suggested that the improbable decrease of the entropy of the liquid below that of the crystal phase could be avoided if the barrier to nucleation vanished somewhere between @xmath0 and @xmath23 .",
    "extensive analysis @xcite shows that the crystallization rate slows down more rapidly than the relaxation rate so that kauzmann s paradox is not realized .",
    "one alternative to kauzmann s suggestion is that a very slowly cooled liquid would continue to lose entropy until , as it approaches the crystal value , an equilibrium phase transition occurs .",
    "the nature and the very existence of such a transition has been much debated .",
    "importantly , the extrapolated @xmath23 is always close to the fitted @xmath9 in eq.([vft ] ) @xcite .",
    "the adams - gibbs ( ag ) @xcite theory of the glass transition as well as the rfot theory ( below @xmath24 indicated in fig .",
    "[ kauzmann ] ) focus on the configurational entropy as defined above .",
    "the idea is as follows .",
    "physically , it is reasonable to assume that that the vibrational part of any amorphous state entropy should be more or less equal to the crystal state vibrational entropy .",
    "the excess entropy of the liquid state is then attributed to the configurational entropy , @xmath20 .",
    "the equilibrium phase transition would occur at @xmath25 when @xmath20 vanishes . in this picture",
    ", we expect @xmath23 to equal @xmath9 because slow transport below @xmath24 is intimately related to loss in @xmath20 .",
    "these ideas will be developed in detail below .",
    "finally , we remark that both ag and rfot theories lead to the vft law , eq.([vft ] ) , via the ag relation , @xmath26\\label{ag}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 , vanishing at @xmath23 which is identified as @xmath9 , and @xmath28 a positive constant . however , the derivations of eq.([ag ] ) in the two theories are very different . in the ag theory",
    "it is concluded that there is a divergent length scale , @xmath29 while in rfot the length scale is @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is derived and discussed further below .",
    "the ag correlation length exponent @xmath32 is in general not consistent with numerous simulations @xcite to measure correlations in glassy liquids , nor is it consistent with the expected inequality @xmath33 @xcite .      in an attempt to provide a theory to account for the nature of the sgt ,",
    "a framework was developed in the late 1980s , which was initially inspired by analogies to exotic ( explained further below ) spin glass models i.e , those without inversion symmetry @xcite .",
    "from general physical considerations it is logical that there ought to be similarities between structural glasses and spin glasses .",
    "a glass , after all , can be thought as a frozen liquid or more precisely flows on time scales that vastly exceed observational time scale ( fig .",
    "[ glassesgeneralfig1 ] ) . in both cases",
    "there is no obvious long range order .",
    "it is only when the systems evolve in time that there are obvious differences . in a liquid",
    "a particle can diffuse arbitrarily far away from the initial position as @xmath34 , whereas it would be localized in a small region in space in a glass on the observation time scale , @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ glassesgeneralfig1](d ) ) .",
    "similarly , a spin glass may be thought of as a frozen paramagnet with no long range the magnetic order @xcite .",
    "when the system develops in time the local magnetic moment points in a specific average direction ( a spin at a given time remains correlated with itself at a later time ) in the spin glass phase , whereas in the paramagnetic the spin direction averages to zero resulting in the vanishing of local magnetic moment . in both cases",
    ", it is only through time evolution can the two phases be distinguished , a concept that will play an important role in our discussion of dynamic heterogeneity .    despite the compelling analogy between the structural and spin glasses",
    "there are also important conceptual differences between the two .",
    "first , in sg disorder is quenched @xcite . in ising spin glasses the magnetic moments of mn in an alloy with ni",
    "are permanently frozen . on the other hand , in the sgt problem",
    "the randomness is self - generated @xcite as the material is cooled below the melting temperature .",
    "second , there is considerable numerical and experimental evidence for an equilibrium phase transition in three dimensions in ising spin glasses @xcite . in the sgt case a thermodynamic transition at @xmath36 , characterized by a vanishing of configurational entropy ,",
    "is not universally accepted despite considerable experimental and theoretical support .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the ising spin glass does not exhibit unusual slowing down in the relaxation times as a liquid that undergoes a transition to a supercooled state .",
    "therefore , an analogy to spin glasses is insightful only if inversion symmetry is not satisfied as is the case in @xmath37-spin glass models with @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "indeed , for such models , we that the mathematical structure of the dynamical equation describing the relaxation of spin - spin correlation for @xmath39-spin glass model is identical @xcite to the mode coupling theory of the density - density relaxation @xcite .",
    "this discovery and subsequent studies linking dynamics and thermodynamics in these exotic mean - field spin glass models to models in which randomness is self - generated lead to the complete formulation of the rfot @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the random energy model @xcite , which does not have a dynamical transition at high temperature , is a special case of p - spin glass model with @xmath40 exhibiting one step replica symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "a valid criticism in using exotic spin glass models to obtain insights into the sgt is that in the former quenched disorder is explicitly modeled in the hamiltonian whereas in the sgt it is self - generated and manifests itself in the glassy phase .",
    "( because glasses are formed from molecules , whose dynamics ( assuming quantum effects are not important ) at the microscopic level is newtonian or brownian , the information about the self - generated randomness is implicit in the trajectories . ) in what we consider , especially in retrospective , to be an important paper @xcite , it was shown that the major conclusions drawn based on spin - glass models can be obtained using a model hamiltonian with short range local order , incorporated using static structure factor , without any need for explicitly modeling quenched disorder .",
    "we clarified that the generic ideas within rfot and related theories that produce a profound connection between static and dynamic description , solely depends on the emergence of an exponential number of metastable states at a dynamical transition temperature , @xmath41 , which is well above @xmath0 , the laboratory glass transition temperature .",
    "moreover , the theory further established that at the so - called temperature kauzmann temperature , @xmath23 , the entropy associated with the metastable state vanishes resulting in divergence of viscosity eq.([vft ] ) .",
    "thus , within rfot @xmath42 , an observation that accords well with many glass forming materials @xcite .",
    "the body of works created in the late 1980s was subsequently put on firmer foundations by others @xcite",
    ". there has also been much discussion about the sense in which the mode coupling theory is a proper mean field theory @xcite very recently @xcite all aspects of the rfot have been illustrated in an exact description of a hard sphere fluid in the limit of high dimensions .",
    "we believe these are illuminating studies because they provide a microscopic basis for understanding rfot theory of the transition of the sgt , which can not be unequivocally stated for other theories of supercooled liquids and glasses .      despite the successes of the rfot theory of the sgt ,",
    "some worrying aspects have been raised @xcite , which apparently require further scrutiny . before addressing these issues briefly ,",
    "it is worth reminding the readers that although the rfot theory provides a unified description of both the dynamical transition and the expected thermodynamic transition precipitated by the vanishing of the configurational entropy @xcite much of the focus has been on the dynamics below @xmath24 .",
    "this is a pity because rfot theory seamlessly integrates the dynamics above and below @xmath24 . with this in mind",
    "we address the difficulties raised in @xcite associated with rfot .",
    "the first is related to the notion of surface tension between two mosaic states , a concept that is relevant below @xmath24 . as we show below , the crucial element in producing the vft equation with the vanishing of configurational entropy at @xmath25 is that the free energy barriers between mosaic states scale as @xmath43 where @xmath44 diverges at @xmath25 ( see below ) .",
    "this implies that there is really no interface between two statistical similar glassy states .",
    "rather , to go from one state to another , roughly @xmath45 of the @xmath46 particles in a correlated volume must be rearranged .",
    "consequently , it is our opinion that the issues raised about the surface tension within rfot merely obfuscates the physics of the activated transitions below @xmath24 .",
    "the second point is based on the idea that the free energy barriers might depend on the infinite frequency shear modulus , @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "such a postulate has no microscopic basis , which relies on the dubious relation that @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we feel that the dyre model can not be compared with rfot on the same footing . finally , it has been asserted in @xcite that the crossover between the liquid like diffusion at @xmath49 and the activated transitions below @xmath24 is not only poorly understood but also is without experimental support .",
    "this is most certainly not the case as detailed elsewhere @xcite . indeed , unlike the existence of the ideal glass transition temperature , there is much data establishing a change in the dynamics at a temperature far above @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , early computer simulations have unequivocally established a change in the nature of transport near @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "more importantly , using a detailed analysis of experimental data it has been shown @xcite that not only is there ample evidence for the crossover temperature but also the dynamics leading to the crossover may be semi - universal ( see below ) .",
    "we conclude that both experiments and simulations have provided compelling evidence for the existence and importance of @xmath24 . in our view",
    "the crucial missing point in full support of rfot is the clear demonstration of the divergent correlation length @xmath31 at @xmath25 , which was discussed briefly in section i.b and in more detail below .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the basic features of the rfot as applied to the structural glass transition problem .",
    "the important physical aspects of the glass transition and the glassy state that are incapsulated in rfot @xcite are based on two key ideas .",
    "first , the glassy state is essentially a frozen liquid with elastic properties . to describe a glassy state",
    "we imagine an order parameter ( op ) description in terms of frozen density fluctuations , @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath51 is the statistical mechanical average local number density and @xmath52 is the spatially averaged density which is identical to the liquid state density at the same temperature and pressure . in what follows",
    ", we will take into account that there can be many glassy states so that @xmath51 will have a state label , @xmath53 .",
    "other order parameters can be imagined , but frozen density fluctuations are the simplest and are directly related to the most obvious characteristic of a solid : elastic properties and a non - zero debye - waller factor . because the glassy phase is amorphous or has random characteristics , the frozen density op is specified by a functional probability measure @xmath54 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the first two moments of this measure are , @xmath55\\delta n(\\mathrm{\\mathbf{x})}\\label{eq : average density fluctuation}\\ ] ]    @xmath56^{2}}=\\int dp[\\delta n][\\delta n(\\mathbf{x})]^{2}.\\label{eq : order parameter}\\ ] ]    note that because @xmath57 the density itself can not be a proper order parameter for the glass transition . in order to capture the essence of the glassy state , something analogous to @xmath58",
    "must be used @xcite .    at the sgt transition",
    "the op will be discontinuous .",
    "there are two arguments leading to this conclusion .",
    "first , any landau or lgw type theory for the density @xmath51 will not have a @xmath59 symmetry , and therefore a landau type theory will lead to some sort of discontinuous transition .",
    "more formally , the glassy state is one with a broken translational symmetry , ( since it is randomly nonuniform ) , with elastic properties @xcite . because of this broken translational symmetry it is impossible to go continuously from a liquid state with time average translational invariance to a glassy state .",
    "the second argument imagines that for a given glassy state , the frozen density can be written as @xcite , @xmath60}\\ ] ] where the @xmath61 are the ( random or amorphous ) average positions of the particles making up the glassy state and @xmath62 is the average fluctuation of their positions . in the glassy state",
    "this is a finite quantity , on the order of a particle diameter , and it determines the debye - waller factor and the elastic coefficients of the glass . in a liquid",
    "it grows with time and is proportional to the self - diffusion coefficient ( fig .",
    "as the glassy state is approached from the liquid side , it initially grows , but then plateaus on the scale of a molecular diameter .",
    "the plateauing of this mean - squared - displacement means that the broken translational symmetry of the glassy state will occur discontinuously . as mentioned earlier",
    ", the use of density as an order parameter @xcite differs conceptually from the ideas of rfot theory . in the description of the amorphous state",
    "using the density functional theory of the liquid to crystal transition @xcite density itself changes discontinuously near the putative glass transition density for hard sphere systems , whereas in rfot theory it is the analogue of the edwards - anderson order parameter eq.([eq : order parameter ] ) , which jumps discontinuously at the ideal glass transition temperature .",
    "the second key idea in the formulation of rfot is that in general one expects a very large number of distinct metastable glassy states @xcite .",
    "if the number is large enough this in turn leads to two distinct transitions .",
    "this is indeed what happens in a many of exactly soluble mean field spin models @xcite , in exact high dimensional fluid models @xcite , and in mean - field approximations for a variety of liquid state models @xcite . in all of these cases",
    "the following scenario is realized .",
    "denote a particular glass state by the label @xmath10 , with the frozen density in that state given by @xmath63 and the free energy in that state equal to @xmath64 .",
    "below a temperature denoted by @xmath41 ( the @xmath28 here stands for dynamical , cf .",
    "below ) , there are an extensive number for a @xmath46particle system with @xmath65 a constant for large @xmath46 . ] of statistically similar states incongruent states ( basically uncorrelated ) that have zero overlap @xcite : @xmath66 in rfot",
    "it is assumed that these features are also realized in realistic structural glass systems with the only caveat that there is no strict dynamical transition at @xmath24 .",
    "rather , the transition at @xmath24 is avoided but the dynamics changes around @xmath24 signaling the importance of activated transitions .",
    "because the states are statistically similar one can not simply use an external field to pick out a particular state . the canonical free energy , @xmath67 , is given by the partition function via @xmath68=tr\\exp[-\\beta h]=\\sum_{\\alpha}\\exp[-\\beta f_{\\alpha}].\\ ] ] in the glassy context there are two important cases when @xmath67 is not the physical free energy .",
    "first , if the barrier between the states is actually infinite then @xmath67 is not a physically meaningful free energy .",
    "second , if the barriers are finite but the experimental time scale is too short for fluctuations to probe the various states , then it is also not a physical free energy .",
    "a component averaged free energy can be defined by @xcite @xmath69 with @xmath70 the probability to be in the state @xmath10 , @xmath71.\\ ] ] the two free energies , @xmath67 and @xmath72 , are related by @xmath73 here @xmath20 , is the configurational entropy ( sometimes called the complexity or state entropy ) , introduced in section i.b .",
    "in general @xmath20 is related to the solution degeneracy and is extensive ( and @xmath74 ) if there are an exponentially large number of states .",
    "note that in infinite range models with a rfot and a nonzero @xmath20 the physical free energy is @xmath72 because the @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : canonical free energy ] ) is an entropy term which is a measure of parts of state space not probed in a finite amount of time . since a physical entropy",
    "should only be associated with accessible configurations it follows that @xmath67 is not a physically meaningful free energy .",
    "the scenario for the two transitions in the rfot theory can be described as follows . for @xmath75 transport",
    "is largely not collective , and the topology of state space is unremarkable .",
    "however , for @xmath76 the dynamics slows down and the system gets stuck in a glassy metastable state . for @xmath77 , there are an extensive number of statistically similar , incongruent globally glassy metastable states . if activated transport is neglected these states are infinitely long lived .",
    "the liquid state free energy , @xmath78 is lower than the physical glassy state free energy , @xmath72 , but it is equal to the canonical free energy , @xmath67 . because there are so many glassy states , a liquid with probability one will be stuck in one of the metastable glassy states for @xmath77 . in the absence of activated transport it will remain in that state forever . for infinite range models with an rfot , exact dynamical calculations shows a continuous slowing down and freezing as @xmath79 .",
    "the same result is also found for some approximate , mean - field like , calculations of dynamics in realistic liquid state models .",
    "the transition at @xmath41 is also closely related to the so - called mode coupling theory of the glass transition .",
    "in realistic systems , activated transport does take place , and hence on the longest time scales for , @xmath77 , the dynamics are very sluggish .",
    "for this reason @xmath41 is called a dynamical transition : it is a sharp transition only in infinite range models , but in general it sets a temperature region where the dynamics becomes glassy like .",
    "in addition , for @xmath77 dynamic heterogeneity ( dh ) plays an increasing important role .",
    "this too , can be explained as arising from the multiplicity of states , as we show below .",
    "the driving force for the activated transport in the rfot scenario for @xmath77 is entropic and is given by the state or configurational entropy . at a lower temperature denoted by @xmath23 , after the so - called kauzmann temperature",
    ", the configurational entropy vanishes as does activated transport . in other words , there is a second transition at @xmath23 which is the ideal or equilibrium glass transition temperature . for hard sphere systems for which the volume fraction ( @xmath80 ) is the relevant variable the analogues of the two transitions and emergence of other phases as @xmath80 is increased is schematically shown in fig.([francesco1fig2 ] ) .",
    "the dynamical transition is characterized by the order parameter , @xmath81 above @xmath41 this correlation function for fixed @xmath82 decays as @xmath34 but as @xmath79 its decay gets slower and slower in a power law fashion .",
    "the spatial fourier transform of this quantity is the intermediate scattering function , @xmath83 with @xmath84 here @xmath85 is the position of particle @xmath86 at time @xmath87 and @xmath14 is the system volume .    we illustrate the dynamical behavior of @xmath88 in fig .",
    "( [ kangfig3]a ) as a function of @xmath87 for a wavenumber equal to the first peak in the static structure factor , @xmath89 .",
    "the data are taken from @xcite a brownian dynamics simulation of a binary mixture of highly charged spherical colloidal particles , a system that becomes a wigner glass @xcite when the fraction of colloidal particles , @xmath80 , increases beyond @xmath90 the analogue of @xmath41 . in the rfot description of this system",
    ", there is a dynamical transition packing fraction , @xmath90 , as well as an ideal glass transition value , @xmath91 , with @xmath92 . because of equilibration problems",
    ", the simulations are restricted to @xmath80 values just past a packing fraction interpreted as @xmath90 because it exhibits all the characteristics of the dynamical transition density for colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "the plots show that in the liquid phase @xmath93 decays for long times , but as the dynamical transition is approached the system becomes sluggish and @xmath93 plateaus for longer and longer times .",
    "a fundamental quantity of interest is , @xmath94 at @xmath41 , @xmath95 no longer decays , except ( in non - mean - field models ) on the longest times scales .",
    "effectively , it becomes the edwards - anderson order parameter for the glass transition : @xmath96 in rfot this dynamical order parameter is identical to the equilibrium @xmath58 given by eq.([eq : order parameter ] ) .",
    "in other words , equilibrium - like theories are in accord with dynamical theories .    because the op involves the square of the density fluctuations it is clear that the associated susceptibility will be something like , @xmath97",
    "indeed , in @xcite the analog of this quantity was shown to be the relevant susceptibility at a spin glass transition in the rfot universality class .",
    "also of interest is the spatial and time fourier transform of @xmath98 , @xmath99\\chi_{op}(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y},t)\\ ] ] a related susceptibility.$ ] for long times this becomes the wavenumber integral of @xmath100 . ]",
    "that is easily measured in simulations has also been defined , @xmath101.\\label{eq : chi-4}\\ ] ] in fig.([kangfig3]b ) we show simulation results for this quantity for the same @xcite wigner glass as the dynamical transition is approached . in general",
    ", one finds that the location of the maximum and its amplitude grows as the dynamical transition is approached .",
    "this correlation function will be further discussed in section iii .",
    "the static susceptibility for the glass transition at @xmath41 is @xcite @xmath102 as @xmath103 , the homogeneous susceptibility , @xmath104 , in a mean - field theory , diverges as @xcite , @xmath105 at finite and small wavenumber , on the other hand , @xmath106 with @xmath107 a microscopic ( correlation ) length .",
    "this defines a divergent length scale as @xmath79 given by @xcite , @xmath108 this is the same divergence found at a mean - field spinoidol point .",
    "it is worth emphasizing again that all of these so - called dynamical results , also follow from the equilibrium theory of the rfot .",
    "it is important to note that they are mean field results for a phase transition that is avoided in realistic systems .",
    "thus , the predicted exponents are effective exponents .",
    "although there is considerable debate about the existence of @xmath109 there is compelling evidence that the very nature of transport in liquids changes at @xmath110 .",
    "in an insightful paper , goldstein argued forty five years ago that the crossover from liquid like dynamics to transport that involves overcoming free energy barriers @xcite occurs at temperatures that far exceed @xmath2 .",
    "he predicted that barrier crossing events start to become important as soon the relaxation time exceeds 10@xmath111s .",
    "more recently , by analyzing experimental data of a number of glass forming materials it has been shown that the crossover time is approximately @xmath11210@xmath113s @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it was noted that @xmath114 might be semi - universal .",
    "the material - dependent ratio @xmath115 ranges from 1.1 - 1.7 ( see table 1 in @xcite ) . as we already pointed out multiple times",
    ", @xmath24 roughly corresponds to the temperature predicted by the mct with the caveat that at @xmath24 the power law singularity describing the dependence of the relaxation time on temperature is avoided in glass forming materials .",
    "these crucial studies demonstrate the relevance of @xmath24 in systems without quenched disorder , which invalidate the strict claims made based on the @xmath116-spin glass model in finite dimensions @xcite .      to a limited extent fluctuations about the rfot for the sgt",
    "have been considered . from our viewpoint",
    "the most important aspect of this work has been the establishment of the connection between the sgt problem and the random magnetic field one @xcite .    the crucial physical point to see this connection ,",
    "is to realize that for @xmath77 ergodicity is broken on all but the longest time scales .",

    "it is even more difficult to show @xmath380 in computer simulations although the plausibility of a thermodynamic transition envisioned in rfot has been hinted at using random pinning simulations @xcite .    despite these reservations in three key papers @xcite[see also @xcite ] ,",
    "have studied in detail the thermodynamics of hard sphere particles in large dimensions ( @xmath381 ) and all of the predictions of rfot have been exactly demonstrated . by exploiting the observation that in this system at @xmath381 only the second virial coefficient contributes to the free energy functional of the system it was shown that the one step replica symmetry breaking ( 1rsb ) and the two transitions ( with the variable being density as opposed to temperature ) scenario , as anticipated in the rfot theory @xcite , is valid . in addition , they discovered an instability of the 1rsb at high density resulting in the gardner transition .",
    "it is generally believed that an inherently mean field description is reasonable for liquids ( except close to gas - liquid critical point ) , and hence the large dimensional theory may have wider range of applicability ( see , for example @xcite .",
    "we have barely touched on the potential application of glass transition concepts in biological problems .",
    "one noteworthy example is the folding of chromosomes , which could result in manifestation of metastability and glass - like behavior due to topological constraints @xcite . in eukaryotic cells chromosomes fold into globules occupying well - defined regions referred to as chromosome territories @xcite , thus bringing widely separated gene - rich regions",
    "are brought into close proximity .",
    "folding of chromosomes apparently occurs without forming knots , which is important for gene activity , in a polymer containing many mega base pairs . using constraints derived from experiments as a guide @xcite",
    "it has been argued that the genome is packaged into fractal globules @xcite differing qualitatively from equilibrium globules in which formation would occur with high probability .",
    "it is most likely the case that there are multiple states associated with fractal globules , which implies that the dynamics of chromosome folding would be glassy .",
    "although the biological implications are unclear , it is worth exploring genome folding in various eukaryotic cells to assess if glass like behavior is exhibited , and to understand if nature utilizes such dynamics in of the most crucial functions .",
    "there is an enormous amount of glassy phenomena that occur in the so - called hard condensed matter physics systems .",
    "generally these are quantum systems at low temperatures .",
    "they include coulomb glasses , disordered insulators , disordered metals , quantum phase transitions from a superconducting state to either a disordered insulator or metal , various non - fermi liquid systems , quantum griffith s phase effects , etc .",
    "even in low temperature ferromagnetic metals there are numerous manifestations of glassy effects @xcite .",
    "one of the main problems is that there is not a common language , let alone a common description , in these various subfields .",
    "it is possible that some of the recent unifying ideas in classical glassy systems will be relevant in these quantum systems .",
    "for example , in the sgt problem there has been a tremendous amount of work recently on dynamic heterogeneity .",
    "there has been a fruitful interplay between theory , simulations and experiments .",
    "this concept is also clearly relevant in biological glassy systems , as illustrated here .",
    "recently , it has been shown that single molecule pulling experiments on proteins and dna provide direct evidence for heterogeneity on the molecular scale @xcite . in the condensed matter case",
    "this subject has hardly been touched @xcite . in understanding the similarities and differences between classical and quantum glassiness two fundamental differences must be kept in mind .",
    "the first is that quenched disorder is perfectly correlated along the imaginary time direction and this can have especially profound implications for quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "if the disorder is self - generated as in the case of the sgt , it is likely that similar profound effects will occur .",
    "the second is that in general there are modes that are soft only at @xmath382 , and these extra soft modes @xcite will likely play an important role in the long time glassy dynamics .",
