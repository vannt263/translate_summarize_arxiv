    "( [ spkswa ] ) includes the new results from belle @xcite , @xmath8 , and babar @xcite , @xmath9 , and previous results from opal , aleph and cdf . )    in addition , cp asymmetries in many other modes ( neutral @xmath10 decays into final cp eigenstates and non - cp eigenstates and charged @xmath10 decays ) have been searched for .",
    "we describe the implications of the new data for our theoretical understanding of cp violation .",
    "within the standard model , the only source of cp violation is the kobayashi - maskawa ( km ) phase @xcite .",
    "this phase appears in the ckm matrix which describes the charged current interactions of quarks .",
    "the ckm matrix gives the couplings of the @xmath11-boson to @xmath12 quark pairs : @xmath13 the unitarity of the matrix leads to various relations among its elements , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath14 the _ unitarity triangle _ is a geometrical presentation in the complex plane of the relation ( [ unirel ] ) .",
    "it provides a convenient tool in the study of flavor physics and cp violation : 1 .",
    "flavor changing processes and unitarity give rather precise information on the magnitudes of all elements except for @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which have large uncertainties .",
    "the unitarity triangle is a pictorial way of combining the various constraints on these elements and of testing whether the constraints can be explained consistently within the ckm framework .",
    "the angles of the triangle are related to cp violation . in particular , measurements of various cp asymmetries in @xmath10 decays can be used to constrain the values of these angles .",
    "conversely , the consistency of the various constraints tests whether cp violation can be accounted for by the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism . since the length of one side , @xmath17 , is well known , it is convenient to re - scale the unitarity triangle by the length of this side and put it on the real axis .",
    "when doing so , the coordinates of the remaining vertex correspond to the @xmath18 and @xmath19 parameters in the wolfenstein parametrization @xcite of the ckm matrix ( or , in an improved version @xcite , to @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) : @xmath22        the angles @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( also known as , respectively , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) are defined as follows : @xmath27 the lengths @xmath28 and @xmath29 are defined as follows : @xmath30 in what follows , we present the constraints on the @xmath31 parameters coming from various classes of processes .",
    "( the plots have been produced using the ckmfitter package @xcite . )    in figure [ fig : cpcvut ] we compare the constraints from cp conserving processes to those from cp violating ones .",
    "the cp conserving observables are the mass difference in the neutral @xmath10 system , @xmath32 , and the lower bound on the mass difference in the @xmath33 system , @xmath34 .",
    "the cp violating observables are the indirect cp violation in @xmath1 decays , @xmath35 , and the cp asymmetry in @xmath6 decays , @xmath36 .",
    "there are two important lessons to be drawn from this comparison :    * since there is a significant overlap between the allowed regions in the two panels , we learn that the two sets of constraints are consistent with each other .",
    "thus it is very likely that the km mechanism is indeed the source of the observed cp violation . *",
    "the constraints from the cp violating observables are stronger than those from the cp conserving ones .",
    "while the allowed ranges are related to the experimental accuracy , an important factor in this situation is the fact that cp is a good symmetry of the strong interactions .",
    "( the effects of @xmath37 are irrelevant to meson decays . )",
    "consequently , some cp asymmetries can be theoretically interpreted with practically zero hadronic uncertainties .    another way to see",
    "the consistency of the km picture of cp violation is the following . within the standard model",
    ", there is a single cp violating parameter .",
    "therefore , roughly speaking , a measurement of a single cp violating observable simply determines the value of this parameter .",
    "this situation is demonstrated in the left panel of figure [ fig : smut ] , where the constraints from all but the @xmath38-measurement are used to produce an allowed range in the @xmath31 plane . a second measurement of a cp violating observable tests this mechanism , as demonstrated in the same figure by overlaying the constraint from the measurement of @xmath36 .",
    "( it is amusing to note that in ref .",
    "@xcite , the allowed range for @xmath36 from the fit to all other observables is quoted to be @xmath39 , to be compared with the range from the direct measurements in eq .",
    "( [ spkswa ] ) . ) the allowed region in the ( @xmath40 ) plane from the combination of all observables is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : smut ] .",
    "we can again draw several conclusions :    * the ckm matrix provides a consistent picture of all the measured flavor and cp violating processes .",
    "* the recent measurement of @xmath36 adds a significant constraint .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bkut ] we make one final comparison , between observables related to @xmath10 physics ( @xmath41 , left panel ) and to @xmath42 physics ( @xmath43 @xcite , right panel ) .",
    "the conclusions that we draw from this comparison are the following :    * there is no signal of new flavor physics .",
    "* at present , the constraints from @xmath10 physics are much stronger .",
    "future measurements of @xmath44 ( for both the charged and the neutral modes ) will be essential to make this comparison into a useful probe of new physics .      since , by the consistency between the predicted range and the measured value of the cp asymmetry in @xmath6 , the km mechanism of cp violation has successfully passed its first precision test , we are able to make the following statement :    _ very likely , the km mechanism is the dominant source of cp violation in flavor changing processes . _    thirty eight years have passed since the discovery of cp violation @xcite and twenty nine years have passed since the km mechanism has been proposed @xcite . but only now , following the impressively precise measurements by belle and babar that yield ( [ spkswa ] ) , we can make the above statement based on experimental evidence .",
    "this is a very important step forward in our theoretical understanding of cp violation .",
    "we would like to emphasize , however , three important points in the above statement :    1 .   _",
    "` very likely : ' _ since we are using only two cp violating observables , the consistency of the km picture could be accidental .",
    "additional measurements are crucial to make a more convincing case for the validity of the km mechanism .",
    "` dominant : ' _ the accuracy of the standard model prediction for @xmath36 is of @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , it is quite possible that new physics contributes to meson decays at this level .",
    "` flavor changing : ' _ while we have good reasons to think that flavor changing cp violation is dominated by standard model processes , the situation could be very different for flavor diagonal cp violation . here",
    ", the km mechanism predicts unobservably small cp violation , while new physics can dominate such observables by several orders of magnitude .",
    "future searches of edms are crucial to clarify this point .",
    "cp violation in meson decays is a complex phenomenon .",
    "this is best demonstrated by examining cp violation in neutral meson decay into a final cp eigenstate .",
    "( @xmath46 stands here for any of the @xmath42 , @xmath47 , @xmath10 and @xmath33 mesons . )",
    "[ fig : btofcp ]    each arrow in this figure stands for an amplitude that carries an independent cp violating phase .",
    "the various interferences between the different paths from @xmath48 to @xmath49 yield three distinct manifestations of cp violation :    1 .   _ in decay : _ @xmath50.\\ ] ] 2 .   _ in mixing : _",

    "_ in interference ( of decays with and without mixing ) : _ @xmath52.\\ ] ]    one of the beautiful features of cp violation is that experiments can measure each of these three types separately .",

    "is sensitive to only cp violation in decay : @xmath53    \\2 .",
    "the cp asymmetry in semileptonic neutral @xmath10 decays is sensitive to only cp violation in mixing : @xmath54    \\3 .",
    "the cp asymmetry in neutral @xmath10 decays probes separately @xmath55 ( a combination of cp violation in mixing and in decay ) and @xmath56 ( purely cp violation in the interference of decays with and without mixing ) @xcite : @xmath57 note that babar s @xmath58 corresponds to belle s @xmath59 .",
    "further note that the latter notation suggests that this cp asymmetry is analogous to @xmath60 measured in charged @xmath10 decays .",
    "formally , @xmath61 measures deviations of @xmath55 from unity while @xmath60 measures deviations of @xmath62 from one .",
    "however , the deviation of @xmath63 from unity is known to be @xmath64 and , given the present sensitivity of searches for @xmath65 , can be safely neglected . in practice , therefore , the analogy is justified .",
    "there is a class of cp asymmetries in neutral meson decays into final cp eigenstates that theorists love most .",
    "it involves decays where the direct decay amplitude is dominated by a single weak phase , so that cp violation in decay can be neglected ( @xmath66 ) and where the effect of cp violation in mixing can be neglected ( @xmath67 ) . in this case @xmath68 , and the only remaining cp violating effect is @xmath69 .     [",
    "fig : btofcp1 ]    the reason that this case is the theorists favorite is that the theoretical interpretation , in terms of lagrangian parameters , is uniquely clean .",

    "historically , a different language has been used to parametrize the various cp violating observables .",
    "the translation between that language and our language is straightforward : @xmath73 where the subindex @xmath74 refers to final two pions in an isospin - zero state , while the @xmath75 and @xmath76 sub - indices refer to , respectively , @xmath77 and @xmath78 final states .",

    "since the measured value of @xmath204 is consistent with the standard model prediction , it is also consistent with models of exact universality .",
    "such models provide a well motivated example of a class of models where the ckm matrix is the only source of flavor changing and cp violating couplings .",
    "this framework is often called ` _ minimal flavor violation _ ' ( mfv ) @xcite ( for recent analyses , see @xcite ) . in contrast , the consistency of the measured @xmath204 with the standard model prediction provides interesting constraints on models with genuinely supersymmetric sources of flavor and cp violation @xcite .",
    "in particular , models of heavy squarks , where flavor violation is only very mildly suppressed @xcite , are disfavored .",
    "the search for mixing and cp violation in the neutral @xmath47 system is the most promising probe of supersymmetric models with alignment . here , there are two important points concerning cp violation .",
    "first , given that it is not impossible for the standard model contributions to induce mixing close to present bounds @xcite , cp violation in mixing is crucial to make a convincing case for new physics @xcite .",
    "second , the possible presence of cp violation should be taken into account when translating the experimental bounds into constraints on new physics . specifically , one obtains @xcite @xmath205 compared to the pdg bound of @xmath206 which assumes vanishing weak and strong phases .",
    "the bound of eq .",
    "( [ motdcpv ] ) implies a severe constraint on squark masses in alignment models @xcite .",
    "the mechanism by which supersymmetric flavor and cp violation are suppressed relates directly to the mechanism of dynamical supersymmetry breaking . in this sense , if supersymmetry is discovered , measurements of cp violating observables will play a crucial role in understanding the full high - energy theory @xcite .",
    "future searches for edms are important in this context . while supersymmetric models with only the kobayashi - maskawa phase as a source of cp violation ( such as certain models of gauge mediation ) typically give @xmath207 cm , those where supersymmetry breaking is communicated at or close to the planck scale typically give @xmath208 cm .",
    "we choose the question of whether supersymmetry can significantly modify the cp asymmetry in the @xmath71 decay to demonstrate several points that have more general applicability .",
    "supersymmetry contributes to the @xmath71 decay via , for example , gluonic penguin diagrams with intermediate squarks and gluinos @xcite .",
    "[ fig : btophik ]    two crucial questions , regarding the size of this effect , come immediately to mind :    @xmath0 is it still possible that new physics has an @xmath209 effect on @xmath210 when the measured value of @xmath204 is so close to the standard model prediction ?",
    "the answer to this question is positive . assuming that the consistency is not accidental , it teaches us that the effect of new , cp violating physics in @xmath211 transitions is small .",
    "the @xmath71 decay involves , however , not only @xmath86 mixing but also the @xmath112 decay .",
    "there is no similar indication for the smallness of new , cp violating effects in @xmath121 transitions .    in the language of supersymmetry",
    ", the @xmath204 constraint applies to @xmath212 @xcite while @xmath71 depends also on @xmath213 .",
    "@xmath0 is it still possible that new physics has an @xmath209 effect on @xmath210 when the measured value of @xmath214 is close to the standard model prediction ?",
    "the answer to this question is , again , positive .",
    "the @xmath215 rate teaches us that the effects of new , helicity changing physics in @xmath121 transitions is small .",
    "the @xmath71 decay involves , however , also helicity conserving contributions , which are much more weakly constrained @xcite .    in the language of supersymmetry ,",
    "the @xmath216 constraint is significant for @xmath217 while @xmath71 depends also on @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "having answered these two generic questions in the affirmative , one may ask a third question that is more specific to supersymmetry :    @xmath0 are there well motivated supersymmetric models where new , cp violating effects in @xmath121 transitions could be particularly large ?    we are aware of , at least , two classes of models where this is indeed the case .",
    "first , in models where an abelian horizontal symmetry determines the flavor structure of both the quark yukawa matrices and the squark mass - squared matrices , the supersymmetric mixing angles are related to the quark parameters @xcite . in particular , we have @xmath220 note , however , that if alignment is to solve the supersymmetric flavor problem without any squark degeneracy , @xmath221 must be suppressed compared to the estimate ( [ abebs ] ) . similarly , in models where a non - abelian horizontal symmetry determines all flavor parameters , @xmath222 and so is the difference between @xmath223 and @xmath204 @xcite .",
    "second , in supersymmetric gut theories , the @xmath224 mixing is related to the @xmath225 mixing .",
    "the latter is required to be of order one to explain the atmospheric neutrino measurements .",
    "this intriguing relation has particularly interesting consequences in the framework of @xmath226 theories , where one obtains @xcite @xmath227              the general conclusion of the discussion of supersymmetry is that , if the consistency between experiment and the standard model concerning @xmath204 is not accidental , then large ( _ i.e. _ @xmath228 ) cp violating effects in @xmath211 transitions are disfavored .",
    "in contrast , the constraints on new cp violating effects in @xmath121 transitions are much milder .",
    "we would like to demonstrate this point by performing a premature but , hopefully , thought - provoking exercise . instead of the `` @xmath10-triangle '' and `` @xmath42-triangle '' of figure [ fig : bkut ] , we now divide the loop processes ( sensitive to new physics ) into three classes .",
    "first , those involving @xmath229 flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transitions .",
    "this triangle is identical to the @xmath42-triangle presented in figure [ fig : bkut ] .",
    "second , processes involving @xmath211 fcnc transitions . here",
    "we include only @xmath32 and @xmath204 . finally , the constraints that arise from the lower bound on @xmath230 and from the bounds on @xmath126 . both constraints involve , in addition to the @xmath231 mixing amplitude , @xmath121 fcnc transitions .",
    "the results of this exercise are presented in figure [ fig : sdbdbs ] .",
    "there is one solid statement that can be made on the basis of this presentation : _ there is still a lot to be learnt from future measurements_. in particular , the probing of new physics in fcnc and in cp violating processes will become much more sensitive when the following is achieved :    @xmath0 the @xmath211 triangle : the experimental accuracy and theoretical understanding of @xmath10 decays that depend on @xmath171 , @xmath24 , @xmath15 and @xmath232 improve .",
    "@xmath0 the @xmath229 triangle : @xmath233 is measured more precisely and the cp violating @xmath234 is measured @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 the @xmath121 triangle : the cp asymmetries in @xmath71 and other @xmath112 processes are measured more precisely and @xmath34 and cp asymmetries in @xmath33 decays are measured .",
    "@xmath0 standard model zeros : the experimental sensitivities to cp violation in @xmath235 mixing and to edms improve .",
    "we have made a significant progress in our understanding of cp violation .",
    "for the first time , we are able to make the following statement based on experimental evidence :          in particular , the superweak scenario is excluded by the observation of direct cp violation in @xmath1 decays , and the scenario of approximate cp is excluded by the observation of an order one cp asymmetry in @xmath6 decays .",
    "one has also to bear in mind that rather large corrections are still possible in @xmath34 , in cp asymmetries in @xmath33 decays , and in cp asymmetries in @xmath10 decays related to @xmath236 transitions .",
    "i am grateful to sandrine laplace for working out the ckm fits , for producing the figures of the unitarity triangle constraints , and for many useful discussions .",
