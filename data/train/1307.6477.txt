    "sparse matrices are particularly useful in applied and computational mathematics because of their low storage complexity and fast implementation as compared to dense matrices . of late",
    ", significant progress has been made to incorporate sparse matrices in compressed sensing , with @xcite giving both theoretical performance guarantees and also exhibiting numerical results that shows sparse matrices coming from expander graphs can be as good sensing matrices as their dense counterparts .",
    "in fact , blanchard and tanner @xcite recently demonstrated in a gpu implementation how well these type of matrices do compared to dense gaussian and discrete cosine transform matrices even with very small fixed number of nonzeros per column ( as considered here ) .    in this manuscript",
    "we consider random sparse matrices that are adjacency matrices of lossless expander graphs .",
    "expander graphs are highly connected graphs with very sparse adjacency matrices , a precise definition of a lossless expander graph is given in definition [ def : expander ] .",
    "[ def : expander ] @xmath0 is a lossless @xmath1-expander if it is a bipartite graph with @xmath2 left vertices , @xmath3 right vertices and has a regular left degree @xmath4 , such that any @xmath5 with @xmath6 has a set of neighbors @xmath7 with @xmath8 neighbors .",
    "note that these graphs are _ lossless _",
    "because @xmath9 , they are also referred to as _ unbalanced expanders _ in the literature because @xmath10 and a @xmath11-lossless expander graph has an _ expansion _ of @xmath12 .",
    "such graphs have been well studied in theoretical computer science and mathematics and have many applications .",
    "probabilistic constructions of such graphs using random left - regular bipartite graphs with optimal parameters exist but deterministic constructions only achieve sub - optimal parameters , see @xcite or @xcite for a more detailed survey .    using a novel technique of _ dyadic splitting of sets _ , this work derives quantitative guarantees on the probabilistic construction of these graphs in the form of a bound on the tail probability of the size of the _ set of neighbors _ , @xmath13 for a given @xmath5 , of a randomly generated left - degree bipartite graph .",
    "moreover , this tail bound proves a bound on the tail probability of the _ expansion _ of the graph , @xmath14 . in addition , we derive the first phase transitions showing regions in parameter space that depicting when a left - regular bipartite graph with a given set of parameters is guaranteed to be a lossless expander with high probability .",
    "similar results in terms of the adjacency matrices of these graphs is also presented .",
    "another contribution of this work is the derivation of sampling theorems comparing performance guarantees for some of the algorithms proposed for compressed sensing using such sparse matrices as well as the more traditional @xmath15 minimization compressed sensing formulation .",
    "it also provides phase transitions of @xmath15 minimization performance guarantees for such sparse matrices compared to what @xmath16 restricted isometry constants ( @xmath17 ) analysis yields for gaussian matrices .",
    "our main result is the presentation of formulae for the expected cardinality of the _ set of neighbors _ of @xmath11-lossless expander graphs and the sparse non - mean zero matrices from these graphs .",
    "based on this , we present a tail bound on the probability that this cardinality will be less than the expected value .",

    "if @xmath18 is either an se or sse it will have only @xmath4 nonzeros per column and since we fix @xmath22 , @xmath18 is therefore extremely sparse .",
    "we formally define the _ set of neighbors _ in both graph theory and linear algebra notation to aid translation between the terminology of the two communities .",

    ".    for one fixed set of columns of @xmath18 , denoted @xmath23 , the probability in can be understood as the cardinality of the unions of nonzeros in the columns .",
    "our analysis of this probability follows from a nested unions of subsets using a _",
    "dyadic splitting _ technique . given a starting set of columns we recursively split the number of columns from this set and the resulting sets into two sets of cardinality of the ceiling and floor of the cardinality of their union until a level when the cardinalities are at most two . resulting from this type of splitting is a regular binary tree where the size of each child is either the ceiling or the floor of the size of it s parent set .",
    "the probability of interest becomes a product of the probabilities involving all the children from the dyadic splitting of @xmath34 .",
    "the proof therefore reduces to upper bounding this product .",
    "furthermore , in the binary tree resulting from our dyadic splitting scheme the number of columns in the two children of a parent node is the ceiling and the floor of half of the number of columns of the parent node . at each level of the split",
    "the number of columns of the children of that level differ by one .",
    "the enumeration of these two quantities at each level of the splitting process is necessary in the computation of the bound in .",
