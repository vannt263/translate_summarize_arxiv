    "in extensions of the standard model ( sm ) new heavy particles typically appear . for example , supersymmetric extensions of the sm include heavy stop quarks ( stops ) , which are the supersymmetric partners of top quark @xcite . a stop quark and a stop antiquark ( antistop ) can bind to form a spectrum of stoponium states .",
    "the decays of these states into two photons potentially provide a clean signal for their detection",
    ". however , stoponium states typically have rather small gluon - fusion cross sections times branching ratios into two photons  @xcite .    extensions of the sm can also contain heavy higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "the presence of new higgs doublets is motivated by weak - scale extensions of the sm that aim to address the disparity between the electroweak and planck scales and to provide explanations of the origins of flavor and of the matter - antimatter asymmetry . in these theories ,",
    "the sm description is recovered in the so - called decoupling regime , in which the masses of the heavy higgs bosons become large .",
    "in such a regime , the heavy neutral higgs bosons may decay into pairs of third - generation fermions , including top quarks .",
    "owing to the presence of these tree - level decays , the branching ratio of loop - induced decay processes is suppressed , making it difficult to observe the decay of the heavy higgs to two photons .",
    "the interplay of a heavy - stop - antistop system with a heavy higgs boson whose mass is near the stop - antistop production threshold results in interesting and intricate new phenomena .",
    "loop - induced processes may be enhanced in the presence of heavy quarks or squarks that are strongly coupled to the heavy higgs bosons . in supersymmetric extensions of the sm , the dimensionful coupling of stops to the heavy higgs bosons",
    "is governed by the higgsino mass parameter @xmath0 .",
    "loop - induced processes may be significantly modified if the heavy quarks or squarks have masses that are comparable to that of the heavy higgs boson . the modification to loop - induced processes may be especially important if there is a production threshold for heavy particle - antiparticle pairs that is close to the higgs mass  @xcite .    near threshold",
    ", qcd perturbation - expansion contributions of relative order @xmath1 may receive @xmath2 enhancements , where @xmath3 is half of the relative velocity between the stop and the antistop in the stop - antistop center - of - momentum ( cm ) frame .",
    "such enhanced contributions are typically proportional to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the strong - interaction running coupling and @xmath6 is the stop - quark mass .",
    "the presence of these enhanced contributions requires a resummation of the perturbative contributions , which , among other things , takes into account the formation of stop - antistop bound states .",
    "the issue of gluon - fusion higgs production and decay to diphotons at the stop - antistop production threshold has been addressed recently in ref .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite recognized the possibility that higgs - stoponium mixing and the formation of stop - antistop bound states and could have a significant effects on the @xmath7 rate .",
    "they pointed out , as is stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that stoponium effects lead to higgs - digluon ( @xmath8 ) and higgs - diphoton ( @xmath9 ) form factors that are enhanced relative to the form factors that are obtained in fixed - order perturbative calculations .",
    "we note , though , that the description in refs .  @xcite does not explicitly account for all of the higgs - stoponium mixing effects  @xcite .    in this article , we provide a detailed analysis of the interplay between a heavy higgs boson and a heavy stop - antistop pair for higgs masses that are close to the stop - antistop production threshold .",
    "we take into account threshold enhancements to the stop - antistop amplitudes by means of the analogues for scalar quarks of the effective field theories non - relativistic qed ( nrqed )  @xcite and non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite . in this framework , we are also able to give a description of higgs - stop - antistop mixing near threshold that incorporates fully the effects that are contained in the stop - antistop green s function .    in order to make contact with recent numerical work on the higgs - stop - antistop system we choose , in our numerical work , a stop mass of @xmath10  gev , and assume that the higgs mass is near the stop - antistop production threshold , which is @xmath11  gev .",
    "much of the recent numerical work in the literature was motivated by initial results from the atlas and cms experiments that showed excesses in rates for the process @xmath12 at diphoton masses around 750  gev @xcite ( for an extensive list of theoretical work that is related to this signal , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , we emphasize that our work is not tied to any particular phenomenological model and that it is aimed at understanding the general features of a higgs - stop - antistop system near threshold .",
    "we find that effects of higgs - stop - antistop mixing go beyond the modification of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 form factors and significantly change the diphoton production rate near the stop - antistop threshold with respect to the rate that would be obtained from simple addition of the higgs and stoponium contributions .",
    "for higgs masses near threshold , we find that several mechanisms that arise from higgs - stop - antistop mixing suppress the diphoton rate relative to the rates that are obtained in perturbative calculations : ( 1 ) for small stop widths , mixing significantly increases the width of the narrowest physical state relative to the width of the unmixed stoponium state ; ( 2 ) mixing shifts masses of physical states away from the region in which form - factor enhancements occur ; ( 3 ) mixing shifts some physical - state masses above threshold , where , in the case of strong higgs - stop - antistop couplings , the states develop large decay widths into stop - antistop pairs ; ( 4 ) for strong higgs - stop - antistop couplings , the mixing changes the heights and widths of the physical resonances that lie below threshold .    in some of our numerical work , we employ rather large values of the higgs - stop - antistop coupling . in some specific models of the higgs - stop - antistop system , such large values of the coupling",
    "could lead to the presence of color - symmetry - breaking minima in the potential for the vacua  @xcite .",
    "since , in our work , we are not focused on any specific model realization of the higgs - stop - antistop system , we will not study these possible constraints .",
    "however , they would have to be taken into account in the construction of detailed models .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : eft ] , we describe the effective - field - theory approach that we employ . we also give formulas for the @xmath13 amplitude that account fully for the higgs - stop - antistop mixing .",

    "we are concerned with the situation in which @xmath15 is near @xmath17 , the threshold for stop - antistop production .",
    "because the amplitude is computed near threshold , there can be important effects from the binding or near - binding of the stop - antistop pair that are not captured in fixed - order perturbation theory .",
    "it is convenient to take these effects into account by making use of the analogues for scalar quarks of the effective field theories nonrelativistic qed ( nrqed ) @xcite and nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite .",

    "the short - distance coefficient @xmath44 takes into account the @xmath45-channel exchange of the heavy higgs boson between the stop and the antistop .",
    "the quantity @xmath46 is also a short - distance coefficient that accounts for decays of a stop - antistop pair into two gluons .",

    "the real parts of the poles locations , @xmath274 , and the imaginary parts of the pole locations , @xmath275 , determine the resonance widths , which are different than in the breit - wigner case .",
    "an important additional difference is that the residues of those poles , @xmath276 , which are equal to unity in the breit - wigner case , can now have magnitudes that are larger or smaller than unity .",

    "( [ g - c - s ] ) , as well .",
    "fifth , in the coulomb - schrdinger analysis , we include the effects of the @xmath45-channel higgs exchange on the stop - antistop propagator .",
    "had we included these effects in the breit - wigner analysis , they would have produced only small shifts in the mass of the breit - wigner resonance . in the coulomb - schrdinger analysis",
    ", it turns out that the @xmath45-channel higgs exchange has a negligible effect for the case @xmath213 .",

    "as we have mentioned , in the approximation in which a resonance amplitude is given by a breit - wigner form and the separation of the resonance from other resonances is small in comparison to the resonance widths , the contribution of a resonance to the cross section is proportional to the square of the maximum height of the absolute value of the amplitude times the full width at half maximum of the peak in the absolute value of the amplitude .",
    "specifically , in the present case , the cross - section contribution is proportional to @xmath278 .",
    "in this section we present numerical results for the @xmath279 amplitudes and the associated lhc cross sections at @xmath280  tev for the case in which the stop - antistop green s function is calculated from the coulomb - schrdinger green s function [ eq .  ( [ g - c - s ] ) ] .",
    "heavy - higgs production and decay rates depend not only on the higgs coupling to the stop squark , but also on the higgs couplings to the top and bottom quarks .",
    "as we have mentioned , we make use of an intermediate value of @xmath86 , setting @xmath281 , where @xmath80 and @xmath78 are the @xmath94 running masses at the scale @xmath245 . at this value of @xmath86 , the higgs decay width into third generation fermions is minimized and is about 1.2  gev .",
    "the additional contributions to the higgs production rate and decay width that are associated with higgs couplings to stop - antistop pairs are automatically taken into account within our theoretical framework .",
    "the contributions to the total width from the decay of the heavy higgs into pairs of higgs or heavy gauge bosons tend to be small , and we omit them in our analysis .",

    "we also give results that are based on the full coulomb - schrdinger green s function in eq .",
    "( [ g - c - sa ] ) . in the figures for the amplitudes below ,",
    "we show , for clarity , the results that are obtained by retaining only one pole in the stop - antistop green s function .",

    "( [ g - c - sa ] ) . in these figures , we show the following : ( 1 ) @xmath288 ; ( 2 ) @xmath289 , where superscript `` bare '' means that the stop - antistop corrections to the higgs propagator in eq .",

    "we remind the reader that , as we have explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : breit - wigner ] , the cross - section contribution of a resonance whose amplitude can be approximated by a breit - wigner form is proportional , in the narrow - width approximation , to the square of the maximum height of the absolute value of the amplitude times the full width at half maximum of the absolute value of the amplitude .      in this case , the higgs boson couples only weakly to the stop , and the stop width is much less than the higgs width .    in fig .",

    "the system of a heavy higgs boson that is coupled to a stop - antistop pair exhibits some interesting field - theoretic phenomena near the stop - antistop production threshold .",
    "this system has attracted interest in the context of the production of a heavy higgs boson near the stop - antistop threshold and its subsequent decay to two photons @xcite , owing to the perturbative enhancement of the higgs couplings to photons and gluons near threshold . however , as is well known , the appearance of coulomb infrared singularities near threshold invalidates the use of fixed - order perturbation theory .",
    "these coulomb singularities first appear at two - loop order in the higgs - to - diphoton and higgs - to - digluon form factors .",
    "they occur when @xmath3 ( one half the stop - antistop relative velocity in the stop - antistop cm frame ) goes to zero , and they are a manifestation of the general phenomenon of @xmath50 enhancements of two - particle amplitudes near threshold .",
    "these enhancements require an all - orders treatment , and they lead , among other things , to the formation of stoponium bound states .    a discussion of nonperturbative threshold effects is given in ref .",
    "@xcite and focuses on the enhancements of the higgs - to - diphoton and higgs - to - digluon form factors that are induced by the stop - antistop bound states  @xcite .",
    "the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that nonperturbative threshold effects produce an enhancement of the digluon - to - diphoton cross section , relative to the predictions for the cross section that are based on perturbative treatments of the higgs - to - diphoton and higgs - to - digluon form factors near threshold .",
    "however , a correct treatment of the threshold effects also requires a complete analysis of higgs - stop - antistop mixing effects .    in this paper",
    ", we have formulated the calculation of the threshold enhancements to the digluon - to - diphoton cross section in terms of the scalar - quark analogues of the effective field theories nrqed and nrqcd .",
    "our treatment is valid up to corrections of relative order @xmath26 .",
    "the effective theory gives a complete accounting of higgs - stop - antistop mixing in the threshold region .",
    "we have studied these enhancement and mixing effects numerically by making use of a model green s function for the stop - antistop system , namely , the coulomb - schrdinger green s function .",
    "the coulomb - schrdinger green s function does not correctly account for the qcd confining potential , which should be coulombic only for the lowest - lying stoponium bound states .",
    "therefore , we have considered the case in which the expression for the coulomb - schrdinger green s function is truncated so that it contains only a few bound states .",
    "this approach retains only those bound states for which the coulombic approximation is expected to be valid , and it is in keeping with the actual stoponium spectrum , which is expected have only a few bound states . at a qualitative level , we have checked that the results that we have obtained are independent of the number of bound states that we have retained .",
    "moreover , the quantitative differences that are associated with the inclusion of heavier bounds states are small , giving us confidence that our conclusions are not dependent on the specifics of the model green s function that we have chosen .",
    "we have also investigated a simplified model in which the stop - antistop green s function is represented by a simple breit - wigner resonance .",
    "this simplified model exhibits some , but not all , of the qualitative features of the more complicated coulomb - schrdinger model .",
    "we have found that the higgs - stop - antistop mixing produces three general effects that are very significant .",
    "first , the mixing leads to mass eigenstates whose widths are larger than the widths of the stoponium states . for a single stoponium state and for large values of the higgs - stop - antistop coupling , the widths of the mass eigenstates at threshold approach the average of the higgs and stoponium widths .",
    "these increases in the widths , and the concomitant reductions in the peak heights , reduce the contributions to the cross section relative to the contribution that would be obtained from a narrow stoponium state .",
    "second , the physical masses are shifted from the input higgs and stoponium masses and , when the higgs mass is near threshold , the physical masses are displaced away from the threshold region .",
    "this effect is particularly important for large values of the higgs - stop - antistop coupling and can render the perturbative threshold enhancements inoperative .",
    "third , when the higgs - stop - antistop coupling is large , the displacement of the mass of the higher - mass physical state to a point above threshold can give that state a very large width into a stop - antistop pair , resulting in a drastic reduction of its contribution to the cross section .",
    "in addition , to these general effects , there are some effects that depend on the details of the couplings of the higgs boson and the stop - antistop pair to photons and gluons and on the details of the coulomb - schrdinger green s function .",
    "for example , the couplings can mix in such a way as to produce a peak near threshold that has nothing to do with the threshold enhancements that are associated with the perturbative higgs - digluon and higgs - diphoton form factors .",
    "the coulomb - schrdinger green s function can also lead to changes in the heights and widths of the physical peaks in the amplitudes , relative to their heights and widths in the simple breit - wigner model .",
    "these effects are driven largely by the term of lowest order in @xmath5 , in the coulomb - schrdinger green s function .",
    "that term is universal in that it is independent of the nature of the squark - antiquark static potential .",
    "however , the details of the effects that arise from it seem to depend on nonuniversal features of the coulomb - schrdinger green s function .    in general , for large values of the heavy - higgs coupling to the stop - antistop pair , the mixing effects result in suppressions of the digluon - to - diphoton cross section at threshold relative to the cross section that is predicted in one - loop perturbation theory .",
    "the precise suppression factor depends not only on the higgs - stop - antistop coupling , but also on the stop width .",
    "we remind the reader that , because our focus is on the formulation of the calculation and on the qualitative features of the threshold physics , we have computed the higgs couplings to digluons and diphotons at the one - loop level , and , so , one should take care in comparing our numerical results with those in the literature , which often include two - loop effects .",
    "although we have concentrated on the case of the higgs - stop - antistop interaction , the theoretical framework that we have developed is applicable to the coupling of higgs bosons to other scalar particles in the region near the particle - antiparticle threshold .",
    "it can also be generalized easily to the case of a higgs boson coupled to heavy fermions and to calculations of rates to different final states .",
    "for example , one could study the case of a @xmath315 final state by replacing the @xmath20 short - distance coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ matrix - amps - a ] ) with the corresponding @xmath315 short - distance coefficients .",
    "vanishes if one neglects electromagnetic and weak interactions . ]",
    "we reserve the study of these additional cases for a separate publication .",
    "in the general case , which includes the example of the coulomb - schrdinger green s function , we can write eq .",
    "( [ matrix - amps - a ] ) as @xmath316 where @xmath317 , with @xmath318 given in eq .",
