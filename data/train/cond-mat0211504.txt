    "complexity of conformations of polymer chains should play an important role in the physics of polymers .",
    "various dynamical or statistical properties of entangled polymers in solutions or melts should be related to the complexity of polymer chains as space curves .",
    "for instance , the reptation theory takes into account the entanglement complexity of polymer chains around a polymer by assuming the tube along it @xcite .    however , it is not trivial to investigate any aspect of the complexity of conformations of polymers directly through computer simulation .",
    "in fact , it is not clear how to express the entanglement complexity numerically for mutually entangled polymers .",
    "furthermore , it is not known how the complexity of polymer conformations should depend on the property that polymer chains can not cross each other .    in this paper , we discuss the geometrical complexity of conformations of a ring polymer under some topological constraint . as a measure of geometrical complexity of a spatial curve , we consider the number of crossings in a planar projection of the curve , and take the average over some directions @xcite . through computer simluation",
    ", we evaluate the average crossing number for @xmath0-noded ring poymers with fixed knots , and discuss their behaviors with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "we thus make it clear how the topological constraints can modify the geometrical complexity . here",
    "we note that the condition that a ring polymer never cross with itself corresponds to a topological constraint on it , as far as its statistical properties are concerned .",
    "furthermore , we plot the graphs of the mean square radius of gyration versus the average crossing number , for the saps with fixed knots",
    ". then we find that the average crossing number and the mean - squared gyration radius behave independently under the topological constraints .",
    "it is thus suggested that the relation between the average sizes of ring polymers and the geometrical complexity of the conformations should be non - trivial .",
    "let us explain the average crossing number , more precisely .",
    "the _ writhe _ of a linear or ring polymer is defined by the average of the number of signed crossings appearing in a projection of the curve over all directions . as a simplified version of the writhe",
    ", janse van rensburg @xmath1 introduced _ the number of crossings _ @xcite .",
    "it is defined by the number of unsigned crossings in a projection .",
    "then , _ the average number of crossings _ is defined by the number of crossings averaged over all possible projections .",
    "there are several numerical or theoretical studies on the average crossing number @xcite .",
    "the average crossing number is also related to ideal knots . for a knot",
    ", the ideal knot is given by its tightest geometric configuration @xcite .",
    "katritch _ et . al _ have obtained the average crossing number for the ideal knots up to 11 essential crossing numbers .",
    "the average crossing number should be useful for flexible dna knots in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it should also be useful for statistical or dynamical studies on knotted ring polymers @xcite .",
    "we consider self - avoiding polygons ( saps ) consisting of @xmath0 rigid impenetrable cylinders of unit length and radius @xmath2 .",
    "there is no overlap allowed between any pair of non - adjacent cylindrical segments , while next - neighboring cylinders may overlap each other .",
    "we call them cylindrical saps , for short",
    ". a large number of cylindrical saps can be constructed by the cylindrical ring - dimerization method @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the algorithm of ring dimerization @xcite , and useful for generating long saps systematically . in this paper , we have constructed @xmath3=@xmath4 samples of @xmath0 cylindrical segments with radius @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is from 20 to 1000 and @xmath2 is from 0.0 to 0.07 .",
    "we determine the number @xmath5 of polygons with a knot @xmath6 , enumerating such polygons that have the same set of values of the two invariants : the determinant of the knot @xmath7 and the vassiliev invariant @xmath8 of the second degree .",
    "the mean value @xmath9 of the average crossing number for a set of saps is defined by @xmath10 . here",
    ", @xmath11 denotes the average crossing number of the @xmath12th polygon .",
    "the mean value of the average crossing number for a set of the saps with a knot @xmath6 is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the average crossing number of the @xmath12th sap having the knot @xmath6 .",
    "thus , @xmath9 is given by the average of @xmath15 s over all knots .",
    "in the simulation , we have obtained the average crossing number @xmath9 and @xmath15 s for the trivial and trefoil knots in the range of @xmath0 from 20 to 1000 . here , we evaluate the average crossing number by taking the average over the @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 directions .",
    "the mean square radius of gyration @xmath19 for saps with @xmath0 nodes is given by @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is the position vector of the @xmath22th node , and the symbol @xmath23 denotes the average over @xmath3 polygons generated . for a knot @xmath6 , we define the mean square radius of gyration @xmath24 for saps of the knot @xmath6 by @xmath25 @xcite . here , @xmath26 denotes the mean square radius of gyration for the @xmath12 th sap in the @xmath5 polygons of the knot @xmath6 . in terms of @xmath24 s , @xmath19",
    "is given by the average over all knots : @xmath27 .",
    "we now discuss the @xmath0 dependence of the average crossing number @xmath15 under the topological constraint of a knot @xmath6 .",
    "the double - logarithmic graph of @xmath15 versus @xmath0 is given in fig . 1 for the cylindrical saps of cylinder radius @xmath28 , for the trivial and trefoil knots .",
    "the graphs can be approximated by some straight lines in some large @xmath0 region .",
    "let us consider the ratio of @xmath15 to @xmath9 for the two knots . in fig .",
    "2 , the ratio @xmath29 versus @xmath0 is plotted in a double logarithmic scale for the trivial and trefoil knots .",
    "the graph of the trivial knot has a concave curve : the ratio @xmath30 is almost constant with respect to @xmath0 for small @xmath0 and then decreases with a larger gradient for large @xmath0 . on the other hand , the graph of the trefoil knot suggests that @xmath31 could be roughly approximated by a power of @xmath0 for some finite values of @xmath0 .    in fig .",
    "2 , the ratios @xmath29 s for the two knots become less than 1.0 when @xmath0 is large , i.e. , the @xmath15 s are less than the average crossing number @xmath9 averaged over all knots for large @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the topological constraints make the conformations of ring polymers simpler with respect to the geometric complexity , when @xmath0 is large enough .",
    "the reduction of conformational complexity may be related to entropic repulsion arising from the topological constraints .",
    "for the trivial knot , @xmath30 is smaller than 1.0 in the whole range of @xmath0 , while for the trefoil knot @xmath31 is larger than 1.0 for @xmath32 , and smaller than 1.0 for @xmath33 300 .",
    "thus , with respect to the average crossing number , the @xmath0-noded ring polymers with the trivial knot are less complex for any @xmath0 than those of no topological constraint , while those of the trefoil knot are more complex for small @xmath0 and less complex for large @xmath0 than those of no topological constraint .",
    "the average crossing number of the trivial knot , @xmath34 , is smaller than that of the trefoil knot , @xmath35 , through the whole range of @xmath0 .",
    "it suggests that the more complicated knot should have the larger value of the average crossing number , at least for finite @xmath0 .",
    "the tendency is also seen in the data for the different values of @xmath2 . as @xmath0 increases",
    ", however , the average crossing numbers @xmath15 s of the two knots gradually become close to each other and they become almost the same value when @xmath0 is very large .    the average crossing number @xmath15 of a knot @xmath6 have similar properties with the inverse of the mean - squared gyration radius @xmath36 of ring polymers with the knot @xmath6 . in our previous work @xcite , it is shown that for some random polygons and cylindrical saps , the double - logarithmic graph of the ratio @xmath37 versus @xmath0 is given by a downward convex curve and is larger than 1.0 for the trivial knot , while for the trefoil knot the graph is given by a straight line and the ratio @xmath37 is smaller than 1.0 for small @xmath0 and larger than 1.0 for large @xmath0 .",
    "we now consider possible asymptotic behaviors of the average crossing number .",
    "let us review some known results on the large @xmath0 behavior of @xmath0-step self - avoiding walks ( saws ) .",
    "the average crossing number can also be defined for saws , and we denote it by @xmath38 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is discussed that for asymptotically large @xmath0 , the mean value @xmath38 of the average crossing number of self - avoiding walks ( saws ) is given by @xmath39 with some constants @xmath40 and @xmath41 . here",
    "@xmath42 is given by the exponent of the average size of saws .",
    "we also note that in ref .",
    "@xcite , the large @xmath0 behavior of @xmath38 is approximated by a power of @xmath0 , @xmath43 , with the effective exponent : @xmath44 = 1.122 @xmath45 0.005 .    in order to illustrate some @xmath2 dependent properties of @xmath15 ,",
    "let us introduce an asymptoic expansion for the ratio @xmath29 versus @xmath0 .",
    "based on the asymptotic expansion of @xmath38 in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume the asymptotic expansion with repsect to @xmath0 as follows : @xmath46 for any knot @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 are fitting parameters . from the simulations @xcite",
    ", we may assume that @xmath49 .",
    "for the ratio @xmath29 , we thus have the following formula : @xmath50 . here , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are fitting parameters corresponding to @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "we apply it to the data of @xmath29 of the @xmath0-noded saps with @xmath0 larger than some cut - off and for the different values of @xmath2 .",
    "let us discuss the best estimates of @xmath53 plotted against cylinder radius @xmath2 in fig .",
    "3 . when @xmath2 is small , the ratio @xmath53 becomes smaller than 1.0 both for the trivial and trefoil knots .",
    "this is consistent with the observation of fig .",
    "2 that the ratio @xmath29 for @xmath28 decreases against @xmath0 and is smaller than 1.0 for large @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "3 , the ratio @xmath53 increases monotonically with respect to cylindrical radius @xmath2 , and it becomes close to the value 1.0 at some large value of @xmath2 . if the ratio @xmath29 becomes 1.0 , then there is no topological effect on the average crossing number . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath29 is less than 1.0 , then it may be a consequence of the topological constraint .",
    "thus , the behavior that the graph of @xmath53 versus @xmath2 increases upto 1.0 suggests that topological constraints on ring polymers make their conformations simpler for small @xmath2 , while the topological effect becomes weak for large @xmath2 .",
    "let us consider again the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath15 that the graph of @xmath53 versus @xmath2 increases upto 1.0 for the two knots , as shown in fig .",
    "a very similar behavior has also been observed for the case of the ratio @xmath37 of the mean squared gyration radii of the cylindrical saps with radius @xmath2 . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown for the cylindrical saps that a topological constraint on a ring polymer gives effective expansion to it , i.e. , the ratio @xmath37 becomes larger than 1.0 for large @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the effective expansion is significant when the cylinder radius @xmath2 is small ; the large @xmath0 limit of @xmath37 decreases to 1.0 as @xmath2 increases .    summarizing the simulation results , we may conclude that the effect of topological constraints should be significant when the ring polymer is thin , both for the average crossing number @xmath15 and the mean square radius of gyration @xmath24 .",
    "let us discuss that the relation between the average crossing number and the average size of ring polymers should be nontrivial . in fig .",
    "4 , the mean square radii of gyration @xmath19 and @xmath24 s are plotted against the average crossing numbers @xmath9 and @xmath15 s in a double logarithmic scale for the cylindrical saps of @xmath2=0.003 .",
    "the estimates of @xmath19 and @xmath36 s in fig .",
    "4 are different for any given value of the average crossing numbers .",
    "thus , it follows that the mean - squared gyration radius and the average crossing number are independent quantities describing some geometric properties of conformations of ring polymers .    with the same average crossing number given ,",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 are larger than @xmath19 for the cylindrical saps , as shown in fig .",
    "thus , we may say that the topological constraints make the average sizes of ring polymers larger with respect to the average crossing number . among the @xmath24 s , @xmath55 is larger than @xmath56 in fig .",
    "it is thus suggested that the more complicated knot should have the smaller radius of gyration , as far as some finite values of @xmath15 s are concerned .",
    "when the average crossing number is very large , the mean - squared gyration radius @xmath19 ( or @xmath24 ) can be approximated by some power of @xmath9 ( or @xmath15 ) : @xmath57 for the average over all knots ; @xmath58 for the trivial and trefoil knots . applying the power law approximation to the data of @xmath59",
    ", we obtain the following estimates of the effective exponents : @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the graphs of fig 4 suggests that the effective exponent @xmath63 should be independent of the knot type .",
    "similar results are obtained also for the saps with the different values of @xmath2 ."
