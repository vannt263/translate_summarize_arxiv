    "since electromagnetic system is a purely relativistic system , its coupling to gravity can be described , in principle , only general - relativistically . in our previous research , the effect of the gravitational field on stationary electromagnetic processes in conductors and superconductors in the presence of constant electric current has been investigated .",

    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we write maxwell equations in the schwarzschild space - time in section  [ meq ] .",
    "then in the next part of the paper , we will study the effect of gravity on the quasistationary time - varying electric current and magnetic field penetrating the conductor placed in the gravitational field .",
    "sections  [ skin_schw ] is devoted to investigation of the skin effect in the schwarzschild space - time and in a weak gravitational field when the curvature effects are locally negligible .",
    "in particular , new purely general - relativistic effects connected with the gravitational modification of penetration depth of magnetic field will be obtained .    the remarkable quantum phenomena exhibited by a superconductor show that the superconducting state in ginzburg - landau theory@xcite described by a wavefunction can be spread over the entire superconductor .",
    "the existence of macroscopic wavefunction raises the natural question of how it is influenced by the gravitational field . in the last part of the paper , that is , in sections  [ coherence_length]-[penet_ns ] we shall formulate the general formulae and their solutions needed to determine the influence of stationary gravitational field on the quasistationary electromagnetic phenomena for superconductors , from general - relativistic point of view and study the relevance of general - relativistic effects in superconductors of ii type on electrodynamics of magnetized neutron stars .",
    "this analysis has been motivated by the mixture commonly found in neutron star models , namely in the outer core region , where superfluid neutrons , superconducting protons and normal electrons are generally thought to coexist ( see for example , ref .",

    "consequently the ginzburg - landau parameter to be bigger than @xmath192 , which in its turn causes that the superconductivity inside neutron stars to be type i.    naturally the question arises whether the general relativistic effects arising from the strong gravitational field of neutron star can change the type of superconductivity or not .",
    "as we have shown here , due to the gravitational effect the coherence length is also modified by factor of @xmath57 ( the value of the parameter @xmath57 can reach @xmath193 for the typical neutron stars ) , but it does not lead to change of the type of superconductivity , as gravitational field reduces the magnitude of the penetration depth by the same factor so then the ginzburg - landau parameter will remain unchanged .",
    "it is well known that in superconductors of ii type below lower critical field @xmath169 there will be complete expulsion of the field ; above an upper critical field @xmath194 superconductivity will be destroyed ; in the intermediate range @xmath195 the superconductor will allow the magnetic field to penetrate , not homogeneously but confined to quantized flux tubes .",
    "each fluxoid carries a quantum of magnetic flux @xmath196 gauss @xmath197 @xmath198 . within the core of a fluxoid ( of radius @xmath90 ) , the matter is in its `` normal '' state .",
    "the field strength rises to about @xmath169 within this normal core . around this",
    "the matter is in the superconducting state , and the field strength decreases exponentially away from the core with a scale length @xmath188 . for protons in the interior of a neutron star ,",
    "the coherence length is @xmath199 cm and the london penetration depth is @xmath200 cm , where @xmath201 is the mass density of protons in units of @xmath202 g @xmath197 @xmath203 , and @xmath204 is the energy gap of the proton superconductor in mev ( ref .",
    "the vortex filaments consisting of neutron vortices and proton fluxoids inside superconducting region of neutron stars interact each other with an interaction energy which is equivalent to repulsion@xcite @xmath205 due to the gravitational effect the interaction energy would be less when compared with what could be expected in the flat space - time by a factor @xmath206 which is tiny and may be neglected during accounting one of the main forces which has been acted on proton fluxoids .",
    "here @xmath207 is the spacing between proton fluxoids .",
    "but there are the most important forces that act on proton fluxoids such as magnus force , buoyancy force , drag force and tension of fluxoids .",
    "but there are the most important forces that act on proton fluxoids such as magnus force , buoyancy force , drag force and tension of fluxoids .",
    "the collective effect of these forces leads fluxoids to move radially outward .",
    "the force@xcite @xmath208 acting on unit length of fluxoid ( due to neutron vortices ) does not depend on gravitational field and remains unchanged . here",
    "@xmath209 is the core radius , @xmath210 and @xmath211 are the rotation rate of the core superfluid and the rotation rate of the crust respectively .",
    "however the other forces such as buoyancy force arising from the existence of the magnetic stress in the core of a fluxoid and drug force that acted by the electron gas to a flux tube moving with the velocity @xmath212 depend on the gravitational field and would be modified when compared with the newtonian ones@xcite @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the electron fermi energy in the stationary gravitational field . in spite of",
    "the fact the gravitational field of neutron stars does not change the value of these forces acted on fluxoids enough , the motion of fluxoids inside neutron star might be changed . considering the equation of motion of fluxoids@xcite one can eventually see that difference of the rotation rate of the core superfluid from the rotation rate of the crust also depends on the value of the gravitational field .",
    "since the magnetic field decay from the core of neutron stars depends on interpinning of neutron superfluid and proton superconducting fluid@xcite , then the slightly modified equation of motion leads to the change of the decay timescale , but this modification is very small , and could not be important for considering the lifetime of the magnetic field persisting in neutron stars .",
    "following up our previous research on the electromagnetic properties of superconductors in gravitational field we have considered some general - relativistic effects associated with the influence of stationary gravitational field on quasi - stationary electromagnetic effects in conductors and superconductors .    by solving maxwell equations for the time - dependent magnetic field penetrating inside the conductor",
    "we have shown that the skin depth in the conductors embedded in the gravitational field strongly depends on the gravitational field .",
    "however this effect is almost negligible for the laboratory conductors in the weak gravitational field of the earth .",
    "the penetration depth for the magnetic field and the coherence length in superconductors also depend on the gravitational field and proportional to the lapse function of the gravitational object .",
    "however the parameter of ginzburg - landau remains unchanged and does not lead to the general relativistic modification of the type of the superconductivity .",
    "two critical magnetic fields that destroy the superconducting state also depend on the gravitational field : the gravitational field increases the value of the critical magnetic field .",
    "thus it has been shown that the strong gravitational field does effect to the quasi - stationary electromagnetic processes inside superconductors and one must take them into account during studying neutron star physics .",
