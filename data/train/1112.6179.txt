    "in his paper  @xcite , tutte took advantage of two natural operations on ( finite multi)graphs ( actually on isomorphism classes of multigraphs ) , deletion and contraction of an edge , in order to introduce the ring @xmath0 $ ] and a polynomial in two commuting variables @xmath1 , also known by whitney  @xcite , unique up to isomorphism since solutions of a universal problem .",
    "this polynomial , since called the tutte polynomial , is a graph invariant in at least two different meanings : first of all , it is defined on isomorphism classes , rather than on actual graphs , in such a way that two graphs with distinct tutte polynomials are not isomorphic ( a well - known functorial point of view ) , and , secondly , it is invariant with respect to a graph decomposition .",
    "indeed , let @xmath2 be a graph , and let @xmath3 be an edge of @xmath2 , which is not a loop ( an edge with the same vertex as source and target ) nor a bridge ( an edge that connects two connected components of a graph ) .",
    "the edge contraction @xmath4 of @xmath2 is the graph obtained by identifying the vertices source and target of @xmath3 , and removing the edge @xmath3 .",
    "we write @xmath5 for the graph where the edge @xmath3 is merely removed ; this operation is the edge deletion .",
    "let us consider the graph @xmath6 ( well - defined as isomorphic classes ) which can be interpreted as a decomposition of @xmath2 .",
    "then , the tutte polynomial @xmath7 is invariant with respect to this decomposition in the sense that @xmath8 .",
    "moreover this decomposition eventually terminates with graphs with bridges and loops only as edges , and the choice of edges to decompose is irrelevant .    in his paper",
    "@xcite , brylawski observed that the previous construction ( and many others , for instance the tutte polynomial for matroids ) may be explained in terms of an elegant and unified categorical framework ( namely a universal problem of invariants ) . in brief",
    ", brylawski considered an abstract notion of decomposition .",
    "let @xmath9 be a set , and let @xmath10 be an order relation on ( a part of ) the free commutative semigroup @xmath11 ( actually brylawski considered multisets , nevertheless the choice is here made to deal with semigroups since they play a central rle in this contribution ) , which satisfies a certain number of axioms that are quickly reviewed in informal terms below for the sake of completeness ( appendix  [ shortreviewbrylawski ] contains a short review of brylawski s theory in mathematical terms but it may be skipped ) and to show how natural is their translations in terms of rewriting systems .",
    "let @xmath12 be a set of formal ( finite ) sums @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 not all of them being zero ( an element of the free commutative semigroup @xmath11 on @xmath9 ) partially ordered by @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath16 such that @xmath17 , then we say that @xmath18 _ decomposes _ into @xmath19 or that @xmath19 is a _ decomposition _ of @xmath18 .",
    "therefore @xmath12 is seen as a set of commutative _",
    "decompositions_. elements of @xmath9 that belong to @xmath12 are assumed to be minimal with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "elements of @xmath20 that are maximal ( and therefore incomparable since also minimal ) are said to be _",
    "irreducible_. according to a second axiom satisfied by the order relation @xmath10 , an element @xmath21 can not be decomposed further into any other element of @xmath12 if , and only if , @xmath18 is a finite linear combination , with non negative integers as coefficients , of incomparable elements , that is , if @xmath22 is the set of all irreducibles , then @xmath18 is not decomposed into another element if , and only if , @xmath18 is a formal ( finite ) sum of elements of @xmath22 with non negative integers as coefficients .",
    "this property is similar to the notion of termination in rewriting systems .",
    "two other properties ( _ refinability _ and _ finiteness _ ) on @xmath12 ensure that every element of @xmath9 has one , and only one , `` terminal '' decomposition into irreducible elements .",
    "they are equivalent to convergence of a rewriting system .",
    "for instance , the order @xmath23 on the free commutative semigroup generated by all ( isomorphism classes of ) finite graphs satisfies these axioms and properties .",
    "now , to a decomposition @xmath24 with the above properties may be attached a group in a universal way .",
    "a function @xmath18 from @xmath9 to an abelian group @xmath2 is said to be _ invariant _ if for every @xmath25 such that @xmath26 ( @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ) , then @xmath27 .",
    "recall here that tutte polynomial @xmath7 is invariant because @xmath8 .",

    "in addition , @xmath32 is isomorphic to the free abelian group with the irreducible elements as generators . in the classical context of graph theory , as expected , @xmath32 is the additive structure of @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath7 is the tutte polynomial .",
    "many other decompositions enter in the scope of brylawski s theory ( see his paper  @xcite , examples and references therein ) .    in the present contribution",
    ", we adapt brylawski s results to the theory of ( string ) rewriting systems which we think is the natural framework to deal with theoretical notions of decomposition .",
    "moreover we extend previous works by allowing non commutative , and even partially commutative , decompositions . our main result , theorem  [ mainstatement ] , similar to brylawski s main theorem , states the existence and uniqueness of a universal group and a universal invariant associated to some kind of string rewriting systems , even if there are not convergent ( which is beyond the scope of brylawski s work ) . in case of convergence , we prove that the universal group under consideration is the free partially commutative group generated by irreducible letters , which is a generalization of the original result , and that the universal invariant is nothing else than the normal form function that maps an element to its normal form .",
    "we mention the fact that in this case , the universal group is proved to be the grothendieck completion of a monoid ( obtained from the semigroup subject to rewriting by free adjunction of an identity ) , which was not seen by brylawski even if he called tutte - grothendieck his universal construction .",

    "<S> this allows us to clarify the relations between the semigroup subject to rewriting and the tutte - grothendieck group : the later is actually the grothendieck group completion of the former , up to the free adjunction of a unit ( this was even not mention by brylawski ) , and normal forms may be seen as universal invariants . moreover we prove that such universal constructions are also possible in case of a non convergent rewriting system , outside the scope of brylawski s work . </S>"
