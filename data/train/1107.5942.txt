    "high mobility two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) subjected to the microwave radiation reveal giant magnetooscillations in the diagonal resistance @xmath0  @xcite with periodicity controlled by the positions of the cyclotron resonance harmonics . in high - quality samples ,",
    "these oscillations give rise to zero resistance states  @xcite ( zrs ) at the oscillation minima , @xmath1 , when the radiation power is increased and the temperature is lowered . in the corbino - disk geometry",
    "zrs manifest themselves as zero - conductance states .",
    "the widely accepted explanation of zrs combines two distinct phenomena .",
    "the first one is development of the giant magnetoresistance oscillations due to indirect optical transitions  @xcite or nonequilibrium occupation of electronic states  @xcite .",
    "both mechanisms predict , under appropriate conditions , a negative resistivity value in the oscillation minima at a small dc current . at some finite current density @xmath2",
    ", the resistivity crosses zero and becomes positive  @xcite .",
    "the second effect invoked for explanation of zrs is spontaneous formation of current domains with current density @xmath2  @xcite which occurs due to instability of systems with negative absolute and/or differential resistivity  @xcite . in the simplest geometry",
    "the system breaks into two domains carrying equal hall currents of opposite direction .",
    "the hall electric fields related to these currents are also equal in magnitude and have opposite directions .",
    "the resulting dissipative component of the resistivity or conductivity tensor is zero @xcite .",
    "two works @xcite provided an experimental evidence supporting the spontaneous domain formation in zrs .    in this paper we show that a positive diffusion coefficient can stabilize a homogeneous state of a _ finite _ 2des even though the system has a negative resistivity .",
    "we point out that combination of a negative resistivity and a positive diffusion coefficient naturally arises in 2des under microwave radiation . solving the transport equation jointly with the electrostatic problem for a finite 2des , we determine a stability condition which includes conductivity , diffusion coefficient , and the system size .",
    "further , we allow for a non - zero difference between the work functions of two contacts to 2des ( leads ) , that gives rise to the photogalvanic effects in an irradiated sample @xcite .",
    "we explore the distribution of the electrostatic potential and the electron density in such a sample for different values of the conductivity .",
    "most remarkably , we find that in the diffusion - stabilized regime of negative conductivity the system splits into two regions with opposite directions of electric field .",
    "we argue that this effect is a precursor of the domain structure that is expected to emerge spontaneously in microwave - induced zrs .",
    "the local dissipative current density in a weakly non - uniform 2des with surface electron density @xmath3 has a form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electrical potential in the 2des plane @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the surface gradient in this plane , @xmath8 is the dissipative component of the magnetoconductivity tensor ( per spin ) , and @xmath9 is the diffusion coefficient .    in equilibrium ,",
    "the conductivity @xmath10 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath11 obey the einstein relation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the equilibrium static compressibility ( here @xmath14 is the 2des chemical potential ) .",
    "the einstein relation guarantees that @xmath15 is zero in the equilibrium state with constant electrochemical potential @xmath16 ; further , the current response does not depend on the type of perturbation ( electric field or density gradient ) .    in the presence of microwaves",
    "the einstein relation is violated,@xcite @xmath17 this violation leads to the photogalvanic effects observed experimentally in refs .",
    "and is at the heart of the phenomena discussed in the present work .",
    "we start with demonstration that the theory  @xcite allows for coexistence of a negative dissipative conductivity and a positive diffusion coefficient .",
    "this result is the most prominent for the case when effect of the microwave radiation on the electron kinetics is governed by modification of the electron distribution function ( inelastic mechanism).@xcite for this mechanism , equations for the conductivity @xmath8 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath9 read @xmath18 @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the drude conductivity in a classically strong magnetic field , @xmath21 ; @xmath22 is the effective mass , @xmath23 the cyclotron frequency , and @xmath24 the transport relaxation time .",
