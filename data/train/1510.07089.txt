    "wormholes are tunnel - like objects , connecting two different regions of spacetime , which include a throat - like region with a minimum radius . the concept can be traced back as far as the 1916 paper by flamm @xcite , where he considered a tunnel - shaped  nature of space near the schwarzschild radius , which is possibly analogous to the modern concept of the wormhole throat .",
    "however , one can consider the 1935 paper of einstein and rosen as the first serious work on wormhole physics .",
    "the so - called einstein - rosen bridge was a construction of an elementary particle model represented by a bridge  connecting two identical sheets @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it was later shown that the einstein - rosen bridge is unstable , as it collapses before a photon has had time to pass through 3 .",
    "the term ` wormhole ' was coined for the first time in 1957 by john wheeler @xcite and a few wormhole solutions were investigated @xcite , before the seminal morris - thorne paper in 1988 , in which a static traversable wormhole solution was presented for the first time .",
    "it was shown that the energy - momentum distribution threading these solutions violated the energy conditions , in particular , it violates the null energy condition ( nec ) , and which has been denoted _",
    "exotic matter _ @xcite .",
    "in fact , it was shown that the exoticity of the matter is a generic and universal property of static wormholes within general relativity .",
    "this analysis was presented taking into account the local geometry at the throat , or in its vicinity , where the assumption of asymptotic flatness is not a necessary requirement @xcite .",
    "recently , the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite has also motivated research in wormhole physics , due to the possible presence of an exotic cosmic fluid responsible for this cosmic acceleration , i.e. , phantom energy , that violates the null energy condition phantomwh .",
    "observational features of wormholes physics have also been extensively analysed in the literature @xcite .",
    "relative to the energy condition violations , some attempts have been done in the literature to construct wormholes with normal matter @xcite .",
    "indeed , as the violation of the energy conditions is a particularly problematic issue lobo:2004wq , it is necessary to minimize its usage .",
    "in fact , to this aim , wormholes have been substantially examined from different points of view in the literature diffpo , diffpo0,diffpo4,diffpo2,diffpo1,diffpo3,18,modgravwh . in brane1",
    ", a class of static and spherically symmetric solutions in a vacuum brane was obtained where it was shown that bulk weyl effects support the wormhole .",
    "in fact , as it is the effective total stress energy tensor that violates the energy conditions , one may impose that the energy - momentum tensor confined on the brane , threading the wormhole , satisfies the nec .",
    "furthermore , the analysis carried out in @xcite was generalized in @xcite , by showing that in addition to the nonlocal corrections from the weyl curvature in the bulk , the local high - energy bulk effects may induce a nec violating signature on the brane . thus , braneworld gravity seems to provide a natural scenario for the existence of traversable wormholes .    from the beginning of introducing higher dimensional spacetimes , physicists faced questions on the size of these non - observable extra dimensions .",
    "the problem was first solved by compactifying the extra dimension on small enough regions , as the non - observability of the extra dimensions was due to their smallness .",
    "this idea has recently been substituted by another in that higher dimensions can be large but they are not observable as no observable matter and fields can exist there , and it is only gravity that propagates in these extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the latter approach is designated by the brane - world  scenario @xcite .",
    "the general formalism of the brane - world is to consider the metric of the observable world on a brane , which is embedded in a higher dimensional space denoted by the bulk . in this paper , although we do not use the typical formalism of the brane - world scenario , we apply its idea to obtain wormhole solution .",
    "we consider a theory consisting of third order lovelock gravity @xcite in addition to a cosmological constant .",
    "the constants of the theory are fixed so that there is no energy - momentum tensor except for the observable world . applying this , we first present both asymptotically flat and non - flat novel wormhole solutions in third - order lovelock gravity , and investigate the physical properties of these solutions , showing that it is possible that these traversable wormholes may be constructed from normal matter .    in fact ,",
    "it is interesting to note that it has recently been shown that exact traversable wormholes in @xmath7-dimensional general relativity can be constructed , in which the only exotic source  is a negative cosmological constant ( which can hardly be defined as exotic ) @xcite .",
    "based on the techniques developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors found the first self - gravitating , analytic and globally regular skyrmion solution of the einstein - skyrme system , in the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "more specifically , the equations admit analytic bouncing cosmological solutions in which the universe contracts to a minimum non - vanishing size , and then expands . a non - trivial byproduct of this solution is that a minor modification of the construction gives rise to a family of stationary , regular configurations in general relativity with a negative cosmological constant supported by an su(2 ) nonlinear sigma model .",
    "these solutions represent traversable ads wormholes with a nut parameter in which the only exotic matter  required for their construction is a negative cosmological constant .",
    "thus , for instance , one can have that a cloud of interacting pions ( described with the usual nonlinear sigma model ) in @xmath7-dimensional general relativity can support a traversable ads wormhole with nut charge .",
    "moreover , this wormhole is likely to be stable as the pions are in a configuration with a non - trivial topological charge and so they can not collapse to the trivial pions vacuum . as a last remark , at a first glance , if one deals with the nut parameter as it is usually done , then there are closed time - like curves . however , it was recently found that closed time - like curves can be avoided in spacetimes with a nut parameter when these are regular @xcite , as is the case with the solutions found in @xcite , so that one may , in principle , get rid of the closed time - like curves in the latter case , as well .",
    "this paper is outlined in the following manner : in section [ fe ] , we present the field equations in third order lovelock gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant term , which will be used in the subsequent sections . in section [ bra ] , by considering a @xmath4-dimensional spacetime @xmath8 which is a part of an @xmath0-dimensional @xmath9 spacetime where @xmath10 is a constant curvature space which we consider empty , we decompose the equations of motion to four and higher dimensional ones , and consequently write out the general four - dimensional gravitatinal field equations . in section sec : phys , by imposing a constant redshift function and considering a specific equation of state , we find specific wormhole solutions , i.e. , asymptotically flat and general wormhole spacetimes , and show that these solutions satisfy the energy conditions and are traversable .",
    "furthermore , for the non - asymptotically flat spacetimes , these interior geometries are matched to an exterior spherically - symmetric spacetime , in an ads universe .",
    "the generalized form of the gravitational field equation which maintains the properties of the einstein equation is the lovelock equation .",
    "thus , we consider third order lovelock gravity @xcite with a cosmological constant term , where the gravitational field equations are given by @xmath11where @xmath12 is the einstein tensor , the constants @xmath13 s are the lovelock coefficients , @xmath14 is the metric , the coupling constant of matter and gravity @xmath15 is set equal to @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , and @xmath18 is the energy - momentum tensor . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the second and third order lovelock tensors provided by @xmath21and @xmath22respectively , where @xmath23is the gauss - bonnet lagrangian and@xmath24is the third order lovelock lagrangian .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that due to the absence of derivatives of the curvatures in eq .",
    "( [ geq ] ) , it does not include the derivatives of the metric higher than two .",
    "it is also remarkable to note that the dimension of the spacetime should be equal or larger than seven so that all the terms in ( [ geq ] ) contribute in the field equation@xcite .",
    "in this section , we aim to present the field equations of a @xmath4-dimensional morris and thorne wormhole which is a part of an @xmath0-dimensioanl spacetime in third order lovelock gravity . more specifically , we will investigate the properties and characteristics of wormholes in a @xmath4-dimensional spacetime @xmath8 with the following metric @xmath25where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 represents the line element of a @xmath28-dimensional hypersurface with constant curvature @xmath29 , with @xmath30 .",

    "work along these lines is presently under consideration .",
    "an interesting and important issue is related to the stability of these solutions .",
    "one may ask which family of compactified wormholes is more stable ? indeed , the stability issue in lovelock theory is very complicated and certainly lies outside the scope of this paper . however , as a first approach one may analyze just the euclidean actions of the different configurations . at lowest order , the euclidean action provides the free energy and so one could compare the novel solutions presented in this work with some of the already known solutions by comparing the corresponding euclidean actions . in this way , one could find the range of parameters in which the novel solutions are favored with respect to previous ones . however",
