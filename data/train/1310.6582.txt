    "do the physics of neutrino mass and dark matter share the same origin ?",
    "the experimental evidence for neutrino mass  @xcite has provided a compelling reason to extend the minimal version of the standard model  ( sm ) . among possible ways to accommodate the neutrino mass , the introduction of gauge - singlet fermions ( right - handed neutrinos ) is one of the most natural and popular methods .",
    "similarly , the accumulated evidence for an unknown substance filling our universe , so - called dark matter  @xcite , has also provided an insight into physics beyond the sm .",
    "a new particle species which is stable , neutral , and non - baryonic excellently fits the observed nature of dark matter .",
    "interestingly , both of these two indicators may point to the existence of gauge - singlet fields beyond the sm .",
    "it is quite tempting to address these compelling issues by introducing the right - handed neutrinos and identifying one of them as the dark matter particle .    along this line , the simplest extension of the sm is just adding the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "in fact , three generations of right - handed neutrinos are able to accommodate the neutrino masses and mixing , dark matter , and baryon asymmetry of the universe  @xcite .",
    "another simple example is the model in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a gauge - singlet scalar which breaks @xmath2 gauge symmetry is introduced in addition to the three right - handed neutrinos . besides their simplicity , a virtue of these frameworks is that they can be free from the gauge hierarchy problem . since no intermediate scale between the electroweak / tev and the planck scale",
    "is introduced in these models , the problematic quadratic divergence in the higgs mass can be a matter of the high - energy boundary at which the theory becomes invalid  @xcite .",
    "since we do not know what sorts of boundary condition nature can realize , we may postpone a fundamental solution of the gauge hierarchy problem and attack compelling issues such as neutrino mass and dark matter within physics up to the tev scale .",
    "it is interesting to explore renormalizable theories beyond the sm that stand on the same footing as the sm .",
    "if this idea is further pushed with a few more new scalar fields , one meets with a group of models , the so - called radiative seesaw with right - handed neutrinos  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the usual neutrino yukawa couplings are forbidden by some symmetries so that the neutrino masses show up at some loop level . unlike the usual seesaw mechanism",
    ", the right - handed neutrinos do not mix with the left - handed ones and they are separated from the electroweak interactions at the tree level . the symmetries that forbid the yukawa couplings make the lightest particle running in the loop stable , providing a good candidate for dark matter .",
    "however , one may argue that there is an unsatisfying point which is common in the radiative models .",
    "in many cases , a discrete symmetry such as @xmath3 is imposed to forbid the yukawa couplings and stabilize the dark matter candidate .",
    "the use of a global discrete symmetry seems rather ad - hoc in view of the great success of the gauge principle of the sm .",
    "in addition , it has been argued that in the context of quantum gravity global symmetries are unnatural  @xcite .",
    "these facts motivate us to upgrade the global discrete symmetries to local ones .",
    "a simple realization of this idea , for example , is to derive @xmath3 symmetry as a remnant of a gauge symmetry broken at some high - energy scale  @xcite . along this line , various types of gauge symmetries such as @xmath4  @xcite , @xmath2  @xcite , and @xmath0  @xcite have been studied .    in this work ,",
    "we present yet another possibility for @xmath0 .",
    "we consider a @xmath0 gauge symmetry which acts on the three generations of the right - handed neutrinos @xmath5 as a symmetry behind the stability of dark matter .",
    "the usual sm particles are neutral under this @xmath0 .",
    "for the theory being anomaly free , the charges for @xmath6 are uniquely determined up to an overall factor and labeling of the generation ;    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the scalar @xmath7 is introduced to break @xmath0 down to @xmath3 becomes trivial for @xmath8 .",
    "this direction works as an odd parity for the fields with charge @xmath9 . ] .",
    "another scalar @xmath10 plays a role in the neutrino mass as we will see below .",
    "the usual standard model fields are neutral under @xmath0 .",

    "we assume that @xmath17 and @xmath18 take values around or less than tev to avoid fine tuning in the scalar masses .",

    "<S> the stable right - handed neutrino communicates with the standard model via @xmath1-channel exchange of the higgs field and the @xmath0 gauge boson , so that the observed relic density for dark matter is obtained in a wide range of the parameter space . </S>",
