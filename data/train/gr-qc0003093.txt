    "as pointed out by einstein @xcite , in special relativity theory it is assumed that the rate of a fundamental ( `` ideal '' ) clock depends on its instantaneous speed and is not affected by its instantaneous acceleration .",
    "this is usually called the `` clock hypothesis '' ; see @xcite for more recent discussions of this assumption .",
    "the decay of elementary particles obeys this hypothesis very well as shown by eisele @xcite for the weak decay of the muon .",
    "if we study electrodynamics , for instance , in an accelerated reference frame ( see @xcite ) , then we have to presuppose corresponding hypotheses for the measurement of the electric and magnetic fields , the electric charge , etc . in this way",
    ", we arrive at the _ hypothesis of locality _ that has been extensively investigated @xcite .",
    "replacing the curved worldline of the accelerated observer by its instantaneous tangent vector is reasonable if the intrinsic spacetime scales of the phenomena under consideration are negligibly small compared to the characteristic acceleration scales that determine the curvature of the worldline ; otherwise , the past worldline of the observer must be taken into account .",
    "this would then result in a nonlocal electrodynamics for accelerated systems .",
    "nonlocal constitutive relations have been studied in the _ phenomenological _ electrodynamics of continuous media for a long time @xcite . in basic field theories ,",
    "form - factor nonlocality has been the subject of extensive investigations .",
    "the main problem with such field theoretical approaches has been that they defy quantization .",
    "a review of nonlocal quantum field theories and their insurmountable difficulties has been given by marnelius @xcite .",
    "the present work is concerned with a benign form of nonlocality that is induced by the acceleration of the observer .",
    "the hypothesis of locality refers directly to _ acceleration _ ; therefore , one can develop an alternative approach in which the acceleration enters as the decisive quantity .",
    "this type of nonlocality , if it refers to time , would involve persistent memory effects .",
    "materials with memory have been extensively studied .",
    "however , we are interested in the `` material '' vacuum  and in this context our paper is devoted to a comparison of two models involving acceleration - induced nonlocality .",
    "the observational basis of the special theory of relativity generally involves measuring devices that are accelerated ; for instance , static laboratory devices on the earth participate in its proper rotation .",
    "the standard extension of lorentz invariance to accelerated observers in minkowski spacetime is based on the hypothesis of locality , namely , the assumption that an accelerated observer is locally equivalent to a momentarily comoving inertial observer .",
    "the worldline of an accelerated observer in minkowski spacetime is curved and this curvature depends on the observer s translational and rotational acceleration scales .",
    "the hypothesis of locality is thus reasonable if the curvature of the worldline could be ignored , i.e.  if the phenomena under consideration have intrinsic scales that are negligible as compared to the acceleration scales of the observer .",
    "the accelerated observer passes through a continuous infinity of hypothetical comoving inertial observers along its worldline ; therefore , to go beyond the hypothesis of locality , it appears natural to relate the measurements of an accelerated observer to the class of instantaneous comoving inertial observers .",
    "consider , for instance , an electromagnetic radiation field @xmath0 in an inertial frame and an accelerated observer carrying an _ orthonormal tetrad frame _",
    "@xmath1 along its worldline .",
    "here @xmath2 is its proper time , the latin indices @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ,  , which run from 0 to 3 , refer to spacetime coordinates ( holonomic indices ) , while the greek indices @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ,  , which run from @xmath9 to @xmath10 , refer to ( anholonomic ) frame indices , and we choose the signature @xmath11 .",
    "the hypothesis of locality implies that the field as measured by the observer is the projection of @xmath0 upon the frame of the instantaneously comoving inertial observer , i.e. @xmath12 on the other hand , measuring the properties of the radiation field would necessitate finite intervals of time and space that would then involve the curvature of the worldline .",
    "the most general _ linear _ relationship between the measurements of the accelerated observer and the class of comoving inertial observers consistent with causality is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the _ field actually measured _ , @xmath15 is the instant at which the acceleration begins and the kernel @xmath16 is expected to depend on the acceleration of the observer .",
    "a nonlocal theory of accelerated observers has been developed @xcite based on the assumptions that ( i ) @xmath16 is a convolution - type kernel , i.e.  it depends only on @xmath17 , and ( ii ) the radiation field never stands completely still with respect to an accelerated observer .",
    "the latter is a generalization of a consequence of lorentz invariance for inertial observers to all observers .    in the space of continuous functions ,",
    "the volterra integral equation ( [ non - local1 ] ) provides a unique relationship between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "it is possible to express ( [ non - local1 ] ) as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the resolvent kernel and if @xmath16 is a convolution - type kernel as we have assumed in ( i ) , then so is @xmath21 , i.e.@xmath22 . assumption ( ii ) then implies that @xmath23 where @xmath21 and @xmath24 are @xmath25 matrices and @xmath24 is defined by ( [ field ] ) expressed as @xmath26 in the six - vector notation . here",
    "@xmath27 denotes the field as referred to the anholonomic frame .",
    "this nonlocal theory , which is consistent with all observational data available at present , has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the path of an observer in space moving with constant angular velocity around the @xmath28-axis for @xmath29 .",
    "it proves interesting to provide a concrete example of the nonlocal relationship ( [ non - local1 ] ) .",
    "imagine an observer that moves uniformly in the inertial frame along the @xmath30-axis with speed @xmath31 for @xmath32 and for @xmath33 rotates with uniform angular speed @xmath34 about the @xmath28-axis on a circle of radius @xmath35 , @xmath36 , in the @xmath37-plane , see fig.1 . in this case",
    ", @xmath38 in @xmath39 coordinates with @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 is the azimuthal angle in the @xmath37-plane and @xmath8 is the lorentz factor .",
    "using six - vector notation , @xmath42 one can show that with respect to the tetrad frame ( [ rotframe ] ) @xmath43\\,d\\tau'\\,,\\\\ \\label{explicit2 } \\boldsymbol{\\cal b}&=&\\boldsymbol{\\hat{b}}+\\int\\limits_{\\tau_0}^\\tau\\left [ \\frac{\\boldsymbol{a}}{c}\\times\\boldsymbol{\\hat{e}}(\\tau ' ) + \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\times\\boldsymbol{\\hat{b}}(\\tau')\\right]\\,d\\tau'\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the constant centripetal acceleration of the observer and @xmath45 is its constant angular velocity .",
    "these quantities can be expressed with respect to the triad @xmath46 as @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "for an arbitrary accelerated observer , we expect that the relations analogous to ( [ explicit1 ] ) and ( [ explicit2 ] ) would be much more complicated .",
    "imagine now a general congruence of accelerated observers such that relations similar to ( [ non - local1 ] ) and ( [ non - local2 ] ) hold for each member of the congruence .",
    "the requirement that the electromagnetic field @xmath0 ( or @xmath19 ) satisfy maxwell s equations would then imply , via ( [ non - local2 ] ) , that the field @xmath14 would satisfy certain complicated integro - differential equations , which could then be regarded as the nonlocal maxwell equations for @xmath14 . instead of this system",
    ", we give here a different , but analogous , acceleration - induced nonlocal electrodynamics and study some of its main properties .",
    "the electrodynamics of charged particles and flux lines , see @xcite and the references cited therein , involves the electromagnetic field strength @xmath19that is defined via the lorentz force law and is directly related to the conservation law of magnetic flux  as well as the electromagnetic excitation @xmath49 that is directly related to the electric charge conservation .",
    "the corresponding maxwell equations are metric - free and in ricci calculus in arbitary frames read ( cf .",

    "in particular , it is possible to develop a nonlocal _ ansatz _ based on a generalization of along the lines suggested by obukhov and hehl @xcite @xmath55 where the kernel @xmath56 corresponds to the response of the medium and @xmath57 , @xmath58 , are the lagrange coordinates of the medium .    as an alternative to mashhoon s model but along the same line of thought , see equation",
    ", one can develop an acceleration - induced nonlocal constitutive relation in vacuum via equation by using the ansatz , @xmath59\\,d\\tau ' \\big]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integral is over the worldline of an accelerated observer in minkowski spacetime as before . here",
    "the response of the `` medium '' is simply given by the levi - civita connection of the accelerated observer in vacuum and the local constitutive relation is recovered for _ inertial _ observers .",

    "we explore the consequences of the new ansatz for a general accelerated observer in minkowski spacetime .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite , and the references cited therein , that the _ orthonormal _ frame @xmath62 of an arbitrary observer with local 3-acceleration @xmath44 and local 3-angular velocity @xmath45 reads @xmath63\\,,\\nonumber\\\\    e_{a}&=&\\partial_{\\overline{a}}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the barred coordinates are the standard normal coordinates adapted to the worldline of the accelerated observer .",
    "the coframe @xmath64 can be computed by inversion .",
    "we find @xmath65 in the @xmath66-decomposition of spacetime , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are known as _",
    "lapse function _ and _ shift vector _ , respectively . the frame and the coframe",
    "are orthonormal .",
    "the metric reads as follows : @xmath69\\,\\left(dx^{\\overline{0}}\\right)^2\\\\ & &   -2\\,\\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}{c }   \\times{\\overline{\\boldsymbol{x}}}\\right)_{\\overline{a}}\\ ,   dx^{\\overline{0}}\\ ,   dx^{\\overline{a}}-\\delta_{{\\overline{a}}\\,{\\overline{b}}}dx^{\\overline{a } }   dx^{\\overline{b}}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .    starting with the coframe , we can read off the connection coefficients ( for vanishing torsion ) by using cartan s first structure equation @xmath73 with @xmath74 . by construction , the connection projected in spacelike directions vanishes , since we have spatial cartesian laboratory coordinates .",
    "thus we are left with the following nonvanishing connection coefficients : @xmath75 the first index in @xmath76 is holonomic , whereas the second and third indices are anholonomic .",
    "if we transform the first index , by means of the frame coefficients @xmath77 , into an anholonomic one , then we find the totally anholonomic connection coefficients as follows : @xmath78 in general , of course , the translational acceleration @xmath44 and the angular velocity @xmath45 are _ functions of time_.    let us return to ( [ kernel ] ) .",
    "if we study the electric sector of the theory , we find , because of ( [ conn1 ] ) , @xmath79\\,\\ ] ] or @xmath80d\\tau'\\,.\\ ] ] similarly , for the magnetic sector , the corresponding relations read @xmath81\\,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] or @xmath82d\\tau'\\,,\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "clearly , for _ constant _ @xmath44 and @xmath45 our nonlocal relations ( [ d2 ] ) and ( [ h2 ] ) are the same as and provided we identify @xmath83 with @xmath84 , i.e.  we postulate that the field actually measured by the accelerated observer is the excitation @xmath83 .",
    "this agreement does not extend to the case of _ _ non__uniform acceleration , however , as will be demonstrated in the next section .",
    "to show that the new ansatz is different from mashhoon s ansatz for the case of nonuniform acceleration even when we identify @xmath83 with @xmath84 , we proceed via contradiction .",
    "that is , let us assume that @xmath85 and hence from and @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "here @xmath89 , @xmath90 , is a @xmath91 matrix that is proportional to the operator of infinitesimal rotations about the @xmath92-axis .",
    "we must now prove that in general @xmath93 given by can not be the resolvent kernel corresponding to @xmath94 given by .    to this end , consider an observer that is accelerated at @xmath95 and note that for kernels of faltung type in equations and we can write @xmath96 respectively , where @xmath97 is the laplace transform of @xmath98 defined by @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the unit @xmath25 matrix . hence , the relation between @xmath16 and @xmath21 may be expressed as @xmath101    fig.2 .",
    "the acceleration of an observer that is uniformly accelerated only during a finite interval from @xmath102 to @xmath103 .",
    "imagine now an observer that is at rest on the @xmath28-axis for @xmath104 and undergoes linear acceleration along the @xmath28-axis at @xmath102 such that @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "that is , the acceleration is turned off at @xmath103 and thereafter the observer moves with uniform speed @xmath109 along the @xmath28-axis to infinity .",
    "thus in , @xmath110 and @xmath111 . on the other hand , one can show that can be expressed in this case as @xmath112 where @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .",
    "here we have set @xmath116 and @xmath117 it is now possible to work out explicitly and conclude that for @xmath118 we must have @xmath119 these relations imply that @xmath120 on the other hand , we have @xmath121 and @xmath122\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we consider only the region @xmath123 in which @xmath124 and @xmath125 remain finite for @xmath126 . comparing ( [ ys ] ) with @xmath127 we find that , contrary to ( [ ys0 ] ) , they do not agree except in the @xmath128 limit ( see fig.3 ) .",

    ", one finds a rather complicated implicit nonlocal constitutive law .",
    "the maxwell equations expressed in terms of the excitations @xmath131 and field strengths @xmath132 remain the same , a fact which is significant since otherwise the conservation laws of electric charge and magnetic flux would be violated .    in this paper , we have developed an alternative nonlocal constitutive ansatz within the framework of charge & flux electrodynamics such that the nonlocality is induced by the acceleration of the observer in a similar way as in mashhoon s model .",
