    "general relativity asserts the equivalence between inertial and gravitational effects .",
    "however , our intuition often relies on newtonian ideas .",
    "by re - introducing inertial forces through the consideration of relative motion , we can sometimes better interpret the behavior of geodesic or accelerated orbits in certain types of spacetimes .",
    "most of the work done in introducing such a point of view has focused explicitly on transverse acceleration effects associated with centrifugal and coriolis - like forces in the relativistic setting .",
    "the present investigation shows how these ideas are affected by uniform `` linear '' acceleration , for which the simplest nonflat exact solution of einstein s vacuum equations is the c metric .",
    "this metric represents the exterior field of a uniformly accelerated spherical gravitational source and it can also be thought of as a nonlinear superposition of the ( flat ) rindler spacetime associated with a uniformly accelerated family of observers and the schwarzschild solution representing a static black hole .",
    "while the c metric spacetime is globally pathological and hence of limited value for physical interpretation , locally it can give some insight into the effects of acceleration of the spacetime `` on transversely accelerated world lines similar to the study of the effects on such world lines of the rotation of the spacetime '' due to the rotation of a kerr black hole , for example .",
    "timelike geodesics were first discussed by pravda and pravdov@xcite using various coordinate systems distinct from boyer - lindquist - like coordinates .",
    "they constructed an effective potential , whose properties allowed them to distinguish three distinct types of timelike geodesics corresponding to particles which ( a ) fall into the black hole horizon , ( b ) cross the acceleration horizon and reach future infinity , or ( c ) spin around the @xmath1-axis , co - accelerating with the black hole and then reaching future infinity .",
    "they focused only on geodesics of the third type ( circular geodesics ) and numerically investigated the stability of timelike as well as null geodesics .    in the present paper",
    "we use the frenet - serret formalism in boyer - linquist - like coordinates to study the motion of test particles along both geodesic and accelerated circular orbits and discuss the main geometrical and kinematical features of accelerated orbits with certain special geometrical properties .",
    "comparisons with the limiting cases of the schwarzschild and rindler spacetimes are carefully explored .",
    "the vacuum c metric is a boost - rotation symmetric static spacetime of petrov type d belonging to the weyl class of solutions of the einstein equations@xcite and can be interpreted as the field of two black holes which are uniformly accelerated in opposite directions .",
