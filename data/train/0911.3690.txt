    "the results differ from each other by several orders of magnitude , changing from a few minutes  @xcite to many hours  @xcite .",
    "hence , new experimental and theoretical investigations are required .",
    "a special interest to the nuclear transition from the isomeric state to the ground state is motivated by a possibility to build a superprecise nuclear clock  @xcite and very high sensitivity to the effects of possible temporal variation of the fundamental constants including the fine structure constant @xmath14 , strong interaction and quark mass  @xcite .",
    "laser cooling of the @xmath15th@xmath3 ion was recently reported by campbell _",
    "_ in their paper  @xcite .",
    "this was the first time when a multiply charged ion has been laser cooled . as a next step",
    "this experimental group plans to investigate the nuclear transition between the isomeric and the ground state in a trapped , cold @xmath2th@xmath3 ion . motivated by this experimental progress",
    "we have considered @xmath2th@xmath3 ion and calculated the transition probability of the @xmath2th nucleus from its lowest - energy isomeric state @xmath0th to the ground state @xmath1th due to the electronic bridge ( eb ) process .",
    "our calculations , based on the value of @xmath10 = 7.6 ev , showed that if the electrons are in their ground state the ratio of the probability of the eb process , @xmath4 , to the probability of the nuclear radiative @xmath16 transition , @xmath17 , is of the order of ( a few)@xmath18 .",
    "if the valence electron is in the metastable @xmath19 state then @xmath20 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_gf ]",
    "we present the general formalism describing the eb process .",
    "section  [ sec_mc ] is devoted to the method of calculation of the properties of th@xmath3 . in section  [ sec_rd ]",
    "we discuss the results of calculations and section  [ sec_c ] contains concluding remarks . if not stated otherwise the atomic units ( @xmath21 and the speed of light @xmath22 ) are used .",
    "the 7.6 ev transition in @xmath2th is the m1 transition with the amplitude of a fraction of the nuclear magneton @xmath23 .",
    "an amplitude of an allowed electric dipole transition of the valence electron , @xmath24 1 au , is @xmath25 times larger . if there is an electron excited state close to the energy of the nuclear excitation , an energy transfer from the nuclear excited state to the electron excited state accompanied by the electron electric dipole transition to a lower state ,",
    "may radically decrease the lifetime of the nuclear isomeric state .",
    "even if there is no an electron state very close to the nuclear excited state , the electron bridge process produces significant effect .",
    "the eb process can be represented by two feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : eb ] .        in the following",
    "we assume that the initial @xmath26 and the final @xmath27 electronic states are of opposite parity and a real photon which is emitted or absorbed is the electric dipole photon .",
    "the probability of the eb process in this case is much larger than in the case when the @xmath26 and the @xmath27 states are of the same parity .",
    "therefore , the eb process can be effectively treated as the electric dipole @xmath28 transition of the electron accompanied by the nuclear transition from its isomeric state to the ground state . denoting by @xmath29 the amplitude of this `` generalized '' electric dipole transition and assuming that the initial and the final states are fixed , we obtain @xmath30 where the indices @xmath26 , @xmath31 , and @xmath27 denote initial , intermediate , and final electronic states , correspondingly ; and the indices @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the ground state and the isomeric state of the nucleus .",
    "@xmath34 are the atomic energies , @xmath35 are the nuclear energies of the isomeric ( ground ) states , and @xmath36 are the widths of the intermediate states which may be neglected in the case of @xmath2th .",
    "the operator @xmath37 is the electron electric dipole moment operator and @xmath38 is the hyperfine coupling hamiltonian , which may be represented as a sum over multipole nuclear moments @xmath39 of rank @xmath40 combined with the even - parity electronic coupling operators @xmath41 of the same rank as @xmath42    neglecting the hyperfine splitting of levels , we can represent the total wave function as a product of the nuclear wave function and the electronic wave function .",

    "the only difference is that the matrix element ( me ) of the nuclear moment @xmath53 here is non - diagonal ( there is also a few per cent correction due to variation of the electron magnetic field inside the nucleus ) .",

    "the physical meaning of this is as follows .",
    "it is known that a neutral atom is not affected by an external electric field .",
    "it means that an effective electric field acting on the nucleus is equal to zero because the electrons completely screen the external electric field . respectively , gradient of electrostatic potential created by the electrons at the nucleus is very large . for a static case ( in our consideration it corresponds to @xmath106 )",
    "a similar phenomenon was investigated in  @xcite where magnetic - dipole shielding factors and electric - quadrupole antishielding factors were calculated for a number of atoms and ions .",
    "for instance , for such a heavy atom as hg , the latter was shown to be four orders of magnitude larger than the former .",
    "note also that the probability of , so called , `` elastic '' process ( when the final state is the same as the initial state ) is much smaller , since instead of @xmath52 transitions we have to consider @xmath16 ( or @xmath95 ) transitions . but",
    "the probability of an allowed @xmath16 transition is four orders of magnitude smaller than the probability of an allowed @xmath52 transition .",

    "at the first stage we have solved dirac - hartree - fock ( dhf ) equations  @xcite in @xmath110 approximation .",
    "it means that the dhf equations were solved self - consistently for the core electrons .",
    "after that we determined valence orbitals for several low - lying states from the frozen - core dhf equations .",

    ". we will refer to this approach as the dhf+@xmath115 formalism .",
    "together with the effective hamiltonian @xmath116 we introduce effective ( `` dressed '' ) electric - dipole operator @xmath117 and operators @xmath118 acting in the model space of valence electrons .",
    "these operators were obtained within the relativistic random - phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite which describes a shielding of the externally applied electric field by the core electrons .",

    "only excitations of the valence electron to higher virtual orbitals are included in the intermediate - state wave function @xmath120 due to the presence of @xmath123 in eq .",

    "we can directly sum over _ all _ intermediate states using the single - electron wave functions found at the stage of constructing the basis set .",
    "an accuracy of this approach is comparable to the accuracy of the more refined method of solving the inhomogeneous equation .",
    "the reason is that , despite a non - resonant character of the eb process in @xmath2th@xmath3 for @xmath124 ev there are only a few intermediate states in eqs .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) , ( [ g12 ] ) , and ( [ g2 ] ) ( whose denominators are small ) that give a dominant contribution to @xmath4 .",

    "( [ g1 ] ) , ( [ g12 ] ) , and ( [ g2 ] ) the states @xmath125 or @xmath126 are allowed .",
    "this is due to that the me of the nuclear moment @xmath53 is non - diagonal and , correspondingly , the diagonal mes of the electronic operator @xmath127 should be included into consideration .",
    "note that the diagonal mes of the operators @xmath127 are large and the inclusion of these contributions to @xmath4 significantly affects the final value of the latter .",
    "to check the quality of the constructed wave functions we have calculated the energy levels for a number of low - lying states and compared them with the experimental data . some details regarding the energy levels computation",

    "an agreement between theoretical and experimental energy levels is rather poor .",
    "the inclusion of the core - valence correlations restores the correct order of the states and significantly improves the agreement with the experimental energy levels .",
