    "bound states arising in a variety of condensed matter systems were explored intensively over the last decade or so .",
    "some of these states such as majorana bound states ( mbss),@xcite fractional fermions , @xcite and parafermions@xcite are attractive due to their potential use in topological quantum computation schemes owing to their non - abelian statistics .",
    "@xcite moreover , mbss can be transformed into fractional fermions by tuning parameters from the topological phase to the trivial phase.@xcite at the same time , the possibility of generating mbss together with fermionic bound states ( fbss ) simultaneously , in the topological phase , has not received much attention so far .    in this work",
    "we explore such a scenario in non - uniform rashba nanowires coupled to an @xmath0-wave superconductor in the presence of a magnetic field in the topological regime ( _ i.e. _ with zeeman energy being dominant over the superconducting pairing ) .",
    "the considered non - uniformity is in the spin orbit interaction ( soi ) along the wire .",
    "specifically , we consider a situation where the soi vector changes its direction along the nanowire axis creating an interface between two nanowire sections with different soi vector directions . in this case",
    ", we find that additional fbss localized at such soi interfaces emerge .",
    "in contrast to zero - energy mbss localized at the nanowire ends , the energy of these fbss crucially depends on the soi vector rotation angle and can take any value inside the proximity induced bulk gap . in the particular case , when the soi has a sharp discontinuity , _",
    "i.e. _ , changes abruptly , such that the soi vector rapidly rotates by the angle @xmath1 , or , equivalently , changes its sign , the system possesses an additional symmetry that constrains the fbss to be zero - energy states.@xcite however , this degeneracy between the fbs being filled and unfilled is not robust against small perturbations . for instance , if the rotation angle deviates from @xmath2 , the fbs energy levels smoothly shifts away from zero and eventually disappears from the gap into the continuum at @xmath3 .",
    "the localization length of such states is the larger the closer the energy level is to the gap edge .    in addition , we also study the situation of the soi vector rotation taking place over a finite region @xmath4 of the nanowire , which could be comparable to the fermi wavelength @xmath5 and the fbss localization length @xmath6 . as expected , if the soi vector rotates adiabatically , @xmath7 , the fbs energy level merges into the continuum , such that no fbss emerge at the interface .",
    "we emphasize that the fbss exist at the interface ( or junction ) between two sections where both of them are in the topological phase .",
    "this is in contrast to mbss , which exist at the interface between the topological and non - topological phase .    besides fundamental interest , the study of non - uniform soi is also important for practical implementations of topological quantum computing schemes based on mbss .",
    "@xcite the non - uniformity of the soi could be a result of a change in the direction of an electric field causing the rashba soi  @xcite or of a change in the direction of the crystallographic axes in systems with dresselhaus soi .",
    "@xcite such changes are likely to occur , for example , in @xmath8-junctions that underlay proposed schemes for braiding of mbss .",
    "@xcite    moreover , using the gauge equivalence in one - dimensional systems between rashba soi plus uniform magnetic field and a spatially rotating magnetic field but without soi,@xcite one can easily show that a spatial discontinuity in the soi in a hybrid rashba nanowire is equivalent to a _ domain wall _ in a hybrid rkky system with self - tuned topological phase.@xcite thus , here again , we can expect fbss to emerge simultaneously with mbss .",
    "if the rkky system , in addition , has an easy plane the domain walls are @xmath2-junctions , such that fbss can efficiently hybridize with mbss .",
    "this then raises the question whether such additional bound states could affect the properties of topological braiding schemes based on mbss or affect the decoherence of mbss themselves due to trapping and releasing of fermions in such fbss . here",
    ", we will not address this important issue further but instead will focus on the physics of such fbss and on the conditions under which they exist and what their behavior is as function of various system parameters .",

    "the two junctions are separated by a distance @xmath164 from each other such that the soi vector is given by @xmath165 here , we assume the double junction to be symmetric around @xmath17 such that the fbss are at the same energy at each of two soi - junctions in the limit of large @xmath166 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath167 .",
    "first , such a situation maximizes the degree of hybridization between them ( compare with the hybridization between fbss and mbss in fig .",
    "[ split ] ) .",
    "second , this allows us to go the limit of small separation , @xmath168 , where the effect of the soi - junctions effectively vanishes . in this limit",
    ", the nanowire becomes again spatially uniform , and thus the fbss will merge with the bulk states , see fig .",
    "[ junction ] . on the other hand , in the intermediate regime of @xmath169 , the two overlapping fbss hybridize into symmetric and antisymmetric states with energies distinct from the ones obtained for a single soi - junction .",
    "the energy splitting between the two hybridized states depends on the system parameters as shown in fig .",
    "[ junction ] .    in the regime of strong soi , the components of the fbs wavefunction [ see , for example , eq . ( [ strong_wave ] ) ]",
    "not only exponentially decay away from the soi - junction but also oscillate with the wavevector @xmath170 . as a consequence ,",
    "the overlap between the two fbs wavefunctions , and thus the splitting between them , is also an oscillating function , see figs .",
    "[ junction]a and [ junction]b .",
    "moreover , as expected , these friedel oscillations are highly sensitive to the width @xmath166 and get stronger as the double junction shrinks",
    ". the amplitude of the oscillations can become so large that the fbs energy could even go back to zero .    in the opposite regime of weak soi , however , the structure of the fbs wavefunction [ see eq .",
    "( [ weak_wave ] ) ] is such that friedel oscillations are nearly absent .",
    "this is in good agreement with the numerical results presented in figs .",
    "[ junction]c and [ junction]d .",
    "the two hybridized fbs have almost the same energy and smoothly merge with the bulk states with vanishing width @xmath166 .",
    "in contrast to the previous sections , in which the soi vector changes its direction abruptly at @xmath17 , in this section , the soi vector rotates smoothly as function of position @xmath9 . without loss of generality , we assume that the soi vector rotation angle @xmath171 is given by @xmath172 where @xmath4 is a characteristic length that determines the adiabaticity of the soi vector rotation .",
    "the choice of the linear change of the phase as a function of the coordinate @xmath9 is motivated by the fact that in this particular case we can find explicit eigenstates of the effective hamiltonian @xmath173 in the regime of weak soi [ see eqs .",
    "( [ weak_kin ] ) and ( [ weak_sc ] ) ] .",
    "two decaying eigenstates in the left and right sections are given by eq .",
    "( [ phil ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ phir ] ) correspondingly . in the central section of the nanowire @xmath174 , there are four eigenstates @xmath175 where the localization lengths are given by @xmath176 here , the label @xmath177 takes the values @xmath178 .",
    "we also introduced the new notation    @xmath179     as numerically found in the tight - binding model [ see eqs .",
    "( [ tb2 ] ) - ( [ tb1 ] ) ] .",
    "the chain consists of @xmath180 sites .",
    "the parameters are fixed to be @xmath181 , @xmath73 , and @xmath84 , and @xmath182 .",
    "the soi vector rotates in total by the angle @xmath1 [ ( a ) ] and @xmath130 [ ( b ) ] .",
    "the mbss ( red dots ) are not affected by the width of the soi .",
    "in contrast , the fbs energy ( blue dots ) is sensitive to @xmath66 .",
    "the smoother the variation the closer is the fbs energy to the edge of the gap ( black dots ) . in general , if the soi variation is smooth on the fermi wavelength scale @xmath5 ( here , @xmath183 ) , the fbs level merges with the bulk . ]    after finding the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , we follow standard procedure and impose the boundary conditions on the wavefunction @xmath184 and its derivative at the two interfaces @xmath185 where @xmath184 is defined as a linear combination @xmath186 if eqs .",
    "( [ bo_1 ] ) - ( [ bo_2 ] ) can be satisfied at some energy @xmath101 , @xmath187 , for non - zero values for the coefficients @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 , then there is a bound state of the energy @xmath101 localized at the interface @xmath192 .",
    "the general expression for the bound state energy is too involved to be reproduced here , and , instead , we show only a limiting case .",
    "we consider a limit in which the soi vector rotates over distances much smaller than the fermi wavelength @xmath67 , @xmath193 , and , thus , much smaller than the localization length @xmath160 .",
    "this limit is the closest to the case of an abrupt change considered above [ see eq . ( [ abrupt_weak_soi ] ) ] .",
    "we find that there is a trend to the repulsion of the energy levels from the zero energy towards to the bulk gap , see fig .",
    "[ pi2 ] . in particular ,",
    "the twofold degeneracy of zero - energy states at @xmath1 gets lifted .",
    "the energy spectrum is given by @xmath194 all these finding are consistent with our numerical results , see fig .",
    "the energy level disappears in the bulk if the soi vector rotates more slowly than any characteristic length in the problem , @xmath195 .",
    "we have studied fbss in nanowires with a spatially non - uniform soi and found that they can coexist with mbss in the topological phase . in particular",
    ", we explored the dependence of their energy on the rotation angle @xmath64 of the soi vector along the nanowire . in general",
    ", the fbs state can assume any energy value inside the gap depending on @xmath64 , in contrast to mbss which are truly stable and remain at zero energy as long as the mbss do not overlap .",
    "specifically , if the soi vector rotates abruptly , the fbs energy level moves from zero at @xmath1 to the gap energy at @xmath3 .",
    "however , if the soi rotates adiabatically the fbss are absent ( merged with the bulk states ) .",
    "non - uniform soi with fbss can arise from varying rashba soi induced by varying electric field directions along the wire ,  @xcite from dresselhaus soi  @xcite due to discontinuities in the crystallographic structure ( like in @xmath8-junctions of wires ) , or from domain walls in rotating zeeman fields  @xcite or rkky systems  @xcite proposed for mbss . in our work we focussed on solid - state systems as mentioned above .",
    "however , we note that the effects discussed here can also be implemented in cold atom and optical lattice systems  @xcite where topological phases in one - dimensional systems of the type considered here have been proposed .",
    "@xcite    next , under certain conditions , fbss can interfere with topological quantum computing schemes which have been proposed for mbss in wire networks .",
    "@xcite as an outlook for further work , let us mention briefly three such scenarios in a qualitative manner .",
    "first , it was shown that non - overlapping mbss can hybridize via the medium , _ e.g _ via the bulk superconductor which induces the proximity gap in the nanowire .",
    "@xcite similarly , fbss could also serve as an effective mediator of hybridization between two distant mbss which can have wavefunction overlap via the fermionic intragap state .",
    "however , this coupling is efficient only for fbss at energies close to zero ( see fig . [ split ] ) since otherwise the overlap of wavefunctions is exponentially suppressed .",
    "second , the fbss can trap quasiparticles and contribute to the decoherence time of logical qubits based on mbss.@xcite at any finite temperature , quasiparticle excitations in the bulk superconductor @xcite tend to minimize their energy by occupying lower energy states such as the ones , for instance , provided by the fbs described in this work .",
    "consider now a pair of well - separated mbss that is filled with a quasiparticle .",
    "for braiding one envisions to move the mbss through the wire .",
    "@xcite in particular , if a mbs now is moved through a nanowire section that hosts a fbs filled with a trapped quasiparticle , then there is a finite probability that the quasiparticle shared by the mbs pair and the quasiparticle localized in the fbs overlap and form a cooper pair which then is absorbed by the superconducting condensate . as a result , the parity of the mbs subsystem changes and thus the coherence of the logical qubit based on mbss is lost .",
    "third , if the fbs sits at zero energy , it can be represented as two mbss .",
    "if one additional mbs is passing through this fbs ( during a braiding operation ) , it might not be guarantueed in general that these two mbs forming the fbs will return to their initial state at the end of the operation , with the third mbs again being far away from the fbs .",
    "if this is not the case , then one might expect that the braiding will be affected non - trivially by the presence of such a fbs .",
    "this then might be in contrast to the situation when all ( three ) mbs are moved together .",
    "@xcite however , this question requires further investigation which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "next , we also considered symmetric double junctions and showed that they contain double fbs that can hybridize .",
    "this behavior is very much reminiscent of double quantum dots ,  @xcite which suggests that such double fbs , being effectively spinless , can serve as a promising platform for conventional charge qubits . indeed , as we have seen , the amount of charge of an fbs is rather small , especially in the weak soi regime .",
    "this implies that the direct coupling to electric field fluctuations due to _ e.g. _ external voltage gates will be correspondingly small . on the other hand , fluctuations of a rashba soi field",
    "will also induce level fluctuations of the fbs and thus act as dephasing source .",
    "this might be less the case for double junctions induced by non - uniform dresselhaus soi which is independent of gates .",
    "nevertheless , these considerations suggests that such charge qubits , embedded in a topological superconductor , might be rather well protected against environmental noise and , thus , enjoy unusually large dephasing times , especially the closer their energy is to zero .",
    "finally , the presence and location of the fbs can serve as a detection tool of possible discontinuities of the soi , whereby a transport measurement of the type discussed in refs .",
    "can reveal the energy of the fbs and thus the rotation angle of the soi - junction .    to conclude , the understanding of fbss is not only interesting on its own , but such bound states can also have a variety of interesting effects and applications which deserve further exploration .",
    "it also seems worthwhile to search for them experimentally .",
