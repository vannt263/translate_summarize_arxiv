    "neutrinos can not be detected directly , because they do not ionize the materials they are passing through , and hence neutrino detectors are based on neutrino - nucleus interactions .",
    "thus , a correct understanding of these interactions is crucial to minimize systematic uncertainties in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "current and upcoming neutrino experiments ( sciboone , miniboone , t2k , miner@xmath0a , minos , lbne , microboone ,  ) to measure oscillation effects and neutrino interaction cross sections are / will be mostly sensitive to neutrino energies up to 10 gev . in this talk , we present results from a microscopic model  @xcite limited to three - momentum and energy transfers below 1.2 gev .",

    "the black contours show the location of the genuine qe events , while the white ones show lines of constant three - momentum transfer from 0.2 to 1.2 gev.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "thanks to the miniboone @xmath1 puzzle  @xcite , the theoretical understanding of the so called ccqe - like reactions ( cc quasi - elastic neutrino - nucleus processes that do not produce a pion in the final state ) at intermediate neutrino energies ( @xmath2 gev ) has experienced an enormous boost in the recent years  @xcite .",
    "the absolute values of the ccqe cross section reported in  @xcite were too large as compared to the consensus of theoretical predictions for the qe contribution  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the cross section per nucleon on @xmath3c was clearly larger than for free nucleons , and a fit , using a relativistic fermi gas model , to the data led to an axial mass , @xmath4 gev  @xcite much larger than the previous world average ( @xmath5 1.03 gev ) .",
    "the inclusive cross section for the process @xmath6 is determined by the @xmath7 gauge boson selfenergy in the nuclear medium  @xcite , and in particular for the different modes in which it can be absorbed . in the case of genuine qe events ,",
    "the gauge boson @xmath7 is absorbed by just one nucleon , which together with a lepton is emitted ( see figure 1 in ref .",
    "however , the qe - like sample includes also multinucleon events where the gauge boson is absorbed by two interacting nucleons ( in the many body language , this amounts to the excitation of a 2p2h nuclear component ) .",
    "the consideration of the 2p2h contributions allows to describe  @xcite the miniboone ccqe - like flux averaged double differential cross section @xmath8  @xcite with values of @xmath1 around 1 gev .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig:1 ] , where we also show results for antineutrinos .",
    "this is reassuring from the theoretical point of view and more satisfactory than the situation envisaged by some other works that described these ccqe - like data in terms of a larger value of @xmath1 of around 1.31.4 gev ( see the discussion in @xcite ) , difficult to accommodate with our current knowledge on the nucleon axial radius .",
    "however , not only multinucleon mechanisms , but also rpa corrections turn out to be essential to obtain axial masses consistent with the world average .",
    "this can be appreciated in the left panel of figure  [ fig:2 ] , where we see that rpa strongly decreases the cross section at low energies , while multinucleon mechanisms accumulate their contribution at low muon energies and compensate for that depletion .",
    "therefore , the final picture is that of a delicate balance between a dominant single nucleon scattering , corrected by collective effects , and other mechanisms that involve directly two or more nucleons .",
    "both effects can be mimicked by using a large @xmath1 value ( red lines in the neutrino panels of figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "because of the multinucleon mechanisms , the neutrino energy reconstruction based on the qe kinematics is not totally reliable  @xcite .",
    "the energy of the neutrino that has originated a cc event is unknown , and it is common to define a reconstructed neutrino ( @xmath9 ) energy obtained from the measured angle and three - momentum of the outgoing charged lepton .",
    "it corresponds to the energy of a neutrino that emits a lepton and a gauge boson that is being absorbed by a nucleon at rest .",
    "each event contributing to the flux averaged cross section defines unambiguously a value of @xmath9 , however the actual energy of the neutrino that has produced the event will not be exactly @xmath10 .",
    "thus , for each @xmath9 , there exists a distribution of true neutrino energies that could give rise to events whose outgoing charge lepton kinematics would lead to the given value of @xmath10 .",
    "for genuine qe events , this distribution is sufficiently peaked around the true neutrino energy to make the used algorithm accurate enough to study the neutrino oscillation phenomenon  @xcite or to extract neutrino flux unfolded ccqe cross sections from data @xcite . however , for 2p2h events included in the ccqe - like sample , there appears a long tail in the distribution of true energies associated to each @xmath9 that makes less reliable the qe based energy reconstruction procedure  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the unfolded ccqe - like cross section turns out not to be a very clean observable , since the unfolding procedure itself is model dependent and assumes that the events are purely qe . this is illustrated in the right panel of figure [ fig:2 ] , where different predictions from our model , together with the ccqe - like miniboone data are depicted . the unfolding procedure ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) does not appreciably distort the genuine qe events , however the situation is drastically different for the 2p2h contribution , and as result the miniboone unfolded cross section  @xcite exhibits an excess ( deficit ) of low ( high ) energy neutrinos , which is an artifact of the unfolding process that ignores multinucleon mechanisms .",
    "this systematic distortion of the energy spectrum will increase the uncertainty on the extracted oscillation signal .",
    "we have extended to 10 gev the results from the microscopic model .",
    "we find  @xcite , limiting the calculation to three momentum transfers less than 1.2 gev , the 2p2h mechanisms produce a two dimensional distribution in momentum and energy transfer that is roughly constant as a function of energy ( figure [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the 2p2h cross section scales approximately with the number of nucleons for isoscalar nuclei , and becomes around 25% ( 33% ) of the qe cross section for 3 gev neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) . the distortion of the energy and @xmath11 spectra using the qe kinematic reconstruction , large at 1 gev and below ,",
    "steadily decreases as a function of the neutrino energy . when confronted with the miner@xmath0a data  @xcite , the model has the qualitative features and magnitude to provide a reasonable agreement ( figure [ fig:4 ] ) .",
