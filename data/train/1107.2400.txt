    "we have been living exceptional times in neutrino physics .",
    "neutrino mixings and masses have been substantiated by a plethora of oscillation experiments which favor the standard three flavor mixing scheme .",
    "solar  @xcite and atmospheric  @xcite neutrino experiments have established two fairly large mixing angles and two distinct mass squared differences which today are rather precisely determined by reactor  @xcite and accelerator experiments  @xcite .",
    "recently t2k  @xcite has announced that their data provides indication of a non - zero , and perhaps far from negligible , value of @xmath2 , supported also by minos  @xcite , opening the auspicious possibility to access cp violation in the leptonic sector by current or near future experiments .",
    "while all the neutrino data mentioned above can be fitted very well into the standard picture of the three flavor neutrino scheme , there have been some data  @xcite which are not consistent with such a picture .",
    "first , the lsnd  @xcite experiment has observed an excess of @xmath3 events in the @xmath4 mode , which seemed to be supported by miniboone data  @xcite , indicating the presence of at least one species of the so - called sterile neutrinos .",
    "these neutrinos would have to be separated from the active neutrinos by a mass squared difference of @xmath5 ev@xmath6 .",
    "let us call this the lsnd / miniboone anomaly .",
    "likewise , calibrations of the gallium radiochemical solar neutrino detectors of gallex  @xcite and sage  @xcite experiments performed using intense portable neutrino radioactive sources , @xmath7cr by gallex and sage , and @xmath8ar by sage , observed some deficit of @xmath0 compared to what was expected , giving rise to the so - called _",
    "gallium anomaly_. the mean value of the ratios of the measured over predicted rates is @xmath9 which is smaller than unity by about 2.7 @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "this can also be explained by oscillation into sterile neutrinos with the similar mass squared difference which explains the lsnd / miniboone anomaly .",
    "more recently , a re - evaluation of the reactor @xmath11 flux  @xcite performed in order to prepare for the double chooz reactor experiment  @xcite resulted in an increase in the flux of 3.5% .",
    "while this increase has essentially no impact on the results of long baseline experiments such as kamland , it induces an average deficit of 5.7% in the observed event rates for short baseline ( @xmath12 m ) reactor neutrino experiments leading to the 98.6% cl deviation from unity , which has been referred to as the _ reactor antineutrino anomaly _  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that these three anomalies can be explained by a phenomenological @xmath13 model , where the oscillation scheme involves the three active neutrinos and one additional species of sterile neutrino . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was performed a global fit of the short baseline experiments ( but without ga data ) with sterile neutrinos and it was concluded that data can be fitted significantly better in a 3 + 2 model .    in the interim ,",
    "however , the lsnd / miniboone anomaly has diminished substantially .",
    "a more recent miniboone result , based on the @xmath14 pot , reduced the significance of the @xmath4 excess to 0.84 @xmath10  @xcite and very recently the harp - cdp group  @xcite presented new data on pion production that also decreased the significance of the lsnd excess from 3.8 to 2.9 @xmath10 .    in this paper , we will show that the two anomalies seen in the disappearance channels , the gallium and the antineutrino reactor ones , can be accommodated in a scenario where three right handed neutrinos propagate in a higher dimensional bulk , including a large compactified flat extra dimension  @xcite , and all standard model particles are confined to a 4-dimensional brane .",
    "the 3 bulk fermions have yukawa coupling with the higgs and the brane neutrinos leading to small dirac neutrino masses and mixings among active species and sterile kaluza - klein modes  @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the model presented here is significantly different from the phenomenological models studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in general",
    ", a 3+@xmath15 phenomenological model assumes that the three active neutrinos can mix with @xmath15 sterile species which implies that , in addition to the 2+@xmath15 mass squared differences , the ( 3+@xmath15)(2+@xmath15)/2 mixing angles and ( 2+@xmath15)(1+@xmath15)/2 phases are free parameters relevant for oscillation physics .",
    "therefore , the number of relevant parameters for the 3+@xmath15 model is significantly larger than that of the standard three flavor scheme .",
    "we , however , note that in the phenomenological approach , usually , the numbers of free parameters used in the fit are reduced to simplfy the analysis in thses models , as done in refs .",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand , besides providing an explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses @xcite , the free parameters of the led model described here that can have some impact on oscillation physics are the 3 mixing angles , one @xmath16 phase , the radius of the largest extra dimension and the neutrino mass scale . the mixing between the active neutrinos and the kk sterile modes",
    "is completely determined by these parameters .",
    "so , despite being ( innately ) conceptually more elaborated than the phenomenological @xmath17 models , the led model considered in this work is intrinsically much more constrained as a model , once it involves less free parameters @xcite .",
    "this alternative explanation is consistent with the results of the current terrestrial experiments such as chooz  @xcite , kamland  @xcite and minos  @xcite limits and seem to be consistent with solar  @xcite and atmospheric  @xcite oscillation as discussed in ref .",
    "however , the @xmath3 excess observed in the lsnd and miniboone experiments can not be explained by the scenario addressed here , and therefore we do not consider them in this work .",
    "0.2 cm     -3.0 cm    the large extra dimension ( led ) picture we will consider here is the one described in refs .  @xcite . there the 3 standard model ( sm ) left - handed flavor neutrinos fields @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , as well as all the other sm fields , are confined to propagate in a 4-dimensional brane , while 3 sm singlet fermion fields can propagate in a higher dimensional bulk , with at least two compactified extra dimensions . to retain simplicity",
    ", we will assume that one of these extra dimensions , compactified on a circle of radius @xmath20  @xcite , is however much larger than the size of the others so that in practice a 5-dimensional treatment is enough .",
    "the 3 bulk fermions have yukawa couplings with the sm higgs and the brane neutrinos ultimately leading to flavor oscillations driven by dirac masses , @xmath21 ( @xmath22=1,2 and 3 ) , and kaluza - klein ( kk ) masses @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , and mixings among active species and sterile modes . in this case",
    "the @xmath0 ( same as @xmath11 due to cpt conservation ) survival probability in vacuum can be written as  @xcite @xmath25 where the amplitude is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is given by , assuming @xmath28 and ignoring the terms of order @xmath29 and higher in the amplitude as well as @xmath30 and higher in the phase , @xmath31 .",
    "\\label{eq : amplitude}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath32 are the elements of the first row of the usual maki - sakata - nakagawa neutrino mixing matrix ( we use the standard parameterization found in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath33 is the neutrino energy , @xmath34 is the baseline distance , @xmath35 is the mass of the @xmath15-th kk mode .",
    "this survival probability depends on the neutrino mass hierarchy , for normal hierarchy ( nh ) we have @xmath36 and inverted hierarchy ( ih ) we have @xmath37 .",
    "clearly , as @xmath38 increases the differences between the hierarchies fade away and the masses become degenerate .",
    "so besides the usual oscillation parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , which are basically fixed by the data from the current oscillation experiments , led oscillations will be also driven by @xmath43 and @xmath38 which also have been constrained by experimental data  @xcite . throughout this work , even in the presence of led ,",
    "we consider , to a good approximation , the following true ( input ) values of the standard oscillation parameters determined by the three flavor analysis of experimental data : @xmath44 ev@xmath6 , @xmath45 = 0.31 , @xmath46 ev@xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath47 @xmath48 m , the led effect at short baselines is simply to promote @xmath49 , converting part of the @xmath0 signal into kk modes , producing a nearly energy independent depletion of the @xmath0 rates , and the same applies to antineutrinos . to illustrate this we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob - ee ] the survival probability for a few sets of led parameters as well as the radioactive source test experiments and reactor rates .",
    "how can one understand these results ?",
    "one can easily show that for the short - baseline experiments , to leading order , the averaged surviving probability with the led effect is @xmath50 ^ 2.\\ ] ] therefore , if @xmath51 @xmath48 m @xmath52 ev@xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ev or if @xmath56 @xmath48 m @xmath57 ev@xmath53 , @xmath58 ev @xmath59 or if @xmath60 @xmath48 m @xmath61 ev@xmath53 , @xmath62 ev @xmath63 , the survival probability can be estimated as @xmath64 , given respectively , @xmath5 0.96 , 0.93 , 0.99 .",
    "let us first look at the gallium anomaly .",
    "the radiochemical solar neutrino experiments gallex and sage have been calibrated with monoenergetic @xmath0 s from intense radioactive sources , which are captured by the reaction , @xmath65 gallex collaboration published the results of their measurements with two @xmath66 sources  @xcite .",
    "sage collaboration performed similar measurements with @xmath66 and also with @xmath67 sources  @xcite .",
    "they presented their results in terms of a ratio , @xmath68 , of the measured @xmath69 event rate over the predicted one using the predicted cross section for the reaction ( [ eq : ga - reaction ] ) estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite , including errors .",
    "all the measured ratios are below unity , @xmath70 for gallex  @xcite we used the values based on the pulse shape analysis obtained by kaether _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath71 for sage  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of these results in terms of oscillation of @xmath0 into sterile neutrinos was performed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have done an analysis similar to the one described in ref .",
    "@xcite . tab .",
    "[ tab : ga - sa ] shows the data needed to perform our calculation .",
    "we have computed the theoretical value of the ratio @xmath68 for led as    @xmath72    by monte carlo integration .",
    "in fact , there are four different @xmath0 lines emitted by the @xmath7cr source , two with energy around 750 kev and cross section @xmath73 @xmath74 ( 90% ) and two with energy around 430 kev and cross section @xmath75 @xmath74 ( 10% ) and two different @xmath0 lines emitted by the @xmath8ar source , both with energy around 810 kev .",
    "we have verified that taking into account these different contributions in the calculation of @xmath68 as in ref .",

    ".for the gallex and sage source experiments we give the @xmath0 energy ( e ) of the primary @xmath0 line emitted by the source , the radius ( r ) and height ( h ) of the cylindrical detector volumes and the position of the sources in terms of height from the base of the detectors .",
    "the sources were placed along the axes of the detectors . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we have performed a @xmath76 analysis of the data and found a region allowed for the led parameters @xmath38 and @xmath43 that fit well the for data points , @xmath77 . in the left panels of fig .",

    "we note that the 1 @xmath10 allowed region is basically excluded by other experiments but there are still large 2 and 3 @xmath10 regions which are not in conflict with them .",
    "in fact , from fig .  [",
    "fig : prob - ee ] one can expect that there could be some `` tension '' between the ga and reactor data as the former prefer somewhat stronger reduction than the latter .      using the new reactor antineutrino flux calculations  @xcite the ratio between the number of @xmath11 observed and theoretically predicted for all short baseline reactor experiments",

    "@xcite and the parameterization given in @xcite to calculate the expected reactor fluxes .",
    "we implemented all experiments using a modified version of globes @xcite .",
    "we have fitted the new rates in the led scenario and obtained the allowed regions for the led parameters @xmath38 and @xmath43 . in the middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : allowed - regions ] we show these regions for nh ( upper panel ) and ih ( lower panel ) .",
    "we observe that these regions are more compatible with the limits coming from other oscillation experiments  @xcite , indicated by the black solid curve , than the ones obtained by ga data shown in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : allowed - regions ] .",
    "finally we show the results of the combined led analysis for gallex and sage source experiments with the one for the 19 short baseline reactor experiments . in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : allowed - regions ] we show the allowed regions for nh ( upper panel ) and ih ( lower panel ) in the plane of @xmath38 and @xmath43 obtained by combining ga source experiment and short baseline reactor experiments .",
    "we found that the combined data favor the nonzero value of the large extra dimension , 2.9 @xmath10 away from @xmath85 .",
    "we have further combined results of these ga source and short baseline reactor data and the data coming from kamland , chooz and minos previously considered in ref .",
    "@xcite but we do not show the plot here as it is quite similar to what have been shown in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : allowed - regions ] .",
    "the reason is that the region favored by gallium and reactor antineutrino anomalies and the region excluded by kamland , chooz and minos overlap scarcely .",
    "current neutrino data exhibit three anomalies , one in the appearance mode , @xmath3 excess in lsnd  @xcite and miniboone  @xcite experiments , the other two are deficit of @xmath0 in the gallium solar neutrino calibration experiments  @xcite and of @xmath3 in the short baseline ( @xmath12 m ) reactor experiments  @xcite . possible solution to these problems involving oscillation into one or two species of sterile neutrinos whose mass squared differences are separated from the active ones by @xmath5 ev@xmath6 , have been proposed .    in this work",
    "we show that the two of these anomalies in the disappearance mode can be explained by an alternative solution , oscillation of @xmath0 and @xmath3 into sterile kaluza - klein neutrinos which are present in a model with large extra dimensions with a dimension size of @xmath86 m , and compatible with the limits coming from other oscillation experiments analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us make some comments on led limits coming from other sources / considerations besides kk bulk neutrinos .",
    "first , cosmological and astrophysical bounds on led ( or equivalently on the fundamental scale of gravity ) due to the over production and/or decays of kk gravitons into sm particles in various cosmological / astrophysical environments give , in general , much stronger bounds than the ones coming from laboratory experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , since these bounds are not completely model independent and not coming directly from the presence of the kk neutrinos , we do not try to make a direct comparison here .    instead",
    ", we prefer to quote some cosmological limits coming directly from the presence of the kk neutrinos obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case where the `` normalcy '' temperature of the universe ( considered as the temperature at which the universe should be free from the kk modes for graviton production , see the last reference in  @xcite ) was assumed to be @xmath87 1 gev , for @xmath88 ( @xmath89 being the number of large extra dimensions of equal size ) , by requiring that neutrinos should not contribute too much to the energy density of the universe , a size larger than @xmath90 m for @xmath21 larger than 0.01 ev is excluded ( for @xmath91 the bounds become stronger , see fig . 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "this may seem to exclude our solution , but we can not make a direct comparison since we assumed here that only one , the largest extra dimension ( the other dimensions having negligible size ) , can contribute to alter significantly the oscillation probability .    on the other hand , a complementary analysis to ref .",
    "@xcite was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite where a bound on the size of the largest extra dimension was derived such that the kk modes would not cause any conflict between the successful theoretical predictions of the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and its observations . since in this case it was assumed that only a single kk tower would contribute to modify bbn , we can make a direct comparison . from fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , we observe that the typical solution we found , @xmath92 a few @xmath93 m and @xmath94 ev is still allowed .",
    "we note that the @xmath3 excess observed in the lsnd and miniboone experiments can not be explained by the simple led scenario we consider in this work . in order to do that this scenario would have to be extended ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , however the lsnd / miniboone anomaly is becoming much weaker with new data .",
    "while the future minos and double chooz data can improve somewhat the limits in the small @xmath38 parameter region  @xcite , it seems not easy to exclude or confirm the led solution discussed in this work .",
    "this also seems to apply to the sterile neutrino explanations discussed in refs .",
    "in fact as far as the gallium and reactor antineutrino anomalies are concerned , behavior of these two solutions are similar ( as both of these solutions exhibit rapid oscillations ) so that it would not be so easy to distinguish them .",
    "possibly , a large liquid scintillator detector with very low background such as kamland  @xcite using a pbq scale radioactive source deployed in its center , capable of very good vertex reconstruction , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , could allow us to observe the rapid oscillation patterns which may help in identifying the solution to the gallium and reactor antineutrino anomalies .",

    "<S> we consider an alternative explanation for the deficit of @xmath0 in ga solar neutrino calibration experiments and of the @xmath1 in short baseline reactor experiments by a model where neutrinos can oscillate into sterile kaluza - klein modes that can propagate in compactified sub - micrometer flat extra dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed the results of the gallium radioactive source experiments and 19 reactor experiments with baseline shorter than 100 m , and showed that these data can be fitted into this scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the lightest neutrino mass and of the size of the largest extra dimension that are compatible with these experiments are mostly not excluded by other neutrino oscillation experiments .    </S>",
