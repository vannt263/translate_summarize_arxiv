    "in low - energy heavy - ion reactions , intermediate mass fragments ( imfs ) i.e. complex fragments with masses lighter than a@xmath720 , are emitted from both the light ( a@xmath860 ) and medium - mass ( a@xmath8110 ) compound systems , and may arise as multiple `` clusters '' , and are accompanied by multiple light particles ( z@xmath92 ) production .",
    "this light - particle emission , associated with evaporation residues production , is very satisfactorily understood as the fusion - evaporation process from an equiliberated compound nucleus in the statistical hauser - feshbach formalism @xcite , described in evaporation codes such as lilita and cascade or many other codes .",
    "the hauser - feshbach formalism has been extended to include the above noted observed complex imfs , for example in the busco code @xcite or in the extended hauser - feshbach method based on the scission - point picture @xcite .",
    "an alternative process for the imfs production is the binary decay of a compound nucleus in the statistical fission model of moretto @xcite or of vandenbosch and huizenga @xcite .",
    "the fission model of @xcite is used in the gemini code @xcite for the heavier compound systems ( a@xmath10100 ) , whereas the saddle - point transition - state model based on fission model of @xcite is used for the lighter systems ( a@xmath780 ) @xcite . the emission of light particles ( n , p , @xmath3 or @xmath11-ray ) in both of these fission models is still calculated within the hauser - feshbach formalism @xcite .    we know that the fission and cluster - decay are competing processes with the latter being more prevelent for lighter fragments @xcite",
    "in view of this result , in a very recent paper @xcite , we have proposed for the first time an alternative new `` cluster decay '' process for the imfs emitted from an excited @xmath12ba@xmath2 compound nucleus produced in the low - energy @xmath0ni+@xmath0ni reaction .",
    "the imfs are shown to arise as multiple `` clusters '' of masses a@xmath720 , and only at e@xmath13200 mev , in agreement with experimental results of beckerman et al .",
    "this result has its origin in the macroscopic liquid drop energy , since the shell effects are almost zero at the excitation energies involved .",
    "the multiple light particle ( z@xmath92 ) emission , other than via the statistical evaporation process ( not treated in this model ) , is also shown to become equally probable at higher energies where only the pure liquid drop energies enter the calculations .",
    "the macroscopic liquid drop energy was , however , taken to be temperature - independent @xcite and only the angular momentum @xmath14 case was considered .",
    "also , a generalized liquid - drop model has been proposed recently by royer and moustabchir @xcite to describe the light - nucleus emission .    in this paper",
    ", we extend our previous work @xcite by using the temperature - dependent liquid drop energy ( v@xmath15(t ) ) from davidson et al .",
    "@xcite , since the compound nucleus is hot enough at the excitation energies of interest .",
    "the other terms of the potential , that constitute the scattering potential v(r ) , are also taken temperature - dependent , based on refs .",
    "@xcite . in other words",
    ", we use a complete temperature - dependent potential and apply it to the medium - mass , hot compound system @xmath12ba@xmath2 formed in @xmath0ni+@xmath0ni reaction at various ( low ) incident energies @xcite .",
    "also , some of the specific data @xcite chosen here , and discussed in the following paragraph , was not analysed in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "this system has been of much interest from the point of view of the exotic @xmath4c ( or @xmath16sn ) cluster radioactivity @xcite , first expected as a ground - state decay @xcite , but now seems to have observable yields only for the decay of the corresponding excited compound system @xcite . another important point to note",
    "is that @xmath12ba is mainly a positive q - value ( q@xmath17 ) system ( negative q@xmath17 only for some light decay - fragments ) .",
    "our model is also applied to a negative q@xmath17 , light compound system @xmath18ni @xcite . also",
    ", the other , both lighter and heavier , isotopes of barium , @xmath19ba , have been of interest for both the ground - state and excited state decay studies @xcite .    the data chosen to test our model calculations in the following are the imfs production cross sections , measured in ( i ) the 630 mev @xmath0ni+@xmath0ni@xmath1ba@xmath2 reaction @xcite , whose kinematical analysis of fragments ( the similarity of gaussian shaped energy spectra of fragments in coincidence with @xmath11 rays , and the flat angular distribution of their ground and excited states ) revealed that the imfs with 4@xmath9z@xmath99 are consistent with the decay of a compound nucleus formed in a complete fusion reaction and that the effective temperature of the emitting system , estimated on the basis of a simple statistical approach for primary fragments , is on the average about 2.2 mev , which is about half of the compound nucleus temperature t ( = 4.42 mev , based on eq . ( [ eq:10 ] ) below ) ; and ( ii ) the 348 , 371 and 394 mev @xmath0ni+@xmath0ni reaction @xcite , where the pure hauser - feshbach busco predictions do not match the measured cross sections ( the same code is used with a reasonable success for the above mentioned data at 630 mev @xcite ) . in other words , so far only the pure hauser - feshbach analysis is made for both the experiments .",
    "also , like in @xcite , the total excitation energy ( txe ) in the exit channel is observed to be too small ( @xmath850 mev ) , compared to the available compound nucleus excitation energy e@xmath20 ( = 96.4 to 130.9 mev ) . as is already discussed in our earlier work @xcite , such data on txe ( or tke ) are best treated in a fission or a cluster decay model , and we use here the cluster decay model .    the dynamical cluster - decay model for hot compound systems , a reformulation of the preformed cluster model ( pcm ) of gupta and collaborators @xcite for ground - state decays , is presented in sec . 2 and its application to the hot @xmath12ba@xmath2 nucleus data is made in sec .",
    "the experimental data for imfs production cross sections are taken from fig .",
    "6 of @xcite , and from table 1 or fig . 2 of @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that any discussion of the emitted light particles in this paper is of those predicted here to occur at higher energies , and for the @xmath6=0 case only .",
    "the ( statistical ) evaporation of light particles , that may occur just before the beginning of the binary decay process of cluster emission studied here , is not included in this paper . finally , a summary and discussion of our results is added in sec .",
    "the dynamical cluster - decay model developed here for hot compound nucleus is an adaptation of the preformed cluster model ( pcm ) of gupta et al .",
    "@xcite for ground - state decays , which itself is based on the well - known quantum mechanical fragmentation theory , the qmft @xcite , given for fission and heavy - ion reactions and used later for the prediction of exotic cluster radioactivity @xcite . in the preformed cluster model , the decay half - life t@xmath21 , or the decay constant @xmath22 ,",
    "is defined as = ln 2=p_0_0 p , [ eq:1 ] where p@xmath23 , the preformation probability , refers to the motion in the mass asymmetry coordinate @xmath24=(a@xmath25-a@xmath26)/(a@xmath25+a@xmath26 ) and p , the penetrability , to the motion in the relative separation coordinate r. this means that , like in pcm , we treat the distribution of the imfs as a dynamical collective mass motion of preformed fragments or clusters through the barrier . in principle , the @xmath27 and r motions are coupled , but , in view of the defining eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and our earlier works @xcite , these are taken to be decoupled here .",
    "the @xmath28 is the assault frequency , defined below . in terms of the partial waves , the compound nucleus decay or the fragments production cross section = k^2_=0^_c(2 + 1)p_0p ; k= [ eq:2a ] with @xmath29m={1\\over 4}am(1-\\eta ^2)$ ] as the reduced mass and @xmath30 , the critical ( maximum ) angular momentum , defined later .",
    "m is the nucleon mass .",
    "this means that @xmath31 in ( [ eq:1 ] ) gives the cross section for @xmath14 case , with a normalization constant @xmath28 , instead of the @xmath32 in ( [ eq:2a ] ) .",

    "the c@xmath39 are the sssmann central radii c@xmath39=r@xmath39-(b / r@xmath39 ) , with the radii r@xmath39=1.28a@xmath40 - 0.76 + 0.8a@xmath41 fm and surface thickness parameter b=0.99 fm .",
    "thus , by raising the first turning point r@xmath36 from r@xmath36=r@xmath23 to r@xmath36=c@xmath37 or , in general , = c@xmath37+@xmath42 , the deformation effects of the two fragments ( and the neck formation between them ) are included here in the scattering potential v(r , t=0 ) , within the extended model of gupta and collaborators for both the light and heavy nuclear systems @xcite .",
    "the neck - length parameter @xmath42 , introduced at the scission configuration , simulates the two - centre nuclear shape parametrization and is equivalent to the lowering of the barrier for the case of deformed fragments @xcite .",
    "this method of inclusion of fragment deformations in the present calculations is quite similar to what has been achieved in both the saddle - point transition - state model of sanders @xcite and the scission - point extended hauser - feshbach method of matsuse and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the work of ref .",
    "@xcite also shows that the alternative of calculating the fragmentation potential @xmath43 and scattering potential v(r ) for actual deformations of the nuclei is not practical since the experimental deformation parameters for all the possible fragments ( a@xmath25,a@xmath26 ) , required for calculating v@xmath44 , are generally not available .",
    "note that the deformation effects of nuclei in the present calculations are also included via the sssmann central radii c@xmath39 and that c@xmath37 are different for different @xmath24-values and hence c@xmath37 is c@xmath45 .",
    "the temperature effects on radii r@xmath39 , and hence on c@xmath39 , the neck - length parameter @xmath46 and the surface width b are discussed in the following .    for the decay of a hot compound nucleus , we follow the prescription of our earlier work @xcite and define the first turning point r_a(t)=c_t(,t)+r(,t ) , [ eq:4 ] which means changing r@xmath36 to r@xmath47 for the hot compound nucleus .",
    "note that @xmath48 and @xmath49 are also taken temperature - dependent , as defined later .",
    "1 illustrates the scattering potential and other quantities of interest .",
    "apparently , @xmath49 depends on the total kinetic energy tke(t ) , and the corresponding potential v(r@xmath36 ) acts like an effective q - value , q@xmath50(t ) .",
    "since , r@xmath36=c@xmath45 for t=0 , the @xmath51 corresponds to the change in tke at t with respect to its value at t=0 and r@xmath36=c@xmath37 , and hence can be estimated exactly for the temperature effects included in the scattering potential v(r ) .",
    "we define q@xmath50(t ) in terms of the binding energies of the hot compound system and of the cold ( t=0 ) fragments , as q_eff(t)&=&b(t)-[b_1(t=0)+b_2(t=0 ) ] + & = & tke(t ) + & = & v(r_a ) , [ eq:5 ] meaning thereby that the decaying hot compound system , which is at temperature t at r = r@xmath36 , comes out of the barrier and gives in the exit channel two fragments that are cold ( t=0 ) .",
    "these two fragments in the exit channel go to ground state ( t=0 ) by emitting some light particle(s ) and/or @xmath11-ray(s ) of energy ( see fig .",

    "the remaining excitation energy of the decaying system is then , e_cn^*-e_x = q_out(t)+tke(t=0)+txe(t ) , [ eq:7a ] where , in the exit - channel the compound nucleus excitation energy e@xmath20 ( = @xmath53 , the sum of the entrance - channel centre - of - mass energy e@xmath54 and the corresponding q - value , q@xmath55=-67.59 mev for @xmath0ni+@xmath0ni@xmath1ba ) plus the ( positive ) q - value of exit - channel fragments at temperature t , q@xmath56 , is distributed into the total excitation energy ( txe ) and total kinetic energy ( tke ) of the two outgoing fragments , e_cn^*+q_out(t)=tke(t)+txe(t ) .",

    "the result of this calculation is presented in fig . 7 for all the strongly preformed and observed imfs ( z@xmath79 , a@xmath918 ) at the four experimental energies .",
    "some of the light particle emissions ( n and @xmath119h ) are not shown here since their q@xmath50 values are negative ( or nearly zero ) for all the t and r@xmath36 values considered here ( the dependence of the decay constant @xmath31 on r@xmath36 is already studied in our earlier work @xcite ; see also fig . 9 below ) . for @xmath118h , q@xmath50 is positive only for the two higher energies corresponding to t=3.20 and 4.42 mev .",
    "the role of the penetrability p is evident in fig .",
    "7 , since some of the strongly preformed fragments , like @xmath120he and @xmath121li , are now shown as less favoured decays ( smaller decay constants ) .",
    "@xmath122he , which has the largest preformation factor and decay constant for the ground - state decay ( see figs . 3 and 4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , lies here lowest for the hot @xmath12ba@xmath2 . on the other hand",
    ", the other two light particle ( @xmath118h and @xmath123he ) decays become the most probable ones at all t values here , and are kind of competing with the so - called statistically evaporated particles .",
    "also , the non-@xmath3 like decays , like @xmath124b and @xmath125n , with relatively low p@xmath23 s , are now the most predominant ones . in other words , with the t - dependence of v@xmath15 included , the exclusive preference for @xmath3-like imfs seems lost , the decay rates for non-@xmath3 like decays are higher , and the light particle production rates are the highest .",
    "however , the @xmath4c decay is still striking since it is the best @xmath3-nucleus decay even now , particularly at lower energies ( inspite of the lower preformation factor p@xmath23 at these energies ) . at higher energies , the lighter @xmath3-like fragment @xmath126be competes with it , though we know that @xmath127be is unbound in the ground state .",
    "note that the charge number z changes with t for some fragments ( here for the mass 17 fragment ) and hence at higher t s the measurements of charge distributions become equally important @xcite .",
    "the sudden increase in the production cross section ( @xmath31-value ) for @xmath128f at t@xmath1293.2 mev is due to its enhanced penetrability p , the q - value effect .",
    "( the same effect is observed later in fig .",
    "13 for t - dependence in all terms of the potential , but at higher temperature t=4.42 mev only ) .",
    "8 , upper panel , shows the imf production cross sections @xmath130 for z@xmath1319 , measured as compound nucleus decays at e@xmath54=315 mev @xcite , compared with our calculated s - wave production cross sections i.e. @xmath31-values for @xmath57=0.466 _ normalized _ to the experimental data for z@xmath26=6 fragment decay .",
    "the calculated yields are for the energetically favoured , most probable fragments in both the mass and charge numbers ( see figs . 4 and 6 ) and hence the yields for the same z@xmath26 but different masses are summed up .",
    "for example , the fragments contributing to the z@xmath26=6 fragment yield are the @xmath132c , @xmath4c , and @xmath133c fragments , and the same to the z@xmath26=7 fragment yield are the @xmath125n and @xmath134n fragments , etc . for z@xmath26=4",
    ", however , we should be cautious in making this comparison between the experiment and calculation since @xmath127be , being unbound as a ground state , may not be measured , but we have included it in our summed yields for z@xmath26=4 ( the other component is @xmath135be , with a rather small yield @xmath136 ) .",
    "the lower panel shows the same for another normalization of our calculations to the z@xmath26=7 fragment data .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "9 presents the same comparison ( only for normalization to the z@xmath26=6 fragment data ) for another two @xmath57 values .",
    "apparently , the calculations compare reasonably well with experiment and are almost independent of the ( empirical ) normalization constant as well as the exact choice of @xmath57 value . for the heavier fragments ( z@xmath1378 ) ,",
    "the calculated cross sections are rather small firstly because we are considering here the contribution of only @xmath14 term and secondly because the temperature effects are included only in v@xmath15 and @xmath138u .",
    "also , in experiments @xcite the contributions from other sources such as the peripheral collisions like projectile splitting or deep - inelastic - like mechanism are difficult to be separated out for the heavy fragments .",
    "thus , in view of the fact that we are dealing here with only the @xmath14 case and that the temperature effects are not fully included in the potential , the comparisons between the theory and experiments in figs . 8 and 9",
    "could be considered rather satisfactory .",
    "a comparison of our calculations with the experimental data at the other three lower energies @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "10 for only the four heavy residues @xmath139cd , @xmath16 in , @xmath140sn and @xmath141 in that have been actually measured at each of these three energies , as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig . 2 and table 1 of @xcite ) . in this case , the calculations have been normalized arbitrarily to the a@xmath25=102 fragment .",
    "some calculated fragments show a change of fragment charge number since we have considered here only the energetically favoured , most probable fragment in both mass and charge numbers which could be different from the one actually measured .",
    "the comparison shows that the predicted yields are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data .",
    "figure 11 gives the calculated fragmentation potentials v@xmath142 for t - dependence added in all the terms of the potential ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) , for @xmath14 ) .",
    "the t and @xmath57 values are the same as in fig . 4 for no t - effects in e@xmath111 and v@xmath90 .",
    "( the graph for t=0 is again shown here for comparisons ) .",
    "we notice that there is hardly any sizeable effect due to the additional t - dependences in e@xmath111 and v@xmath90 , when fig .",
    "11 is compared with fig .",
    "4 , at least for the structure and positions of minima , especially at lower t - values . at higher t - values , there are some very small changes , particularly for very light fragments ( a@xmath1312 ) .",
    "it is known @xcite that v@xmath90 does not contribute towards the structure and positions of minima in the fragmentation potential v@xmath112 and that e@xmath111 is a smoothly increasing function of a@xmath26 . however , the mass parameters b@xmath143 , though smooth , are now t - dependent , and this behaviour seems to enhance the formation probability p@xmath23 , presented in fig . 12 .",
    "the enhancement is by about one order of magnitude ( compare fig .",
    "12 with fig . 6 without t - dependence in e@xmath111 , v@xmath90 , and b@xmath143 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "we note that in the formation yield of @xmath4c , relative to its neighbouring fragments , the small peaked structure present in fig .",
    "6 is now absent in fig .",
    "figure 13 presents the result of our calculation for the decay constant @xmath31 ( equivalently , the s - wave production cross section ) as a function of compound nucleus temperature corresponding to four energies ( 174 , 185.5 , 197 , and 315 mev ) of the two selected experimental data sets of refs .",
    "we notice important differences with respect to the case of no temperature in e@xmath111 and v@xmath90 ( compare fig . 13 with fig .",
    "7 ) . here , for light particles , instead of only @xmath118h and @xmath122he at higher temperatures ,",
    "we get @xmath119h , @xmath123h and @xmath122he at all the temperatures which is favoured by the experimental data ( for the neutron , the q@xmath50 is still negative ) .",
    "note that here these light fragments are not the statistically treated prompt particles , though the calculated yields are shown to be large ( calculations made so far are only for the @xmath14 case ) .",
    "interesting enough , @xmath4c decay is still the most favoured @xmath3-nucleus decay , though other non-@xmath3 fragments are shown to compete .",
    "also , some fragments having smaller cross sections at lower energies are shown to have enhanced cross sections at the higher energy .",
    "finally , a comparison of our calculated s - wave cross sections with the measured cross sections is made in figs .",
    "14 and 15 .",
    "14 shows this comparison for the e@xmath54=315 mev data @xcite with our calculated decay constants ( s - wave cross sections ) normalized to z@xmath26=6 fragment data .",

    "@xcite . here",
    "the data are obtained for only the heavy fragments and we have normalized our calculations to the mass 102 fragment .",
    "the comparisons between the calculations and data are rather good at all energies , and better than for the earlier case displayed in figs .",
    "8 , 9 and 10 .",
    "the improvement demonstrates the need of including temperature dependence in all the terms of the potential .",
    "summarizing , first the use of t - dependent v@xmath15 is studied for the cluster decay process proposed for the imfs emission @xcite induced in heavy - ion collisions at low bombarding energies ( e@xmath14415 mev / a ) .",
    "the model is extended and applied to @xmath0ni+@xmath0ni@xmath1ba@xmath2 at various centre - of - mass energies from 174 to 315 mev .",
    "interesting and important enough , with the use of a t - dependent v@xmath15 ( for @xmath6=0 case only ) , the explicit preference for @xmath3-like imfs ( or clusters ) is lost , though the @xmath4c ( or @xmath5sn ) decay ( first expected from the ground state decay of @xmath12ba @xcite ) is still found to be the most preferred @xmath3-like fragment .",
    "also , the non-@xmath3 imfs and some light particles with z@xmath72 are shown to be produced with larger yields , without the inclusion of any statistical evaporation process . with t - dependence included in all the terms of the potential ,",
    "the production yields are enhanced and comparisons with data are improved .",
    "further improvements are expected with the inclusion of contributions from all @xmath6-waves , which is being worked out .    also , the tkes are measurable quantities , but the same are available for the @xmath0ni+@xmath0ni reaction only for e@xmath54=315 mev @xcite and at only one angle and four charges ( without the mass identification of imfs ) . in our model , as already defined above and in fig .",
    "1 , the angle - integrated total kinetic energies are given by tke = v(r@xmath36)=v(c@xmath145r)=q@xmath50 .",
    "since the calculated production yields are almost independent of the ( arbitrarily ) chosen average @xmath57 values , only the relative variation and not the absolute magnitude of tkes could be obtained at present in this model .",
    "furthermore , the angular momentum contribution ( not included as yet ) is a must for tkes calculations .",
    "such type of calculations have already been performed @xcite for the lighter system @xmath146s+@xmath147mg@xmath148ni where the angle integrated tkes data were available @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to apply similar considerations to @xmath12ba@xmath2 when similar data on tkes become available .",
    "also , it would be of interest if the statistical fission model , as introduced in the gemini code @xcite could also be applied to the @xmath0ni+@xmath0ni reaction and its predictions compared with the present cluster decay model results as well as to the pure hauser - feshbach busco results .",
    "furthermore , a similar comparison using the alternate picture as generalized liquid - drop model @xcite or the so - called unified fission models for cluster decay studies @xcite is called for since these models do not introduce any preformation factor . +",
