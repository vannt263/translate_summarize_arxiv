    "pollen allergy is a common disease causing hay fever in 5 - 10% of the population . although not a life threatening disease , the symptoms can be very troublesome , furthemore , the costs to the social sector due to pollen related diseases are high .",
    "self protection of hay fever patients is possible through the information of future pollen contents in the air @xcite .",
    "models to forecast pollen concentration in the air are principally based on pollen and atmospheric weather interactions .",
    "several statistical techniques @xcite , have been used to predict future atmospheric pollen concentrations from weather conditions of the day and of recent previous days . in spite of these attempts ,",
    "it has not been possible to predict the pollen concentrations with great accuracy , and about 25% of the daily pollen forecasts have resulted in failures @xcite .",
    "+ a reason of these failures could be that the methods used in airborne pollen forecasting are based in standard linear statistical techniques which do nt suit when the phenomenon to forecast is esentially non - linear .",
    "a previous analysis of the dynamic characteristics of time series of atmospheric pollen was developed by bianchi et al .",
    "@xcite , through the study of the correlation dimension @xcite .",
    "the dimension found was a low and non integer value @xcite , which indicates that the system may be described by a nonlinear function of just a few variables relating nearest pollen concentrations of the time series .",
    "the fact that the correlation dimension found was fractal predicts that this function , also called map in nonlinear dynamics can display chaotic behavior under certain circumstances .",
    "the existence of a low dimensional map suggests possibilities for short - term prediction @xcite through the use of some nonlinear model .",
    "artificial neural networks have been widely used to predict future values of chaotic time series identifying the nonlinear model by extracting knowledge from the past @xcite .",
    "very good pollen concentrations forecasts were obtained using neural nets @xcite and , in a previous work , the hypothesis that random fluctuations appearing in the pollen time series are produced by gaussian noise was rejected @xcite .    to continue with the characterization of airborne pollen concentrations the next step would be to study",
    "what kind of correlation is associated with its fluctuations .",
    "the hurst exponent @xmath0 is broadly used as a measure of the persistence of a statistical phenomenon .",
    "@xmath1 points an antipersistent time series , commonly driven by a phenomenon called  noah effect \" ( if you see the bible , the storm changed everything in a moment ) .",
    "it characterizes a system that reverses itself more frequently and covers less distance than a random walk .",
    "@xmath2 implies that we are analyzing a persistent time series which obeys to the ",
    "joseph effect \" ( in the bible refers to 7 years of loom , happiness and health and 7 years of hungry and illness ) .",
    "this system has long memory effects : what happens now will influence the future , so there is a very deep dependence with the initial conditions .",
    "persistent processes are common in nature @xcite .",
    "if the distribution is homogeneous there is an unique @xmath3 , but if it is not there are several exponents @xmath4",
    ". the most frequent @xmath4 will characterize the series and will play as hurst exponent @xmath0 . a very efficient new method to obtain",
    "the @xmath5 singularity spectrum of a pollen time series relies on the use of a mathematical tool introduced in signal analysis in the early eighties : the _ wavelet transform_. the wavelet transform has been proved very efficient to detect singularities and fractals are singular functions indeed .",
    "et al_@xcite developed the _ wavelet transform modulus maxima _",
    "( wtmm ) method as a technique to study fractal objects . in this method",
    "the wavelet is used as an oscillating variant of the @xmath6square  function of a box .",
    "wtmm was succesfully applied to study fractal properties of diverse systems such as dna nucleotide sequences @xcite , modane turbulent velocity signal @xcite and a cool flame experiment @xcite .",
    "we apply wtmm to obtain the hurst exponents @xmath0 associated with the pollen time series as a whole as well as the persistence of the important rare peaks of highest concentrations .",
    "another important tool in describing multifractals that are obtained through wtmm are the generalized fractal dimensions @xmath7 .",
    "the material used in this work was from our chaos study of pollen series @xcite .",
    "data of airborne pollen concentration were obtained with an automatic and volumetric burkard pollen and spore trap , situated at the roof of the facultad de ciencias exactas y naturales of our university , 12 meters above ground level .",
    "the area surrounding the sample is typical of mar del plata .",
    "the great distance from the sampling site to the emission sources makes the particular emission spectra not important .",
    "ten liters of air per minute were sucked through a 14 x 2 @xmath8 orifice , always orientated against the wind flow .",
    "the sucking rate is checked weekly . behind the slit",
    ", a drum rotates at a speed of 2 @xmath9 per hour .",
    "the particles are collected on a cellophane tape ( melinex ) , 19 @xmath10 wide , just below the orifice .",
    "the sticky collecting surface comprises nine parts vaseline : one part paraffin in toluene .",
    "the exposed tape is removed from the drum , cut into pieces of 48 mm , corresponding to 24-h intervals , then embedded into a solution of polivinylalcohol ( gelvatol ) , water and glycerol and covered with a cover glass .",
    "slides were studied as 12 transects per day .",
    "the pollen was counted at a magnification of x400 for the first year cycle ( august 1987 - 8 ) and at x200 for the second ( august 1988 - 9 ) , and corresponding to 13.5 and 27 min of sampling every 2 h respectively .",
    "the method of counting pollen follows that of kapyla and penttinen @xcite .",
    "hourly counts were stored in a database file for further analysis .",
    "statistics of hourly counts may be seen in table 1 and 2 of @xcite .",
    "the concentration values correspond to total pollen grains .",
    "the main species found were : cupressus , gramineae , eucalyptus , pinace , chenopodiineae , plantago , cyperaceae , betula , cruciferae , compositae tueulflorae , ambrosia , ulmus , umbelliferae , platanus and fraxinus .",
    "the aim of this formalism is to determinate the f(@xmath4 ) singularity spectrum of a measure @xmath11 .",
    "it associates the haussdorff dimension of each point with the singularity exponent @xmath4 , which gives us an idea of the strength of the singularity .    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the number of boxes needed to cover the measure and @xmath14 is the size of each box @xcite .",
    "a partition function @xmath15 can be defined from this spectrum ( it is the same model as the thermodinamic one ) .    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a spectrum which arouses by legendre transforming the @xmath5 singularity spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath18 is obtained from the spectrum @xmath17",
    "@xmath19    the capacity or box dimension of the support of the distribution is given by @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 corresponds to the scaling behavior of the information and is called @xmath22 . for @xmath23 , @xmath7 and",
    "the @xmath24 are related .    as we will show in the following section the wavelet transform",
    "is specially suited to analyze a time series as a multifractal .",
    "the wavelet transform ( wt ) @xcite of a signal @xmath25 consists in decomposing it into frequency and time coefficients , asociated to the wavelets .",
    "the analyzing wavelet @xmath26 , by means of translations and dilations , generates the so called family of wavelets .",
    "the wavelet transform turns the signal @xmath25 into a function @xmath27(a , b)$ ] :    @xmath28(a , b)= \\frac{1}{a}\\int { \\psi}^{*}[\\frac{t - b}{a}]s(t)dt,\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the complex conjugate of @xmath26 , @xmath30 is the frequency dilation factor and @xmath31 , the time translation parameter .",
    "the wavelet to apply must be chosen with the condition : @xmath32    and to be orthogonal to lower order polynoms @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the order of the polynom .",
    "in other words , lower order polinomial behavior is eliminated and we can detect and characterize singularities even if they are masked by a smooth behavior .    the wt provides a useful tool to the detection of self - similarity or self - affinity in temporal series . for a value @xmath31 in the domain of the signal ,",
    "the modulus of the transform is maximized when the frequency @xmath30 is of the same order of the characteristic frequency of the signal @xmath25 in the neighborhood of @xmath31 , this last one will have a local singularity exponent @xmath35n , n+1[$ ] .",
    "this means that around @xmath31    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is an @xmath38 order polynomial , and    @xmath39    provided the first @xmath40 moments are zero .    if we have @xmath41 , the first @xmath42 moments are vanishing .",
    "the wavelet modulus function @xmath43(a , t)|$ ] will have a local maximum around the points where the signal is singular .",
    "these local maxima points make a geometric place called modulus maxima line @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45(a , b_l(a))| \\sim",
    "a^\\alpha(b_l(a))\\:\\:\\:\\:\\ : for \\:\\ : a \\to 0,\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 is the position at the scale @xmath30 of the maximum belonging to the the line @xmath44 .    the wavelet transform modulus maxima method ( wtmm ) consists in the analysis of the scaling behavior of some partition functions @xmath47 that can be defined as :    @xmath48(a , b_l(a))|^q,\\ ] ]    and will scale like @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "this partition function works like the previously defined partition function for singular measures . for @xmath50 will prevail the most pronounced modulus maxima and , on the other hand , for @xmath51 will survive the lower ones .",
    "the most pronounced modulus take place when very deep singularities are detected , while the others correspond to smoother singularities .",
    "we can get @xmath17 ( eq .",
    "2 ) and obtain @xmath5 and @xmath7 spectra , as explained previously .",
    "the shape of @xmath5 is a hump that has a maximum value , @xmath4 corresponding to this maximum may be associated with the general behavior of the series .",
    "so , this particular singularity exponent can be thought like the hurst exponent @xmath0 for the series as a whole .",
    "the airborne pollen concentration time series may be seen in fig .",
    "the third derivative of gaussian function was chosen as analyzing wavelet :    @xmath52    twelve wavelet transform data files were obtained applying the wavelet transform with @xmath53 , ranging the scaling factor @xmath30 from @xmath54 to @xmath55 in steps of @xmath56 . to give an idea of the effect of the change of scale on wavelet transform of the pollen time series , three of them are shown in fig .",
    "2 .    then we computed the partition function @xmath47 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , getting @xmath17 , as shown in fig .",
    "3 .    @xmath17 is a nonlinear convex increasing function with @xmath59 and two asymptotic slopes which are @xmath60 for @xmath50 and @xmath61 for @xmath51 .",
    "this lays the corresponding @xmath5 singularity spectrum obtained by legendre transforming @xmath17 that is displayed in fig .",
    "4 . the single humped shape with a nonunique hlder exponent obtained characterizes a multifractal .",
    "as expected from @xmath17 , the support of @xmath5 extends over a finite interval which bounds are @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the minimum value , @xmath62 , corresponds to the strongest singularity which characterizes the most rarified zone , whereas higher values exhibit weaker singularities until @xmath63 or weakest singularity which corresponds to the densiest zone .",
    "@xmath64 corresponds to an antipersistent process and @xmath65 , to a regular process .",
    "the @xmath7 spectrum obtained from @xmath17 can be seen in fig .",
    "5 . the support dimension @xmath66 ; which implies that the capacity of the support is approximately 1",
    "; i.e. the support is not a fractal .",
    "@xmath7 converges asymptotically to @xmath60 for @xmath67 and to @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "the hlder exponent for the dimension support , @xmath70 , is 0.90 .",
    "this particular @xmath4 corresponds to @xmath71 or @xmath72 which implies that the sucesses with @xmath73 are the most frequent ones .",
    "@xmath74 implies we are analyzing a persistent time series which obeys to the `` joseph effect '' ( in the bible refers to 7 years of loom , happiness and health and 7 years of hungry and illness ) @xcite .",
    "this system has long memory effects : what happens now will influence the future , so there is a very deep dependence with the initial conditions .",
    "it may be thought like a fractional brownian motion of @xmath75 .",
    "a hurst exponent of 0.90 describes a very persistent time series , what is expected in a natural process involved in an inertial system .",
    "@xmath4 can be known as hlder exponent or singularity exponent , too .",
    "if the distribution is homogeneous there is an unique @xmath3 ( for example fractional brownian motion ) , but if it is not there are several exponents @xmath4",
    ". the most frequent @xmath4 will characterize the series and will play as hurst exponent .",
    "this means that the curve is equally humped in both sides with the consequence of having the same inhomogeneity in the less frequent events associated with the @xmath51 branch and in the more frequent ones associated with the @xmath77 branch .",
    "the information dimension is @xmath78 which features the scaling behavior of the information .",
    "it plays an important role in the analysis of nonlinear dynamic systems , specially in describing the loss of information as chaotic system evolves in time @xcite .",
    "@xmath79 implies that we are in the presence of a chaotic system .",
    "the correlation dimension is @xmath80 which characterizes a chaotic attractor and is very close to the value previously obtained with the grassberger - procaccia method @xcite .",
    "the wavelet transform modulus maxima method was applied to study the multifractal characteristics of an airborne pollen time series .",
    "we have found that pollen time series behave as a whole like long term memory persistent phenomena , as most ones in nature .",
    "the most common events associated with @xmath63 which correspond to low pollen concentration values behave in a persistent way as the whole series . on the other hand ,",
    "the most rare events associated in the multifractal formalism to @xmath62 which correspond to highest pollen concentration values behave in an antipersistent way characterized by the `` noah effect '' , changing suddenly and catastrophically the air conditions .",
    "both the information and the correlation dimensions correspond to a chaotic system showing loss of information with time evolution .",
