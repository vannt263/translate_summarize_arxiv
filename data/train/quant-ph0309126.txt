    "state selective manipulation of the discrete - level quantum systems such as atoms , molecules or quantum dots is the ultimate tool for many diverse fields such as laser control of chemical reactions , atom optics , high - precision metrology and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "the elementary process on which many schemes of such manipulation rely are rabi population oscillations between the two selected levels of the system . in the lowest approximation ,",
    "these oscillations are induced by perturbing the system using coherent monochromatic external drive tuned into resonance with the desired transition .",
    "the name of this phenomenon stems from the name of the author of the first approximate analytic assessment of this process @xcite .",
    "the original rabi theory is simple to present and comprehend , but has two drawbacks .",
    "the first is that due to the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , under which it is obtained , its validity is limited even in pure two - level systems .",
    "a number of papers has been published concerning the solution of population dynamics without the rwa @xcite which are all based on fairly involved mathematical apparatus and hence quite un - intuitive . also , as these methods are founded on perturbative approaches , the solution in the case of the extreme breakdown of rwa - which is extremely simple ( although maybe not very useful ) - is seldom mentioned .",
    "secondly , the analytical approach to single - laser rabi oscillations is generally constrained to simple two level system , and hence its validity is necessarily limited when it is applied to more complex many - level systems . since many ( or , indeed , most ... ) interesting real systems actually are many - level systems , at least a rough assessment of influence of their structural complexity on the rabi oscillations between the selected two levels should be done before applying them to complex systems .",
    "finally , looking through the literature i have not managed to find a thorough discussion of the validity of rwa solution for the dynamics of a two level system driven by the perturbation whose frequency is far off resonance .    in this paper",
    "all of these questions are addressed . in the first section ,",
    "mathematically simple yet thorough analysis of the rwa limitations in the two - level systems is presented . in the second , a simple criterium ( based on _ rabi profiles _ ) for the analysis of the validity of rwa - based solutions is established .",
    "this enables a quick estimation of the validity of the rabi solution for certain system parameters just by visually inspecting the shape of a simple lorenzian curve .",
    "finally , the third section is devoted to discussion of how the concept of rabi spectrum may be used to estimate the validity of the two - level rabi solution in a general many - level system .    in all the calculations value of the planck constant",
    "is taken to be @xmath0 .",
    "in this section a simple , yet thorough analysis of validity of the rabi rwa solution in the two level system is presented .",
    "the results obtained - majority of which are quite well known - will serve as strict mathematical basis for consequent discussions .",
    "consider a two - level quantum system .",
    "its dynamics is described by the time dependent schrdinger equation : @xmath1 @xmath2 denotes the set of all spatial coordinates of the system .",
    "@xmath3 is unperturbed time - independent hamiltonian of the system , satisfying the eigenequation : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are eigenfunctions and respective total energies of the unperturbed system .",
    "@xmath7 is the homogeneous monochromatic perturbation : @xmath8 @xmath9 is spatial operator odd with respect to central inversion ( e.g. dipole , quadrupole , ... ) through which the perturbation establishes coupling between the two levels of the system .",
    "@xmath10 is the parameter determining perturbation intensity ( which shall be referred to as the _ perturbation intensity _ for short ) .",
    "@xmath11 is constant but tunable frequency of the external perturbation . expressing the solution @xmath12 as an expansion over eigenstates @xmath5 , @xmath13 eq .",
    "( [ schequ ] ) transforms into a system of two coupled differential equations for the time dependent expansion coefficients @xmath14 : @xmath15 here @xmath16 , @xmath17  and @xmath18 . from the definition it is evident that @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "combining the two expansion coefficients into a two - component vector @xmath21 , expanding a cosine term as @xmath22 and re - scaling the time variable to @xmath23 casts eq .",
    "( [ couequ ] ) into convenient matrix form : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "evolution of the population of a particular level is given by @xmath27 .",
    "the rotating wave approximation hinges on the assumption that the complex exponential terms containing @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ matfor ] ) have only minor ( or even negligible ) impact on the system dynamics and may hence be dropped in all further calculations . however , in order to fully explore their influence , they shall be keep throughout this calculation .",
    "now the following procedure is administered : first eq .",
    "( [ matfor ] ) is differentiated with respect to @xmath29 ; then the same equation is used to eliminate @xmath30 that appears during the differentiation on the right - hand side ; finally , the matrix equation is split into two ordinary coupled differential equations for the coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the following expression is hence obtained : @xmath33 where the first index corresponds to the upper sign and the second to the lower .",
    "as no approximations have yet been introduced , this is still the full dynamical equation equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ matfor ] ) .",
    "initial conditions comprise the whole population of the system located in one of the two levels , with the other level being completely empty .    keeping only the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ fulleq ] ) leads straight to the on - resonance rabi rwa solution , sinusoidal population oscillations with period @xmath34 and amplitude @xmath35 ( for details see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "whether or not the remaining terms on the right - hand side may be considered dynamically insignificant depends on the relation between the period @xmath36 and periods of oscillating and complexly rotating parts of these remaining terms .",
    "if any of those is much smaller than @xmath36 then the value of the elements on the right - hand side in which they are contained averages up to zero during any time interval small compared to the one in which @xmath31 and @xmath32 significantly change , and hence they play no dynamical role .",
    "otherwise they have to be taken into consideration .    shifting the perturbation frequency just slightly away from the resonance , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ fulleq ] ) enters the arena .",
    "taken together , the first two terms lead to the generalized rabi oscillations with period @xmath37 and amplitude @xmath38 ( for details see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "so , a shift from the resonance increases the frequency of population oscillations but at the same time reduces their amplitude .    to proceed , note that @xmath28 by its definition is always larger than @xmath39 . indeed , when perturbation is relatively close to the resonance - and if anywhere , the rwa solution should be valid in this spectral region - @xmath40 . the interplay of the relative dynamical significance of the remaining two terms on the right - hand side in eq .",
    "( [ fulleq ] ) depends only on exact magnitude of @xmath28 : if @xmath41 , both of them rotate roughly at the same rate but as the ratio of their amplitudes is @xmath42 , the contribution of the first one overshadows the contribution of the second one ; if however , the case is opposite , i.e. @xmath43 , then the amplitude of the former is so much inferior to that of the later that the contribution of the third term can be neglected when compared to that of the fourth .",
    "now consider the former case , that is @xmath41 so that additional dynamical features that generalized rwa solution fails to encompass are basically provided through the third term in eq .",
    "( [ fulleq ] ) . in full numerical solution for this case ,",
    "these additional features are observed as the additional bloch - siegert oscillations superimposed on the pure sinusoidal population transfer curve .",
    "also , an additional property of the full solution for this case which rwa rabi solution can not capture is the shift in the resonant frequency @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "one way to quantify the limitations of the rwa rabi solution for this case is to try to estimate what the amplitude of these superimposed population oscillations is - as long as they are small enough , rwa solution can be considered as a decent approximation to the full solution .",
    "this can be done as follows .",
    "the approximate non - rwa solution is sought as a sum @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the generalized rabi rwa solution ( taking care of the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ fulleq ] ) ) and @xmath47 the correction due to the additional third term - remember that the fourth term is neglected because of the assumption that @xmath41 . inserting this sum into eq .",
    "( [ matfor ] ) and assuming that @xmath48 componentwise , the formal perturbative solution for the correction is obtained : @xmath49    as @xmath41 holds , the frequency @xmath50 of @xmath51 will certainly be much smaller than the frequency of complex exponentials inside the matrix .",
    "hence , the obtained integral can be evaluated between some @xmath52 and @xmath29 such that @xmath53 by taking almost constant @xmath54 outside the integral .",
    "the remaining integration is simple and finally yields : @xmath55    the frequency of the components of @xmath56 is evidently much higher than that of the corresponding components of @xmath46 . as the amplitude of both matrix elements is @xmath57 , the ratio of amplitudes of the correction components and the generalized rabi rwa solution components @xmath58 amounts @xmath59 .",
    "thus , while @xmath41 , @xmath60 the rwa generalized rabi solution is a good approximation to the full solution and the dynamical significance of the third term in eq . ( [ fulleq ] ) may be neglected .    the last remaining term in eq .",
    "( [ fulleq ] ) has a fixed amplitude equal to @xmath61 .",
    "it can be neglected if @xmath62 , due to the zero - averaging effect of its rapid rotation , and since @xmath39 can be reduced to zero , in the worst case this reduces to @xmath41 - which is the same as for the third component .",
    "however , this term has a prominent role in the extreme situation , when @xmath43 .",
    "in such a case , the third term may be neglected due to its vanishing amplitude , and since @xmath63 even more so may the second term .",
    "( [ fulleq ] ) then reduces to : @xmath64 which leads to the population oscillations with amplitude @xmath57 , but with temporally modulated period @xmath65 . as with the third term , this one is also inherently related to the inclusion of the non - rwa contributions in matrix in eq .",
    "( [ matfor ] ) .",
    "it should be kept in mind that in this case the perturbation is extremely strong . under such circumstances",
    "the corresponding potential @xmath66 in dynamical equation ( eq . ( [ drirad ] ) ) might need to be corrected with higher order interaction terms ( quadrupole , octupole , ... ) .",
    "indeed , it may also happen that the structure of the original two - level system becomes significantly distorted or even that the system breaks up completely .",
    "hence this result might not be very useful from the point of controlled system manipulation .",
    "all in all , it may be concluded that the rabi rwa solution is an excellent approximation to the exact solution of eq.([matfor ] ) in complete spectral range @xmath67 of perturbation frequencies - and not just close to resonance @xmath44 - as long as : @xmath68",
    "in this section the notion of _ rabi profile _ is introduced and it is demonstrated how the obtained condition for the validity of the rabi rwa solution , @xmath41 , can conveniently be visualized in terms of it .      _",

    "is obtained : @xmath73 . in the worst case",
    "this reduces to : @xmath74 or , put in words , distance of the profile s center from the origin of the spectrum ( @xmath75 ) must be much greater than the profile s half - width .",
    "we may also rephrase it as : at the origin of the spectrum the height of the profile must be negligible. if this condition is fulfilled , population of a two - level system driven with any desired frequency @xmath11 will exhibit pure sinusoidal oscillations with amplitude equal to the height @xmath76 of the rabi profile at the selected frequency and period equal to : @xmath77    fig . 2 exhibits four cases of the population dynamics in a resonantly driven two - level system .",

    "so in the three level system we expect the population dynamics would change from that in the previous case as now both transitions react significantly to the applied drive . based on the discussion in the previous section , it can be suggested that it would roughly comprise of most population being exchanged along transition @xmath111 with the remaining fraction being now also exchanged among levels 2 and 3 .",

    "s rabi spectrum has significant height at the resonant frequency of that transition - except , of course , the rabi profile of that selected transition ( which is 1 at its own resonant frequency ) .",

    "5 in that paper is actually the rabi spectrum plot .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "6b in the same paper , minor oscillations can be noticed superimposed on top of almost pure rabi oscillations of one of the populations .",
    "these minor oscillations gave me the idea that rabi profile plots might be used as an indicator as to when the pure rabi oscillations , which are a straightforward two - level rwa solution , fail to provide the satisfactory solution to the complete dynamics of a more complex many - level system .",
    "although the presented analysis is mathematically quite simple , it nevertheless enables a very good order - of - magnitude estimates for maximum driving field intensities that can be used to efficiently drive the selected transition .",
    "rabi spectra method hence hints on one interesting application .",
    "namely , knowing the details of the internal structure of a particular quantum system , the rabi spectrum for each transition in that system can be calculated .",
    "this data can then be used to quickly quantitatively estimate the lower limit for clean population transfer time that can be achieved on any particular transition .",
    "finally , a numerical scheme can be build to search for the quickest pathway through the system along which population can be transferred between any two selected levels , and lower limit of the time needed can be estimated .",
    "most of all , rabi spectra method offers conceptual simplicity and intuitiveness which are both of utmost importance when whole subject is presented either to interested non - experts or to newcomers in the field .",
    "hence it can be considered very suitable both as a quick lab - reference tool as well as a simple didactic introduction into much more involved strict quantitative theory .",
    "the full analytical treatment of the selective population transfer mechanism provides many additional interesting results .",
    "it can thus be shown @xcite that by using analytically determined chirp ( i.e. time dependent variation of the perturbation frequency ) instead of resonant frequency to drive any particular transition , more efficient population transfer can be achieved .",
