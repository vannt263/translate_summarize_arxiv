    "one of the main motivations to study quantum cosmology is to investigate if quantum gravitational effects can avoid the singularities which are present in classical cosmological models @xcite .",
    "if this is indeed the case for the initial singularity , the next step should be to find in what conditions the universe recovers its classical behaviour , yielding the large classical expanding universe we live in . in this paper",
    "we investigate these problems in the framework of minisuperspace models with scalar fields as sources of the gravitational field .    as a first example",
    ", we took a non - massive , minimally coupled scalar field , in a friedman - robertson - walker universe with spacelike sections with positive constant curvature .",
    "this model can be viewed as an effective multidimensional theory where the scalar field is understood as the scale factor of internal dimensions @xcite , or as a brans - dicke model redefined by a conformal transformation @xcite .",
    "we were able to find the general classical solutions .",
    "all of them present initial and final singularities .",
    "the model is quantized in the dirac way , with arbitrary factor ordering , and the general solution of the corresponding wheeler - dewitt equation is found . to interpret the solutions , we first adopted the ` peak interpretation ' , where a prediction is made when the wave function is sharply peaked in a region and almost zero outside this region @xcite .",
    "a gaussian superposition of wkb solutions was constructed . by employing the stationary phase condition",
    ", we were able to show that this superposition is sharply peaked around the classical trajectory only for small values of the scale factor .",
    "hence , contrarily to what is usually expected , the classical limit is recovered for small values of the scale factor , not for large ones .",
    "a consequence of this fact is that the initial classical singularities continue to be present at the quantum level . in order to confirm this strange behaviour",
    ", we also adopted an alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics which was not constructed for cosmology but which can be easily applied to a single system : it is the causal or the bohm - de broglie interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "it is completely different from the others because it is an ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics . in the case of non - relativistic particles ,",
    "the quantum particles follows a real trajectory , independently of any observations , and it is accompanied by a wave function .",
    "the quantum effects are brought about by a quantum potential , which can be derived from the schrdinger equation .",
    "it is a rather simple interpretation which can be easily applied to minisuperspace models @xcite . in this case , the schrdinger equation is replaced by the wheeler - dewitt equation , and the quantum trajectories are the time evolutions of the metric and field variables , which obey a hamilton - jacobi equation with an extra quantum potential term .",
    "the application of this interpretation to some of the quantum solutions of our problem shows exactly the same behaviour as found previously : the bohmian trajectories behave classically for small values of the scale factor while the quantum behaviour appears when the scale factor becomes large .",
    "singularities are still present .",
    "however , when we make superpositions of these wave functions , the initial singularity disappears for some special cases , but none of these special trajectories grows to the size of our universe .",
    "the other case studied involves two minimally coupled scalar fields .",
    "they can be viewed as a tree level effective action of string theory where the second scalar field comes from the kalb - rammond field @xcite .",
    "they can also be understood as generalized brans - dicke type models , which can be derived from compactification of multidimensional theories with external gauge fields @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in this case were analogous to the preceding one .",
    "along the lines of the peak interpretation , gaussian wkb superpositions predicts a classical universe for small values of the scale factor because they are peaked around the classical trajectories in this region . adopting the causal interpretation to investigate the singularity problem , we found , as before , that many of the solutions present classical behaviour when the scale factor is small ( and hence singularities ) but behaves quantum mechanically when the scale factor becomes large .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we describe the classical minisuperspace models of both one and two scalar fields models , presenting their general classical solutions . in section 3",
    "we quantize these models obtaining their corresponding wheeler - dewitt equations and their respective general solutions . in section 4 , the gaussian superpositions of wkb solutions are constructed and their peak along the classical trajectories are exhibited . in section 5 , the causal interpretation of quantum cosmology is shortly reviewed and applied to the quantum solutions .",
    "we end with comments and conclusions .",
    "models with two scalar fields that interact non - trivially between themselves can be obtained from different theoretical contexts .",
    "considering kaluza - klein supergravity theories , keeping just the bosonic sector , and reducing to four dimensions , leads to effective actions with gravity plus two scalar fields , one of them coupled non - minimally to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian ; the two scalar fields have an interaction between them .",
    "more generally , every time we consider multidimensional models with gauge fields , and reduce them to four dimensions , we find such structure .",
    "string theories , in particular , have an effective action in four dimensions given by the expression , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a dilaton field and @xmath2 is a kalb - ramond field which in four dimensions is equivalent to a scalar field @xmath3    in order to keep contact with this variety of models , all of them having great importance in high energy conditions , we will consider the general lagrangian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a coupling constant .",
    "we remark the non - trivial interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath3 . for the string",
    "effective action , @xmath6 and for kaluza - klein theories @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the dimension of internal compact spacelike dimensions .",

    "the integration procedure is standard , and we just give the final results : @xmath24 in these expressions , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are integration constants .",
    "the universe expands from an initial singularity untill a maximum size and then contract to a final singularity .",

    "when @xmath29 is not small , the trajectories are not classical ( compare ( [ s3 ] ) with eqs .",
    "( [ flu1],[flu2],[flu3 ] ) ) .",
    "this can be seen by inspecting the quantum potential .",

    "in this domain , the kinetic terms dominate : @xmath242    hence the quantum potential becomes negligible when compared with the classical kinetic terms . for @xmath29",
    "not small , for instance , when @xmath243 yielding @xmath244 and @xmath245 , the quantum potential diverges , @xmath246 while the classical potential and kinetic terms behave like @xmath247 hence , together with @xmath248 , the quantum potential becomes the more important term .",
    "this behaviour of the quantum potential explains why the trajectories are classical for small @xmath29 and quantum otherwise .",
    "\\ii ) let us now take @xmath184 , @xmath220 , @xmath249 , @xmath227 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "then we obtain the following wave function ( see ref .",

    ", this can be explained by the behaviour of the quantum potential when compared with the kinetic and classical potential terms .",
    "the quantum potential is given by @xmath256 the kinetic and classical potential terms are given by , @xmath257 for small @xmath29 , @xmath176 , @xmath258 and @xmath259 goes to zero while @xmath260 and @xmath248 are constant . for large @xmath29 ,",
    "@xmath176 , @xmath261 and @xmath259 become comparable and large , while @xmath260 and @xmath248 continue to be constant . hence , in this situation , the quantum potential becomes important , driving the quantum behaviour of the bohmian trajectories .",
    "note that the sum of ( [ pq3 ] ) with ( [ s4 ] ) gives zero because the bohmian trajectories must satisfy the hamiltonian constraint ammended with the quantum potential term .",
    "we have also calculated the bohmian trajectories for other exact wave solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "all of them present the same behaviour .",
    "we conclude this section by stating that in quantum cosmology it is not necessary that the classical behaviour appears when @xmath29 is large , while quantum behaviour is present when @xmath29 is small",
    ". it can indeed be the reverse .",
    "this was already pointed out in @xcite and we presented specific examples illustrating this fact .",
    "it should also be commented that the result of this seciton using the causal interpretation are in qualitative agreement with the results of the previous section .",
    "in this paper , we have studied classical and quantum minisuperspace models containing one and two scalar fields .",
    "we have shown that all classical solutions are singular .",
    "after quantizing the models , we have obtained the general solution of the wheeler - de witt equation . usually , the solutions are oscillatory when the scale factor is small and not oscillatory when the scale factor becomes larger .",
    "this suggests that non - classical behaviour may occur when the sacale factor is large .",
    "we studied gaussian superpositions of wkb wave functions to investigate if they correspond to quasi - classical states , as suggested in ref .",
    "we have shown that indeed these wave functions are peaked around the classical trajectories in configuration space , but only for small @xmath29 .",
    "after , we applied the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics to these models . in this interpretation , it is possible to calculate quantum trajectories , independently of any observations .",
    "we have shown that the trajectories calculated following this interpretation usually present the classical behaviour when the scale factor is small and non - classical behaviour when @xmath29 is large , as suspected .",
    "this means that these quantum trajectories still presents an initial singularity .",
    "we have also seen that if we superpose negative with positive frequency solutions , then we can find trajectories which are no more classical for small @xmath29 .",
    "we can have eternal periodic quantum universes with very small oscilations .",
    "these universes , however , never scape the planck length",
    ". there are also singular solutions with a short period of inflation which grow forever .",
    "we could not find any non - singular solution which grows to the size of our universe , with a classical limit for large @xmath29 .",
    "the fact that quantum behaviour happens when @xmath29 is large is not surprising .",
    "it was already obtained in ref . @xcite and suggested to exist when the scale factor grows like @xmath262 in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is our case .",
    "hence , in quantum cosmology it is not necessarily true that large scale factors implies classical behaviour .",
    "for the scalar field models we have analyzed in this paper , the reverse seems to be more usual .",
    "it means that it is possible to have in our universe some degrees of freedom which still behave quantum mechanically in spite of it being very big .",
    "this gives us some hope of being possible to detect or experience quantum cosmological effects in the real universe we live in , bringing quantum cosmology to the realm of testable physical theories .",
    "the problem should be to find which degrees of freedom can possess this property . to do this ,",
    "we should improve this minisuperspace model with the accretion of small inhomogeneous perturbations , which contain an infinity number of degrees of freedom , and see what happens with the new inhomogeneous degrees of freedom .",
    "we will get closer to the real universe but we will have to face new technical and interpretational problems .",
    "this will be the subject of our future investigations .",
