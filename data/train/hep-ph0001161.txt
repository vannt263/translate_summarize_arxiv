    "possible parametrisations of the photon structure function which extend to the low @xmath1 region have also been discussed in ref .",
    "the parametrisation proposed in ref.@xcite is based upon the quark parton model supplemented by the contribution from the hadronic structure of the photon .",
    "the energy dependence of the latter has a regge form .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence is parametrised in terms of the simple form - factors which if combined with the regge - type energy dependence generate at large @xmath1 the bjorken scaling behaviour of the corresponding part of the structure function . in ref .",
    "@xcite the energy dependence of the cross - section is also parametrised in a regge - like form with the @xmath1 dependence specified by the suitable form factors which contain terms corresponding to the vmd contribution .",
    "the parametrisation discussed in @xcite is based upon a model corresponding to the interaction of colour dipoles , i.e. the @xmath22 pairs which the photon(s ) fluctuate into . in our approach the contribution coming from the light vector mesons within the vector meson dominance model is similar to that used by other authors ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) although the details concerning estimate of the relevant total cross - sections are slightly different .",
    "the novel feature of our model is the treatment of the contribution coming from high masses of the hadronic states which couple to the virtual photons . in our scheme",
    "this contribution is directly related to the photon structure function in the large @xmath1 region .",
    "the low and high mass hadronic states are separated at @xmath23 , a parameter whose value was taken identical with that for the @xmath24 .",
    "our framework permits to describe the @xmath25 and @xmath26 total cross sections as functions of energy .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath27 is also described by other models , @xcite .",
    "most of them incorporate the regge - like parametrisation of the total @xmath28 cross - sections ; some provide a detailed insight into the structure of final states and a decomposition of the @xmath29 total cross - section into terms corresponding to the appropriate subdivision of photon interactions and event classes @xcite .",
    "possibility that part of the @xmath28 cross - section is driven by the production of minijets has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "certain approaches analyse the behaviour of the cross - sections on the virtualities of both interacting photons @xcite .",
    "the content of our paper is as follows : in the next section we recall the qcd description of the photon structure functions and in section 3 we briefly describe the vector meson dominance model in the process @xmath30 . in section 4",
    "we present a parametrisation of the photon structure function , as well as the total cross section for the interaction of two real photons and of the virtual and real photon . in section 5",
    "we compare our theoretical predictions with the experimental data on the @xmath0 and on the total cross sections @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we also give predictions for @xmath3 in the very high energy range which can become accessible in future linear colliders .",
    "finally in section 6 we give the summary of our results .",
    "in the large @xmath1 , i.e. in the deep inelastic limit the virtual photon probes the quark ( antiquark ) structure of the ( real ) photon in analogy to the deep inelastic lepton  hadron scattering , fig.2 .    [",
    "fig : fig2 ]    the corresponding photon structure function @xmath18 may thus be related to quark and antiquark distributions @xmath31 , @xmath32 in the photon : f_2^(x , q^2 ) = x _ i e_i^2 [ q_i^(x , q^2 ) + |q_i^(x , q^2 ) ] , [ eq : a1 ] where @xmath33 denote the charges of quarks and antiquarks and the sum is over all active quark flavours . to be precise equation ( [ eq : a1 ] ) holds in leading logarithmic approximation of perturbative qcd .",
    "it acquires higher order corrections in next - to - leading approximation and beyond @xcite .",
    "a special feature of the quark structure of the photon with respect to the proton is a possibility of a direct @xmath34 production through the process @xmath35 , see fig.3 , leading to the parton model predictions for the @xmath36 and @xmath37 . a contribution of this process introduces an inhomogeneous term into the equation describing the qcd evolution of the quark ( and antiquark ) distributions in the photon .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ]    the process @xmath35 ( modified by the qcd evolution ) with the pointlike quark coupling both to real and virtual photons dominates in the large @xmath1 limit making the photon structure functions exactly calculable in this limit @xcite .",
    "striking features of these functions are :    * @xmath38 rise with increasing @xmath2 at large @xmath2 ; * @xmath38 show the scaling violation , @xmath39 .    at low values of @xmath2",
    "the dominant role in the photon structure functions is played by gluons .",
    "the situation here is similar to that of the hadronic structure functions which exhibit a very strong increase with decreasing @xmath2 , see e.g. @xcite . those effects are still rather weak in the kinematical region of @xmath5 probed by present experiments but they will be very important in the regime accessible in the future linear @xmath40 ( @xmath41 , @xmath25 ) colliders @xcite .",
    "besides the direct , point - like coupling to quarks , the target photon can fluctuate into vector mesons and other hadronic states which can also have their partonic structure .",
    "the latter can not be calculated perturbatively and thus has to be parametrised phenomenologically @xcite .",
    "finally it should be pointed out that the charm quark playing the dominant role in the heavy quark contributions to @xmath18 , is often described just by the lowest order bethe - heitler cross - section for the process @xmath42 and the additional contribution generated by the radiation @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the qcd describes the photon structure functions in the large @xmath1 region . in the low @xmath1 region",
    "however one expects that the vmd mechanism is important . by the vector meson dominance mechanism in this case",
    "we understand the model in which the virtual photon of virtuality @xmath1 fluctuates into vector mesons which next undergo interaction with the ( real ) photon of virtuality @xmath47 , see fig.4 . in order to be able to describe the photon structure function for arbitrary values of @xmath1",
    "it would be very useful to have a unifed scheme which contains both the vmd and the qcd contributions , the latter suitably extended to the region of low values of @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ]    this may be achieved by utilising the dispersive representation in @xmath1 of the structure function . to this aim",
    "let us notice that the @xmath44 collision can be viewed as the interaction of a real photon target with a photon with virtuality @xmath1 which fluctuates onto general hadronic state , cf .",
    "we consider the virtual photon first fluctuating onto the @xmath48 state and then interacting with the real photon . like in the @xmath49 scattering one can write the dispersion relation for the @xmath44 scattering as follows @xcite : @xmath50 _ q ( m^2 , m^2 ) a_(q ) - ( w^2 , m^2 , m^2 ) [ eq : aa1 ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the invariant masses of the incoming and outgoing @xmath48 pair . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : aa1 ] ) , @xmath53 is the density matrix of the @xmath48 states and @xmath54 is an imaginary part of the corresponding forward scattering amplitude .",
    "the above formula can be rewritten in a form of a single dispersion relation as follows , [ a2 ] f_2^(w^2 , q^2 ) = q^2 _ 0^ ( w^2 , q^2 ) where the spectral function ( w^2,q^2 ) & = & 1 4 ^2 _ 0 ^ 1 d dm^2 dm^2 ( q^2-m^2-(1- ) m^2 ) + & & ( m^2,m^2 ) a_(q|q)-(w^2,m^2,m^2 ) .",
    "[ sindisp ]    the centre - of - mass energy squared @xmath55 is related to the bjorken parameter @xmath2 in the following way : w^2 = q^2 ( 1 x - 1 ) .",
    "one can now separate regions of low- and high values of @xmath56 in the integral ( [ a2 ] ) , by noticing that this integral corresponds to the ( generalised ) vector meson dominance representation of the @xmath5 .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ]    for low values of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , one uses the vector meson dominance model . in this approach",
    "one assumes that the virtual photon forms a vector meson rather than a pair of well separated @xmath58 .",
    "the integrand in the integral on the right hand side of equation ( [ sindisp ] ) defining the spectral function @xmath59 is then given by the following formula : @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the mass of the vector meson @xmath63 and @xmath64 denotes the @xmath65 total cross section .",
    "the couplings @xmath66 can be estimated from the leptonic widths of the vector mesons , @xmath67 in equation ( [ spfvm ] ) we have included only diagonal transitions between the vector mesons having the same masses .",
    "the corresponding spectral function @xmath68 thus reads : @xmath69 the resulting vmd contribution to the photon structure function @xmath0 , @xmath70 , is given by the following equation : [ eq : a2 ] f_2^vmd ( x , q^2 ) = _ v .    in eq.([eq :",
    "a2 ] ) we only consider mesons with masses @xmath71 .",
    "the contribution coming from the region of high values of @xmath56 ( @xmath72 ) can be related to the photon structure function from the large @xmath1 domain .",

    "the structure function @xmath74 is taken from the qcd analysis , valid in the large @xmath1 region , i.e. it is calculated from the existing parametrisations of the parton distributions .",
    "modifications of the qcd contribution : replacement of the parameter @xmath2 by @xmath75 defined in equation ( [ xbar ] ) , shift of the scale @xmath76 and the factor @xmath77 instead of 1 , introduce power corrections which vanish as @xmath78 and are negligible at large @xmath1 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath79 is set to @xmath80 as in the case of the proton @xcite .",
    "the @xmath73 thus defines a contribution to @xmath5 at arbitrary low values of @xmath1 .",
    "an elaborated treatment of the partonic contribution to the proton structure function has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where long and short distance components have been carefully separated .",
    "according to that paper the low mass region is dominated by the @xmath48 pairs with large transverse sizes in the impact parameter space ( thus corresponding to the vmd ) whereas the qcd part is dominated by pairs of small transverse size .",
    "our representation of the photon structure function @xmath81 is based on the following decomposition : @xmath82 where @xmath70 and @xmath83 are defined by eq .",

    "it should be noted that the vmd part contains only finite number of vector mesons with their masses smaller than @xmath79 .    in the quantitive analysis of the photon structure function and of the total cross sections we have taken the structure function @xmath74 from the lo analyses presented in ref .",

    "pomeron couplings @xmath98 are related to the corresponding couplings @xmath99 controlling the pomeron contributions to the total @xmath100 cross - sections .",
    "we assume the additive quark model and reduce the total cross - sections for the interaction of strange quarks by a factor 2 .",

    "irregular behaviour of the dashed lines observed in figs 6 and 7 at high values of @xmath2 is connected with the teatment of the charm contribution to @xmath5 in the grs approach .    in fig.8",

    "does also exhibit stronger increase with the increasing energy than that of the vmd component .",
    "it is however milder than the increase generated by the partonic component alone , at least for @xmath122 gev .",
