    "recent progress in calculating pulsar magnetospheres ( spitkovsky 2006 and references therein ) is based on force - free electrodynamics ( ffe ) .",
    "ffe describes electromagnetic fields of special geometry  at each event , the electric field is smaller than and perpendicular to the magnetic field . when applied to pulsars",
    ", ffe predicts a singular current layer along the magnetic separatrix surface . within the light cylinder ,",
    "the singularity is of an admissible type  although the current is singular , the electric field remains smaller than and perpendicular to the magnetic field . outside the light cylinder",
    ", the singularity actually violates the ffe equations . for this reason , and also to understand dissipation processes leading to the observed radiation , one wants to use a dissipative generalization of ffe . such a theory ",
    "strong - field electrodynamics ( sfe )  has recently been proposed ( gruzinov 2008 ) .",
    "sfe describes electromagnetic fields of arbitrary geometry .",
    "sfe is maxwell theory with the semi - dissipative lorentz - covariant ohm s law @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the charge density , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 represent the field invariants , and @xmath5 .",
    "the conductivity scalar @xmath6 is an arbitrary function of the field invariants .",
    "sfe comes from the following simple postulate : at each event , in the frame where the electric field is parallel to the magnetic field and the charge density vanishes , the current @xmath7 flows along the fields .. covariant formulation of sfe is @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( compare to ffe : @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "we simulated time - dependent axisymmetric maxwell equations with the sfe ohm s law .",
    "we used the regularization described in ( gruzinov 2008 ) , and checked that the results are independent of the regularization to the specified accuracy .",
    "the initial field was vacuum around the rotating magnetized neutron star .",
    "in spherical coordinates , in pulsar units ( @xmath12 ) , the vacuum field is given by the magnetic stream function @xmath13 and the electrostatic potential @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the radius of the star .",
    "we then evolved the three components of the electric field @xmath16 , the magnetic stream function @xmath17 , and the toroidal magnetic field @xmath18 .",
    "the boundary conditions on the surface of the star are @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we show the magnetosphere at @xmath21 , when the field configuration within @xmath22 ( two light cylinders ) saturates .",
    "the outer boundary was at @xmath23  out of causal contact with the @xmath24 zone .",
    "the saturated electric field is potential .",
    "the saturated toroidal field is given by the poloidal current @xmath25 .",
    "we show two cases .",
