    "since the experimental results implying that the neutrinos are massive @xcite , it is expected to have cp violation phases in the leptonic sector .",
    "however , the situation in the lepton*ic * sector is very different from the quark sector where the cp violation is clearly established in @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons physics .",
    "the only evidence for flavor violation in the leptonic sector comes from neutrino oscillations and there is , so far , no confirmation for cp violation in leptonic decays .",
    "hence , measuring any cp asymmetry in neutrino oscillation will open a new window to study cp violation and related problems as leptogenesis or cp violation in @xmath2 decays .",
    "new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , like low energy supersymmetry , may be probed at the lhc and consequently new sources of cp and flavor violation can be expected .",
    "these new sources of cp and lepton flavor violation , also classified as non - standard interactions ( nsi ) , could give important contributions to the cp asymmetry in neutrino oscillation ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in addition , a proper procedure to take into account these non - standard interactions is important as neutrino experiments are reaching a high level of accuracy .",
    "even if neutrino masses and lepton mixing matrices solve the solar and atmospheric neutrinos anomalies , it is clear that nsi could affect the oscillations parameters as determined by the next generation of neutrino experiments .",
    "effects of nsi have been widely studied , considering their contributions to solar and atmospheric neutrino problems , in neutrinos factories , in conventional and upgraded neutrino beta beams , @xmath3 colliders , neutrino - electron and neutrino - nucleus scattering and in many other aspects of neutrino physics @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of a possible cp asymmetry in neutrino oscillation due to the sm or nsi is still an open question .",
    "the following two hypothesis are usually considered in the analysis of cp asymmetry in neutrino oscillations : @xmath4 the probability of a process associated to neutrino oscillation can be factorized into three independent parts : the production process , the oscillation probability and the detection cross section . @xmath5",
    "the cp asymmetry in this process is due to the cp violating phase in the lepton mixing matrix . in a pioneering work ,",
    "the authors of ref . @xcite have studied cp violating effects due to contributions from new neutrino interactions in the production and/or detection processes in neutrino oscillation experiments . however , only corrections to the v - a sm charged current interactions were considered @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the ( v - a)(v - a ) and ( v - a)(v+a ) operators associated to muon decays , but not to the pion decay , have been considered . in muon",
    "decays , the interference between sm and new physics of ( v - a)(v+a ) operators is suppressed by @xmath6 .. ] in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quantum field theory formalism has been used to describe neutrino oscillations but new flavour interactions were not taken into account .",
    "the goal of this paper is to go beyond this approximation and to propose a generic framework based on quantum field theory to get a simple expression for the cp asymmetry without imposing any assumptions on the operators generated by new physics .",
    "we shall show that in such a case , new contributions to the cp asymmetry appear and it could be important to take them into account once we want to constraint new physics using experimental data .",
    "we shall illustrate this in the case of the supersymmetric extension of the standard model but it is clear that our treatment is valid beyond that and it can be applied to nsi effects in all neutrino experiments .",
    "let us start by giving a sketch of the idea of the present work .",
    "let us consider a virtual neutrino that is produced at the space - time location @xmath7 , travels to @xmath8 and is detected there because it interacts with a target producing a charged lepton @xmath9 . for definiteness , we illustrate this process with the production of the neutrino in @xmath10 decay and its later detection via its weak interaction with a target nucleon @xmath11 ( see figure 1 ) : @xmath12 we shall call @xmath13 state , respectively the neutrino which is produced at source in conjunction of a @xmath14 and the neutrino which is detected through the detection of a charged lepton of flavour @xmath9 .",
    "these effective states are not necessary of @xmath15 or @xmath9 flavour once nsi are introduced .",
    "followed by the detection process:@xmath16 .",
    "it is important to recall that the flavour of neutrino intermediary state is unobservable.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] +    energy - momentum conservation at the production and detection vertices requires @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "weak interactions in the sm acting at the production and detection vertices conserve lepton number and this process is interpreted as a flavor change : a @xmath15-neutrino is transformed into a @xmath9-neutrino due to oscillation .",
    "however , in the presence of new physics flavor violating weak interactions can occur , and the flavor identification of the neutrino at the production and/or decay locations via its associated charged lepton is not unique anymore .",
    "this process is relevant for neutrino factories and long - baseline accelerator experiments such as superbeams .",
    "pions are produced at the source when a high - energy proton beam ( @xmath19 ) hits a target ( made of solid dense material e.g. be , al , ca , etc ... ) .",
    "superbeam neutrino sources are mainly from pion decays while neutrino factories sources are mainly from muons .",
    "if we assume that light neutrinos are left - handed , lepton flavor ( lf)-violating semi - leptonic interactions can be described by the following effective hamiltonian :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 runs over the three leptonic flavors and @xmath22 .    in the following and for simplicity , we consider the case where lf violation occurs only at the @xmath10 decay vertex .",
    "it is straighforward to include the effects of such new physics at the detection vertex using this formalism .",
    "note that the tensor currents proportional to the @xmath23 wilson coefficients will not contribute to @xmath10 decay because it is not possible to generate an antisymmetric tensor from the pion momentum alone .",
    "thus , the only non - vanishing hadronic matrix elements at the production vertex are : @xmath24 where @xmath25 mev is the pion decay constant and @xmath26 denote the light quark masses .    using the relation @xmath27 between flavor @xmath21 and mass @xmath28 neutrino eigenstates , we get the following amplitude for @xmath10 decay : @xmath29 where : @xmath30 with @xmath31 . now consider a neutrino of flavor @xmath21 that is produced in @xmath10 decay via lf - violating interactions and is detected with flavor @xmath9 at a later time via ( lf - conserving ) charged current scattering off the nucleon @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in quantum field formalism",
    ", the s - matrix amplitude for the evolution for the system from initial state is given by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 basically describes oscillation of neutrinos during its propagation .",
    "it is important to stress that we never introduce energy - momentum eigenstates to describe the neutrinos as in our formalism the neutrinos appear as virtual particles . in terms of massive neutrino propagators",
    "we can write @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the usual elements of the @xmath36 mixing matrix .",
    "we write this propagator in a more convenient form by integrating upon the time component of the four - momentum @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 . as usual , we interpret the first term as neutrinos propagating forwards in time and the second as anti - neutrinos propagating backwards in time .",
    "thus , by keeping only the first term of the propagator in eq .",
    "( 6 ) we get the amplitude @xmath39 with @xmath40 is the time elapsed from the production to the detection space - time locations of neutrinos and @xmath41 .",
    "equivalently , the time - dependent amplitude from initial to final states is the integrand of eq.(7 ) : @xmath42 where @xmath43 \\ , \\\\",
    "a_k&\\equiv & \\frac { m_{\\pi}}{m_u+m_d}(c_3^{k*}-c_4^{k*})\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the time evolution amplitude for the corresponding cp - conjugate process which correspond to the observation at source of a @xmath44 and detection of a @xmath45 is given by : @xmath46    in order to get the cp asymmetry in the general case , let us choose the following form of the nucleon weak vertex : @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xcite . under these approximations ,",
    "one has : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a kinematical function that depends on masses and momenta of external particles but not on neutrino flavour and will drop in the @xmath52 asymmetry defined as : @xmath53",
    ".    in the usual formalism developed by refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite one considers only new physics corrections due to @xmath56 . in this approximation , one gets for the amplitude @xmath57 once taking the @xmath58 , the first two lines of the previous equation will give us the kinematical part of the process which is common to all neutrino flavor and the last line will give , at first order in neutrino masses , the usual neutrino oscillation results including non standard interactions .",
    "it is interesting to note the equivalence of our expression with the approach done in ref.@xcite where they defined : @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the neutrino mass eigenstates and @xmath61 is the initial flavour state produced at neutrino source .",
    "computing @xmath62 , one obtains the neutrino oscillation part of @xmath63 once assuming that @xmath64 and keeping the first term of the expansion in @xmath65 .",
    "the interesting results of this formalism is that naturally all nsi can be taken into account without making any a priori assumptions . in particular",
    ", one can easily include the effects of new cp violating phases and flavour - violating interactions from @xmath66 wilson coefficients which involve scalar and pseudoscalar density operators .",
    "as an example , let us assume that the only sources of cp violating phases are coming from the scalar operators @xmath67 ( equivalently a relative weak phase between @xmath68 and @xmath69 , different from @xmath70 ) , so the numerator of the cp asymmetry will be proportional to @xmath71 the standard model contributes only to @xmath72 corrections from new physics ( in our convention , @xmath73 ) and @xmath66 are produced by new physics . at first order in new physics",
    ", one has to replace @xmath74 by @xmath75 in the cp asymmetry as previously defined .",
    "it is interesting to note that we could get this result by assuming from the beginning that @xmath76 where one defines the @xmath59 with @xmath77 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that using the qft formalism , all @xmath78 are expressed in terms of the wilson coefficients and once the @xmath78 are defined , the analysis considered in ref.@xcite can be easily implemented .",
    "as one can see from eq.(11 ) , the new physics is enhanced by a factor * @xmath79 * which multiplies the wilson coefficients @xmath80 as mentionned previously in refs.@xcite@xcite .",
    "it is clear that the limit on helicity of the muon in pion decays @xcite@xcite will constraint the contribution of @xmath66 not to be bigger than a few percent .",
    "it is important to note that most of the constraints on @xmath81 come from four lepton fermi operators ( see ref.@xcite ) as in @xmath82 or rare muon decays as @xmath83 ; also some lepton flavour violating tau decays impose very strong constraints on @xmath84 with @xmath85 or @xmath2 . in the case of operators which contribute to pion decays , one should note that these operators can be written as the product of a leptonic current and a hadronic current .",
    "thus , the wilson coefficents in both cases can not be related to each other unless they can be factorized into the product of a leptonic and a hadronic part and if cp and flavor violations occur only in the leptonic vertices .",
    "this procedure is model - dependent and should be verified in each specific model of new flavour interactions .",
    "let us apply this formalism to the usual minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm . hence , as an application",
    ", we calculate the supersymmetric ( susy ) contributions to the dominant pion decay mode @xmath86 ( or its charge conjugate ) @xcite through the wilson coefficients and focus our attention on the susy constributions to scalars and pseudoscalars wilson coefficients ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) .",
    "the effective lagrangian contributing to the @xmath89 flavor change at the neutrino source , is given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 are the dimensionless wilson coefficients and @xmath92 are the relevant local operators at low energy scale as defined in eq.(2 ) .",
    "the leading order contributions to @xmath87 and @xmath88 under the experimental constraints for the wilson coefficients induced by susy are explicitly shown in the expressions below .",
    "these describe box type diagrams of chargino - neutralino exchanges . other susy contributions ( vertex corrections )",
    "are suppressed by the yukawa couplings of light leptons . in fig ( [ fig2 ] ) , the feynman diagrams of dominant susy contribution to the pion decay , @xmath93 , are represented .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    to simplify the expression , we shall assume that the squark and slepton masses are degenerated ( @xmath94)@xcite : @xmath95 @xmath96 where the @xmath11 and @xmath97 matrices are the matrices which respectively diagonalize the neutralinos and chargino mass matrices , @xmath98 is the gauge weak coupling and @xmath99 is the weinberg angle .",
    "the sum on @xmath100 is respectively on the squarks , sleptons , charginos and neutralinos .",
    "the functions @xmath101 are given by @xmath102 and @xmath103 are defined as @xmath104 . in order to have non - vanishing asymmetry we should have a non - vanishing imaginary part of @xmath87 or @xmath88 . the complex phase of @xmath66 can be due to the matrices that diagonalize the squark mass matrix or the chargino mass matrix .",
    "if we assume that the squark matrices are diagonal , i.e the diagonalizing matrices are identity , we do not have any source of cp violation from squark matrices .",
    "then the only remaining source is the phase of @xmath15 which induces a complex phase in chargino mass matrix and hence @xmath105 and @xmath106 unitary matrices .",
    "this phase is strongly constrained by the neutron electric dipole moment ( edm)@xcite but it is possible to avoid this constraint if the first generation of squarks are heavy enough and decouple from the two other squark generations . another way to avoid the neutron edm constraint is to assume flavor violating structure in the squarks and sleptons mass matrices .",
    "this allows to have new sources of cp violation which could contribute to any cp violating observables and/or could relax the constraint on the @xmath15 term coming from neutron edm limit@xcite .    assuming that the cp violating sources comes from the @xmath15 term in the chargino sector , @xmath107 is given by @xmath66 times the enhancement factor @xmath108 . for typical chargino and neutralino masses of order 150 gev and sfermion masses around 100 gev ,",
    "it is possible to obtain @xmath107 as large as @xmath109 . in order to maximize the absolute values of @xmath110 s",
    ", one assumes that charginos and neutralinos have quasi - degenerated masses . in figure ( [ fig3 ] ) , we present our numerical results for @xmath111 ( solid line ) and @xmath112 ( dashed and dotted lines ) as function of the chargino mass , for @xmath113 and @xmath114 . as expected from the expressions of @xmath66 , @xmath107 is not sensitive to @xmath115 if @xmath116 .",
    "one should emphasize that the susy model presented in this section is the simplest one and we could expect enhancement in flavour violation effects once a non - universal structure is assumed in the soft - susy breaking terms . in this case , the values of @xmath117 or / and @xmath118 may be significantly enhanced .",
    "a detailed analysis for the cp asymmetry in neutrino oscillation in susy model with non - minimual flavor will be considered elsewhere .    as one can see from fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) , @xmath117 is typically of order @xmath109 . these values lead to cp asymmetry in neutrino oscillation of order @xmath119 , depending of the parameters of the neutrino beam and the size of the experiment baseline @xcite .",
    "such asymmetries are reachable at next generation of reactor and beam neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite .",
    "( solid line ) and @xmath118 ( dashed and dotted lines ) for different choice of @xmath115 , respectively @xmath113 and @xmath120 .",
    "the other parameters are given by @xmath121 gev and @xmath122 gev.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +",
    "to conclude , we proposed a formalism based on quantum field theory where it is possible to include all sources of non standard interactions including new cp- and flavour - violating interactions . we show that using this method , it is straightforward to include the effects of the scalar and pseudoscalar operators densities which appears in any new physics models . in the limit where we consider only ( v - a)(v - a ) operator , we reproduce the usual results reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that most of the studies on nsi in neutrino physics have been done assuming that new physics contributions to neutrino interactions is mainly due to corrections to ( v - a)(v - a ) wilson coefficients .",
    "this approach was well justified when neutrino experiments were not so accurate and other sources of new physics could be easily neglected . but",
    "now neutrino experiments enter in the field of high precision experiments where the effects of nsi coming from ( s - p)(s+p ) and ( s - p)(s - p ) operators could have an impact on the determination of lepton mixing parameters including the cp violating phases . to illustrate our results , we applied it to susy models where we assume that the only cp - violating phases appear in @xmath66 wilson coefficients which correspond respectively to ( s - p)(s - p ) and ( s - p)(s+p ) operators .",
    "in such a case , we show that with reasonable values for the susy parameters , it is possible to generate a cp asymmetry as large as @xmath119 .",
