    "interface roughening is a phenomenon which has attracted interest of experimental and theoretical investigators , see e.g.  @xcite , since its discovery @xcite .",
    "it is displayed by interfaces , separating different coexisting phases or substances of a system of statistical physics , in a range of temperatures @xmath0 between the roughening temperature @xmath1 and the critical temperature @xmath2 .",
    "roughening manifests itself in a characteristic dependence of the interface width on the system size . for an interface of diameter @xmath3",
    "the width increases logarithmically with @xmath3 in the rough phase , whereas it remains constant of the order of the correlation length @xmath4 for temperatures below @xmath1 .",
    "this effect is commonly described theoretically in terms of the capillary wave model or drumhead model @xcite . in this model",
    "the interface is represented in an idealized way by an infinitely thin fluctuating membrane , so that the instantaneous microscopic interface profile is a sharp step function between the two phases .",
    "nevertheless , in the thermal average the capillary wave fluctuations produce a continuous density profile with a finite width @xmath5 , which can be shown to be given by an integral over all wave - numbers of the fluctuations , which is essentially of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of dimensions of space and @xmath8 is the interface tension . a natural lower limit on the wave numbers",
    "is given by the system size , @xmath9 in order to avoid the divergence of the integral , an upper cut - off @xmath10 has to be introduced .",
    "as there should be no waves with wavelength smaller than the intrinsic width of the physical interface , the upper cut - off is taken to be of the order of the inverse correlation length . in the case of @xmath11 ,",
    "considered here , one obtains @xmath12 with an unknown constant @xmath13 .",
    "the logarithmic increase with @xmath3 is due to the contribution of capillary waves with long wavelengths near the system size @xmath3 .",
    "complementary to the capillary wave model is the mean field description of interfaces . in mean field theory and its field theoretic refinements ,",
    "interfaces possess an intrinsic continuous profile with a well - defined width , which is proportional to the bulk correlation length and does not depend on the system size",
    ".    mean field and capillary wave theory can be combined in the `` convolution approximation '' @xcite . in this picture",
    "the intrinsic profile describes the interface on a microscopic scale of the order of the correlation length , while capillary wave theory describes the macroscopic interface fluctuations of wavelengths much larger than the correlation length .",
    "the intrinsic profile is thus centered around a two - dimensional surface subject to capillary wave fluctuations . in the convolution approximation the square of the resulting total interface width",
    "is obtained as a sum of the intrinsic part and the capillary wave contribution , @xmath14    the description of rough interfaces by means of the capillary wave model and the convolution approximation is unsatisfactory for different reasons .",
    "first of all , it has so far not been possible to define the concept of an intrinsic interface profile and width unambiguously outside a given theory . in experiments or monte carlo simulations of systems with interfaces ,",
    "the observed interface profile and width are the total ones , including the effects of the intrinsic structure as well as of the capillary waves , and there is no clear way to separate the intrinsic structure from the effects of capillary waves .",
    "secondly , the models sketched above contain ad hoc constants , whose numerical values are arbitrary and can not be fixed unambiguously within the models .    in this article",
    "we investigate the profile and width of rough interfaces in a coherent approach from first principles .",
    "statistical systems with coexisting phases , separated by interfaces , are described in the framework of the field theoretic version of the landau - ginzburg model , including fluctuations on all length scales .",
    "no cut - off on wave - numbers is introduced . for explicit calculations we employ the one - loop approximation",
    ". it should be noted , however , that an extension to arbitrary higher loop orders is possible in principle .",
    "the interface profile , resulting from the calculation , shows the expected logarithmic broadening with the system size @xmath3 .",
    "we obtain analytical results for the numerical coefficients , which are fixed unambiguously in this approach .",
    "interfaces have been studied before in the framework of field theory by other authors . in @xcite the profile",
    "is calculated to first order in the @xmath15-expansion , where @xmath16 and an extrapolation to @xmath17 is necessary .",
    "the @xmath15-expansion is an expansion around the four - dimensional case . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ cwintegral ] ) , in four dimensions the contribution of long - wavelength modes converges and no roughening is present .",
    "this has the consequence that within the @xmath15-expansion , even after extrapolation to @xmath11 dimensions , roughening effects do not show up , as is well known .",
    "the calculation of @xcite is extended to include the effects of an external field in @xcite .",
    "our calculations are performed in @xmath11 physical dimensions in contrast to the @xmath15-expansion .",
    "the three - dimensional approach is based on a systematic expansion in a dimensionless coupling @xcite .",
    "ultraviolet divergences are treated by dimensional regularization ( @xmath18 ) , which does not vitiate the fact that the results for physical quantities strictly refer to @xmath11 dimensions .",
    "this is also seen explicitly by the fact that the calculation reveals the typical roughening effects .",
    "renormalization of the three - dimensional field theory is performed in the scheme used in @xcite to two - loop order , employing the results of @xcite .",
    "a three - dimensional study has previously been done in @xcite , where the interface profile is considered in @xmath11 dimensions at one - loop order in the presence of an external gravitational field .",
    "a functional form of the profile is given , including capillary wave effects .",
    "the dependence on the system size is , however , not considered .",
    "we shall compare our results with the ones of @xcite below .",
    "in the framework of field theory , the system under consideration , possessing interfaces , is described by an order parameter field @xmath19 representing the difference between the concentrations of the two coexisting phases .",
    "the physics of the system is governed by the landau - ginzburg hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath20 = \\int\\!\\!d^3x\\,\\mathcal{h}(\\phi(x))\\ ] ] with the hamiltonian density @xmath21 in the situation with interfaces the potential is of the double - well type , @xmath22    mean field theory amounts to the classical approximation where fluctuations are neglected .",
    "the minima of the potential then correspond to the two homogeneous phases .",
    "the mean field correlation length @xmath23 is defined through the second moment of the correlation function in the mean field approximation .",
    "it is given by the second derivative of the potential in its minima : @xmath24 with the bare mass @xmath25 , defined by @xmath26 the hamiltonian density can be written as @xmath27    the simplest description of interfaces is also based on mean field theory @xcite . in this approximation",
    "the interface profile is given by minimization of the hamiltonian @xmath28 with boundary conditions appropriate for an interface .",
    "the corresponding field equation @xmath29 leads to the differential equation @xmath30 if we choose the interface to be perpendicular to the @xmath31-axis , we find the typical hyperbolic tangent profile @xcite @xmath32 its width is proportional to the mean field correlation length @xmath23 .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 specifies the location of the interface .",
    "essential for a field theoretic treatment , as being considered in this article , are corrections to mean field theory coming from fluctuations of the order parameter field .",
    "they can be calculated systematically in renormalized perturbation theory .",
    "the fluctuations result in different modifications of the mean field result , as will be considered in detail below .",
    "first of all , higher order corrections change the form of the profile from the tanh - function to a different function .",
    "secondly , renormalization of the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath23 becomes necessary and , as a result , the mean field correlation length @xmath23 is replaced by the physical correlation length @xmath4 , which diverges near the critical point with a characteristic exponent @xmath35 .",
    "finally , long - wavelength fluctuations lead to the roughening phenomenon , which implies a broadening of the interface , such that its width depends logarithmically on the system size and diverges in the limit of an infinite system .",
    "the partition function for the system with an interface can be written as a functional integral of the form @xmath36)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is a classical interface solution as given above and @xmath38 denotes the fluctuations around it .",
    "the hamiltonian density , expressed in terms of @xmath39 , reads @xmath40 here the operator @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the laplacean .    in the loop expansion the quadratic terms in @xmath44",
    "are treated by means of gaussian functional integrals , and the higher order terms are taken into account by taylor expansions .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath41 is known analytically @xcite .",
    "we have to employ it for our calculation and give details below . at this point",
    "we would like to draw the attention to the fact that @xmath41 has a single zero mode @xmath45 the zero mode of the fluctuation operator is directly related to translations of the interface , as parameterized by the parameter @xmath33 . for every value of this parameter ,",
    "the function @xmath46 is a solution of the classical field equation .",
    "this implies that @xmath47 is a zero mode of @xmath41 .",
    "the existence of a zero mode requires to treat the corresponding fluctuations , which are proportional to @xmath48 , separately from the remaining gaussian integrals in the functional integrals .",
    "this is done by the method of collective coordinates @xcite .",
    "the collective coordinate in question is @xmath33 . in",

    ". therefore integration over @xmath33 has to be omitted , leaving us with gaussian integrals over @xmath50 .",

    "another definition of the interface width is more convenient , namely choosing @xmath127 which is meaningful as long as the profile function is monotonic . for this choice , in the convolution approximation",
    "the squared width @xmath128 of the interface equals the sum of the intrinsic and the capillary wave contributions , see eq .",

    "the @xmath3-independent term @xmath132 contains the classical mean field value @xmath133 see @xcite , plus corrections , which are undetermined in the convolution approximation .    for both choices of the weight function @xmath119 ,",
    "the one - loop approximation ceases to be valid , if @xmath3 gets so large that @xmath119 becomes negative .",
    "this happens for @xmath134 , which coincides with the value , where the profile begins to be non - monotonic .",
    "interfaces have been investigated in the three - dimensional ising model by means of monte carlo calculations in @xcite .",
    "to observe roughening in monte carlo is delicate , nevertheless one can obtain estimates for the offset @xmath132 from their data , which amount to @xmath135 @xcite , @xmath136 @xcite , @xmath137 @xcite and @xmath138 @xcite . in view of the spread of these numbers , and in view of the fact that higher - loop contributions will change our estimate , we can only notice that the order of magnitude is compatible with our result .",
    "field theory , in the form of the landau - ginzburg model , including thermal fluctuations on all length scales , allows to determine the interface profile and interface width for models in the ising universality class in the critical region . for a system possessing a square interface of size @xmath139 we derived the conditional equation for the interface profile in the one - loop approximation .",
    "we obtained its solution in analytical form . when it is expressed in terms of physical , renormalized parameters ,",
    "no divergences occur , and there is no need to introduce ad hoc cut - offs as in the capillary wave model .",
