    "the best opportunity for the investigation of interactions between electrons and optical phonons is provided by coupled phonon - plasmon modes in doped semiconductors ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "two such modes @xmath4 have been observed in raman experiments for many semiconductors . on the early step ,",
