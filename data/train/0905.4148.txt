    "the computation of real - time correlation functions in condensed phase quantum systems is a challenging problem for which there is no universally applicable approach .",
    "this fact has necessitated the development of a variety of powerful methods ranging from exact numerical approaches to approximate theories.@xcite the choice of method will in general depend on the type , dimensionality , and size of the system of interest as well as the external thermodynamic conditions under consideration .",
    "the problems that plague exact real - time approaches are generally absent in imaginary time.@xcite the dynamical sign problem , which renders most direct real time monte carlo simulations infeasible , is avoided in imaginary time . in principle , this means that a well defined wick rotation may be used to recover real time information and excitation spectra.@xcite if the precise analytical form of the correlation function is known in imaginary time , rotation in the complex time plane is straight forward .",
    "however in most cases of interest the imaginary time correlation function must be determined numerically via quantum monte carlo . in practice ,",
    "analytic continuation in this case is numerically unstable and highly sensitive to statistical error.@xcite    the most commonly used technique for the numerical analytical continuation of imaginary time quantum monte carlo data is the maximum entropy ( maxent ) method.@xcite in maxent , the optimal fit of the data is defined in a bayesian manner as the most likely fit that emerges from the competition between the @xmath0 goodness - of - fit and an entropic prior @xmath1 .",
    "maxent generally requires an additional means to determine the prefactor @xmath2 ( `` temperature '' ) of the entropy term .",
    "once determined , maxent provides a statistically rigorous and unique fit for the spectral function .",
    "the strength of the maxent method is that it generally provides good estimates of spectral area in the correct region of frequency space .",
    "however numerous studies have shown that , in general , maxent solutions tend to be too broad and smooth and often lack clearly defined peaks.@xcite other approaches have been devised to overcome this `` smoothness '' problem but these approaches have not met with much general success .    while maxent provides a bayesian estimate of the most likely fit , a different approach may be devised based on the notion of averaging over a sequence of possible solutions .",
    "such approaches are called stochastic analytic continuation methods or average spectrum methods ( asm).@xcite one justification for such a procedure is the fact that maxent solutions for different values of @xmath2 may have spurious features that vanish or are diminished when averaged .",
    "this type of approach was independently suggested for the continuation of imaginary time quantum monte carlo data by white and sandvik,@xcite while similar ideas have been used in other fields.@xcite while these methods have been put forward on rather heuristic grounds , the results generated in several studies give support to the notion that features not detected by maxent may be faithfully revealed .",
    "beach has provided a more secure theoretical foundation for such an approach by constructing a version of an asm for which maxent is the mean field limit.@xcite thus , one may view the asm as including fluctuations not incorporated in the maxent method .    in this work , we will use a variant of the asm approach outlined by slyjuasen  @xcite to calculate the dynamic structure factor of both liquid _",
    "ortho_-deuterium and liquid _ para_-hydrogen .",
    "such cases are useful because extensive experimental results exist in these systems that show features that are not captured by maxent . while the asm approach used here is more computationally demanding than maxent , we find that this approach is capable of revealing such subtle features .",
    "not surprisingly , the approach fares better for higher quality of the monte carlo data .",
    "our work provides the first application of the asm for analytical continuation of quantum monte carlo data for off - lattice systems with continuous potentials .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : asm ] we outline the average spectrum method .",

    "the analytic continuation of the intermediate scattering function  @xcite is based on the fourier relation between the dynamic structure factor @xmath3 and the intermediate scattering function @xmath4 : @xmath5 by performing the replacement @xmath6 , and using the detailed balance relation @xmath7 we obtain @xmath8s(q,\\omega),\\label{eq : fqtau1}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is the partition function , the quantum collective density operator is given by @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the number of particles , @xmath14 the wave number , and @xmath15 is the position operator of particle @xmath2 .",
    "the reason for introducing the imaginary time intermediate scattering function , @xmath16 , is that , unlike its real time counterpart , it is straightforward to obtain it using an appropriate path - integral monte carlo ( pimc ) simulation technique.@xcite however , in order to obtain the dynamic structure factor and the real time intermediate scattering function one has to invert the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fqtau1 ] ) . due to the singular nature of the integration kernel the inversion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fqtau1 ] ) is an ill - posed problem . as a consequence ,",
    "a direct approach to the inversion would lead to an uncontrollable amplification of the statistical noise in the data for @xmath16 , resulting in an infinite number of solutions that satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : fqtau1 ] ) .    in the present study",
    "we apply the recently developed averaged spectrum method,@xcite related to earlier stochastic continuation approaches,@xcite to invert the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fqtau1 ] ) to get @xmath3 . following the notation of other analytic continuation methods",
    ", we will refer to @xmath16 as the data ( input data generated from the pimc approach ) , @xmath17 as the singular kernel , and @xmath3 as the solution .",
    "furthermore , in what follows , we will assume that both the imaginary time axis and the frequency axis are discretized such that @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "hence , eq .  ( [ eq : fqtau1 ] ) in its discrete form is given by : @xmath22 where for future reference , the vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 describe the data and the solution in discrete space , with values given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the basic idea behind the asm is to pick the final solution for @xmath24 as the average spectral function obtained by averaging over a posterior distribution : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fqtau - d ] ) for a given input @xmath23 , and the posterior distribution can be expressed using bayes theorem as:@xcite @xmath29 in the above , @xmath30 is the prior probability distribution and @xmath31 is the likelihood function . in the present study",
    "we assume a uniform prior for all positive spectral functions with a zero moment that obeys the sum rule @xmath32 .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath30 as:@xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is dirac s delta function and @xmath35 is the heaviside step function . the choice of the prior distributions can be tricky . in order to avoid any undesired bias in the inversion procedure , we limit the present study to the case of a uniform prior that meets the necessary sum rule described above .",
    "the likelihood function appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : posterior ] ) describing the fluctuations of the imaginary time data is assumed to be of a gaussian form :    @xmath36    where we have partitioned the pimc data into @xmath37 bins each contains @xmath38 measurements , the vector @xmath39 is the average result for bin @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the data vector corresponding to a specific solution @xmath28 .",
    "the width of the gaussian distribution is taken from the covariance matrix @xmath42 with elements of @xmath43 given by : @xmath44 the above expression for the likelihood function can further be simplified  @xcite to derive a working expression give by : @xmath45 with the `` energy '' function @xmath46 given by : @xmath47    for readers who are interested in a more comprehensive discussion of the asm we refer them to refs .   and .",
    "here , we have provided a short overview for completeness and note that the averaging procedure described above ensures that solutions ( @xmath28 ) which over - fit the noise in the data ( @xmath23 ) are averaged out , and thus the outcome is likely to be a smooth spectrum , with realistic features .",
    "the major goal of the present study is to conduct a direct comparison between the asm , the maxent method , and the qmct for collective density fluctuations in liquid _ ortho_-deuterium and liquid _ para_-hydrogen .",
    "both liquids have been studied extensively over the past decade by many different techniques.@xcite these and other studies show that they are characterized by quantum dynamical susceptibilities which are not reproducible using classical theories .",
    "thus , these liquids are ideal to assess the accuracy of methods developed for quantum liquids and serve as canonical models in the field .",
    "the static input required by the qmct and the imaginary time intermediate scattering function required for the analytic continuation approaches were generated by pimc simulations at @xmath48 and @xmath49 for liquid _",
    "ortho_-deuterium  @xcite and @xmath50 and @xmath51 for liquid _ para_-hydrogen.@xcite the pimc simulations were done using the nvt ensemble with @xmath52 particles interacting via the silvera - goldman potential,@xcite where the entire molecule is described as a spherical particle , so the potential depends only on the radial distance between particles .",
    "the staging algorithm  @xcite for monte carlo chain moves was employed to compute the numerically exact input .",

    "[ fig : sqw ] we show the results for the dynamic structure factor @xmath3 for both liquids and for different values of @xmath62 .",

    "et al._@xcite for liquid _",
    "para_-hydrogen for selected values of @xmath62 ( the theoretical values of @xmath62 are slightly different from the experiments due to the limitations associated with the constant volume simulation and finite size effects ) .",
    "several important features are observed experimentally : first , the present of a finite frequency peak that disappears around @xmath63 signifying the presence of collective density fluctuations ( this feature is not observed classically for these systems ) .",
    "second , the presence of a low frequency peak associated with the long - time relaxation of density fluctuations . finally , as @xmath62 approaches @xmath64 ( @xmath65 is the value of @xmath62 where the static structure factor reaches its first maximum ) one observes a quantum mechanical de gennes narrowing of the dynamic structure factor .",
    "these features are semi - quantitatively reproduced by the qmct as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sqw ] ( a full description of the method can be found in our previous publication  @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", the theory captures the position of both the low and high intensity peaks for liquid _ ortho_-deuterium and slightly overestimates the position of the high frequency peak for liquid _ para_-hydrogen .",
    "the width of the peaks , which are associated with the lifetime of density relaxation , are also captured by qmct as is the quantum mechanical de gennes narrowing of the dynamic structure factor .",
    "the overall good agreement between the qmct and the experiments is remarkable and signifies the importance of the quantum mode - coupling portion to the memory kernel at long times.@xcite    turning to the maxent results for @xmath3 ( a full description of the calculation can be found elsewhere  ) , it becomes obvious that maxent fails to provide a quantitative description of the density fluctuations in these liquids .",
    "it is well known that the maxent approach often fails when several distinct spectral features appear that are closely spaced in frequency .",
    "this is clearly the case here where the maxent approach predicts a single frequency peak instead of two , at a position that is approximately the averaged position of the two experimental peaks . only when the dynamics are characterized by a single relaxation time , like the case at @xmath66 , does the maxent approach provides quantitative results .",
    "the failure of the maxent result poses a challenge for analytic continuation based methods .",
    "can the inversion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fqtau1 ] ) by other analytic continuation methods produce features that are not reproducible by maxent ? in order to address this problem , we need to average the spectrum over the posterior distribution , e.g , solve for the average spectrum as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sqwav ] ) .",
    "the averaging procedure is best done by a metropolis monte carlo approach described in ref .  .",
    "the basic idea behind the monte carlo procedure is to start with any guess for the spectrum @xmath24 and then preform a metropolis walk in the solution space to obtain different spectra @xmath28 that are distributed according to posterior distribution @xmath67 .        in practice , we follow the recipe of ref .  .",
    "first , we randomly choose a pair of neighboring frequencies , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",

    "( [ eq : energy ] ) . in the present study",
    "we employ a simple metropolis algorithm to sample the values of @xmath28 .",
    "we did not encounter difficulties with sampling that require more sophisticated monte carlo procedures like parallel - tempering.@xcite as a check , we started the monte carlo procedure from @xmath58 different initial conditions .",
    "all the different runs converged to the same solution within the statistical noise of the monte carlo sampling . the asm results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sqw ] where averaged over @xmath75 monte carlo sweeps , each consist of an attempt to change @xmath76 solution points .",
    "the main and perhaps , unexpected , result is that the asm captures qualitatively all feature observed experimentally for the dynamics structure factor , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sqw ] .",
    "contrary to maxent , the asm reproduces the low and finite frequency peaks , albeit the fact that it somewhat underestimates the width of the finite frequency peak and also slightly overestimates the position of the low frequency peak .",
    "overall , the asm agrees better with the qmct and with the experimental results as compared to maxent .",
    "the fact that there are features that are observed experimentally and captured by qmct and asm and not by maxent method , indicate the superiority of the former approaches over maxent .    despite the semi - quantitative agreement of the qmct and asm",
    "approaches with experiments , there are still significant differences , as clearly is the case for liquid _ para_-hydrogen .",
    "it still remains a challenge to determine the accuracy of both approaches since an exact solution for this many - body quantum mechanical problem is still ( and may always be ) out of reach .",
    "a direct comparison with experiments can be misleading , since several approximations are made for both qmct and asm .",
    "first , both are based on the assumption that the dynamics evolve over the potential energy taken from the work of silvera and goldman.@xcite furthermore , for simplicity , _ para_-hydrogen and _ ortho_-deuterium were treated as spherical particles , while experimentally this is not the case .",
    "finally , for convenience , the simulations were done for the nvt ensemble while experiments are conducted at constant pressure ( npt ensemble ) .",
    "these approximation may lead to the difference observed between the theory and experiments , but the differences may also be attributed to the approximations made by qmct and asm for the dynamics itself .",
    "nonetheless , the encouraging agreement between qmct and asm provides stronger support for their accuracy .    before we conclude , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fqtau ] we show the excellent agreement between the imaginary data generated by the pimc simulations and imaginary data obtained by the inversion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fqtau1 ] ) .",
    "as is well understood , only disagreement at this level can be used to draw decisive conclusion about the inversion process .",
    "however , it is quite satisfactory that the monte carlo procedure in the asm leads to an excellent agreement for the imaginary time data .",
    "a comparison between the qmct , maxent method , and asm has been made for the case of collective density fluctuations in liquid _ ortho_-deuterium and liquid _ para_-hydrogen .",
    "as far as we know , the present study is the first attempt to apply the asm to dynamical susceptibilities for off - lattice models .",
    "we find that the main features observed experimentally for the cases discussed above are captured by qmct and asm , but not by maxent .",
    "the results obtained by the asm appear to coincide with the experimental results more closely in the case of _ ortho_-deuterium . in this case",
    "the asm produces results that are narrower than those seen in experiment .",
    "however , it should be expected that the theoretical spectrum is indeed sharper than that obtained in experiment because no instrumental broadening function is included in the theoretical calculations . the better agreement in the case of _",
    "ortho_-deuterium compared to _",
    "para_-hydrogen for the asm may be a result of the better statistical quality of the data used in the _",
    "ortho_-deuterium case .",
    "our asm results for the non - trivial examples presented here give strong motivation to continue the investigation of the asm approach in other systems .",
    "one important problem worthy of reinvestigation is study of density fluctuations in superfluid helium .",
    "boninsegni and ceperley  @xcite studied this problem and found that the sharp features associated with roton peaks could not be reproduced by the maxent approach .",
    "it would be interesting to see what the asm yields for this challenging and important problem .",
    "indeed , since the the asm results presented here and by others provide clear evidence that analytic continuation based approaches are not limited to the case where dynamical susceptibilities are characterized by a single timescale , and since the asm is a flexible approach suitable to the study of any type of correlation function for which imaginary time quantum monte carlo data can be generated , we expect that this approach will be further developed and utilized as a powerful means of extracting dynamical information from imaginary time simulations .",
    "we would also like to add a word that at this stage it is still not entirely clear what should be trusted _ a priori _ in the asm results and if the asm is universally superior to maxent .",
    "unpublished work investigating the behavior of both maxent and the asm in lattice models of the temperature and doping dependence near the mott transition actually suggest that maxent can in some cases provide a superior description of certain spectral features , but is inferior in its description of others.@xcite for example maxent fails completely in describing the fermi liquid behavior of the self energy in the low frequency range while , rather surprisingly , the asm does .",
    "thus , we may conservatively suggest that at the very least , the asm provides a complimentary and useful tool for extracting real time features from imaginary time quantum monte carlo data that appears to be superior to maxent at least in its ability to uncover sharp spectral features .",
    "assessing the accuracy of the asm in a more systematic manner is another worthy direction of future research .",
