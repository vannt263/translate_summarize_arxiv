    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are intense flashes of @xmath1-rays which occur approximately once per day and are isotropically distributed over the sky  ( see , e.g. : * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the variability of the bursts on time scales as short as a millisecond indicates that the sources are very compact , while the identification of host galaxies and the measurement of redshifts for more than 100 bursts have shown that grbs are of extra - galactic origin .",
    "grbs are grouped into two broad classes by their characteristic duration and spectral hardness  @xcite .",
    "the progenitors of most short grbs ( @xmath2 2 s , with hard spectra ) are widely thought to be mergers of neutron star binaries or neutron star - black hole binaries ; see for example @xcite . a small fraction ( up to @xmath315% ) of short - duration grbs",
    "are also thought to be due to giant flares from a local distribution of soft - gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) @xcite .",
    "long grbs ( @xmath4 2 s , with soft spectra ) , on the other hand , are associated with core - collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "both the merger and supernova scenarios result in the formation of a stellar - mass black hole with accretion disk @xcite , and the emission of gravitational radiation is expected in this process .    to date",
    ", several searches for gravitational - wave bursts ( gwbs ) associated with gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have been performed using data from ligo or virgo .",
    "data from the second ligo science run were used to search for a gravitational - wave signal from grb  030329/sn  2003dh @xcite , a bright grb and associated supernova located at a redshift of @xmath5 .",
    "this was followed by a search for gwbs coincident with 39 grbs which were detected during the second , third , and fourth ligo science runs @xcite .",
    "data from the virgo detector were used to search for a gwb associated with grb 050915a @xcite .",
    "most recently , data from the fifth ligo science run was analyzed to search for a gwb or binary coalescence inspiral signal from grb  070201 @xcite .",
    "this short - duration grb had a position error box overlapping the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) , located at a distance of 770 kpc .",
    "no evidence for a gravitational - wave signal was found in these searches . in the case of grb  070201 ,",
    "the non - detection of associated gravitational waves provided important information about its progenitor , ruling out a compact - object binary in m31 with high confidence .    in this paper , we present the results of a search for gravitational - wave bursts associated with 137 grbs that were detected by satellite - based gamma - ray experiments during the fifth ligo science run ( s5 ) and first virgo science run ( vsr1 ) , which collectively spanned the period from 2005",
    "november 4 to 2007 october 1 .",
    "this is the first joint search for gravitational waves by ligo and virgo ; it also uses improved methods compared to previous searches , and is thus able to achieve better sensitivity .",
    "we search for gwbs from both short- and long - duration grbs .",
    "since the precise nature of the radiation depends on the somewhat - unknown progenitor model , and we analyse both short and long grbs , the search methods presented in this paper do not require specific knowledge of the gravitational waveforms .",
    "instead , we look for unmodelled burst signals with duration @xmath6 s and frequencies in the ligo / virgo band , approximately 60 hz @xmath7 2000 hz . the results of a template - based search specifically targeting binary inspiral gravitational - wave signals associated with short grbs are presented separately @xcite .",
    "although it is expected that most grb progenitors will be at distances too large for the resulting gravitational - wave signals to be detectable by ligo and virgo @xcite , it is possible that a few grbs could be located nearby .",
    "for example , the smallest observed redshift of an optical grb afterglow is @xmath8 ( @xmath9mpc ) , for grb 980425 @xcite ; this would be within the ligo - virgo detectable range for some progenitor models .",
    "recent studies @xcite indicate the existence of a local population of under - luminous long grbs with an observed rate density ( number per unit volume per unit time ) approximately @xmath10 times that of the high - luminosity population . also , observations seem to suggest that short - duration grbs tend to have smaller redshifts than long grbs @xcite , and this has led to fairly optimistic estimates @xcite for detecting associated gravitational - wave emission in an extended ligo science run .",
    "approximately 70% of the grbs in our sample do not have measured redshifts , so it is possible that one or more could be much closer than the typical gpc distance of grbs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] with some comments on the astrophysical significance of these results and the prospects for future grb searches .",
    "the ligo detectors are kilometer - scale power - recycled michelson interferometers with orthogonal fabry - perot arms @xcite .",
    "they are designed to detect gravitational waves with frequencies ranging from @xmath11  hz to several khz .",
    "the interferometers maximum sensitivity occurs near 150  hz . there are two ligo observatories : one located at hanford , wa and the other at livingston , la .",
    "the hanford site houses two interferometers : one with 4 km arms ( h1 ) , and the other with 2 km arms ( h2 ) .",
    "the livingston observatory has one 4 km interferometer ( l1 ) .",
    "the observatories are separated by a distance of 3000  km , corresponding to a time - of - flight separation of 10  ms .",
    "the virgo detector ( v1 ) is in cascina near pisa , italy .",
    "it is a 3 km long power - recycled michelson interferometer with orthogonal fabry - perot arms @xcite . during vsr1 ,",
    "the virgo detector had sensitivity similar to the ligo 4 km interferometers above approximately 500 hz . the time - of - flight separation between the virgo and hanford observatories is 27 ms , and between virgo and livingston it is 25 ms .",
    "a gravitational wave is a spacetime metric perturbation that is manifested as a time - varying quadrupolar strain , with two polarization components .",
    "data from each interferometer record the length difference of the arms and , when calibrated , measure the strain induced by a gravitational wave .",
    "these data are in the form of a time series , digitized at a sample rate of 16384 s@xmath12 ( ligo ) or 20000 s@xmath12 ( virgo ) .",
    "the response of an interferometer to a given strain is measured by injecting sinusoidal excitations with known amplitude into the test mass control systems and tracking the resulting signals at the measurement point throughout each run .",
    "the result is a measurement of the time - varying , frequency - dependent response function of each interferometer .    the fifth ligo science run ( s5 )",
    "was held from 2005 november 4 to 2007 october 1 . during this run , over one year of science - quality data was collected with all three ligo interferometers in simultaneous operation .",
    "the ligo interferometers operated at their design sensitivity , with duty factors of 75% , 76% , and 65% for the h1 , h2 , and l1 interferometers .",
    "the virgo detector started its first science run ( vsr1 ) on 2007 may 18 .",
    "the virgo duty cycle over vsr1 was 78% .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows the best sensitivities , in terms of noise spectral density , of the ligo and virgo interferometers during the run .",
    "all of the instruments ran together continuously until 2007 october 1 , amounting to about 4.5 months of joint data taking .",
    "best strain noise spectra from the ligo and virgo detectors during s5-vsr1.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the geo  600 detector @xcite , located near hannover , germany , was also operational during the s5-vsr1 run , though with a lower sensitivity than ligo and virgo .",
    "we do not use the geo data in this search as the modest gains in the sensitivity to gravitational wave signals would not have offset the increased complexity of the analysis .",
    "the grb triggers that were contemporaneous with the s5-vsr1 run came mostly from the _ swift _ satellite @xcite , but several triggers also came from other ipn satellites @xcite , including hete-2 @xcite , and integral @xcite .",
    "we obtained our grb triggers through the gamma - ray burst coordinates network @xcite . during the s5-vsr1 run",
    ", there were a total of 212 grbs reported by these satellite - based gamma - ray experiments .",
    "of these , 33 were short - duration grbs , and 59 had associated redshift measurements .",
    "all but 4 of these grbs had well - defined positions .    only ligo and virgo data which are of science - mode quality are analyzed .",
    "these are data collected when the interferometers are in a stable , resonant configuration .",
    "additionally , data segments which are flagged as being of poor quality are not included in the analysis .",
    "a full analysis ( detection search and upper limit calculation ) is performed for all grbs which have well - defined positions and for which at least two interferometers have science - mode data passing quality requirements .",
    "there are 137 such grbs , of which 21 are short - duration bursts , and 35 have measured redshifts . a list of the grbs and relevant information are given in table  [ tab : combined ] in appendix  [ sec : grbs ] .",
    "the basic search procedure follows that used in recent ligo grb searches @xcite .",
    "all grbs are treated identically , without regard to their duration , redshift ( if known ) , or fluence .",
    "we use the interval from 120 s before each grb trigger time to 60 s after as the window in which to search for an associated gravitational - wave burst .",
    "this conservative window is large enough to take into account most reasonable time delays between a gravitational - wave signal from a progenitor and the onset of the gamma - ray signal .",
    "for example , it is much larger than the @xmath13 s delay of the gamma - ray signal resulting from the sub - luminal propagation of the jet to the surface of the star in the collapsar model for long grbs ( see for example * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is also much longer than the @xmath14 s delay which may occur in the binary neutron star merger scenario for short grbs if a hypermassive neutron star is formed ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our window is also safely larger than any uncertainty in the definition of the measured grb trigger time .",
    "the data in this search window are called the _ on - source _ data .",
    "the on - source data are scanned by an algorithm designed to detect transients that may have been caused by a gravitational - wave burst . in this search ,",
    "two algorithms are used : the cross - correlation algorithm used in previous ligo searches @xcite , and , a new coherent analysis package @xcite .",
    "the cross - correlation algorithm correlates the data between pairs of detectors , while  combines data from arbitrary sets of detectors , taking into account the antenna response and noise level of each detector to improve the search sensitivity .",
    "the data are analysed independently by  and the cross - correlation algorithm to produce lists of transients , or _",
    "events _ , that may be candidate gravitational - wave signals",
    ". each event is characterised by a measure of significance , based on energy ( ) or correlation between detectors ( cross - correlation algorithm ) . to reduce the effect of non - stationary background noise , the list of candidate events",
    "is subjected to checks that `` veto '' events overlapping in time with known instrumental or environmental disturbances @xcite",
    ".  also applies additional consistency tests based on the correlations between the detectors to further reduce the number of background events .",
    "the surviving event with the largest significance is taken to be the best candidate for a gravitational - wave signal for that grb ; it is referred to as the _ loudest event _ @xcite .    to estimate the expected distribution of the loudest events under the null hypothesis ,",
    "the pipelines are also applied to all coincident data within a 3 h period surrounding the on - source data .",
    "this data for background estimation is called the _ off - source _ data .",
    "its proximity to the on - source data makes it likely that the estimated background will properly reflect the noise properties in the on - source segment .",
    "the off - source data are processed identically to the on - source data ; in particular , the same data - quality cuts and consistency tests are applied , and the same sky position relative to the earth is used . to increase the off - source distribution statistics ,",
    "multiple time shifts are applied to the data streams from different detector sites ( or between the h1 and h2 streams for grbs occurring when only those two detectors were operating ) , and the off - source data are re - analysed for each time shift . for each 180 s segment of off - source data ,",
    "the loudest surviving event is determined .",
    "the distribution of significances of the loudest background events , @xmath15 , thus gives us an empirical measure of the expected distribution of the significance of the loudest on - source event @xmath16 under the null hypothesis .    to determine",
    "if a gwb is present in the on - source data , the loudest on - source event is compared to the background distribution .",
    "if the on - source significance is larger than that of the loudest event in 95% of the off - source segments ( i.e. , if @xmath17 ) , then the event is considered as a candidate gravitational - wave signal .",
    "candidate signals are subjected to additional `` detection checklist '' studies to try to determine the physical origin of the event ; these studies may lead to rejecting the event as being of terrestrial origin , or they may increase our degree of confidence in it being due to a gravitational wave .    regardless of whether a statistically significant signal is present , we also set a frequentist upper limit on the strength of gravitational waves associated with the grb . for a given gravitational - wave signal model ,",
    "we define the 90% confidence level upper limit on the signal amplitude as the minimum amplitude for which there is a 90% or greater chance that such a signal , if present in the on - source region , would have produced an event with significance larger than the largest value @xmath16 actually measured .",
    "the signal models simulated are discussed in sec .  [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "since  was found to be more sensitive to gwbs than the cross - correlation pipeline ( by about a factor of 2 in amplitude ) , we decided in advance to set the upper limits using the  results .",
    "the cross - correlation pipeline is used as a detection - only search . since it was used previously for the analysis of a large number of grbs during s2-s4 , and for grb070201 during s5 , including the cross - correlation pipeline provides continuity with past grb searches and allows comparison of  with the technique used for these past searches .",
    "is a -based software package for performing coherent searches for gravitational - wave bursts in data from arbitrary networks of detectors .",

    "we therefore give only a brief summary of the pipeline here .    in the present search ,",
    "the cross - correlation pipeline is applied to the ligo detectors only .",
    "( the different orientation and noise spectrum shape of virgo relative to the ligo detectors is more easily accounted for in a coherent analysis . )",

    "the sky position is perturbed in a random direction by a gaussian - distributed angle with standard deviation of 3 arcmin .",
    "finally , the discrete amplitudes used are offset by those in the standard analysis by a half - step in amplitude .",
    "the perturbed injections are then processed , and the open - box upper limit produced using the same coherent consistency test tuning as in the actual open - box search .",
    "the typical difference between the upper limits for perturbed injections and unperturbed injections then gives an estimate of the impact of the errors on our upper limits .    for low - frequency injections ( at 150 hz ) we find that the ratio of the upper limit for perturbed injections to unperturbed injections is 1.03 with a standard deviation of 0.06 .",

    "<S> we present the results of a search for gravitational - wave bursts associated with 137 gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) that were detected by satellite - based gamma - ray experiments during the fifth ligo science run and first virgo science run . </S>",
    "<S> the data used in this analysis were collected from 2005 november 4 to 2007 october 1 , and most of the grb triggers were from the _ swift _ satellite . </S>",
    "<S> the search uses a coherent network analysis method that takes into account the different locations and orientations of the interferometers at the three ligo - virgo sites . </S>",
    "<S> we find no evidence for gravitational - wave burst signals associated with this sample of grbs . </S>",
    "<S> using simulated short - duration ( @xmath0 s ) waveforms , we set upper limits on the amplitude of gravitational waves associated with each grb . we also place lower bounds on the distance to each grb under the assumption of a fixed energy emission in gravitational waves , with a median limit of for emission at frequencies around 150 hz , where the ligo - virgo detector network has best sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> we present astrophysical interpretations and implications of these results , and prospects for corresponding searches during future ligo - virgo runs . </S>"
