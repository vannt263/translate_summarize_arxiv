    "evolving interfaces or surfaces are of great interest due to their potential technological applications .",
    "these interfaces can be found in many physical , chemical and biological processes .",
    "examples include film growth either by vapour deposition or chemical deposition @xcite , bacterial colony growth @xcite and propagation of forest fire @xcite .    for a system exhibiting dynamical scaling , the r.m.s .",
    "roughness @xmath5 of an interface is characterized by the following scaling with respect to time @xmath6 and the lateral system width @xmath7 : @xmath8 where the scaling function @xmath9 behaves as @xmath10 with @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 constant for @xmath14 .",
    "the exponent @xmath15 is the roughness exponent that describes the dependence of the saturated surface roughness versus the lateral system size , while the exponent @xmath16 describes scaling at an early stage when finite - size effects are negligible .",
    "the crossover time between the two regimes is @xmath17 .",
    "a widely studied phenomenological equation representing the non - equilibrium growth of such interfaces is the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation . in @xmath18 dimensions ,",
    "it states that : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the local surface height at lateral coordinate @xmath21 and time @xmath6 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the strength of the linear and nonlinear surface smoothing terms respectively .",
    "the noise @xmath24 is gaussian with zero variance and covariance @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the strength of the noise .",
    "the exponents characterizing the kpz equation in the highly nonlinear strong coupling are @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath29 the linear edward wilkinson ( ew ) equation is recovered leading to the weak coupling exponents @xmath30 and @xmath31 . when both @xmath22 and @xmath23 are zero the growth reduces to simple random deposition ( rd ) with @xmath32 but a lack of any saturation regime .",
    "there has been a recent interest in the study of competitive growth models ( cgm ) analyzing the interplay and competition between two current growth processes for a single surface .",
    "these cgm are often more realistic in describing growing in real materials @xcite , in which more than one microscopic growth mode usually exist .",
    "for example , two distinct growth phases were observed in experiments on interfacial roughening in hele - shaw flows @xcite as well as in simulations on electrophoretic deposition of polymer chains @xcite .",
    "the resulting universalities from these competing processes are not well understood @xcite . recently",
    "horowitz et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a cgm called bd / rd in which the microscopic growth rule follows either that of the ballistic deposition ( bd ) model with probability @xmath0 or simple random deposition ( rd ) with probability @xmath1 .",
    "this system exhibits a transition at a characteristic time from rd to kpz .",
    "they found numerically that the scaling behavior of @xmath5 in that model is giving by the empirical form @xmath33 based on numerical estimates , exact values @xmath34 have been conjectured for the bd / rd model .",
    "based on this conjecture , the authors concluded using scaling arguments that the model follows eq .",
    "( [ eq.kpz ] ) with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "subsequently , a similar cgm namely ew / rd describing the competition between the ew model and rd @xcite .",
    "the simulations showed that eq .",
    "( [ eq.scalew ] ) also holds with a different set of exponents which are conjectured to be @xmath37 this model can also be described by eq .",
    "( [ eq.kpz ] ) with @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite . in this paper , we explain the scaling form ( [ eq.scalew ] ) and derive rigorously the exact exponents @xmath40 and @xmath41 using simple arguments .",
    "in addition , from the above examples of cgm , one might be tempted to conclude that a cgm based on rd and a model in the kpz ( ew ) universality class should always lead to an overall process in the kpz ( ew ) class .",
    "we suggest that these naive predictions of the universality is not always correct .",
    "close examination of the microscopic details of the growth models is indeed essentially .",
    "this is illustrated by introducing a constrained ew ( cew ) model .",
    "although this model essentially belongs to the ew class , a cgm in the form cew / rd at sufficiently small @xmath0 results in an overall process in the kpz universality class .",
    "it also demonstrates that a cgm can crossover from one universality class to another by varying @xmath0 .",
    "in the rd model a particle is dropped at a randomly selected column increasing the local surface height by one . for the cgms bd / rd or ew / rd described above",
    ", a particle is deposited on the surface following a rd process with probability @xmath1 and by another process @xmath42 ( which is either bd or ew ) with probability @xmath0 .",
    "now , we derived analytically the exact exponents @xmath40 and @xmath41 which characterize the @xmath0 dependence of the scaling behavior of @xmath5 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq.scalew ] ) .",
    "we consider @xmath43 . at each unit time , @xmath7 particles are deposited .",
    "the average time interval between any two consecutive @xmath42 events at any column @xmath44 is @xmath45 . during this period ,",
    "@xmath46 atoms on average are directly stacked onto the surface according to the simple rd rule .",
    "the local height at column @xmath44 hence increases by @xmath47 which is an independent gaussian variable with mean @xmath48 and standard deviation @xmath49 according to the central limit theorem .",
    "the mean however only leads to an irrelevant rigid shift of the whole surface .",
    "we can easily apply a vertical translation so that @xmath50 .",
    "after these @xmath51 rd events at column @xmath44 , one @xmath42 event on average is expected at the same column .",
    "now we consider @xmath42 to be the bd process .",
    "the cgm is then the bd / rd model .",
    "when a bd event occurs at column @xmath44 , its height is updated in the simulations according to @xmath52 . in the limit @xmath53 so that @xmath54 , the height of the atom is negligible compared with the increments due to the rd events .",
    "the growth rule hence reduces to @xmath55 we have now arrived at a limiting bd / rd model defined as follow : at every coarsened time step @xmath56 , the local height @xmath57 at every column @xmath44 first changes by an additive gaussian noise term @xmath47 with mean zero and standard deviation @xmath58 . then the limiting bd growth rule in eq .",
    "( [ eq.bdlimit ] ) is applied to every column @xmath44 .",
    "a more careful analysis should account for the fact that the bd events at various columns indeed occur randomly and asynchronously during the period @xmath51 but this will not affect our result . in this limiting model , the time and the vertical length scales are determined completely by @xmath51 and @xmath59 respectively .",
    "therefore , time scales as @xmath60 while roughness scales as @xmath61 .",
    "this explains the @xmath0 dependence of the scaling form in eq .",
    "( [ eq.scalew ] ) .",
    "in particular , we obtain the exact exponents @xmath62 and @xmath63 in agreement with values in eq .",
    "( [ eq.dy1 ] ) first conjectured in ref . @xcite but _ not _ derived analytically before .",
    "next , we assume that @xmath42 represents the ew growth rule instead . for this growth rule ,",
    "a particle is dropped at a random column but when it reaches the surface it is allowed to relax to the lower of the nearest neighboring columns .",
    "if the heights at both nearest neighbors are lower than the selected one the relaxation is directed to either of them with equal probability .",
    "our cgm now becomes a ew / rd model .",
    "the corresponding derivation of the characteristic length and time scales is similar to that for the bd / rd case .",
    "assuming again @xmath64 , the average time interval between any two consecutive ew events at any given site is @xmath45 .",
    "consider a characteristic time @xmath65 . on average @xmath65 rd events",
    "occur at any given site leading height increments with a standard deviation @xmath66 . however , only @xmath67 ew events take place .",
    "the resulting smoothing dynamics is such that a big step for instance will typically decrease in height by @xmath67 . for scaling to hold ,",
    "the two length scales @xmath66 and @xmath67 have to be identical and we obtain @xmath68 .",
    "the characteristic time scale considered is hence @xmath69 , while a characteristic length scale for the surface height is @xmath70 .",
    "we have hence derived @xmath71 and @xmath72 previously conjectured in ref .",
    "we now introduce the constrained ew model ( cew ) which is a generalization of the ew model . in @xmath18 dimensions",
    ", particles are aggregated by the following rules .",
    "we choose a site @xmath44 at random among the @xmath7 possible sites .",
    "the surface height @xmath57 at the selected column is increased by one if this height is lower than the values @xmath73 at the neighboring columns . otherwise either @xmath74 or @xmath75 , whichever smaller , is increased to @xmath76 if @xmath77 , either one will be updated with equal probability .",
    "growth at @xmath78 physically represents the rollover of a newly dropped particle to a lower site nearby under the influence of gravity for example . in the original ew model",
    ", there is no limit in the vertical distance transversed during the rollover and the particle can in principle slides down a very deep cliff if one exists next to column @xmath44 .",
    "this is unphysical if there is a finite chance for the sideway sticking of the particle to the cliff . in the cew growth rule defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq.cew ] ) , this vertical drop during rollover is limited to @xmath79 by the process of sideway sticking . as @xmath80 , it is easy to see that cew reduces to the standard ew model . at @xmath81 ,",
    "sideway sticking of particles occurs frequently and cew behaves similarly to bd , although the precise growth rules are different . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we put @xmath82 .",
    "as will be demonstrated by the simulations presented later , the cew model at @xmath82 at practical length and time scales belongs to the ew universality class .",
    "finally , we can define the cew / rd model which is a cgm based on rd and cew .",
    "similar to the definitions of other cgm defined above , at each simulation step , the cew growth rule is applied with probability @xmath0 while a rd event occurs with probability @xmath1 .",
    "time @xmath6 is then increased by @xmath83 .",
    "now we present the simulation results . in fig .",
    "[ f.1](a ) and fig .",
    "[ f.1](b ) we show the log - log plot of @xmath84 as function of @xmath85 for two limiting values of @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath3 the behavior is consistent with the kpz universality class with @xmath27 and @xmath86 , while for @xmath4 the system behaves as predicted by the ew equation with @xmath27 and @xmath87 .",
    "the initial regime corresponding to the rd deposition , with @xmath32 does not scale with the system size . in order to show that the universality class depends on @xmath0",
    ", we compute @xmath16 as function of @xmath6 using successive slopes defined in ref  @xcite .    figure  [ f.2 ] plots @xmath16 as a function of @xmath88 for different values of @xmath0 . at the beginning",
    "@xmath89 as expected for the initial rd regime . after this early regime , the system evolves either to the kpz class with @xmath28 for @xmath3 or to the ew class for @xmath4 with @xmath31 . for intermediate @xmath0 values",
    "( after the rd regime ) , the system behaves as in the weak coupling of eq .",
    "( [ eq.kpz ] ) .",
    "it is easy to observe a transition from an ew to a kpz for @xmath90 while for @xmath3 the system always belongs to the kpz universality class .",
    "as we show above the cew / rd model has a transition from a kpz to a ew as the tuning parameter @xmath0 goes from @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "thus the nonlinear coefficient @xmath23 of the kpz equation has to vanish as @xmath4 . in order to understand the functional form of @xmath93 we perform a finite size scaling analysis of the growth velocity based on @xcite : @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the @xmath97 correction should go to zero when the nonlinear term @xmath23 vanishes .",
    "thus , using eq .",
    "( [ eq.dv ] ) we can determine how @xmath23 in the kpz equation depends on @xmath0 .",
    "in fig  .[f.lambda ] we plot @xmath98 as function of @xmath0 for fixed @xmath7 to show the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath23 . from the plot",
    "we can see that the functional form for the cew / rd cgm is totally different from the scaling form @xmath99 of the bd / rd model @xcite . for small @xmath0 values",
    "@xmath23 has a power law dependence with @xmath0 , while for @xmath4 , @xmath100 with a fast decay .",
    "now we proceed to generalize eq .",
    "( [ eq.kpz ] ) for the cgm model applying the following transformation : @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 . where @xmath104 is the length transformation .",
    "as the interface evolution of these cgm are independent of @xmath104 they can be described , after applying the transformations defined above , by the generalized continuous equation : @xmath105 with @xmath106 where @xmath107 is related to the characteristic time scale when the correlations begins to dominate the dynamic of the interface and @xmath108 is related to the saturation length scale .",
