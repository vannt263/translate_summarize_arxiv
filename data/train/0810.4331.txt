    "<S> it is often argued that entanglement is at the root of the speedup for quantum compared to classical computation , and that one needs a sufficient amount of entanglement for this speedup to be manifest . in measurement - based quantum computing ( mbqc ) , the need for a highly entangled initial state is particularly obvious . defying this intuition , </S>",

    "<S> @xcite can efficiently simulate any quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> the best - known classical algorithm for this task requires super - polynomial run time and it is strongly believed that no substantial improvement is possible . </S>",
    "<S> it is in this sense that certain many - body states possess strong computational power . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the particular states mentioned above are _ computaionally universal _ in that they enable a classical machine to effeciently solve any problem in the complexity class bqp @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the key question that we ask in this work is : _ how common is the property of offering universal computational speed - ups and what is the role of entanglement in this context ? _    </S>",
    "<S> all previous results which rule out computational universality of certain quantum systems seem to do so by either ( i ) showing that the systems are _ not entangled enough _ to support a universal quantum calculation @xcite or ( ii ) relying on stringent symmetries @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore reasonable to conjecture , by extrapolating from the current lines of research , that in generic situations `` more entanglement '' will imply `` more computational power '' .    </S>",
    "<S> going further , it has been realized ( using sundry techniques known under the label of the `` probabilistic method '' or the `` concentration of measure phenomenon '' @xcite ) , that generic quantum states are extremely highly entangled from many points of view @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a typical state is almost maximally entangled with respect to any partition of its systems into two parties . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that most states are excellent resources for some quantum information protocols , e.g.  teleportation with respect to _ any _ bipartition . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is plausible to suspect that offering a computational speed - up is a generic feature of quantum states , if only advanced enough classical control schemes could be devised to utilize their power .    _ </S>",
    "<S> main result . </S>",
    "<S>  _ the arguments presented above turn out to be fallacies . in a first step </S>",
    "<S> , we will show that families of states with a large amount of entanglement  as quantified by the _ </S>",
    "<S> geometric measure _ of entanglement @xcite  can not be universal . recall that the geometric measure of a state vector @xmath2 is defined as @xmath3 where the supremum is taken over the set of all product states , @xmath4 . in a second step , </S>",
    "<S> we proceed to demonstrate that our criterion for large entanglement is fulfilled by typical quantum states with overwhelming probability : they are too entangled to be useful in this sense .    </S>",
    "<S> the proof involves substituting the quantum resource by a fair coin . in that sense , we show that even if one has complete knowledge about the state used and is capable of designing the most sophisticated measurement scheme , the distribution of the measurement outcomes is not sufficiently different from that of a random string to afford a universal speedup . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is the basis for the related results made independently in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the strategy of proof in the first step is as follows : we assume that a classical computer assisted by local measurements on a highly entangled state can efficiently identify both the solution to a problem f in np @xcite , and a certificate for the solution . under this assumption </S>",
    "<S> , we construct a purely classical algorithm accomplishing the same task . </S>",
    "<S> hence highly entangled states can not cause a significant speed - up for these particular problems . </S>",
    "<S> for concreteness , one may think of f as the paradigmatic factoring problem : given an integer @xmath5 and an interval @xmath6 $ ] , decide whether @xmath5 has a factor contained in @xmath6 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> a certificate for the solution is provided by the prime decomposition of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> since there is an efficient quantum algorithm identifying the prime decomposition @xcite , it follows that highly entangled states can not be universal ( unless factoring is in p , which is generally believed to be highly unlikely ) .    </S>",
    "<S> [ thm : useless ] let @xmath7 be an @xmath0 qubit state with geometric measure of entanglement @xmath8 . consider a classical computer augmented by the power to perform local measurements on @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> assume this joint system is capable of finding and certifying a solution to an np problem f after @xmath9 time steps , with probability of success at least @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> then there exists a _ </S>",
    "<S> purely classical _ algorithm which identifies a solution to f after @xmath11 time steps with probability of success at least @xmath12 . here , @xmath13 is the time it takes to verify the certificate on a classical computer .    </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath14 is a polynomial function of @xmath0 ( this being the defining property of np problems ) . </S>",
    "<S> the theorem implies that a family of states @xmath7 can not provide a super - polynomial speedup whenever their geometric measure is of the form @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> a priori it is unclear that states with such an extreme geometric entanglement exist at all . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that not only do they exist , but that this property is shared by the vast majority of all many - body states .    </S>",
    "<S> [ thm : almost ] the fraction of state vectors on @xmath16 qubits with geometric measure of entanglement less than @xmath17 is smaller than @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> it immediately follows that the fraction of universal resources among @xmath0 qubit pure states is less than @xmath18 .    to prove theorem 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that the classical part of the algorithm is deterministic , which does not restrict generality , since any probabilistic parts may be implemented by using quantum measurements as coins . </S>",
    "<S> in the course of the calculation , the computer will perform up to @xmath0 local single - qubit projective measurements with two outcomes each , obtaining one of @xmath19 possible sequences of outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> there is a set @xmath20 of `` good '' outcomes , which will cause the computer to output a valid solution to the problem f after @xmath21 time steps . by assumption , </S>",
    "<S> the probability of obtaining an outcome from @xmath20 is larger than @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> each element of @xmath20 is labeled by a product state @xmath22 corresponding to the local measurement outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of the event associated with @xmath22 to occur is @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath24 thus the ratio of good outcomes to the total number obeys @xmath25    to simulate the procedure on a classical computer , use the following algorithm : instead of performing a physical measurement , choose the outcome of the measurements randomly using a fair coin , to generate a random string . </S>",
    "<S> this string is fed into the same classical postprocessing algorithm as before . </S>",
    "<S> if the random string causes the classical part of the computation to output a result after @xmath9 time steps , check whether it solves the problem f. the problem being in np , this is efficiently possible . if the result is valid , output it and abort . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise repeat the procedure with another random string . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of not having obtained a valid outcome after @xmath26 trials is bounded above by @xmath27 , using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ratio ] ) of the cardinality of the set of `` good '' outcomes . set @xmath28 to achieve a probability of failure smaller than @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the claim of theorem 1 is now immediate . @xmath30    </S>",
    "<S> the proof of theorem 2 requires two technical ingredients . </S>",
    "<S> the first is a concentration of measure result : let @xmath31 be a normalized vector in @xmath32 , and let @xmath2 be drawn from the unit sphere according to haar measure . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath33 this statement follows easily from standard bounds to be found e.g.in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we require the concept of an @xmath34-net @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34-net @xmath35 on the set @xmath4 of product states on @xmath26 qubits _ is a set of vectors such that @xmath36 we claim such a net exists whose cardinality is bounded by @xmath37 . indeed , from ref .  </S>",

    "<S> such that @xmath45 . </S>",

    "<S> employing the standard union bound , we find @xmath51 where the estimate ( [ eqn : fromsomen ] ) is valid if @xmath52 choosing @xmath53 , the condition above is satisfied when @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> further , eq .  ( [ eqn : intermediateprob ] ) becomes @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> now let @xmath22 be a general product vector and @xmath54 be the closest element in the @xmath34-net . then , using the operator norm @xmath55 , </S>",

    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that @xmath59 with probability greater than @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30    _ cq - universality and postbqp . </S>",
    "<S>  _ references @xcite introduced a more stringent benchmark for universal resource states . </S>",
    "<S> the authors ascribe the quality of `` cq - universality '' to a resource state if  up to local unitary corrections </S>",
    "<S>  any pure state on @xmath26 qubits can be prepared out of a sufficiently large @xmath61 qubit resource by means of local measurements on the remaining @xmath62 sites . </S>",
    "<S> as has been shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , efficient cq - universality is a strictly stronger requirement than the notion of universality used in the present paper . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the results presented above already imply that generic states are not cq - universal . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can strengthen the statement : most states fail to be cq - universal , even if we assume we had the power to _ choose _ the local measurement outcomes .    to put this into perspective , </S>",
    "<S> recall that models of quantum computing with the assumed capability of choosing the outcome of at least one measurement have been analyzed under the label of _ post - selected _ quantum computing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity class of decision problems efficiently decidable on post - selected computers is postbqp . </S>",
    "<S> it is known @xcite that postbqp @xmath63 pp @xmath64 np  which implies that the capability to postselect dramatically increases the computational strength of quantum computers ( unless pp @xmath65 bqp ) .    </S>",
    "<S> for generic states in the cq - setting , however , postselection does not seem to help . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the dramatic majority of states are not efficiently cq - universal , even if we ( i ) assume the power to choose the outcome of the local measurements , ( ii ) allow for any fixed error @xmath34 in the output fidelity , ( iii ) ask only for the capability to prepare a single product state , and ( iv ) make no a priori assumption on which sites the final state should end up in .    </S>",
    "<S> we proceed to prove the claim . </S>",
    "<S> fix a subset @xmath66 of @xmath26 sites ( the `` output register '' ) of a given n - qubit resource state @xmath2 . combining lemma iii.5 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with theorem 2 above , we find that for a random resource @xmath2 and fixed @xmath67 , @xmath68 with probability at least @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the supremum is over product states @xmath22 on @xmath66 and @xmath70 on @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> there are fewer than @xmath72 choices for @xmath73 of cardinality @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the preceeding bound is true for all such @xmath66 simultaneously with probability no smaller than @xmath74 the claim follows by taking @xmath75 and @xmath76 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ efficiently preparable states and concrete examples .  _ while conceptually relevant , generic haar - random states on large systems can not be efficiently prepared . in this section , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the effect that `` too much entanglement '' impedes computational efficiency can also be identified in more physically relevant states .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we exhibit a family of efficiently preparable states @xmath77 on @xmath0 qubits , for which @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> these values of the geometric measure are high enough to rule out the possibility that such families offer an exponential speedup for the kind of problems considered above . </S>",
    "<S> constructing explicit states which can not cause even a super - polynomial increase in computational power remains an open problem @xcite .     the tree - tensor network or instance of a mera @xcite that gives rise to states with high geometric entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> each of the boxes represents a unitary.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the states are related to the mera construction introduced in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in order to capture the properties of critical , scale invariant states . </S>",
    "<S> fix a dimension @xmath79 and choose a unitary @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> define @xmath81 by @xmath82 . for every @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> , we construct the state @xmath83 on @xmath84 qudits by concatenating the maps @xmath85 in a tree - like fashion as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mera ] . now set @xmath86 and choose @xmath87 randomly for every @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> recall that , by the solovay - kitaev theorem @xcite , general unitaries in @xmath88 can be efficiently approximated by a quantum circuit in a time polynomial in @xmath89 and polylogarithmic in the error . </S>",
    "<S> employing once more standard concentration of measure arguments @xcite , one easily finds that @xmath90 thus , @xmath91 maps any product state @xmath92 to a vector @xmath70 with @xmath93 ( asymptotically ) . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the lowest layer of @xmath94 s in the definition of @xmath83 sends any unit - norm product vector on @xmath0 qudits to a product vector on @xmath95 qudits , with squared norm at most @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> inducting over all layers and using the appropriate base-@xmath79 logarithm in the definition of geometric measure for qudits , we conclude @xcite @xmath97 turning to the cq - setting , it is easy to identify states whose efficiency as a resource is limited by the presence of correlations which can , on average , not be removed by means of local measurements . </S>",
    "<S> consider the ground state @xmath98 of a _ critical model _ with two - point correlation functions between the sites @xmath99 fulfilling @xmath100 with @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> assume we could prepare a three - qubit cluster state @xmath102 on some `` output register '' . </S>",
    "<S> we allow for local unitary corrections , and an average trace - norm error of @xmath34 , so that , with @xmath103 it holds that @xmath104 here , @xmath105 is the probability of obtaining a certain sequence of measurement outcomes . noting that the qubits associated with sites @xmath99 are uncorrelated for @xmath106 , one easily derives that the size of the resource must scale as @xmath107 . </S>",
