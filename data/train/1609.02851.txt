    "<S> solid - state quantum emitters have long been recognised as the ideal platform to realize integrated quantum photonic technologies . </S>",
    "<S> we use a self - assembled negatively charged qd in a low q - factor photonic micropillar to demonstrate for the first time a key figure of merit for deterministic switching and spin - photon entanglement : a shift in phase of an input single photon of @xmath0 with values of up to @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) measured value represents an important threshold : above this value input photons interact with the emitter deterministically . </S>",
    "<S> a deterministic photon - emitter interaction is the only viable scalable means to achieve several vital functionalities not possible in linear optics such as quantum switches and entanglement gates . </S>",
    "<S> our experimentally determined value is limited by mode mismatch between the input laser and the cavity , qd spectral fluctuations and spin relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> we determine that up to @xmath5 of the collected photons have interacted with the qd and undergone a phase shift of @xmath6 .    quantum dots ( qds ) </S>",
    "<S> have long been proposed as key components in quantum optical circuits . in principle </S>",
    "<S> they are capable of producing single photons on demand  @xcite , and acting as a  mediator \" qubit that allows indirect interactions between two photonic qubits . </S>",
    "<S> dramatic progress has been made very recently with qd sources , with record - breaking brightness and indistinguishable single photons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however qds can be exploited not just as sources , but as quantum switches , memories and entanglers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most useful potential functionalities is as a spin - photon interface . in the absence of a magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> a qd charged with an excess electron has two degenerate spin - dependent transitions that couple to opposite circularly polarized light states . by maximising the interaction of the qd with light </S>",
    "<S> , one may use the qd transition to  switch \" the phase , @xmath7 , of a single photon by up to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction is maximum when directly on resonance with the transition , and reduces with spectral detuning . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is by combining this with the selection rules for each spin transition that one may achieve more powerful operations . </S>",
    "<S> one may selectively phase shift one component of a linearly polarized photon ( e.g. the right circular component @xmath8 only ) by initialising the spin ( e.g. @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> interference between the interacting and non - interacting components induces a  giant \" faraday rotation of the linear polarisation up to @xmath10 ( e.g. from vertical to horizontal )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this switches the photon from one polarisation to an orthogonal one , controlled by the spin . </S>",
    "<S> spin - photon entanglement naturally ensues by preparing the spin into an equal superposition state : @xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> .    however , for this functionality one requires  deterministic \" interactions , i.e. the ability of the quantum emitter to switch the photon between orthogonal polarization states . </S>",
    "<S> this represents the ultimate limit in strong non - linear interactions and requires significant control of the photonic environment around the qd . </S>",
    "<S> several approaches to deterministic interactions have been taken , most notably in the achievement of  strong coupling \" via high q - factor , low modal volume cavities  @xcite as inspired by atom - cavity physics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in such qd systems a @xmath12 phase shift was observed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent demonstrations have measured a @xmath6 phase switch on the qd spin , upon the successful detection of a rotated photon  @xcite . however , in that work as in others , the high quality - factor ( q - factor ) design of the cavity means out of plane scattering limits the input and output coupling efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> this limits the phase shift imparted on reflected photons and thus the probability of observing a rotation , making subsequent spin - photon entanglement protocols inefficient . </S>",
    "<S> we now demonstrate the next step to a fully deterministic spin - photon interface , showing a phase switch imparted on the photon instead of the spin . </S>",
    "<S> this is made possible by taking a different approach , where we use a very low q - factor micropillar cavity with well - defined input and output modes . </S>",
    "<S> key here is that the coupling of the input and output modes with the qd should be higher than the  leaky \" modes . </S>",
    "<S> this is parametrised by the  @xmath13-factor \" , related to the ratio of these two ( see supplementary ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has been theoretically established that very weak intensity narrow bandwidth photons input and collected from such a mode will undergo deterministic  @xcite interaction with the qd if @xmath14  @xcite , in contrast for a @xmath15 not all photons interact with the qd thus a maximum phase of only @xmath16 can maximally be detected ( see fig .  [ fig:1n](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can show that under these conditions , the scattered light always undergoes a phase shift of @xmath6 in the absence of pure dephasing effects , the threshold for this behaviour is @xmath17 with a discontinuous jump from @xmath16 to @xmath6 for @xmath14 . interference between </S>",
    "<S> the incoming and scattered light leads to a deterministic scattering of the light backwards , with the intensity ( @xmath18 ) of backscattered light scaling with @xmath13-factor as @xmath19  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our previous work  @xcite has shown phase shifts @xmath20 from a micropillar system when a single frequency laser was tuned through the resonant frequency of the qd . </S>",
    "<S> in that device ( @xmath21 ) , the @xmath13-factor was estimated to be @xmath22  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we expect to be in the regime where a @xmath6 phase shift should be observed for reflected photons . </S>",
    "<S> the low phase shift actually measured in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite results from two experimental limitations : the limit in precise mode - matching of the input laser to the micropillar mode resulting in a fraction of laser light that reflects without entering the cavity , and the presence of spectral  jitter \" which leads to a change in frequency of the qd transition over a timescale shorter than the laser scan time . </S>",
    "<S> this detunes the qd relative to the laser ( @xmath23 ) and reduces the observed phase shift . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that by measuring the phase shift faster than the spectral jitter time , one may obtain a measure of the phase shift which is limited only by the mode - matching limitations . by using a specially designed two - channel heralding technique , we explore time windows when the qd remains close to resonance with the laser , and measure the phase shift of light reflected from the qd - micropillar system . </S>",
    "<S> we measure all the light reflected from the pillar , without using polarization filtering . </S>",
    "<S> we consistently evaluate phase shift values @xmath3 when the qd is close to resonance ( @xmath24 ) where @xmath25 is the linewidth of the transition . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that in the rare cases where we remain precisely on resonance ( @xmath26 , we measure phase shifts of up to @xmath27 . we therefore conclude that we reach the @xmath3 threshold , confirming that @xmath14 , and that only mode - matching limits our measured phase shift .     </S>",
    "<S> beamsplitter ( bs ) splits the reflected signal into two channels . </S>",
    "<S> one which sends photons to detectors @xmath28 to perform the phase measurement defined in the main text , and a second channel which is split by a polarising beamsplitter ( pbs ) into co - poarised and cross - polarised components which are measured by detectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively.(*b * ) energy level diagram of a negatively charged qd in a faraday magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> measurements are performed on light that is resonantly scattered from the spin down transition . </S>",
    "<S> ( * c * ) with the black circles the dependence of the maximum possible phase shift on the @xmath13-factor with @xmath31 in units of @xmath6.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the setup used is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1n ] , and is similar to that in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is placed in a @xmath32 magnetic field along the optical axis ( faraday geometry ) inducing an energy splitting of @xmath33 between the @xmath34 and @xmath9 ground state ( fig 1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> vertically linearly polarized coherent light ( @xmath35 ) from a single frequency laser of linewidth @xmath36 ( over @xmath37 ) is focused on the micropillar with an @xmath38 objective . </S>",
    "<S> it is then spectrally tuned to maximise the cross - polarised count - rate , upon reflection from the spin @xmath9 transition , which interacts with @xmath8 ( @xmath39 ) light . </S>",
    "<S> the reflected signal is split into two with a non - polarizing beamsplitter ( bs1 ) : one arm is sent to the  heralding \" channel , apd - s 5 ( vertical-@xmath40 ) and 6 ( horizontal-@xmath41 ) ; the other arm is sent to the phase measurement arm , where four components of the field are measured , apd1 ( @xmath40 ) , apd-2 ( @xmath41 ) , apd3 ( @xmath42 ) and apd4 ( @xmath43 ) . to calculate the phase shift , we monitor the  swing \" in counts from @xmath40 to @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the light emerging from the qd - micropillar will both have undergone a faraday rotation ( @xmath44 ) and show some ellipticity . </S>",
    "<S> this is because for @xmath45 , there are qd scattering losses affecting only the interacting , @xmath39 light , while @xmath46 of the non - interacting @xmath47 light is reflected back into the mode ( assuming a single sided cavity ) . to normalise to the elipticity we measure the phase shift using @xmath48 </S>",
    "<S> this is an estimate of the true phase accounting for ellipticity caused by losses ( see supplementary ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our previous measurements revealed that sub - second timescale spectral jitter of the qd transition broadened the fourier transform limited @xmath49 transition to the measured linewidth ( @xmath50 ) , and is a commonly reported problem that is thought to occur due to spectral wander ( nuclear spin and charge fluctuations )  @xcite . to overcome this </S>",
    "<S> , we measure the phase shift in @xmath51 time intervals , smaller than the expected jitter and electron spin relaxation timescales , but sufficiently long to collect reliable statistics . </S>",
    "<S> we then monitor the cross - polarised detector ( apd-6 , @xmath41 ) , where we measure an average count - rate of @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> cross - polarized counts are only observed when the laser is on resonance with the qd and undergoes a faraday rotation with a non - zero projection onto h. in non - cavity experiments this is the channel where cross - polarised resonant scattering is detected  @xcite . since the qd is seldom found close to resonance with the laser , </S>",
    "<S> the cross - polarised time - averaged count - rate is low . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](a ) shows a histogram of the distribution of the count - rate in @xmath51 time bins for the cross - polarized channel ( apd-6 ) . despite the vast majority ( @xmath53 ) of time bins containing low count - rates </S>",
    "<S> , the histogram shows that high count - rates are found for some @xmath51 time windows , with a second peak in the distribution at @xmath54 , and outliers that show up to @xmath55 count - rates . </S>",
    "<S> these occur when the qd and laser are close to resonant , as one would expect that the higher the count - rate , the closer the qd is to exact resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> we expect that when the cross - polarized count - rates in the heralding arm are high , the phase shift of input photons will also be significant . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](a ) also shows the phase shift measured for each value of the herald apd-6 . </S>",
    "<S> one sees that as the cross - polarized herald count - rates increase , the phase shift does also , with a value saturating at @xmath56 for apd-6@xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this represents @xmath51 average response when the input laser is within the linewidth of the transform limited qd transition . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , high cross - polarized herald counts do not correlate with a steadily increasing measured phase . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the number of cross - polarized heralds arriving at apd-6 is affected by power fluctuations of the input laser which is normalised out when we measure the phase .        </S>",
    "<S> one can gain more information by including measurements of the co ( apd-5 ) channel . </S>",
    "<S> efficient coherent scattering from the qd will result in light rotating from @xmath58 , causing a significant intensity reduction in the directly reflected channel , i.e. the co - polarized counts should decrease . </S>",
    "<S> this should also occur just as the cross - polarized counts increase . </S>",
    "<S> this anti - correlation gives a more accurate measure of when the qd is on resonance , as it reduces the influence of uncorrelated background counts between the two channels . </S>",
    "<S> to explore this fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b ) shows a 2d histogram revealing the correlation in the count distribution between the co and cross channels of the herald arm ( apd-5,6 ) , again , for @xmath51 time bins . a clear pattern emerges . </S>",
    "<S> by far the largest majority of time bins populate a region where the co - polarized counts are high , and the cross - polarized counts are low . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum in the distribution occurs for apd-5 ( co ) @xmath591mhz , and apd-6 ( cross ) @xmath5950khz . at this point </S>",
    "<S> , we expect that the qd is not close to resonance with the laser , and that the phase shift measured will be low . </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed by the plot in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](c ) , showing the measured phase associated with the time bins for each co / cross point in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b ) . for all values where co  @xmath60400khz , the cross value is always  @xmath61250khz , and the measured phase is @xmath62 .    however , it is also clear that there is a distribution of time bins where cross count - rate values are larger than the co count - rates . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](b ) shows a region for cross  @xmath60250khz and co  @xmath61250khz , where a  hot - spot \" occurs with a clear distribution centered at 420khz in the cross - polarised channel and 140khz in the co - polarised channel . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of seeing counts in this region is @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of seeing such events due to the poissonian statistics alone is negligible : @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the complete reversal in the distribution of count - rates between apd-5 , and 6 on its own already indicates a phase shift exceeding @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> a very crude estimate of the phase shift obtained by using the ratio @xmath65 would give a value of @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> however , one needs to be careful in using these values : using selected heralded data introduces a bias to the measurements , and one must also take into account the spin - selective loss in the cavity , as noted before . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig:1]c shows the average unbiased phase shift measurements from the phase shift arm plotted as a function of the heralding count - rates in apd-5 and -6 . </S>",
    "<S> the average phase shift for the hot - spot region ( apd-5 @xmath61250khz , apd-6 @xmath60250khz ) gives a consistent phase shift of @xmath670.45@xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> further , there are clearly  pockets \" in the data where the phase shift is higher than @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular one observes the highest phase shifts for very low @xmath68 ratios in the herald arm . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that there are specific time windows that allow the highest phase shifts to be measured . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate that to measure a @xmath69 phase shift , the laser should be within @xmath70 of the peak of the @xmath71ev linewidth transition . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate that this should occur @xmath72 of the time ( assuming inhomogeneous broadening of a 0.7@xmath73ev qd line to 5@xmath73ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also require that enough photon counts can be gathered in the time window in question to overcome poissonian statistics , and that the @xmath74 spin lifetime of the transition is longer than the time bin used . by varying the time bin width </S>",
    "<S> we determine a spin @xmath74 time of 250@xmath73s and a spectral jitter time of @xmath75 ( see supplementary ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finding the instances where near exact resonance conditions are fulfilled , will allow the highest phase shift possible to be measured . the highest phase shift measured in the 100@xmath73s bins in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](c ) corresponds to @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however by analysing a range of time bin lengths we find several regions with phase shifts @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> for a shorter time bin of @xmath78 we find a maximum phase shift of @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the limit in the phase shift measured is due to background counts , i.e. that some photons have reflected from the top of the pillar , due to mode mismatch between the mode of the laser into the microscope objective and the micropillar cavity mode . </S>",
    "<S> a phase shift of @xmath81 implies that @xmath5980% of the photons input into the pillar are collected and have interacted with the qd . </S>",
    "<S> thus the numerical aperture / spatial overlap ( mode - matching ) between the input laser and cavity mode is @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath5 interaction efficiency is good , it is also clear that extremely good mode - matching is required to reduce background counts ( @xmath82 mode - matching is required for @xmath83 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this could possibly be achieved using an integrated fibre approach  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that using a low q - factor , high efficiency qd microcavity system , one may achieve deterministic photon - spin interactions , by inducing a @xmath3 phase shift on a narrow bandwidth single photon . </S>",
    "<S> we measure by far the largest ever photon phase shift from a solid state quantum emitter . while this qd - micropillar system is somewhat lossy , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 of the reflected photons in the collection channel undergo a deterministic @xmath6 phase shift . </S>",
    "<S> two challenges need to be surmounted before the qd - micropillar can be used as a single photon switch or entangler . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , spectral jitter of the qd transition arising from charge fluctuations around the qd is problematic as only @xmath84 of the time photons are in resonance with the transition , where they meet our heralding condition . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the spectral jitter occurs on a ms timescale , electric field gates applied as part of a feedback circuit , as shown in  @xcite are viable . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , exceptional reduction in background scatter and @xmath85 optical mode matching is required to achieve a near deterministic @xmath6 phase shift . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , this device demonstrates that deterministic and efficient spin - induced photon switching and spin - photon entangling operations are feasible with a solid - state emitter .    </S>",
