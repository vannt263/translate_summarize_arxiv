    "it is generally accepted that the near - infrared ( nir ) and x - ray flares in sagittarius a * , the compact radio source associated with a mass @xmath0 supermassive black hole at the galactic center ( schdel et al . 2002 ; ghez et al . 2004 ; the schwarzschild radius @xmath1 ) cm ) , are produced by relativistic electrons within a few schwarzschild radii of the black hole via synchrotron and synchrotron self - comptonization ( ssc ) processes , respectively ( baganoff et al . 2001 , 2003 ; genzel et al .",

    "the electrons are likely accelerated by turbulent plasma waves generated in an accretion torus via instabilities , which induce the release of gravitational energy of the plasma ( balbus & hawley 1991 ; tagger & melia 2006 ) . in the simplest case ,",
    "in which there is no large scale magnetic field , the turbulent magnetic field @xmath2 can play the dual role of both heating the electrons ( presumably via resonant wave particle interactions ) and cooling them ( via ssc radiation ) , since the heating and cooling rates have different energy dependencies .",
    "earlier , we showed that the _ steady - state _ electron spectrum can be approximated as a relativistic maxwellian distribution with the `` temperature '' @xmath3 depending on the plasma density @xmath4 and the coherent length of the magnetic field , which should be comparable to the size of the flare region @xmath5 .",
    "simultaneous spectroscopic observations in the nir and x - ray bands ( with four measured quantities : fluxes and spectral indexes in both bands ) can then be used to determine the four basic model parameters , namely @xmath2 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath4 , and to test the model ( liu et al .",
    "2006a , 2006b ) .    these investigations , however , also indicated that the steady - state solutions are not always applicable , especially for nir flares with very soft spectra .",
    "a time - dependent approach to the evolution of the electron distribution under the influence of the turbulent magnetic field is required to study the flares in quantitative details . in light of the recent discovery of a correlation between the flux @xmath7 and the spectral index @xmath8 in the nir band ( ghez et al . 2005 ; gillessen et al .",

    "we show that relativistic maxwellian distributions in general give a good description of the electron spectra with the corresponding `` temperature '' evolution determined by the initial temperature , the magnetic field and its coherent length and the gas density .",
    "it is therefore possible to couple these results with mhd simulations to study the radiative characteristics of collisionless plasmas self - consistently .",
    "several scenarios have been suggested to explain the observed correlation between flux and spectral index ( gillessen et al .",
    "we find here that the dynamical processes of plasma heating and cooling are the most likely mechanism and the observation requires that the magnetic field be anti - correlated with the electron temperature . since the evolution of the magnetic field depends on the turbulence generation mechanism , which needs to be addressed via mhd simulations , we calculate the evolution of the electron distribution function and the corresponding radiation spectrum for a cooling and a heating phase , where the magnetic field is set to be inversely proportional to the mean electron energy .",
    "the model naturally recovers the observed correlation between the nir flux and spectral index and predicts the x - ray emission characteristics accompanying the nir flares .",

    "the shape of the correlation , however , does not change dramatically . we therefore conclude that for a constant ( and uniform ) magnetic field the observed correlation between flux and spectral index in the nir band can marginally be attributed to the cooling of a plasma heated up instantaneously at the onset of the flare .    adiabatic expansion or compression and doppler boosting have also been suggested to explain the correlations between spectral index and flux during flares ( yusef - zadeh et al .",

    "@xmath84 is approximately a constant under the lorentz transform .",
    "the correlation between @xmath85 and @xmath8 due to doppler boosting effects is therefore given by the correlation between @xmath86 and @xmath8 , which is much flatter than the correlation between @xmath71 and @xmath8 and therefore can not explain the observations .",
    "we conclude that in a constant and uniform magnetic field only ssc cooling of a hot plasma heated instantaneously is marginally in agreement with the observed spectral index and flux correlation in the nir band .",
    "turbulent heating , adiabatic processes and doppler effects produce a correlation which is much flatter than the observed results .      to improve the model fitting to the observed correlations",
    ", we next consider the scenario where the magnetic field is variable .",
    "the correlation between flux and spectral index is depicted by the correlation between @xmath87 and @xmath8 . for a relativistic maxwellian distribution with a temperature @xmath79 ,",
    "if @xmath88 is a constant in time , @xmath87 is proportional to @xmath89 .",
    "as shown in the right panel of figure [ fig7.ps ] , the correlation of the solid line gives a better fit to the observations than all models discussed above .",
    "we note , however , that for @xmath8 increasing from -4 to 1 , the temperature of the plasma has to increase by about three orders of magnitude ( liu et al .",

    ", we recover the result with a constant magnetic field .",
    "it is clear that @xmath91 has to be positive and less than 2 to make the flux and spectral index correlation steeper , implying an anti - correlation between the magnetic field and the mean electron energy during the flare evolution .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ fig7.ps ] ( right ) corresponds to @xmath94 , which fits the correlation in the soft- and dim- state but predicts a spectrum , which is softer than the observed ones when the flux is high . on the other hand , the recent re - analyses of the keck observations of flares from sagittarius a * appear to favor such a scenario ( krabbe et al .",
    "2006 ) .    to take into account the heating and cooling effects , we choose a magnetic field inversely proportional to @xmath42 during the evolution of the flare , which makes the heating and cooling rates depend on the electron distribution .",
    "compared with the heating and cooling processes studied in   [ acc ] , one more parameter is needed to obtain the solutions : the initial magnetic field .",
    "this parameter also sets the characteristic timescale of the system , which is related to the initial value of @xmath20 . using an explicit number scheme with the time steps scaled as @xmath95",
    ", we calculate the evolution of the synchrotron spectrum for a cooling and heating phase .",

    "a relatively large temperature change is chosen to produce significant variation of the synchrotron spectral index .",
    "the dashed line in the right panel gives the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "although the initial magnetic field is relatively low , the steady state magnetic field is @xmath102 gauss , which is much higher than the typical value for the quiescent state .",
    "the dashed lines in figure [ fig9.ps ] show the light curves of the flux ( left ) and spectral index ( right ) for the cooling phase .",
    "we note that the correlation between the flux and spectral index mostly occurs between 130 to 160 minutes . before 130 minutes",
    ", the system evolves slowly due to the relatively lower magnetic field ( @xmath103 gauss ) . because the magnetic field in the accretion torus in sagittarius a * is about a few tens of gauss in the quiescent state ,",
    "the evolution before 100 minutes is likely irrelevant to flares in sagittarius a * since the magnetic field is below 10 gauss during this period . from 100 to 170 minutes the model predicted correlation is quite in line with observations .",
    "the model not only produces the correct correlation slope , but also recovers the typical variation timescale of a few tens of minutes .",
    "after 170 minutes , the system reaches a steady state .",
    "the dips near @xmath104 mins in the flux and spectral index light curves are related to the turn around of the spectral index and flux correlation before reaching the steady - state .",
    "these are caused by the sharp cutoff ( sharper than an exponential cutoff ) of the electron spectra in the cooling phase , which makes the spectra softer than that of a relativistic maxwellian distribution . to produce a flare state with @xmath105 and @xmath106 mjy , the total number of electrons involved in the flare @xmath107 , giving rise to @xmath108 cm and @xmath109 @xmath110 .",

    "the heating phase proceeds much faster than the cooling phase due to the relatively high initial magnetic field and final temperature .",
    "the flux reaches the peak value within @xmath114 minutes , after which the spectral index saturates near 0.2 , and both the magnetic field and flux decrease slowly . to produce even harder spectra",
    ", one has to increase the value of @xmath115 at the steady state dramatically ( liu et al .",
    "2006b ) , making the heating phase proceed on an even shorter timescale ( @xmath116 ) . a very weak initial magnetic field ( @xmath117 gauss ) and a very high temperature ( @xmath118 )",
    "are required to produce hard nir spectra and a flux rising time of a few minutes . to produce a flare state with @xmath105 and @xmath106 mjy , the total number of electrons involved in the flare @xmath119 , which is more than ten times larger than that in the cooling phase .",
    "this leads to @xmath120 cm and @xmath121 @xmath110 .",
    "in general the spectral index @xmath8 of the above models is always less than @xmath122 . to produce even harder spectra",
    ", one has to introduce self - absorption effects . for an electron temperature @xmath123 , the size of the emission region",
    "is then given by @xmath124 which is much smaller than any relevant length scales .",
    "we therefore do not expect nir flares with spectral indexes larger than @xmath122 .",
    "any solid detection of very hard nir spectra will rule out this model and may be in conflict with any synchrotron models .",
    "the spectrum of the comptonization component and its evolution should be quite different for the two phases , and may be used to distinguish between them . figure [ fig10.ps ] shows the evolution of the radiation spectrum during the cooling ( left ) and heating ( right ) phases . besides indicating the initial and steady - state spectra , we highlight the spectral evolution when the correlation between nir flux and spectral index are prominent , corresponding to the shaded periods in figure [ fig9.ps ] and figure [ fig11.ps ] , where the spectra are indicated by filled circles . for the model parameters chosen in  [ vmag ] , because the electron column depth @xmath125 in the cooling phase is 50 times that in the heating phase while their synchrotron luminosities are comparable , much more high energy emission is produced via ssc in the cooling phase .    in analogy to equation ( [ epss ] ) , one can define a dimensionless ssc flux density spectrum @xmath126 the left panel of figure [ fig11.ps ] shows the evolution of @xmath127 at @xmath128 ( thin lines ) and @xmath129 hz ( thick lines ) for the cooling ( dashed lines ) and heating ( solid lines ) phases . as expected , higher energy emission precedes ( lags ) lower energy emission slightly during the cooling ( heating ) phase because they are produced by more energetic electrons .",
    "however the difference in the peak times is within 10 minutes and may not be distinguished with the capacities of current instruments .",
    "the time delay between the nir and x - ray peaks is also within 30 minutes .",
    "we therefore expect a good correlation between the nir and x - ray flux densities .",
    "the right panel shows the corresponding correlation between @xmath130 and the x - ray spectral index @xmath131 .",
    "this correlation gives a correlation between the x - ray flux density and spectral index , which can be tested with observations .",
    "interestingly the x - ray flux density peaks near @xmath132 , which explains the hardness of x - ray spectra .",
    "the above studies clearly show that if the plasma producing the flares does not have complicated structure , the observed correlation between the spectral index and flux in the nir band can only be explained by the cooling model with a magnetic field inversely proportional to the mean energy of the electrons .",
    "this is especially true if the total number of electrons involved does not change and the electron energy distribution is roughly uniform throughout the flare region .",
    "other models either fit the observed correlation marginally or predict very weak dependence of the spectral index on the flux in the hard spectral states , which is inconsistent with observations .    on the other hand , the flare region may have complicated source structure .",
    "the amount of electrons involved in producing the soft state emission can be quite different from that producing the hard state emission . if the electron distribution can be approximated as a maxwellian spectrum , as is likely true , the observed correlation can then be used to determine the source structure . as shown in section   [ conb ] , @xmath8 only depends on @xmath133 , and @xmath85 also depends on @xmath134 . for a given magnetic field ,",
    "the observed correlation can be used to give a relation between the temperature @xmath79 and the total number of electrons at such a temperature , which may shed light on the instabilities triggering the flares .",
    "one may also assume that the sum of the electron and magnetic field pressures is a constant in the flaring region .",
    "the observed correlation can also lead to a measurement of the amount of plasma at different temperatures .",
    "it is probably more natural to use mhd simulations to produce some flaring regions .",
    "the formalism developed in this paper can then be used to calculate the radiation spectrum . by comparing with the observed correlation , one",
    "can then determine what kind of active regions are likely responsible for the flares .",
    "it is clear that the ssc spectra are quite different for all these scenarios and simultaneous spectroscopic observations in the nir and x - ray bands can be used to distinguish these models .",
    "current observations do not justify such a comprehensive investigation , which is also beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "flares from the direction of the supermassive black hole in the galactic center are produced within a few schwarzschild radii .",
    "studying the details of the flare properties plays an important role in understanding the physics of black hole accretion . to infer the underlying physical processes with simultaneous spectroscopic observations over a broad frequency range",
    ", the plasma process of electron acceleration has to be addressed . given the closeness of the flare variation timescale , the dynamical time at the last stable orbit of the black hole , and the synchrotron cooling time of electrons producing nir emission during the flares , a time dependent study of the particle acceleration is necessary .",
    "although there are already attempts to carry out this study analytically ( becker et al . 2006 ; schlickeiser 1984 )",
    ", numerical solutions are required when specific events are considered .    in this paper",
    "we study the time dependent solutions of electron heating and cooling by a turbulent magnetic field . when the amplitudes of large scale magnetic fields are much smaller than the turbulent component , there are four basic model parameters , namely the magnetic field and its coherent length , the gas density and the initial distribution of electrons .",
    "electrons gain energy from the plasma waves and loss energy via radiation , and the energy dependences of the heating and cooling rates are quite different .",
    "the evolution of the electron distribution is determined by these parameters .",
    "we show that for the optically thin collisionless plasma in sagittarius a * , synchrotron cooling dominates and relativistic maxwellian distributions usually give a good description of the electron spectra .",
    "a formula is given to describe the dependence of the temperature evolution on the model parameters , which can be coupled with mhd simulations to study the radiation properties of the plasma .",
    "we demonstrate that it is not trivial to produce the observed correlation between the spectral index and flux in the nir band .",
    "doppler effects and adiabatic processes suggested previously for the correlation ( gillessen et al .",
    "2006 ; yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "2006b ) can not reproduce the observed results unless one has a very unusual electron spectrum .",
    "if the magnetic field does not change dramatically during the flare , only the cooling model of electrons heated instantaneously at the flare onset fits the observed correlation marginally .",
    "all other models predict very weak dependence of the spectral index on the flux density in the relatively hard spectral states .",
    "we argue that the dynamical processes of electrons heating and cooling give the most reasonable explanation for the observations . to fit the correlation , the magnetic field needs to be anti - correlated with the electron temperature to reduce the flux density in the hard spectral states , bringing the above theoretical predictions more in line with the observations .",
    "it is not clear what mechanism may be responsible for such an anti - correlation .",
    "one possibility is that the dependence of the heating rate on the magnetic field is not as strong as that of the cooling rate .",
    "for example , the heating rate may be determined by the sound velocity , which can be much higher than the alfvn velocity . moreover",
    ", the cooling due to inverse comptonization will dominate when the electron temperature and column depth are very high , which is certainly the case in the early cooling phase .",
    "all these effects can give rise to the desired anti - correlation .    the required anti - correlation between the magnetic field intensity and the electron mean energy suggests efficient energy exchanges between the field and electrons . while magnetic reconnection can cause transfer of magnetic field energy into electrons ( corresponding to the heating phase ) , it is not clear what mechanism are responsible for the increase of magnetic field in the cooling phase .",
    "if the flare region is in pressure equilibrium with a relatively stable background , the magnetic field pressure may increase as the electron pressure decreases due to cooling .",
    "we note that the magnetic field pressure increases from 1.27 to @xmath135 ergs @xmath110 and the electron pressure decreases from @xmath136 to @xmath137 ergs @xmath110 in the cooling phase of the flare discussed in   [ vmag ] . for the heating phase ,",
    "the magnetic field pressure decreases from @xmath138 to 0.32 ergs @xmath110 , while the electron pressure increases from 2.1 to @xmath139 ergs @xmath110 .",
    "although the pressures are far from equipartition in the initial and final states , the observed correlation is produced when the two are evolving toward an equipartition .",
    "these suggest that the flares are triggered by a process , which drives the energy densities of the magnetic field and electrons far from equipartition .",
    "the relaxation of the system toward energy equipartition produces the observed correlation .",
    "it is therefore critical to produce and/or identify features far from energy equipartition in mhd simulations to uncover the physical processes driving the flares .",
    "it is also possible that the flare region has complicated structure .",
    "the results of the electron spectral evolution presented here , which are also applicable to the relatively quiescent - state of the accretion flow , then need to be coupled with mhd simulations to study the radiation characteristics of the accretion flow .",
    "the observed correlation between spectral index and flux suggests that , if the magnetic field does not change dramatically during the flare and through the flare region , more electrons are involved in producing the softer spectral state flux .",
    "regions with small hot cores flashing in a extended lower temperature active envelope in mhd simulations may be identified with the flares .",
