    "the cosmic ray background consists of several different particles such as pions , electrons , protons , etc .",

    "experiments can be shielded from this cosmic activity by going deep underground . in this paper",
    "we describe a measurement of the cosmic ray muon flux at the waste isolation pilot plant ( wipp ) with an overburden of 655 m of rock and salt and located 30 miles east of carlsbad , new mexico @xcite .",
    "such measurements are useful in assessing the appropriateness of wipp as a site for underground experiments that require shielding from cosmic radiation .",
    "the depth requirements and adequacy of a particular site vary depending on the nature and goals of a particular experiment .",
    "this paper does not attempt to address the appropriateness of the wipp site as a general purpose underground laboratory , an exercise of intense activity within the scientific community at present .",
    "such a task is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the paper focuses on the measurements of the muon flux at wipp , which serves as an important input in evaluating the impact on specific experiments .",
    "the experiment to measure the muon flux in the underground of wipp was conducted 655 meters below the surface in the experimental q - area .",
    "the detector consisted of two plastic scintillator panels each 305  cm long , 76.2  cm wide and 2.54  cm thick .",
    "each panel had two light - guides mounted on the two narrow ends .",
    "a 12.7  cm diameter photo - tube with an operating voltage of 800 volts was mounted on each light - guide enabling a double ended readout .",
    "the muon detection efficiency as a function of position for each panel was measured by placing two small scintillators above and below .",
    "if the small detectors triggered coincident , a muon must have passed through the large panel .",
    "the number of events in the panel over the total number of triggers gives therefore the muon detection efficiency .",
    "each position was tested with 10,000 coincidence events .",
    "high energy , minimum ionizing muons would deposit about 5  mev when traversing a scintillator paddle at normal incidence . the actual energy spectrum deposited in",
    "the patel exhibits a broad tail around this pronounced peak due to muons traversing at angles other than normal , straggling effects , and the finite energy resolution of the scintillator .",
    "nonetheless , by summing the signal heights from the pmt s of each panel with a threshold of 3 mev , a clean muon signal can be obtained well above the electronic noise and low energy gamma background associated with a single pmt channel .",
    "the detector efficiency for muons was found to be  100@xmath3% for all positions .    for the actual experiment panel 1",
    "was mounted on top of panel 2 in a distance of 30.5  cm ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) . a fourfold coincidence from the photo - tubes",
    "was required to record an event .",
    "the high voltage on each photo - multiplier tube ( pmt ) was adjusted by demanding an equal pulse height for a @xmath4sr calibration source place in the center of each panel .",
    "the decay product of @xmath4sr is @xmath4y which decays emitting high energy electrons , which were detected in the panel .",
    "[ electronicsetup ] shows the electronic diagram .",
    "the pre - amplifier signal had a rise time of 10  ns to 20  ns .",
    "it was split up and one signal was fed through a spectroscopic amplifier with a shaping time of 0.25  @xmath5s and connected to an lecroy ad811 adc .",
    "the other signal was put into a discriminator with a 175  mv threshold which was equivalent to an energy of 1.1  mev .",
    "the steep nim pulses from the discriminators were used as input for a coincidence unit .",
    "[ mtime ] illustrates the timing for the different components during an event .",
    "the coincidence window had a width of 100  ns .",
    "the output of the coincidence was then processed by a gate / delay generator and used as strobe for the adc .",
    "the strobe window was chosen to be 0.5  @xmath5s wide .",
    "this ensured that the peak from the spectroscopic amplifier was inside the adc strobe window .",
    "the experiment was conducted during a run - time of 6.17 days .",
    "panel one had a slightly better resolution than panel two .",
    "this was due to an increased noise in photo tube 3 .",
    "the total charge in a panel was calculated as the sum of the outputs of its two pmts .    to determine the energy calibration of the detectors monte - carlo simulations",
    "were carried out with geant 4 .",
    "the initial energy distribution of the muons simulated was derived from the following empirical formula corrected for the energy losses in 655  m of rock and salt @xcite : @xmath6 @xmath7 being in gev / c .",

    "the total muon spectrum for each panel was achieved by adding the adc values of both photo tubes up on an event - by - event base .",

    "the next step is to determine how many counts of the background contributed into the signal and how many counts from the signal were lost into the low energy background due to the cut .",
    "the trigger rate coming from two photo tubes in one panel in coincidence was 220@xmath1310  hz . as described above , during the experiment the data were taken demanding a quadruple coincidence , which basically means a coincidence between the two panels .",

    "ns the rate can be calculated to@xmath20 or 5158 @xmath21 counts .",
    "the main part of the background can be attributed to random coincidences ( see first cut 0 of table  [ cuts ] ) the tail of the background was assumed to be exponential and extrapolated into the region of interest . the results are listed in table  [ tails ] . the number of muon induced events outside the region of interest was estimated using the result of the monte - carlo simulations ( see fig .",
    "[ mccut ] and table  [ cuts ] ) .",
    "the muon flux can be calculated as follows.@xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total flux of muons through the panel , @xmath24 the measured number of muons , @xmath25 the efficiency of the detector which includes both the physical efficiency of the scintillator and the geometrical efficiency due to the setup of the detector and the angular distribution of the muons , @xmath26 the area covered by the detector ( 2.33  m@xmath27 ) and @xmath28 the run - time of the experiment which was 532800 seconds .",
    "the deviation of the geometrical efficiency from 100% results from the fact that not all muons pass the upper plate vertically . by requiring a coincidence between the upper and the lower panel ,",
    "the measured number of muons will therefore be less than the number of muons passing through the upper panel .",
    "the deviation of the geometrical efficiency was determined by simulating two surfaces with size of the scintillator panels with a separation of 30.5  cm .",
    "the start positions for the muons were randomly chosen on the upper panel .",
    "the azimuthal direction was sampled randomly in an interval between 0 and 2@xmath29 .",
    "the simulations were carried out with a lateral distribution according to equation  [ myaki2 ] .",
    "the depth parameter h was varied over a range of @xmath1310% . with a measured density of ( 2.3@xmath130.2 )  g/@xmath30 @xcite an efficiency of ( 88.5@xmath31)% was obtained .",
    "the vertical flux can be calculated using the approximating formula from @xcite @xmath32 for a depth of 1526 m.w.e .",
    "the vertical flux is @xmath33 .      in the following section other sources of background than discussed in previous sections",
    "are estimated . in order to generate a coincidence pulse with an energy deposition of more than the threshold of 2.0  mev one has to look at particles with higher energy .",

    "@xmath44 during the entire length of experiment of 6.17 days .",
    "several monte - carlo simulations have been carried out to estimate the detection efficiency for neutrons in the existing detector geometry .",
    "the neutrons were randomly started from a sphere of 2  m radius surrounding the two panels into the whole solid angle .",
    "several simulations with neutron energies ranging from 500  kev to 1  tev were performed ( see fig .  [ neff ] ) . according to the experimental settings ,",
    "only such events were counted , where both panels had an energy deposition between 2 and 20  mev .",
    "the most important interaction mechanism is inelastic scattering on hydrogen and carbon in the scintillator material .",
    "therefore the number of events depositing at least 2  mev in each of the panels is reduced by at least 3 orders of magnitude , if the incident neutron energy falls below 4  mev . only neutron captures and other nuclear channels can than produce the required energy . the number of simulated events in fig .",
    "[ neff ] corresponds to 20  neutrons/@xmath45 .",
    "scaling this number to the expected number of neutrons during the experiment and assuming the highest efficiency , gives an upper limit for the number of neutron induced events of @xmath46 .",
    "most of the neutrons will be moderated by the time they reach the detector .",
    "the assumption made above is , therefore , very conservative .",
    "natural radioactivity is present in every geological layer of the earth .",
    "an abundance of uranium and thorium in the salt is able to generate neutrons via ( @xmath47)-reactions and through spontaneous fission .",
    "the u and th contents at wipp have been measured @xcite and are displayed in table  [ uandth ] . with the numbers from @xcite for neutron production via ( @xmath48-reactions of u and th in salt , who lists u@xmath49=5.07  10@xmath50  s@xmath1g@xmath1 for an uranium abundance of 0.3  ppm and th@xmath49=1.51  10@xmath51  s@xmath1g@xmath1 for a thorium abundance of 2.06  ppm in salt , one can estimate the neutron production rate to u@xmath49=8.11  10@xmath52  s@xmath1g@xmath1 for an uranium abundance of 0.048  ppm and th@xmath49=1.83  10@xmath50  s@xmath1g@xmath1 for a thorium abundance of 0.25  ppm in salt ( according to column `` used values '' in table  [ uandth ] ) .",
    "assuming again an attenuation length of 21  cm leads to an upper neutron flux of 1.28  10@xmath53  s@xmath1g@xmath1 .",

    "8  mev and the q - values of the ( n,@xmath54 ) reactions at na or cl is at most -3  mev , a maximum neutron energy of 5  mev can be assumed . with the simulation results from fig .",
    "[ neff ] this leads to a neutron number in the panels of @xmath55 during the measurement .",
    "there are two main sources of gamma background , first the decay of u / th , and second the decay of @xmath56k .",
    "the highest level of gamma background comes from the decay of @xmath56k , which is abundant in the surrounding salt .",
    "the abundance of potassium in salt is 784  @xmath5g / g ( see table  [ uandth ] ) and corresponds to @xmath57  @xmath56k / g .",
    "a 1.46  mev @xmath58-ray will be emitted during the decay , with a probability of 10.7% . with an half - life of @xmath59  y",
    "this results in a decay rate of approximately 2.7  10@xmath60  s@xmath1g@xmath1 . with the macroscopic scattering cross section from @xcite of @xmath61=@xmath62  b in nacl and the assumption of an exponential attenuation law , an attenuation length of 8.4  cm",
    "is computed .",
    "the attenuation length is defined as the length after which the intensity drops by a factor e. with a salt density of 2.3  g/@xmath30 the amount of salt contributing @xmath58-rays can then be estimated to 19.3  g/@xmath45 , which results in a @xmath58-flux of @xmath63  =  5.22  10@xmath64  s@xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "since each gamma can deposit at most 1.46  mev , a triple coincidence during the coincidence window of 100  ns in the detector is required to generate a signal inside the muon - cut region . according to the geant simulations , a @xmath58-ray between 1 and 2 mev emitted from a sphere of 2  m radius around the panels deposits energy with a probability less than 1% in one of the detectors , resulting in a rate of 262  s@xmath1 energy - depositing events .",
    "the resulting rate of triple coincidences ( @xmath65 with @xmath18  =  100  ns and @xmath66  =  262  s@xmath1 ) is 1.80  10@xmath51  s@xmath1 , or 0.1  events during the experiment , hence negligible .",
    "the number of gammas originating from @xmath67 and @xmath68 reactions can be estimated using the above calculated neutron flux .",
    "assuming that only one @xmath58-ray above 5  mev is produced per neutron , the flux is 1.28  10@xmath53  s@xmath1g@xmath1 .",
    "gamma rays with energies up to 10  mev have been simulated in order to estimate the efficiency of the muon panels including the coincidence requirement of at least 2  mev energy deposition per panel .",
    "the geometry and number of particles were the same as described above for the neutrons ( see table  [ nsim ] ) . assuming that the detection efficiency was on average below the simulated efficiency for a 10  mev @xmath58-ray , at most of 32 counts",
    "are expected during the entire run of the experiment .",
    "the raw data have ( 5202@xmath1372 ) counts in the region of interest .",
    "after the correction for electronic noise inside the region of interest ( 40@xmath134 ) events and muon - induced events outside this region ( 62@xmath136 ) events one obtains ( 5224@xmath69 ) counts .",
    "a conservative 10% uncertainty was assumed for each of the corrections , which were then quadratically combined ( see table  [ factors ] ) .",
    "only upper limits for the contribution from neutrons ( 55 ) and @xmath58-rays ( 32 ) have been performed .",
    "the uncertainty due to the detection efficiency is ( @xmath1355 ) events .",
    "since all the uncertainties are independent from each other , a quadratical addition of the different components can be performed .",
    "the final number of muon induced events in the muon panels is therefore ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "as discussed above , the geometrical efficiency , resulting from the fact that not all muons are vertically , has to be taken into account .",
    "the number of muons passing through the detector area is ( @xmath71 ) events .",
    "the uncertainties of both , the surface area of the detector and the running time is well below the 1% level and can therefore be neglected .",
