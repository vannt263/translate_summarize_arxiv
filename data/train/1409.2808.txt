    "however , this limitation of the result ( iii ) is not mentioned in @xcite , and neither @xcite nor @xcite point out that the theorem does not apply to the choices of @xmath50 proposed for the extended floater - hormann interpolants and used in the experiments .",
    "rigorously , our proof applies only to the case @xmath51 .",
    "it suffices as a counterexample to theorem 5.1 , but it is unsatisfactory from a broader practical perspective .",
    "however , we emphasize that , in practice , theorem 5.1 gives a misleading impression regarding the lebesgue constant of extended floater - hormann interpolants for broader classes of parameters .",
    "we do not have a formal theory supporting this claim , but sections [ section_practice ] and [ section_reduced ] and figure [ figure_conjecture ] below present strong experimental evidence of its validity .",
    "this article presents an stability analysis of extended floater - hormann interpolants based on the appropriate interpretation of the lebesgue constant .",
    "formally , when the function @xmath52 which yields the extended function values @xmath50 is linear in @xmath53 , we consider the linear operator @xmath54 \\in c^0[a , b]$ ] given by @xmath55}\\!\\left(t\\right ) } : = { { \\tilde{r}_{d , y}}\\!\\left(t , { \\mathbf{x } } , { \\mathbf{y}}\\right)},\\ ] ] for @xmath56 defined in ( [ defrdy ] ) , and the lebesgue constant can be defined either as the norm of this linear operator with respect to the supremum norm in @xmath57 and @xmath58 $ ] , or as the supremum of the lebesgue function @xmath59}\\!\\left(t\\right)}\\right|}\\ ] ] in @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "these two definitions are equivalent , and lead to a concept which has a fundamental role in theory and in practice , provided that it is interpreted correctly .    by considering the correct lebesgue constant",
    ", we gain a more realistic view of the stability of extended floater - hormann interpolants .",
    "for instance , we learn that the version of these interpolants mentioned in klein and berrut @xcite and klein @xcite should not be used with large @xmath23 .",
    "since the order of approximation of these interpolants is @xmath61 for @xmath62 , this limits their accuracy in practice .",
    "the articles @xcite and @xcite say nothing about the disastrous effect that a large @xmath23 may have on extended interpolants . instead , they emphasize that these interpolants can be used with large @xmath27 .",
    "this is illustrated by figures 6 in @xcite and @xcite , which explore only the case @xmath63 and compare the resulting extended interpolants with usual interpolants with @xmath40 as large as @xmath64 .",
    "if instead of considering @xmath40 as large as 50 in their figure 6 , they had focused on the more modest case @xmath65 , as in their other experiments , then they would have a more realistic argument in favor of extended interpolants .",
    "indeed , for this range of @xmath40 , figures 5 to 10 in @xcite show that extended interpolants are better than usual ones in cases of practical interest .",
    "therefore , extended interpolants have merit and are a relevant topic for research .",
    "however , our experiments in section [ section_instability ] show that there are also cases in which extended interpolants are worse than usual ones , and here we aim at a balanced view of their properties and limitations .",
    "in particular , we discuss the role played by each one of their parameters and the ranges in which they should be used .    in sections",
    "[ section_reduced ] and [ section_lebesgue ] we analyze the lebesgue constants of extended interpolants from a theoretical perspective .",
    "we present an exponential lower bound on the lebesgue constant when @xmath49 .",
    "we also present experimental data showing that the dependency of the lebesgue function on these three parameters is not accurately described by theorem 5.1 in more general settings .",
    "section [ section_backward ] discusses the backward stability of extended floater - hormann interpolants in the general case in which the function @xmath66 that defines @xmath50 is linear in @xmath53 .",
    "we present a simple condition that implies the backward instability of the barycentric formula used to implement extended interpolants in this case , and we show experimentally that this condition for backward instability is satisfied by an extended interpolant mentioned in @xcite .",
    "section [ section_instability ] presents an empirical analysis of the stability of the extended interpolants outlined in berrut and klein @xcite .",
    "we explain that the extrapolation step may lead to numerical instability , and due to this instability the overall error incurred by these interpolants can be much larger than @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is its lebesgue constant and @xmath69 is the machine precision . in order to illustrate this fact , we present the results of experiments in which the accuracy of the extended interpolants is much worse than the accuracy of the usual interpolants .    on the positive side , once we become aware of the problems caused by the extrapolation step , we may consider ways to reduce them .",
    "when evaluating the interpolants for many values of @xmath70 $ ] , it is worth computing the relatively few extrapolated function values in multiple precision .",
    "numerical experiments show that this strategy leads to more accurate extended interpolants .",
    "finally , the appendix considers the difficulties involved in the construction of a general stability theory for extended interpolants .",
    "this appendix is at a more abstract level than the rest of the article : we argue about the arguments one would use to discuss the stability of extended interpolants .",
    "we hope that people interested in an in depth analysis of the stability of these interpolants will appreciate our remarks regarding the difficulties in formulating realistic hypotheses and theorems about this subject .",
    "the lebesgue constant is a fundamental concept in approximation theory .",
    "it is also fundamental in practice , because it measures the sensitivity of the interpolants to perturbations ( or noise ) in the data . in its proper interpretation ,",
    "the lebesgue constant is equivalent to what numerical analysts call _ condition number _ , and use to evaluate the numerical stability of algorithms .",
    "this section shows that that rounding errors and noisy data have devastating effects on interpolants for which theorems in @xcite and @xcite claim that the lebesgue constant is small .",
    "therefore , such claims may lead readers to believe that these interpolants are much less affected by noise and rounding errors than they really are .",
    "figure [ figure_practice ] considers the approximation of @xmath71 for @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "the plot on the left of figure [ figure_practice ] shows that by implementing the extrapolation procedure proposed in @xcite and @xcite with the usual ieee 754 double precision arithmetic we may have numerical errors of order @xmath73 in circumstances in which theorem 5.1 yields a bound smaller than @xmath74 on the constant which berrut and klein call by lebesgue s name .",
    "these errors are several orders of magnitude larger than the ones reported in @xcite and @xcite for the same kind of extended interpolant , because we do not restrict ourselves to the same small values of @xmath23 as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the plot on the right of figure [ figure_practice ] illustrates the sensitivity of extended interpolants to noise in the function values .",
    "it was obtained by adding random values of order @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "the effects of rounding errors in this plot are negligible because we used the high precision arithmetic provided by the mpfr library @xcite , with a mantissa of 640 bits .",
    "the experiment on the right indicates that in this case the condition number is about @xmath77 , and not @xmath74 as suggested by theorem 5.1 of berrut and klein @xcite .",
    "figure [ figure_practice ] raises an interesting question : why does the plot on the left display errors of order @xmath73 while the plot on the right shows errors of order one ?",
    "this question is intriguing because the ieee 754 s double precision machine epsilon is of order @xmath78 and is much smaller than the @xmath79 perturbations used to generate the plot on the right . as we explain in the rest of the article",
    ", the answer to this question lies in the instabilities in the extrapolation process proposed by klein @xcite and this is one more reason why , in practice , the logarithmic bound presented in @xcite and @xcite underestimates the effects of noise and rounding errors .",
    "in this section we show how to write extended interpolants in barycentric form and introduce another way to describe them , which we call _ reduced form_. this form is numerically unstable and we do not advocate its use in practice .",
    "its purpose is to help us to deduce an expression for the lebesgue function of extended interpolants .",
    "the lebesgue function measures the sensitivity of the output of the complete interpolation process to perturbations in its input , and we emphasize that the input to the interpolation process are the original function values @xmath80 ; not the extrapolated function values @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , we can not ignore how changes in @xmath53 affect @xmath82 as suggested by equation ( 3.2 ) in @xcite .",

    "this appendix illustrates the difficulties in building a general and realistic stability theory for extended interpolants , a theory which would take into account the errors introduced by the current implementations of floating point arithmetic .",
    "we explain that the stability of extended interpolants is sensitive to the way we implement the extrapolation step , and that the accuracy of this step depends on the cancellation of the rounding errors .",
    "in fact , the errors incurred by extended interpolants can be enormous when we use the extrapolation formula proposed in @xcite and @xcite , and compute @xmath50 according to the following procedure :    * if @xmath100 is even , set the rounding mode upward and evaluate @xmath81 as in ( [ ytila])([ytilc ] ) . *",

    "their purpose is to help us understand what can be proved about the numerical stability of extended interpolants , so that we do not try to prove something that can not be proved .",
    "it is unlikely that @xmath50 will be evaluated as in the steps ( a ) and ( b ) when rounding to nearest . in this mode , there is a 50% chance of rounding up in each flop and , under the questionable hypothesis of independence of the rounding errors , there would be a minuscule probability of @xmath333 of having all the intermediate results in the evaluation of @xmath50 rounded up when rounding to nearest .",
    "since the set of floating point numbers is finite , such a coincidence may be impossible .",
    "however , our experiments indicate that it is difficult to build a realistic theory on the effects of rounding errors on extended interpolants , because the rounding errors induced by our changes of rounding modes would be allowed by usual models of floating point arithmetic , with @xmath69 replaced by @xmath334 . more precisely",
    ": when evaluating @xmath50 , with our choices of rounding modes , we monitored the relative errors @xmath335 for each operation we performed , and found all of them to be smaller than @xmath336 .    in other words , a stability theory for extended interpolants based on the usual models of floating point arithmetic would need to cover the changes of rounding modes in steps ( a ) and ( b ) above and , as a result , its predictions would be too pessimistic .",
    "therefore , a realistic stability theory for extended interpolants will require additional hypothesis regarding the floating point arithmetic .",
    "by contrast , under the usual models of floating point arithmetic @xcite , we already have realistic theories bounding the rounding errors in terms of @xmath69 , @xmath32 and the lebesgue constant for other barycentric interpolation schemes , as in @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
