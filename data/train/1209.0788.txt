    "the gap structure in the fe - based superconductors and its possible unconventional nature is still a key issue in the field four years after their discovery . in most compounds ,",
    "the pairing is believed to be of the so - called @xmath1 type , for which the order parameter changes sign between the electron - like and the hole - like fermi surfaces  @xcite .",
    "some experimental results are consistent with this prediction@xcite .",
    "however , a major difficulty in distinguishing such an unconventional pairing state from a trivial @xmath0-wave gap is that both states are nodeless and transform trivially under all the symmetry operations of the material s point group . as the experimental probes that are usually used to distinguish various gap structures , such as phase - sensitive probes , are not fermi pocket specific , an unambiguous evidence of the unconventional @xmath1 pairing remains evasive .",
    "one route to accessing phase information using a phase - insensitive probe would be through vortex bound states , as a vortex introduces a spatial texture to the superconducting order parameter .",
    "advancements in in - field scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) have enabled the study of vortex bound states .",
    "indeed , a recent sts experiment on lifeas under a magnetic field has shown an intriguing energy dependence in the spatial distribution of the local density of states ( ldos ) near a vortex@xcite .",
    "the remaining question is whether the observed ldos distribution near vortex can be instrumental in selecting one of the proposed gap structures : @xmath1-wave @xcite , @xmath2-wave @xcite , and ( spin - triplet ) @xmath3-wave @xcite . at zero bias ,",
    "the ldos shows a four - fold star shape with high - intensity ` rays ' along the fe - as direction .",
    "similar features in nbse@xmath4  @xcite were interpreted as a sign of gap minima along this direction . however , a quasi - classical analysis by wang _ _ et al.__@xcite pointed out that the normal - state band structure of lifeas ",
    "namely a highly anisotropic hole pocket around the @xmath5 point  could be producing these rays irrespective of gap structure .",
    "by contrast , little attention has been given to the high energy ldos distribution observed in ref .",
    "@xcite : hot spots appearing at the intersection of split rays .    motivated by these observations , we present a study of the near - vortex electronic structure and signatures of unconventional pairing therein within the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) framework . by ( non - self - consistently ) imposing a gap structure and solving the bdg hamiltonian ,",
    "we first show that the isotropic @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave pairing result in different spatial distributions of the ldos at energies approaching the gap value .",
    "in particular , we find @xmath1-wave pairing to yield the observed hot spots",
    ". then we solve the bdg equations self - consistently , and based on our results propose detecting the spatial distribution of the gap around a vortex for a more direct evidence of unconventional @xmath1-wave pairing .",
    "a vortex not only suppresses the order - parameter amplitude at its core and introduces a singular point in space around which the phase of the order parameter winds , but it also induces a secondary order parameter in its vicinity @xcite . due to the induced secondary order parameter near the vortex , the gap recovery should show a strong angular dependence .",
    "detection of such anisotropy will be an unambiguous evidence of unconventional pairing .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sections 2 and 3 , we introduce the microscopic model and describe the bogoliubov - de gennes calculations , respectively . in section 4",
    ", we present the results of the bdg calculations and discuss them within ginzburg - landau theory . in section 5 , we summarize our findings and remark on future directions . throughout the paper we focus on the large hole pocket and",
    "study the single band problem .",
    "however , we also present results from non - self - consistent bdg calculations on a five - band model in section 4 , which show good agreement with observations from single - band model calculations in the energy range of our interest .",

    "we describe lifeas in the superconducting state with the ( mean - field ) bdg hamiltonian @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is a nambu spinor , and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) annihilates ( creates ) an electron at lattice site @xmath12 with spin @xmath0 within a single - band model for the large hole pocket around the @xmath5 point : the so - called @xmath7 band",
    ". however , eq .   can easily be generalized for a multi - band model . in this paper , we focus on the single - band model for the most part since the superconducting gap is the smallest on the @xmath7 band@xcite and hence we expect low energy physics to be dominated by this band . moreover , this band mainly stems from the ( in - plane ) @xmath6 orbitals , and thus shows little @xmath13 dependence@xcite .",
    "it is therefore a natural choice for lifeas .",
    "note that previous bdg calculations on different fe - pnictides focused on two - band models for the @xmath14 / @xmath15 orbitals @xcite .",
    "our choice of the hopping matrix @xmath16 is guided by the experimental observations on the @xmath7 pocket@xcite to be @xmath17ev for nearest - neighbor hopping , @xmath18ev for next - nearest - neighbor hopping , and @xmath19ev for the chemical potential .",
    "figure [ fig : fs](a ) shows the resulting fermi surface in solid red line .",
    "though we stay within this single - band model for the self - consistent bdg studies , we have also used a five - band model for the non - self - consistent calculation with tight - binding parameters from ref .",

    "restricting the interaction @xmath26 to a specific form constrains the momentum structure of the gap function , since @xmath27 only if @xmath28 . in the uniform case ,",
    "an on - site attraction @xmath29 leads to a spin - singlet @xmath0-wave gap @xmath30 , while a next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) attraction @xmath31 allows for the singlet gap functions of @xmath1 form , @xmath32 , and @xmath6 form , @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fs](b ) shows sketches of these gap functions .",
    "we restrict our calculations in the following to these ` pure ' gap structures . even though the true gap function is a ( symmetry - allowed ) mixture of such gap functions , the dominant channel ( on - site or nnn interactions ) will determine whether an @xmath1- or an @xmath2-wave gap is realized in the presence of the electron pockets .    for the non - self - consistent bdg study , the vortex will be imposed through the gap - function configuration of @xmath34 where the vector @xmath35 points to the midpoint of sites @xmath12 and @xmath24 , and @xmath36 is its azimuthal angle measured from the fe - fe direction .",
    "this corresponds to a single vortex located at the origin suppressing locally the order - parameter amplitude .",
    "in addition , the order - parameter phase winds around the vortex core .    for the self - consistent bdg study , we induce the vortices by applying a magnetic field @xmath37 . assuming minimal coupling between an electron and the field , the hopping between sites @xmath12 and @xmath24 acquires a peierls phase @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the magnetic fluxoid and @xmath40 is the vector pointing to the site @xmath12 .",

    "note that for the uniform case , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 as defined above .",
    "in this section , we elaborate on our two approaches to solve the bdg equations and obtain the ldos near a vortex . for both , diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath52 in eq .   for a system of size",
    "@xmath53 is computationally the most expensive part .      for the non - self - consistent calculation",
    ", we impose a gap function in the form given by eq .   and find the low lying eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath52 using the lanczos algorithm .",

    "we proceed iteratively until self - consistency is achieved . in diagonalizing @xmath52",
    ", we can no longer make use of the crystal momentum basis to simplify the problem since the peierls phase factor prevents the kinetic part of the hamiltonian from commuting with the ordinary lattice translation operator @xmath59",
    ". however , the kinetic part commutes with the magnetic translation operator @xmath60 for a magnetic lattice vector @xmath61 whose unit cell contains two magnetic fluxoids",
    ".    the pairing term in general does not commute with @xmath62 .",
    "nevertheless , when vortices form a lattice , @xmath62 commutes with the pairing term when @xmath63 is a vector of a vortex sublattice containing every other vortex .",
    "since we focus on the electronic structure near a single vortex , we expect the shape of the vortex lattice to have little influence on our results .",
    "therefore , we make an arbitrary choice for its primitive vectors to be @xmath64 and @xmath65 , such that @xmath63 forms a rectangular lattice @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "we can interpret the vortex bound states in this non - self - consistent bdg calculation as bound states in a potential well given by eq .",
    ", where only states around the normal - state fermi surface constitute the bound states .",
    "there are then two sources of anisotropy : anisotropic , quasi - one - dimensional low - energy properties of the normal state , and an anisotropic gap , both defined in the momentum space .",

    "while the isotropic @xmath0-wave gap is analogous to a potential that is independent of momentum , the anisotropic gap is one for which different states around the fermi surface experience different potentials depending on their momenta . with the gap function of @xmath1 form , the quasi - one - dimensional portion of the fermi surface experiences a stronger trap potential , leading to a suppression of its contribution to the bound - state wave function . as a result",

    "the ldos at the core of the vortex for the on - site pairing shown in fig  [ fig : nonsc_ldos](d ) exhibits particle - hole asymmetry with the highest peak at negative energy .",
    "such asymmetry appears in the so - called ` quantum - limit ' vortex bound state@xcite , whose highest ldos peak is at energy @xmath88 above(below ) the fermi energy for an electron(hole)-like band , where @xmath89 is the energy difference between the fermi energy and the bottom(top ) of the band .",
    "the energy of the ldos peak being @xmath90 below the fermi energy is expected given @xmath91 and @xmath92 within our input bandstructure .",
    "though similar particle - hole asymmetry has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : nonsc_ldos](h ) ] the energy at which the peak was observed suggests that other hole pockets with larger gap values may be responsible .",
    "now , we check whether the single - band model is sufficient to describe vortex bound states within the energy range of interest . a simple insight can be gained by treating each band independently and estimating the energy of its lowest bound state to be @xmath93 following caroli _ _ et al.__@xcite for the gap size @xmath94 and the fermi energy @xmath89 specific to each band .",
    "using measured fermi energies and gap parameters@xcite , we estimate the energies of the lowest bound states of the @xmath7 pocket and the electron pockets to be of the same order .",
    "the lowest bound state energies of the two smaller hole pockets are an order of magnitude larger .",
    "this rough estimate implies that the ldos within the energy below @xmath95 should be dominated by bound states coming from the @xmath7 band and those coming from the two electron bands .",
    "if indeed each bound state comes from a single band , we expect to find bound states with ldos distribution resembling what we predicted in section 4.1 .    for concreteness",

    "different pairing structures , however , lead to qualitatively different ldos distributions at higher energies : while the isotropic @xmath0-wave shows a square - like feature of roughly equal intensity , four ` hot spots ' develop in the case of an ( anisotropic ) @xmath86-wave gap .",
    "indeed , our results for the latter case qualitatively agree with recent experiments@xcite .    from the self - consistent treatment",
    "we have further found a difference in the recovery of the order parameter away from the vortex core : a pronounced angular dependence of the @xmath86-wave gap compared to isotropic behavior for the @xmath0-wave gap . employing a ginzburg - landau analysis , we have explained this difference through admixing of a secondary order parameter supported by the nnn interaction .",
    "note that such intermixing is negligible for an @xmath0-wave pairing with a dominant on - site pairing interaction , as no other pairing instabilities are nearby .",
    "for the nnn interaction , however , @xmath1- and @xmath6-wave instabilities have comparable transition temperatures .",
    "detection of the anisotropy or even the secondary order parameter would be a strong proof of the unconventional nature of the pairing .    in this work , we focused on the @xmath7 band with interest in low energy properties , as this is the band with the smallest gap@xcite . hence ,",
    "for features at energies less than the gap scale , we expect our calculation to capture salient features of in - field sts experiments . the comparison between the calculated ldos for the single- and the five - band models and the results in ref .",
    "@xcite supports this conjecture .",
    "in closing we note that our calculation captures friedel - like oscillations , frequently referred to as quasi - particle interference ( qpi ) , due to vortices .",
    "qpi in the presence of vortices was successfully used to access phase information with sts in cuprates@xcite .",
    "recent in - field qpi experiments on fese have been interpreted to be consistent with an @xmath1 scenario when a vortex is treated as a magnetic scatterer for bdg quasiparticles@xcite . however , a vortex is at once a point of gap suppression , a point with magnetic flux , and a point around which the order - parameter phase winds . while we treated vortices faithfully in the self - consistent calculation",
    ", we could not investigate effects of inter - pocket sign change as we only considered one pocket .",
    "an extension of the present work with the full band structure would be necessary to work out what to expect for different order - parameter possibilities , especially how the phase difference between different pockets affects in - field qpi .",
