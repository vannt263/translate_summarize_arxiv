    "a major difference between the phase behavior of one - component fluids and binary mixtures is that , even if one considers just simple systems with a spherically symmetric , lennard - jones ( lj ) like interaction profile , the qualitative features of the phase diagram of mixtures depend very sensitively on the parameters of the microscopic potential .",
    "if the interaction between a particle of species @xmath8 and a particle of species @xmath9 is modeled as the sum of a hard - core repulsion and a longer - ranged attractive tail , the relevant parameters are the hard - sphere diameters @xmath10 and the strengths @xmath0 of the attractive contributions , @xmath1 .",
    "this parameter space is drastically reduced by focusing on a particular class of systems , generally referred to as _ symmetric mixtures _ , such that @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "since the quantities @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be included into the definition of the temperature @xmath15 and number densities @xmath16 by introducing standard reduced units @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 being the boltzmann constant , it follows that the only parameter affecting the phase diagram is the ratio of the interaction strengths between unlike and like species @xmath20 .    clearly , symmetric mixtures appear quite artificial when considered as a model of real binary fluids .",
    "in fact , some of the features of their phase behavior hinge on the invariance with respect to the exchange of the two species , and are not found in the phase diagram of real mixtures . as has already been observed  @xcite , symmetric mixtures are better seen as a model for a one - component fluid , whose particles have been endowed with a two - state , spin - like variable in addition to their translational degrees of freedom , so that their mutual interaction depends both on their relative position and on their `` internal '' state , namely whether the interacting particles belong to the same species or not . as such ,",
    "this model mixture is closely related to other models of dipolar  @xcite and magnetic  @xcite fluids , especially ising - spin fluids  @xcite . in these systems , the phase behavior results from the interplay between the liquid - vapor phase separation and the additional transition , e.g. para - ferromagnetic , associated to the spin - like degrees of freedom . in symmetric mixtures ,",
    "the latter corresponds to the mixing - demixing transition .    because of the relative simplicity of this model compared to a generic binary mixture and of the possibility of generating the whole spectrum of phase diagrams by acting on just one parameter",
    ", symmetric mixtures have been widely studied both by mean - field theory  @xcite and by numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "a situation which has been given special attention is that of equal species concentration @xmath21 . in this case ,",
    "accurate numerical simulations  @xcite have qualitatively confirmed the mean - field scenario for the phase diagram as the parameter @xmath4 is varied in the interval @xmath5 .",
    "this will be considered in detail in secs .",
    "[ sec : results1 ] , [ sec : results2 ] .",
    "here we just recall that the mean - field phase diagram at equal species concentration presents both a first - order coexistence boundary which separates a low - density fluid from a high - density one , and a line ( the so - called @xmath22-line ) of mixing - demixing critical points . beyond the @xmath22-line ,",
    "the fluid actually consists of two demixed fluids in equal amounts , one at a certain concentration @xmath23 , and the other at concentration @xmath24 , so that the overall concentration of the two species remains the same . for large enough @xmath4 ( @xmath25 with @xmath26 according to the mean - field result  @xcite )",
    "the coexistence curve ends into a liquid - vapor critical point , while the @xmath22-line intersects the coexistence curve at a point of first - order transition , thereby terminating into a critical endpoint . at small @xmath4 ( @xmath27 with @xmath28 in mean field  @xcite ) , on the other hand , the point at which the coexistence curve meets the @xmath22-line coincides with its critical point .",
    "the latter is then referred to as a tricritical point , since on approaching this point from low temperatures , one observes the simultaneous coalescence of three phases , namely the low - density vapor and the two demixed high - density fluids . finally , in a narrow interval of @xmath4 values",
    "@xmath29 intermediate between those corresponding to the two topologies described above , one has the occurrence of both a liquid - vapor critical point and a tricritical point . despite the qualitative agreement between the mean - field scenario and the simulation results ,",
    "there are still several points that deserve further investigation .",
    "first , mean - field theory and simulations show considerable quantitative discrepancies , which concern both the position of the critical loci and the values of @xmath4 at which the changes in the topology of the phase diagram occur .",
    "this is in itself not surprising , as mean - field theory can not be expected to be quantitatively very accurate .",
    "therefore , one would like to go beyond it by means of a theoretical treatment which includes fluctuations in the order parameter of the transition , be it of the liquid - vapor or mixing - demixing kind",
    ". two relevant issues in this respect are whether the mean - field scenario is qualitatively recovered even after fluctuations have been taken into account , and which is the extent of the quantitative changes involved .",
    "moreover , the case of equal species concentration corresponds just to a certain plane , albeit undoubtedly of special interest , of the space of thermodynamic states .",
    "simulation studies of the phase diagram have indeed been performed also at fixed density @xmath30 and variable concentration @xmath31  @xcite , but mapping the phase diagram in the whole thermodynamic space for different values of the parameter @xmath4 would require an exhorbitant number of simulation runs , and therefore hardly appears as a viable strategy in view of the computer time required .",
    "it is then tempting to resort to theory in order to explore the phase diagram at general density and concentration and find out how it changes by changing @xmath4 , so as to see what the phase diagrams corresponding to the three regimes outlined above look like , as one moves away from the @xmath32 plane .",
    "we aim to address these topics in the present work by means of the hierarchical reference theory ( hrt ) of binary fluids .",
    "this theory has already been successfully applied to the description of the critical behavior  @xcite , crossover phenomena  @xcite , and phase diagram  @xcite of simple fluid mixtures .",
    "few results for the phase behavior of symmetric mixtures have also been reported  @xcite , but a systematic investigation of this system by hrt has not been undertaken yet . in our opinion , hrt is especially well suited for such a study , with particular regard for the tasks stated above . in fact , the aim of this approach is determining how the helmholtz free energy of the mixture is affected by the introduction of density and concentration fluctuations .",
    "this is achieved via a renormalization - group ( rg ) like procedure , where the long - wavelength fourier components of the microscopic interaction are gradually introduced into the hamiltonian of the mixture .",
    "any intermediate stage of this process , such that only fourier components with wavevectors exceeding a certain cutoff @xmath33 have been taken into account , physically corresponds to suppressing fluctuations on a lengthscale @xmath34 .",
    "long - range fluctuations are recovered in the limit @xmath35 , when the free energy of the fully interacting system is obtained , while the mean - field free energy enters as the initial condition at @xmath36 .",
    "the main advantage of hrt over other liquid - state theories is that it embodies several features of the rg description of critical phenomena in a treatment based on the microscopic hamiltonian of the fluid .",
    "these include scaling , non - trivial critical exponents , and the correspondence between universality classes and different fixed points of the rg flow  @xcite .",
    "a fact of particular relevance for the investigation pursued here is that the inclusion of long - range fluctuations has the effect of preserving the correct convexity of the free energy in the whole thermodynamic space .",
    "whenever phase coexistence occurs , one does not find any domain of instability as in the mean - field approximation , and the conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium between the phases at coexistence are enforced by the theory itself . at each given temperature , the coexistence region is then immediately recovered as the locus in the density - concentration plane where the chemical potential of each component is constant along the lines of fixed pressure , with no need of imposing this condition _ a posteriori _ by a maxwell construction .",
    "for binary mixtures , the latter proves to be quite cumbersome already at the mean - field level , and is much more so for more sophisticated integral - equation theories , in which the occurrence of phase separation generally entails the presence of some forbidden domain , where the theory can not be solved at all .",
    "therefore , the ability of straightforwardly mapping the phase diagram is a valuable asset of hrt .",
    "this is especially true in the present case where the topology of the phase diagram is very sensitive to changes in @xmath4 , while at the same time , as will be seen in the following , the features that allow one to discriminate between different topologies are often detectable only in a narrow window of the thermodynamic space .",
    "because of the lack of a solution defined for every @xmath37 state , pinpointing all these features by conventional integral - equation theories would undoubtedly prove extremely difficult , perhaps even impossible .    in this work we have considered symmetric mixtures of additive hard spheres interacting via an attractive yukawa tail potential @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the interparticle distance and @xmath40 is the inverse range of the interaction , which has been fixed to the value @xmath41 for both like and unlike species .",
    "this hard - core yukawa ( hcy ) form has been preferred to the square - well potential used in ref .",
    "the latter lends itself well to simulation , but the very slowly decaying behavior of its fourier transform makes it somewhat tedious to use in hrt .",
    "the hcy potential has already been adopted in a number of studies of symmetric mixtures based on the mean spherical approximation ( msa )  @xcite , the optimized random phase approximation ( orpa )  @xcite , and the self - consistent ornstein - zernike approximation ( scoza )  @xcite , all of which yielded for the phase diagram at equimolar concentration the same behavior found in mean - field theory .",
    "the scenario that comes out of our investigation by hrt agrees qualitatively with the mean - field one in predicting that , as @xmath4 is increased , the phase diagram at equimolar concentration exhibits first a tricritical point , and subsequentely both a tricritical and a liquid - vapor critical point .",
    "however , we did not find any clear evidence of the occurrence of the mixing - demixing critical endpoint given by mean - field theory as @xmath4 approaches @xmath6 , at least up to @xmath7 , above which further investigation is hindered by the finite resolution of the density grid used in our numerical calculation . besides the scenario sketched above at equal species concentration , other interesting features of the phase diagram emerge as we move off the @xmath32 axis .",
    "for instance , the intermediate regime where both a critical and a tricritical point are found for @xmath32 is marked in the @xmath30-@xmath31 plane by a coexistence region which in a certain temperature interval contains a `` hole '' or `` island '' of homogeneous , mixed fluid .",
    "double critical points and , for a certain value of @xmath4 , tricritical points are also observed for unequal species concentration .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : the hrt for a binary fluid is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] .",
    "mean - field theory is recovered within this approach as a zeroth - order approximation , and the mean - field results for the critical lines of a symmetric mixture as the parameter @xmath4 is varied in the interval @xmath5 are shown in sec .",

    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our findings and draw our conclusions .",
    "here we briefly review the hrt approach for a binary fluid .",
    "a more detailed derivation can be found in previous works  @xcite .",
    "we consider a model mixture consisting of particles of two species interacting via a two - body spherically symmetric potential @xmath42 , where the indices @xmath8 , @xmath9 label the particle species .",
    "the derivations presented in this section do not hinge on the fact that one is dealing with a symmetric system such that @xmath43 , so they are equally valid for non - symmetric systems .",
    "we assume that @xmath42 can be split as the sum of a singular contribution @xmath44 which accounts for the short - range repulsion between the particles , and a longer - ranged , smooth attractive tail @xmath45 which may induce fluid - fluid phase separation .",
    "the properties of the mixture interacting via the repulsive potential @xmath44 alone are considered as known , so that it acts as a `` reference '' or unperturbed system . for a hard - core plus tail potential ,",
    "the natural choice for the reference system is just a binary mixture of additive hard spheres , which can be described by the mansoori - carnahan - starling - leland equation of state  @xcite and the corresponding verlet - weis parameterization for the two - body correlations  @xcite .",
    "we remark that here we will not be concerned with a possible demixing transition occurring in the hard - sphere mixture , since such a transition may come along only as a consequence of depletion interactions when the particles differ widely in size . in the present case of equisized particles ,",
    "the reference system reduces to a one - component hard - sphere fluid , and all the fluid - fluid transitions displayed by the system are necessarily due to the attractive perturbation @xmath45 .",
    "the hrt differs from the conventional liquid - state approaches in the way this perturbation is dealt with . in order to accurately describe the long - range fluctuations that are important in criticality and phase separation ,",
    "the attractive part of the interaction is switched on gradually by introducing a @xmath33-_system _ with a modified interaction @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is defined in such a way that its fourier transform @xmath48 coincides with that of the original attractive potential @xmath49 for @xmath50 , and vanishes for @xmath51 .",
    "inspection of the diagrammatic series of the helmholtz free energy of the mixture in terms of the perturbation @xmath45 and the correlation functions of the reference system shows that introducing such an infra - red cutoff in the interaction is physically equivalent to inhibiting fluctuations with characteristic lengths @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath33 is made evolve from @xmath36 , the @xmath33-systems evolve from the reference system by acquiring fluctuations of longer and longer wavelengths .",
    "the fully interacting system is recovered as the @xmath35 limit of such a process . only in this limit",
    "true long - range correlations are allowed to develop in the fluid .",

    "we recall that the direct correlation function is related to the structure factor of the fluid by the ornstein - zernike relation . if we denote by @xmath56 the @xmath57 symmetric matrix with elements @xmath55 , for a binary mixture this relation reads @xmath58_{ij}= -\\sqrt{\\rho_{i}\\rho_{j}}\\ , s^{q}_{ij}(k ) \\",

    "one has @xmath72 , and @xmath62 and @xmath71 are nothing but the mean - field free energy and the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) direct correlation function in the presence of the full perturbing potential @xmath70 .",
    "these play the role of the initial conditions of the evolution equation  ( [ hrt ] ) , which then describes how the mean - field estimate for the free energy is affected by the inclusion of fluctuations .",
    "this equation is manifestly not closed , since the evolution of the free energy @xmath62 is related to the matrix of the direct correlation function @xmath63 , which is itself unknown .",
    "in fact , eq .  ( [ hrt ] ) is just the first equation of an infinite hierarchy for the direct correlation functions of increasing order : for instance , the evolution of @xmath63 is related to the @xmath73- and @xmath74-body direct correlation functions in fourier space  @xcite .",
    "a point of crucial importance in order to implement a viable hrt scheme consists then in supplementing eq .",
    "( [ hrt ] ) with some closure relation involving @xmath63 . here , as well as in the previous applications of hrt",
    ", we have not resorted to the higher - order equations of the hierarchy .",
    "instead , we have adopted for @xmath63 an approximate form inspired by standard perturbative liquid - state theories : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the fourier transform of the partial direct correlation function of the hard - sphere reference system , which has been represented by the above - mentioned verlet - weis parameterization .",
    "the functional form of eq .",
    "( [ closure ] ) for the direct correlation function is similar to that of the widely used rpa , which is recovered for @xmath77 .",
    "in particular , both of them rely on the ornstein - zernike _ ansatz _ , i.e. , the direct correlation function has always the same range as the potential , so that @xmath78 is always analytic in @xmath79 , including at the critical points of the system , where the real direct correlation function is instead expected to be non - analytic for @xmath35 .",
    "however , unlike in the rpa , the amplitude @xmath80 of the perturbation is regarded as an unknown quantity , to be determined in such a way that each @xmath33-system satisfies the compressibility sum rule . in a one - component fluid",
    ", this relates the isothermal compressibility to the zero - wavevector value of the structure factor , or equivalently of the direct correlation function in momentum space .",

    "this allows us to take advantage of finite - difference schemes especially devised for equations of such a _ quasi - linear _ form , which combine robustness with a moderate computational cost  @xcite .",

    "since the interaction between unlike particles is weaker than that between like particles , the internal energy will tend to promote demixing between the two species . for high enough density ,",
    "this increase in the absolute value of the internal energy may overcome the loss in entropy implied by the demixing , and a mixing - demixing transition may appear . therefore , both liquid - vapor and mixing - demixing critical lines are expected . as the unlike - to - like interaction ratio @xmath4",

    "@xcite on the basis of modified hypernetted chain ( mhnc ) calculations on a symmetric lj mixture , while the simulations performed in ref .",
    "@xcite on a square - well system supported the existence of a critical endpoint at high enough @xmath4 . some calculations that we previously performed on a hard - sphere lj mixture using a @xmath193 density - concentration grid also suggested that for @xmath7 the phase diagram of the system presents a critical endpoint .",
    "however , the present results for a hard - core yukawa potential shown in figs .  [ fig:5a ] , [ fig:5b ] indicate that for @xmath7 , the mixture most likely does not have a critical endpoint : in fact , in a certain narrow temperature range the coexistence region in the @xmath30-@xmath31 plane still encloses a domain of one - phase fluid with concentration varying in a small interval around @xmath32 . since the inverse range @xmath41 of the yukawa potential considered here gives a fair representation of the lj interaction  @xcite , the difference between this behavior and that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite most probably does not depend on some intrinsic difference between the two interactions , but just on the fact that the higher resolution entailed by the @xmath194 grid used in this work allows one to study the contact between the low- and high - density coexistence regions with better accuracy than in ref .",
    "@xcite , thereby uncovering the presence of a small one - phase domain .",
    "we should observe that the case @xmath7 actually lies at the limit of resolution even for the larger grid employed here : the homogeneous domain inside the coexistence region in the @xmath30-@xmath31 plane extends only one gridpoint in the @xmath30-direction , while the phase diagram in the @xmath149-@xmath150 plane does not present any of the features associated with the occurrence of such a domain on the scale of the figure , so that it can not be clearly distinguished from the kind of diagram one would expect in the presence of a critical endpoint .",
    "in particular , there is no sign of the bifurcation of the high - density coexistence region in the @xmath149-@xmath150 plane that we expect if the low- and high - density regions have to meet at two points of non - equimolar concentration according to the scenario of fig .",
    "[ fig:3b ] .",
    "this most probably depends on the fact that , for the relatively high value of @xmath4 considered here , the densities of the mixed and demixed liquids at coexistence are so close , that their difference is comparable to the mesh size . as a consequence , the differences in the pressures and chemical potentials of neighboring but non - coexisting points will also become comparable to the numerical errors .",
    "a little numerical noise in the @xmath149-@xmath150 plane due to the finite mesh used in the calculation is in fact always present , as shown by close inspection of the relevant figures , but only at high @xmath4 does this become a hindrance for a clear description of the phase behavior .",
    "we did not pursue any investigation for @xmath195 , because _ a fortiori _ in such a regime the resolution allowed by the grid used here would not enable us to discriminate between the occurrence of a critical endpoint , or an extremely small region of homogeneous fluid that undergoes a first - order demixing transition on slightly increasing the density .",
    "therefore , we are not in a position to say whether a critical endpoint at @xmath32 will eventually appear near @xmath143 , or instead a very weak first - order transition will survive up to @xmath143 .",
    "another issue that is difficult to elucidate within the resolution of the present calculation concerns the fate of the twigs discussed before in connection with the phase diagram topology of figs .",
    "[ fig:3a ] , [ fig:3b ] .",
    "as noted above , even at temperatures at which the low - density coexistence regions that originate from the pure species have coalesced into one connected domain , the latter can still show two symmetric critical points . when this is the case , the low - density coexistence region in the @xmath149-@xmath150 plane presents two small twigs , each of them ending at a critical point .",
    "these twigs could either disappear at high enough @xmath4 , or persist for @xmath4 arbitrarily close to @xmath6 . if a critical endpoint at @xmath32 never appears and the topology of the critical lines in the @xmath30-@xmath31 plane is that of fig .",
    "[ fig : mf4 ] until @xmath4 gets equal to unity , the latter case corresponds to a situation where the low- and high - density coexistence regions will always meet at two double critical points . as discussed above , mean - field theory indeed gives two double critical points located along the fork - shaped line , but for @xmath4 close to @xmath6 they are certainly metastable since they correspond to negative pressure . if instead the twigs disappear before @xmath4 reaches @xmath6 , there will be a value of @xmath4 above which the critical points of the high - density coexistence region meet the low - density region at two points of first - order coexistence . as a consequence ,",
    "the contact takes place at two critical endpoints with concentrations symmetric with respect to @xmath32 rather than at two double critical points .",
    "this is the situation considered in ref .",
    "in such a case the critical lines in the @xmath30-@xmath31 plane have still the same topology as in fig .  [",
    "fig : mf4 ] , except that the temperature minima along the fork - shaped line have now to coincide with the tips of the fork , which correspond to the two endpoints .",
    "it can also be worthwhile observing that in principle the twigs are not incompatible with a critical endpoint at equimolar concentration .",
    "in fact , this could even give rise to a scenario where the presence of the endpoint is consistent with the high- and low - density coexistence regions meeting at non - equimolar concentration .",
    "specifically , if the critical points located at the ends of the twigs meet the high - density coexistence region at two symmetric critical endpoints with @xmath157 , nothing prevents the point at equimolar concentration of this region from remaining critical , until it also meets the low - density region at a critical endpoint .",
    "we remark that such a possibility hinges on the presence of the twigs and the related critical points on the low - density coexistence region . in the converse situation",
    "where the critical endpoints at @xmath157 result from the contact between two points of first - order coexistence on the low - density domain and two critical points on the high - density one , the requirement that the point at @xmath32 be critical is untenable , as pointed out in ref .",
    "the scenario just depicted is somewhat suggestive , as it could account for both the presence of a critical endpoint at @xmath32 above a certain value of @xmath4 reported in simulation studies  @xcite , and the failure to observe the low- and high - density coexistence regions coalescing at @xmath32 found in the present investigation as well as in  @xcite .",
    "however , we must point out that at the present stage we do not have any solid evidence that this possibility does actually occur , so that we must regard it as a purely speculative conjecture .",
    "we have used the hrt to perform an investigation of the phase diagram of symmetric binary mixtures as a function of the unlike - to - like interaction ratio @xmath4 . the microscopic interaction adopted consisted of a hard - core repulsion plus an attractive yukawa tail potential with inverse range @xmath41 . such a potential has been used many times in liquid - state theory to describe a simple lj - like fluid . for each value of @xmath4",
    "considered , results for the coexistence regions were obtained on the whole density - concentration plane at several temperatures .",
    "the resulting phase portrait was related both to the different topologies of the mean - field critical lines that come along as @xmath4 is varied in the interval @xmath5 , and to the behavior predicted by mean - field theory and simulation results  @xcite for a certain special class of the systems considered here , namely equimolar mixtures at molar fraction @xmath32 .",
    "a feature of the hrt that is particularly useful is that the domains of coexisting phases are straightforwardly obtained by the theory as the loci where the conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium between different phases are satisfied , without any need of enforcing them _ a posteriori_. fulfillment of these conditions is shown by the collapse of the isothermal sections of the coexistence regions on lines of the @xmath149-@xmath150 plane ,",
    "@xmath149 being the pressure , and @xmath150 the difference between the chemical potentials of the two species .",
    "this property makes also easy to identify the critical points exhibited by the phase diagram at a certain temperature .    according to the results previously obtained by mean - field theory and simulations , the phase diagram of symmetric mixtures at equimolar concentration",
    "is characterized by three different regimes , depending on the value of @xmath4 : at low @xmath4 ( @xmath196 according to mean - field theory  @xcite ) a mixing - demixing critical line joins a mixing - demixing coexistence curve at a critical point , thereby generating a tricritical point . for @xmath4",
    "closer to @xmath6 ( @xmath148 in mean field  @xcite ) , the mixing - demixing critical line joins a liquid - vapor coexistence curve at a critical endpoint .",
    "finally , in a narrow interval in @xmath4 intermediate between the above regimes , the mixture shows both a liquid - vapor coexistence curve and a mixing - demixing one at higher densities , topped respectively by a critical and a tricritical point .",
    "our investigation clearly shows the tricritical point regime as well as the intermediate one .",
    "the latter is predicted to occur starting from about @xmath197 , in agreement with the simulation results for a square - well mixture  @xcite , but it lingers on for larger values of @xmath4 than those given by simulation : according to simulation , the endpoint regime is reached for @xmath198 , while according to hrt @xmath141 is still in the `` transition '' or intermediate regime , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eq3 ] . as a matter of fact",
    ", we did not find any clear evidence of the endpoint regime , since our calculations indicate that the mixture is likely to be in the intermediate regime for @xmath4 as high as @xmath199 .",
    "however , on increasing @xmath4 , the transition region quickly moves to high density , and the finite resolution allowed by the @xmath115 grid used here becomes insufficient to fully uncover the topology of the phase diagram in this parameter range .",
    "for this reason we did not investigate the behavior of the model for @xmath200 .",
    "the results obtained in this work are in qualitative agreement with a study based on the mhnc integral equation for a lj mixture  @xcite , according to which no critical endpoint at equimolar concentration is present up to at least @xmath201 . before drawing any definite conclusion about the resilience of the intermediate topology in the theoretical hrt and mhnc results compared with the simulations and the mean - field approximation , the role of the specific interaction adopted should be elucidated .",
    "in fact , the hrt and mhnc calculations were performed on a hcy and on a lj potential respectively , while in the simulations a hard - sphere plus square - well was used . as observed in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , the hcy potential was also employed in other investigations based on the msa  @xcite , the orpa  @xcite , and the scoza  @xcite theories , all of which yield for the phase diagram the same qualitative picture found in mean - field theory .",
    "however , we do not see any general reason why the independency of the interaction profile which is intrinsic to the mean - field phase behavior should always hold also for more sophisticated approaches , specifically for the hrt .",
    "moreover , one can also imagine a scenario where the existence of a critical endpoint at equimolar concentration is not prevented by the behavior observed here for the phase diagram in the @xmath30-@xmath31 plane , namely the fact that , even for relatively high @xmath4 , the low- and high - density coexistence regions meet first at two points symmetric with respect to @xmath32 rather than at @xmath32 .",
    "however , the present limits in resolution of our numerical calculation do not allow us to say whether this conjecture is actually relevant for the system studied .",
    "an interesting issue that was considered here is how the phase portraits corresponding to the topologies mentioned above look like , if one moves off the plane of equimolar concentration .",
    "in particular , the intermediate regime is marked by the presence , in a certain temperature interval , of a phase coexistence domain with a hole of homogeneous fluid inside it .",
    "this comes along according to two distinct scenarios that can occur as the temperature is lowered : for @xmath202 , the two low - density coexistence regions originating from the pure species meet the high - density coexistence region associated with the mixing - demixing transition , and subsequentely they meet each other , leaving a domain of mixed fluid enclosed inside the two - phase region . for @xmath203 , first the two low - density coexistence regions meet each other , and then the resulting connected domain meets the high - density coexistence region at two points symmetric with respect to concentration @xmath32 , leaving some one - phase fluid in between . in the former case ,",
    "the temperature @xmath204 of the liquid - vapor critical point at @xmath32 is always lower than the tricritical temperature @xmath158 , while in the latter case @xmath204 can be either lower or higher than @xmath158 , depending on @xmath4 .",
    "the present calculation gives @xmath205 starting from about @xmath141 .",
    "because of the existence of both a liquid - vapor and a demixing transition , the critical loci show both a line that spans the concentration axis and connects the critical points of the pure components , and a mixing - demixing line at @xmath32 .",
    "the tricritical point topology corresponds to a situation where these lines are connected , and the character of the transition changes continuously from liquid - vapor at @xmath109 or @xmath110 to mixing - demixing at @xmath32 . in the endpoint regime , which as said above was not observed in the present investigation , the critical lines are instead disconnected , and the transition along the line that connects the critical points of the pure species is essentially of liquid - vapor type .",
    "the intermediate regime between these topologies is characterized by the presence of a further critical line at concentrations ranging in a certain interval centered at @xmath32 , which was referred to above as either the `` crescent '' or the `` fork '' line .",
    "the number of critical points that are found for a certain isothermal section of the phase diagram depends on the relative location of the temperature extrema along the critical lines .",
    "the behavior found by the present hrt calculation agrees qualitatively with that given by mean - field theory . in particular ,",
    "the system is predicted to have up to six critical points at a certain temperature . according to hrt ,",
    "this occurs for a very narrow range of @xmath4 values contained in the interval @xmath182 . at the boundary between the `` crescent '' and the `` fork '' topologies of the critical lines , the system has two tricritical points at symmetric non - equimolar concentrations besides that at concentration @xmath32 . in hrt",
    ", this particular topology occurs for a value of @xmath4 close to @xmath172 , to be compared with the mean - field result @xmath140 . in both cases ,",
    "these values lie very near the boundary between the two different types of one - phase `` holes '' in the phase coexistence region described above .",
    "when @xmath4 is such that mean - field theory and hrt predict the same qualitative topology of the phase diagram , the quantitative discrepancy between the critical loci given by the two approaches is similar to that found for the pure species .",
    "this investigation shows that symmetric mixtures , despite their conceptual simplicity , exhibit a very rich phase behavior . like real mixtures ,",
    "these systems have both liquid - vapor and mixing - demixing transitions .",
    "however , while in real mixtures the liquid - vapor and the mixing - demixing regimes generally correspond to states that differ widely in density and pressure , in symmetric mixtures these transitions can instead be located in the same region of the thermodynamic space . as a consequence ,",
    "they tend to compete with each other , so that even a small variation in the relative strength of the interactions expressed by the parameter @xmath4 is sufficient to bring about significant qualitative changes in the phase diagram .",
    "the results presented here are also relevant for ising ferrofluids in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "more generally , they show that hrt is capable of providing a comprehensive description and resolving even subtle features of the phase behavior of the model . this ability could prove useful to systematically study beyond the mean - field level also the phase diagram of more realistic , non - symmetric model mixtures that depend one more than just one parameter .",
