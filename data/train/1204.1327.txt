    "the study of particle production in heavy ion collisions at energies below their thresholds in nucleon - nucleon collisions was a topic of extensive studies during the 1990s  @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for such study is that it offers the possibility of extracting information on the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) at densities above that of normal nuclear matter . in particular ,",
    "the yield of strange hadrons , such as the kaon , has been shown to be sensitive to the stiffness of the nuclear equation of state up to three times normal nuclear matter density , with a softer eos giving a larger yield than a stiff eos .",
    "indeed , experimental results obtained by the kaos collaboration  @xcite at the society for heavy ion research ( gsi ) in germany on the yield of kaons in heavy ion collisions at subthreshold energies have led to the conclusion that the nuclear equation of state at high densities is soft , consistent with an incompressibility of about 200 mev extracted from the collective flow studies by the plastic ball  @xcite and eos  @xcite collaborations from lawrence berkeley laboratory ( lbl ) and the e877  @xcite and e895  @xcite collaborations at the alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) of brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) .",
    "more recently , the doubly strange baryons @xmath2 from ar+kcl collisions at 1.76a gev , which is below the threshold energy of @xmath6 gev in a nucleon - nucleon collision , was measured by the hades collaboration at gsi  @xcite .",
    "the measured abundance ratio including the statistical and systematic errors is @xmath7 .",
    "this value is about 10 - 20 times larger than those given by the statistical model  @xcite and the relativistic transport model  @xcite . because of the very low collision energy , secondary reactions other than the direct reaction @xmath8",

    "our results thus lead to an abundance ratio @xmath4 , which is essentially consistent with the measured value of @xmath5 by the hades collaboration .    the contributions to @xmath2 production from different reaction channels are also shown in fig.[abundance](c ) .",

    "the contributions are @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 from the reactions @xmath11 , @xmath9 , and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "so the @xmath11 channel dominates @xmath2 production in heavy ion collisions at subthreshold energies .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the cross section for @xmath11 is almost 3 - 4 times the cross section for @xmath9 , and almost hundred times the cross section for @xmath12 . also , the hyperon abundance in the system is almost 20 times the anti - kaon abundance .",
    "we note that the relative contributions to the @xmath2 yield from the reactions @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are about 1 , 4 and 1 .",
    "our results are obtained without the consideration of the isospin asymmetry effect due to different proton and neutron numbers in the colliding nuclei , which is expected to increase the final abundance ratio @xmath166 .",
    "if we assume that the abundance of @xmath2 has reached chemical equilibrium in heavy ion collisions , which is certainly questionable in view of the failure of the statistical model in describing the experimental data , this enhancement can be estimated using @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the charge chemical potential and @xmath169 is the temperature of the system . with the value @xmath170 for @xmath171 or @xmath172 , we have @xmath173 and @xmath174 , leading to the ratio @xmath175 that is @xmath176 larger than that for an isospin symmetric system .",
    "also , the nuclear eos used in the transport model can affect the final @xmath2 abundance in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the results presented in the previous section are based on a soft eos . using a stiff eos",
    ", we find that the @xmath59 , @xmath119 , and @xmath2 abundances are reduced to @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 , respectively .",
    "the reason for this reduction in the hyperon abundances is that the energy density of the colliding system increases faster for a stiff eos , thus making its expansion faster and reaction time short .",
    "however , the abundance ratio @xmath180 for the stiff eos is essentially the same as that for a soft eos .    furthermore , the results presented here are for the impact parameter @xmath3 fm .",
    "a more realistic comparison with experimental data should include a distribution of impact parameters .",
    "we have checked that using different impact parameters , the ratio @xmath166 remains , however , essentially unchanged , since both hyperons and cascade abundances change by almost the same factor .    finally ,",
    "because of the very large @xmath2 production cross sections and the small size of the colliding system , the geometrical treatment of @xmath2 production from hyperon - hyperon scattering in terms of their scattering cross section as used in the rvuu transport model may become inaccurate .",
    "this can be seen from the dependence of final @xmath2 abundance on the value of the cutoff parameter @xmath59 in the form factor used in evaluating the cross sections of the reactions @xmath11 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ yy ] , these cross sections increase with increasing value of @xmath59 .",
    "results from our transport model study show , on the other hand , that the @xmath2 abundance increases with decreasing value of @xmath59 .",
    "however , our conclusion in the present work is expected to remain unchanged since the @xmath2 abundance changes only by about @xmath181 when the @xmath2 production cross sections change by more than a factor of 4 .",
    "we note that a more accurate treatment of particle scattering may be achieved by using the stochastic method of ref .",
    "@xcite based on the transition probability , and we hope to purse such an improved study in the future .",
    "we have calculated the cross sections for the reaction @xmath11 ( @xmath182 , @xmath119 ) based on a gauged su(3)-invariant hadronic lagrangian in the born approximation and found that these cross sections are almost 4 times the cross sections for the reaction @xmath9 that was considered in previous studies .",
    "we then used these cross sections to study @xmath2 production in @xmath136 collisions at the subthreshold energy of 1.76 agev within the frame work of a relativistic transport model that includes explicitly the nucleon , @xmath133 , pion , and perturbatively the kaon , antikaon , hyperons and @xmath2 .",
    "we found that the reaction @xmath13 would enhance the @xmath2 abundance by a factor of about 16 compared to that from the reaction @xmath183 , resulting in abundance ratio @xmath4 that is essentially consistent with that measured by the hades collaboration at gsi .",

    "<S> using a gauged flavor su(3)-invariant hadronic lagrangian , we calculate the cross sections for the strangeness - exchange reactions @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) in the born approximation . </S>",
    "<S> these cross sections are then used in the relativistic vlasov - uehling - uhlenbeck ( rvuu ) transport model to study @xmath2 production in ar+kcl collisions at incident energy of 1.76a gev and impact parameter @xmath3 fm . </S>",
    "<S> we find that including the contributions of hyperon - hyperon scattering channels strongly enhances the yield of @xmath2 , leading to the abundance ratio @xmath4 , which is essentially consistent with the recently measured value of @xmath5 by the hades collaboration at gsi . </S>"
