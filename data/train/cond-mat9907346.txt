    "thermally activated hall coefficient was found .",
    "this is in agreement with the expectations from polaron hopping .",
    "however , for a given magnetic field lowering of the temperature will lead to the formation of a polaron band and a metallic transport , i.e. positive temperature coefficient . in the vicinity of the metal - insulator transition",
    "the polaronic bands are stabilised by external magnetic fields .",
    "therefore we investigated the linear high field hall resistivity in high magnetic fields up to 20 t .",
    "the experimentally determined increase of the hall coefficient at the metal - insulator transition translates into a charge carrier density collapse ( ccdc ) in the band picture .",
    "while such a ccdc in low magnetic field was proposed by alexandrov and bratkovsky @xcite due to formation of immobile bipolarons , our high field results indicate the influence of the structural phase transition at the curie temperature on the band structure .",

    "+ in the following , we consider the high - field regime where the slopes @xmath45 are positive and constant indicating hole conduction . for 4k , we obtain in a single - band model 1.4 holes per unit cell for lsmo .",

    "similar values were found @xcite .",
    "this large charge carrier density in manganites requires the concept of a partly compensated fermi surface @xcite .",
    "+ to investigate the charge carrier concentration just above @xmath5 , it is important to have as high magnetic field as possible in order to saturate the magnetisation . therefore , we performed for lcmo hall effect measurements up to 20 t . in this field",

    "it is yet possible to almost saturate the magnetisation of the sample and a broad field range with a linear positive slope remains to evaluate @xmath39 .",
    "the fit of the slope is seen in fig .  3 by the dashed line .",
    "at 350k ( @xmath49 ) the shift of the minimum in the hall voltage to higher fields allows no longer a quantitative analysis of @xmath39 . + assuming full saturation of the magnetisation in high magnetic field the charge carrier concentration @xmath50 as a function of the reduced temperature @xmath43 for lcmo ( circles ) and lsmo ( triangles ) is plotted in fig .  4 .",
    "lcmo has a constant carrier concentration at low temperatures , whereas for lsmo @xmath6 increases with temperature .",
    "but for both doped manganites clearly a decrease of @xmath6 at the curie temperature is seen .",
    "this temperature dependence of @xmath6 seems to be a characteristic behaviour of the manganites in the vicinity of @xmath5 , since this was also observed by wagner _",

    "the error bars indicate the accuracy of the determination of the linear slopes @xmath45 , as shown for @xmath52 k in fig .  3 .",
    "however , well above the curie temperature the magnetisation of the sample can not be saturated in experimentally accessible magnetic fields . from equation [ rhohall ]",
    "it is obvious , that a linearly increasing magnetisation in this paramagnetic regime will not affect the linearity of the slope @xmath45 but change its value . without quantitative knowledge of the anomalous hall coefficient @xmath40 and the sample magnetisation @xmath53",
    "it is not possible to separate this contribution . nevertheless , since the sign of the anomalous hall contribution is electronlike , it is clear that the apparent charge carrier density shown in fig .",
    "4 has to be corrected to _ lower _ values above the curie temperature , thus _ enhancing _ the ccdc . +",
    "this ccdc indicates strong changes in the electronic distribution function close to the fermi energy . since coincidence of structural , magnetic and electronic phase transitions has been reported for la@xmath54ca@xmath55mno@xmath9 with @xmath56 and 0.5 @xcite , we investigated the temperature dependence of lattice constants , magnetisation , longitudinal resistivity , and transversal resistivity for the same sample .",
    "5 shows a compilation of the results .",
    "the charge carrier density is constant up to 0.7 @xmath5 . in this temperature",
    "range the resistivity follows eq .",
    "[ kubo ] and the volume of the unit cell increases slowly with temperature .",
    "the fact that the ccdc is accompanied by a strong increase in unit cell volume and longitudinal resistivity and a decay of the spontaneous magnetisation shows the coincidence of structural , magnetic , and electronic phase transitions in la@xmath7ca@xmath8mno@xmath9 .",
    "+ since the transport in the manganites above @xmath5 is dominated by polaron hopping @xcite we want to discuss the relation between our experimental observation of the ccdc and the polaronic ccdc as proposed recently by alexandrov and bratkovsky @xcite .",
    "they worked out the theory for a ccdc due to a phase transition of mobile polarons to immobile bipolaronic pairs . at low temperatures",
    "the charge carriers form a polaronic band . with increasing temperature the polaronic bandwidth decreases due to the increase in electron phonon coupling . depending on the polaron binding energy and the doping level a first or second order phase transition to a bound bipolaronic state takes place . at still higher temperatures thermal activation of the bipolarons",
    "leads to a reincrease of the number of mobile polarons .",
    "indeed their calculated temperature dependence of the number density of mobile polarons in zero field is very similar to our data shown in fig .",
    "4 . however",
    ", in this model the density of mobile polarons around @xmath5 is a strong function of magnetic field , which is responsible for the colossal magnetoresistivity . in high fields the polaronic ccdc",
    "is strongly reduced , since the formation of bound bipolarons is suppressed and accordingly the number of mobile polarons remains almost constant at @xmath5 .",
    "therefore our observation of a ccdc in high fields can not be identified with the ccdc due to bipolaron formation , but is related to structural changes .",
    "we can not determine the charge carrier density in the low field regime due to strong anomalous hall contributions .",
    "in their presence the type of phase transition proposed by alexandrov and bratkovsky can not be verified by hall effect measurements .",
    "we performed detailed hall effect measurements in high magnetic fields in lcmo and lsmo thin films .",
    "the charge carrier concentration was investigated as a function of temperature below and above the curie temperature . in the low temperature range ,",
    "where the charge carrier density is constant , we identified electron - magnon scattering in the longitudinal resistivity . at the ferromagnetic transition temperature",
