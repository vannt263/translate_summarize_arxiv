    ", we were able to propose a new average structure model in space group _ fm@xmath41",
    "m _ , which has two improvements on previously published work .",
    "firstly , we identified positional disorder on parts of the metal sublattice , which has an appealing explanation in terms of the defect chemistry in la@xmath0wo@xmath1 .",
    "we find ( fig .",
    "2a ) that the la(2 ) site is split into two 50:50 occupied sites with displacement along the vectors joining neighbouring tungsten sites . when the possible location of oxygen vacancies in the lattice ( fig . 2 and fig .",
    "6 ) are accounted for , this finds a natural explanation , as the la sites relax away from the defects to maintain seven - fold coordination .",
    "as we comment on more fully below , this is naively expected to propagate order through the lattice at temperatures below the onset of oxygen ion conduction .",
    "the second improvement of our model on previous work is the quantification of anti - site disorder .",
    "the possibility of a small amount ( ca .",
    "5% ) of tungsten subsitution on the la(2 ) sites was suggested from dft calculations .",
    "however , no direct evidence of this has yet been presented .",
    "here we used a combination of x - ray and neutron diffraction , and exploited the differing contrasts of these techniques to get a consistent estimate of the anti - site disorder .",
    "when we refined the occupancy of the la(2 ) site against the x - ray data , it rose to above unity , consistent with a small amount of heavier w. indeed the refined x - ray scattering power was equivalent to 53.32 e@xmath42 , where f@xmath31(la@xmath43 ) = 52.79e@xmath42 and f@xmath31(w@xmath38 ) = 68.24e@xmath42 ) .",
    "for the refinement against the neutron diffraction data , we found an average scattering length of 8.12 fm , reduced from the value expected for la ( _ _ b__@xmath44=8.24 fm ) , again consistent with substitution by w ( _ _ b__@xmath44 = 4.86 fm ) .",
    "these measurements thus enabled us to calculate an anti - site disorder of 4.4(2)% .",
    "in addition , out exafs measurements on the w l@xmath3-edge , which are much more sensitive to this small structural perturbation , gave an additional confirmation .",
    "the unique element specificity of exafs means that extra sites are immediately apparent .",
    "here we found an order of magnitude decrease in the fitting residuals of our structure refinement when we included the trace amount of disorder inferred from the diffraction measurements .",
    "+ while the details described above complete the description of the average structure of la@xmath0wo@xmath1 , our results go much further on local length scales .",
    "we were able to obtain qualitative insight into the local structure by using simple chemical concepts .",
    "for example , from an electrostatic point of view , the approximately octahedral coordination of tungsten shown in fig .",
    "2d is by far the most likely as it minimises the repulsion between ligands .",
    "similar effects have been inferred for other simple functional materials , such as scandium and yttrium stabilised zirconias.@xcite this is shown by diffuse scattering observed in neutron powder diffraction experiments , which are sensitive to oxygen order . here , a simple model of two linked octahedra accounts for the peak positions of this scattering ( fig .",
    "this result suggests the intriguing possibility that order might propagate over a limited range , below the coherence length required to produce sharp bragg peaks .",
    "assuming that all octahedra have fixed orientations produces our _ pa@xmath41 _  structure ( fig .",
    "once again , this insight from diffraction is strongly confirmed by our exafs data sets , which were also satisfactorily fitted by this model .",
    "+ we completed our picture of the local structure using real - space refinements against our x - ray pair distribution function data .",
    "this provides a definitive model for the _ pa@xmath41 _",
    "structure which will be of significant use for dft investigations of the mechanism for mixed conduction .",
    "furthermore , since we were able to fourier transform our data out to at least 60  , we could estimate the size of the coherent _ pa@xmath41 _  domains .",
    "this analysis yielded a local coherence length of ca .",
    "3.5 nm . we anticipate that future pdf experiments performed at high temperatures , will enable determination of the link between this length scale and mixed conduction performance in la@xmath0wo@xmath1 .",
    "+ finally , the observation of local order of a limited length scale raises interesting questions .",
    "for example , why is this high entropy ground state favoured in la@xmath0wo@xmath1 ? furthermore , what factors prevent long - range order from establishing itself in this material ?",
    "we conclude our discussion by briefly speculating about connections with a seemingly unrelated field , that of so - called frustrated materials.@xcite these are materials , in which pairwise interactions ( for example an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction , j ) compete due to the lattice connectivity .",
    "long - range order is not established even at temperatures where _ _",
    "k__@xmath45 @xmath46 j. the canonical example is water ice , where local rules enforcing the formation of bent water molecules create a massively degenerate ground state manifold . here",
    "the picture is similar . in our local structure ,",
    "the tungsten cations are placed on a non - bipartite _ fcc _ lattice .",
    "when pairwise interactions are present ( such as our local rule linking the orientation of wo@xmath2 octahedra ) this lattice is frustrated .",
    "we speculate that this also results in a hugely degenerate number of structures for la@xmath0wo@xmath1 , which results in the glassy ground state we observe . indeed ,",
    "our average structure model is nothing more than the result of spatially averaging the orientation of all of the wo@xmath2 octahedra in the sample .",
    "we note in passing , that much as the proton displacements in water ice map to an ising spin model ( spin ice),@xcite the la displacements in la@xmath0wo@xmath1  map to a well - studied ising model on the octahedral lattice.@xcite this comparison may be relevant for future investigations of defect dynamics in la@xmath0wo@xmath1 . for example , the propagation of defects in frustrated models is often quite different to that in standard materials .",
    "for example , protons diffuse through ice,@xcite rather than the hopping motion found in ceramic proton conductors.@xcite we believe future investigations of the local interactions in la@xmath0wo@xmath1   and other mixed conductors are thus well - merited and speculate that so - called function through frustration may be an appealing route to designing new mixed conductors in the future .",
    "in summary , we have reported a detailed study of both the average and the local structure of la@xmath0wo@xmath1 .",
    "we show that former has both positional and substitutional disorder of metal sites , as well as partially occupied anions sites .",
    "however , our diffuse scattering experiments show that on a local scale , rigid wo@xmath2 octahedra are found and we propose a simple defect rule which links the orientation of neighbouring sites .",
