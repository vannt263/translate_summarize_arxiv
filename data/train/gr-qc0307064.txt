    "investigating the final fate of the gravitational collapse of an initially regular distribution of matter , in the framework of the einstein theory of gravitation , is one of the most active fields of research in contemporary general relativity .",
    "one would like to know whether , and under what initial conditions , gravitational collapse results in black hole formation .",
    "one would also like to know if there are physical collapse solutions that lead to naked singularities .",
    "if found , such solutions would be counterexamples of the cosmic censorship hypothesis , which states that curvature singularities in asymptotically flat space - times are always shrouded by event horizons .",
    "roger penrose @xcite was the first to propose the idea , known as cosmic conjecture : does there exist a cosmic censor who forbids the occurrence of naked singularities , clothing each one in an absolute event horizon ?",
    "this conjecture can be formulated in a strong sense ( in a reasonable space - time we can not have a naked singularity ) or in a weak sense ( even if such singularities occur they are safely hidden behind an event horizon , and therefore can not communicate with far - away observers ) . since penrose s proposal , there have been various attempts to prove the conjecture ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "unfortunately , no such attempts have been successful so far .    since ,",
    "due to the complexity of the full einstein equations , the general problem appears intractable , metrics with special symmetries are used to construct gravitational collapse models .",
    "one such case is the two - dimensional reduction of general relativity obtained by imposing spherical symmetry .",
    "even with this reduction , however , very few inhomogeneous exact nonstatic solutions have been found .",
    "one well - known example is the vaidya metric @xcite .",
    "it describes the gravitational field associated with the eikonal approximation of an isotropic flow of unpolarized radiation , or , in other words , it represents a null fluid .",
    "it is asymptotically flat and it is employed in modeling the external field of radiating stars and evaporating black holes .",
    "the second one is the tolman - bondi metric @xcite , which gives the gravitational field associated with dust matter and is frequently applied either in cosmological models or in describing the collapse of a star to a black - hole .",
    "tolman - bondi space - times embody the schwarzschild solution , the friedman universes and the oppenheimer - snyder collapse , as well as inhomogeneous expansions and collapses .    at first sight",
    "these two metrics are completely different . do the naked singularities that form in the collapse of null radiation and in the collapse of dust bear any relation with each other ? are there any features common to both solutions",
    "? and if this is the case , what are the implications for cosmic censorship ? as shown by lemos @xcite , the naked singularities which appear in vaidya and tolman - bondi space - times are of the same nature .",
    "various important features such as the degree of inhomogeneity of the collapse necessary to produce a naked singularity , the cauchy horizon equation , the apparent horizon equation , the strength of the singularity and the stability of the space - time have a mutual correspondence in both metrics . for cosmic censorship",
    ", this result implies that if the shell - focusing singularities arising from the collapse of a null fluid are not artifacts of some ( eikonal ) approximation , then the shell - focusing singularities arising from the collapse of dust are also not artifacts ( and vice versa ) .",
    "conversely , if the naked singularities are artifacts in one of them so are they in the other .",
    "thus the vaidya metric belongs to the tolman - bondi family .",
    "the most unbound case yields the vaydia metric .",
    "hence one expects that major features which might arise in one of the metrics will also appear in the other .",
    "one example is the result that the strength in the vaidya metric depends on the direction from which the geodesics enter the singularity @xcite .",
    "null fluids , are , in principle , easier to treat than matter fields . a null fluid is the eikonal approximation of a massless scalar field .",
    "thus if one shows that the naked singularities arising in the vaidya metric can be derived from more fundamental ( massless ) fields , then the naked singularities , which form in the tolman - bondi collapse , may also be derived from more fundamental ( massive ) fields .",
    "the same types of relations and conclusions hold for charged radiation and charged dust matter .",
    "the structure and properties of singularities in the gravitational collapse in vaidya space - times have been analyzed , from different points of view , in @xcite-@xcite .    within the framework of various physical models ,",
    "the spherical gravitational collapse has been analyzed in many papers .",
    "the role of initial density and velocity distributions towards determining the final outcome of spherical dust collapse and the causal structure of the singularity has been examined in terms of evolution of apparent horizon in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the collapse was described by the tolman - bondi metric with two free functions .",
    "the collapse can end in either a black hole or a naked singularity .",
    "the occurrence and nature of naked singularities in the szekeres space - times have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "these space - times represent irrotational dust .",
    "they do not have any killing vectors and they are the generalizations of the tolman - bondi space - times .",
    "there also exist naked singularities that satisfy both the limiting focusing condition and the strong limiting focusing conditions .",
    "the relevance of the initial state of a collapsing dust cloud towards determining its final fate in the course of a continuing gravitational collapse has been considered in @xcite . given any arbitrary matter distribution for the cloud in the initial epoch , there is always the freedom to chose the rest of the initial data , namely the initial velocities of the collapsing spherical shells , so that , depending on this choice , the collapse could result either in a black hole or a naked singularity .",
    "thus , given the initial density profile , to achieve the desired end state of the gravitational collapse one has to give a suitable initial velocity of the cloud .",
    "the expression for the expansion of outgoing null geodesics in spherical dust collapse has been derived in @xcite the limiting values of the expansion in the approach to singularity formation have been computed . using these results",
    "one can show that the covered , as well as the naked singularity solutions arising in spherical dust collapse , are stable under small changes in the equation of state .",
    "the growth of the weyl curvature is examined in two examples of naked singularity formation in spherical gravitational collapse - dust and vaidya space - time- in @xcite .",
    "the weyl scalar diverges along outgoing radial null geodesics as they meet the naked singularity in the past .",
    "although general relativity admits naked singularities arising from gravitational collapse , the second law of thermodynamics could forbid their occurrence in nature .",
    "a simple model for a corona of a neutrino - radiating star showing critical behavior is presented in @xcite .",
    "the conditions for the existence or absence of a bounce ( explosion ) are discussed .",
    "the charged vaidya metric was extended to cover all of the space - time in @xcite and the penrose diagram for the formation and evaporation of a charged black hole obtained .",
    "the covariant equations characterizing the strength of a singularity in spherical symmetry and a slight modification to the definition of singularity strength have been derived in @xcite .",
    "the idea of probing naked space - times singularities with waves rather than with particles has been proposed in @xcite . for some space - times",
    "the classical singularity becomes regular if probed with waves , while stronger classical singularities remain singular .    in order to obtain the energy - momentum tensor for the collapse of a null fluid",
    "an inverted approach was proposed by husain @xcite .",
    "first the stress - energy momentum tensor is determined from the metric .",
    "then the equation of state and the dominant energy condition are imposed on its eigenvalues .",
    "this leads to an equation for the metric function .",
    "the precise form of the stress - energy tensor is then displayed . by using this approach several classes of solutions describing the collapse of a null fluid , satisfying barotropic and polytropic type equations of state ,",
    "have been obtained . in the framework of the same approach a large class of solutions , including type ii fluids , and which includes most of the known solutions of the einstein field equations ,",
    "has been derived , in four dimensions by wang and wu @xcite , and in @xmath0 dimensions by villas da rocha @xcite .",
    "the vaidya radiating metric has been extended to include both a radiation field and a string fluid by glass and krisch @xcite , @xcite and by govinder and govender @xcite .    when nuclear matter is squeezed to a sufficiently high density",
    ", a phase transition takes place and neutron matter converts into three - flavor ( strange ) quark matter , which is due to the fact that strange matter may be more stable than nuclear matter .",
    "the collapse of the quark fluid , described by the bag model equation of state @xmath1 , with @xmath2constant , has been studied by harko and cheng @xcite and the conditions for the formation of a naked singularity have been obtained .",
    "the obtained solution has been generalized to arbitrary space - time dimensions and to a more general linear equation of state by ghosh and dadhich @xcite , @xcite .    in 1965",
    "hagedorn @xcite postulated that for large masses @xmath3 the spectrum of hadrons @xmath4 grows exponentially , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , the hagedorn temperature , is a scale parameter .",
    "the hypothesis was based on the observation that at some point a further increase of energy in proton - proton and proton - antiproton collisions no longer raises the temperature of the formed fireball , but results in more and more particles being produced .",
    "thus there is a maximum temperature @xmath6 that a hadronic system can achieve .",
    "the statistical model of the hadrons has been used to obtain a description of dense matter at densities exceeding nuclear density .",
    "the hagedorn phase also arises in theories containing fundamental strings , because they have a large number of internal degrees of freedom @xcite . as a result of the existence of many oscillator modes the density of states grows exponentially with single string energy .",
    "thermodynamical quantities , such as the entropy , diverge at the hagedorn temperature .",
    "if one considers an ensemble of weekly interacting strings at finite temperature , this behavior of the density of states is thought to lead either to a limiting temperature or a phase transition , in which the string configuration changes to one which is dominated by a single long string @xcite .",
    "the high density hagedorn phase of matter has been extensively used in cosmology to describe the very early phases of the evolution of the universe @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to study the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of the charged matter in the hagedorn phase . in order to simplify the mathematical formalism",
    "we adopt the assumption that the high density fluid moves along the null geodesics of a vaidya type space - time . the vaidya geometry , also permitting the incorporation of the effects of the radiation , offers a more realistic background than static geometries , where all back reaction is ignored . by adopting the hagedorn equation of state for dense matter",
    ", the general solution of the field equations can be obtained in an exact form . for the sake of comparison",
    "we also consider the collapse of matter described by the stiff zeldovich equation of state .",
    "the conditions of formation of naked singularities are obtained in both cases .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "the field equations describing the collapse of a hagedorn fluid are written down in section ii .",
    "the general solution of the field equations is presented in section iii .",
    "the equation of the null outgoing geodesics and the conditions of the formation of the naked singularities are discussed in section iv .",

    "however , the most popular model involves the violent formation of an approximately one solar mass black hole , surrounded by a similarly massive debris torus .",
    "the formation of the black hole and debris torus may take place through the coalescence of a compact binary or the collapse of a quickly rotating massive stellar core @xcite .",
    "there are still many open problems concerning grbs , from which the most important is the problem of the source of the large energy emission during the bursts . on the other hand naked singularities as sources of @xmath218-ray bursts",
    "have also been proposed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the fact that explosive radiation can be emitted during the gravitational collapse to a naked singularity of a dust ball has also been pointed out recently by @xcite .    as an astrophysical application of the hagedorn fluid collapse in the vaidya geometry we consider the possibility that gamma - ray bursts could in fact be energy emission during the collapse of a neutral , @xmath156 , high density matter in the hagedorn phase , ending with the formation of a naked singularity .",
    "an estimation of the energy emitted during the collapse shows that it is of the same order of magnitude as the one measured during @xmath219 ray bursts .",
    "hence this mechanism could provide a valuable explanation for this phenomenon , also opening the possibility of the observational investigation of the astrophysical properties of the naked singularities .",
    "the arbitrary integration functions @xmath78 and @xmath128 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) , describe the injection and initial distribution of the mass , respectively .",
    "their exact mathematical form can not be obtained in the framework of the present formalism .",
    "the only requirements that the functional form of these functions must satisfy are the dominant energy conditions and the condition that the equation of the radially outgoing , future - directed null geodesics , originating at the singularity @xmath220 , be uniquely defined and exist at the singular point @xmath155 and has at least one positive root .",
    "a positive root of the geodesic equation leads to the possibility of formation of a naked singularity as a result of the collapse .",
    "some simple integration functions satisfying the condition on the geodesic equation , as well as the dominant energy conditions , are , for example , @xmath221 , @xmath182 , with @xmath222 , @xmath223 constants . with this choice a naked singularity may form during the collapse of the hagedorn fluid if and only if the algebraic equation @xmath224 has at least one positive root @xmath206 .",
    "this condition requires @xmath195 .",
    "of course many other choices are also possible .",
    "naked singularities are gravitational singularities that are not covered by a horizon . near the singularity",
    "the space - time curvature and the gravitational tidal forces grow very strongly . during the collapse naked singularities could emit powerful bursts of radiation visible to a distant external observer situated far away from the sight of the collapse @xcite .    as a first physical parameter we need to estimate is the time @xmath225 necessary for a matter element at the surface of the star to reach the center @xmath155 of the collapsed object , as a function of the mass at the center .",
    "this can be done by evaluating the time derivative of the mass , given by eq .",
    "( [ cent ] ) with @xmath226 , at the center of the naked singularity : @xmath227    by integrating the above equation from @xmath228 to @xmath225 we obtain @xmath229 where we assumed @xmath230 and denoted @xmath231 . in order to find an explicit expression for @xmath225 we shall approximate the integral in eq .",
    "( [ wab ] ) by using the first mean value theorem for integrals , which states that for any arbitrary function @xmath232 , @xmath233 , where @xmath234 .",
    "@xmath235 is called the average value of @xmath236 . hence , in the following we shall approximate the derivatives of the arbitrary the arbitrary integration functions and the functions themselves by their average values . therefore from eq .",

    "the initial mass distribution of the hagedorn fluid can be obtained from the study of the mass distribution at the initial moment @xmath228 : @xmath242 .\\ ] ]    by integrating this equation , and using again the first mean value theorem , it follows that the initial mass profile of the hagedorn fluid can be represented as @xmath243 where @xmath244 is the average value of the @xmath13-dependent function @xmath245 \\mid _ { t=0}$ ] , with the function @xmath246 estimated at some point @xmath247 , @xmath248 , with @xmath249 the radius of the hagedorn fluid distribution .",
    "hence @xmath250 . from this equation",
    "we can see that our approach implies a linear profile of the initial mass distribution of the star .",
    "@xmath251 , the average value of the spatial derivatives of the integration functions @xmath128 and @xmath78 at @xmath252 , is completely determined by the initial conditions , that is by the total initial mass of the star @xmath253 and by its initial radius @xmath249 via the relation @xmath254    in order to calculate the energy emitted during the hagedorn fluid collapse we shall admit that the luminosity of the collapsing object should not exceed the rate of collapsing matter energy @xcite .",
    "the variation of the mass of the high density fluid during collapse is given by @xmath255 \\approx \\left [ \\frac{dd(u)}{du}\\delta u+\\rho _ { 0}r% \\frac{dc(u)}{du}\\delta u+\\rho _ { 0}c(u)\\delta r\\right ] .\\ ] ]    the variation of the advanced time coordinate @xmath91 is given by the approximate expression @xmath256 , where we defined @xmath257 as being the speed of the collapsing fluid as measured by a local observer .",
    "then we obtain @xmath258 c\\left ( 1+\\frac{v_{f}}{c}\\right ) \\delta t.   \\label{en1}\\ ] ]    we assume that the energy emission occurs mainly from a small region near the center of the naked singularity",
    ". hence we shall evaluate eq .",
    "( [ en1 ] ) near @xmath13 very close to zero .",
    "then from eq .",
    "( [ mt ] ) we can roughly approximate @xmath259 . since for a small @xmath13 , @xmath260 , we can also neglect in this limit the term @xmath261 . from the field",
    "( [ dens ] ) and from eq .",
    "( [ densx ] ) it immediately follows that @xmath262 .",
    "taking into account eq .",
    "( [ prof ] ) we immediately find @xmath263 .",
    "the velocity @xmath264 of the collapsing matter can be obtained from @xmath265 .    with the use of the previous results we obtain for the total energy emitted per unit time during the collapse of a hagedorn fluid to a naked singularity the expression : @xmath266 \\left ( 1+\\frac{v_{f}}{c}\\right ) \\frac{c^{5}}{g}\\text { erg s}^{-1}. \\label{en}\\ ] ]",
    "hence we have expressed the total energy of the radiation , which could be emitted from a naked singularity , in terms of the average values of the derivatives of the arbitrary integration functions . by assuming an emission time of the order of @xmath267 s and a velocity of the collapsing matter of the order @xmath268cm / s we obtain a value of the emitted energy @xmath269 \\times 10^{55}$]erg .",
    "therefore the energy which could be emitted during the collapse of the hagedorn fluid to a naked singularity could exceed in magnitude the energy @xmath270 erg , observed for grb990123 @xcite .",
    "of course the exact value of the energy depends on the exact numerical values of the constants @xmath251 and @xmath271 . by comparing eq .",
    "( [ en ] ) with the observational data it is possible to determine the values of @xmath251 and @xmath200 .    under the effect of the collapse the compact object will heat up to a temperature of the order of @xmath272k , higher than that occurring in super nova explosions .",
    "since @xmath6 can not be exceeded , the gravitational energy of the compact object is converted into new particles , which will be generated during the collapse .",
    "most of the newly created particle will decay via weak interaction processes . as a result",
    "a neutrinosphere will form around the naked singularity .",
    "therefore the main energy loss mechanism of the super - heated collapsed astrophysical object would be neutrino radiation .",
    "the neutrinos and anti neutrinos interact with protons and neutrons via the urca processes @xmath273 , @xmath274 . at temperatures higher than the nuclear fermi temperature @xmath275 that can also be expressed in the form @xmath276 @xcite ,",
    "the integrated optical neutrino depth is unity .",
    "hence the deposition energy can be estimated as @xmath277 ergs .",
    "the process @xmath278 will generate a fireball that will expand outward .",
    "the expanding shell interacts with the inter stellar medium surrounding the hagedorn type naked singularity , and the kinetic energy is finally radiated through non - thermal processes in shocks @xcite .",
    "the energy released during the collapse of the hagedorn and radiation fluids into a naked singularity has the same order of magnitude as that observed in the case of gamma ray bursts .",
    "this strongly suggests the possibility that gamma ray bursts could be massive compact objects , formed from a hagedorn fluid , collapsing to a naked singularity in a cosmological environment .",
    "in the present paper we have considered the collapse of a hagedorn type fluid in the vaidya geometry .",
    "the exact solution obtained represents the generalization , for hagedorn type matter , of the collapsing solutions previously obtained by vaidya @xcite , bonnor and vaidya @xcite , lake and zannias @xcite and husain @xcite . from a mathematical point of view",
    "the solution is represented in a parametric form .",
    "it satisfies all the energy conditions and consequently describes the collapse to a singular state .",
    "the possible occurrence of a central naked singularity has also been investigated and it has been shown that , at least for a particular choice of the parameters , a naked singularity is formed .",
    "depending on the initial distribution of density and velocity and on the constitutive nature of the collapsing matter , either a black hole or a naked singularity is formed .",
    "the values of the parameters in the solution ( [ mass ] ) and ( [ densx ] ) determine which of these possibilities occurs .",
    "the solution describing the collapse of both the hagedorn and zeldovich matter is asymptotically flat , but this condition does not play any significant role in the formation of the naked singularity .    the hagedorn type matter may reside as a permanent component of neutron stars core at high temperatures or densities and form stable compact stellar objects .",
    "in fact , from a physical point of view , it seems that the high density limit for the equation of state described by the hagedorn equation of state is one of the best and more realistic candidates for the study of properties of collapsing objects .",
    "it also serves to illustrate the much richer interplay that can occur among particle physics and general relativity , when more involved quantum field theoretical models are considered .    as a possible simple astrophysical application of this collapsing solution we have considered the possibility that gamma ray bursts could be energy emission during the collapse of a high density star , ending in the formation of a naked singularity",
    ". the radiated energy during this process could be as high as @xmath279ergs .",
    "thus the naked singularity explosion could be a candidate for the central engine of a gamma ray burst ."
