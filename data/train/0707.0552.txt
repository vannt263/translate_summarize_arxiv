    "the conjectured equivalence of string theory on anti - de sitter ( ads ) spaces and certain superconformal gauge theories living on the boundary of ads @xcite has lead recently to an increasing interest in asymptotically anti - de sitter ( aads ) black holes .",
    "this type of solutions are of special interest since they offer the possibility of studying the nonperturbative structure of some conformal field theories ( cfts ) .",
    "it is therefore desirable to widen the existing aads classes of solutions as much as possible , the case of five dimensional solutions being of particular interest , given the conjectured equivalence between @xmath1 , @xmath2 su(n ) ym theory and supergravity solutions in ads@xmath3 .",
    "rotating black holes with ads asymptotics in @xmath0 have been studied by various authors , starting with hawking @xmath4 @xcite who found the higher dimensional counterparts of the kerr - ads@xmath5 solution .",
    "charged rotating black holes solutions in @xmath0 gauged supergravity have been constructed in @xcite .",
    "apart from abelian fields with a chern - simons term , these configurations usually contain scalar fields with a nontrivial scalar potential .",
    "rotating black hole solutions in pure einstein - maxwell ( em ) theory with negative cosmological constant have been constructed numerically in recent work @xcite .    at the same time , one should remark that gauged supergravity theories playing an important role in ads / cft , generically contain non - abelian matter fields in the bulk , although in the literature mainly abelian truncations are considered , to date .",
    "the lack of attention given to aads einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) solutions is presumably due to the notorious absence of closed form solutions in this case .",
    "however , one can analyse their properties by using a combination of analytical and numerical methods , which is enough for most purposes . thus",
    ", the examination of ads@xmath3 gravitating non - abelian solutions with @xmath6 is a pertinent task .",
    "practically , all that is known in the subject of @xmath0 aads non - abelian solutions are the eym - su(2 ) spherically symmetric configurations discussed in @xcite and the static solutions in @xcite of the @xmath7 version of the romans gauged supergravity model @xcite .",
    "these solutions share a number of properties with the better known @xmath2 eym aads configurations discussed in @xcite,@xcite . in both cases , regular and black hole solutions exist for compact intervals of the parameter that specifies the initial conditions at the origin or at the event horizon .",
    "the gauge field approaches asymptotically a configuration which is not a pure gauge , resulting in a nonvanishing magnetic flux through the sphere at infinity .",
    "however , different from the four dimensional case , the mass of an ads@xmath3 configuration as defined in the usual way presents a logarithmic divergence . in the recent work @xcite ,",
    "a counterterm based method has been proposed to regularise the action and mass - energy of the non - abelian ads@xmath3 solutions . in this approach ,",
    "the logarithmic divergence of the action results in a trace anomaly in the dual cft .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to present numerical arguments for the existence of rotating aads@xmath3 non - abelian black hole solutions . instead of specializing to a particular supergravity model",
    ", we shall consider the simpler case of a eym - su(2 ) theory with negative cosmological constant .",
    "although it seems that this theory is not a consistent truncation of any @xmath0 supersymmetric model , it enters the gauged supergravities as the basic building block and one can expect the basic features of its solutions to be generic .",
    "also , we shall restrict here to the case of rotating solutions with equal magnitude angular momenta and a spherical topology of the event horizon , which allows us to deal with ordinary differential equations ( odes ) .",
    "these solutions share a number of common features with the @xmath2 counterparts discussed in @xcite , @xcite . in both cases",
    ", one finds rotating solutions starting with any static configuration .",
    "the rotating black holes have a nonzero electric charge and a nonvanishing flux through the sphere at infinity .",
    "however , different from the ads@xmath5 case @xcite , here no rotating soliton solutions are found in the limit of zero event horizon radius .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we present the general framework and analyse the field equations and boundary conditions .",
    "the black hole properties are discussed in section 3 .",
    "we present the numerical results in section 4 .",
    "we conclude with section 5 where the results are compiled .",
    "we consider the five dimensional su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) action with negative cosmological constant @xmath8 @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the gravitational constant , @xmath11 is the ricci scalar associated with the spacetime metric @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the gauge field strength tensor defined as @xmath14 , $ ] with a gauge potential @xmath15 @xmath16 being the pauli matrices and @xmath17 the gauge coupling constant .",
    "@xmath18 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature for the boundary @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the induced metric of the boundary .",
    "variation of the action ( [ action5 ] ) with respect to @xmath21 and @xmath22 leads to the field equations @xmath23=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the ym stress - energy tensor is @xmath24      while the general eym - ads rotating black holes would possess two independent angular momenta and a more general topology of the event horizon , we restrict here to configurations with equal magnitude angular momenta and a spherical horizon topology .",
    "the suitable metric ansatz reads @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 $ ] , @xmath27 $ ] , @xmath28 and @xmath29 being the radial and time coordinates .",
    "this line element presents five killing vectors @xmath30 the computation of the appropriate su(2 ) connection compatible with the symmetries of the metric ansatz ( [ metric ] ) can be done by applying the standard rules for calculating the gauge potentials for any spacetime group @xcite . according to forgacs and manton , a gauge field admit a spacetime symmetry if the spacetime transformation of the potential can be compensated by a gauge transformation @xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32 stands for the lie derivative .",
    "the expression we find in this way for the gauge field ansatz is @xmath33 the only nonvanishing components of the compensating potentials @xmath34 being @xmath35 the general ansatz ( [ metric ] ) , ( [ ansatz - gauge ] ) can be proven to be consistent , and , as a result , the eym equations reduce to a set of seven odes ( in the numerics , we fix the metric gauge by taking @xmath36 ) .",
    "the solutions have a spherically symmetric limit with @xmath37 whose basic properties were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the vacuum rotating black holes in @xcite with two equal angular momenta are recovered for a vanishing gauge field , @xmath38 ( or , equivalently , @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 and @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are two constants related to the solution s mass and angular momenta .",
    "the einstein - maxwell solutions in @xcite are recovered for the metric ansatz ( [ metric ] ) written in an isotropic coordinate system and an u(1 ) subgroup of ( [ ansatz - gauge ] ) , obtained for @xmath44 .",
    "similar to the vacuum case ( [ vacuum ] ) , the horizon of these rotating black holes is a squashed @xmath45 sphere and resides at a constant value of the radial coordinate @xmath46 , being characterized by @xmath47 . at the horizon ,",
    "the solutions satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are free parameters ( with @xmath52 ) .",
    "we find also the following asymptotic expansion as @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are real constants .",
    "note that these asymptotics preserve the full ads symmetry group .",
    "one can see that , similar to the static case , the @xmath58 component of the metric has a term proportional with @xmath59 , which leads to a divergent value of the mass - energy as defined in the usual way , unless @xmath60 or @xmath61 . however , we could not find rotating non - abelian solutions with these values of @xmath62 .",
    "this agrees with the physical intuition based on a heuristic derick - type scaling argument , although a rigorous proof exists for the spherically symmetric limit only @xcite .",
    "the mass - energy and angular momenta or these solutions is computed by using the procedure proposed by balasubramanian and kraus @xcite , which furnishes a means for calculating the gravitational action and conserved quantities without reliance on any reference spacetime .",
    "this technique was inspired by ads / cft correspondence and consists of adding suitable counterterms @xmath63 to the action of the theory in order to ensure the finiteness of the boundary stress tensor @xcite .",
    "as found in @xcite , the following counterterms are sufficient to cancel divergences in five dimensions , for ads@xmath3 vacuum black hole solutions ( here @xmath64 is the ricci scalar for the boundary metric @xmath20 ) @xmath65\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using these counterterms one can construct a divergence - free stress tensor from the total action @xmath66 by defining @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the einstein tensor of the intrinsic metric @xmath69 .",
    "the presence of the additional matter fields in the bulk action brings the potential danger of having divergent contributions coming from both the gravitational and matter action @xcite .",
    "various examples of aads solutions whose action and mass _ can not _ be regularized by employing only the counterterm ( [ ct ] ) have been presented in the literature .",
    "this is also the case of the ads@xmath3 non - abelian solutions , where the backreaction of the gauge fields causes certain metric components to fall off slower than usual . as a result ,",
    "the action and the mass - energy present generically a logarithmic divergence , unless one considers corrections to the ym lagrangean consisting of higher order terms of the yang  mills hierarchy @xcite .",
    "however , in such cases , it is still possible to obtain a finite mass and action by allowing @xmath63 to depend not only on the boundary metric @xmath69 , but also on the matter fields .",
    "the matter counterterm expression which is added to @xmath70 for ads@xmath3 non - abelian solutions is @xcite ( with @xmath71 boundary indices ) @xmath72 which yields a supplementary contribution to ( [ s1 ] ) @xmath73 provided the boundary geometry has an isometry generated by a killing vector @xmath74 , a conserved charge @xmath75 can be associated with a closed surface @xmath76 @xcite . if @xmath77 then @xmath78 is the conserved mass / energy @xmath79 ; there are also two angular momenta associated with the killing vectors @xmath80 and @xmath81 .    as a result",
    ", we find the following expressions for mass - energy and angular momentum of the solutions in this paper : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a constant terms interpreted as the mass - energy of the ads@xmath3 background @xcite and @xmath84 is the area of the three sphere .",
    "one can prove that the term ( [ ict - mat ] ) regularizes also the tree level action of the solutions .",
    "these solutions have also an electric charge @xmath85 by using the fact that the integral of the angular momentum density can be written as a difference of two boundary integrals @xcite , one writes @xmath86 ( a similar relation holds for @xmath87 ) . making use of the einstein equations , one finds the following relation @xmath88 relating global charges to event horizon quantities .",
    "it is also of interest to evaluate the integral of @xmath89 .",
    "this measures the contribution of the non - abelian electric field to the mass / energy of the system .",
    "similar to the four dimensional case , by using the ym equations this integral can be expressed as @xmath90 thus , for globally regular configurations , a vanishing magnitude of the electric potentials at infinity implies a purely magnetic solution .",
    "in contrast , one finds rotating black hole solutions with @xmath91 which are supported by the event horizon contribution . since the asymptotic expansion ( [ a1 ] ) holds for both globally regular and black hole solutions ,",
    "we conclude that there are no rotating eym - su(2 ) solitons in ads@xmath3 ( the condition @xmath92 follows from the physical requirement that the spacetime approach the ads background at infinity ) .",
    "however , rotating soliton solutions are likely to exist for a larger gauge group .",
    "the killing vector @xmath93 is orthogonal to and null on the horizon . for the solutions within the ansatz ( [ metric ] ) ,",
    "the event horizon s angular velocities are all equal , @xmath94 .",
    "the hawking temperature as found by computing the surface gravity is @xmath95 another quantity of interest is the area @xmath96 of the rotating black hole horizon @xmath97 as usual , one identifies the entropy of black hole solutions with one quarter of the even horizon area , @xmath98 .    to have a measure of the deformation of the horizon",
    ", we introduce a deformation parameter defined as the ratio of the equatorial circumference @xmath99 and the polar one @xmath100 , which for these solutions we are considering takes the form @xmath101 these rotating solutions present also an ergoregion inside of which the observers can not remain stationary , and will move in the direction of rotation .",
    "the ergoregion is the region bounded by the event horizon , located at @xmath46 and the stationary limit surface , or the ergosurface , @xmath102 .",
    "the killing vector @xmath103 becomes null on the ergosurface , @xmath104 @xmath105 .",
    "the ergosurface does not intersect the horizon .",
    "although we have considered other values as well , the numerical results reported in this section corresponds to @xmath106 , which is also the value taken in the study @xcite of the static solutions .",
    "dimensionless quantities are obtained by using the rescaling @xmath107 , and @xmath108 . to integrate the equations",
    ", we used the differential equation solver colsys which involves a newton - raphson method @xcite .",
    "we start the description here by recalling the situation in the static limit .",
    "spherically symmetric non - abelian black holes exist for any value of the event horizon radius , a globally regular configuration being approached as @xmath109 .",
    "the parameter @xmath62 in the boundary conditions at infinity is not fixed ; however , one finds the existence of a minimal value of @xmath62 , which depends on @xmath110 .",
    "the mass of spherically symmetric black holes as defined in ( [ mt - rot ] ) may take negative values as well , for a range of ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "one notice also the possible existence of several configurations for the same set @xmath112 .",
    "the rotating solutions we have found preserve this general picture . as expected , we could find rotating solutions starting with any static black hole .",
    "rotating solutions are obtained by increasing the value of @xmath113 or @xmath114 . , @xmath113 ( or @xmath115 ) together with @xmath116 , @xmath47 , and a set of three more complicated conditions at the horizon involving both the functions and their derivatives . ] for all the solutions we studied , the metric functions @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 interpolate monotonically between the corresponding values at @xmath46 and the asymptotic values at infinity , without developing any pronounced local extrema .",
    "( the magnetic gauge potentials present , however , a more complicated behaviour . ) as a typical example , we present in figure @xmath121 the profile of two solutions with the same values of @xmath122 and @xmath113 .",
    "these configurations are clearly distict and have different global charges .",
    "the basic geometrical features of these rotating solutions are rather similar to the vacuum or u(1 ) case ( @xmath123 the presence of an ergosphere and the fact that the horizon is deformed only . ] ) .    in the numerics",
    "we have paid special attention to the solutions dependence on the magnitude of the magnetic potentials at infinity @xmath62 , which is a purely non - abelian feature . even in this case",
    ", the configurations present a very rich structure , which makes their complete classification in the space of physical parameters a considerable task which is not aimed in this paper .",
    "instead , we analyzed in details a few particular classes of solutions which , hopefully , reflect all the properties of the general pattern .    a feature of the rotating solutions we have studied so far is the existence of two different solutions for the same values of ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "these solutions have different global charges and distinct temperatures .",
    "no upper limit on @xmath62 seems to exist ( although the numerics become very difficult for large @xmath62 ) .",
    "when fixing the event horizon radius and the rotation parameter @xmath113 ( or @xmath115 ) , we have noticed , similar to the static case , the existence of a minimal value of @xmath62 , say @xmath125 .",
    "at that point , a secondary branch of solutions emerges , which extends to larger values of @xmath62 .",
    "this behaviour is illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "the occurrence of a minimal value of @xmath126 makes it unlikely that the non - abelian black holes constructed here are bifurcations of the abelian solutions which correspond to setting @xmath127 in the equations .",
    "we have also studied the dependence of solutions properties on the value of the event horizon radius for fixed @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the numerical results strongly support the existence of two branches of rotating black hole solutions which join at a maximal value of @xmath110 ( see figure 3a ) .",
    "this result further suggests that no solution exist for higher values of the event horizon @xmath110 .",
    "as expected , the same pattern is found when taking instead a constant value of the event horizon velocity instead of @xmath129 , see figure 3b .    when a rotating black hole solution is considered for @xmath130 with the other parameters fixed",
    ", we observe that @xmath131 converge to zero ( in fact the electric potential @xmath132 tends to zero uniformly in this limit ) as well as @xmath129 . in the same time",
    "the value @xmath133 goes to infinity , so that the rotation function @xmath120 becomes more and more peaked at @xmath46 .    as a result",
    ", no rotating soliton solution is found .",
    "finally , we examine the properties of the solutions on the value @xmath113 of the event horizon velocity .",
    "the numerical results obtained suggest that @xmath134 depends weakly on @xmath113 .",
    "similar to the vacuum of em cases , we noticed here again the existence of two branches of solutions . however , no definite conclusion is unfortunately available due to severe numerical difficulties that we met when increasing the value of @xmath113 .",
    "the evolution of different parameter characterizing this family of solutions is reported on figure 4 for @xmath135 ; as far as we could see there is no signal that the two branches will meet at a maximal value of @xmath113 , as happens for vacuum or em rotating solutions ( for @xmath136 we could integrate the first branch up to @xmath137 and the second branch up to @xmath138 , the numerical results becoming unreliable for larger values of @xmath113 ) .",
    "this suggests that the two branches remain may open and exist for large values of the angular momentum .",
    "integration of the equations with a different technique and/or a different metric parametrization may clarify this issue .",
    "the main purpose of this paper was to present arguments for the existence of a general class of five dimensional ads charged rotating solutions in eym theory , in which the two angular momenta are equal .",
    "these solutions depend on four nontrivial parameters , namely the the mass , the angular momenta , the electric charge and the essential value of a magnetic potential at infinity .",
    "this class of solutions may provide a fertile ground for further study of charged rotating configurations in gauged supergravity models and one expects some of their properties to be generic .",
    "our preliminary results indicate the presence of similar solutions in the @xmath139 version of the romans gauged supergravity model , with a dilaton potential presenting a stationary point @xcite .",
    "rotating eym topological black holes with an horizon of negative curvature are also likely to exist for @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , it would be interesting to generalize these solutions to higher dimensions , thus extending the study of charged u(1 ) black holes in @xcite to eym-@xmath140 theory .",
    "the study of the solutions discussed in this paper in an ads / cft context is an interesting open question .",
    "a generic property of the non - abelian fields in aads backgrounds is that they do not approach asymptotically a pure gauge configuration .",
    "the boundary form of the non - abelian potential ( [ ansatz - gauge ] ) is @xmath141 with a nonzero boundary field strength tensor @xmath142 ( note that @xmath143 can be gauged away in the abelian limit @xmath60 ) . on the cft side",
    ", these fields corresponds to external source currents coupled to various operators .",
    "the metric on which the boundary cft is defined is found by as @xmath144 , and corresponds to a static einstein universe in four dimensions , @xmath145 one can use the ads / cft `` dictionary '' to predict qualitative features of a quantum field theory in this background .",
    "for example , the expectation value of the dual cft stress - tensor can be calculated using the relation @xcite @xmath146 for these solutions we find the following non - vanishing components of the dual cft stress - energy tensor ( with @xmath147 ) @xmath148 -\\frac{8}{e^2 } \\frac { ( w_0 - 1)^2 w_0 ^ 2}{\\ell^3 } \\left ( \\begin{array}{cccc } 1&0&0&0 \\\\ 0&1&0&0 \\\\ 0&0&1&0 \\\\ 0&0&0&0 \\end{array } \\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have replaced @xmath149 @xcite , with @xmath150 the rank of the gauge group of the dual @xmath151 theory .",
    "the first three terms in this relation appear also for other known rotating solutions with equal magnitude angular momenta .",
    "the last term , however , is due to the existence of a non - abelian matter content in the bulk and implies a nonvanishing trace of the @xmath2 cft stress tensor , @xmath152 . from ( [ a0 ] ) , this can be written as @xmath153 , in agreement with the general results @xcite .",
