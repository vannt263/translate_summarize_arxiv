    ", the flux can vary on timescales as short as an hour or less ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "blazars exhibit a doubly - peaked spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , in which the low - energy component could extend from radio through uv or x - rays while the high - energy component extends from x - rays to @xmath0-rays .",
    "the low - frequency component of the sed is almost certainly due to synchrotron emission from nonthermal , ultra - relativistic electrons .",
    "the high - frequency component , on the other hand , is a result of inverse compton scattering of seed photons by the same ultra - relativistic electrons producing synchrotron emission ( in a leptonic jet scenario ) . in this case",
    ", the seed photons could be the synchrotron photons produced within the jet ( synchrotron self compton , ssc ) @xcite , and/or external photons entering the jet from outside ( the ec process ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the spectral variability patterns and seds are key ingredients in determining the acceleration of particles and the time - dependent interplay of various radiation mechanisms responsible for the observed emission .",
    "another defining characteristic of blazars is the high degree of linear polarization at optical wavelengths .",

    "bright @xmath0-ray source list @xcite have shown spectral and linear polarization variability @xcite .",
    "linear polarization at mm , ir , and optical wavelengths tends to exhibit similar position angles and sometimes correlation across these wavebands , often with some time delay @xcite .",
    "such correspondence between the variation in polarization and flux across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum , combined with vlbi imaging , can be used to identify the location of variable emission at all wavebands and shed light on the physical processes responsible for the variability @xcite .",
    "the blazar 3c  279 , located at a redshift of 0.538 @xcite , is one of the most prominent and well - studied blazars .",
    "this is due to its highly variable nature ( change in magnitude @xmath1 at optical bands ) at all wavelengths and high optical polarization up to 45.5% observed in the u band @xcite .",
    "intensive multiwavelength campaigns ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and theoretical efforts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) have led to some important conclusions about the physical properties of 3c  279 .",
    "chatterjee et al . ( 2008 ) showed that the flux variability in 3c  279 has been found to be significantly correlated at x - rays , optical r band , and 14.5 ghz wave bands , which also suggests that nearly all x - rays are produced in the jet .",
    "the x - ray flux has also been associated with superluminal knots , as suggested by correlation with the flux of the core region in the 43 ghz vlba images @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the nature and origin of its high - energy emission and the relationship of its behavior to the physical aspects of the jet remain elusive @xcite .",
    "in addition , the correspondence between high- and low - energy emission is also not very well understood .    here",
    ", we aim to understand the physical state of 3c  279 at different flux levels and look for a correspondence between the flux and polarization variation observed during the flaring state of november 2008 and quiescent state of may 2010 .",
    "this can be achieved by carrying out a detailed spectral analyses of 3c  279 under the internal shock scenario , and understanding the role of intrinsic parameters and interplay of synchrotron and inverse compton radiation processes in shaping the corresponding spectra of the two states .    as a first step toward comparing the physical state of 3c  279 at different flux levels , we use the multi - slice time - dependent leptonic jet model of joshi & bttcher ( 2011 ) ( in the framework of internal shock scenario ) with radiation feedback to simulate the sed of 3c  279 corresponding to the optical high state of early 2006 .",
    "the broadband emission of 3c  279 for this state indicates suppressed external compton emission , which makes it an ideal candidate for simulation using a synchrotron - ssc model .",
    "we use physical jet parameters obtained from the vlba monitoring to guide our modeling efforts and discuss the role of various intrinsic parameters and radiation processes in producing the resultant sed .",
    "we briefly describe the model of joshi & bttcher ( 2011 ) in  [ model ] .",

    "we summarize and give a brief description of future work in  [ summary ] .",
    "the mode of acceleration of particles to highly relativistic energies and its location in the jet is not yet completely understood . a colliding shell or",
    "an internal shock model offers a way to gain insight into the physics of particle acceleration . under this model",
    ", the central engine ( black hole + accretion disk ) is assumed to spew out shells of plasma with different velocity , mass , and energy . an inner shell , ejected at a later time , and travelling with a higher speed catches up to a slower moving outer shell that is ejected at an earlier time . the subsequent collision results in an emission region , as shown in figure [ emission_region ] , with two internal shocks ( reverse ( rs ) and forward ( fs ) ) separated by a contact discontinuity ( cd ) and traveling in opposite directions to each other in the frame of the shocked fluid .",
    "as the shocks propagate through the emission region , they convert the ordered bulk kinetic energy of the plasma into the magnetic field energy and random kinetic energy of the particles .",
    "the highly accelerated particles then radiate and produce the emission observed from the jet .",

    "such behavior poses a serious challenge to the single - zone leptonic jet model approach where the electron population is assumed to be homogeneous and is responsible for producing synchrotron emission as well as high - energy emission through inverse compton scattering @xcite .    in order to improve our insight into the behavior of 3c  279",
