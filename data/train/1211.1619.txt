    "@xcite provided new motivation for us to continue work on the nqa of calculating bound state properties .",
    "the discrepancy between the proton structure measured in hydrogen and that measured in muonic hydrogen has three possible causes , ( 1 ) new physics , ( 2 ) inadequate qed calculations , or ( 3 ) incorrect description of the interaction with the proton . to study ( 2 )",
    ", we are developing a new way to do the qed calculations . in this paper",
    "we introduce our new method of calculation , but do not carry the work to the level necessary to resolve the discrepancy found in the pohl , et al , and antognini , et al , experiments .",
    "other attempts to resolve the discrepancy can found from the citations to these articles .",
    "we cite one such calculation @xcite that also examines the second case . in this paper",
    "we present a one - loop calculation of the energy levels and wave functions of ordinary hydrogen and muonic hydrogen .",
    "the nqa , based on haag s expansion  @xcite of interacting fields in terms of asymptotic fields , also can be applied to other two - body systems , such as the @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems .",
    "haag s original expansion did not take account of bound states .",
    "we added _ in _ ( or _ out _ ) fields for each of the bound states that we take as stable in our approximate treatment .",
    "for the case of the hydrogen atom we add an _ in _ ( or _ out _ ) field for every state of the hydrogen atom .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to develop a new method of calculation of the energy levels and wave functions of relativistic bound states .",
    "this method has been described previously  @xcite , but it has not been developed sufficiently to account for high - order radiative and recoil effects that are relevant to the analysis of high - precision spectroscopic measurements , such as those in ordinary and muonic hydrogen . among the advantages of this method for ( 2-body )",
    "bound states such as the hydrogen atom are the introduction of both masses as independent parameters , rather than via the reduced mass . since we are interested in muonic hydrogen as well as ordinary hydrogen , taking the proton mass as an independent parameter is important .",
    "we also solve integral equations that incorporate radiative and recoil effects without perturbation theory .",
    "references to other applications of the nqa are in @xcite .",
    "of particular relevance to our present paper is @xcite , which is the first paper to give the spectator equation for a two - body bound state .",
    "there is related work by klln , @xcite , yang and feldman @xcite and , for bound states , by gross @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a one - loop approximation for the relativistic bound state that reduces to the dirac equation for large proton mass .",
    "as stated above , we introduce the proton mass as an independent parameter .",
    "this is relevant in the case of muonic hydrogen where the mass ratio @xmath2 rather than the ratio @xmath3 for ordinary hydrogen .",
    "we use the coulomb potential as the binding mechanism and ignore magnetic interactions and renormalization effects in this paper .",
    "we do not calculate energy levels in high accuracy in the present paper .",
    "rather , we describe our new method of calculation . in later papers , in addition to our systematic development of the nqa",
    ", we will give a unified calculation that includes all quantum electrodynamic corrections to the hydrogen spectrum up to a given order , rather than adding various corrections piece by piece . in our next paper",
    "we will pay particular attention to any differences between our results and the usual calculations to see whether this new method resolves the muonic hydrogen anomaly concerning the proton charge radius as inferred from measurements of the lamb shift in ordinary and muonic hydrogen .",
    "we will also find a set of coupled integral equations that include all terms up to a relevant order , rather that adding corrections term by term .",
    "the _ in _ ( _ out _ ) fields have free field commutators , obey free equations of motion , and the different _ in _ ( _ out _ ) fields commute or anticommute with each other everywhere in spacetime .",
    "each of these sets of asymptotic fields by themselves is completely known once the masses , spins , and quantum numbers of the fields in a given set are given .",
    "thus either set serves as a collection of standard building blocks to construct solutions of the operator equations of motion . for the present paper",
    "we ignore the difficulty that the asymptotic limits for the charged fields do not exist . in a recent paper",
    "@xcite we found modified charged fields for which the asymptotic limits do exist ; however we do not use the modified charged fields here .    to solve the equations of motion using the haag expansion , expand the fields that appear in the hamiltonian or lagrangian in normal - ordered series of _ in _ ( _ out _ ) fields . to determine the @xmath4-number amplitudes ( the haag amplitudes ) that are the coefficients of the normal - ordered terms , insert the expansion in the operator equations of motion , renormal - order , and equate the coefficients of corresponding ( linearly independent ) normal - ordered terms .",
    "the relevant haag amplitudes are the wave functions of the bound states .",
    "the method based on the haag expansion is entirely independent of the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the bethe - salpeter approach , in the nqa there are no spurious solutions and no negative norm amplitudes .",
    "the nqa can be used for bound states in relativistic theories even though the amplitudes depend only on the same number of kinematic variables as nonrelativistic wave functions . in particular",
    ", there are no relative times in the relativistic version of the nqa . with all terms in the @xmath5 field expansions allowed by conservation laws",
    ", the haag expansion should be equivalent to the interacting field theory .",
    "this results in an infinite set of coupled equations . to get a tractable set of equations , we terminate the haag expansions , keeping a finite set of terms for each interacting field . for quantum electrodynamics , the case relevant here",
    ", the smallness of @xmath6 provides a rationale to terminate the series ; each vertex has a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "for this paper we restrict to the simplest terms in the haag expansion that give an equation for the bound state .    we need not construct the @xmath5 field for the bound state .",
    "we assume possible bound states and introduce @xmath5 fields , characterized by their mass , spin , and other quantum numbers , for each .",
    "the equations of motion for the interacting fields give equations for the bound state amplitudes ; if there is a solution for a given bound state amplitude , then the corresponding bound state exists .",
    "we take `` bound state amplitude '' as a synonym for `` wave function . ''",

    "we excluded momenta close to infinity to avoid infinities in our discretized integral equation .",

    "we used an approximation to get the final form of the equations used in these numerical calculations .",
    "this approximation obscures the mass interchange symmetry , but it should still be present to some degree . to check this , we interchanged masses and calculated a few of the eigenvalues for electronic hydrogen , where the mass interchange creates more of a drastic change to the equations than in muonic hydrogen .",

    "we also found evidence that our precision is not high enough for the final terms in eq . and eq .",

    "+   +    in addition to eigenvalues , we compared our wave functions with dirac equation solutions .",
    "specifically , we compared the momentum space radial wave function of the upper components of the dirac equation solutions with our function @xmath185 .",

    "comparisons for two states are shown in figure [ fig : wavefunctions ] .",
    "plots on the left hand side are the nqa wave functions as a function of @xmath186 for three electronic and muonic hydrogen states .",
    "plots on the right hand side are differences between the nqa wave functions and dirac - coulomb wave functions for the same electronic and muonic hydrogen states .",
    "we plotted the muonic and electronic wave functions and differences for each state on the same set of axes in order to make direct comparisons between electronic and muonic hydrogen . as is the case for dirac - coulomb wave functions ,",
    "nqa muonic wave functions are larger for smaller momenta and smaller for large momenta than their electronic counterparts .",
    "it is clear from the right plots that muonic hydrogen wave functions are more consistent with dirac - coulomb wave functions .",
    "the nqa solutions are less than the dirac wave functions for small momenta and greater for larger momenta .",
    "the differences shown on the right in figure [ fig : wavefunctions ] are small compared to the size of the wave functions themselves , therefore we can conclude that we have found wave functions that are fairly consistent with dirac wave functions , as well as eigenvalues that are all within 2 sigmas except for the @xmath187 state .",
    "it is worth noting that we introduced the heavy particle mass independently in the nqa equations , yet the results compare nicely with dirac equation results with the reduced mass .",
    "in this section , we show how to calculate higher order contributions to the bound state energy , specifically lamb shift terms .",
    "the actual calculation of these terms is beyond the scope of this paper , but we will explain how to extend our formalism to include the corrections .",
    "the usual diagrams used to calculate the lamb shift perturbatively are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the energy contributions of these diagrams are typically calculated with respect to zeroth order wave functions of solutions to equations such as eq .",
    "( [ eq : bse ] ) .",
    "we intend to calculate the analogs of these diagrams within the framework of the nqa .",
    "we can incorporate these terms in our integral equations and use the numerical techniques described above to find a less perturbative solution .",
    "three examples of nqa lamb shift diagrams are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the external off - shell line at the lower left of each diagram is assumed to be the electron .",
    "these terms will be added to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bse1 ] ) . in any diagram , every loop that does not contain an nqa amplitude must have one on - shell line . with this rule",
    ", there are 2 permutations of the vacuum polarization diagram , 3 of the anomalous magnetic moment diagram , and 2 of the mass renormalization diagram .",
    "the diagrams shown in figure 5 involve the amplitude @xmath188 , but there are similar diagrams involving @xmath189 where the line directly to the lower left of the circle is the on - shell line and the line directly to the circle s lower right is off - shell .",
    "this means that there are a total of 4 diagrams for vacuum polarization , 6 for the anomalous magnetic moment , and 4 for mass renormalization .",
    "we also must find similar diagrams to add to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bse2 ] ) where the external off - shell line is the proton .",
    "the nqa seems to be more complicated than the standard procedure where there is only 1 feynman diagram for each lamb shift contribution , but diagrams of the same type are very similar and it is not necessary to calculate each diagram explicitly .",
    "additionally , the mass shell delta functions that appear in the nqa simplify calculations .",
    "we used the n - quantum approach ( nqa ) in one - loop order to calculate the energy levels and bound - state amplitudes of ordinary and muonic hydrogen and of positronium .",
    "we can treat other two - body systems , such as the ( @xmath190 ) system and the ( @xmath191 ) system , in an analogous way .",
    "we used the nqa systematically to find a relation between wave functions with the light particle off - shell and the heavy particle off - shell and to find normalization conditions for our amplitudes .",
    "in future work we will derive integral equations that include higher - order corrections .",
    "we will solve these equations numerically without using perturbation theory in order to include some of the energy correction terms that are usually calculated perturbatively .",
    "we will compute the lamb shift and the hyperfine structure of both electronic and muonic hydrogen .",
    "we plan to carry these calculations to sufficient order to compare our results with the usual methods to see if our methods resolve the muonic hydrogen anomaly .",
