    "at long distances the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction can be written as ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) @xmath0 where , @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent the one pion exchange ( ope ) and the two pion exchange ( tpe ) contributions to the potential , respectively .",
    "up to power corrections in the distance @xmath3 , one has @xmath4 .",
    "such an expansion makes sense , since there is a clear scale separation at long distances .",
    "actually , the omitted terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : full_pot ] ) represent contributions whose ranges are shorter than @xmath5 . these include three and higher pion exchanges , correlated meson exchanges , etc  @xcite . in momentum space , the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : full_pot ] ) parallels an expansion on leading low momentum singularities , rather than a naive low momentum expansion .",
    "the systematic and model independent determination of those potentials was suggested several years ago  @xcite and pursued by many others  @xcite ( for some reviews emphasizing different viewpoints see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . however , in any scheme the potentials in eq .",
    "( [ eq : full_pot ] ) become singular at short distances , so one must truncate or renormalize the potential in a physically meaningful way in order to predict finite and unique phase shifts and deuteron properties .",
    "this has been a subject of much debate and controversy in recent times and we refer the interested reader to the literature for further details  @xcite .    in previous works by two of us ( mpv and era )  @xcite the renormalization of nn potentials was studied using chiral potentials based on the heavy baryon formalism ( hb-@xmath6pt )  @xcite . in the present paper , we extend those ideas to the case where lorentz - invariant chiral potentials are used instead . in this case , the relativistic framework of baryon chiral perturbation theory ( rb-@xmath6pt ) proposed by becher and leutwyler  @xcite is employed in the construction of the two - pion exchange ( tpe ) component of the nn interaction .",
    "the remarkable difference between hb- and rb - tpe potentials lies on the long distance behavior  @xcite , due to the analytic structure of the @xmath7 scattering amplitude in the low energy region where the mandelstam variable @xmath8 is close to @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the pion mass . actually , one appealing feature of the rb - tpe potentials is that the long - distance two pion effects are correctly described , so that important contributions at the exponential level @xmath11 are properly re - summed , unlike its heavy baryon counterpart . in this work",
    "we are also interested on its different short distance behavior , which plays an important role on the renormalization program of the nn interaction developed in refs .",
    "we disregard , however , explicit @xmath12 s ( see e.g. @xcite ) and other intermediate state contributions , assuming that those degrees of freedom have been integrated out .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the calculation of scattering and bound state properties requires specifying the nn potential at short distances , which turns out to be highly singular for the lorentz - invariant case .",
    "actually , a crucial issue in the present context regards the number of necessary counter - terms required by the renormalizability of the s - matrix . in the single channel situation , the results found in refs .",
    "@xcite in configuration space can be summarized as follows .",
    "if the potential is a regular one , i.e. , @xmath13 , there is freedom to _ choose _ between the regular and irregular solution of the corresponding schrdinger equation .",
    "in the first case the scattering length is predicted , while in the second case the scattering length becomes an input of the calculation .",
    "singular potentials fulfill @xmath14 the scattering length is _ predicted _ while for attractive singular potentials [ @xmath15 the scattering length _ must _ be given .",
    "the case @xmath16 is very special and , for @xmath17 , yields ultraviolet limit - cycles  @xcite .",
    "for coupled channels one must diagonalize first the coupled channel potentials and apply the single channel rules to the outgoing eigenpotentials .    in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding",
    "we hasten to emphasize that our use of the word relativistic is in a narrow sense ; we are only disregarding a naive heavy baryon expansion of the virtual nucleon states in the calculation of the potential and hence taking into account important anomalous thresholds singularities  @xcite .",
    "this is _ not the same _ as providing a fully relativistic quantum field theoretical solution to the the two - body problem by say , solving a bethe - salpeter equation or any two body relativistic equation .",
    "this has always been a problem rooted in the non - perturbative divorce between crossing and unitarity in few body calculations for which the present paper has nothing to say .",

    "already the rb - tpe potential displays a relativistic @xmath36 van der waals singularity at the origin .",
    "thus , the discussion on whether or not the deuteron parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be fixed independently on the potential depends on the short distance behaviour of the eigenvalues of the coupled channel potential matrix . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite also for the bound state case the number of independent parameters coincides with the number of negative ( attractive ) eigenpotentials at short distances . in the rb - tpe potential",
    "we are using here  @xcite we have only one independent parameter ( see table  [ tab : table2 ] ) which we take to be @xmath37 or , equivalently , the deuteron binding energy .",
    "with such a choice @xmath38 becomes a prediction in contrast to the hb - tpe where @xmath38 is an input .",
    "the outgoing deuteron wave functions are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : u+w_tpe ] for the rb - tpe potential and compared to the hb - tpe one .",
    "let us analyze in more detail the cut - off dependence of observables in the present rb - tpe potential .",
    "given the fact that in the @xmath39 coupled channel we have one attractive and one repulsive eigenpotential at short distances we may borrow from the previous discussion on ope  @xcite where we refer for further details .",
    "the practical way of introducing in this case a short distance cut - off @xmath40 which selects the regular solution at the origin is by appropriately choosing the auxiliary boundary condition at the point @xmath41 among many possible choices compatible with self - adjointness  @xcite .",
    "the precise choice may provide smoother limits and hence better convergence properties in the pre - asymptotic region .",
    "actually , as we show in appendix  [ finite - cut - off ] , we can estimate the size of the finite cut - off corrections in deuteron observables and hence their convergence rate towards the corresponding renormalized values .",
    "the result is that up to some oscillations the convergence towards the renormalized value is exponential as @xmath42 , i.e. the convergence towards the renormalized value is @xmath43 $ ] for the rb - tpe potential ( @xmath44 ) as compared to @xmath45 $ ] for the ope potential ( @xmath46 ) . here",
    "@xmath47 is a characteristic short distance scale of the corresponding repulsive eigenpotentials .",
    "the analysis of appendix  [ finite - cut - off ] also shows that , generally , the more singular the potential the faster the convergence .    for illustration purposes we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta - rc ] the calculated asymptotic d / s ratio of the deuteron wave function , @xmath38 , as a function of the short distance cut - off @xmath40 ( in @xmath48 ) for the rb - tpe potential when the auxiliary boundary conditions @xmath49 and @xmath50 are considered .",
    "note the clear and coincident plateau below @xmath51 for both boundary conditions following a relatively rapid variation above this region   or @xmath52 not shown in the figure make the oscillations deduced in appendix  [ finite - cut - off ] more visible , but the plateau region takes place also below @xmath51 and yields an identical numerical result as with @xmath53 and @xmath50 . ] . as mentioned above ,",
    "this is a typical feature of a coupled channel singular potential with one attractive and one repulsive eigenpotential which extends to all other deuteron properties . actually , the situation strongly resembles the previously studied ope potential which has a softer @xmath54 singularity at the origin  @xcite ; the main difference is that for ope stability takes place at a shorter scale , @xmath55 , than in rb - tpe potential . in the present context",
    "it is also helpful to remind that a short distance cut - off radius and a sharp momentum cut - off are inverse proportional to each other , @xmath56  @xcite ( the numerical coefficient depends on the particular regularization ) . thus plotting observables as a function of @xmath40 enhances the finite cut - off changes while long plateaus could be observed instead as functions of @xmath57",
    "actually , halving the short distance cut - off corresponds to doubling the momentum space cut - off .",
    "for instance , in rb ( set-@xmath38 ) the range @xmath58 corresponds to the range @xmath59 where observables such as @xmath38 change less than @xmath60 . pinning down",
    "this error bar would be harder if the sharp or other momentum space cut - off was used .",
    "our results for several deuteron properties are shown in table  [ tab : table3 ] and compared to the corresponding hb - tpe considered in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "some remarks concerning the errors quoted in table  [ tab : table3 ] are in order .",
    "we provide the largest source of error in the calculation which we are able to quantify .",
    "since we aim at renormalized results , we stop whenever the change of the cut - off causes no significant variation within a prescribed accuracy , which we take to be about an order of magnitude higher than the typical experimental or recommended value uncertainty .",
    "thus , the cut - off range is not necessarily the same in all cases . in general terms , the more singular the potential at short distance , the faster the convergence of the result towards the renormalized limit ( see e.g. appendix  [ finite - cut - off ] ) .",
    "thus , the toughest case is ope , where we only have @xmath54 singularity . convergence in this case is the slowest , therefore shorter cut - offs @xmath61 are needed .",
    "the value we obtain for @xmath38 for the parameter sets of table  [ tab : table1 ] is slightly different from the experimental one , making the comparison with the hb - tpe case  @xcite , where @xmath38 was a free parameter ( two attractive short distance eigenpotentials ) , a bit misleading . in order to obtain an accurate value of @xmath38 it was necessary to readjust the low energy parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 to the values @xmath64 and @xmath65 , indeed , very similar to the values proposed by other authors  @xcite",
    "( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "actually , once we have reproduced @xmath38 we see a general and slight improvement in accuracy when going from the hb - tpe ( where @xmath38 is a free parameter ) of our previous work  @xcite to the present rb - tpe calculation ( where @xmath38 is predicted ) .",
    "basically , rb - tpe produces a sharp prediction for @xmath38 ( with eventually no errors ) , whereas hb - tpe does not predict @xmath38 , so its @xmath66 experimental uncertainty propagates to other deuteron observables at about a similar @xmath66 level , which is still comparable or larger than the error in the quoted experimental or recommended values . the conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite was that agreement was partly achieved because of this fuzziness in the theoretical predictions .",
    "of course , one should not overstress the possible accuracy of the present results as regards the systematic errors ; the main point of our calculation is to provide the general picture when more complete asymptotic tpe effects are correctly taken into account",
    ".     +   +   +     +   +   +   +",
    "we come to the calculation of the np phase shifts . in practice , this requires a careful wave by wave study of the renormalized limit .",
    "as can be seen in table  [ tab : table2 ] , all coupled triplet channels have one attractive and one repulsive short distance @xmath36 eigenpotential . on the other hand , almost all singlet and uncoupled triplet channels develop an attractive @xmath36 singularity at short distances ( sometimes depending on the parameter values ) .",
    "the only exceptions we found are the @xmath67 and @xmath68 channels , the latter depending on the precise values of the @xmath69 constants of the chiral potential .",
    "this fact determines not only the number of counterterms , but also the convergence pattern towards the renormalized result .",
    "it reaches stability for cut - offs ranging in the region @xmath70 , depending on the particular partial wave and also on the energy ( see the discussion in the previous section [ sec : deuteron ] and appendix  [ finite - cut - off ] ) .",
    "phase shifts in coupled channels with one repulsive singular component have been computed with either auxiliary boundary conditions @xmath71 and @xmath72 for zero energy states and subsequent orthogonalization of the finite energy states by using a complementary boundary condition as described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite for the ope case .",
    "it is important to realize that even though renormalization requires in principle to pursue the mathematical limit @xmath42 , convergence is achieved in practice by length scales which are not unrealistically small and in fact are rather reasonable .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps - running ] where , for illustration purposes , some selected low phases are depicted as a function of the short distance cut - off for fixed laboratory energy values .",
    "as one generally expects smaller values of @xmath40 are needed as the energy is increased .",
    "the approach towards the renormalized value for any partial wave depends on the attractive / repulsive character of the singular potential at short distances .",
    "so , the @xmath73 and @xmath68 channels are purely attractive and hence the finite cut - off corrections are @xmath74 up to oscillations  @xcite . on the other hand , the @xmath67 channel provides a repulsive case and hence finite cut - off corrections are @xmath75 .",
    "we remind that the smallest de broglie wavelength probed in nn interaction below pion production threshold is @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the rb - potential and the present renormalization construction also implement the desirable _ a priori _ requirement that short distance details are indeed irrelevant for the description of low energy properties .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : cmp - uncoupled ] and [ fig : cmp - coupled ] we present the np ( sym - nuclear bar ) renormalized phase shifts for the total angular momentum @xmath77 for spin singlet and uncoupled spin triplet and coupled spin triplet channels respectively .",
    "there we compare the relativistic baryon expansion ( rbe ) and the heavy baryon expansion ( hbe ) as a function of the lab energy compared to the nijmegen partial wave analysis  @xcite .",
    "for definiteness we use the chiral constants @xmath78 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 of ref .  @xcite ( set iv ) , which already provided a good description of deuteron properties after renormalization  @xcite at nnlo .",
    "this choice allows a more straightforward comparison to the n@xmath79lo calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite with finite cut - offs .",
    "we also compare with the set @xmath38 which takes to the same value of @xmath78 and the readjusted values @xmath80 and @xmath81 based on our improved description of the deuteron in sec .",
    "[ sec : deuteron ] . unless otherwise stated , the needed low energy parameters for these figures are _ always _ taken to be those of ref .",
    "@xcite for the nijmii potential ( see table  [ tab : table2 ] ) . as can be clearly seen , the rb - tpe with this set-@xmath38 not only improves deuteron properties but also the phase shifts all over .",
    "again , one should not overemphasize this agreement , but it is rewarding to see that there is a general trend to stability and improvement in some channels ( such as @xmath82,@xmath83 , @xmath68 ) when the rb - tpe potential is considered , while the quality of description is not worsened in other channels . at the same time one should stress , however , that generally speaking this potential needs much less counter - terms as the corresponding hb counterpart ( about a half ) .",
    "actually , in the lorentz - invariant potential case one has at most one free parameter for channel as compared to the three parameters for channels in the coupled triplets .",
    "this is due to the attractive - repulsive short distance character of the coupled channel rb - tpe as compared to the attractive - attractive hb - tpe potential in these coupled channels .",
    "again , we remind that the rb - tpe provides the correct analytic behavior of the exchange of two pions at large distances when @xmath12 and other excitations are not explicitly considered .",
    "in the present paper we have analyzed the renormalization of all partial waves for nn scattering and the bound deuteron state for the chiral two pion exchange potential computed in a relativistic baryon expansion .",
    "our main motivation has been to consider a potential where the asymptotic tpe effects are consistently taken care of .",
    "this gives us some confidence that long distance physics is faithfully represented by a common exponential fall - off factor @xmath84 . at the level of calculation considered here @xmath12 and other excitations are not explicitly taken into account ; within a relativistic baryon expansion the contribution of this degree of freedom to the nn potential has never been computed .",
    "in addition , in the relativistic baryon expansion there appear non - local terms in the potential which involve the sum of initial and final momentum space operators which fortunately turn out to be rather small all over the range as compared to the local contributions to the potential .",
    "this simplifies the analysis tremendously since standard coordinate space methods can be used to solve the non - perturbative scattering problem and deuteron bound state and their subsequent and necessary renormalization . as we have repeatedly stressed along the paper",
    "this lorentz - invariant potential presents a @xmath36 singularity at the origin which demands renormalization in order to get a finite and unique result when the tpe potential is assumed to be valid all over the range from the origin to infinity .",
    "this can be done by introducing a number of ( potential independent ) counter - terms and consequently physical renormalization conditions must be specified . in practice",
    "they are fixed to the values of threshold parameters , mainly scattering lengths at zero energy .",
    "actually , we have noted that the number of necessary counter - terms is drastically reduced when the lorentz - invariant baryon potential is compared to the heavy baryon expanded tpe potential , while both potentials are specified by the same parameters .",
    "thus , less input is needed to predict the nn phase - shifts .",
    "although the precise number of counter - terms depends on the parameters of the potential we find that , typically , for the channels with total angular momentum @xmath85 to @xmath86 we need 13 in the lorentz - invariant case as compared to about 27 in the hb potential .",
    "actually , it is noteworthy that with about a half of the counter - terms the overall agreement is improved .",
    "this is particularly striking in the @xmath68 and the @xmath39 ( deuteron ) channels .",
    "in other channels the improvement is moderate , indicating missing shorter range contributions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : full_pot ] ) .",
    "although a deeper understanding on why this dramatic reduction of the number of counter - terms happens would very helpful , and we have not attempted a large scale fit , it is very rewarding that the implementation of the correct and fairly complete long range physics deduced from one and two pion exchange in conjunction with the requirement of renormalizability provides a rather reasonable description of the nn scattering data below pion production threshold .",
