    "charged particles , accelerated to the speeds exceeding local thermal velocity , play a vital role in numerous laboratory , space , solar and astrophysical interdisciplinary processes . for example , in space plasmas , the van allen radiation belts form a torus of energetic charged plasma particles around earth , which is held in place by earth s magnetic field .",
    "these accelerated , charged particles come from cosmic rays .",
    "the radiation belts pose serious hazard to the space technology and future manned space travel . the outer electron radiation belt is mostly produced by the inward radial diffusion @xcite and local acceleration @xcite due to transfer of energy from whistler mode plasma waves to radiation belt electrons .",
    "dispersive alfven waves ( daws ) are known to accelerate electrons in the earth auroral zone @xcite . in solar coronal plasmas ,",
    "solar flare models involve magnetic reconnection which converts the magnetic energy into heat and kinetic energy of accelerated particles . about 50 - 80% of the energy released during solar flares",
    "is converted into the energy of accelerated particles @xcite .",
    "thus , knowledge of the details of particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection ( which is deemed a major mechanism operating solar and stellar flares ) is of great importance .",
    "this is of direct relevance to the solar activity that affects humankind via hazardous phenomena such as solar flares and energetic particles . in astrophysical plasmas ,",
    "accelerated particles play a major role in explaining the existence of soft excess emission originating from clusters of galaxies that is of fundamental cosmological importance @xcite .",
    "also , multi - wavelength observations of active galactic nuclei have now provided evidence that they are site of production of high temperature plasmas ( @xmath11 mev ) with strong tails of accelerated particles .",
    "the generation of hot , relativistic plasmas and accelerated particles is a challenging problem both in the context of active galactic nuclei and the origin of high - energy cosmic rays @xcite . in laboratory plasmas , in the case of ions ,",
    "plasma regimes in which enhanced fast - ion transport occurs because of strongly driven energetic particle models ( epms ) should be avoided in order to reach reactor relevant performance and prevent first wall damage @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the transition from regimes characterised by weakly driven modes ( such as alfven eigenmodes , e.g. toroidal alfven eigenmodes , taes ) to regimes dominated by strongly driven modes ( like epms ) and the determination of the related threshold are then of crucial importance for burning plasma operations @xcite . in the case of electrons ,",
    "e.g. in the laser driven inertial confinement fusion , accelerated electrons carry away a lot of energy pumped by the laser .",
    "also , due to the laser s strong coupling with hot electrons , premature heating of the dense plasma ( ions ) is problematic and fusion yields are low .",
    "significant improvements in the modelling of these phenomena have been achieved @xcite .",
    "edge localised modes ( elms ) are mhd instabilities destabilised by the pressure gradient in the h - mode tokamak edge pedestal .",
    "elms produce losses of up to 10% plasma energy in several 100 micro - seconds .",
    "elms are major concern for the operation of iter .",
    "thus , elm control is essential .",
    "elms are the focus of increasing attention by the edge physics community because of the potential impact that the large divertor heat pulses due to elms would have on the divertor design of future high power tokamaks such as iter .",
    "ref.@xcite reviews what is known about elms , with an emphasis on their effect on the scrape - off layer and divertor plasmas .",
    "elm effects have been measured in the asdex - u , c - mod , compass - d , dili - d , jet , jft-2 m , jt-60u and tcv tokamaks , and were reported by ref.@xcite .",
    "elms are known to produce super - thermal particle fluxes that are damaging for tokamak wall materials .    at the beginning of the previous paragraph ,",
    "interdisciplinary nature of the role of accelerated particles was emphasised . in all of the above mentioned fields of research ,",
    "the mechanisms that lead to accelerated particles are in fact common , and can be split into three broad classes : ( 1 ) electric field acceleration ; ( 2 ) shock acceleration and ( 3 ) stochastic acceleration .    in the electric field acceleration mechanism ,",
    "ref.@xcite considered dynamics of electrons under the action of two effects : the parallel ( to background magnetic field ) electric field and friction between electrons and ions .",
    "the equation describing electron motion along the magnetic field is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the electron drift velocity , @xmath14 is the electron - ion collision frequency and dot denotes time derivative . in the limiting case of @xmath15 and the steady state regime ,",
    "the equation of motion allows one to obtain the expression for spitzer resistivity . in the limit of @xmath16 ,",
    "the steady state solution is not possible .",
    "this is because when the right hand side of the equation is positive i.e. when @xmath17 , one has electron acceleration .",
    "the latter leads to the so - called run - away regime .",
    "the acceleration due to the parallel electric field leads to an increase in the electron drift speed @xmath13 , in turn , this leads to a decrease in @xmath14 because @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , when the electric field exceeds the critical value @xmath19 ( so - called dreicer electric field ) , the faster electron motion leads to the decrease in electron - ion friction , which in turn results in even faster motion . as a result",
    "the run - away regime is reached . for electric fields",
    "less than the dreicer field , the rate of acceleration is less than the rate of collision losses and only a small fraction of the particles can be accelerated into a non - thermal tail of energy @xmath20 @xcite , where @xmath21 is the acceleration lengthscale .",
    "super - dreicer fields , which seem to be present in many simulations of reconnection @xcite , accelerate particles at a rate that is faster than the collision or thermalisation time .",
    "this can lead to a runaway and an unstable electron distribution which , as shown theoretically , by laboratory experiments and by the simulations @xcite , will give rise to plasma waves or turbulence @xcite .    in shock acceleration mechanism , which is also called first - order fermi acceleration , the fractional momentum gain , @xmath22 , per shock",
    "crossing is linear in the velocity ratio , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are shock and particle speeds respectively . in stochastic acceleration mechanism , which is also called second - order fermi acceleration , particles of velocity @xmath25 moving along magnetic field lines with a pitch angle @xmath26 undergo random scattering by moving agents with a velocity @xmath27 .",
    "because the head collisions ( that are energy gaining ) are more probable than trailing collisions ( that are energy losing ) , on average , the particles gain momentum at a rate proportional to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the pitch angle diffusion rate .",
    "note that here dependence on the velocity ratio is quadratic ( hence the name second order ) @xcite .    in this work",
    "we focus on the electric field acceleration mechanism .",
    "in particular when the electric field is provided by the daws . in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) regime alfven waves ( aws ) can not provide parallel electric fields , therefore can not accelerate particles via the electric field acceleration mechanism .",
    "after it was realised @xcite that in the kinetic regime ( in which plasma is treated as a collection of charged particles , rather than a fluid as in mhd ) aws with parallel electric fields are possible , a significant effort has been undertaken to study these waves . in laboratory plasmas , an externally applied oscillating magnetic field ( at a frequency near 1 mhz for typical tokamak parameters ) was found to resonantly mode convert to a kinetic aw , whose perpendicular wavelength is comparable to the ion gyroradius @xcite .",
    "the kinetic aw , while it propagates into the higher - density side of the plasma after mode conversion , dissipates due to both linear and nonlinear processes and heats the plasma .",
    "if a magnetic field of 50 g effective amplitude is applied , approximately 10 mj m@xmath30 of energy can be deposited in 1 sec into the plasma . in space",
    "plasmas , surface waves , excited either by a mhd plasma instability or an externally applied impulse , were shown to convert in a resonant mode to a kinetic aw having a wavelength comparable to the ion gyroradius in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the kinetic aw was found to have a component of its electric field in the direction of the ambient magnetic field and can accelerate plasma particles along the field line . a possible relation between this type of acceleration and the formation of auroral arcs",
    "was discussed @xcite . in solar coronal plasmas , it was found that an alfven surface wave can be excited by 300 s period chromospheric oscillations which then resonantly excite kinetic aws .",
    "because of their kinetic structure , the latter waves were found to dissipate their energy efficiently @xcite .",
    "the parallel electric field is also produced when low frequency ( @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the ion cyclotron frequency ) dispersive aw has a wavelength perpendicular to the background magnetic field comparable to any of the kinetic spatial scales such as : ion gyroradius at electron temperature , @xmath33 , ion thermal gyroradius , @xmath34 , @xcite or to electron inertial length @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the central issue in understanding what physical effect(s ) can provide the parallel electric field can be understood based on the two - fluid theory of dispersive aws @xcite .",
    "the electron equation of motion , @xmath36 , indicates that in the linear regime , @xmath37 can be supported either by the electron inertia term , @xmath38 , or the electron pressure tensor term , @xmath39 .",
    "dispersive alfven waves are subdivided into inertial aws or kinetic aws depending on the relation between the plasma @xmath40 and electron / ion mass ratio @xmath41 . when @xmath42 ( i.e. when alfven speed is much greater than electron and ion thermal speeds , @xmath43 ) dominant mechanism for sustaining @xmath37 is the parallel electron inertia ( that is why such waves are called inertial aws ) . when @xmath44 , ( i.e. when @xmath45 ) then clearly thermal effects become important .",
    "thus , the dominant mechanism for sustaining @xmath37 is the parallel electron pressure gradient ( that is why such waves are called kinetic aws - kinetic motion of electrons is the source of pressure ) . in the mhd regime",
    ", it has been known that the phase - mixing mechanism , in which an aw moves along the density inhomogeneity that is transverse to the background magnetic field , can provide a fast dissipation mechanism . fast in a sense that aw amplitude decrease , as a function of travel distance , @xmath46 , along wave propagation direction , is a much faster function of @xmath46 , @xmath47 $ ] , compared to the usual resistive damping law @xmath48 $ ] , where @xmath49 is the plasma resistivity and @xmath50 denotes spatial derivative of the alfven speed in the transverse to the background magnetic field direction .",
    "the fast dissipation occurs because the phase mixing effect leads to the build - up of sharp gradients in the alfven wave front , in the transverse to its propagation direction .",
    "it has been recently discovered in the solar coronal context that when the phase - mixing mechanism is considered in the kinetic regime , electrons can be effectively accelerated by the phase - mixed dispersive aw .",
    "it was found that when dispersive aw moves in the transversely inhomogeneous plasma , parallel electric field is generated in the regions of plasma inhomogeneity .",
    "this electric field can effectively accelerate electrons for a wide range of plasma parameters @xcite .",
    "it turns out that similar electron acceleration mechanism has been also found in the earth magnetosphere context @xcite .",
    "see also ref . for the cross - comparison .",
    "the difference is that ref .",
    "have studied the case of plasma over - density , transverse to the background magnetic field , whereas ref . considered the case of plasma under - density ( a cavity ) , as dictated by the different applications considered ( solar coronal loops and earth auroral plasma cavities ) . ref.@xcite studied the kinetic - scale alfven wave phase mixing at the boundaries of the density cavity , the strongly varying alfven speed profile above the earth auroral ionosphere ( so - called ionospheric alfven resonator ) , which leads to the development of the parallel electric fields that accelerate electrons in the aurora .",
    "they performed simulations to study the evolution of these fields including both parallel and perpendicular inhomogeneity .",
    "calculations of ref.@xcite , based on the linear kinetic theory of alfven waves , also indicate that landau damping of these waves can efficiently convert the poynting flux into field - aligned acceleration of electrons .",
    "more recently , an analytical theory has been developed to explain the numerical simulations presented in ref .. also , a possibility of acceleration of electrons by inertial aws has been explored in a one dimensional , homogeneous plasma case ( without phase mixing ) @xcite .",
    "the latter extended and adopted for solar coronal context earlier work of ref.@xcite who demonstrated the fermi - like acceleration by inertial alfven waves of a small proportion of electrons , up to speeds of twice the alfven speed and argued that this is a plausible scenario for auroral electron acceleration .",
    "the effect of the hall term on the phase mixing of aws has been studied in ref ..    this work aims to fill the gap in understanding of particle acceleration by dispersive alfven waves in the transversely inhomogeneous plasma via full kinetic simulation particularly focusing on the effect of polarisation of the waves and different regimes ( inertial of kinetic ) .",
    "in particular , we study particle acceleration by the low frequency ( @xmath51 ) daws , similar to considered in ref . ,",
    "but here we focus on the effect of the wave polarisation , left- ( l- ) and right- ( r- ) circular and elliptical , in the different regimes inertial ( @xmath52 ) and kinetic ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the primary goal is to study the latter effects on the efficiency of particle acceleration and the parallel electric field generation .",
    "we use epoch ( extendible open pic collaboration ) a multi - dimensional , fully electromagnetic , relativistic particle - in - cell code which was developed and is used by engineering and physical sciences research council ( epsrc)-funded collaborative computational plasma physics ( ccpp ) consortium of 30 uk researchers .",
    "we use 2.5d version of the epoch code which means that we have two spatial component along @xmath46- and @xmath54-axis and there are three @xmath55 particle velocity components present ( for electrons and ions ) .",
    "the relativistic equations of motion are solved for each individual plasma particle .",
    "the code also solves maxwell s equations , with self - consistent currents , using the full component set of em fields @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "epoch uses un - normalised si units , however , in order for our results to be general , we use the normalisation for the graphical presentation of the results as follows .",
    "distance and time are normalised to @xmath58 and @xmath59 , while electric and magnetic fields to @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "note that when visualising the normalised results we use @xmath62 m@xmath30 in the least dense parts of the domain ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) , which are located at the lowermost and uppermost edges of the simulation domain ( i.e. fix @xmath65 hz radian on the domain edges ) . here",
    "@xmath66 is the electron plasma frequency , @xmath67 is the number density of species @xmath68 and all other symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "the spatial dimension of the simulation box are varied as @xmath69 and @xmath70 grid points for the mass ratio @xmath7 , and @xmath71 and @xmath70 grid points for the mass ratio @xmath72 which represents 1/25th of the actual @xmath73 of 1836 .",
    "the choice of the mass ratio @xmath74 is motivated by following reasons : ( i ) since the daws considered in this study are essentially alfvenic ( for the fixed throughout this paper value of @xmath75 there is very little difference between alfven branch with @xmath76 and l- and r- circularly polarised daw branches that propagate along the magnetic field , see e.g. fig .",
    "3.4 from ref.@xcite ) , as the alfven seed @xmath77 scales as @xmath78 the actual alfven wave would be 5 times slower than considered here ; ( ii ) @xmath74 value lands us in the kinetic regime because plasma beta in this study is fixed at @xmath79 . thus @xmath80 ; ( iii ) this is the maximal value that can be considered with the available computational resources  using 32 dual quad - core xeon @xmath81 processor cores .",
    "a typical with @xmath72 run takes 48 hours on 256 processors .",
    "the grid unit size is @xmath82 . here",
    "@xmath83 is the debye length ( @xmath84 is electron thermal speed ) .",
    "we use 100 electrons and 100 ions per cell which means that for @xmath7 there are @xmath85 and for @xmath72 there are @xmath86 particles in the simulation box .",
    "plasma number density @xmath87 ( and hence @xmath88 ) can be regarded as arbitrary , because we wish our results to stay general .",
    "we impose constant background magnetic field @xmath89 gauss along @xmath46-axis .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath90 , so that with the normalisation used for the visualisation purposes , normalised background magnetic field is unity .",
    "this fixes @xmath91 .",
    "electron and ion temperature at the simulation box edge is also fixed at @xmath92k .",
    "this in conjunction with @xmath93 m@xmath30 makes plasma parameters similar to that of a dense flaring loops in the solar corona .",
    "for example radiative hydrodynamic modelling of the bastille - day solar flare by ref .",
    "( see their fig.1b and 1c ) indicate loop apex temperatures and densities as @xmath94k and @xmath95 m@xmath30 respectively .",
    "this is consonant with our overall goal to provide a viable , fully - kinetic model for particle acceleration by means of daws during solar flares to alleviate so called `` number - problem '' .",
    "the latter refers to the too high total number ( @xmath96 per second ) of accelerated electrons required to produce the observed hard x - ray emission compared to that available in the corona , if the particle acceleration takes place at the loop apex .",
    "this would mean that if the solar flare particle acceleration volume is in the range of @xmath97 mm@xmath98 with the number density of @xmath99 m@xmath30 , to match the observational @xmath96 accelerated electrons per second , full 100% of electrons need to be accelerated .",
    "there is no known particle acceleration mechanism that operates with the 100% efficiency .",
    "thus it would seem attractive to have flare energy release triggering daws which rush down the footpoints and accelerate electrons along the way to chromosphere @xcite .",
    "such scenario is rather attractive in the light of the earlier work ref . which showed that such particle acceleration is indeed possible .",

    "along the magnetic field the ion distribution function remains unchanged ( fig.3(d ) ) .",
    "the evolution of the amplitude of the parallel electric field is studied in fig.3(g ) where we plot @xmath177 . since parallel electric field",
    "is mostly confined to the density gradient regions @xmath177 as function of time essentially tracks the amplitude of the generated parallel electric field in the density gradients .",
    "we see that after initial growth it saturates at about 0.03 .",
    "we quantify the particle acceleration and plasma heating by defining the following indexes : @xmath178 @xmath179        here @xmath180 are electron or ion velocity distribution functions .",
    "they are normalised in such a way that when integrated by all spatial and velocity components they give the total number of real electrons and ions ( not pseudo - particles that usually mimic much larger number of real particles in the particle - in - cell simulation ) .",
    "@xmath181 is the width of each density gradients according to eq.(1 ) , located within @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "@xmath182 is the full width in the @xmath54-direction .",
    "the numerator of eq.(8 ) gives the number of superthermal electrons in the parallel to the magnetic field direction , as a function of time , divided by the area ( @xmath183 ) where the electron acceleration takes place . as we know from fig .",
    "1 parallel electric field is generated only in the two density gradient regions .",
    "the denominator gives total number of real electrons in the whole simulation box , at @xmath184 , divided by the total area ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "thus , the definition used in eq.(8 ) effectively provides the fraction ( the percentage ) of accelerated electrons in the density gradient regions .",
    "the same logic applies to ions as reflected by eq.(9 ) but in the transverse direction .",
    "the choice for such indexes has several reasons : ( i ) @xmath186 and @xmath187 quantify fraction of electrons and ions at time @xmath188 with velocities greater than average thermal velocity in density gradient regions , in the parallel and perpendicular direction respectively ; ( ii ) as can be seen from figs.3 - 9 and 12 - 16 , driving by daws mostly affect electron motion parallel to the magnetic field , while for ions the effect is only in the perpendicular direction ; ( iii ) they way how @xmath186 and @xmath187 are defined alleviates the problem that the distribution function value varies as the total number of particles in the simulation is altered in different runs ( because domain size needs to be adjusted so that daws do not collide producing interference ) . for example comparing fig .",
    "3(a ) and 9(a ) we see that the height of the peak at @xmath189 is different despite the fact that both graphs show the distribution function for the medium with the same temperature distribution and other parameters .",
    "this is due to the fact that distribution function is normalised such that when integrated by all spatial and velocity components , it gives the total number of particles ( not pseudo - particles ) in the simulation .",
    "9 pertains to the run l73 in which number of grids ( @xmath190 ) is more than twice compared to the run l16 in which @xmath191 . since we always load 100 electrons and 100 ions per cell , this results in doubling the peak height in fig.9(a ) compared to fig .",
    "3(a ) , as there are twice as many particles in run l73 than in run l16 .",
    "it is clear from the definition ( eq.(8 ) ) that this difference in heights cancels out , thus providing the true precentage of accelerated electrons in the density gradient regions .",
    "the only drawback our @xmath186 and @xmath187 indexes have is that they can not distinguish between particle acceleration ( in which case bumps on the distribution function appear ) and heating ( in which case distribution function simple broadens , proportionately retaining its shape at @xmath184 ) . despite this @xmath186 and @xmath187 indexes still provide useful information about the fraction of particles at time @xmath188 with velocities greater than average thermal velocity in the density gradient regions . we gather from fig .",
    "3(h ) that @xmath186 and @xmath187 indexes attain values 0.2 and 0.35 , respectively .",
    "this means that in the density gradient regions 20% of electrons are accelerated in the parallel to the magnetic field direction , and 35% of ions gained velocity above thermal ( were heated up ) in the transverse direction .",
    "it should be noted that these conclusions apply for the end simulation time of @xmath192 .",
    "see discussion of run l16long which discusses long term dynamics that corresponds to @xmath193 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in ref.@xcite we used much more computationally demanding definition ( see eq.(5 ) from ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the demanding part is storing large data for the distribution function ( @xmath194 ) in order to perform integration by @xmath195 .",
    "our above definition ( eq.(8 ) ) is much less demanding because it only stores @xmath196 and spatial integration is replaced by the factor @xmath197 . by comparing the rightmost data point for @xmath186 in fig .",
    "3(h ) with middle data point from fig .",
    "2(b ) from ref.@xcite ( because their physical parameters are the same ) , we gather that they both yield value of 0.2 , thus proving that the both definitions are quivalent . another observation we make is that @xmath186 starts from about 0.15 . which is reasonable because it is known that for a maxwellian distribution ( which holds before the particle acceleration takes place ) 16% of particles have velocty above thermal .",
    "this , of course , applies to a maxwellian with a uniform temperature . in our case plasma temperature",
    "varies across @xmath54 coordinate , thus the maxwellian does not appear as a parabola in e.g. fig .",

    "4 , 5 and 6 correspond to the runs r16 , el16 and er16 .",

    "4(f ) , 5(f ) and 6(f ) that transverse beams start to form in the ignorable @xmath134 spatial direction .",
    "as far as the generated parallel electric field , in the density gradient regions , it saturates at about the same level of 0.03 .",
    "@xmath186 and @xmath187 indexes also exhibit similar behaviour .",
    "this is due to the fact that more efficient electron and ion acceleration produces relatively small number of more energetic particles , which do not affect in the indexes greatly .",
    "intermediate conclusions that can be drawn from comparing runs l16 , r16 , el16 and er16 are that in the inertial regime , r - circularly polarised , l - and r - elliptically polarised daw with electric field in the non - ignorable ( @xmath54 ) transverse direction exceeding 6 times that of in the ignorable ( @xmath134 ) direction produce more pronounced parallel electron beams ( in @xmath198 ) and transverse ion beams in the ignorable ( @xmath199 ) direction .",
    "the electron beam speed coincides with the daw seed .",
    "we gather from fig .",

    "we note from table  [ pars ] that phase speed of daws is @xmath202 .",
    "thus electron acceleration seems to be due to the wave - particle interaction effects .",
    "namely , due to the landau damping in which wave gives up energy whilst accelerating particles .",
    "particles which are faster than the wave give up their energy to the wave , while particles which are slower gain energy from the wave . for a given phase speed of the wave , @xmath203 , in the maxwellian distribution",
    "there are always more particles with @xmath204 than particles with @xmath205 .",
    "thus , the net result of having maxwellian distribution is that the wave gives up its momentum to the particles with @xmath206 and accelerates them . as a result",
    "the accelerated particle number increases around @xmath207 , i.e. a beam forms with @xmath207 .",
    "it is interesting to note that similar conclusion has been drawn from theoretical calculations .",
    "it should be stressed that their calculations were performed in the _ kinetic _ regime . whereas the above conclusions are in the _ inertial _ regime ( because of the artificially lowered mass ratio ) .",
    "we also note that similar conclusions still hold in the kinetic regime in our simulations ( see below ) .",
    "thus electron acceleration can be understood by simple landau damping of daws despite of the regime ( inertial or kinetic ) .",

    "9 shows the results for the run l73 which brings us into the kinetic regime . by comparing this run to l16 which is in the inertial regime we note following differences : ( i ) bumps in the parallel electron velocity distribution function , which represent the electron beam created by the parallel electric field ,",

    "( ii ) @xmath186 index now attains 29% which is about 50% larger than that of the run l16 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that at lower velocities there more particles with lower velocity . at present",
    "@xmath9 is not accessible due to high computational costs . but",
    "from run l73 it is clear that more massive ions would yield even higher fraction of accelerated electrons with speeds comparable to the daw speed .",

    "note that as we have increased ion mass from 16 to 73.44 we had to about double the domain length in order to prevent the two daws from colliding with each other , so the results are not affected by the wave interference . as can be seen from fig .",

    "remeber that in case of l16 @xmath186 attained only 20% by the time @xmath192 .",
    "thus we conclude that in run l16 the physical quantities have nearly reached their asymptotic values .",
    "x - ray observations of solar flares indicate that @xmath96 per second accelerated electrons are required to produce the observed hard x - ray emission .",
    "if the particle acceleration takes place at the loop apex , this implies that for the acceleration volume of @xmath97 mm@xmath98 with the number density of @xmath99 m@xmath30 all 100% of electrons need to be accelerated .",
    "given the implausibility of the latter acceleration efficiency , if the flare energy release triggers daws , these can rush down the solar coronal loop towards the footpoints and accelerate electrons along the way to chromosphere @xcite . in this context and in the light of our initial study ref .",

    "the daws propagate in the transversely inhomogeneous plasma . in which density",
    "is increased in the middle , across the magnetic field , by factor of four and temperature is lowered accordingly to keep the structure in pressure balance .",
    "such system mimics a solar coronal loop .",
    "daws generate parallel electric field only in the density inhomogeneity regions ( loop edges ) .",
    "this parallel electric field behaviour coincides with the parallel current @xmath217 .",
    "the latter indicates that charge separation ( due to different electron and ion inertia ) is the cause of the parallel electric field generation .",
    "@xmath37 then accelerates electrons ( creates electron beams ) along the magnetic field , while @xmath132 mostly heats ions in the transverse direction . in this study",
    "we focus on the effect of the wave polarisation , l- and r- circular and elliptical , in the different regimes inertial ( @xmath52 ) and kinetic ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "plasma beta is fixed at 0.02 .",
    "hence we vary the regimes by setting either @xmath218 ( inertial regime ) and @xmath219 ( kinetic regime ) .",
    "the mass ratio of @xmath220 is not ideal ( it corresponds to @xmath221th or the real mass ratio of @xmath222 ) but it is on the limit of available computational resources as a typical with @xmath72 run takes 48 hours on 256 processors ( here we present the results from total of 13 runs ) .",
    "our main goal was to study the latter effects on the efficiency of particle acceleration and the parallel electric field generation .",
    "as a result we have established : ( i ) in the inertial regime , fraction of accelerated electrons ( along the magnetic field ) , in the density gradient regions is @xmath0 by the time of ic driving of @xmath192 which allows for the @xmath223 full wavelength to develop and is increasing to @xmath1 by the time of @xmath193 that allows for the @xmath224 wavelength to develop . in all considered cases ( see table  [ runs ] ) ions are heated in the transverse to the magnetic field direction and fraction of heated ions ( with velocities above initial average thermal speed ) is @xmath2 .",
    "( ii ) while keeping the power of injected daws the same in all considered numerical simulation runs , in the case of right circular , left and right elliptical polarisation daws with the electric field in the non - ignorable ( @xmath54 ) transverse direction exceeding several times that of in the ignorable ( @xmath134 ) direction produce more pronounced parallel electron beams ( with larger maximal electron velocities ) and transverse ion beams in the ignorable ( @xmath199 ) direction . in the inertial regime",

    "this increases to @xmath225 .",
    "( iv ) the parallel electric field that is generated in the density inhomogeneity regions is independent of the regime ( whether kinetic or inertial ) , i.e. independent of electron - ion mass ratio and stays of the order @xmath5 which for considered solar flaring plasma parameters ( @xmath99 m@xmath30 and @xmath226k at the domain edges ) exceeds dreicer electric field @xmath19 ( with coulomb logarithm @xmath227 ) by a factor of @xmath228 .",
    "although our pic simulations do not include particle collisions , and thus dreicer electric field is not directly relevant because this concept is essentially collisional , the fact that the generated parallel electric field exceeds dreicer value by eight orders of magnitude indicates that the accelerated electrons would be in the run - away regime . the fact that in the present simulations @xmath37 amplitude is independent of @xmath73 contradicts with the scaling law ( @xmath229 ) found by ref.@xcite .",
    "the difference can possibly explained by the fact that ref.@xcite considered cold plasma approximation i.e. all particles had the same velocity ( with the distribution function being a delta - function rather than a maxwellian ) .",

    "( v ) electron beam velocity has the phase velocity of the daw .",
    "this can be understood by landau damping of daws .",
    "daws give up their energy to electrons via collisionless landau damping . because for the daws with @xmath230 their phase seed is approximately the alfven speed , this , combined with the suggestion by ref.@xcite that alfven speed can be as high as few @xmath231 , for the realistic mass ratio of @xmath9 , would readily provide electrons with few tens of kev .",
    "e.g. for @xmath6 the electron energy would be 23 kev .",
    "( vi ) as we increased the mass ratio from @xmath7 to 73.44 the fraction of accelerated electrons has increased from @xmath3 to @xmath8 ( depending on daw polarisation ) .",
    "this is because the velocity of the beam has shifted to lower velocity ( compare e.g. fig.3(a ) to 9(a ) ) . since there are _ always more electrons with a smaller velocity than higher velocity _ in the maxwellian distribution , for the mass ratio @xmath9 the fraction of accelerated electrons would be even higher than @xmath4 .",

    "these perturbations of density and temperature should in principle be detectable in _ future _ observations because current time cadence of space instruments is well above @xmath232 .",
    "the overall conclusion is that daws , propagating in the transversely inhomogeneous plasma , in the alfvenic ( @xmath31 ) range of the plasma dispersion can effectively accelerate electrons along the magnetic field and heat the ions in the transverse direction .",
