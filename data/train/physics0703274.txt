    "in quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) plasma and fluid flows the energy flux from small scale turbulent modes toward lower wavenumber modes can dominate the classical kolmogorov cascade to dissipative scales , with the result that energy can accumulate in large scale coherent structures .",
    "zonal flows in planetary atmospheres and in magnetically confined fusion plasmas are well - known examples of such coherent structures .",
    "quasi two - dimensional fluid systems in which turbulent activities and coherent structures interact can undergo a spontaneous transition to a turbulence - suppressed regime . in plasmas such transitions dramatically enhance the confinement and",
    "are known as l  h or confinement transitions . from theoretical and experimental works",
    "the importance of shear or zonal flows for suppression of cross - field transport and confinement improvement is now widely appreciated .    several low - dimensional dynamical models , comprised of a small number of coupled ordinary differential equations , have been proposed to describe and predict the l  h transition@xcite .",

    "the model is based on the reduced resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations with the electrostatic approximation , and describes the pressure - gradient - driven turbulence ",
    "shear flow energetics .",
    "this approach using low - dimensional modeling greatly simplifies the problem , and when validated against simulated or real experimental data , will provide an economical tool to predict transitions over the parameter space .",
    "in this work we report the results of numerical simulations that both complement the low - dimensional modeling results and raise some interesting issues in their own right .",
    "we focus on a model for electrostatic resistive drift wave turbulence , the hasegawa - wakatani ( hw ) model@xcite , and solve the equations by direct numerical simulation in 2d slab geometry .",
    "the hw model has been widely used to investigate anomalous edge transport due to collisional drift waves@xcite .",
    "moreover , self - organization of a shear flow has been shown by numerical simulation of the hw model in cylindrical geometry@xcite .",
    "thus we consider the hw model is a good starting point for studying self - consistent turbulence ",
    "shear flow interactions , even though it does not describe physics that can be important in specific situations , such as magnetic curvature , magnetic shear , and electromagnetic effect .",
    "the physical setting of the hw model may be considered as the edge region of a tokamak plasma of nonuniform density @xmath1 and in a constant equilibrium magnetic field @xmath2 . following the drift wave ordering@xcite ,",
    "the density @xmath3 and the electrostatic potential @xmath4 perpendicular to the magnetic field are governed by the continuity equation for ions or electrons and the ion vorticity equation , @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the @xmath8 convective derivative ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 is the ion mass , @xmath12 is the current density in the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the continuity equation ( [ eq : drifteq_n ] ) can refer to ions and electrons because @xmath13 under the quasineutral condition , and ( [ eq : drifteq_v ] ) holds because the current density is divergence - free .",
    "since the ion inertia is negligible in the parallel direction ( @xmath14 ) , the parallel current is determined by the ohm s law , @xmath15 if the parallel heat conductivity is sufficiently large , the electrons may be treated as isothermal : @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the pressure , @xmath18 is the temperature , and subscript @xmath19 refers to electrons . )",
    "this gives the parallel current as @xmath20 if we eliminate @xmath12 from ( @xmath21 ) , ( @xmath22 ) and normalize variables as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the ion cyclotron frequency , and @xmath25 is the ion sound larmor radius , we finally obtain the resistive drift wave equations known as the hasegawa - wakatani ( hw ) model@xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the poisson bracket , @xmath28 is the 2d laplacian , @xmath29 is the vorticity .",

    "@xmath36 becomes a constant coefficient , or parameter , by the replacement @xmath37 .",
    "this resistive coupling term must be treated carefully in a 2d model because zonal components of fluctuations ( the @xmath38 modes ) do not contribute to the parallel current@xcite .",
    "recalling that the tokamak edge turbulence is considered here , @xmath0 should always coincide with @xmath39 because any potential fluctuation on the flux surface is neutralized by parallel electron motion .",
    "let us define zonal and non - zonal components of a variable @xmath40 as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the periodic length in @xmath43 , and remove the contribution by the zonal components in the resistive coupling term in ( [ eq : hwv ] ) and ( [ eq : hwn ] ) .",
    "by subtracting the zonal components from the resistive coupling term @xmath44 , we end up with the modified hw ( mhw ) equations , @xmath45 the evolution of the zonal components can be extracted from ( [ eq : mhwv ] ) and ( [ eq : mhwn ] ) by averaging in the @xmath43 direction : @xmath46 where @xmath40 stands for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and @xmath49 stands for the corresponding dissipation coefficients .",

    "the system is unstable for most wavenumbers . during a typical evolution ,",
    "initial small amplitude perturbations grow linearly until the nonlinear terms begin to dominate .",

    ", the zonal flow grows in the linear phase , as well as the other modes , up to a few percent of the kinetic energy , and saturates . on the other hand , in the mhw model the zonal kinetic energy continues to grow after the linear phase , and dominates the kinetic energy .",
    "the kinetic energy contained in other modes decreases to a few percent of the total kinetic energy .",
    "in the original 2d hw model , the resistive coupling term is retained for the zonal modes , the effect of which is to prevent development of zonal flows .",
    "but since the zonal modes do not carry parallel currents it is clearly unphysical to retain resistive action on them .",
    "subtraction of the zonal components from the resistive coupling term is necessary to permit the generation of zonal flows .            the density flux in @xmath93 direction @xmath63 ( transport across the magnetic field ) , together with the energy partition to the kinetic energy @xmath94 and the potential energy @xmath95 , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : transport ] .",
