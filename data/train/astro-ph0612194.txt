    "multiwavelenght follow - up studies of grbs in the last decade have established that a significant fraction of long grbs arise from the simultaneous collapse of a massive star ( e.g. woosley & bloom 2006 , della valle 2006 ) .",
    "best examples of this are the sn / grb associations so far discovered in the local universe , 2006aj with grb 060218 ( pian  2006 , campana  2006 , modiaz et al .",
    "2006 ) and sn 1998bw with 980425 ( galama  1998 ) .",
    "further evidence ( @xmath12 ) comes from sn 2003dh with grb 030329 ( stanek  2003 ; hjorth  2003 ) and grb 031203 , which have been found to be associated with bright broad - lined type ic sne ( malesani  2004 ) .",
    "this type of grb / sn association applies to a significant fraction of long grbs , but not all of them ( della valle et al .",
    "2006a , fynbo et al .",
    "2006 , gal - yam et al .",
    "2006 , gehrels et al .",
    "2006 ) . at larger redshifts",
    "the association grb - sne relies on about a dozen of rebrightenings ( `` bumps '' ) observed during the late decay stages of the grb afterglow light curve ( see zeh  2004 and references therein ) .",
    "they have been interpreted as due to the emergence of the optical contribution of an underlying sn ( bloom  1999 ) . in two cases , grb 021211/sn 2002lt ( della valle  2003 ) and grb 050525a / sn 2005nc ( della valle  2006b ) , spectroscopic observations obtained during these `` bumps '' are suggestive of the presence of sn components . in spite of these remarkable achievements ,",
    "there are still many uncertainties hampering our knowledge the rate of these events .",
    "particularly , the recent discovery of grb 060218 at z=0.03 has raised the question whether or not a population of `` local '' and `` low - luminosity '' grbs ( ll - grbs , i.e. @xmath0 erg / sec ) with different properties from the energetically `` high - luminosity '' grbs ( hl - grbs ) does exist ( e.g. cobb  2006 , soderberg et al . 2006a , amati et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the aim of this letter is twofold : first we derive the rate for the local ( @xmath13 ) and ll - grbs , with two independent approaches . then , we investigate the existence of two classes of grbs by measuring the ratios of the rates of ll - grbs and hl - grbs to sne - ibc progenitors .",
    "we consider three ll - grbs , grb 980425 ( z=0.008 ) , grb 060218 ( z=0.03 ) and grb 031203 ( z=0.105 ) detected by _ bepposax",
    "_ wide field camera ( wfc ) , _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) and integral respectively and infer from them an empirical rate for subluminous grbs . following soderberg et al .",
    "2006a we estimate the peak flux in the range 1 - 1000 kev and compare it with the threshold peak flux calculated by band ( 2003 , 2006 ) . in this way",
    "we derive the maximum distance ( @xmath14 ) the event could be detected and therefore the maximum volume ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "considering the sky coverage ( @xmath16 ) and the number of years of operation ( @xmath17 ) of each individual the detector the rate of ll - grbs similar to the grbs given above is : @xmath18    * grb 980425 * this burst was detected by _ bepposax _",
    "wfc ( pian  1999 ) and by batse ( kippen 1998 ) . the peak flux in the 50 - 300 kev band was @xmath19 ph @xmath20 s@xmath3 .",
    "the redshift of this burst is z=0.0085 , implying an isotropic peak luminosity @xmath21 erg s@xmath3 several orders of magnitude smaller than typical long hl - grbs that have @xmath22 erg@xmath23 on average . by using the spectrum given by jimenez , band & piran ( 2001 )",
    "we extrapolate the peak flux @xmath24 ph @xmath20 s@xmath3 . given the threshold @xmath25 ph @xmath20 s@xmath3 we find @xmath26 mpc .",
    "the bepposax sky coverage was about 0.08 and the operation time @xmath27 4 yrs .",
    "therefore the rate of grb 980425-like events is @xmath28 gpc@xmath2 yr@xmath3 .",
    "* grb 060218*. this burst was detected by _",
    "the peak flux was @xmath29 erg @xmath20 s@xmath3 and the spectral index 1.5 ( campana  2006 ) .",
    "the redshift is , z=0.03 , implying an isotropic peak luminosity of the order of @xmath30 .",
    "the extrapolated peak flux is @xmath31 ph @xmath20 s@xmath3 .",
    "given the threshold @xmath32 ph @xmath20 s@xmath3 we find @xmath33 mpc .",
    "the _ swift _ sky coverage was 0.17 and the operation time is one year",
    ". therefore we estimate that the rate of grb 060218-like events is @xmath34 gpc@xmath2 yr@xmath3 .",
    "* grb 031203 * this burst was detected by integral ( malesani  2004 ) .",
    "the peak flux in the 20 - 200 kev band was @xmath35 ph @xmath20 s@xmath3 and the spectral index is 0.8 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the redshift of this burst is , z=0.105 , implying an isotropic peak luminosity @xmath37 erg s@xmath3 that is three order of magnitude smaller than canonical long bursts but two order higher than the previous ones .",
    "the extrapolated flux is @xmath38 ph @xmath20 s@xmath3 .",
    "given the threshold @xmath39 ph @xmath20 s@xmath3 ( mereghetti & gtz 2005 ) we find @xmath40 mpc .",
    "the integral sky coverage is 0.5% and the operation time was 3 yrs",
    ". therefore the rate of grb 031203-like events is @xmath41 gpc@xmath2 yr@xmath3 .",
    "the redshift and the luminosity of this burst are intermediate between ll - grbs and hl - grbs and this suggest a continuity between the two classes .    the occurrence of two events such as grb 980425 and grb 060218 , within @xmath42 mpc distance implies a rate of @xmath43 ll - grb gpc@xmath2 yr@xmath3 in agreement with soderberg et al .",
    "2006a result .",
    "the attached errors represent @xmath44 poissonian standard deviation ( gherels 1986 ) .",
    "another potential source of uncertainty ( which is not included ) is the correction for beaming .",
    "however , we point out that ll - grbs may be much less collimated than typical hl - grbs ( see next section ) . one way to estimate the jet opening angle , @xmath45 , is to look for `` achromatic - breaks '' in the afterglow light curve .",
    "the steepening of the afterglow light curve , break , occurs when the bulk lorentz factor of the relativistic outflow becomes lower than @xmath46 . from the data on the afterglow of grb 980425 and grb 060218 it seems that the presence of breaks in the light curves is very late , if existent at all , implying very large @xmath45 .",
    "for example radio observations of grb 060218 ( soderberg  2006a ) have set @xmath47 which corresponds to a beaming factor ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 . by interpreting the break in the x - ray light curve of grb 031203 as due to a jet",
    ", we obtain @xmath50 , which corresponds to @xmath51 .",
    "the beaming corrected rate would thus be @xmath52 event gpc@xmath2 yr@xmath3 , consistent with the value reported above .",
    "the above estimate of the ll - grbs rate may be affected by the small number of available events , therefore an independent check is in order . to do this we compare the empirical rate with the rate inferred from the large grb samples obtained by both batse and swift .",
    "as suggested by schmidt ( 2001 ) , the grb local rate can be estimated by using the batse peak flux distribution .",
    "this is given by the convolution of two unknown quantities , the luminosity function ( lf ) and the grb formation rate . following guetta , piran & waxman ( 2005 ) and guetta et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we assume that grbs trace the star formation history and adopt the rowan - robinson star formation rate ( sfr ) , @xmath53 , ( rowan - robinson 1999 ) .",
    "other rate evolutions have been analized in detail in firmiani et al .",
    "then we find the best fit to the lf by comparing the batse observed peak flux distribution with the predicted one , assuming a form for the lf ( i.e. a power law with a minimum and maximum luminosities ) .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 that a single power - law lf , @xmath54 , with a minimum ( @xmath55 erg s@xmath3 ) and maximum luminosity ( l@xmath56 erg s@xmath3 ) fits the batse peak flux distribution very well . to obtain the observed local rate of grbs per unit volume , @xmath57 , we need to estimate the effective full - sky coverage of our grb sample .",
    "the batse catalog represents 3.185 years of batse full sky coverage implying a rate of 692 grb per year . using our lf we find @xmath58gpc@xmath2yr@xmath3 , that is much smaller than what would be required in order to explain the local rate of ll - grbs . ] .",
    "however the local rate discussed in the previous paragraph was derived under the hypothesis that classical bursts exceed by far the luminosity of grb 980425 , of grb 060218 and of grb 031203 ( i.e. in the estimate of the rate guetta , piran & waxman ( 2005 ) considered a minimum luminosity for the luminosity function ( lf ) @xmath59 erg / sec ) : as such , this rate can not be compared with the empirical one derived for ll - grbs .",
    "a self consistent estimate can only be obtained with a lf that extends down to luminosities as low as that of grb 980425 and grb 060218 .",
    "it is important to realize that most of the bursts below @xmath60 erg s@xmath3 ( ll - grbs ) are undetectable by current detectors , unless they are extremely close ( z@xmath61 ) .",
    "on the basis of the observables that we have ( i.e. the peak flux distribution ) we can not constrain the minimum value of the lf , therefore we find reasonable to take the minimum luminosity observed in grbs ( @xmath30 ) as our minimum value for the lf .",
    "if we repeat the same procedure given above using the same lf and l@xmath62 but a different @xmath63 , we find that the batse peak flux distribution is fitted very well and the rate increases as @xmath64gpc@xmath2yr@xmath3 .",
    "the increase in the rate of ll - grb is due to the fact that the luminosity function increases rapidly with decreasing luminosity from @xmath65 ergs / sec down to @xmath63 ( guetta & piran 2006 ) . if we further extend the lf considering @xmath66 in the range between @xmath67 we obtain @xmath68 gpc@xmath2 yr@xmath3 consistent with the empirical rate determined in section 2 .",
    "this luminosity function fits well also the swift peak flux distribution . taking into account that swift has detected 122 long grbs in 1.6 yr and covers 1/6 of the sky ,",
    "applying the same method described above , we find a rate of @xmath69 for @xmath66 in the range between @xmath67 consistent with the rate derived from the batse data and with the empirical rate .",
    "the fraction of sne - ibc that produces grbs can be measured as follows .",
    "a rate of @xmath70 sne - ibc gpc@xmath2 yr@xmath3 is derived by combining the local density of b luminosity of @xmath71 mpc@xmath2 ( e.g. madau , della valle & panagia 1998 ) with the rate of sne - ibc observed in sbc ",
    "irr hubble types ( these morphological types are appropriate to represent the grb hosts ) of 0.16 sne per century and per 10@xmath72 @xmath73 ( snu units , cappellaro , evans & turatto 1999 ) .",
    "this sn rate has to be compared with the rate of hl - grbs of @xmath74 grb gpc@xmath2 yr@xmath3 ( guetta , piran & waxman 2005 ) after rescaling for the jet beaming factor , @xmath75 .",
    "there exist different estimates for this parameter : from @xmath76 ( guetta , piran & waxman 2005 ) to @xmath77 ( frail  2001 ) corresponding to beaming angles @xmath78@xmath79 , respectively . taking these figures at their face value",
    ", we find the ratio hl - grb / sne - ibc to be in the range : @xmath80 and the ratio ll - grbs / sne - ibc : @xmath5 ( for @xmath81 ) .",
    "radio surveys give independent and consistent constraints : berger  ( 2003 ) find that the incidence of sn 1998bw - like events , in the nearby universe , is @xmath82 , soderberg et al .",
    "( 2006c ) find hl - grb / sne - ibc @xmath83 .",
    "the computation of the grb / hne ratio requires a further step .",
    "the measurement of the sn rate is based on the control - time methodology ( zwicky 1938 ) that implies the systematic monitoring of galaxies of known distances and the use of appropriate templates for the light curves of each sn type ( see cappellaro  1993 for bias and uncertainties connected with this procedure ) .",
    "unfortunately all hypernovae reported in tab .",
    "i have not been discovered during time ` controlled ' surveys , and therefore any attempt to derive an absolute value of the rate of hypernovae should be taken with caution .",
    "one possibility is to compute the frequency of occurrence of all sne - ib / c and hypernovae in a limited distance sample of objects .",
    "we extracted 193 sne - ib / c from an upgraded version of the asiago catalog ( ` http://web.pd.astro.it/supern ` ) , 19 of these have been spectroscopically classified as hypernovae .    in fig .",
    "2 we show that the cumulative distributions of the recession velocities of the hosts of hne ( i.e. broad - lined sne - ib / c ) and `` standard '' sne - ibc ( dotted line ) are statistically indistinguishable ( ks probability=0.73 ) for @xmath84 km / s . within this volume",
    "we find 158 objects , 12 of which are hne . after excluding sn 1998bw and 2006aj , because they were not serendipitously discovered and assuming that the host galaxies of both ` normal ' sne ib / c and hypernovae were monitored with a comparable level of efficiency , we infer that the fraction of hypernovae is about @xmath85 of the total number of sne ib / c .",
    "therefore the hn rate turns out to be @xmath27 0.015 sne per century and per 10@xmath72 @xmath73 .",
    "note that this value is about an order of magnitude larger than reported by podsiadlowski et al .",
    "these authors find a similar ratio hne / sne - ibc ( about 5% ) , however they assume that hne are on average 4 times brighter than `` standard '' sne - ibc , and therefore they can be detected in a volume about 10 times larger , therefore they adopt an `` actual '' ratio hne / sne - ibc @xmath86 .",
    "however their assumption on the luminosity at maximum of hne does not seem supported by either our fig . 2 and the results of soderberg et al .",
    "( 2006b ) who find the magnitude distribution of grb / xrf - sne and local sne - ib / c ( see richardson et al .",
    "2006 ) to be statistically indistinguishable .",
    "finally we check whether our result is consistent with the lack of a single hn detection in the cappellaro s  ( 1999 ) sample . in particular , from poisson statistics we find that the probabilities of obtaining a null result are @xmath2750% and @xmath275% when the expected hn numbers are 0.7 and 3.0 . after",
    "using the control time of cappellaro  ( 1999 ) we derive @xmath87 and @xmath88 hne per century per 10@xmath72 @xmath73 .",
    "then , one should expect that the hn rate is likely similar to the 50% probability value ( 0.012 snu ) and hardly higher than the 5% probability value ( 0.05 snu ) .",
    "the rate of 0.015 snu derived in this paper is fully consistent with the limits set by the poissonian statistics .",
    "together these data imply a ratio ll - grbs / hne in the range @xmath89 and beaming factors @xmath90 ( or @xmath91 ) . in view of these findings , we shall assume , in the following , that ll - grbs emit ( almost ) isotropically .",
    "it is interesting to compare the beaming corrected rate of hl - grbs with the rate of ll - grbs . for every observed hl - grb",
    "there are @xmath92 bursts that are not observed , thus the true rate is @xmath93 gpc@xmath2 yr@xmath3 . for isotropic ll - grbs",
    "our analysis yields comparable rates : @xmath94 gpc@xmath2 yr@xmath3 ( see section 2 ) , @xmath95 gpc@xmath2 yr@xmath3 ( from swift data , section 3 ) and @xmath96 gpc@xmath2 yr@xmath3 ( from batse data , section 3 ) .",
    "these results indicate that if there are two populations of grbs ( hl - grbs and ll - grbs ) the respective frequency of occurrence are comparable within a factor of @xmath97 .",
    "however the data do not exclude the case that only one population of grbs is responsible for giving rise to both the highly collimated component ( preferentially observable at high z ) and to the almost isotropic components ( detectable only in nearby grbs ) ( e.g. woosley & heger 2006 ) .    .hypernovae",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > \" , ]",
    "from the available information on grbs and sne - ibc rates a number of interesting results emerge :    \\i ) we have computed the hn rate , on robust empirical grounds , and found that this sub - class of sne - ibc , characterized by broad - lined spectra , includes about 7% of sne - ibc .",
    "an analysis of the cumulative distribution of the recession velocities of the respective hosts , does not suggest that hne are intrinsically more luminous ( on average ) than standard sne - ibc .",
    "all together these facts imply a hn rate of @xmath7 hne @xmath98 .",
    "\\ii ) the ratio hl - grbs / hne is smaller than 1 , possibly in the range 0.040.3 .",
    "the ratio ll - grb / hne is in the range 0.11 .",
    "\\iii ) if we assume that all hne are able to produce ll - grbs , then the ll - grb / hne ratio allows us to constrain the beaming factor to be smaller than @xmath90 .",
    "\\iv ) from the analysis of two nearest grbs we have derived a ll - grb rate of @xmath43 grbs gpc@xmath2 yr@xmath3 .",
    "the attached errors represent @xmath44 poissonian standard deviation .",
    "this result is consistent with the rates of 2001800 and 1001200 ll - grb gpc@xmath2 yr@xmath3 , derived from the batse and swift grbs .",
    "\\v ) the frequencies of occurrence of hl - grbs ( hl - grb / sne - ibc @xmath82 ) and ll - grbs ( ll - grb / sne - ibc @xmath99 ) may suggest the existence of two physically distinct classes of grbs ( e.g. cobb et al .",

    "2006a , pian et al .",
    "2006 , amati et al .",
    "2006 ) in which ll - grbs are ( intrinsically ) more frequent events than hl - grbs .",
    "however , due to the uncertainties , we can not exclude that a single population of grbs originates both the isotropic and sub - energetic component , detectable only in nearby grbs , and the highly collimated component , observable by sampling huge volumes of space , and thus mainly detectable in high - z grbs .",

    "<S> we measure the local rates of `` low - luminosity '' ( ll - grbs , i.e. @xmath0erg / sec ) and `` high - luminosity '' gamma - ray bursts ( hl - grbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the values are in the range @xmath1 gpc@xmath2 yr@xmath3 and @xmath4 gpc@xmath2 yr@xmath3 , respectively , and the ratios to sne - ibc @xmath5 and @xmath6 . these data may suggest the existence of two physically distinct classes of grbs in which ll - grbs are ( intrinsically ) more frequent events than hl - grbs . however , with the present data we can not exclude the possibility of a single population of grbs which give rise to both an isotropic low - luminous emission ( ll - grbs : detectable only in nearby grbs ) and to a highly collimated high - luminous emission ( hl - grbs : detectable preferentially at high - z ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compute also the rate of sne - ibc characterized by broad - lined spectra ( hypernovae ) and found it to be about @xmath7hne yr@xmath3 @xmath8 l@xmath9 ( i.e less than @xmath10 of sne - ibc occurring in spirals ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result implies that the ratio hl - grbs / hne is smaller than 1 , possibly in the range 0.040.3 . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the ratio between hypernovae and ll - grbs to constrain their beaming factor to @xmath11 or less .    0 _ 5_,0.5 </S>"
