    "in the last decade , quantile regression has attracted considerable attention .",
    "there are two major reasons for such popularity .",
    "the first is that quantile regression estimation @xcite can be robust to non - gaussian or heavy - tailed data .",
    "in addition , it includes the commonly used least absolute deviation ( lad ) method as a special case .",
    "the second is that the quantile regression model allows practitioners to provide more easily interpretable regression estimates obtained via various quantiles @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "more references about quantile regression estimations and interpretations can be found in the seminal book of @xcite .",
    "further extension of quantile regression to various model and data structures have been found in the literature , e.g. , @xcite for count data , @xcite for power transformed data , @xcite and @xcite for survival analysis , @xcite and @xcite for regression with measurement errors , @xcite for regression with augmented factors , and @xcite for semiparametric varying - coefficient partially linear models , among others .",
    "in addition to the regression context , the quantile technique has been employed to the field of time series ; see , for example , @xcite and @xcite for autoregressive ( ar ) models , @xcite for unstable ar models , and @xcite for generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic ( garch ) models .",
    "it is noteworthy that @xcite established important statistical properties for quantile autoregressive ( qar ) models , and suggested a modified bayesian information criterion ( bic ) to select the order of qar models .",
    "their findings have expanded the classical ar model into a new era , which motivates us to extend the classical box - jenkins approach ( i.e. , model identification , model parameter estimation , and model diagnostics ) from ar to qar models . in the classical ar model",
    ", it is known that model identification usually relies on the partial autocorrelation function ( pacf ) of the observed time series , while model diagnosis commonly depends on the autocorrelation function ( acf ) of model residuals .",
    "detailed illustrations of model identification and diagnosis can be found in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to introduce two novel measures to examine the linear and partial linear relationships between any two random variables for the given quantile @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "we name them quantile correlation ( qcor ) and quantile partial correlation ( qpcor ) . based on these two measures ,",
    "we propose the quantile partial autocorrelation function ( qpacf ) and the quantile autocorrelation function ( qacf ) to identify the order of the qar model and to assess model adequacy , respectively .",
    "it is noteworthy that the application of qcor and qpcor is not limited to qar models .",
    "they can be used broadly as the classical correlation and partial correlation measures in various contexts .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces qcor and qpcor .",
    "furthermore , the asymptotic properties of their sample estimators are established .",
    "section 3 obtains qpacf and its large sample property for identifying the order of qar model .",
    "in addition , the autoregressive parameter estimator and its asymptotic distribution are demonstrated .",
    "moreover , qacf and its resulting test statistics , together with their asymptotic results , are provided to examine the model adequacy .",
    "section 4 conducts simulation experiments to study the finite sample performance of the proposed methods , and also presents an empirical example to demonstrate usefulness .",
    "finally , we conclude the article with a brief discussion in section 5 .",
    "all technical proofs of lemmas and theorems are relegated to the appendix .",
    "for random variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 , let @xmath3 be the @xmath4th unconditional quantile of @xmath2 and @xmath5 be the @xmath4th quantile of @xmath2 conditional on @xmath1 .",
    "one can show that @xmath5 is independent of @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath6 with probability one , if and only if the random variables @xmath7 and @xmath1 are independent , where @xmath8 is the indicated function .",
    "this fact has been used by @xcite and @xcite , and it also motivates us to define the quantile covariance given below . for @xmath9 , define @xmath10 where the function @xmath11 .",
    "subsequently , the quantile correlation can be defined as follows , @xmath12 where @xmath13 .    in the simple linear regression with the quadratic loss function",
    ", there is a nice relationship between the slope and correlation .",
    "hence , it is of interest to find a connection between the quantile slope and @xmath14 .",

    "it is noteworthy that the proposed quantile covariance here does not enjoy the symmetry property of the classical covariance , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "this is because the first argument of the quantile covariance or the quantile correlation is related to the @xmath4th quantile , while the second argument is the same as that of the classical covariance .",

    "however , @xcite found that the stock markets under - react to good news in bad times and over - react to bad news in good times .",
    "hence , @xcite proposed aligning a good ( bad ) state with upper ( lower ) quantiles by fitting their stock returns data with the qar(1 ) type models .",
    "this motivates us to employ the general qar model with our proposed methods to explore the dependence pattern of stock returns at a lower quantile ( @xmath215 ) , the median ( @xmath301 ) , and an upper quantile ( @xmath302 ) .",
    "we first fit the returns at the lower quantile ( @xmath215 ) , and then present its sample qpacf in panel a of figure [ nasdaq_fit ] .",
    "it shows that lags 1 , 2 , and 13 are significant , which suggests qar(13 ) could be considered for model fitting .",
    "we then refine the model via the backward variable selection procedure at the @xmath303 significance level .",
    "the resulting model is @xmath304 where the subscripts of parameter estimates are their associated standard errors .",
    "accordingly , the above coefficients are all significant at the 5% significance level . in addition , the second graph in panel a presents the sample qpacf of residuals , and no lags stand out .",
    "this , together with the @xmath216-value of @xmath305 being 0.742 , implies that this model is adequate .",
    "we next consider the scenario with @xmath301 .",
    "the sample qpacf in panel b indicates that all lags are insignificant .",
    "hence , we fit the following model , @xmath306 the above coefficient is not only small , but also not significant . in addition , none of the lags in the sample qacf of residuals in panel b show significance . moreover , the @xmath216-value of @xmath305 is 0.566 .",
    "consequently , the above model is appropriate .",
    "finally , we study the upper quantile scenario with @xmath302 .",
    "the sample qpacf in panel c exhibits that lags 1 , 2 , 7 , 10 and 15 are significant , and suggests qar(15 ) could be considered for model fitting .",
    "after refining the model via the backward variable selection procedure , we obtain @xmath307 where all coefficients are significant at the @xmath303 significance level .",
    "in addition , the sample qacf of residuals in panel c displays that all lags are insignificant .",
    "this , in conjunction with the @xmath216-value of @xmath305 being 0.215 , indicates that the above model fits the data reasonably well .",
    "based on the three fitted qar models , ( [ naslow ] ) , ( [ nasmid ] ) , and ( [ nashigh ] ) , we obtain the following conclusions .",
    "( i. ) the lag coefficients at the lower quantile ( @xmath215 ) are all positive .",
    "this indicates that if the returns in past days have been positive ( negative ) , then today s negative return is alleviated ( even lower ) .",
    "it also implies that stock markets under - react to good news in bad times .",
    "the lag coefficients at the upper quantile ( @xmath302 ) are all negative .",
    "this shows that if the returns in past days have been negative ( positive ) , then today s positive return ( @xmath302 ) is even higher ( dampened ) . as a result ,",
    "stock markets over - react to bad news in good times .",
    "the intercept at ( @xmath301 ) has a small value and is insignificant at the 5% significance level .",
    "thus , the conditional median of returns is almost zero as we expected .",
    "in addition , equation ( [ nasmid ] ) indicates that today s return is not affected by the returns of recent past days .",
    "although we only report the results of the lower and higher quantiles at @xmath215 and @xmath302 , our studies yield the same conclusions across various lower and upper quantiles . in sum",
    ", our proposed methods support veronesi s ( @xcite ) equilibrium explanation for stock market reactions .",
    "in quantile regression models , we propose the quantile correlation and quantile partial correlation .",
    "then , we apply them to quantile autoregressive models , which yields the quantile autocorrelation and quantile partial autocorrelation . in practice ,",
    "the response time series may depend on exogenous variables .",
    "hence , it is of interest to extend those correlation measures to the quantile autoregressive model with the exogenous variables given below .",

    "clearly , the contribution of the proposed measures is not limited to those two models .",
