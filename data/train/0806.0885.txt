    "the discovery of iron - based superconductors has stimulated many interests in searching higher - t@xmath5 superconductors without copper - oxide planes .",
    "soon after the first lao@xmath0f@xmath1feas was reported with t@xmath5=26 k@xcite , rare - earth substitution compounds smo@xmath0f@xmath1feas and ceo@xmath0f@xmath1feas were synthesized and their t@xmath5 s can go up to above 40 k @xcite . for lao@xmath0f@xmath1feas , t@xmath5 can be raised to above 40 k under high pressure@xcite .",
    "a higher t@xmath5 of 52 k in fe - based series superconductors was reported in pro@xmath0f@xmath1feas which was synthesized under high pressure@xcite .",
    "the measurements of hall coefficients indicates that the carriers in the superconductors are electron - like . on the other hand , hole - doped ( la ,",
    "sr)o@xmath0f@xmath1feas was synthesized successfully with t@xmath5=26 k@xcite .",
    "transition - metal substituted lao@xmath0f@xmath1nias was also reported with t@xmath5=4 k and an extremely sharp superconducting transition@xcite .",
    "most recently , a very exciting result shows that a maximum t@xmath5 of 55k can be obtained even without f doping in the fe - based superconductors@xcite . up to now the record of the highest t@xmath5 56.5 k in iron - based superconductors",
    "was archived in gd@xmath0th@xmath1ofeas without f doping@xcite .",
    "it is believed that electrons are transferred into feas conducting layers effectively by th@xmath6 substitution of gd@xmath7 , just like f doping .",
    "this means that carrier concentration and superconducting transition temperature can be controlled and tuned by oxygen content and rare - earth substitution , which is much similar to the case of cuprate superconductors . a very high upper critical field over 100 t was estimated by resistance measurements under high magnetic field , even exceeding that of cuprate superconductors@xcite .",
    "the early band structure calculations suggested that the pure laofeas compound is a nonmagnetic metal but with strong ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic ( afm ) instability @xcite .",
    "later , it was found that the antiferromagnetically ordered state@xcite has a lower energy than the nonmagnetic one , due to the fermi surface nesting@xcite .",
    "it was then @xcite predicted that the afm state should form a striped structure by breaking the rotational symmetry , which was indeed observed by the neutron scattering experiment@xcite .",
    "the further theoretical studies show that the superexchange antiferromagnetic interaction between the next nearest neighbor fe - fe bridged by as is responsible for the stripe - ordered fe moments@xcite .",
    "some microscopic models have been constructed to understand the superconductivity in the compounds with iron - arsenite plane instead of copper - oxygen plane .",
    "there is no consensus on some important issues such as pairing mechanism and symmetry yet .",
    "more experimental efforts and further theoretical considerations are needed to reveal the properties of ground state and magnetic excitations .",
    "for the parent compounds without f doping , a subtle structural change and a successive magnetic transition were revealed by means of transport measurements , specific heat and neutron scattering etc .",
    "it is still a key issue to understand the connection between the structural change and magnetic transition .",
    "furthermore , exploring the driving force for pairing requires a basic knowledge on some important interactions such as electron - phonon coupling .",
    "so it is important and necessary to learn more detailed information on lattice vibrations in the compounds .",
    "raman scattering is known as a unique technique in studying optical phonon modes . besides , if allowed by selection rules , it is possible to obtain additional information about magnetic , electronic and other collective excitations .",
    "in fact , a nice raman scattering study on iron - based materials has been done on ab plane of single crystal grain by microscopic raman method@xcite .",
    "however the spectra only covered 100 to 400 @xmath4 and in - plane vibrations were not resolved due to the limit of ab plane .    in this paper , raman scattering measurements at room temperature from 30 to 2000 @xmath4 ,",
    "have been performed on two kinds of iron - based materials ceo@xmath0f@xmath1feas with x=0 ( t@xmath5=0 k ) and 0.16(t@xmath5=41",
    "k ) , and lao@xmath0f@xmath1feas with x=0 ( t@xmath5=0 k ) , 0.04(t@xmath5=17 k ) and x=0.08 ( t@xmath5=26 k ) , respectively .",
    "six raman phonon modes were observed below 500 @xmath4 . based on the structural data obtained by neutron scattering and x - ray diffraction , a group analysis was made to classify the optical modes .",
    "then first - principle calculations were carried out to calculate the optical modes at @xmath8 point . by comparison with the calculations and group analysis ,",
    "the observed phonon modes were assigned accordingly .",
    "the changes of some modes with f doping and rare - earth substitution were discussed . and",
    "electron - phonon coupling was found to be small .",
    "three weak features were observed above 500 @xmath4 , which may be associated with multi - phonon process , magnetic fluctuations or interband transitions .",
    "polycrystal samples of ceo@xmath0f@xmath1feas and lao@xmath0f@xmath1feas were synthesized by solid state reaction method . as precursor materials , ceas or laas",
    "were presynthesized by reacting ce or la chips and as pieces in an evacuated quartz tube .",
    "then feas was obtained with a similar process .",
    "using ceas / laas , fe , ceo@xmath9/la@xmath9o@xmath10 , cef@xmath10/laf@xmath10 and feas as starting materials , the raw materials with stoichiometric ratio were mixed thoroughly and pressed into pellets .",
    "the pellets were warped with ta foil and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube .",
    "almost pure phase polycrystal samples were obtained after annealing .",
    "the detailed procedure for preparing the samples can be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of susceptibility and resistivity of the polycrystal samples used in the present raman study is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the transition temperature width shows the high quality of the samples . for ceo@xmath0f@xmath1feas ,",
    "many shining single crystal grains can be seen even without a microscope . after polishing , a flat alloy - like surface can be obtained .",
    "unfortunately raman signal is too weak to be detected because most intensities of excitation light were reflected back by the alloy - like surface . in order to increase the intensities of incident light effectively and to resolve more phonon modes beyond ab plane ,",
    "the present raman measurements were done with ground fine powder .",
    "the raman measurements were performed with a triple - grating monochromator ( jobin yvon t64000 ) , which works with a microscopic raman configuration .",
    "a 50@xmath11 objective microscopic lens with a working distance of 10.6 mm , is used to focus the incident light on sample and collect the scattered light from sample .",
    "the detector is a back - illuminated ccd cooled by liquid nitrogen .",
    "an solid - state laser ( laser quantum torus 532 ) with high - stability and very narrow width of laser line , is used with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm .",
    "the laser beam of 3 mw was focused into a spot of less than 10 microns in diameter on sample surface .",
    "the refined structure parameters of laofeas have been obtained by neutron scattering and x - ray diffraction .",
    "it has a tetragonal zrcusias - type structure with space group p4/nmm ( no . 129 , origin choice 2 ) and point group d@xmath12 .",
    "atoms la , o / f , fe and as occupy    table i : classifications of optical modes of laofeas    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to assign the phonon modes at @xmath8-point , the phonon frequencies of non - magnetic laofeas crystal have been calculated in the framework of the density perturbation functional theory ( dfpt ) using plane - wave pseudopotentials @xcite with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga)of perdew - burke - ernzerh ( pbe)@xcite for the exchange - correlation potentials .",
    "firstly , a self - consistent calculation was accomplished using the experimental lattice parameters and the energy minimized internal atomic positions@xcite , during which the following parameters were adopted : the 45 and 360 ryd cutoffs of kinetic energy for wave - function and charge - density , respectively ; the 24@xmath1124@xmath1112 uniform k - space for the k - points integration ; and the gaussian smearing parameter of 0.002 ryd .",
    "then , by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix generated from converged potentials , we obtained the eigenvalues , namely the squared phonon frequencies , and the eigenvectors to derive the displacements of each atom in a specific vibration mode .",
    "eight frequency - distinguishable raman - active phonon modes were deduced at @xmath8-point , consisting of four two - fold degenerated e@xmath2 , two non - degenerated a@xmath3 and two non - degenerated b@xmath3 modes , which consists with the group symmetry analysis . comparing them to above raman spectra showed a fairly good agreement , see fig . 2 and tab .",
    "ii . all the raman active vibration modes are characterized in fig .",
    "3 , where the arrows indicate the vibration directions of the corresponding atoms , with their lengths representing the relative vibration amplitude compared with those of other atoms in the same mode .",
    "2 , at first glance laofeas system has a similar phonon spectrum for different f doping .",
    "there is no obvious frequency shift or change of peak shape for the three samples .",
    "however there still exist some small changes with varying f doping .",
    "both e@xmath2 mode at 96 @xmath4 and a@xmath3 mode at 161 @xmath4 of la are suppressed gradually with increasing f doping .",
    "it can be naturally understood as the effect of f dopants entering lao layer .",
    "the sensitivity of la phonon modes to f doping , may be considered as an alternative way to characterize the concentration of f doping .",
    "f doping has little effect on the fe and as - dominated phonon modes , such as b@xmath3 mode at 214 @xmath4 and e@xmath2 mode at 278 @xmath4 of fe , and e@xmath2 mode at 137 @xmath4 of as . the fact can be easily explained because f dopants are far away from feas layer and thus has little effect on fe and as - related vibrations .",
    "these three modes have a special significance in exploring the mechanism of magnetic phase transition near 140 k revealed by some experiments .",
    "as suggested by neutron scattering and other measurements , there also exists a structural changes just above the temperatures of magnetic phase transition . for iron - based superconductors ,",
    "it is still a key issue to make clear whether there is a connection between the magnetic transition and structural change or not .",
    "the modes related to fe and as would play an important role in answering the above question in further raman scattering measurements at various temperatures and with applied magnetic field .",
    "a relatively broad e@xmath2 mode of oxygen was observed near 423 @xmath4 for laofeas .",
    "we will come back to this point in combination with the results of ceofeas in the following .",
    "a striking change in the raman spectra of ceofeas is that the e@xmath2 phonon of oxygen becomes very strong and moves to 450 @xmath4 .",
    "the reason for the sharper oxygen e@xmath2 mode can be originated from a better sample quality of ceofeas as described above .",
    "interestingly , infrared measurements also observed a mode with quite high intensities near 430 @xmath4 in both laofeas and ceofeas , which moves to higher frequencies with decreasing temperatures , showing a typical phonon behavior@xcite .",
    "however , the first principle calculations show that there should be no ir - active mode above 400 @xmath4 .",
    "it is speculated that an inversion symmetry breaking can cause an intensity leakage of oxygen e@xmath2 mode into ir channel .",
    "if it is true , that means that a subtle structural distortion could occur even at room temperatures .",
    "the other change is that the modes below 200 @xmath4 contributed by la and as , can not be observed .",
    "this may be caused by the distortion of lao layer due to the substitution of la by smaller ce ions .",
    "the raman results based on single crystal are needed to confirm this point .    besides the above first - order raman phonons , there exist some common features above 500 @xmath4 in both laofeas and ceofeas , which are located at 590 @xmath4 , 846 @xmath4and 1300 @xmath4 .",
    "generally , these features originate from multi - phonon processes .",
    "for instance , the feature at 846 cm @xmath13 can be contributed by two e@xmath2 phonons of oxygen simply considering its frequency . on the other hand",
    ", the energies of features correspond to 73 , 105 and 161 mev , respectively .",
    "they are close to the interband differences of d orbitals@xcite , and also the ferromagnetic / antiferromagnetic exchange energies according to electronic structure calculations@xcite . at present",
    "it can not be ruled out that some of the features are associated with the interband transitions or magnetic fluctuations .",
    "further raman experiments under applied magnetic field could be helpful to answer this question .",
    "although polycrystal samples were used in the present measurements , it can be seen that electronic scattering background is low . and",
    "for the observed modes , especially those of fe and as , it is not easy to distinguish evident features of electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the measurements on single crystal are necessary in the further study on electronic raman scattering .",
    "in summary , raman measurements of newly discovered iron - based superconductors have been performed at room temperatures .",
    "the observed phonon modes are assigned in combination with symmetry analysis and first - principle calculations .",
    "the phonon modes are discussed in detail .",
    "the assignment will provide a basis for further study on structural and electronic properties and exploring the superconductivity in the high - t@xmath5 materials . besides the first - order raman phonons",
    ", more features found at higher frequencies may be related to magnetic excitations or interband transitions .",
