    "sim is designed as a space - based 10-m baseline michelson optical interferometer operating in the visible waveband .",
    "this mission will open up many areas of astrophysics , via astrometry with unprecedented accuracy . over a narrow field of view",
    "sim is expected to achieve a mission accuracy of 1 @xmath0as . in this mode sim",
    "will search for planetary companions to nearby stars by detecting the astrometric `` wobble '' relative to a nearby ( @xmath1 ) reference star . in its wide - angle mode",
    ", sim will be capable to provide a 4 @xmath0as   precision absolute position measurements of stars , with parallaxes to comparable accuracy , at the end of a 5-year mission .",
    "the expected proper motion accuracy is around 4 @xmath0as / yr , corresponding to a transverse velocity of 10  m / s at a distance of 1  kpc.@xcite    the sim instrument does not directly measure the angular separation between stars , but the projection of each star direction vector onto the interferometer baseline by measuring the pathlength delay of starlight as it passes through the two arms of the interferometer .",
    "the delay measurement is made by a combination of internal metrology measurements to determine the distance the starlight travels through each arm , and a measurement of the central white light fringe to determine the point of equal pathlength .",
    "sim surveys the sky in units called _",
    "tiles_. a tile is defined as a sequence of measured delays corresponding to multiple objects all made by a single baseline vector @xmath2 and central pointing of the instrument  that is , all the measurements in a tile are from objects that are within a single astrometric for ( field of regard of the instrument ) , which is approximately @xmath3 .",
    "the existence of a single baseline vector insures that the system of equations developed from the observations to extract the astrometric parameters is not underdetermined .",
    "however , the collection of such a measurement set with a single interferometer is actually impossible , as the data collection on a sequence of objects takes finite time , over which both the baseline length and orientation do not remain constant .",
    "this paper describes the fundamental steps of how the on  board instrumentation of external metrology and auxiliary guide interferometers are used to reconstruct the baseline vector sufficiently accurately so that it can effectively be modeled as a single vector over the period of a tile observation .",
    "this process has been previously referred to as the _ regularization _ of the baseline @xcite .",
    "the notion of the regularized baseline has been used extensively in a number of grid simulation studies that plan observation sequences , predict mission accuracy , and determine sensitivities to various instrument parameters @xcite .    the process of reconstructing the baseline vector when implemented onboard in real ",
    "time is termed pathlength feedforward , and is a critical component to the operation of the interferometer . because many of the astrometric targets will be very dim ,",
    "it is not possible for the science interferometer to track the fringes and compensate for optical pathlength difference variations in real time using the dim target as the signal . as a result",
    "the fringes associated with the science target will be washed out due to uncontrolled motions of the instrument .",
    "the adopted solution in these cases is to use precise attitude information obtained from the two guide interferometers and construct a delay tracking signal that will be fed to the science interferometer s delay line in an open loop fashion .",
    "this aspect of the baseline regularization process will be covered in some detail .",
    "an overview of the mission and several of the major subsystems of the instrument can be found in references @xcite",
    "sim is designed to measure the pathlength delay between the two arms of the interferometer .",
    "the instantaneous delay value is given formally by the interferometer astrometric equation : @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the external optical pathlength delay synthesized by a combination of internal metrology and white light fringe estimation , @xmath6 is the normal to the wavefront of the starlight ( the unit 3-vector to the observed object ) , @xmath2 is the baseline 3-vector , @xmath7 is a so - called constant ( or calibration ) term that represents possible optical path differences between the light collected from the target object and the internal metrology , and @xmath8 is the noise in the measurement .     +    because of limitations imposed by the optical throughput of the system and the brightness of the observed",
    "objects several seconds of integration time are necessary to bring the average white light fringe estimate to the required accuracy .",
    "thus , the actual instrument measurement is the following : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the average measured external delay obtained from internal metrology measurements and white light fringe estimation , @xmath11 is the average baseline vector over the period of the observation , and @xmath12 is the measurement noise .",
    "the fundamental objective of the instrument is to make these delay measurements so that the astrometric parameters of position , proper motion , and parallax can be ascertained for the stars that are observed .",
    "focusing just on the problem of estimating stellar positions , the astrometry problem is to determine the vector @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : del1 ] ) above .",
    "however , _ all _ of the quantities above on the right must be treated as unknown because of the @xmath0as level precision requirements of the instrument .",
    "( the hipparcos catalogue has an accuracy on the order of several mas for stellar positions , while standard attitude determination and alignment systems on spacecraft can determine the baseline vector to the order of an arcsec . )",
    "sim circumvents this difficulty by observing multiple stars , @xmath14 , within its field of regard so that the observation equations can be modeled as    @xmath15    the critical assumption here is that there is a single baseline vector , albeit unknown , that needs to be solved for as well as a single constant term .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ eq : del2 ] )",
    "consists of @xmath16 equations with @xmath17 unknowns .",
    "if a new baseline orientation is used to observe the same set of stars , an additional @xmath16 equations are obtained , but only at the expense of 4 additional unknowns necessary to determine the new baseline vector and constant term .",
    "it is evident with more observations the system of equations eventually becomes overdetermined so that the stellar positions can be resolved .",
    "applying this idea to a set of tiles that covers the entire celestial sphere is the kernel of sim s strategy to perform wide angle astrometry .    the observable in ( [ eq : del1 ] )",
    "is the average delay measurement made by the interferometer .",
    "considerable analysis , simulation and technology development and validation has been devoted to the problems of precision white light fringe estimation and metrology that are used to synthesize this observable.@xcite the focus of this paper is to show that the model equations eq .",
    "( [ eq : del2 ] ) are actually consistent with the data that is collected by the instrument . to see where a potential conflict may arise , observe that because the baseline vector is time  varying , the average position over the integration period changes from observation to observation .",
    "the resulting model over a tile is    @xmath18    the difficulty now is that there is a different ( unknown ) average baseline for each star ; violating the assumption made in ( [ eq : del2 ] ) .    in principle",
    "sim solves this problem by using guide interferometers and external metrology to track the baseline vector during the observations .",
    "the details of this process will be developed over the next two sections . here",
    "will give the overview of how this is done , specifically with respect to overcoming the difficulty posed in ( [ eq : del4 ] ) .",
    "sim uses two auxiliary guide interferometers that lock on bright `` guide '' stars ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , thereby keeping track of the directions to these stars , and hence also of the rigid - body motion of the instrument .",
    "the third interferometer switches between the science targets ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , measuring the projected angles between the targets and the interferometer baseline vector .",
    "an external metrology system keeps track of the flexible - body motions of the instrument by measuring changes in the baseline vectors of the three interferometers in a local frame , or equivalently , determining their relative orientations .    because the three interferometer baselines are not collinear , to complete the characterization of the rigid body behavior of the instrument",
    "a third inertial measurement is required .",
    "this measurement is termed the `` roll '' measurement . in the ideal case",
    "we show that the sim instrumentation is sufficient in the sense that in the absence of measurement errors and _ a priori _ parameter errors , the collection of measurements made by the guide interferometers , the roll measurement , the external metrology measurements together with the _ a priori _ parameter data consisting of the positions of the guide stars , the initial guide and science baseline vectors in the local frame , uniquely determine the baseline vector of the science interferometer in inertial space .    when this is the case the vector @xmath24 in ( [ eq : del4 ] ) is known for all @xmath25 . in reality",
    "there are both measurement errors and _ a priori _ parameter errors so it can never be assumed that the @xmath24 are known . for any parameter vector @xmath26 ,",
    "let @xmath27 be the estimate of the baseline vector using this parameter vector . in the absence of measurement error the sufficiency of the sim instrumentation",
    "is embodied in the statement that @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the true parameter vector .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the _ a priori _ parameter vector and write @xmath30 in section [ sec : regul ] we show that for @xmath31 sufficiently small @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constant vector ( so long as the guide interferometers are locked on the guide stars ) and @xmath34 is a residual variation that contributes a delay error much less than the magnitude of the measurement noise @xmath12 and can be ignored in the analysis .",
    "now we may write the instantaneous delay equation as @xmath35 let @xmath36 denote the _ a priori _ estimate of the position so that @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the correction vector that is sought . thus , after averaging @xmath39 the quantity on the left is termed the `` regularized delay '' and is the quantity that is synthesized from the sim instrumentation . and",
    "since @xmath40 is known and the contribution of the term containing @xmath41 can be ignored , the unknowns are the corrections to the science star positions and the correction to the baseline vector which is now a single constant vector over the entire tile . in this sense",
    "the idealized model equations in ( [ eq : del2 ] ) are correct .",
    "we will now get into the details of how @xmath42 is obtained from the measurements and _ a priori _ data . for this purpose",
    "it suffices to treat sim as a set of fiducials , @xmath43 .",
    "( here @xmath44 denotes euclidean 3space . ) in the sim reference design , shown in figure 1 , there are a total of six fiducials , and in a spacecraft local frame their coordinates are collected in the matrix @xmath45 ( with units in meters ) : @xmath46.\\ ] ] the @xmath47 row of @xmath48 defines the coordinates of @xmath49 .    the science interferometer baseline vector @xmath50 is defined as @xmath51 the auxiliary science baseline vector is defined by fiducials 3 and 4 .",
    "the guide interferometer baseline vector @xmath52 is defined @xmath53 and the `` roll '' vector is @xmath54    for any pair of vectors in @xmath44 , say @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the vector @xmath57 will denote the difference @xmath58 .",
    "thus , for example @xmath59 .",
    "our interests center around the evolution of the fiducials @xmath60 over a time period @xmath61 , where @xmath62 denotes the beginning of an observation of a tile and @xmath63 is the time of completion .",
    "the problem is solved using the on  board optical sensing systems that include the external metrology system , the guide star interferometers , and the roll estimator . the signals from these systems",
    "are briefly described next .    in the sim reference design",
    "relative distance measurements are made between each pair of fiducials except for the direct link connecting the active science interferometer fiducials .",
    "the observed variables associated with the external metrology system are @xmath64 these measurements are relative distance measurements , and ( [ ( 2.1 ) ] ) is valid for any choice of coordinate frame .",
    "thus , @xmath65 is determined in the local frame from ( [ eq : b_s ] ) .",
    "the problem is to find @xmath65 in the inertial frame .",
    "this connection is made with the guide interferometers .",
    "sim uses a pair of guide stars to produce two independent delay measurements per observation : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the position vector to guide star @xmath68 , with @xmath69 .",
    "the roll estimator produces a `` measurement '' similar to the guide interferometers .",
    "we designate a guide telescope for use as part of the roll estimation scheme , and let @xmath70 denote the line  of  sight vector of this telescope . next we introduce a fiducial rigidly attached to the telescope which is also measured by the external metrology system .",
    "let @xmath71 denote the vector connecting this fiducial with the fiducial mounted on the chosen guide telescope .",
    "the rigidity assumption is that @xmath72 where @xmath73 is constant for all values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 over the period of a tile observation .",
    "now we will describe how ( [ ( 2.1)])([(2.3 ) ] ) are used to characterize the evolution of @xmath65 in the inertial frame .",
    "first let us see what can be learned from the observations in ( [ ( 2.1 ) ] ) .",
    "set @xmath74 , and define @xmath75 as the function with components @xmath76 @xmath77 we seek the solution to the system of equations    @xmath78",

    "_ this is the fundamental result which links the local and inertial frames .",
    "the linear justification of this principle is that since @xmath83 and to first order @xmath89 it follows that @xmath90 must be in the kernel of @xmath91 , which can be characterized as the rigid body motions of the fiducial system .",

    "since the science baseline vector @xmath65 is known in local coordinates from external metrology measurements , the problem of determining @xmath65 in inertial coordinates is solved once we obtain @xmath79 , viz . @xmath95",
    "the equations for obtaining @xmath79 are provided by the guide interferometer measurements and the roll estimator .",

    "redundant equations are sufficient . )",
    "note that the roll estimator equation has essentially the same form as the guide equation .",
    "the correspondences are that the guide measurement is replaced by a constant value using the rigidity assumption of the structure connecting the fiducials used for roll , the inertial position of the guide star is replaced with the inertial line of sight vector of the telescope , and the guide interferometer baseline vector is replaced with roll vector connecting the two fiducials .",
    "as described above , there are two components to the problem of determining @xmath40 .",
    "the first part inverts the 1d external metrology measurements into position vectors computed in the spacecraft local frame for all of the fiducials .",

    "( [ eq:42 ] ) ) .",
    "the first term in the parenthesis is the usual form for the interferometric delay @xmath181 , which represents the constant delay at the beginning of the observations of the tile .",
    "the second term in this parenthesis is the feed - forward signal , @xmath175 , which is given in ( [ eq : delay2 ] ) .",
    "the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delay2 ] ) are the first- and second - order feed - forward signals that update the instantaneous attitude of the science interferometer s baseline vector as measured in the local inertial frame .",
    "the third term in this expression is the second order contribution introduced by the temporal changes in the baseline lengths of the two guide interferometers ( @xmath182 ) which are coupled to their initial misalignments ( @xmath183 ) with respect to the science interferometer s baseline vector .",
    "the next term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delay2 ] ) is due to the interaction between the first order feed - forward signal and the rigid - body motions of the entire extended structure .",
    "it s instantaneous contribution is given by the accumulated temporal drifts in the guide interferometers baselines orientation over the time ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "the last term  is the second order contribution of the science interferometer s baseline roll vector ( given by @xmath185 ) to the total science interferometer s delay .",
    "one of the results that immediately follows from the presented analysis is the criteria for choosing the positions of the guide stars in the tile . indeed",
    ", one may see that all the terms responsible for the feed - forward signal have the quantity @xmath186\\big)$ ] in the denominator , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : delay2 ] ) .",
    "this quantity is proportional to the volume of the tetrahedron constructed from the three vectors , namely the unit vector of baseline orientation @xmath187 and the directions to the two guide stars @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "as this quantity appears in the denominator , it is preferable to have it as large as possible , thus minimizing the first and second order terms .",
    "in addition , by minimizing their contributions , one minimizes the contribution of guide star position errors to the estimate of science delay .",
    "the sim reference design is near optimal in the sense that the guide stars are placed 90@xmath190 apart , with each guide star nearly orthogonal to the interferometer baseline vectors .",
    "when all the parameters used to determine the baseline vector via the prescription developed in section [ sec : solving ] are without error , then the estimate of the baseline vector is constructed without error . but this can never be the case , and in section [ sec : astrom ] we showed that it is sufficient that the error be constant .",
    "this is the linchpin idea for the operation of the instrument .",
    "+    in figure [ fig : fig3.1 ] the effect of 20 mas errors in the guide star directions are introduced in determining the baseline vector .",
    "the guide star position error results in an error in the estimate of the attitude motion of the system , leading in turn to an error in the baseline vector estimate .",
    "the @xmath151 axis error is observed to be on the order of .0.77 @xmath0 m .",
    "however , observe also that this value is highly stable with a peak to peak range of approximately 10 pm .",
    "thus although @xmath191 exhibits micron class error , the important aspect is that the error is very stable as required in ( [ eq : delta_p ] ) .",
    "this example provides corroboration of the notion of the regularization concept introduced in section 2 .",
    "now we proceed to give a more rigorous mathematical justification of regularization in the face of _ a priori _ parameter errors , such as the guide star position error discussed above .    returning to the prescription for determining @xmath40 in section [ sec : solving ] ,",
    "_ a priori _ values must be provided for the following parameters :    * guide interferometer parameters : *    * @xmath192 guide star position vectors ( @xmath193 * @xmath194 guide interferometer constant terms ( @xmath193    * roll estimator parameters : *    * @xmath195 inner  product of roll vector @xmath196 with guide telescope unit line  of  sight vector    * optical truss parameters : *    * @xmath197 initial vector of all fiducial positions in a s / c local frame    the totality of these parameters constitute the parameter vector @xmath26 , @xmath198 that is used to define the baseline estimate . in what follows",
    "we will assume the true parameter vector is @xmath199 while the nominal parameter vector is @xmath200 hence the error parameter vector is the difference @xmath201    we will now prove a `` weak '' version of regularization that asserts to first order ( the meaning of which is made more precise below ) the difference between the baseline estimate and the true baseline vector is constant",
    ". some comments on the second order errors that are ignored in this analysis are made at the end of this section .",
    "the following nomenclature will be used in the course of establishing the regularization result .    *",
    "zeroth order : * a quantity expressed in meters or radians ( e.g. the length of an interferometer baseline vector . )    * first order : * a quantity expressed in terms of um or @xmath0rad , or a product of a first order term with a zeroth order term ( e.g. , the magnitude of the elastic deformation of the optical truss , s / c attitude stability , guide star position error . )    * second order : * a product of first order quantities , or a product of a second order term with a zeroth order term .",
    "let @xmath202 denote the initial error in the science baseline vector stemming from the fiducial error term @xmath203 . also let @xmath204 denote the attitude rotation vectors in ( [ eq : om1])-([eq : om2 ] ) obtained using the parameter vector @xmath26 instead of the true vector @xmath29 .",

    "once we show that @xmath211 is constant to first order , we will be done since @xmath212 is constant to zeroth order ( its variations are due to elastic motions of the instrument ) .    with these definitions the true ( second order ) attitude equation",
    "is given by @xmath213 while the attitude equation using the parameter vector @xmath26 is @xmath214 where @xmath153 is defined in ( [ eq : y_martix ] ) and @xmath215,\\ ] ] with @xmath216,\\ ] ] @xmath217.\\ ] ] examining these terms it is seen that to first order @xmath218 is a constant .    the equations ( [ eq : e_dy1])([eq : e_dy2 ] ) are solved iteratively to obtain the true and estimated values of @xmath219 .",
    "thus we have @xmath220,\\ ] ] and @xmath221 hence , @xmath222 because @xmath223 is a constant matrix to first order and @xmath218 is constant to first order , it follows that @xmath224 is also constant to first order ; as was to be shown .",
    "it is possible to develop very specific forms for the second order error terms due to these initialization errors , but this is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we remark that these errors do drive certain requirements in the sim astrometric error budget .",
    "for example there is a relatively strong coupling between the initial fiducial error @xmath225 and attitude motion that produces a second order delay error of the form @xmath226\\cdot \\vec{s}.\\ ] ] in figure [ fig : fig3.2 ] we plot this delay regularization error for a `` typical '' case arising from a single gauge absolute metrology error of 5 @xmath0 m in determining the fiducial positions and a 2 arcsec single axis rigid body motion generated from a random rotation direction with a 10 @xmath0rad amplitude sinusoidal motion .",
    "the plot contains the associated delay error for a typical star within the field of regard of the science interferometer . if the abscissa is the time ",
    "axis in seconds , and say a 15 sec observation of the star is made , then the delay error of the observation would be the average value over that particular 15 sec period .",
    "the observation period could be at the _ extremes _ of the motion , producing a delay error of @xmath227 pm , or it could be centered around zero producing zero delay error .",
    "in fact any delay error could be attained within this envelope .",
    "requirements are set to keep this envelope small .",
    "sim astrophysical science is extracted from a model set of equations that relate the measured optical pathlength delay to the projection of the interferometer baseline vector onto the star direction vector .",
    "these equations presuppose that the interferometer baseline is fixed in inertial space ; which it is not .",
    "the main objective of this paper has been to introduce the reader to the concepts and the instrumental logic of the sim astrometric observations , especially as they relate to the fundamental operation of baseline regularization that `` fixes '' the interferometer in inertial space .",
    "mathematical arguments were presented to establish this fundamental principle and a precise definition of regularization was given .",
    "the underlying nonlinear system of equations that is the basis for regularization was derived and numerical methods to solve them were obtained .",
    "a simulation was also developed incorporating the numerical processing methods of the instrument observables and the results were shown to conform with the theory .    beyond demonstrating the sim proof of principle",
    ", the regularization equations presented here also form the kernel of the extensive instrument error budget . the linearized version of these equations are used to determine the propagation of noise from external metrology measurements and guide star delay measurements to the science delay error .",
    "this error is determined by the geometry of the optical truss together with its orientation in inertial space with respect to the guide star and target star positions .",
    "the propagation factors are used to set requirements on the integration time of observations , single gauge metrology error , etc .",
    "the regularization equations also reveal the existence of a number of second order errors that arise in the form of products of fiducial motion ( elastic and rigid body ) and initial parameter error .",
    "examples of errors of this type were given .",
    "current work focuses on the mechanisms and effects of variation of the `` constant '' terms in the astrometric delay equations .",
    "nominally the appearance of the constant term compensates for the lack of a precise internal metrology gauge that measures the absolute distance between the interferometer aperture fiducials to the beam combiner . however , there are a number of instrument errors that are collected into this single term .",
    "for example as the interferometer observes stars within its field of regard several optical elements must be translated and rotated .",
    "these induce non ",
    "trivial diffraction effects , metrology gauge error due to imperfect corner cubes , reflection phase errors because of a changing angle of incidence of the interrogating metrology beams , and others .",
    "each of these effects must be played through the delay regularization equations to ascertain their ultimate effect on delay error .",
