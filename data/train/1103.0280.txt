    "in recent years , galaxy clusters have emerged as one of the unique and powerful laboratories for cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "being the largest and most magnificent structures in the universe , clusters of galaxies serve as excellent tracers of the growth of cosmic structures .",
    "current generation of x - ray cluster surveys have provided independent confirmation of cosmic acceleration and significantly tighten constraints on the nature of dark energy @xcite and alternative theories of gravity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "new x - ray survey missions ( e.g. , _ erosita _ ) are underway to improve current cosmological constraints",
    ".    outskirts of galaxy clusters have special importance in cluster cosmology , because they are believed to be much less susceptible to complicated cluster astrophysics , such as radiative gas cooling , star formation , and energy injection from active galactic nuclei .",
    "dominant physical processes in the outskirts are limited to the gravity - driven collisionless dynamics of dark matter and hydrodynamics of the intracluster medium ( icm ) . however , until very recently , observational studies of the icm have been limited to radii considerably smaller than the virial radius of clusters .",
    "recently , x - ray observations with _",
    "suzaku _ have extended measurements of the icm profile out to and beyond the virial radius for a number of clusters @xcite . while measurement uncertainties are still large , the initial results indicate that the observed icm profiles deviate significantly from the predictions of hydrodynamical cluster simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to testing model of structure formation , these new measurements are important for controlling systematic uncertainties for cluster - based cosmological measurements .    in the hierarchical structure formation model ,",
    "clusters grow by accreting materials from the surrounding large - scale structure in their outer envelope .",
    "numerical simulations predict that accretion and mergers are ubiquitous and important for cluster formation , and the accretion physics gives rise to internal gas motions and inhomogeneous gas density distribution ( `` clumpiness '' ) in the icm .",
    "recent hydrodynamical simulations , for example , indicate that non - thermal pressure provided by gas motions significantly modifies the icm profiles in the cluster outskirts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "gas clumping , on the other hand , also introduces biases the x - ray measurements of the icm .",
    "@xcite , for example , pointed out that gas clumping can lead to an overestimate of the icm mass by @xmath1 around half of the virial radius .",
    "however , the impact of gas clumping on cluster outskirts has received little attention in the literature .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate effects of gas clumping on x - ray measurements in the outskirts of galaxy clusters . using hydrodynamical cluster simulations , we show that gas clumping leads to an overestimate of gas density and causes flattening of the entropy profile in cluster outskirts ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "our results suggest that gas clumping should be treated properly when interpreting x - ray measurements in the envelop of galaxy clusters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe our simulations in section  [ sec : sim ] and define the clumping factor in section  [ sec : clumping ] . in section  [ sec : results ] we present our results .",
    "our main findings are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this work , we analyze a sample of 16 simulated groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "the simulations presented here are presented in @xcite and @xcite , and we refer the reader to these papers for more details .",
    "we briefly summarize relevant parameters of the simulations here .",
    "these simulations are performed using the adaptive refinement tree ( art ) @xmath3-body@xmath4gas - dynamics code @xcite , which is an eulerian code that uses adaptive refinement in space and time , and non - adaptive refinement in mass @xcite to achieve the dynamic ranges to resolve the cores of halos formed in self - consistent cosmological simulations .",
    "the simulations assume a flat @xmath0cdm model : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where the hubble constant is defined as @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the mass variance within spheres of radius @xmath11  mpc .",
    "the simulations were run using a uniform @xmath12 grid with 8 levels of mesh refinement .",
    "the box size for cl101cl107 is @xmath13  mpc comoving on a side and is @xmath14  mpc comoving for cl3cl24 .",
    "this corresponds to peak spatial resolution of @xmath15  kpc and @xmath16  kpc for the two box sizes respectively .",
    "only the inner regions @xmath17  mpc surrounding the cluster center were adaptively refined .",
    "the dark matter ( dm ) particle mass in the region around each cluster was @xmath18 for cl101107 and @xmath19 for cl324 , while other regions were simulated with a bottom mass resolution .    to assess the effects of galaxy formation on gas clumping , we compare two sets of clusters simulated with the same initial conditions but with different prescription of gas physics . in the first set , we performed hydrodynamical cluster simulations without gas cooling and star formation .",
    "we refer this set of clusters as non - radiative ( nr ) clusters . in the second set",
    ", we turn on the physics of galaxy formation , such as metallicity - dependent radiative cooling , star formation , supernova feedback and a uniform uv background .",
    "we refer this set of clusters as cooling+star formation ( csf ) clusters .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed description of the gas physics implemented in these simulations .",
    "our simulated sample includes 16 clusters at @xmath20 and their most massive progenitors at @xmath21 .",
    "the properties of the simulated clusters at @xmath20 are given in table  1 of @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use the radius @xmath22 in which the enclosed mean overdensity is @xmath23 times the critical density at the redshift of the output .",
    "the cluster center is defined as the location of the most bounded dark matter particle . to study the dependence on the dynamical state of clusters , we distinguish unrelaxed and relaxed clusters based on the overall morphology of the mock x - ray images discussed in @xcite .",
    "in the icm , x - ray photons are emitted primarily by the scattering of electrons off ions via thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the cooling function which depends on temperature @xmath26 and metallicity @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the mean molecular weight of electrons and hydrogen , @xmath30 is the proton mass , @xmath31 is the gas density , and @xmath32 is the volume .",
    "since @xmath25 depends weekly on @xmath26 and @xmath33 , the observed x - ray surface brightness profile depends primarily on the average of gas density squared , @xmath34 where we define the clumping factor as , @xmath35 note that @xmath36 , if the icm is not clumpy ( i.e. , a single phase medium characterized by one temperature and gas density within each radial bin ) .    in x - ray analyses of galaxy clusters , it is commonly assumed that the icm is not clumpy . by setting @xmath36 , the three dimensional gas density distribution is derived from the observed x - ray surface brightness profile by inverting eq .",
    "[ eq : sx2 ] . however , if the icm is clumpy , the gas density inferred from the x - ray surface brightness is overestimated by @xmath37 . in",
    "what follows , we investigate the clumping factor of the x - ray emitting icm using hydrodynamical cluster simulations .",
    "in figure  [ fig : clump ] we plot the gas clumping factor as a function of radius for the sample of 16 simulated galaxy clusters .",
    "results for the csf and nr runs are shown in the top and bottom panels respectively .",
    "since we are primarily interested in the x - ray emitting icm , we consider gas with temperature @xmath38  k here .",
    "we checked that the results based on @xmath38  k cut is essentially identical to the calculation that takes into account the energy - dependent effective area of the suzaku xis instrument .",
    "we thus apply the temperature cut of @xmath38  k when comparing to the x - ray data , unless stated otherwise .",
    "figure  [ fig : clump ] shows very large cluster - to - cluster variations , ranging between @xmath39 .",
    "as we illustrate below , these peaks correspond to high - density , low - temperature gas associated with infalling groups and galaxies .",
    "the amplitude of these peaks are generally more pronounced in the unrelaxed systems .",
    "the scatter is larger in the csf runs than in the nr runs , because gas condensation in infalling groups and satellites creates higher - density , lower - temperature gas that enhances the clumping factor . in",

    "the clumping factor increases rapidly with radius , reaching @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the csf and nr runs respectively .",
    "note that the clumping factor of hot gas ( @xmath49  k ) is smaller in the csf runs than in the nr runs , because some of the hot gas is cooled out of the x - ray band ( see figure  [ fig : clump_phase ] ) .",
    "the clumping factor is generally larger in the unrelaxed systems , due to the enhanced level of substructures . since the csf runs suffer from the ` overcooling ' problem ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we argue that the real clumping factor should be bracketed by the results of our csf and nr runs .",
    "to investigate the dependence on gas temperature , we compute the clumping factor profiles for several different temperature thresholds . figure  [ fig : clump_phase ] shows the median clumping factor profiles calculated for gas with @xmath38  k and @xmath50  k , and for gas of all temperatures . for the x - ray emitting gas ( e.g. , @xmath51  k ) , the clumping factor is considerably smaller in the csf runs than in the nr runs . in",
