    "modern cosmology boasts a best - fit model which is in good agreement with a variety of data .",
    "this model features a homogeneous and isotropic spatially - flat universe comprised of approximately @xmath1  baryons , @xmath2  cold dark matter , and @xmath3  vacuum energy , with a radiation energy density of about @xmath4 at a temperature @xmath5  k. along with a nearly scale - free spectrum of adiabatic density perturbations , these ingredients provide an accurate match to observations of the recent expansion history @xcite , large - scale structure @xcite , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , and the abundances of light elements as predicted by big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite .",
    "as successful as the best - fit model has been , it falls short of achieving an aura of inevitability due to certain problems of naturalness .",
    "foremost among these are the two cosmological constant problems : why the vacuum energy is so small in comparison to its expected value , and why its precise magnitude is so close to that of the matter energy density today @xcite .",
    "in addition to these unsolved problems , there are problems for which a popular solution exists but is lacking a firm experimental footing : the flatness and horizon problems , which may be solved by inflation , and of course the nature of the dark - matter itself . finally , amidst the large successes",
    "there are small failures of the best - fit model in fitting the data , especially in the detailed matching of structure on small scales to the predictions of cold dark matter @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , numerous alternatives to conventional cosmology have been studied .",
    "to take one recent example , brane - world models with large extra dimensions can give rise to a variety of departures from four - dimensional general relativity , with important consequences for the early universe @xcite .",
    "given this situation , it is worth examining as carefully as possible the theoretical assumptions of the standard cosmological model , if for no other reason than to reassure ourselves that its apparent fine - tunings are not pointing toward a radically different underlying framework . in this paper",
    "we consider the empirical evidence relating to the friedmann equation , the dynamical relation in general relativity between the expansion rate of the universe and the energy density in it .",
    "the fundamental quantity in general relativity is the space - time metric .",
    "we have some empirical evidence for the form of the metric from astronomical observations .",
    "we know that the universe is expanding @xcite , the physical volume of the universe is increasing with time .",
    "we also know that the cosmic microwave background is isotropic to a part in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to assume that the spatial metric is isotropic .",
    "if we further assume that all observers ( matter ) in this expanding isotropic universe see the same cmb isotropy , then it follows @xcite that the universe is homogeneous ( on scales much larger than that of the largest collapsed structure ) .",
    "the metric is then uniquely determined .",
    "the form of this metric , called the robertson - walker ( rw ) metric , is ds^2 = -dt^2 + a^2(t )  , [ rwmetric ] where @xmath7 is the scale factor and @xmath8 is the curvature parameter .",
    "the friedmann equation ( derived from general relativity for the rw metric ) is h^2 = ( a a)^2 = 8 g 3 -k a^2  .",
    "[ feq ] @xmath9 is the hubble expansion rate and @xmath10 the energy density of the universe .",
    "in fact ( [ feq ] ) is only the @xmath11 component of einstein s equations applied to ( [ rwmetric ] ) ; we also have another independent gravitational equation , = -4g3(+ 3p ) [ feq2 ]  , as well as an equation of energy - momentum conservation , = -3 ( + p)a a  , [ emcons ] where @xmath12 is the pressure . in seeking to test this framework ,",
    "we might hope to seek consistency relations among these equations , which could be compared with data .",
    "unfortunately , it is always possible to find an energy density @xmath13 and pressure @xmath14 which satisfy ( [ feq]-[emcons ] ) .",
    "specifically , any given expansion history @xmath7 and curvature @xmath15 is compatible with these equations if we choose & = & 38 g + p & = & - 18 g  .",
    "the crucial point here is that a perfectly smooth component of energy and pressure can not be detected in any way except for its influence on the expansion rate , so we have no independent constraint on such a source .",
    "while invoking a perfectly smooth component to fit an arbitrary behavior of the scale factor might seem like cheating , this is exactly what we must do to reconcile the strong evidence in favor of spatial flatness with the similarly strong evidence that the amount of clustered matter falls far short of the critical density in the current universe . in this sense ,",
    "the set of equations ( [ feq]-[emcons ] ) are , strictly speaking , untestable , without some prior expectation for the nature of @xmath10 and @xmath12 .    instead",
    ", we can characterize what observations can tell us about the behavior of the scale factor in a model - independent way , so that any specific alternative theory can be straightforwardly compared with the data .",
    "there are only two eras of the universe s history in which such a characterization is possible : the recent universe , and the bbn era . in the recent universe ,",
    "information about the behavior of the scale factor can be obtained in a variety of ways , most directly by comparing the distance of faraway objects to their redshifts , as is done in the supernova studies that first revealed the acceleration of the universe @xcite . during bbn",
    ", the expansion rate directly affects the relative abundances of light elements produced ( as reviewed below ) , so that the primordial abundances are a powerful constraint on alternative expansion histories .",
    "other important observable phenomena which are affected by the expansion rate do not offer such a direct test , since they typically involve the local behavior of gravity ( evolution of perturbations ) in addition to its cosmological behavior ( evolution of the scale factor ) .",
    "examples include the growth of large - scale structure and the imprinting of temperature anisotropies on the cmb .",
    "a theory which predicts deviations from the friedmann equation could generically predict deviations from the predictions of general relativity on other scales .",
    "consequently , it is difficult to use the growth of structure and cmb anisotropies as model - independent tests of the friedmann equation , although any fully - specified alternative theory might be tightly constrained by these phenomena .",
    "however , if one assumes that the local behavior of gravity as predicted by general relativity is correct , then structure formation and cmb anisotropies are a powerful probe of the expansion history ( and hence dark energy evolution ) after the last scattering epoch @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will study what kinds of expansion histories in the early universe are compatible with the bbn explanation of the light element abundances .",
    "other works have constrained the energy density @xcite or value of newton s constant @xcite during bbn , assuming the friedmann equation , or have derived bbn constraints on specific scalar - tensor theories @xcite or have put limits on alternative cosmologies under the assumption that the universe has undergone a consistent power - law evolution from very early times @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the constraints imposed by bbn ( by considering the change in the neutron - proton freeze - out temperature ) and structure formation on cosmologies where the energy density in the universe varies as some power of @xmath0 has also been calculated @xcite",
    ". our approach will be not to assume any specific behavior of the scale factor over long periods , but instead to introduce a two - parameter family of evolution histories which we take to be valid only in the vicinity of bbn .",
    "we find that a variety of alternative cosmologies can be consistent with observations , although they comprise essentially a one - dimensional region in our two - dimensional space of possibilities .",
    "we will consider theories in which the field equations for the metric may be different from those of general relativity , but we assume that test particles will still follow geodesics of this metric . from this assumption",
    "it follows that the energy of a relativistic particle redshifts as @xmath16 . the photon temperature will be proportional to @xmath16 in the absence of entropy creation ; however , @xmath17 annihilation can act as a significant entropy source .",
    "we therefore use the neutrino temperature @xmath18 as a measure of the scale factor , since @xmath19 to excellent accuracy during the epoch under consideration . of",
    "course these statements rely on our decision to only consider changes in the gravitational dynamics , not any particle - physics processes .",
    "the process of conventional bbn spans temperatures between the freeze - out of weak interactions , @xmath20 , and the synthesis of helium , @xmath21 ; this corresponds to a change in the scale factor by slightly more than one order of magnitude .",
    "it will therefore be reasonable to approximate the expansion rate during this interval , so long as it is not wildly oscillating or somehow finely tuned , as a simple power law : h(t ) = ( t1 ) ^ h_1  .",
    "[ param ] any expansion history is parameterized by the coefficient @xmath22 and the exponent @xmath23 .",
    "( one can view this as a taylor expansion in @xmath24 , to first order in @xmath25 . )",
    "we do not extend this parameterization beyond the bbn epoch , nor are we proposing any models in which ( [ param ] ) is predicted ( but note that all the models in @xcite are well described by this expansion law ) ; this is a phenomenological study of the expansion rate during bbn .",
    "it should also be noted that there might exist models which are not accurately described by power - law expansion during the bbn era @xcite ; in such cases it would be necessary to examine each model individually .",
    "in standard bbn weak interactions freeze out close to @xmath20 , at which point @xmath26 . at temperatures lower than @xmath27 , the only change in the neutron to proton ratio occurs due to free decay of neutrons with a lifetime of @xmath28 . at temperatures",
    "much lower than freeze - out , it becomes possible to synthesize helium in appreciable quantities .",
    "this happens at a temperature of @xmath29 , and essentially all the remaining neutrons ( one per seven protons ) are bound into helium nuclei .",
    "it should be noted that this temperature ( @xmath30 ) is much lower than the binding energies of all the light elements .",
    "clearly , the large photon to baryon ratio ( which implies a large photo - dissociating background ) is partly responsible for this @xcite .",
    "the rate at which @xmath31  conversion occurs depends on the destruction rate of deuterium which in turn depends on the binding energy of deuterium , the formation rate of tritium and the baryon to photon ratio . in standard bbn , it turns out that the conditions for helium synthesis are just right when the helium formation rate is larger than @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "this picture breaks down in the unconventional expansion histories we consider .",
    "an understanding of how alternative models affect light - element abundances can be expressed in terms of the behavior of three characteristic quantities : the freeze - out temperature @xmath27 ( which sets the initial neutron / proton ratio ) , the time interval between freeze - out and nucleosynthesis , @xmath33 ( during which neutrons decay ) , and the hubble parameter at nucleosynthesis , @xmath34 ( which affects the efficiency with which neutrons are converted to helium , and thus determines the deuterium and lithium abundances ) .",
    "note that @xmath35 , since @xmath36 ; this will continue to be true in the non - standard models we study . assuming only that @xmath0 is monotonically decreasing even prior to the epoch when this formula is relevant",
    ", we will have t_bbn= 1 h_bbn  .",
    "the predictions of big - bang nucleosynthesis are given as ratios of abundances of the light elements  neutrons ( n ) , protons ( p or h ) , deuterium ( d ) , , ,  and .",
    "one quotes the ratio of the number density of the light elements to the number of protons , except in the case of helium where the accepted practice is to quote its mass fraction ( ) .",
    "the absolute density of these light elements is set by the absolute density of baryons .",
    "the only input parameter in standard bbn is the baryon density quoted as its ratio ( @xmath37 ) to the number density of photons .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath38 since the number density of baryons ( compared to that of photons ) is very small . except for a brief period when electrons and positrons annihilate ,",
    "@xmath37 remains constant ( provided no other entropy changing interactions come into equilibrium ) .",
    "we will adopt observationally allowed ranges of light elements ratios in keeping with the inferences ( but slightly on the conservative side ) of olive  @xcite .",
    "the ranges are @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the low deuterium value has been adopted since it seems to be favored by current data @xcite .",
    "the baryon density is not as well constrained observationally as the ratios of light element abundances .",
    "one reason for this is that we can only inventory the baryons that we see and most of the baryons could be dark .",
    "even putting a lower bound on the baryon density is a difficult task .",
    "persic and salucci @xcite estimated the density of baryons in the universe ( in terms of @xmath42 ) to be @xmath43 . in converting the baryon density to @xmath37",
    "we have assumed that @xmath37 has remained constant since bbn ( as it does in the standard model ) , and that @xmath44 @xcite where @xmath45 is the present expansion rate of the universe .",
    "fukugita  @xcite also did a baryon inventory and their bound on the baryon density translates to @xmath46 , a much higher lower bound on the baryon density .",
    "we will use both these lower bounds as a way of showing how the allowed region changes with the bound on the baryon density .    without recourse to a specific theory of gravity",
    "it is not possible to put an upper bound on the baryon density . for our purposes",
    ", we will assume the following ranges for the baryon density  a tight bound corresponding to @xmath47 and a broader range with @xmath48 .",
    "we will also comment on what happens if the upper bound on the baryon density is increased .",
    "the requirement that about 24% helium by mass be synthesized imposes severe constraints on the expansion history for temperatures around @xmath30 . to understand these constraints",
    ", it proves useful to look at the effects of changes in the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 of ( [ param ] ) in the vicinity of the standard model .",
    "we first concentrate on the effect of changing @xmath22 at fixed @xmath23 .",
    "as mentioned , the important considerations are the freeze - out temperature @xmath27 , and the time interval between freeze - out and nucleosynthesis @xmath35 .",
    "( in the vicinity of standard bbn , small changes in the expansion rate @xmath34 will not be important , since essentially all neutrons are converted to helium . ) increasing @xmath22 increases the expansion rate at every temperature ; thus , freeze - out will occur earlier ( @xmath27 will be higher ) leading to a larger initial neutron / proton ratio . at the same time",
    ", the faster expansion rate leads to a decrease in @xmath49 , leaving less time for neutrons to decay .",
    "both these effects go in the same direction and hence the neutron / proton ratio at @xmath30 increases with increasing @xmath22 , leading to a higher helium abundance .",
    "one can analyze the effect of changing @xmath23 at fixed @xmath22 in a similar manner .",
    "again , the relevant considerations in the vicinity of standard bbn are the behaviors of @xmath27 and @xmath50 .",
    "since @xmath22 corresponds to a temperature close to freeze - out and before helium synthesis , increasing @xmath23 means that the expansion rate will be lower during nucleosynthesis . in particular",
    "this implies that @xmath34 will be lower ( helium synthesis happens later ) , and hence that the time interval @xmath51 will be longer .",
    "consequently , increasing @xmath23 at fixed @xmath22 gives neutrons more time to decay between @xmath27 and @xmath52 , working to decrease the helium abundance for values close to the standard ones .",
    "we can therefore balance the effects of increasing @xmath22 against those of increasing @xmath23 , to obtain a constant helium abundance for small deviations from the standard picture .",
    "in figure [ helium ] we plot contours of constant  in the @xmath23-@xmath22 plane .",
    "this figure reveals the expected behavior in the vicinity of the standard model , but we see that the curves turn over , and at fixed @xmath23 there is a larger value of @xmath22 for which the helium abundance is the same .",
    "this feature has been previously noted in the context of exploring the effects of very large numbers of light neutrino species ( and thus @xmath22 ) @xcite and in the explorations of bbn constraints on scalar - tensor theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "for very large @xmath22 , the freeze - out temperature is sufficiently high that @xmath53 asymptotes to unity ; @xmath50 continues to decrease as @xmath22 increases , leading to an ever - larger neutron fraction at nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , @xmath34 also increases and eventually the expansion rate at nucleosynthesis is so large that there is not enough time to efficiently turn the neutrons into helium .",
    "thus , given the success of standard bbn , there will be an additional larger value of @xmath22 ( at the standard value @xmath54 ) for which the helium abundance is the same .",
    "this argument can be generalized not just to other values of @xmath23 but also to the other light element abundances .",
    "one expects ( at fixed @xmath23 ) to get two values of @xmath34 which produce the same abundance .",
    "the deuterium abundance provides an important additional constraint on the allowed parameter space . in the standard picture deuterium",
    "is a by - product of neutrons getting burnt to helium .",
    "since the abundance of deuterium is set by its destruction rate and the time available for this destruction , it is extremely sensitive to the expansion rate at temperatures close to @xmath30 . around the standard model , d / h increases with @xmath22 for a fixed @xmath23 , since the time available for nucleosynthesis decreases .",
    "if one fixes @xmath22 , the decrease in post - bbn ( @xmath55 ) expansion rate causes d / h to decrease with increasing @xmath23 .",
    "once again we see that there is a trade - off to be made between @xmath23 and @xmath22 , and hence it is possible to increase @xmath23 and @xmath22 simultaneously such that we end up with the same deuterium abundance .",
    "this is borne out by the contours of constant deuterium plotted in figure [ deuterium ] .",
    "note that one expects exactly the opposite behavior with respect to changes in @xmath23 ( with @xmath22 fixed ) , and @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 fixed ) for the upper branch of contour plot . essentially , the abundances in the upper branch of the contour plot increase if the time available for nucleosynthesis goes up .    from figure [ deuterium",
    "] it is clear that the lower branch of the contour plot turns over at large @xmath23 .",
    "this can be traced to the appearance of a new production channel .",
    "as @xmath23 increases without a corresponding exponential increase in @xmath22 , the time available for nucleosynthesis becomes very large , and consequently deuterium is almost completely destroyed . in the lower branch",
    "this implies that beyond a certain value of @xmath23 it would not be possible to produce a reasonable d / h abundance .",
    "however , if the age of the universe gets large enough it becomes possible to produce deuterium by pp fusion , in a manner similar to what happens in the sun .",
    "this pp burning explains the turn over towards smaller values of @xmath22 in the lower branch of the deuterium contour .",
    "for this solution to work , the age during nucleosynthesis has to be of the order of billions of years .",
    "we , therefore , consider this solution highly unlikely and do not include it in our analysis .    for our parameter space around the standard model",
    "we expect the same behavior with respect to @xmath37 as in standard bbn . all other things being the same , increasing @xmath37 decreases deuterium abundance while increasing @xmath56 due to more efficient nucleosynthesis .",
    "thus at fixed @xmath23 if @xmath37 is increased , then one needs to decrease @xmath22 to lower the helium abundance back to where it was . in the case of deuterium ,",
    "if @xmath37 is increased at fixed @xmath23 , then one needs to increase @xmath22 in order to increase d / h back to where it was .",
    "note that for the upper branch one would have to increase @xmath22 at fixed @xmath23 to compensate for an increase in @xmath37 for _ both _ helium and deuterium , since both @xmath56 and d / h increase with @xmath37 in the upper branch .    we can infer the primordial abundance of  very accurately from poor - metallicity stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , it provides an additional constraint on our parameter space . for most of the parameter space ,",
    "getting helium right automatically ensures that lithium is near the observed abundance .",
    "even so , with the very tight bounds on /h that we impose , lithium does provide strong constraints .",
    "figure [ lithium ] shows contours of constant lithium in the @xmath22@xmath23 plane .",
    "its behavior with respect to a change in @xmath37 follows that of helium .",
    "the  iso - abundance contour has two interesting features not present in the helium contour , which can be traced to the fact that has two distinct production channels .",
    "can be produced through the reaction ( , @xmath57 ) , and through ( , @xmath57)with the subsequent beta - decay of .",
    "fixing our attention on the lower branch of the lithium contour , as we move from low to high @xmath23 , the dominant production channel changes from the direct channel to the indirect  one .",
    "the kink in the lower branch of the contour is at values of @xmath23 where this transition takes place . at large @xmath23 and @xmath22",
    ", there is a small closed contour below the upper branch . for a fixed @xmath23 in the region spanning the width of the small closed contour ,",
    "there are three values of @xmath22 which produce the required lithium abundance .",
    "the solution with the lowest value of @xmath22 produces  through the indirect  channel . in the upper branch of the contour  production",
    "is through the direct channel , for all values of @xmath23 .",
    "a larger @xmath22 means shorter time for nucleosynthesis and since  is easier to burn than , the direct channel dominates .",
    "putting together all of our constraints yields the allowed region shown in figure [ final ] .",
    "we note that the allowed region is essentially one dimensional , and is characterized by an almost linear relationship between @xmath58 and @xmath23 .",
    "this tells us that there must exist a temperature @xmath59 at which the expansion rate @xmath60 is approximately fixed for all the models in the allowed range . in other words",
    ", we must have h_1= h_c(t_c/)^ ; h_c=(0.039 0.013 ) / t_c=0.2 .",
    "[ hc ] the range of @xmath60 quoted in eq .",
    "[ hc ] corresponds to our conservative limits on the baryon to photon ratio . for the case with the tighter bound on baryon density ,",
    "we obtain @xmath61 .",
    "the value of @xmath59 reflects of the physics involved .",
    "is primarily sensitive to @xmath22 ( as well as to @xmath23 ) , while the other elements ( which can be viewed as by - products of the neutron to helium burning process ) are mainly sensitive to @xmath34 .",
    "thus , not surprisingly , we have @xmath62 .",
    "the coincidence that @xmath59 is so close to the @xmath17 annihilation temperature ( @xmath63 ) implies that the expansion rate of the universe during @xmath17 annihilation must have been close to the standard bbn value .",
    "this in turn implies that the cosmic microwave background will retain a black body spectrum through the annihilation epoch ( as in standard bbn ) in all the viable non - standard expansion histories we have identified .",
    "the effect of a change in the assumed range of the baryon density on the bounds on @xmath23 is visible in figure [ final ] .",
    "decreasing the lower bound on @xmath37 increases the upper bound on @xmath23 , while allowing for larger baryon densities implies a smaller lower bound on @xmath23 .",
    "the reason behind such behavior is not hard to understand . given that the expansion rate at 0.2 @xmath64 is approximately fixed , a viable expansion history with larger @xmath23 has lower @xmath34",
    ". a lower @xmath34 ( more time for nucleosynthesis ) at fixed baryon density implies a lower deuterium abundance .",
    "thus one requires a smaller baryon density to get deuterium abundance right in the limit of large @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , decreasing the lower bound on @xmath23 requires larger baryon densities .    as discussed before",
    ", we do not really have an observational upper bound on the baryon density of the universe in the absence of a theory of gravity .",
    "the lower bound is on a more sound footing because we can count the visible baryons .",
    "thus it seems pertinent to ask what happens if one allows for larger cosmological baryon densities . from our arguments above we would expect viable models with smaller values of @xmath23 .",
    "however , increasing @xmath42 above 50 ( panel 2 of figure [ final ] ) has _ no effect _ on the allowed range of @xmath23 .",
    "the reason behind this result is best understood through the following qualitative picture . at smaller values of @xmath23 , and therefore larger @xmath34",
    ", one has a higher deuterium abundance if the baryon density is fixed . to lower the deuterium abundance to required levels one has to increase the baryon density .",
    "however , a larger baryon density ( keeping @xmath23 fixed ) will lead to a larger helium fraction . hence below a certain value of @xmath23 ( which depends on the constraints on the abundances )",
    "it is not possible to simultaneously obtain the correct amounts of deuterium and helium .",
    "this is also the reason why the allowed contour in the lower panel of figure [ final ] does not appear to close .",
    "one of parameters in cosmology on which we have little handle is the neutrino asymmetry , i.e. , the excess of neutrinos over anti - neutrinos or vice versa .",
    "this excess or deficit can be quantified by the neutrino chemical potential , @xmath65 , which enters into the fermi - dirac distribution function , given by @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "the chemical potential of anti - neutrinos is @xmath67 .",
    "the ratio @xmath68 is an invariant , as long as there are no entropy - changing processes which involve neutrinos .",
    "there are no compelling experimental or theoretical reasons to expect the neutrino ( lepton ) asymmetry ( @xmath69 ) to be orders of magnitude different from the baryon asymmetry .",
    "in fact , one might very well argue that it would only be natural for the baryon and lepton asymmetries to be comparable if they were formed by the same processes .",
    "however , we have no concrete experimental hints to back up our theoretical prejudice . moreover , in our framework",
    ", the value of @xmath68 is virtually unconstrained ( but for bbn ) since the standard cosmological bounds @xcite do not apply . note that in order to probe @xmath70 regime , one would require experiments which are capable of measuring neutrino energies down to @xmath71 ev .",
    "as we shall shortly see , bbn even without the assumption of standard gravity provides us with constraints on the value of the electron neutrino chemical potential in the @xmath72 regime .",
    "changing the neutrino chemical potential affects the neutrino number density . in standard",
    "bbn , a change in the neutrino number density affects the expansion rate and hence the abundances .",
    "clearly , this effect is non - existent in our study .",
    "the electron neutrino chemical potential also affects the @xmath73 reaction rates .",
    "this is the effect we shall be concerned with in this section . from here",
    "on , @xmath68 will implicitly refer to the electron neutrino chemical potential .",
    "detailed calculations of the effect of non - negligible @xmath68 ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) on bbn have been performed @xcite .",
    "the salient points are ( 1 ) the equilibrium value of n / p is modified by a factor of @xmath75 from that when @xmath76 , ( 2 ) the neutrino decoupling and n - p freeze - out temperatures are changed .",
    "the first point clearly implies the constraint , @xmath77 , if a helium-4 mass fraction of 24% is to be synthesized . in figure [ phinue ]",
    "we plot the allowed contours in @xmath23  @xmath22 plane .",
    "the contours are labelled by the value of @xmath68 .",
    "we have restricted @xmath56 to being 24.4% . allowing for our previously adopted range in @xmath56 will not change the result much as is apparent from the fact that the allowed contours in figure [ final ] are practically 1-dimensional .",
    "we note that if @xmath23 is set equal to 2 , then we are back to standard cosmology ; figure [ phinue ] then provides us with the constraint on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom ( @xmath78 ) @xcite .",
    "the principal feature in figure [ phinue ] is the trend of the required value of @xmath22 being larger for larger @xmath68 . at larger @xmath68 , the equilibrium value of n / p is smaller , and hence to compensate for that @xmath49 must be smaller or @xmath22 larger . for @xmath79 no solutions",
    "were found , which owes to the fact that at the small values of @xmath22 required to produce the right helium-4 , @xmath49 gets so large that one can not synthesize acceptable amounts of @xmath80 .",
    "we have shown that the viable ( satisfying bbn abundance constraints ) expansion histories can be well approximated by the range of allowed values of @xmath23 , for a fixed value of @xmath68 . lets concentrate on the more `` natural '' @xmath81 ( equivalent to @xmath76 ) case .",
    "given the allowed range of @xmath23 one can generate the allowed range of expansion rates at any temperature from about an mev to 50  kev by using h(t)=h_c(t / t_c)^. we have plotted the history of these viable non - standard universes in figure [ hvsa ] .",
    "the most interesting result of our study is that there is a range of expansion histories that are compatible with the observed light - element abundances .",
    "there is therefore room for substantial deviation from the standard cosmological model at early times , while remaining consistent with empirical evidence . on the other hand",
    ", it is encouraging to note that our allowed region ( essentially one - dimensional ) is only a small volume of the entire parameter space . in this sense",
