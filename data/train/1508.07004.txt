    "it is not possible to turn off h@xmath0co gas - phase formation and destruction pathways in the model while leaving reactions on the grains because of the close coupling between h@xmath0co gas - phase chemistry and the production of many other chemical species .",

    "the gas - phase only model yields a very centrally peaked column density profile ; the column density drops by more than an order of magnitude inside 100 au .",
    "in contrast , the grain - surface only model column density is almost flat out to 400 au followed by a slow decline . in the gas and grain - surface formation model , gas - phase formation is visible in the inner disk , with a sharp central peak , but outside the co snowline at @xmath380 au there is a rise in column density due to grain - surface formation . as expected , gas - phase formation regulates the h@xmath0co abundance in the hot and dense inner disk , while the inclusion of grain - surface reactions increases abundances outside the co snow line , where co has condensed out onto grains and is available for h@xmath0co formation .",
    "in addition to radial differentiation , the model results show that there is vertical structure in the h@xmath0co abundances ( top panels of fig .",
    "[ abund ] ) .",
    "grain - surface formation of h@xmath0co mainly enriches the disk in h@xmath0co gas in a banded layer where z / r is @xmath30.25 .",
    "this can be explained as a chemical balancing act , where the grain - surface formation and desorption of h@xmath0co is most efficient at the co  snow - surface \" in the presence of x - rays ( or other ionizing radiation ) .",
    "the grain - surface reactions to form h@xmath0co and ch@xmath1oh in @xcite rely on atomic hydrogen additions , where h formation is almost entirely driven by the ionization of h@xmath0 by x - rays from the cool central star . above this snow - surface layer co",
    "is not frozen out in high concentrations , and below this layer the disk becomes optically thick to x - rays , making the grain - surface chemistry inefficient .    to explore the robustness of these results to the chemical model inputs that have not been directly measured , we ran two additional models with a reduced cosmic ray ionization rate of @xmath45 s@xmath6 and a reduced reactive desorption efficiency of 1% , respectively . a reduced cosmic ray ionization rate ,",
    "as might be present in a disk with a \" t - tauriosphere  generated by stellar winds @xcite , reduces the total amount of grain surface h@xmath46co production , particularly in the mid - plane where other forms of radiation are not able to penetrate .",
    "reactive desorption similarly affects mainly midplane abundances , where it is the main ice desorption pathway ; at higher disk layers uv photodesorption is a more important desorption mechanism . compared to the standard chemical model above , the models with reduced cosmic ray ionization or reactive desorption result in a substantial ( order of magnitude ) reduction in h@xmath0co gas in the disk midplane .",
    "these abundance reductions in the midplane have no significant effect on the emission profile , however , as most of the emission comes from the relatively unaffected z / r @xmath30.25 surface rather than the midplane .",

    "a stellar mass of 0.7 m@xmath47 ( to determine line broadening ) , inclination of 34@xmath5 , and distance of 145 pc were assumed for the radiative transfer @xcite .",

    "the model abundances were uniformly scaled such that the peak integrated flux of the model and the observations match ( middle and bottom panels of fig . [ sim ] ) .",
    "the model over - predictions are not surprising , since h@xmath0co and ch@xmath1oh are at the maximum extent of the complexity considered in the reaction network , and thus there are limited reaction pathways away from these species . additionally , as the destruction products of h@xmath0co and ch@xmath1oh have a limited chemistry and are not able to form more complex species , h@xmath0co or ch@xmath1oh re - creation events are likely .",
    "observations have also shown that co abundances in disks may be depleted and time evolving , leading to possible over - prediction of molecules forming from co in the model @xcite .",
    "the three models exhibit very different emission profiles .",
    "the gas - phase only model yields compact centrally peaked emission . both models including grain - surface reactions have substantial h@xmath0co emission out to several hundred au .",
    "when comparing observed and simulated radial profiles , it is clear that the gas - phase model severely underpredicts emission in the outer disk .",
    "by contrast , grain - surface formation alone overpredicts emission outside 100 au .",
    "the gas and grain - surface chemistry model is most similar to the observations , but still overpredicts the relative amount of h@xmath0co emission between 150 and 300 au compared to the emission from the disk center .",
    "the presented alma observations show that the h@xmath0co emission around dm tau is fairly extended , consistent in radial extent with the observations of @xcite .",
    "in contrast to their detected ring shape , we find that h@xmath0co is centrally peaked .",
    "the detection of h@xmath0co emission from the inner disk in this data set and its absence in @xcite can be ascribed both to a combination of higher sensitivity and better uv coverage in the alma data , enabling us to recover weaker emission , and the fact that the two transitions have different excitation properties . in particular , the h@xmath0co transition analyzed in this work ( 5@xmath7 - 4@xmath8 ) has a significantly higher excitation energy than the 3@xmath48 - 2@xmath49 transition detected by @xcite ( e@xmath50 = 62.45 vs 32.06 k ) , and thus the previously noted h@xmath0co ring may be partially due to excitation effects . supporting this hypothesis ,",
    "lime simulations of our gas and grain model for the 3@xmath48 - 2@xmath49 transition show a substantially reduced inner disk component ( not shown ) compared to the 5@xmath7 - 4@xmath8 transition .",
    "the emission profile we observe in the outer disk of dm tau ( i.e. outside the co snow line ) can be explained well by grain - surface formation and desorption of h@xmath0co . however",
    "an explanation that accounts for the centrally peaked emission line profile also demands a contribution from gas - phase reactions .",
    "the proposed scenario where both gas and grain - surface chemistry contribute significantly to the disk h@xmath0co emission is confirmed by chemical modeling .",
    "the model results also demonstrate that the relative gas and grain - surface chemistry contributions to the observed h@xmath0co gas are highly dependent on disk radius .",
    "based on alma observations and detailed chemical modeling , we have shown that there are both gas - phase and grain - surface contributions to the observed h@xmath0co gas in dm tau .",
    "this is the first evidence of gas - phase formation of h@xmath0co toward a protoplanetary disk , and implies that h@xmath0co can not be used as a simple tracer of grain - surface chemistry without constraining the relative contributions of each formation route .",
    "the exact morphology of the h@xmath0co emission will depend sensitively on the ratio of these contributions , but will be difficult to recover from observations due to excitation degeneracies ( as demonstrated in the @xcite observations ) and the currently unknown vertical abundance structure .",
    "additional alma observations of multiple h@xmath0co transitions could be used to provide constraints on excitation conditions , and therefore the vertical h@xmath0co structure in a disk .",
    "such observations would also provide important constraints on ice desorption from grain - surfaces and thus how well ice and gas abundances are coupled in disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we have conclusively shown that some fraction of the h@xmath0co around dm tau must originate from hydrogenation of co on grain - surfaces .",
    "we therefore expect the next hydrogenation product of h@xmath0co , methanol ( ch@xmath1oh ) , to be present as well @xcite .",
    "although it has yet to be detected toward a protoplanetary disk , searching for both ch@xmath1oh and the complex products of its photochemistry ( e.g * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
