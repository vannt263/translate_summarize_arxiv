    "the resultant state is shown to exhibit non - zero amplitude and admits certain non - classical properties such as phase squeezing and sub - poissonian statistics .",
    "such an intermediate state can be experimentally realized by the passage of two - level atoms , which are kept in the excited state , through a cavity that encloses an @xmath7-photon medium @xcite .",
    "the photon added coherent state can also be generated through the parametric down conversion process @xcite .",

    "the single - photon addition to the coherent field using a ` non - degenerate parametric down - converter ' has also been demonstrated recently @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the experimental evidences as well as theoretical arguments that the photon addition and subtraction can be used as probes to generate various non - classical states .",
    "the photon addition and subtraction are important tools to test certain fundamental quantum phenomena .",
