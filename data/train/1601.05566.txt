    "laplace - beltrami operator is a natural second order elliptic operator on a riemannian manifold defined as div @xmath6 grad .",
    "it is well known that on a closed manifold , this operator has discrete positive eigenvalues with finite multiplicities [ 4].two riemannian manifolds are isospectral if their laplace - beltrami operator have the same spectrum , considering multiplicities . a fundamental question by mark kac asks whether it is possible to find two nonisometric isospectral manifolds . the first answer to this question was provided by milnor s 16 dimensional tori that is a geometric realization of self - dual lattices with the same theta functions @xcite .",
    "naturally , lattices appear in the theory of crystallography as symmetries of a crystal lattice .",
    "we mean by a crystal lattice , a periodic harmonic realization of a commutative covering space of a finite graph . in the nature ,",
    "the interatomic forces lead to oscillations of crystal s atoms around their equilibrium positions .",
    "these oscillations are called crystal lattice vibrations .",
    "physicists usually decompose the system of oscillations into independent simple harmonic oscillators , and calculate the distribution of vibration frequencies @xcite .",
    "this method is the same as the theory of fourier series for a vibrated chord .",
    "acoustic phase velocities are the phase velocity of elastic waves in the uniform elastic body corresponding to the crystal lattice . in this article",
    "we consider the integration of acoustic phase velocity in the direction of closed geodesics of the lattice character group and we find the algebraic formalism of hearing the eigenvalues of laplacian ( or equivalently the frequencies ) on the torus @xmath5 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 a review of the notion of a crystal lattice and its realization",
    "is presented .",

    "in fact , the elements @xmath56 are the same as the angular frequencies . using the index @xmath57 for an operator",
