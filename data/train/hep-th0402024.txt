    "since the demonstration that gravity can be localised on a @xmath0-dimensional submanifold of a higher dimensional bulk spacetime  @xcite , there has been a revival of interest in the old idea  @xcite that rather than taking the higher dimensional spacetime to be a ( possibly warped ) product of a compact internal space with a four - dimensional spacetime one should instead regard our spacetime as a 3-brane embedded , or more speculatively immersed ( i.e having self - intersections ) , in a bulk spacetime . once this idea has been accepted it becomes natural to ask whether such branes can collide , as in the ekpyrotic scenario  @xcite , or oscillate cyclically  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that models of this kind entirely change the context in which old problems in cosmology , such as the singularity theorems , the possibility of topology change , the birth of the universe from nothing etc should be discussed .",
    "in particular the idea that it is sufficient to consider our universe as a purely self - contained four - dimensional lorentzian spacetime whose evolution can be discussed without reference to the bulk becomes untenable .",
    "moreover in violent processes , such as brane collisions , one expects the usual clear - cut distinction between brane and bulk to break down .",
    "we have also known for many years  @xcite that if changes of topology are involved , spacetime can not be causal and time orientable and admit an everywhere smooth non - singular lorentzian metric .",
    "so far , the main response to this obstacle has either been to adopt singular 4-dimensional lorentzian metrics , or to appeal to quantum processes mediated by gravitational instantons , that have riemannian to denote @xmath1 , @xmath2 , equipped with a flat metric of signature @xmath3 .",
    "thus @xmath4 is @xmath5-dimensional euclidean space . ]",
    "one view point on that latter approach is to consider spacetimes admitting a change of signature , the instanton being regarded as a region of spacetime where the spacetime signature is @xmath6 .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect that a successful theory of brane collisions should throw much needed light on these , at present rather obscure , issues .    modelling the collision of branes using the full equations of motion of the bulk spacetime , even supposing a classical or semi - classical approximation to be valid , is technically an extremely challenging task and so far comparatively small progress has been made , and much of it in the adiabatic approximation in which the collision process is supposed to be slow .",
    "one then considers a rather conventional four - dimensional cosmology of the friedman - lemaitre type with additional scalar fields representing the separation of the two colliding branes .",
    "the associated scalar fields are very similar to , and in some cases may be identified with , the tachyon fields encountered in open string theory . in these approaches gravity is fully taken into account , but not the loss of distinction between brane and bulk , nor are issues of singularities , topology and signature change fully faced up to .",
    "signature changes in the randall - sundrum braneworld context have been discussed in @xcite .    in this note",
    "we wish to explore a different , and hopefully complementary approximation which , while gravity is ignored , provides a perfectly smooth and non - singular account of both topology and signature change .",
    "a further merit of our description is that it is extremely simple .",
    "the basic starting point is the dirac - born - infeld action for a d - brane , which has previously proved so effective in tackling global questions of this kind in string / m - theory .",
    "in what follows we shall set to zero the born - infeld world volume gauge field and tachyon field and consider only as an action functional the total area or volume of the brane - t_p a(_p+1 ) = -t_p _ _ p+1 d^p+1 u^1 u^2  u^p+1 , [ action ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 are world volume coordinates of the @xmath9-brane @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 gives an immersion of @xmath13 into an @xmath14-dimensional spacetime with metric @xmath15 .",
    "the constant @xmath16 is the brane - tension and its value will play no role in what follows",
    ". some very interesting solutions of the equation of motion including born - infeld field were obtained in refs .",
    "these solutions exhibit signature change .",
    "the result we are about to describe shows that the born - infeld field is not necessary for signature change . in the case when the tachyon and born - infeld field are non - vanishing , there is a question of which metric , the open string metric or induced metric  @xcite undergoes signature change . some ideas about signature change at finite temperature in external electromagnetic field for open strings may be found in  @xcite . in the present case , there is only one metric and this question does not arise for us .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations are easily derived , _ a ( h^ab_b x^ ) - ^ _ h^ab _ a x^_b x^ = 0 , [ e - l : eom ] where @xmath17 is the inverse of @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the christoffel symbol with respect to @xmath15 . geometrically the variational equation amount to the statement that the mean curvature vector , i.e. , the vector obtained by taking the trace of the @xmath20 second fundamental forms associated with the co - dimension @xmath21 immersion , vanishes . in what follows",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the case of a hypersurface for which @xmath22 and the physical case is thus @xmath23 .",
    "if spacelike , and immersed in a riemannian space , hypersurfaces of this type are often called minimal , even though in general they will only be saddle points of the area or volume functional .",
    "it makes no sense to speak of ` maximal ' submanifolds of a riemannian manifold because almost all variations will be area increasing . hypersurfaces which are true local minima are often referred to as ` stable ' .",
    "by contrast a spacelike hypersurface in a lorentzian manifold is said to be maximal .",
    "this is because almost all variations of a spacelike hypersurface of a lorentzian spacetime will decrease its volume .",
    "maximal hypersurfaces have been extensively studied in the mathematical and general relativity literature .",
    "the case we are interested in is the timelike case which have , by comparison , hitherto been rather neglected .",
    "such timelike hypersuraces may also be called maximal .",
    "the action ( [ action ] ) has a great deal of gauge - invariance ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we fix it by adopting what is sometimes inaccurately called ` static ' gauge .",
    "a better term is monge gauge  @xcite .",
    "it amounts to using a height function as the basic variable .",
    "one could choose the height coordinate to be spacelike or timelike , independently of whether the hypersurface is timelike or spacelike .",
    "we shall choose a _ timelike height function _",
    "@xmath25 to specify our hypersurface , with @xmath26 , @xmath27 . for most cases in this note",
    ", @xmath15 is taken as the minkowski metric @xmath28 and only the first term of eq .",
    "( [ e - l : eom ] ) is relevant .    _",
    "if the hypersurface is spacelike or timelike , the equation of motion is the same _ , it is \\ { 1- ^cd ( _ c t ) _ d t } ^ab_a_b t + ^ac^bd(_a t ) ( _ b t ) _ c _ d t = 0 .",
    "[ eom ]    it is perhaps worth re - emphasising that eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) is valid for both spacelike or timelike hypersurfaces and it remains well defined if the signature of the metric @xmath29 induced on the hypersurface changes sign , that is if @xmath30 passes through unity .",
    "this strongly indicates that eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) presents no obstacle to signature change , a fact we shall confirm in detail shortly . although eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) has been derived from the dirac - born - infeld action ( [ action ] ) , we have eliminated square roots , which is essential to allow a smooth signature change .",
    "to emphasise this point , we shall refer to eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) as the ( lorentzian ) laplace - young equation since it is the lorentzian analogue of the laplace - young equation which arises in the study of soap films and other areas of condensed matter physics ",
    "see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it may be regarded as a non - linear equation for @xmath31 with @xmath32 independent variables which may change from hyperbolic to elliptic , when the matrix _ ab \\ { 1- ^cd(_c t ) _ d t } + ( _ a t ) _ b t changes signature .",
    "this occurs precisely when ^cd ( _ c t ) _ d t = 1 .",
    "thus strictly speaking , even in the lorentzian part of the world volume , one can not speak of a cauchy problem for the evolution .",
    "it is this feature of the equation which permits signature and topology change .",
    "one strategy for obtaining solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) is to take a known explicit solution @xmath33 of the standard minimal surface equation for a spacelike minimal surface in flat euclidean space and wick rotate , that is analytically continue it in such a way that @xmath34 .",
    "for our first example we start with enneper s surface  @xcite which is given by x= 3 + 3 ^2 -^3 , y= 3 + 3 ^2 -^3 , z=3 ^2 - 3 ^2 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are world volume coordinates in conformal gauge .",
    "the metric induced on the surface is ds ^2 = 9 ( 1 + ^2 + ^2 ) ^2 ( d ^2 + d ^2 ) .",
    "the wick rotation consists of setting @xmath37 , @xmath38 with @xmath39 a real spacelike coordinate and @xmath40 a real timelike coordinate .",
    "this results in @xmath41 with @xmath42 real and relabelling @xmath43 as @xmath44 we get x= ( 3 - 3 ^2 -^2 ) , y=3 ^2 + 3 ^2 , t= ( 3 + 3 ^2 + ^2 ) .",
    "the induced metric is ds^2 = 9(1 + ^2 -^2 ) ^2 ( d ^2 -d^2 ) . a trivial extension to the @xmath45-dimensional case",
    "is obtained by adding @xmath46 to the above metric .",
    "the surface is time symmetric in the sense that @xmath47 takes @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath49 and @xmath40 run over @xmath50 we have an everywhere lorentzian metric except on the null curves @xmath51 at which the conformal factor vanishes .",
    "a simple calculation reveals that the @xmath52 jacobian matrix @xmath53 has rank 2 except on the two null curves .",
    "this implies that we have a smooth immersion or embedding away from the two null curves .",
    "the formula for @xmath54 as a function of @xmath55 at fixed @xmath40 , is a cubic , anti - symmetric in @xmath55 which always passes through @xmath56 at @xmath57 . for @xmath58",
    "the cubic has two other roots at @xmath59 .",
    "thus in this interval , @xmath55 is not a single valued function of @xmath54 . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the three roots coalesce at the beginning of the null curves @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and there after @xmath55 is a single valued function of @xmath54 . in fact eliminating @xmath55 we find x= ( 3 - 2 ^ 2- ) .",
    "the interpretation is that , neglecting the coordinates @xmath63 we have an infinitely long piece of string , symmetric about the @xmath44 axis which intersects itself on the @xmath44 axis at @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "this loop tightens up and shortens forming a kink which then moves outward along the null curve at the speed of light as illustrated in figure  [ fig : ennerper ] .",
    "the world sheet is a smooth immersion , rather than an embedding except precisely on the kink .",
    "this describes a self - intersecting braneworld that changes its spatial topology from a loop to a cusp and then a kink .",
    "= 8.0 cm    [ fig : ennerper ]      further examples of smoothly intersecting branes may be obtained by adapting and extending the work of  @xcite .",
    "he constructs riemannian minimal @xmath67-dimensional submanifolds of @xmath68 invariant under @xmath69 and shows that generically they intersect on @xmath70 .",
    "geometrically the submanifolds are warped product of the form @xmath71 .",
    "these would of course provide static intersecting @xmath9-branes with @xmath72 .",
    "one may generalise his set up slightly by considering @xmath67-dimensional minimal submanifolds of @xmath73 invariant under @xmath74 .",
    "one sets x^= ( x(t ) * n*_m , y(t ) * n*_n ) , where @xmath75 is a unit vector in @xmath76 defining a unit @xmath77 and @xmath78 is a unit spacelike vector in @xmath79 defining a de sitter space @xmath80 of unit radius .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath81 and @xmath82 may be obtained by substituting in the dirac - born - infeld action ( [ action ] ) to get a lagrangian l= x^m-1 y ^n-1 .",
    "[ lagrange ] some calculations lead to the equation - x y = m+n-2 2 ( y x - x y ) ( x ^2 + y ^2 ) .    if @xmath83 this coincides with the equation obtained in  @xcite . at this stage",
    "we still have the freedom to choose the parameter @xmath42 .",
    "one choice ( adopted in  @xcite ) is to use arc length , i.e. set ^2 + y ^2 = 1 .",
    "[ condition ] if @xmath83 , the analysis proceeds exactly as in  @xcite .",
    "a glance at figures ( a ) and ( b ) in  @xcite reveals the existence of multiply intersecting solutions ( for which @xmath84 and for which @xmath54 and @xmath44 never vanish ) of topology @xmath85 and multiply intersecting solutions for which @xmath54 vanishes at one end point , of topology @xmath86 .",
    "despite the self - intersections , the intrinsic geometry on the @xmath9-brane is everywhere smooth and the metric everywhere lorentzian .",
    "this is related to the fact that we adopted the gauge condition ( [ condition ] ) which forbids signature change .",
    "it is interesting to speculate about what happens near the self - intersection surface .",
    "as far as the world volume theory is concerned this is a smooth timelike hypersurface , a sort of domain wall at which four spacetime regions meet .",
    "one question is whether one can pass from one sheet to another",
    ". one might also wonder whether charges which would otherwise be conserved can leak from one sheet to another .",
    "we first recapitulate the two - dimensional world sheet case .",
    "perhaps the most familiar minimal surface is the catenoid .",
    "this takes the form = z. wick - rotating gives the world sheet of a collapsing circular loop of string = t. this corresponds to the embedding x= , y= , t= , with induced metric ds^2 = ^2 (  d ^2 -d ^2 ) .",
    "[ metric : cyclic ] the embedding is singular at @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "it is well known that the catenoid is locally isometric to the helicoid .",
    "this corresponds to the spinning string solution for which x= , y= , t= , with induced metric ds^2= ^2 ( d ^2 - d ^2 ) .",
    "the ends of the string are at @xmath89 which move on a lightlike helix .",
    "the spinning solution and the collapsing circular loop are related by the interchange of @xmath39 and @xmath40 . a similar discrete symmetry links the catenoid and helicoids . in that case",
    ", the discrete symmetry is contained in a more general @xmath90 symmetry discovered in the case of usual minimal surfaces by bonnet  @xcite which allows one to construct a one parameter family of minimal , locally isometric , embeddings connecting the catenoid and the helicoid .",
    "the case of minimal lorentzian surfaces is slightly different .",
    "there is now a continuous @xmath91 symmetry , but it does not contain the discrete interchange of @xmath55 and @xmath40 . explicitly the following one - parameter family of embeddings is both minimal and isometric x= - , y= + , t= + , where @xmath92 denotes the @xmath91 parameter .",
    "the induced metric becomes the same as  ( [ metric : cyclic ] ) , and the embedding is singular at @xmath93 , @xmath88 irrespective of the value of @xmath92 .",
    "clearly @xmath94 is the collapsing circular loop and @xmath95 gives a one - dimensional null helix x=(+ ) , y= ( + ) , t=+ .    from the point of view of string theory ,",
    "this symmetry is related to t - duality .",
    "this works as follows .",
    "consider first the case of a world sheet which has positive definite signature @xcite .",
    "we introduce isothermal coordinates @xmath96 , in which the induced metric is conformally flat ds^2 = ^2 dz d |z .",
    "the equation of motion is ^2",
    "x^a=0 ^2 z |z x^a=0 .",
    "thus we may take @xmath97 to be the real part of some holomorphic function .",
    "if ^a = x^a z = ( x^a x^1 - i x^a x^2 ) , then the conformal gauge condition is ^a ^a=0 .",
    "[ nullcond ] thus weirstrass s procedure works as follows : we obtain a holomorphic solution of ( [ nullcond ] ) and set x^a = ^a(z ) dz .",
    "now the bonnet rotation ^a(z ) e^i ^a(z ) with the angle @xmath98 constant , leaves ( [ nullcond ] ) unchanged and preserves holomorphicity .",
    "however , it changes the embedding but not the induced metric , since @xmath99 is unchanged .",
    "now @xmath100 , and a bonnet rotation rotates @xmath101 into @xmath102 .",
    "this is essentially t - duality as understood by string theorists since it typically rotates dirichlet into neumann boundary conditions .    for lorentzian world sheets a similar procedure will work but the bonnet rotation becomes a bonnet boost .",
    "formally , at least , the easiest way to see this is to replace the complex numbers by the ` double ' or ` para - complex ' numbers .",
    "that is one sets z= x^1+e x^2,|z= x^1-e x^2 , e^2 = 1 .",
    "spinning @xmath9-brane solutions for @xmath103 have been constructed which spin in @xmath9 orthogonal @xmath104-planes  @xcite .",

    "a^2 f^2_a |__p+1 = 1 .",
    "it is a striking fact that as in the case of a spinning string , the induced metric is _ static _ : ds^2 = -dt^2 ( 1- _ a ^2_a f^2_a ) + _ a ( d f_a ) ^2 . in other words , despite the fact that the @xmath9-brane is rotating , an observer of the world volume would not be aware of any velocity dependent corioli effects .",
    "the main signature of rotation on the world volume would be a non - trivial newtonian potential giving rise to fictitious centrifugal forces coming from the metric component @xmath107 .",
    "the catenoid may easily be generalised to @xmath108-dimensions .",
    "the wick rotation gives an @xmath109 invariant @xmath9-brane whose induced metric is of @xmath110 friedmann - lemaitre form .",
    "this has been discussed previously  @xcite . as in the case of @xmath111",
    "we obtain a cyclic spacetime which passes through a spacetime singularity of big bang or big crunch type . using the results of  @xcite",
    "one may avoid the singularity .",
    "one has an embedding into @xmath112 x^= ( t , r(t ) ( t ) * n * ( u^a ) , r(t ) ( t ) * n*(u^a ) ) [ hermann ] , where @xmath113 is a minimal @xmath9-surface in a unit @xmath114 .",

    "thus for example , if @xmath118 and @xmath119 one could choose an equatorial @xmath120 in @xmath121 to get a 3-brane moving in 11 spacetime dimensions .",

    "in order for inhabitants on the brane to understand the situation , they need to develop quantum gravity theory in 4-dimensions . on the other hand , from the bulk view point ,",
    "the brane is everywhere , even at the points corresponding to the singularity , smooth .",
    "it can be simply described by embedding equation .",
    "this observation suggests an possible way of resolving spacetime singularities in the braneworld context .",
    "this also conforms to the spirit of holographic principle or bulk - boundary correspondence , in the sense that quantum theory on a brane could be understood in terms of bulk classical theory . in order to make spacetime metric",
    "real , the euclidean approach needs the existence of a totally geodesic spacelike hypersurface .",
    "this is one of great limitations of the uses of the euclidean approach . in the present model , the euclidean region of a braneworld",
    "is connected with lorentzian region at spacelike surfaces which are not totally geodesic surface but correspond to a singularity",
