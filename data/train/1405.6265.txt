    "in the recent years considerable attention @xcite has been given to the characterization and analysis of the solutions to the non homogeneous linear equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a real - valued random vector with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is a sequence of i.i.d .",

    "equation has applications in a wide variety of fields , including the analysis of divide and conquer algorithms @xcite , e.g. quicksort @xcite ; the analysis of the pagerank algorithm @xcite ; and kinetic gas theory @xcite .",
    "our work in @xcite shows that the so - called endogenous solution , as termed in @xcite , of , under the natural main root condition @xmath18 = 1 $ ] with positive derivative @xmath19 < \\infty$ ] for some @xmath20 , has the power tail behavior , @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "the main tool used in deriving this result was a generalization of goldie s implicit renewal theorem @xcite to weighted branching trees .",
    "motivated by a different set of applications , we study in this paper the maximum recursion on trees given by @xmath23 where @xmath13 is a random vector with @xmath14 , nonnegative weights @xmath5 , and @xmath15 , and @xmath24 is a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables independent of @xmath13 having the same distribution as @xmath0 .",
    "here and throughout the paper we use @xmath25 and @xmath26 to denote the maximum and the minimum , respectively , of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we point out that by taking the logarithm in when @xmath29 a.s . , we obtain the additive equivalent @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and the @xmath34 are i.i.d .",
    "copies of @xmath35 , independent of @xmath36 .",
    "note that for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , reduces to the classical lindley s equation , satisfied by the reflected random walk ; and when @xmath39 , the recursion corresponds to a random walk reflected on a random barrier .",
    "in general , the preceding additive equation has been studied in the literature of branching random walks since , when @xmath38 , @xmath35 represents the range of the branching random walk ( see @xcite ,  4.2 ) .",
    "recursion was termed  high - order lindley equation \" and studied in the context of queues with synchronization in @xcite . unlike the classical lindley equation , it was shown in @xcite that can have multiple solutions .",
    "a more complete analysis of the existence and the characterization of the entire family of solutions was carried out in @xcite ( e.g. , see theorem 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , it can be shown that the study of arises in the context of today s massively parallel computing .",
    "more specifically , consider a job that is split into smaller pieces which are sent randomly to different processors , and these pieces need to communicate , i.e. , need to be synchronized , in order to complete their processing . in the limiting regime as the number of processors goes to infinity , a similar reasoning as in @xcite can be used to show that represents the delay for job completion in this massively parallel system .",
    "in addition to these applications , a better understanding of immediately leads to important insights to other max - plus branching recursions .",
    "more precisely , for the case of nonnegative weights , is a natural lower bound for many other recursions on trees @xcite , e.g. , for the same set of weights , elementary arguments show that @xmath17 in is stochastically larger than the solution @xmath0 in .    for all of the reasons described above , we study in this paper the tail behavior of the minimal / endogenous solution to the maximum recursion in ( or ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , equation can have multiple solutions .",
    "it is worth noting that the minimal / endogenous solution we study here is also central in characterizing all other solutions , as stated in theorem 1 of @xcite ( there @xmath40 is used to denote the minimal / endogenous solution ) .",
    "furthermore , we would like to point out that under iterations of the fixed - point equation ( or ) , the minimal / endogenous solution is the primary limiting value , unless one starts with very specific initial distributions ( see theorem 1(ii ) in @xcite ) ; we will discuss this in more detail in section [ s.maxrec ] .",
    "in addition , we emphasize that the tail characterization of the other ( non minimal solutions ) was given in @xcite , but the tail behavior of the minimal one was left open .",
    "our first main result , stated in theorem [ t.maximumrecursion ] , describes the tail behavior of the minimal / endogenous solution to the maximum recursion ( or ) . in this regard ,",
    "the application of the implicit renewal theorem on trees ( see theorem 3.4 @xcite ) , under the natural conditions @xmath41 = 1 $ ] and @xmath42 < \\infty$ ] for some @xmath20 , readily gives that @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "however , the main difficulty in establishing the power - law behavior lies in proving that @xmath45 . unlike in the linear case , it is not clear that this constant should be positive at all , since at first glance the expression which determines @xmath46 in theorem 3.4 of section [ s.maxrec ] , @xmath47,\\ ] ] appears just as likely to be negative .",
    "note also that a direct application of a ladder heights argument gives the positivity of the constant for the classical non - branching case ( @xmath37 ) , see theorem 5.2 in @xcite .",
    "however , for the branching case no ladder heights equivalent is available .",
    "hence , our first main contribution lies in a new sample - path construction showing that @xmath45 under no additional assumptions ( besides those needed for the application of theorem  3.4 in @xcite ) .",
    "observe that in the additive case of equation , our result yields the exponential asymptotics @xmath48 , which is the generalization of the well known cramr - lundberg approximation .",
    "the latter is widely used in insurance risk theory and queueing .    furthermore , as an immediate corollary one obtains the strict positivity of @xmath49 in the linear case with nonnegative @xmath13 . in this",
    "setting , the work in @xcite used a straightforward convexity argument to show that @xmath50 for @xmath51 , but the corresponding question for @xmath52 was left open .",
    "the strict positivity of @xmath49 for @xmath52 was recently resolved in @xcite as part of the more general real - valued case , but under additional assumptions that include @xmath53 < \\infty$ ] .",
    "note that in the additive equation , this extra moment assumption corresponds to the finiteness of @xmath54 exponential moments of the @xmath55 . since the new results on the maximum hold without such additional assumptions , theorem [ t.maximumrecursion ] fully completes the prior work for nonnegative @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , as already mentioned , the maximum is a natural lower bound for other max - plus recursions , and therefore this result can potentially be used to prove the power - tail asymptotics of the endogenous solutions to other recursions , e.g. , the discounted tree sums considered in @xcite .",
    "we now go back to the linear recursion with real - valued weights @xmath56 , which has recently been considered in @xcite ( see also @xcite for the multivariate case ) .",
    "the characterization of all the solutions of when @xmath57 is real - valued , @xmath58 and @xmath59 a.s . was given in @xcite .",
    "the work in @xcite establishes the implicit renewal theorem on trees for the real - valued case and shows that , under the usual conditions @xmath18 = 1 $ ] and @xmath60 < \\infty$ ] , the endogenous solution to has a power tail behavior of the form @xmath61 , @xmath62 . in that paper",
    "the strict positivity of @xmath49 in its full generality remained open .",
    "it was this open problem that motivated the work in @xcite , where it was shown , using complex analysis and analytical functions , that @xmath63 under the additional assumptions @xmath59 a.s .",
    ", @xmath64 < \\infty$ ] and @xmath65 < \\infty$ ] .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the problem of the strict positivity of @xmath49 for the general real - valued case using our result on the maximum equation ( with nonnegative weights @xmath5 ) , under no additional assumptions on the vector @xmath66 besides those needed for theorem 3.4 in @xcite .",
    "however , we do require that @xmath57 does not reduce to a constant given @xmath66 .",
    "our main set of arguments is based on lvy s symmetrization approach .",
    "we would like to mention that although the proof of theorem 4.1 in @xcite ( the part that establishes the positivity of @xmath49 for the case @xmath37 ) also relies on symmetrization , our proof is completely different . while in the one - dimensional case it was enough to center the weights around their median , in the branching case we need complete symmetry .",
    "more precisely , the proof consists in first showing the positivity of the constant for symmetric trees , and then extending it to the general case through a coupling argument ; see corollary  [ c.strictpositivity ] .",
    "in general , as previously stated , we expect that theorem  [ t.maximumrecursion ] for the maximum , coupled with the implicit renewal theorem on trees ( theorem  3.4 in @xcite ) , can be used to derive the exact power law asymptotics of the solutions to other branching recursions @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s.modeldescription ] includes a brief description of the weighted branching process .",
    "section  [ s.maxrec ] contains our first main result about the asymptotic behavior of the minimal / endogenous solution to the maximum recursion , including the strict positivity of @xmath46 .",
