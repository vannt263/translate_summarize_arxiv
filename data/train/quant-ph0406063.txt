    "quantum error - correcting codes  @xcite protect quantum information against noise .",
    "they play important roles in many areas of quantum information theory , but most critically , in the viability of a quantum computer .",
    "quantum error correction negates a quantum state s natural susceptibility to decohere , and thus provides the long - time coherence necessary to sustain quantum computation .",
    "shor  @xcite and steane  @xcite presented the first constructions of quantum error - correcting codes .",
    "these discoveries led to a formal connection between quantum codes and classical additive codes  @xcite , and consequently , the characterization of a general class of quantum error - correcting codes commonly referred to as stabilizer codes  @xcite .",
    "the idea behind quantum error correction is to encode quantum states into qudits in such a way that a small number of errors affecting the individual qudits can be detected and corrected to perfectly restore the original encoded state . in this article",
    "we investigate the integrity of a quantum error - correcting code when under the influence of errors affecting more qudits than what the code was originally designed to handle .",
    "we derive general formulae to calculate the probabilities of successful error detection or correction , when the errors are depolarizing , and we are given",
    "either ( i ) the location of the errors , ( ii ) the number of errors , or , ( iii ) the probability that a single qudit is in error .",
    "such formulae provide a means to compare codes of the same minimum distance .",
    "for the analysis of error detection we treat general quantum error - correcting codes constructed from qudits .",
    "this extends the results of ashikhmin _ et al _",
    "we then specialize to stabilizer codes for the case of error correction , where the dimension of the constituent qudit subsystems is a prime power .    when the constituent subsystems are qubits , we give explicit results for a variety of stabilizer codes encoding a single qubit .",
    "we find that , for the depolarizing channel under error detection , as the number of qubits increases we are generally able to construct better codes even when the minimum distance remains constant .",
    "however this is not so for error correction . in this case",
    "the unique five - qubit quantum hamming code outperforms all other codes of minimum distance three .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce quantum error - correcting codes , giving conditions for a code to have a specified minimum distance in terms of its weight enumerators .",
