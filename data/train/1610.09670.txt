    "the formation and evolution of planetesimals are essential steps in the classical core accretion model for the origin of planets @xcite .",

    "the crater - covered surfaces of asteroids , the moon , and mercury provide vivid supporting evidence for such an assumption .",
    "these collisions are generally preceded by close elastic encounters that excite the planetesimals eccentricities and induce orbit crossing .    through scattering and collisions ,",
    "planetesimals attain an equilibrium velocity dispersion , @xmath2 . in a gas - free environment ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath2 is a significant fraction of their characteristic surface escape speeds @xcite . at such a high speed",
    ", many collisions among super - kilometer - size planetesimals may lead to breakup rather than a merger @xcite .",
    "direct evidence of collisional fragmentation can be found in iron / stone meteorites .",
    "their parent bodies were differentiated prior to catastrophic collisions .",
    "the much more common chondritic meteorites may also be the collisional by - products of parent bodies that may have avoided differentiation because they formed after the radioactive @xmath3al isotopes have mostly decayed .",
    "the possibility of collisional fragmentation poses a potential barrier for planetesimal formation and growth . in attempts to explore pathways to bypass the kilometer - size coagulation barrier ,",
    "several scenarios have been proposed .",
    "grains and planetary building block materials may be trapped in regions with a local pressure maximum , where the flow is keplerian and the planetesimals @xmath2 is relatively small , to promote cohesive rather than disruptive collisions .",
    "one such a location is the snow line @xcite which , during the advanced stages of solar nebula evolution , may have been located close to or interior to the present - day asteroid belt @xcite .",
    "other growth hypotheses that have been proposed and analyzed so far include gravitational instability @xcite , streaming instability @xcite , and turbulent trapping @xcite .",
    "while most planetesimals may eventually be accreted by a few massive embryos to form either terrestrial planets or progenitor cores of gas giants @xcite , some relics are retained in the asteroid belt .",
    "the dynamics , structure , and composition of the asteroids carry important information on the chronology and dominant physical processes associated with planetesimal and planet formation .",
    "one particularly important clue is the asteroids size - frequency distribution ( sfd ) .",
    "conventional coagulation models predict a power - law spectrum @xcite that generally matches that of impactors thought to have produced the observed crater size distributions on the moon and on mercury .",
    "in contrast , the alternative collective mechanisms lead to a rapid emergence of preferentially large planetesimals .",
    "the observed sfd in the present - day main belt ( @xmath1 au ) is dominated by the midsize asteroids , with an apparent lack of small ( sub - kilometer - size ) and large ( moon - size ) bodies @xcite .",
    "based on the assumption that planetesimals formed through collective mechanisms @xcite with a minimal size around 100  km , @xcite reproduced the observed sfd slope .",
    "however , the rapid formation of relatively large planetesimals also implies that they are likely to have acquired similar quantities of radioactive @xmath3al isotopes , as those found in the most primitive calcium - aluminium - rich inclusions ( cais ) . under such conditions ,",
    "the heat released from nuclear fission would be adequate to melt and differentiate planetesimals with sizes larger than a few tens of kilometers @xcite . under the rapid formation scenario , first - generation large planetesimals are likely to be differentiated .",
    "cosmochemical analysis of iron meteorites @xcite suggests that there may indeed have been @xmath4 differentiated parent bodies that acquired their relatively large mass at sufficiently early time .",
    "however , the undifferentiated chondritic meteorites make up the predominant population of meteorites that struck the earth . since most meteorites originate from the asteroid belt , if a population of large planetesimals did emerge very early ( within a few hundred thousand years ) , they and their collisional fragments would have to be preferentially cleared out of the main belt region .    the empirical _ minimum mass solar nebula _ ( mmsn ) model @xcite and the conventional formation model for large asteroids and chondritic meteorites in the main belt are constructed based on the assumption that the mass distribution ( in both gas and refractory solids ) is continuous throughout the solar nebula @xcite",
    ". however , the total present - day mass of the asteroids , estimated from mars s orbit and the asteroids observed sfd , is @xmath5 earth masses @xcite .",
    "this apparent depression in the mass distribution , relative to the mmsn model , suggests that up to @xmath6 of the residual planetesimals total mass may have been lost from the main belt region . in the context of the `` grand - tack '' model ,",
    "@xcite put forward the possibility of inward - then - outward migration of jupiter and saturn , which may have migrated to the present - day location of the main belt prior to the disk depletion .",
    "as a consequence , asteroids in the main belt are severely depleted and repopulated during the phase of the gas giants instability .",
    "in this work we propose an alternative scenario to account for the observed sfd and the mass deficit in the main asteroid belt , based on the classical planetesimal coagulation ( rather than the collective formation ) model .",
    "we assume that coagulation and fragmentation of asteroids occurred within 2  myr ( which is comparable to the radiogenic age of the chondritic meteorites ) when the energy release rate from the decay of @xmath3al has largely diminished .",
    "we also assume that these processes lead to a continuous sfd ranging from dust to lunar - size protoplanetary embryos @xcite with a total mass several times that of the earth .    in order to reproduce the observed sfd and the present - day low surface density in the main belt region , we propose that the small and large planetesimals were cleared by @xmath7 secular resonance ( sr ) that swept through the region during the local clearing and global depletion of the solar nebula ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we suggest that this process occurred after the formation of jupiter and on a time scale of @xmath8  myr , comparable to the observed depletion time scale of protostellar disks @xcite and the radiogenic age difference between the cais and chondrules .",
    "the sweeping secular resonances ( ssrs ) excite the eccentricities of all planetesimals along their path .",
    "the eccentricities of the small ( sub - kilometer - size ) rocky bodies and large ( moon - size ) embryos are effectively damped by the hydrodynamic drag and planet - disk tidal interaction .",
    "consequently , these planetesimals undergo orbital decay synchronously with the inward sweeping of the @xmath9 sr @xcite . as an extention of these previous investigations ,",
    "we show that some intermediate - size planetesimals are retained in the main belt because their eccentricity damping and orbital decay are less effective .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we briefly recapitulate the basic physical effects of the sweeping srs , and we describe our numerical method and initial conditions in  3 . in ",
    "4 we compute the orbital evolution for planetesimals with a range of sizes .",
    "based on these results , we reconstruct the asteroids sfd and the mass depletion rate of the asteroid belt under the combined effects of ssrs and eccentricity damping .",
    "we compare our results with observations and discuss the implications in  5 .",
    "we briefly recapitulate the physical concept of the dynamical shake - up model , which was proposed in the context of terrestrial planet formation by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the following assumptions that ( i ) the initial growth of planetesimals of an unperturbed gaseous solar nebula was limited by their isolation mass @xmath10 . in an mmsn , @xmath11 within a few astronomical units , but beyond the snow line embryos may acquire super - earth masses @xcite .",
    "( ii ) relatively massive ( @xmath12 ) embryos can efficiently accrete gas @xcite and evolve into jupiter and saturn within @xmath13myr . ( iii ) gas in the solar nebula was depleted over a characteristic time scale ( @xmath8myr ) , comparable to that observed in disks around t  tauri stars @xcite .",
    "in addition , we assume that gravitational interaction between the emerging gas giants and nearby embryos and planetesimals induced scattering and giant impacts during their formation @xcite .",
    "these close encounters lead not only to orbit crossing @xcite and compositional mixing of residual planetesimals @xcite , but also to eccentricity excitation of the emerging planets . with a finite eccentricity ,",
    "jupiter and saturn exert a secular perturbation on the residual planetesimals , causing their eccentricities to modulate and their longitudes of periastron to precess @xcite .",
    "this perturbation is particularly strong near the gas giants low - order mean motion resonances ( mmrs ) . due to the self - gravity of the nebula , jupiter s and saturn s orbits also precess . in regions where two precession frequencies match ,",
    "the srs excite the planetesimals eccentricities as angular momentum is monotonically transferred from the planetesimals to the gas giants .    in principle",
    ", all the planets contribute to the secular perturbation .",
    "two particularly strong srs among these are the @xmath9 and @xmath14 srs .",
    "they are dominated by the perturbations from jupiter and saturn , respectively @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we include these additional planetary contributions .",
    "however , contribution to the gas giants precession rates by the disk potential is comparable to that induced by jupiter s and saturn s interactions .",
    "when the solar nebula s mass distribution was comparable to that of the mmsn model , the @xmath9 sr was located near the asteroids main belt . during the advanced stages of nebula evolution , the precession rates induced by the disk decline with its diminishing surface density ( @xmath15 ) , resulting in the locations of these resonances sweeping through the solar system .",
    "today , the nebula is completely cleared of gas and the @xmath9 sr is located interior to the orbit of venus , whereas the @xmath14 sr is beside the terrestrial planet region , between the previous orbit of mars and the main asteroid belt .",
    "our work mainly focuses on the combined effects of two competitive processes : eccentricity excitation by mmrs and srs and eccentricity damping of the progenitors of the modern - day asteroids during the advanced stages of solar nebula evolution ( a few myr after cai formation ) . in this section",
    "we show that both small planetesimals and large embryos are preferentially cleared out from the main asteroid belt region , and discuss how these processes result in the observed sfd of the present - day asteroid belt .",
    "in this paper we propose that orbital decay associated with the sweeping sr is the main cause of size - selected clearing of the asteroid population from the main belt region . in order to quantitatively establish this conjecture , we present the results of a series of numerical simulations .",
    "the computational tool we employ is a modified version of the publicly available hermit4 package @xcite , which is ideally suited to carry out planetary system simulations .",
    "we consider systems consisting of the sun , jupiter , and saturn . for most models ,",
    "including the default model , the two gas giant planets are initialized at their present - day locations , with eccentricities slightly different from their present - day values .",
    "the planetesimals are represented by a population of coplanar ( with respect to the giant planet ) particles with initial semimajor axes distributed in the current domain of the main asteroid belt .",
    "these particles can be treated as massless , such that we can neglect their gravitational perturbation on the disk and on the gas giants , as well as their mutual gravitational interactions .",
    "the internal density of asteroids inferred from their orbital dynamics is in the range @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we assume that differentiation and fragmentation may have occurred among relatively large planetesimals , whereas small planetesimals may be considered to be pristine rubble piles .",
    "we construct a simple prescription for the planetesimals internal density , ranging from that of iron / stone meteorites with zero porosity ( @xmath17 ) for the relatively large ( with radius @xmath18  km ) planetesimals to that of water ice ( @xmath19 ) for the small planetesimals ( @xmath20  km ) .",
    "we also assume a transitional density @xmath21  g/@xmath22 for the intermediate - size ( 18  km @xmath23 100  km ) planetesimals .",
    "for the default model , we assume that both jupiter and saturn have already obtained their present - day masses . during the passage of @xmath9 and @xmath14",
    ", planetesimal eccentricity excitation occurs due to angular momentum transfer from these smaller bodies to jupiter and saturn ( without any energy exchange ) .",
    "the strength of the torque is a function of jupiter s and saturn s eccentricities ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively ) .",
    "these quantities also oscillate with an amplitude that is determined by the total angular momentum deficit of the system , i.e. , the difference between the actual sum of jupiter s and saturn s angular momentum and the maximum values for their given semimajor axes ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively ) .",
    "since jupiter s mass is substantially larger than that of saturn , it is adequate to specify the angular momentum deficit of the system by assigning an initial non - zero eccentricity , @xmath28 to jupiter only .",
    "while saturn is initialized with a circular orbit , its eccentricity is rapidly excited by jupiter . in principle",
    ", we can adopt the initial value of @xmath24 from the current angular momentum deficit of the solar system , or from the results of other numerical simulations .",
    "however , the angular momentum deficit of the system may have evolved due to the gas giants interaction with residual planetesimals and gas .",
    "taking these uncertainties into account , we consider two values for jupiter s initial eccentricity , which are slightly larger and slightly smaller than jupiter s present - day value , respectively . in the next section",
    "we discuss the consequences of these choices for @xmath24 .",
    "we mainly focus on the advanced stage of nebula evolution when the giant planets gas accretion is quenched by gap formation and type ii migration is stalled by the depletion of the disk gas @xcite . in our model",
    "we assume ( i ) a thin - disk approximation , ( ii ) an asymmetric power - law surface density distribution based on the mmsn model @xcite , with ( iii ) an axisymmetric gap near the gas giant @xcite , and ( iv ) that all planetary components ( gas giants and planetesimals ) are coplanar in the protoplanetary disk .    we adopt a thin - disk model with an axisymmetric surface density distribution , @xmath29 , of the form @xmath30 where",
    "@xmath31  au and @xmath32 is the time - dependent depletion function of the gas disk . in the mmsn model",
    ", @xmath33 is widely used with an initial surface density @xmath34 at the location of @xmath31  au .",
    "we approximate the density of the residual gas to be @xmath35 , with a disk scale height that has a similar form to that in the work of @xcite and @xcite , but is reduced by a factor of two : @xmath36 ( see further discussions in  [ sec : disk ] ) .",
    "this relatively small thickness is appropriate for the advanced stages of disk depletion @xcite .",
    "the characteristic decay time scale is chosen to be @xmath37  myr for the default models .",
    "the initial time ( @xmath38 ) is set to be the start of gas depletion ( rather than the epoch of cai formation ) .",
    "this definition is consistent with the assumed prior emergence of jupiter at the onset of our computation . in comparison with observational data",
    ", @xmath39 corresponds to the duration for transition from classical to weak - line disks .",
    "this time scale may be somewhat shorter than the average age of stars with detectable ir excess in their continuum spectral energy distribution , though it is comparable to the observationally inferred evolutionary time scales for transitional disks @xcite .",
    "although the detailed dynamical evolution of the residual planetesimals may depend on the chosen model parameters , including the functional forms of @xmath29 and @xmath39 , this working disk model provides an adequate set of initial conditions to generate several illustrative examples .",
    "we compute the disk gravity on the gas giants ( jupiter and saturn ) and the planetesimals separately , because the apsidal precession of the planetesimals by the gas disk is dominated by the gas in their neighborhood , whereas the gas giants apsidal precession caused by disk gravity is sensitive to the gap structure @xcite .",
    "gas giants that have opened a gap experience a gravitational force that depends on the locations of the inner and outer boundary of the gap @xcite : @xmath40 several models are presented here . in all models , we set the semimajor axis of jupiter to its present - day value ( 5.2  au ) and @xmath41au in accordance with the results of numerical simulations @xcite . in the default model and several other models",
    ", we also set saturn s semimajor axis to its present - day value ( 9.58  au ) and adopt @xmath42au following the results of numerical simulations @xcite . in all models",
    "we find that the dynamical evolution of jupiter s and saturn s orbits and the propagation of the @xmath9 and @xmath14 srs depend sensitively on @xmath43 and weakly on @xmath44 . for computational convenience ,",
    "we adopt the same values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 in all models presented here .",
    "the effect of gravity on the planetesimals is more complex .",
    "even though the gravity experienced by the planetesimals is usually dominated by bodies in the nearby region , planetesimals in the region close to the inner edge ( @xmath43 ) of the truncated disk are also affected by the presence of the gap .",
    "we therefore combine the prescription constructed in @xcite with the `` gap effect '' of @xcite to compute the disk s gravity on the planetesimals located at radius @xmath45 .",
    "we find @xmath46 while mmrs and srs excite the orbits of planetesimals , residual gas in the nebula also damps the eccentricity of the planetesimals . for small ( sub - kilometer - size ) planetesimals , this process operates mainly through hydrodynamic drag @xcite . for large ( super - moon - size ) embryos",
    ", the main eccentricity - damping mechanism is planet - disk tidal interaction @xcite . whereas the srs remove angular momentum and preserve the energy of planetesimal orbits , eccentricity damping leads to the dissipation of energy without changes in the angular momentum of their orbits",
    "consequently , planetesimals undergo inward migration during orbital circularization . for those planetesimals whose eccentricities",
    "are damped efficiently , the orbital decay is kept in pace with the inward propagation of the @xmath9 sr . these planetesimals `` surf '' over extended radial distances .    with a simple approximation",
    "@xcite we compute the effect of eccentricity damping with a drag force that reduces the amplitude of the planetesimals epicyclic motion around their guiding centers such that @xmath47 in this expression , the motion of the gas is assumed to be axisymmetric and in the azimuthal direction with an amplitude @xmath48 , where the dimensionless parameter @xmath49 , with @xmath50 as the sound speed , represents the contribution from the pressure gradient @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath51 is different for the small and large planetesimals .",
    "the eccentricities of small planetesimals are mainly damped by hydrodynamic drag .",
    "since the planetesimal radii @xmath52 are much larger than the molecular mean free path in the gas , the stokes drag law @xcite can be applied in our model , and it operates on a timescale @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the internal density of the planetesimals , @xmath55 is the relative velocity between gas and asteroids .",
    "this expression has a factor of 3/8 discrepancy from that in @xcite , and in the limit of a large reynolds number , the drag coefficient is @xmath56 .",
    "the eccentricity of large embryos is damped by the torque associated with their tidal interaction by the disk gas at their lindblad resonances @xcite on a time scale @xmath57 in addition , the corotation torque ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also contributes to the eccentricity damping .",
    "the corotation torque has a similar dependence on the surface density and temperature distribution in the disk and a magnitude that is a few times larger than the lindblad torque . for simplicity",
    ", we artificially enhance the total tidal damping from the expression in equation ( [ eq : t2 ] ) by a factor of five .",
    "note that @xmath58 , so that the efficiency of tidal damping increases with the mass of the planetesimals and embryos .    as the efficiency of eccentricity damping decreases over time , the locations of the @xmath9 and @xmath14 srs move inward as the solar nebula",
    "is globally depleted over several @xmath39 .",
    "nevertheless , the combined effect of the mechanisms described above can clear a large fraction of the residual planetesimals from the main asteroid belt region .",
    "after @xmath59 , gas is severely depleted in the disk and the @xmath9 sr passes through the present - day orbit of mars .",
    "the concentration of planetesimals around @xmath60  au increases , and as a result , their collisional probability increases . based on the results of their numerical simulations , @xcite",
    "suggest that the associated giant impacts may have promoted the final assemblage of the earth and mars , as well as the giant impact that has led to the formation of the moon .",
    "the chronology of this scenario is consistent with the age estimate of the earth based on radiogenic dating of hafnium isotopes @xcite .",
    "for our fiducial models we adopt jupiter s present - day eccentricity @xmath61 as our initial condition .",
    "the embedded planetesimals are initialised with a semimajor axis distribution @xmath62 the contribution of the hydrodynamic drag and the planetesimal - disk tidal interaction imply that the total damping efficiency is closely correlated with the size of the planetesimals .",
    "figure [ fig : a_t_ap3 ] shows how the sweeping sr clears planetesimals from a representative primordial location ( 3  au ) .",
    "we consider four representative cases .",
    "the left panels show the results for small ( 10  km ) and large ( 1000  km ) planetesimals , which are significantly influenced by gas drag and type i damping , respectively .",
    "the right panels present the results for intermediate - size planetesimals ( 300 and 500  km ) .",
    "the efficiency of eccentricity damping for the intermediate - size planetesimals is lower than both the small and the large planetesimals .    at the early stage of evolution , the small and large planetesimals ( left panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : a_t_ap3 ] ) undergo inward migration due to hydrodynamic and type i tidal drag , respectively . in contrast , the intermediate - size planetesimals preserve their initial semimajor axes ( right panels ) .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath14 srs sweep through this region after @xmath63 and all the planetesimals experience a rapid eccentricity excitation .",
    "efficient eccentricity damping causes the 10 and 1000  km sized planetesimals to undergo considerable inward migration . due to the relatively low eccentricity - damping efficiency ,",
    "a fraction of the planetesimals with intermediate sizes remain near their initial locations .",
    "however , most of them are also lost from the main belt region .",
    "the retention probability is determined by the planetesimals orbital phase during the srs passage through their semimajor axis .",
    "the retained planetesimals have modest residual eccentricities .",
    "based on these results , we infer that ( i ) nearly all planetesimals larger than the moon or smaller than @xmath64  km are likely to undergo extensive orbital decay and are evacuated from 3 au and ( ii ) some , but not all , intermediate - size asteroids may survive the passage of the @xmath9 and @xmath14 srs and retain their initial semimajor axis at 3 au .",
    "these outcomes provide a potential explanation for the depletion and size selection of residual planetesimals from the asteroid main belt region .        in order to generalize the results above",
    ", we consider other initial @xmath65 values for two groups of planetesimals , according to their sensitivity to orbital damping : ( i ) the strong - damping class and ( ii ) the weak - damping class .",
    "for the strong damping class , we take planetesimals of size 10  km as a representative case .",
    "figure [ fig : a_t_rp10 ] shows the evolution of the semimajor axis , perihelion , and aphelion distances , starting with four different initial semimajor axes , @xmath66  au , @xmath67  au , @xmath68  au , and @xmath69  au .",
    "these locations cover the entire region of interest .",
    "after time @xmath70 , all four representative planetesimals have undergone orbital decay to regions closer to the sun than the main belt region .    within @xmath71 ,",
    "hydrodynamic drag leads to a fractional orbital decay for the planetesimals initially located at 3.5 au . as these planetesimals pass through jupiter s and saturn s mmrs and srs ,",
    "their eccentricities are excited .",
    "subsequent eccentricity damping leads to orbital decay . provided that @xmath26 remains constant , the location of the mmr is fixed . in the region close to jupiter (",
    "@xmath72  au ) , its low - order ( especially 2:1 ) mmrs are primarily responsible for the excitation and subsequent inward migration of planetesimals @xcite .",
    "closer to the sun , however , the torque induced by higher - order mmrs is limited by the small magnitude of @xmath24 .",
    "the planetesimals eccentricity excitation and orbital evolution are dominated by the srs . during disk depletion ,",
    "the locations of the @xmath9 and @xmath14 srs are relocated closer to the sun .",
    "it is therefore possible for some planetesimals to be continually excited by the evolving srs .",
    "after @xmath73 , there is little residual gas left in the disk to induce any significant ( i ) precession for jupiter or saturn and ( ii ) eccentricity damping for the planetesimals .",
    "consequently , the propagation of the @xmath9 and @xmath14 srs is stalled inside the orbit of venus and outside the orbit of mars , respectively .",
    "the planetesimals also retain their eccentricities .",
    "the contributions of the mmrs and srs can be distinguished by the evolution of the planetesimals semimajor axis and eccentricity .",
    "the planetesimal semimajor axes evolve through several low - order mmrs , including the 5:2 , 3:1 , and 4:1 mmrs . in the limit of small @xmath24 ,",
    "the passages through these other mmrs ( apart from the powerful 2:1 mmr ) do not lead to strong eccentricity excitation and significant planetesimal migration .",
    "nevertheless , the planetesimals response to the 3:1 and 4:1 mmrs is enhanced when the passage is partly coupled with the propagation of the @xmath9 and @xmath14 srs .    for planetesimals in the weak - damping class , the situation is somewhat different from the strong - damping class ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : a_t_ap3 ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : e_a_t_rp100 ] , we show the orbital evolution of planetesimals in the weak - damping class with a representative size , @xmath74  km . these planetesimals orbits evolve under the combined effect of mmrs and the sweeping secular resonance .",
    "figure [ fig : e_a_t_rp100 ] shows how the @xmath9 and @xmath14 srs sweep through the main belt region .",
    "we compare the analytical solutions for @xmath9 ( black arrow ) and @xmath14 ( grey arrow ) srs with the numerical results of  [ sec : nmethod ] .",
    "orbital excitation occurs between 2.9  au and 2.1  au , and eccentricity variations are consistent with the analytical predictions for the @xmath9 and @xmath14 srs .",
    "the only exception is the case where the planetesimals are initially located beyond 3  au ( @xmath75  au ) , this region is dominated by the extended 2:1 mmr , and these planetesimals are excited prior to the passage of the ssr .",
    "we can therefore infer that the original location of planetesimals in the main belt region determines whether their excitation is dominated by either the mmr or by the sweeping sr , irrespective of the rate of eccentricity damping they experience .",
    "in general , the mmr plays a key role in exciting the eccentricity for planetesimals with initial @xmath76  au , while for those with initial @xmath77  au , the @xmath9 and @xmath14 srs are mainly responsible for their angular momentum deficit .",
    "the observed present - day sfd in the main asteroid belt appears to have a transition at around @xmath78  km ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this transition has been interpreted in terms of a cutoff in the population of small asteroids shortly after their formation .",
    "such an initial sfd may either be attributed to either the preferential formation of large asteroids or the clearing of small embryos due to a sweeping sr . in this work , we presume that the existence of a protoplanetary disk undertakes the natural selection role , rather than invoking a new formation mechanism . in this scenario",
    "there are two key processes at play : ( i ) planetesimals in the main asteroid belt region can be significantly excited as srs ( in this work the @xmath9 and @xmath14 srs ) propagate through the region ; and ( ii ) the excited planetesimals experience dispersive inward migration due to the size - dependent eccentricity damping force .    in figure",
    "[ fig : r_t1_t2_td_i_f ] , we show this dependence for an assumed initial size distribution @xmath79 , for a set of representative planetesimals with sizes in the range of @xmath80  km . in order to illustrate the size dependence on the two damping mechanisms , we analyze the efficiency of these effects separately .",

    "the observed size distribution of the small known asteroids can be produced from the subsequent collisional fragmentation process .",
    "there are several families of asteroids that bear the signature of collisional fragmentation @xcite .",
    "the size dependence of the drag force for eccentricity damping leads to differential inward migration rates .",

    "instead , we consider the possibility that eccentricity excitation by ssrs induces planetesimals to undergo frequent orbit crossings , and that their inclinations were subsequently excited to their observed values by their mutual perturbations and close encounters .    in order to verify the possibility , we extend our default model with 100 massless planetesimals plus several large embryos ( sizes ranging between 1000 and 3000  km ) , with semimajor axis randomly placed between 2.1 and 3.3  au .",

    "we showed with the parameters of model @xmath85 , that the mutual perturbations between planetesimals ( with sizes in the range of @xmath157  km ) and a few embryos ( with sizes @xmath158  km ) can adequately excite the inclinations of intermediate - size planetesimals to observed values ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a_i_r ] ) .",
    "we suggest that these planetesimals are most likely to be the progenitors of the asteroids as they are preferentially retained in our model .",
    "an implication of the embedded - embryo scenario is that a population of relatively massive embryos needs to be retained in the main belt region as scattering agents until most of the residual planetesimals are cleared . due to dynamical friction , the velocity dispersion of the embryos is expected to be smaller than that of the lower - mass planetesimals @xcite . however",
    ", a protracted retention of embryos may lead to the formation of terrestrial planets in the main belt region .",
    "@xcite showed that the spacial distribution of the terrestrial planets requires their building blocks to be confined within @xmath13 au .",
    "a confinement mechanism has been suggested by @xcite .",
    "this  grand - tack \" scenario is based on the assumption that due to its tidal interaction with the disk gas ( in consort with saturn ) , jupiter may have migrated inward through the solar nebula and then outward over a few au to its present - day location . during this course of this excursion , most of the planetary building blocks would be swept into the inner solar system .",
    "the probability of such an excursion is uncertain .",
    "since jupiter migration is driven by its tidal interaction with the disk , this process can not occur after the depletion of the disk gas .    in the embedded - embryos scenario @xcite , the time scale for @xmath159 planetesimal clearing by an assumed population of embedded mars - size embryos ( with a total mass of @xmath160 ) is @xmath64  myr , which is comparable to or longer than the observed gas depletion time of @xmath8 myr @xcite .",
    "the  grand - tack \" scenario would make the embedded - embryos scenario obsolete if both embryos and planetesimals are appreciably cleared from the main belt region by a migrating jupiter .",
    "the removal efficiency is independent of planetesimals mass and radius , and",
    "therefore it does not lead to a size selection for the retained progenitors of asteroids . partial reduction of the embryo population would reduce the scattering centers and their efficiency in the planetesimals inclination excitation .    in our model ,",
    "the rate of planetesimals orbital decay is mostly determined by the magnitude of eccentricity and its damping timescale . in the unperturbed regions , the velocity dispersion of small planetesimals is modest and that of large planetesimals is small .",
    "but their eccentricity is excited above @xmath161 during the passage of srs or mmrs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : e_a_t_rp100 ] ) . with relatively small damping timescale ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_t1_t2_td_i_f ] ) , the large planetesimals ( embryos ) undergo orbital decay in consort with the inwardly sweeping srs . in contrast , the eccentricity damping is less efficient for the intermediate - size planetesimals , and they are preferentially retained with eccentricities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a_e_r ] ) comparable to that ( @xmath101 ) of most asteroids with radius larger than 50  km @xcite .",
    "the time scales for @xmath9 to propagate to the present semimajor axes of mars and earth are @xmath162 and @xmath163 , or @xmath164 and @xmath165 myr , for the observationally inferred value @xmath166 myr .",
    "the passage of the @xmath9 sr leads to eccentricity excitation , which promotes orbit crossing and physical collisions among the inwardly migrating embryos . @xcite and @xcite proposed a  dynamical shake - up \" model to account for the formation time scale of terrestrial planets as inferred from cosmochemical data @xcite and their modest eccentricities .      throughout this paper",
    ", we have emphasized that efficient damping of excited eccentricity is essential for the clearing of planetesimals . @xcite",
    "have already shown that with nearly circular orbits , jupiter and saturn srs can not significantly excite the planetesimals eccentricity over the observed gas depletion time scale of @xmath167 myr . in model @xmath85",
    ", we show that a significant fraction of jupiter and saturn present - day angular momentum deficit is required for their srs to excite the planetesimals eccentricity to an adequate level for the depletion of the initial planetesimals in the main belt region to the current asteroid population",
    ". we also simulated model @xmath125 with a reduced amount of angular momentum deficit for the jupiter and saturn system .",
    "a comparison of the results generated from models @xmath85 and @xmath125 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : r_df_ej ] ) confirms the expectation that the efficiency of eccentricity excitation and planetesimal clearing increases with @xmath24 .",
    "several previous models have suggested that saturn may have migrated outward over some significant distances .",
    "for example , the nice model has attributed the lhb to the passage of saturn through jupiter s 2:1 mmr which is currently located at 8.18  au . in model @xmath168 , we consider the possibility of a closer initial jupiter - saturn separation .",
    "the results of these simulations show that both the mmrs and ssrs can efficiently clear both small and large planetesimals while retaining intermediate - size planetesimals in the main belt region if , during the epoch of disk depletion , jupiter and saturn were sufficiently close to their present - day location ( models @xmath85 and @xmath130 ) . if jupiter and saturn were close to each other s 2:1 mmr ( model @xmath131 ) during the epoch of nebula depletion , @xmath169 in mass of the initial population of planetesimals",
    "may be retained .",
    "this total mass is less than that in the asteroid belt .",
    "more mass may be retained to accommodate a sufficiently larger reservoir of residual planetesimals for the lhb if the nebula depletion time scale is substantially less than 1 myr .",
    "these results place some constraints but do not eliminate the possibility that saturn may have undergone extensive outward migration . after the nebula depletion , passage of saturn through its 2:1 mmr with jupiter , as envisioned in the nice model , may cause the excitation of terrestrial planets as well as asteroids eccentricity beyond their present - day values @xcite .",
    "if saturn was initially located between jupiter s 2:1 mnr and its present - day location ( e.g. , with a semimajor axis @xmath170 smaller than its value today ) , the sweeping path of @xmath14 would be stalled outside the inner boundary of the main belt region .",
    "models @xmath128 and @xmath129 show that a population of planetesimals of all sizes would be retained around the provisional location of the @xmath14 sr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v56_r_af ] ) .",
    "when saturn eventually migrates to its present - day location after the disk gas is depleted , the eccentricity of the residual planetesimals would be excited as the @xmath14 sr sweeps past them , but they would not undergo orbital decay without any eccentricity damping .",
    "although the orbits of some highly eccentric planetesimals may be destablized by the terrestrial planets perturbation , a large fraction of the residual planetesimals of all sizes would be retained within the main belt region .",
    "we mainly focus on the dynamical depletion of asteroids in the main belt . during this process ,",
    "the transitional disk and the gas giants are responsible for the gravitational perturbations on the asteroids . in this paper",
    ", we assumed a global depletion factor for the solar nebula .",
    "photoevaporation and disk winds may lead to preferential locations for mass loss . under some circumstances ,",
    "inside - out clearing of the disk may promote planetesimals inclination excitation .",
    "in addition , the disk also provides a damping force that affects the embedded planetesimals . in most models",
    ", we have not included the mutual interaction between planetesimals .",
    "although this assumption is adequate for the determination of the planetesimals eccentricity and semimajor axis evolution , this effect needs to be included ( as in the modified default model ) to enable us to account for the excitation of planetesimals inclination by embedded embryos ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a_i_r ] ) .",
    "we have also neglected collisions between asteroids and their subsequent fragmentation .",
    "quantitative estimates suggest that the collision time scale is @xmath171 gyr for asteroids larger than @xmath172 km such that the transitions of sfd power index in this size range have not evolved significantly since the formation of the solar system .",
    "nevertheless , collisions and fragmentations may have significantly modified the small - size range of the observed sfd .",
    "follow - up investigations on planetesimal - embryo interaction and on fragmentation process are warranted .",
    "our model supports the ssr model as the process that lead to the asteroids present - day sfd .",
    "since all planetary systems originally form in circumstellar gas disks that evolve and ultimately dissipate , this model , as studied in this paper , can be applied to construct models that account for the kinematic structure of a wide range of observed extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "such analysis will provide useful clues and place important constraints on protoplanets birth environment and their post - formation dynamical evolution ( zheng , x.c .",
