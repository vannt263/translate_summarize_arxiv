    "<S> we realize a cavity magnon - microwave photon system in which magnetic dipole interaction mediates strong coupling between collective motion of large number of spins in a ferrimagnet and the microwave field in a three - dimensional cavity . by scaling down the cavity size and increasing number of spins , </S>",
    "<S> an ultrastrong coupling regime is achieved with a cooperativity reaching 12600 . </S>",
    "<S> interesting dynamic features including classical rabi oscillation , magnetically induced transparency , and purcell effect are demonstrated in this highly versatile platform , highlighting its great potential for coherent information processing .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction. _ systems with strong light - matter interaction have played crucial roles in quantum @xcite and classical information processing @xcite as they enable coherent information transfer between distinct physical platforms . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that systems with large electric dipole moment can couple strongly with the optical fields . </S>",
    "<S> however , the possibility of strong light - matter interaction via magnetic dipoles is mostly ignored . </S>",
    "<S> it is only recently that imamoglu @xcite has pointed out the direction to achieve strong light - matter interaction using collective excitations of spin ensembles , and visioned the promise of quantum information processing in these systems . </S>",
    "<S> since then , various implementations have been proposed and experimentally investigated . </S>",
    "<S> ensembles including ultracold atomic clouds @xcite , molecules @xcite , nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond @xcite , and ion doped crystals @xcite have been used to couple to microwave resonators or even superconducting qubits .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetic materials provide a promising alternative to achieve strong light - matter interaction , because they have spin density many orders of magnitude higher than dilute spin ensembles investigated previously . </S>",
    "<S> for example , soykal _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite predicted that the nanomagnet - photon cavity can achieve strong light - matter interaction assisted by an extremely large number of spins in nanomagnets . in this letter , we realize such a hybrid system which consists of a sphere of yttrium iron garnet ( yig , y@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 ) and a three - dimensional ( 3d ) microwave cavity . </S>",
    "<S> this new system possesses several distinguishing advantages . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , yig has a high spin density ( @xmath3 ) exceeding previous spin ensembles by orders of magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , spin excitations in single crystal and highly purified yig possess very low damping rate . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , the spin - spin interactions through either exchange or dipolar interaction give rise to dispersions of spin excitations ( defined modes ) in yig , which can be used for spatial multiplexing . </S>",
    "<S> it is also intriguing that there is nonlinear interaction between excitations in the yig , which enable nonlinear amplification and control of magnons . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , bose - einstein condensates of quasi - equilibrium magnons have been realized at room temperature @xcite .    with the proposed hybrid system , </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally demonstrate the coherent coupling between magnons ( the collective spin excitation in yig ) and microwave photons . because of the large spin number in yig , strong coupling can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> experimental demonstration has been previously reported using a yig thin film on a planar superconducting microwave cavity , and a high cooperativity of 1350 has been achieved @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we show that by utilizing a spherical yig geometry and 3d microwave cavity , our system obtains additional advantages such as higher quality ( @xmath4 ) factors and more uniform coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our 3d system is highly tunable in various parameters , which allows us to observe characteristic phenomena associated with distinct parameter regimes , including the magnetically induced transparency ( mit , the magnetic analog of eit , the electromagnetically induced transparency ) and the purcell effect . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by scaling the device dimensions , our 3d system can enter the so - called `` ultra - strong coupling '' ( usc ) regime , where the coupling rate reaches a large fraction of the oscillation frequency , sufficient to violate the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although these important features are measured in the classical regime , our results suggest important prospects of operating the coupled system in quantum regime at millikelvins where the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) linewidth of yig can go down to @xmath5 t @xcite with magnon lifetime extended to as long as about 4 microseconds .        _ </S>",
    "<S> experimental setup. _ the image of our device is shown in the bottom of fig.[fig : sc](a ) , consisting of a 3d microwave cavity ( only the bottom half is shown ) and a highly polished yig sphere which serves as the magnon cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the microwave cavity is a box machined from high conductivity copper to obtain high @xmath4 factor at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the box with inner dimension of @xmath6 mm@xmath7 gives a te101 mode at @xmath8 ghz with a linewidth of a few mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated mode distribution ( using comsol 3.5 ) of the cavity mode is given in the top of fig.[fig : sc](a ) , where the arrows and colors indicate the magnetic field directions and their amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic measurement is carried out with a vector network analyzer ( vna ) by probing the reflection of the microwave cavity through a coaxial cable antenna .    </S>",
    "<S> the yig sphere is placed inside the microwave cavity and biased with a static magnetic field @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic components of the microwave field perpendicular to the bias field induce the spin flip , and thus excite the magnon mode in yig . here , we are only interested in the lowest order fmr mode , which is a uniform collective mode that all the spins precess in phase . </S>",
    "<S> this mode has the highest coupling strength given that the microwave magnetic field around the yig sphere is approximately uniform [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ] as the wavelength @xmath10 with @xmath11 is the radius of the yig sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the uniform magnon mode linearly depends on the bias field where @xmath12 , with @xmath13 ghz / t is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath14 is determined by the anisotropy field . </S>",
    "<S> the bias magnetic field is tunable in the range of @xmath15 t , corresponding to a magnon frequency from few hundreds of mhz to about @xmath16 ghz .    </S>",
    "<S> _ strong coupling. _ to study the microwave photon - magnon interaction , we adjust the bias field so that magnon is near - resonance with the cavity s te101 mode . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest coupling strength is obtained by placing the yig sphere ( 0.36 mm in diameter ) at the position with the maximum microwave magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the measured microwave reflection spectra with respect to the bias magnetic field @xmath17 is plotted in fig.[fig : sc](b ) , which exhibits an avoided crossing at @xmath18 mt . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between microwave photon and magnon can be described by the hamiltonian with rwa : @xmath19    where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for the microwave photon at frequency @xmath22 . for the magnon , the collective spin excitations </S>",
    "<S> are approximately represented by the boson operator @xmath23 with holstein  </S>",
    "<S> primakoff approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling strength @xmath24 between the two systems is : @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the resonance frequency and @xmath27 is the modal volume of the microwave cavity resonance , @xmath28 is the vacuum permeability , @xmath29 is the total number of spins , and @xmath30 is the spin number of the ground state fe@xmath31 ion in yig . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient @xmath32 describes the spatial overlap and polarization matching conditions between the microwave field and the magnon mode @xcite .    as shown in fig.[fig : sc](b ) , the avoided crossing indicates the strong coupling between the microwave photon and the magnon , with the coupling strength @xmath33 . we can also extract the dissipation rates of both the microwave photon ( @xmath34 mhz ) and the magnon ( @xmath35 mhz ) . </S>",
    "<S> the measured spectrum agrees well with the theoretical prediction of the reflection from the microwave cavity : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the external coupling to the cavity . for the coupled oscillator model described by the hamiltonian in eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) , hybridized photon - magnon quasi - particles @xmath38 appear for @xmath39 , with energies being @xmath40 . when the coupling strength exceeds the dissipation rates ( @xmath41 ) , the system reaches the classical strong coupling regime . with the experiment parameters , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a cooperativity of @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> the strong coupling implies coherent dynamics between the photon and the magnon , such as rabi oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we investigated the temporary dynamics of photons in the strongly coupled system . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , by monitoring the time evolution of the cavity output after a short pulse excitation , we obtain the time traces that agree well with the theoretical prediction of rabi oscillations [ fig.[fig : sc](c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the slight asymmetry about the bias magnetic field is due to the nonzero duration of the excitation pulse . clearly , the cavity energy experiences periodic oscillation aside from the exponential decay , demonstrating the coherent energy exchange between photon and magnon . at @xmath43 mt where the magnon is on resonance with the microwave photon </S>",
    "<S> , we have the highest signal extinction , indicating complete energy exchange between the two systems . </S>",
    "<S> also at this bias magnetic field , the oscillation period is the longest , corresponding to the narrowest gap ( @xmath44 ) in the avoided crossing regime of the reflection spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the time trace for @xmath43 mt is plotted in fig.[fig : sc](d ) , showing a extinction ratio of more than 20 db , and a period of @xmath45 ns which agrees well with the coupling strength @xmath46 ns . the calculated oscillation signal ( solid line ) using the coupling strength and the decay rate obtained from the frequency spectrum shows excellent agreement with the measured time trace ( circles ) .    ) and photon ( @xmath21 ) system . </S>",

    "<S> there are different coupling regimes [ fig.[fig:4quad](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on coherent interactions with @xmath50 .    when the dissipation of the microwave cavity becomes dominant in the coupled system [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4quad](a ) , @xmath51 , the avoided crossing feature in the measured spectrum will disappear . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as we tune the bias magnetic field , an mit window passes through the broad microwave cavity resonance [ fig.[fig:4quad](c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the detuning of the magnon frequency , the transparency window shows up as an asymmetric fano - shape or symmetric peak . </S>",
    "<S> when the impedance matching [ @xmath52 in eq.([eq : reflection ] ) ] and on - resonance conditions are satisfied , the mit window height is @xmath53 and linewidth is @xmath54 . when the magnon is tuned on resonance with the microwave photon [ at @xmath55 mt , indicated by the dashed line in fig.[fig:4quad](c ) ] , we have maximum extinction with a lorentzian - shaped transparency window that replicates the magnon resonance [ fig.[fig:4quad](d ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the measured transparency window has a peak height of half unity with a maximum group delay of 110 ns . from the measured data , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding dissipation rates and the coupling strength are fitted using eq.([eq : reflection ] ) as @xmath56 mhz , @xmath57 mhz and @xmath58 mhz , corresponding to a cooperativity value of @xmath59 for this specific device configuration .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> when the magnon decay dominates [ fig.[fig:4quad](a ) , @xmath60 , we enter the purcell regime , with an enhanced decay of the microwave cavity photon due to its coupling to the lossy magnon . according to eq.([eq : reflection ] ) , the effective dissipation rate of the cavity is @xmath61 , enhanced by a purcell factor ( @xmath62 ) as a result of the photon - magnon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> such linewidth broadening is confirmed by the measured reflection spectra at various bias magnetic fields [ fig.[fig:4quad](e ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> although the magnon resonance can not be resolved due to its large linewidth , its magnetic dependence is inherited by the coupled mode and shows up as a small bend . for a clear comparison , the resonance spectra of the microwave cavity with ( at @xmath63 mt ) and without ( at @xmath64 mt ) the coupling to the magnon </S>",
    "<S> are plotted in the inset of fig.[fig:4quad](f ) . </S>",
    "<S> due to the purcell effect , the dissipation rate of the microwave resonance ( @xmath65 ) increases from @xmath66 mhz to @xmath67 mhz , and the extinction ratio is reduced by 25% . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have @xmath68 and @xmath69 . from the experiment results , we can extract the coupling strength @xmath70 mhz and the magnon decay rate @xmath71 mhz that indeed fall inside the purcell regime .    </S>",
    "<S> a more direct characterization of such purcell effect is obtained by measuring the cavity photon lifetime . since </S>",
    "<S> now the magnon dissipates very quickly , an accelerated exponential decay instead of a rabi oscillation is expected after a pulsed excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the decay curves at bias magnetic fields @xmath48 and @xmath49 are plotted in fig.[fig:4quad](f ) , which gives a lifetime of @xmath72 ns and @xmath73 ns , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these time domain measurements perfectly match the dissipation rates measured above in the frequency domain . </S>",
    "<S> both the time and frequency domain measurements give a purcell factor of about @xmath74 .    . </S>",
    "<S> solid line is the theoretical prediction . </S>",
    "<S> red star indicates a device reaching the ultrastrong coupling . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) ultrastrong coupling spectrum in the @xmath75 band . </S>",
    "<S> red arrows show the ultrastrongly coupled magnon - microwave photon mode . ]    _ ultrastrong coupling. _ beyond the four coupling regimes discussed above determined by the ratio of coupling strength and dissipation rates , there exists a usc regime where the coupling strength becomes considerably comparable with the magnon frequency . in the usc regime , the rwa used in the hamiltonian given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is no longer valid . </S>",
    "<S> the usc has attracted intensive interests being a potential playground for ultra - fast coherent controlling and exploring new physics beyond rwa . </S>",
    "<S> it is notable that in our experiments by engineering the microwave cavity and the yig sphere , we can _ tune _ the coupling strength and eventually extend our coupled system to the usc regime . from eq.([eq : g ] ) we can see that the coupling strength @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the volume of the yig sphere which determines the spin number ( @xmath78 ) . by increasing the resonance frequency and the yig sphere size while reducing the microwave cavity size we can increase @xmath79 and consequently the coupling strength @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling strengths measured in nine devices of varying cavity and sphere dimensions are displayed in fig.[fig : ultra](a ) as a function of @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement is obtained in comparison with the theoretical prediction ( solid line ) . during the experiments , </S>",
    "<S> different resonance frequencies ranging from the x band to the k@xmath80 band ( @xmath81 ghz to @xmath82 ghz ) are tested , showing the great tunability of the magnon .    </S>",
    "<S> an ultra - strong coupling strength of @xmath83 ghz ( represented by the star ) has been achieved at a resonance frequency of @xmath84 ghz , where the microwave cavity size is dramatically reduced to @xmath85 mm@xmath7 , and the yig sphere diameter is increased to @xmath86 mm ( corresponding to 3.5@xmath87 spins ) . </S>",
    "<S> this coupled system yields a ratio of @xmath88 and reaches the usc regime . </S>",
    "<S> figure[fig : ultra](b ) plots the reflection spectrum of the usc . due to the large yig sphere size which is now comparable with the microwave cavity , the microwave fields penetrating the yig sphere is no longer as uniform and therefore excites non - uniform magnon modes , as labeled in fig.[fig : ultra](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> these non - uniform modes have higher frequency , and mostly couple weakly with the microwave cavity . also at such high frequencies , the cavity resonance experiences higher losses . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , due to the ultrahigh coupling rate , an ultra high cooperativity of @xmath89 is realized with the extracted dissipation rates of the microwave photon and the magnon resonance are @xmath90 mhz and @xmath91 mhz , respectively .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusion. _ we have experimentally realized coherent coupling between microwave photon and magnon at room temperature , and demonstrated the great potential of magnon as an information carrier . strong coupling with high cooperativity has been achieved using spectroscopic measurement , and the coherent energy exchange has been illustrated with the rabi oscillation measurement in the time domain . </S>",
    "<S> both the mit and purcell effects have been observed , providing various possible applications for our proposed system . </S>",
    "<S> the coherent coupling can be further extended into the usc regime with a coupling strength of 2.5 ghz measured at 37.5 ghz carrier frequency , which is a new regime where the rwa approximation may be invalidated . </S>",
    "<S> compared with previous systems , our system possesses a range of advantages thanks to the collective motion of large number of spins and uniform magnetic coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the excellent tunability properties of magnon system , together with its extended lifetime , reduced thermal excitation and the ability of coupling to microwave qubits , makes it a very promising candidate as a transducer that can interconnect different systems such as photonics , mechanics and microwave circuits .    </S>",
