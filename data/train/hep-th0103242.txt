    "the relation between two dimensional yang - mills theories in the large @xmath7 limit and two dimensional string theories was established by gross and taylor in a series of papers  @xcite .",
    "they showed that the coefficients of the @xmath8 expansion of the ym partition function , with gauge group @xmath9 on a riemann surface@xmath10 of area @xmath11 and arbitrary genus @xmath12 count the number of string configurations without folds , namely the number of branched coverings of the surface .",
    "as a matter of fact two dimensional ym does not give exactly a pure theory of coverings for two reasons : the presence of two distinct chiral sectors , which are weakly coupled by pointlike tubes and correspond to the two possible orientations of the world sheet , and the presence , for @xmath13 , of the so called @xmath14 points , whose geometric meaning was eventually clarified in  @xcite .    a lattice gauge theory of complex @xmath15 matrices that describes , in the large @xmath7 limit , a pure theory of branched coverings with just one chiral sector and without @xmath14 points was later discovered in  @xcite .",
    "in fact , when expanded in powers of @xmath16 , the partition function of this complex matrix model can be regarded as the generating function of the number of branched coverings @xmath17 that wrap around @xmath18 @xmath19 times . actually for finite @xmath7 only the first @xmath7 coefficient of the expansion correctly reproduce the corresponding @xmath17 and the generating function is only reproduced in the large @xmath7 limit .",
    "a similar property holds for two dimensional ym theories  @xcite .    for fixed @xmath19 ,",
    "the number of branched coverings @xmath17 is itself the partition function of a lattice gauge theory @xcite whose gauge group is the symmetric group @xmath1 and whose plaquette action is the standard heat - kernel action for @xmath1 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 labels the representations of @xmath1 of characters @xmath23 and dimensions @xmath24 ; @xmath25 is the area of the plaquette and the arbitrary coefficients @xmath26 carry all the information about the density of all different types of branch points .",
    "the relation between the lattice matrix theory of  @xcite and the @xmath1 gauge theory is a direct consequence of frobenius formula , as shown in  @xcite .",
    "a completely different way of obtainig a string theory from generalized two dimensional ym theories was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism is analogue to the one through which string configurations emerge in `` matrix string theory ''  @xcite and it is based on the quantization of a generalized ym theory in a unitary gauge .",
    "more precisely , one starts from the generalized action @xmath27 where the gauge group is u@xmath28 and @xmath29 is an arbitrary gauge invariant potential of the @xmath30 hermitian matrix as in this case it coincides with the number of times the world sheet of the string wraps round the target space .",
    "this marks an important difference between this approach and the one of @xcite or @xcite ] @xmath31 .",
    "one chooses the unitary gauge in which the matrix @xmath31 is diagonal .",
    "this gauge choice is incomplete , as it leaves a residual u@xmath2 gauge invariance .",
    "it is also affected by gribov ambiguities as at each point of the space - time manifold the gauge is determined up to an arbitrary permutation of the eigenvalues of @xmath31 .",
    "a global smooth diagonalization is then in general not possible because , as one goes round a loop non contractible to a point , the eigenvalues of @xmath31 may be subjected to a permutation .",
    "this gives origin to twisted sectors , which are in one - to - one correspondence with the homomorphisms @xmath32 of the homotopy group of @xmath10 onto the symmetric group @xmath1 , namely with the unbranched @xmath19-coverings of @xmath33 .    in four space - time dimensions",
    "unitary gauges lead to divergences when two eigenvalues coincide , and the theory is apparently non - renormalizable  @xcite in these gauges . in two dimensions",
    "these divergences still occur , but they are exactly cancelled in flat space - time .",
    "in fact there is an exact cancellation , due to a fermionic symmetry , between the contributions of the non - diagonal components of the gauge field and the ghost - antighost system  @xcite .",
    "this fermionic symmetry is however anomalous in presence of space - time curvature , and it appears that the only consistent way to eliminate the resulting divergences is to make use of the arbitrariness of the potential @xmath29 in ( [ genact ] ) and introduce in it a term , which depends on the curvature , that cancels exactly the anomaly . with this prescription",
    "the theory becomes completely abelian , consisting of @xmath19 u@xmath3 gauge theories , whose field strengths are the eigenvalues of @xmath31 , and which are only coupled , in each twisted sector , by the boundary conditions induced by the homomorphism @xmath32 .",
    "the original generalized ym theory , with u@xmath28 gauge group , is then described by a string theory ( unbranched coverings ) that covers @xmath18 @xmath19 times , and has a u@xmath3 gauge theory on its world sheet .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , this theory can be formulated as a lattice gauge theory whose gauge group @xmath34 is the semi - direct product of @xmath1 and u@xmath2 defined by the multiplication rule @xmath35 where @xmath36 can be represented as the @xmath30 matrix @xmath37 and @xmath38 is an element of @xmath1 .",
    "the twisted sectors considered in  @xcite did not include the possibility of branch points .",
    "correspondingly , the plaquette action in the @xmath34 lattice gauge theory had the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the remaining part of @xmath29 after the anomaly cancellation .",
    "the plaquette action for the @xmath1 subgroup in ( [ plact ] ) is just a delta function @xmath41 ; this denotes the absence of branch points .",
    "the problem of introducing twisted sectors that allow branch points , so that the strings carrying the u@xmath3 field can join and split , will be addressed in this paper . from the point of view of the lattice gauge theory of @xmath42",
    "this is equivalent to writing the most general heat kernel action for @xmath43 ( as it is done in eq .",
    "( [ heatker ] ) for the group @xmath1 ) .",
    "this entails finding an explicit expression for the characters of the irreducible representions of @xmath42 in terms of the characters of @xmath1 and u@xmath2 . from the point of view of the ( generalized ) yang - mills theory ,",
    "the string interactions should originate from non - perturbative effects , in analogy to what happens in the supersymmetric case of @xmath44 super yang ",
    "mills theory . in this case",
    "the string theory that arises in the diagonal gauge is the matrix string of @xcite , which is believed to be equivalent to the type iib string theory in the light - cone frame .",
    "the string interactions @xcite arise precisely because there are classical instantonic configurations @xcite which lead to a structure of eigenvalues describing a branched covering of the target spacetime manifold .",
    "the string coupling constant @xmath45 is , consistently with this picture , proportional to @xmath46 .    in our case",
    "it is not yet clear how to explicitely derive analogous instantonic configurations for the generalized yang - mills theory ; nevertheless we can investigate the interacting theory , i.e. the theory of branched coverings , irrespectively of its dynamical origin .",
    "in this section we will show that the partition function of @xmath19-coverings of a general riemann surface can be expressed as the partition function of a lattice gauge theory , defined on a cell decomposition of the surface , with the symmetric group @xmath1 as the gauge group .",
    "a covering of a _ target _",
    "riemann surface @xmath47 is essentially a smooth map f:_w_t from a _ covering _ surface @xmath48 ( the `` world - sheet '' ) to @xmath47 ( the `` target '' ) such that each point of @xmath47 has exactly @xmath19 counterimages in @xmath48 .",
    "each of these counterimages is said to belong to a different _ sheet _ of the covering surface .",
    "consider now a path @xmath49 in @xmath47 , from a point @xmath50 to a point @xmath51 .",
    "it is natural to define the @xmath19 _ liftings _ @xmath52 of @xmath49 as the paths on @xmath48 such that f_i=  .",
    "if the liftings of all closed , homotopically trivial paths are closed , the covering is said _",
    "unbranched_. otherwise it has branch points : these are points in @xmath47 such that a closed loop around them , when lifted , goes from one sheet of the coverings to a different one .",
    "therefore each branch point is associated to a non trivial permutation of the @xmath19 sheets of the coverings .",
    "consider now a cell decomposition of the target surface @xmath47 , made of @xmath53 sites , @xmath54 links and @xmath55 plaquettes , so that the euler formula gives the genus @xmath12 as _ 0-_1+_2=2 - 2 g  . to construct a branched @xmath19-covering of this discretized target surface ,",
    "consider @xmath19 copies of each plaquette @xmath56 of @xmath47 : these will be the plaquettes of @xmath48 .",
    "consider now two neighboring plaquettes @xmath57 and @xmath58 in @xmath47 , let @xmath59 be their common link , and glue each of the @xmath19 copies of @xmath57 to one of the @xmath19 copies of @xmath58 along @xmath59 according to a permutation @xmath60 . repeat the procedure for all links to construct the discretized version of the covering surface @xmath48 .    in this way one",

    "it is easier to visualize @xmath38 as associated to an oriented link of the _ dual _ lattice , that is the one in which sites and plaquettes are exchanged , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : dual ] .",
    "a dual link goes from a plaquette @xmath57 to a plaquette @xmath58 and its associated permutation dictates how to glue copies of @xmath57 to copies of @xmath58 .    a closed path around a site @xmath61 of @xmath47 will be represented in the discretized version as a plaquette of the dual lattice .",
    "if the ordered product of the permutations around the plaquette is not the identical permutation , then @xmath61 is a branch point of our covering : the liftings of the closed path to @xmath48 are not all closed , as some of them start on a sheet and end on a different one .",
    "therefore in our discretization the branch points of the coverings are localized on the lattice sites .",
    "6.8 cm 0.8 cm 4.8 cm    now we want to construct a model in which all possible branched @xmath19-coverings of a given ( discretized ) target surface are counted with boltzmann weights depending on their branch point structure .",
    "the previous discussion suggests that this model can be written as a lattice gauge theory with @xmath1 as the gauge group .",
    "the possible types of branch points are in one - to - one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of permutations , that is with the partitions of @xmath19 .",
    "to each conjugacy class we want to assign an arbitrary , positive boltzmann weight . therefore we must construct a lattice gauge theory of the symmetric group , defined on the discretized target surface : the boltzmann weight of a configuration will be _ s",
    "w_s(p_s )  , [ weight ] where the product is extended to all the sites , @xmath62 is the ordered product of the permutations on the dual links around the site @xmath61 , that is around the dual plaquette corresponding to the site @xmath61 and the weights @xmath63 vary in general from site to site and depend on the conjugacy class of @xmath64 only , namely : w_s(p)= w_s(qpq^-1 )  p , qs_n  .",

    "the normalization takes into account the arbitrary relabelings of the sheets on top of each plaquette .",
