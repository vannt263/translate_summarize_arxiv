    "the study of the stellar population in galaxies presents some unique challenges .",
    "first , the method used to characterize a stellar population is crucial as it provides constraints on theories of galaxy formation ( e.g. de lucia et al .",
    "second , age and metallicity dominated indicators should minimize the age - metallicity degeneracy described in the 3/2 worthey law ( worthey , trager & faber 1995 ) .",
    "finally , a galaxy s environment may be the dominant influence on its star formation history , further reducing the adequacy of the single stellar population ( ssp ) assumption .",
    "monolithic collapse models predict early - type systems with a central region that is more metal rich , slightly younger , and less @xmath16 enhanced than the outer parts .",
    "mergers may wash out any possible gradient present in the progenitors , although dissipation can trigger star formation in the cores of galaxies , creating age gradients .",
    "it is important to emphasize that we still lack firm quantitative estimates for many of these effects  @xcite .",
    "considering the impact of such predictions , we need large and well characterized samples to tackle this issue . the nearby universe ( @xmath17 ) provides a starting point , as we now have high quality data for large numbers of galaxies .",
    "the study of color gradients is motivated by the possibility of discriminating between different models of galaxy formation , and points to the real need for systematic and accurate measurements for a large and well controlled sample of etgs .",
    "these systems become gradually bluer in the outskirts ( e.g. peletier et al . 1990 ; goudfrooij et al .",
    "1994 ; michard 1999 ; wu et al .",
    "2005 ; cantiello et al . 2005 ; suh et al .",
    "although the age - metallicity degeneracy makes the interpretation of the color gradient troublesome , metallicity gradient seems to be main cause ( e.g. saglia et al . 2000 ; @xcite ; la barbera et al .",
    "small , positive age gradients are also consistent with observations ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and have been detected in the low - redshift population of etgs  @xcite .",
    "positive color gradients in high - redshift etgs have been observed by  @xcite , who found that about one - third of field etgs at @xmath18 have blue cores , in contrast to only @xmath19 at lower redshift ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility that color gradients could be due merely to dust in a well mixed stellar population has been considered ( e.g. goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ) but many etgs exhibit radial gradients of metal absorption features , which can not be attributed to dust ( e.g. gonzalez  1993 ; mehlert et al . 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , many etgs are undetected by iras at 60 @xmath20 and 100 @xmath20 .",
    "cosmological simulations do not yet have sufficient spatial resolution to provide reliable color gradients .",
    "however , chemo - dynamical simulations of etgs are starting to yield meaningful results for metallicity gradients , reproducing some observed population gradients ( see kobayashi 2004 ) .",
    "the last decade has witnessed the appearance of important observational studies using photometric and spectroscopic data to constrain age , metallicity and elemental abundances (  @xcite ) .",
    "they conclude that age and metallicity are anti - correlated for galaxies of a given luminosity .",
    "furthermore , poggianti et al .",
    "( 2001b ) find that in high density regimes a large fraction of systems shows no signs of star formation in their centers .",
    "another important finding relating star formation and environment comes from the work of  @xcite who analyzed a sample of early - type systems in the low density regime ( field ) showing that these galaxies are younger and more metal - rich than their counterparts in clusters .",
    "most of these studies used samples of at most a few hundred galaxies .",
    "since these works are the nearby counterparts of the studies of the evolution of early - type galaxies ( etgs ) as a function of redshift in clusters ( e.g.  @xcite ) and in low - density environments  @xcite , it is necessary to establish large and well - defined samples covering a broad range of environments as we do here .",
    "this is the fourth paper of a series studying the global properties of etgs in the local universe ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we focus on stellar population gradients and how they depend on galaxy properties .",
    "we use optical data ( @xmath21 photometry and spectra ) from the sloan digital sky survey data release 6 ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and near - infrared photometry from the ukirt infrared deep sky survey data release four ( ukidss , * ? ? ?",
    "the selection of etgs is described in la barbera et al .",
    "( 2010a ; hereafter paper i ) , and we refer the reader to that paper for all the details on sample selection and the procedures used to derive the galaxy parameters .",
    "the results presented in this paper apply not only to ellipticals , but also to lenticular galaxies as well as those dominated by a red central bulge ( but see sec .",

    "10 we summarize our most important results . throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the sample of etgs is selected from sdss - dr6 , following the procedure described in la barbera et al .",
    "( 2008b ) , la barbera & de carvalho ( 2009 ) , and paper i. we select galaxies in the redshift range of 0.05 to 0.095 , with @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the k - corrected sdss petrosian magnitude in r - band .",
    "the k - correction is determined using the software @xmath27 ( version @xmath28 ;  @xcite ) , through a restframe r - band filter blue - shifted by a factor @xmath29 .",
    "we adopt @xmath30 as in ( e.g. )  @xcite .",
    "the lower redshift limit of the sample is chosen to minimize the aperture bias  @xcite , while the upper redshift limit guarantees not only a high level of completeness ( according to  @xcite ) , but also allows us to define a volume - limited sample of _ bright _ early - type systems . at the upper redshift limit of @xmath31 ,",
    "the magnitude cut of @xmath32 also corresponds approximately to the magnitude limit to which the sdss spectroscopy is complete ( i.e. a petrosian magnitude of @xmath33 ) .",
    "following  @xcite , we define etgs using the sdss spectroscopic parameter @xmath34 , which indicates the spectral type of a galaxy on the basis of a principal component analysis , and the sdss photometric parameter @xmath35 , which measures the fraction of the galaxy light that is better fitted by a de vaucouleurs ( rather than an exponential ) law",
    ". etgs are those systems with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we select only galaxies with central velocity dispersion , @xmath38 , available from sdss - dr6 , in the range of @xmath39 and @xmath40 kms@xmath41 , and with no spectroscopic warning on ( i.e. @xmath42 attribute set to zero ) .",
    "these constraints are chosen to select only reliable velocity dispersion measurements from sdss . applying the above criteria leads to a sample of @xmath43 etgs .    out of the @xmath43 etgs defining the spider sample",
    ", @xmath44 also have photometry in the @xmath45 wavebands from the ukidss - large area survey ( see  paper i ) .",
    "all galaxies have two measures of the central velocity dispersion , one from sdss - dr6 and an alternate estimate obtained by fitting sdss spectra with the starlight software  @xcite . in all wavebands , the structural parameters including effective radius , @xmath46 , the mean surface brightness within that radius , @xmath47 , and the sersic index , @xmath48 , have been homogeneously measured using 2dphot  @xcite .",
    "total magnitudes are computed from the effective parameters in each filter .    for this work ,",
    "we select etgs from the spider survey as follows .",
    "first , we exclude galaxies which are poorly fitted by a two - dimensional sersic model .",
    "this is done by selecting only objects with @xmath49 in all wavebands , where @xmath50 is the rms of residuals between the galaxy image in a given band and the corresponding best - fitting two - dimensional sersic model .",
    "the threshold @xmath51 excludes those objects which are more than 5  @xmath12 above the peak of the @xmath50 distribution in all passbands .",
    "as shown in  paper i , the distributions of @xmath50 in @xmath52 are peaked around one , with a width of @xmath53 .",
    "second , since we estimate the internal color gradients from @xmath46 and @xmath48 , we exclude galaxies with large uncertainties on these parameters .",
    "as shown in  paper i , the errors on @xmath48 are nearly independent of @xmath54 ratio , and are always less than @xmath53  dex . on the other hand , the errors on @xmath46 strongly depend on the @xmath54 .",
    "to remove galaxies with large uncertainties without overly reducing the sample size , we select only those etgs with a @xmath55 uncertainty less than @xmath56  dex in all wavebands .",
    "these restrictions yield a subsample of @xmath57 galaxies with parameters in @xmath21 . of these",
    ", @xmath58 objects also have photometry in @xmath45 .",
    "hereafter , we refer to these as the optical and optical+nir samples of etgs , respectively .",
    "we analyze the dependence of internal color gradients in etgs on galaxy parameters , i.e. structural parameters , optical and nir magnitudes , stellar and dynamical masses , and stellar population properties ( age , metallicity , and @xmath10-enhancement ) . the derivation of magnitudes and structural parameters is described in  paper i. below ,",
    "we describe the estimate of stellar and dynamical masses ( sec .",
    "[ sec : stellar_masses ] and  [ sec : dyn_masses ] ) , as well as that of the stellar population parameters ( sec .",
    "[ sec : stellar_pop ] ) .",
    "galaxy stellar masses can be estimated by fitting their observed seds with stellar population synthesis models .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that such techniques , combining optical and near - ir fluxes with spectroscopic redshifts , could be used to derive masses with a factor of two uncertainty to @xmath59 .",
    "local studies by @xcite and @xcite examined the stellar mass function using similar methods . @xcite",
    "have shown that galaxy properties derived from sed fitting with broadband colors are consistent with those derived from spectroscopic data .",
    "thus , we use sed fitting to derive galaxy stellar masses .",
    "we employ the lephare code ( s. arnouts & o. ilbert ) used by the cosmos survey @xcite to fit a suite of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bc03 ) model seds to our observed 8-band photometry and the known spectroscopic redshift .",
    "lephare performs a @xmath50 minimization between the observed fluxes ( and their associated errors ) and those synthesized from the models .",
    "because early - types are unlikely to have significant ongoing star formation , we use a simple set of @xcite seds , with 6 different star - formation e - folding times @xmath60 , 5 internal reddenings @xmath61 , and four metallicities @xmath62 , for a total of 120 possible models .",
    "the values of these parameters are given in tab .",
    "[ tab : sedmods ] .",
    "we assume a @xcite extinction law and @xcite initial mass function .",
    "the reddening e(b - v ) is limited to 0.5 magnitudes to avoid incorrect fitting of observationally red galaxies as highly reddened blue galaxies ; such objects should be absent from our sample .",
    "because each bc03 template is normalized to one solar mass , we use the observed @xmath63-band flux to determine the normalization of the best - fit template which then gives the stellar mass .",
    "we use @xmath63-band for the mass scaling since it is only weakly affected by dust extinction and is quite insensitive to the presence of young , luminous stars @xcite .",
    "c|c|c 1 & 0 & 0.2 + 2 & 0.1 & 0.4 + 3 & 0.2 & 1.0 + 5 & 0.3 & 3.0 + 10 & 0.4 & + 15 & 0.5 & + [ tab : sedmods ]    galaxy fluxes are estimated in an adaptive aperture of radius @xmath64 in all wavebands , where @xmath65 is the i - band kron radius ( see  paper i ) .",
    "we use these aperture fluxes as they have a better accuracy than those obtained from ( 2dphot ) total magnitudes . in order to derive total stellar masses , @xmath66",
    ", we apply an aperture correction .",
    "we calculate the fraction of total to @xmath67 aperture flux in k - band , and then multiply the estimated stellar mass by this fraction .",
    "this procedure assumes that stellar mass in a galaxy is distributed in the same way as the k - band light .",
    "rather than use an individual best - fitting sed ( based on the @xmath68 ) , we use a mass computed from the model corresponding to the median @xmath69 .",
    "this reduces stochastic mass errors due to individual models which happen to have very low @xmath68 values , since there remains some degeneracy in the sed fits even with 8 filters .",
    "a small number of galaxies ( 1465 of 39993 with optical data only , and 286 of 4546 with nir data ) are not well fit by any of the seds , resulting in @xmath70 and thus no stellar mass estimate .",
    "these objects , comprising 3.6% and 6.3% of the optical and optical+nir samples , respectively , are excluded from analyzes that require the stellar masses .",
    "we tested our stellar masses by comparing to those derived by a group at max plank using sdss photometry alone .",
    "the overall agreement is excellent .",
    "we find a modest offset in @xmath71 of 0.14 dex ; this is because we use kron magnitudes rather than fiber magnitudes ; kron magnitudes are @xmath72 mag brighter , which translates into a difference @xmath73 in @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath75 scatter between the two mass estimators is only 0.1 dex , a factor of @xmath76 smaller than most systematic errors and biases introduced by different choices of imf , extinction law , etc .",
    "more details of the sed fitting and potential sources of errors and biases in the stellar mass estimates will be presented in an upcoming paper in this series devoted to this issue alone  ( swindle et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "we note that both the sed fitting and the analysis of color gradients ( sec .",
    "[ sec : grads ] ) are performed with a different set of models ( i.e. bc03 ) than that used for the spectral analysis ( i.e. miles , see sec .  [",
    "sec : stellar_pop ] ) .",
    "the bc03 models provide a high resolution of 1  @xmath77 in the wavelength range 3322  @xmath77 to 9300  @xmath77 ( griz ) , with a median resolution of 10  @xmath77 in zyjhk .",
    "we do not use the miles library here as we do for other tests in this paper due to its limited wavelength coverage ( 3525  @xmath77 to 7500  @xmath77 ) . with 7500  @xmath77 lying near the central wavelength of the i - band , ignoring the izyjhk data inevitably yields failures in sed identification ,",
    "provided the range of model parameters given in tab .  1 .",
    "this uncertainty , coupled with the benefit of the k - band flux for mass - scaling , motivates this choice of models for the sed fitting . the technical justification for using the miles library in analyzing spectra and color gradients",
    "is also detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec : stellar_pop ] .",
    "dynamical masses , @xmath3 , are obtained from galaxy effective radii and velocity dispersions . applying the virial theorem , we write @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the effective radius in k - band , and @xmath80 is a scale factor that accounts for the internal structure of etgs .",
    "most previous works estimated @xmath80 by assuming a single universal model for the light distribution in etgs , such as the king model  @xcite .",
    "however , this does not account for the variety of etg light profile shapes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as parametrized by the sersic index . to account for this , following a similar procedure to that of  @xcite",
    ", we estimate @xmath80 using de - projected sersic galaxy models .",
    "the models and the de - projection procedure are detailed in  @xcite .",
    "the models describe spherical , non - rotating , isotropic galactic systems .",
    "we also assume that the spatial distribution of dark matter follows that of the stellar component . under these assumptions ,",
    "each model consists of a single sersic component characterized by three parameters : the half - mass radius , the total mass , and the sersic index ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "the use of more complex models ( i.e. those with two - components ) is well beyond the scope of this paper , and we postpone it to a forthcoming contribution . for each etg",
    ", we construct the corresponding sersic model , using the effective radius and sersic index of the galaxy in k - band .",
    "we estimate @xmath80 by computing the ratio of the quantities @xmath3 and @xmath81 for the given model .",
    "we compute @xmath38 by projecting the model in two - dimensions , within a circular aperture of radius @xmath82 , i.e. the same aperture as the sdss fibers .",
    "since we do not have k - band structural parameters for the optical sample of etgs , @xmath3 is only estimated for galaxies in the optical+nir sample .",
    "[ fig : mpetr_mdyn ] shows the dynamical masses versus the petrosian magnitudes , from which we see that our limiting magnitude corresponds to a lower mass limit of @xmath83 .",
    "as described in paper i , we have re - measured velocity dispersions for etgs in the spider sample using starlight  @xcite .",
    "this software determines the linear combination of simple stellar population ( ssp ) models which , broadened with a given @xmath12 , best matches the observed galaxy spectrum .",
    "hereafter , we refer to the set of ssp models provided as input to starlight as the ssp _ basis _ , and to the output linear combination of ssps as the synthetic spectrum . for the purpose of remeasuring the @xmath38 s , we run starlight with a _ basis _ of ssps from the miles galaxy spectral library ( vazdekis et al .",
    "2010 ) , covering a wide range of ages and metallicities , but with fixed solar abundance ratio ( [ @xmath10/fe]=0 ) .",
    "here we also use starlight to estimate the @xmath15 , @xmath84 $ ] , and @xmath8 $ ] of each etg .",
    "in contrast to the more common practice of using index - index diagrams to estimate ssp - equivalent stellar population parameters  , starlight uses all of the information present in the data , by fitting a set of ssp models to the entire galaxy spectrum .",
    "a detailed comparison of stellar population parameter estimates from different techniques for the spider sample is currently under way , and will be the subject of a forthcoming paper in this series . here , we provide only the essential information on how we use starlight to derive @xmath15 , @xmath84 $ ] , and @xmath8 $ ] . for each galaxy , we run starlight using the alpha - enhanced miles ( hereafter @xmath10-miles ) spectral library  ( cervantes et .",
    "al .  2007 ) .",
    "as detailed in app .",
    "[ app : miles ] , the @xmath10-miles library extends the miles galaxy spectral library to ssp models with non - solar abundance ratios , in the @xmath8 $ ] range of @xmath85 to @xmath86 , allowing the spectra of etgs to be modeled with better accuracy than that achieved with solar - abundance miles models .",
    "the @xmath10-miles seds cover the same spectral range ( @xmath87  ) , with the same spectral resolution ( 2.3  ) , as the ( solar abundance ) miles library .",
    "hence , they are well suited to analyzing sdss spectra , whose spectral resolution is @xmath11 2.36    fwhm , in the wavelength interval 4800 - 5350   . to run starlight , we select a _ basis _ of @xmath88 @xmath10-miles ssps , with ages ranging from @xmath89 to @xmath90",

    "for each galaxy , we first smooth the _ basis _ models to match the wavelength - dependent resolution of the sdss spectrum ( see paper i for details ) .",
