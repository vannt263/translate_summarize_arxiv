    "in many polymer / solvent systems , phase separation occurs at a lower critical solution temperature ( lcst ) @xcite . for temperatures smaller than the lcst",
    "the polymer is soluble while a miscibility gap opens above the lcst which is closed again at an upper critical solution temperature ( ucst ) .",
    "these lower critical solution temperatures are difficult to predict accurately from theory @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we employ a recently developed lattice model  @xcite based on the born - green - yvon ( bgy ) integral equation approach to fluids to investigate the miscibility of polyethylene in alkanes .",
    "the bgy lattice model provides a compact expression for the configurational part of the helmholtz free - energy density which allows the calculation of the relevant thermodynamic properties of a mixture .",
    "in addition to the system - dependent parameters of the pure components , the lattice model for a binary mixture contains an energy parameter describing interactions between unlike molecules . in this work",
    "the interaction energy is approximated by the geometric mean of the energy parameters of the pure components , allowing the thermodynamic properties of the mixture to be predicted from those of the pure components . in the following sections we describe how the bgy lattice model is used to predict the lcst s and corresponding coexistence curves for polyethylene in various alkanes , and then compare our results with experimental data .",
    "in the bgy lattice model , a molecule of species @xmath0 is assumed to occupy @xmath1 contiguous sites on a lattice having coordination number @xmath2 and a total of @xmath3 lattice sites . as in earlier work  @xcite",
    ", we set @xmath4 .",
    "the site - fraction @xmath5 is defined as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of molecules of component @xmath0 while @xmath8 is the fraction of empty sites or holes , where @xmath9 is the number of holes .",
    "each molecule of species @xmath0 has @xmath10 interaction sites , leading to the definition of concentration variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 which account for the nearest - neighbor connectivity of the molecules .",
    "the interaction energy associated with nonbonded nearest neighbors of the same species is @xmath13 , while @xmath14 corresponds to interactions between unlike nearest neighbor segments . using the born - green - yvon integral equation approach ,",
    "lipson @xcite derived an expression for the dimensionless configurational helmholtz free energy per lattice site @xmath15 of an @xmath16-component mixture @xmath17 -\\ln\\left[\\xi_{\\rm h}+\\sum_{j=1}^m \\xi_j \\exp(-\\beta\\epsilon_{ij})\\right ] \\right\\}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the temperature and @xmath20 is boltzmann s constant . denoting the total volume of the lattice by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the volume per site",
    ", we obtain the helmholtz free - energy density @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a caloric background which is not discussed further in this work .",
    "all thermodynamic properties of a mixture can now be derived from the thermodynamic relation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the internal energy of the system , and where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the number density and chemical potential of component @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the pressure @xmath31 and the chemical potentials @xmath32 , for example , are given by @xmath33 ,   \\mbox { \\hspace{3em } }   \\mu_i=\\frac{{\\displaystyle}r_i}{{\\displaystyle}\\beta } \\left(\\frac{{\\displaystyle}\\partial \\hat{a}}{{\\displaystyle}\\partial \\phi_i}\\right)_{\\beta,\\phi_{k\\neq i } } .\\ ] ]    it now becomes convenient to focus on molar quantities , so that @xmath34 becomes the molar density of component @xmath30 , @xmath22 denotes the volume of a mole of lattice sites , the energy parameters @xmath35 are measured in j / mol , and @xmath20 is replaced by the universal gas constant r.",
    "for the case of a one - component fluid , equations ( [ bgy1])([bgy4 ] ) are evaluated with @xmath36 , so that we can drop the subscripts other than h. there are three system - dependent parameters which we determine from a comparison with experimental data : the number @xmath37 of lattice sites occupied by a single molecule , the volume @xmath22 per mole of sites , and the interaction energy @xmath35 .    to obtain parameters for the @xmath38-alkanes from pentane through tridecane we considered coexistence densities .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath39 and the critical density @xmath40 of a one - component fluid are determined by the following two conditions : @xmath41 for temperatures @xmath19 smaller than @xmath39 the coexistence densities @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be found from the conditions that pressure and chemical potential are equal in the vapor and the liquid phase , i.e.@xmath44 we determined the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath22 , and @xmath35 for a number of @xmath38-alkanes between methane and octane by comparing calculated liquid and vapor densities for temperatures between @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( to avoid the critical region ) with values tabulated by vargaftik  @xcite .",
    "we then correlated the parameters with the chain length @xmath38 of the alkanes , where we typically excluded the results for the lowest alkanes .",
    "the resulting expressions for the parameters as a function of chain length are given by @xmath47 the first of these equations , eq .",
    "( [ pure3 ] ) , reflects the fact that the hard core volume of the alkanes is expected to grow linearly with chain length , while eq .",
    "( [ pure4 ] ) conveys a linear relationship between the interaction energy per mole and the chain length @xmath38 . due to end effects ,",
    "neither relation is expected to hold for very small @xmath38 .",
    "the last equation , eq .",
    "( [ pure5 ] ) , is motivated by the variation of the experimental  @xcite and calculated critical temperatures of the alkanes with chain length . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we present the values of the system - dependent parameters for pentane through tridecane according to eqs .",
    "( [ pure3])([pure5 ] ) . calculated values for the coexistence densities of hexane along with values from ref .",
    "@xcite are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , while percent deviations between calculated and tabulated values for all alkanes considered in this work are presented in fig .",
    "the highest deviations seen in fig",
    ".  [ fig2 ] are for vapor densities and are , in part , a result of the correlation of the parameters with chain length .",
    "the two figures show that our model gives a reasonable description of the coexistence densities outside the critical region .",
    ".system - dependent parameters for the pure components .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"<,>,<,>,<,>,<,>,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     system - dependent parameters for polyethylene ( pe ) were determined from a comparison with experimental pvt data @xcite in the liquid region for temperatures between 420k and 560k and pressures between 10mpa and 200mpa . when the density of a long chain polymer is given as a mass density , rather than a number density",
    ", the pressure is expected to be independent of the molecular mass  @xcite of the polymer .",
    "we determined system - dependent parameters for pe from a comparison between experimental and calculated pressures using three different molecular masses for the polymer .",
    "the representation of the experimental data was virtually identical in the three cases . and",
    "the resulting values for the parameters , as presented in table  [ tab1 ] , show that for long chain polymers @xmath35 and @xmath22 are indeed independent of the molecular mass , while @xmath37 is proportional to it . a comparison between calculated and experimental values for the density at given temperature and pressure is presented in fig  [ fig3 ]",
    ". the deviations are generally smaller than 0.3% but reach up to 1% for the lowest pressures .",
    "to discuss phase separation in binary mixtures , it is convenient to introduce the total molar density @xmath48 and the mole fraction @xmath49 of component 2 .",
    "the thermodynamic field conjugate to the mole fraction @xmath50 is the difference of the chemical potentials @xmath51 . in terms of these variables ,",
    "the conditions for a point @xmath39 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 on the critical line of a binary mixture take the form  @xcite : @xmath54 the first of the two equations defines the spinodal while the second one implies that , for given pressure , the critical point is an extremum of the spinodal in the @xmath19-@xmath50 plane .",
    "hence , lower and upper critical solution temperatures ( lcst s and ucst s ) correspond to the minimum and maximum of their spinodals , respectively . for temperatures",
    "@xmath55 , the mixture phase separates into two phases of different mole fractions @xmath56 and @xmath57 . for a given pressure @xmath31 ,",
    "the coexisting phases satisfy @xmath58 for typical solutions of polymers in alkanes , the mole fractions @xmath50 are very small numbers so that it is more convenient to employ mass fractions @xmath59 : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the molecular masses of component 1 and 2 , respectively .    when the bgy lattice model is applied to binary mixtures , eqns .",
    "( [ bgy1])([bgy4 ] ) are evaluated with @xmath63 .",
    "the total molar density @xmath48 and the mole fraction @xmath49 of the mixture are related to the site fractions @xmath64 and @xmath65 by @xmath66 in addition to the energy parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and the numbers of segments @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which are determined directly by the pure components of the mixture , values need to be supplied for the interaction energy @xmath71 and the volume @xmath22 of a mole of lattice sites . for the energy parameter @xmath71",
    "we employ berthelot s geometrical mean combining rule  @xcite : @xmath72 to find a value for @xmath22 , we take advantage of the fact that the bgy model for the pure polymer depends more strongly on the product @xmath73 than on the values of the number of segments @xmath37 and the volume @xmath22 separately . hence , for a mixture of an alkane and polyethylene , we assign the value @xmath74 of the alkane to the mixture , and rescale the segment length of the polymer , i.e.@xmath75 when parameters @xmath22 and @xmath70 , given by eq .",
    "( [ lcst7 ] ) , are used to compare experimental and calculated @xmath76 data for pure polyethylene over the whole temperature and pressure range , it is seen that the new parameters diminish the overall agreement between experiment and theory .",
    "however , for the lowest pressures the description of the @xmath76 surface is improved over that using the original parameters , and becomes excellent for the highest alkanes .",
    "this is important since we are going to investigate phase separation of polyethylene solutions at _ atmospheric _ pressure .",
    "to determine the lower critical solution temperatures for mixtures of polyethylene and the various alkanes discussed in the previous section , we employed the parameters presented in table  [ tab1 ] , where the highest molecular - mass parameters were used for polyethylene , together with eqs .",
    "( [ lcst6 ] ) and ( [ lcst7 ] ) .",
    "we then solved eqn .",
    "( [ lcst2 ] ) numerically to find the spinodal curve for atmospheric pressure @xmath77mpa .",
    "the lcst was identified as the minimum of the spinodal curve as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "all calculated lcst s are included in table  [ tab1 ] , and the values for the @xmath38-alkanes between pentane and tridecane are compared with experimental values  @xcite in fig .",
    "these results show that while the bgy lattice model with the parameters of table  [ tab1 ] somewhat underestimates the lcst s for the shorter chains , it gives a very good description of the data for the higher alkanes .",
    "the influence of the chain length of the polymer on its solubility is illustrated in fig  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the symbols indicate experimental data by kodama and swinton  @xcite for three polyethylene samples of different molecular masses in decane .",
    "we calculated the coexistence curves for polyethylene in decane for three comparable molecular masses ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) using the coexistence conditions eqs .",
    "( [ lcst4 ] ) . shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig5 ] , as a function of the mass fraction @xmath59 , are the differences between the coexistence temperatures and the calculated and experimental values of the lcst of the longest chain , respectively .",
    "since the experimental data in the paper by kodama and swinton  @xcite were not tabulated but presented in a graph the comparison is not exact .",
    "it appears , however , that the effect of changing molecular mass on the coexistence temperatures of polyethylene in decane is predicted well by the bgy lattice model .",
    "with the aid of the system - dependent parameters for the pure components as well as the geometric mean approximation for the interaction energy , the bgy lattice model has been shown to predict lcst s for solutions of polyethylene in alkanes in very good agreement with experimental data .",
    "the theory also captures the effect of changing polymer molecular mass on solubility . in current work",
    ", we are investigating the influence on miscibility of polymer and solvent architecture .",
