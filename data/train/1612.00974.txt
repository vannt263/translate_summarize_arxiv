    "the theory of general relativity ( gr ) has been studied for over 100 years , but yet it fails to fully explain what the cause of the accelerated expansion of the universe is @xcite .",
    "one of the prominent models used is the dark energy model which attempts to explain the late - time acceleration as a result of a kind of energy related to the cosmological constant .",
    "alternative models and theories have tried to explain this phenomenon in the context of curvature , such as @xmath4 gravity , modified gauss - bonnet gravity @xmath5 and with a general coupling between the ricci scalar and the gauss - bonnet terms in @xmath6 gravity ( see an extensive review on the cosmological implications in refs . @xcite and references therein ) , and also via a coupling between matter and curvature through @xmath7 gravity , where @xmath1 is the trace of the stress - energy tensor @xcite , among other approaches @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been an increase of interest in a different type of alternative theory of gravity , one which does not use curvature but uses torsion instead , which is called teleparallel gravity @xcite .",
    "this makes use of a different connection to the christoffel symbol , called the weitzenbck connection , which is a curvature - free quantity ( which contrasts the levi - civita connection , used in curvature based models , which is a torsion - free quantity ) and vierbein fields instead of a metric field . from this ,",
    "torsion based quantities can be derived , most notably the torsion scalar @xmath1 ( not to be confused with the trace of the stress - energy tensor ) , which can be used to explain gravity in terms of torsion .",
    "thus , this torsion scalar replaces the idea of the ricci scalar @xmath8 .",
    "it was shown that the torsion formalism is equivalent to that of gr , called teleparallel equivalent general relativity ( tegr ) , up to a boundary term difference @xcite . however , there are some subtle differences , such as having force - field equations analogues to those from electromagnetism instead of a geodesic equation , which allows the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) to be violated , something which in gr is not possible @xcite .",
    "as gr was generalised to @xmath4 gravity , teleparallel gravity was generalised to @xmath9 gravity .",
    "some interesting implications were discovered , such as allowing violations in the local lorentz transformations ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , recently it has been shown that local lorentz invariance can be restored making the theory to be covariant as those in curvature models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to @xmath4 gravity , the resulting field equations remain second order ( in contrast to fourth order theories ) , making the field equations simpler to work with .",
    "thus , although gr and tegr are equivalent ways in describing gravity , @xmath4 and @xmath9 gravity models are fundamentally different , resulting in a new way to investigate the cosmological implications of such a theory @xcite . nonetheless , various investigations in @xmath9 gravity have been applied within the realm of cosmology , including thermodynamics ref .",

    "@xcite ; for a detailed review on @xmath9 gravity , see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .    in a similar way to what was done to @xmath7 gravity ( where here @xmath1 is the trace of the stress - energy tensor ) , @xmath9 gravity",
    "can then be generalised into @xmath0 gravity , where @xmath2 is the trace of the stress energy tensor .",
    "the study of cosmological solutions in this theory has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as the aspect of reconstruction , thermodynamics and stability in ref .",
    "it is also possible to investigate the introduction of the trace of the stress - energy tensor for non - linear couplings in curvature based gravity , say @xmath10 gravity , which has been recently proposed in ref .",
    "however , given the simplicity of the resulting field equations in the torsional perspective ( of that being second order ) , it is much more reasonable to investigate the coupling between gravitation and matter through torsion rather than curvature ( since the resulting field equations would be fourth order ) .",
    "this torsion and matter coupling further opens possibilities to describe what the nature of dark energy is , or more precisely what is causing the observed acceleration .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the implications of such a theory in the realm of the growth evolution of the inhomogeneities of the universe during late times .",
    "this was originally considered by mszros for gr in 1974 @xcite , and the perturbed equation is sometimes referred to as mszros equation or mszros effect @xcite .",
    "this effect was investigated in various alternative and modified theories , including @xmath4 refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath9 gravity refs .",
    "@xcite , and in holographic @xmath9 gravity @xcite , yielding possible physical results when compared with @xmath11cdm models .",
    "given the recent volume of work in the torsional description of gravity , we are interested in finding out what happens to the mszros effect in the @xmath0 theory of gravity . in the case where @xmath2 is introduced in @xmath7 gravity ,",
    "this was investigated by alvarenga _ et .",
    "@xcite , and the growth factor was found to be dependent on the sub - horizon mode , which contrasts with what one obtains in gr and observational data . this puts in question the possibility of having such a theory as a possible candidate to explain late - time acceleration .",
    "thus , we investigate whether such a result is also observed for @xmath0 gravity .    the paper is divided as follows . a brief overview of teleparallelism and @xmath0 gravity is given in sec .",
    "ii , followed by the derivation of the modified mszros equation for the inhomogeneous universes in sec .",
    "afterwards , some solutions and also potential ansatz functions of the continuity equation are discussed in sec .",
    "iv . using these solutions , in sec .",
    "v , numerical results for the growth factor are analysed .",
    "finally , a conclusion about the results is given in sec .",
    "in order to obtain a torsion based theory , one requires a new connection , the weitzenbck connection @xmath12 , which is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are referred to as vierbeins ( or tetrads ) along with their respective inverses , and @xmath16 is called the _ purely inertial spin connection _ which is related to the inertial effects of the system under consideration @xcite . here",
    ", the latin indices transform like a flat space coordinate , while the greek indices transform like global coordinates . in this way",
    ", these vierbeins can be used to relate to the metric tensor @xmath17 depending on the local position @xmath18 on the spacetime manifold by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the minkowski metric tensor diag@xmath21 . in this way , the vierbein offer a way to connect the local minkowski metric to the global metric tensor . from this point",
    "onward , the explicit expression of a local position @xmath18 will be suppressed . using this connection ,",
    "the _ torsion tensor _ can be defined as @xmath22 the difference between the weitzenbck and levi - civita connections is expressed by the contorsion tensor @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the levi - civita connection .",
    "the contorsion tensor can also be expressed in terms of the torsion tensor as @xmath26 in this way , the superpotential tensor can be defined as @xmath27 using eq . and leads to the torsion scalar @xmath28 which defines the action for teleparallel gravity to be @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the matter lagrangian .",
    "as is done in gr , the torsion scalar in the action can be generalised to become a general function of both the torsion scalar and the trace of the energy momentum tensor @xmath2 , which results in @xmath32 + \\int d^4x \\ : e \\ : \\mathcal{l}_m,\\ ] ] where @xmath0 represents the generalised function .",
    "this is the analogue of @xmath7 gravity where @xmath1 is the trace of energy of the momentum tensor . by varying the action with respect to the inverse vierbein field @xmath33 ( analogous to taking variations with the inverse metric tensor @xmath34 in the metric formalism in @xmath4 gravity ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the following field equations field equations are obtained    @xmath35 + \\left(f_{tt } \\partial_\\sigma t + f_{t\\mathcal{t } } \\partial_\\sigma \\mathcal{t}\\right){s_{a}^{\\phantom{a}\\rho\\sigma } } + { e_{a}^{\\phantom{a}\\rho } } \\left(\\dfrac{t + f}{4}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\dfrac{f_\\mathcal{t}}{2 } \\left(\\stackrel{\\textbf{em}}{{t_{a}^{\\phantom{a}\\rho } } } + p{e_{a}^{\\phantom{a}\\rho}}\\right ) = 4\\pi g \\stackrel{\\textbf{em}}{{t_{a}^{\\phantom{a}\\rho}}}. \\label{eq : general - field - equations}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 is the stress - energy tensor , which in terms of the matter lagrangian is given by @xmath37 ( the full details of the derivation is given in appendix i ) . in the case where the spin connection is zero ,",
    "the field equations reduce to those found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the field equations listed in refs .",
    "@xcite are derived within the pure vierbein formalism ( the only dynamic variable is the vierbein ) where the purely inertial spin connection , @xmath38 , is assumed to vanish in all frames .",
    "this formulation results in having a breaking of the local lorentz symmetry for @xmath39 @xcite due to previous assumption .",
    "this led to formulations of what are called good and bad tetrads ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "recently , krk and saridakis show that this local lorentz invariance problem can be solved by allowing a non - zero purely inertial spin connection , i.e. by taking the covariant formulation of the theory @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , one can choose vierbeins which make the purely inertial spin connection vanish and still allow for local lorentz invariance in this theory ( such vierbeins are called proper vierbeins ) , whilst reducing the field equations to the standard pure vierbein ones .",
    "the vierbein considered in this paper is such type of vierbein and hence the field equations reduce to those in refs . @xcite and will still be local lorentz invariant .",
    "however , if a non - proper vierbein is chosen , one first requires to find the spin connection before deriving the field equations , which due to covariance , will be identical .",
    "one can analyse some basic properties of the field equations by considering a spatially flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the scale factor in terms of cosmic time .",
    "for such a metric , a diagonal vierbein field of the form @xmath42 is considered . in this case , @xmath43 . using the field equations in eq . , this gives rise to the two gr modified equations @xmath44 these equations can be rearranged into a more familiar form @xmath45 thus , by analysing the equations , one can define an effective dark energy ( de ) pressure @xmath46 and energy density @xmath47 as follows @xmath48 which in turn can be used to define an effective equation of state parameter @xmath49 to be note that this expression only makes sense given the provision that the denominator is non - zero . in this way",
    ", the effective equations become more familiar to the gr counterpart @xmath50 together , they give rise to a modified continuity equation @xmath51 assuming that an equation of state for the matter pressure and density with equation of state parameter @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath53 , the continuity equation reduces to @xmath54.\\ ] ]    at this point , one finds a coupling relation between the matter energy density and the effective de energy density . in other words , this implies that the stress - energy tensor is not divergence free @xcite .",
    "this occurs due to the matter and torsion coupling in the gravitational lagrangian .",
    "in fact , removing such coupling restores the divergence free property in @xmath9 gravity @xcite .",
    "other theories also result in such lack of divergence free property , for example @xmath55 gravity ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath56 theories @xcite , where the coupling of matter and curvature is the cause of such divergencelessness . having",
    "this not divergence free means that the standard gr continuity equation does not hold , and the matter evolution is influenced by this coupling .",
    "this influences standard fluid evolutions ( e.g. photons energy density would necessarily evolve as @xmath57 ) , which are well defined from maxwell - boltzmann statistics @xcite .",
    "thus , this seemingly results into contradictions .",
    "however , this shortcoming can be resolved by choosing the right @xmath58 function which results into the stress - energy tensor to be truly divergenceless .",
    "this concept , formulated and used in ref .",
    "@xcite , allows to determine some of such possible functions . in this way",
    ", the lagrangian is restricted . however , the full details of this approach are given in section iv , where such solutions are extracted .",
    "in the subsequent sections however , this condition is not assumed to allow for generality .    for the time being , let us consider the particular case in which this effective dark energy fluid becomes an effective cosmological constant , i.e. one which requires the condition that @xmath59 . in other words , the following condition must be satisfied @xmath60 by rearranging eq . , the following expression is obtained @xmath61 which when combined with eq .",
    ", the following relation is obtained @xmath62 where the equation of state and the torsion scalar @xmath43 have been used .",
    "one can note the dependence on @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the equations , the former being dependent on the continuity equation whilst the latter can be expressed in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath63 depends also on @xmath65 and @xmath47 , one has to use the definition of this effective dark energy and combine with eq . to create a differential equation in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "only [ the @xmath66 terms can be expressed in terms of @xmath2 by @xmath67 , except for the case @xmath68 .",
    "this serves as a way to form a relation which gives rise to possible solutions of @xmath58 which effectively have the same effect as a cosmological constant .",
    "however , one can note one clear solution which is when @xmath58 is a constant , which results in the standard @xmath11cdm model .",
    "in order to analyse the evolution of the inhomogeneities of the universe , we shall consider the standard scalar perturbed flrw metric ( up to first order ) , which is of the form @xcite @xmath69 for some scalar functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 . since the metric is generated by a vierbein field , one has to choose such a field which generates the above metric .",
    "one trivial choice would be @xmath72 as it is argued in zheng and huang s paper ref .",
    "@xcite , in the case of @xmath9 gravity , this results in compatibility issues with the integrated sachs - wolfe effect . for this reason , they proposed a non - diagonal vierbein field of the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 where @xmath52 and @xmath77 are two degrees of freedom of mass dimension and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are parity - violating terms . using this vierbein ,",
    "the following metric tensor is obtained    to obtain the flrw metric , a newtonian gauge is considered , being @xmath80 and @xmath81 . having the vierbein field set , one can obtain the field equations from eq . .",
    "for more details about the quantities being considered , see appendix ii , where the veirbein field , superpotential and torsion tensors , torsion scalar and stress - energy tensor are all defined .",

    "the main result of the paper is the modified mszros equation for @xmath0 gravity eq . .",

    "however , it was found that the gr limit of this modified mszros equation is still dependent on @xmath120 due to the presence of the anisotropic term @xmath3 .",
    "thus , this proposes two options : either this term vanishes ( i.e. @xmath269 or the anisotropy is a function of the wave number such that its effect does not cause non - physical results ( for example @xmath270 with @xmath271 ) .    even though such a scenario might exist",

    "@xmath58 here is of zero order , this can not be dependent on @xmath120 , leading to problems .",
    "in fact , for @xmath85 models , the growths found for the two functions considered provided non - physical results ( either oscillatory or with varying growths which eventually deviate greatly from @xmath11cdm ) .",
    "thus , two possible solutions were considered , the first being a constant @xmath58 .",
    "this case would lead to standard @xmath9-@xmath11cdm models ( provided that the effect of @xmath3 is negligible ) , which is not of interest here .",
    "thus , the second non - trivial case is considered , where the sum of this term and anisotropic term becomes zero .    for this scenario ,",
    "a coupling between the anisotropic term and the integration constants of the functions considered were found .",
    "this led to different evolutions , independent of @xmath120 , in which some of them being close to the @xmath11cdm growth .",
    "even though this might seem as a possible solution , one has to keep in mind that this sets a very specific form of how @xmath3 behaves , which can be unrealistic .",
    "the terms in the modified mszros equation have to cancel exactly , otherwise this would leave a @xmath120 dependence , which further strengthens this unrealistic possibility .",
    "nonetheless , this leaves an avenue for further investigation .",
    "this leaves @xmath0 models being unable to explain growth evolution ( except for cosmological constant models ) , unless the nature of the anisotropic term can be given very specific values .",
