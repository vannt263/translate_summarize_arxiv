    "be / x - ray binaries are the most common type of accreting x - ray pulsar systems .",
    "they consist of a pulsar and a be ( or oe ) star , a main sequence star of spectral type b ( or o ) that shows balmer emission lines ( see e.g. , slettebak 1988 and apparao 1994 for reviews . )",
    "the line emission is believed to be associated with an equatorial outflow of material expelled from the rapidly rotating be star that probably forms a quasi - keplerian disk near the be star @xcite .",
    "x - ray outbursts are produced when the pulsar interacts with this disk .",
    "be / x - ray binaries typically show two types of outburst behavior : ( a ) giant outbursts ( or type ii ) , characterized by high luminosities ( @xmath1 ergs s@xmath2 ) and high spin - up rates ( i.e. , a significant increase in pulse frequency ) and ( b ) normal outbursts ( or type i ) , characterized by lower luminosities ( @xmath3 ergs s@xmath2 ) , low spin - up rates ( if any ) , and recurrence at the orbital period @xcite . as a population",

    "exo 2030 + 375 is a 42-second transient accreting x - ray pulsar discovered during a giant outburst in 1985 with _",
    "optical and infrared observations of the _ exosat _ error circle identified a b0 ve star as the most likely companion @xcite .",
    "the initial outburst was first detected at a 1 - 20 kev luminosity of @xmath4 ergs s@xmath2   ( using a distance of 5 kpc assumed by parmar et al .",
    "1989 ) on 1985 may 18 and declined to @xmath5 ergs s@xmath2  by 1985 august 25 . during this luminosity decline ,",
    "the intrinsic spin period changed dramatically , with a characteristic spin - up timescale @xmath6 yr @xcite .",
    "this large intrinsic spin - up suggested that an accretion disk was present and made determination of an orbit difficult , resulting in 3 acceptable orbits .",
    "the rate of change of pulse period @xmath7 @xcite , the energy spectrum @xcite and the 1 - 10 kev pulse profile @xcite all showed significant luminosity dependence .",
    "further evidence of an accretion disk resulted from the detection of 0.2 hz quasi - periodic oscillations @xcite consistent with the magnetospheric beat frequency model @xcite and the keplerian frequency model @xcite . a second outburst , roughly a factor of 10 weaker in luminosity than the first , was also detected with _ exosat _ in 1985 october 28-november 3 @xcite .",
    "this outburst was apparently a normal outburst , but it showed unusual flaring activity .",
    "these flares were detected on 1985 october 30 - 31 and had a 4 hour recurrence period @xcite .",
    "observations of exo 2030 + 375 were quite sparse for the next several years . _ ginga _ observed exo 2030 + 375 on 1989 october 29 - 31 and 1991 october 24 @xcite .",
    "pulsations were detected only in the 1989 observations , with an observed pulse period of 41.68202(8 ) s and an observed period derivative of @xmath8 s / s at mjd 47828.95 .",

    "the most extensive observations of exo 2030 + 375 were made with the large area detectors ( lads ) of the burst and transient source experiment ( * ? ? ? * batse ) on the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro)_. from launch in april 1991 until _ cgro _ was de - orbited in june 2000 , batse provided nearly continuous coverage of exo 2030 + 375 . during the interval 1992 february 8 - 1993 august 26 , 13 consecutive outbursts of exo 2030 + 375 were seen with peak luminosities of @xmath9 ergs s@xmath2  ( see stollberg et al .",

    "outbursts were detected with batse , separated by 46 days @xcite .",
    "these outbursts began about 5 days prior to periastron passage as predicted using the orbital model of @xcite .",
    "outbursts were also regularly detected with the all - sky monitor ( * ? ? ?",
    "* asm ) on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ beginning in 1996 march @xcite .",
    "an outburst of exo 2030 + 375 was observed from 1996 july 1 - 10 with the _ rxte _ proportional counter array ( * ? ? ?",
    "pulsations were detected throughout the observations .",
    "this outburst began about 5 days prior to periastron passage .",
    "the 2 - 10 kev pulse profile did not show significant intensity dependence .",
    "in fact , it was consistent with the 1 - 10 kev _ exosat _ profile observed at a similar luminosity @xcite .",

    "we will present an improved orbit determination for exo 2030 + 375 using batse , _ rxte _ , and _ exosat _ data . this improved orbit along with more sensitive search techniques has led to the detection of pulsations in 52 outbursts in 9 years of batse data , including several outbursts in the period 1993 august to 1996 april when the source was previously believed to be quiescent .",
    "evidence for 19 additional outbursts , including 10 missed with batse and 9 after _ cgro _ was de - orbited , was observed with the _ rxte _ asm , for a total of 71 outbursts observed out of 82 periastron passages from 1991 april to 2001 august .",
    "we show that our improved orbital parameters remove the two intervals of enhanced spin - up observed by @xcite in the initial _ exosat _ outburst , when they used the orbit of @xcite to correct the observed pulse periods .",
    "we also show evidence for a correlation between spin - up rate and flux in the batse data and compare it to that observed in the _ exosat _ data .",
    "we compare our x - ray results to optical and infrared observations and discuss evidence for a decline in the density of the be disk and its effects on the x - ray flux and pulsed frequency histories .",
    "we discuss evidence in both optical observations of h@xmath0 profiles and x - ray observations that suggests a global one - armed oscillation ( i.e. , a density perturbation ) was propagating in the be disk .",
    "lastly , we discuss our observations of exo 2030 + 375 in context of current models .",
    "in previous studies with batse @xcite , histories of pulse frequency and pulsed flux for known pulsars were generated using grid searches over a range of candidate frequencies .",
    "the best fit frequency was determined using the @xmath13 statistic @xcite .",
    "these studies were often limited to 1-day integrations by systematic effects . we have developed an  advanced \" pulsar search that reduces 3 systematic effects : ( 1 ) aperiodic noise from sources in the batse field of view , ( 2 ) earth occultations of bright sources during the folding interval , and ( 3 ) bright pulses from other pulsars in the batse field of view .",
    "this technique is described in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will summarize it here , highlighting the differences from previous techniques .",
    "the  advanced \" pulsar search technique consists of 3 steps ( 1 ) data selection and combination , ( 2 ) 20 - 50 kev pulse profile estimates , and ( 3 ) a grid search in frequency .",
    "first the batse discla channel 1 ( 20 - 50 kev , 1 s time resolution data ) were selected for which the source was visible , the high voltage was on , the spacecraft was outside the south atlantic anomaly , and no electron precipitation events or other anomalies were flagged by the batse mission operations team .",
    "the count rates were combined over the 4 lads viewing exo 2030 + 375 using weights optimized for an exponential energy spectrum , @xmath14 with temperature @xmath15 kev @xcite , and grouped into @xmath16 s segments .",
    "a segment length of 300 s was used because it included several pulse periods , but was short enough that the background was well - fitted by a quadratic model .",
    "the segment boundaries were chosen to avoid earth occultation steps from bright sources because these steps could produce spurious signals at high harmonics of the spacecraft orbital period which could overwhelm the real signal , especially for long period pulsars . in the technique previously used by @xcite and @xcite potentially bright sources were input manually , which worked well for persistently bright sources , e.g. , crab or cygnus x-1 , but not as well for transient sources .",
    "effects from bright transients were greatly reduced in our advanced monitor by maintaining a database that included which sources were active on a given day and what level they were active .",
    "depending upon the pulse period of the source , i.e. , which spacecraft harmonic it was closest to , we automatically determined which occultation steps should avoided in the selection of segment boundaries .    the second step in this process was estimation of an initial 20 - 50 kev pulse profile for each segment . in each segment , the combined rates were fitted with a model consisting of a sixth - order fourier expansion in pulse phase model ( representing the 20 - 50 kev pulse profile ) and a spline function with quadratics in time ( representing the background plus mean source count rate ) .",
    "a sixth - order fourier expansion was chosen based on the number of harmonics that are significant in a 1-day observation .",
    "our initial pulse phase model was of the form @xmath17 , where @xmath18 mhz was a constant barycentric frequency and @xmath19 was the emission time corrected to the pulsar reference frame using the jpl de-200 ephemeris @xcite and the orbital parameters from @xcite .",
    "the value and slope of the spline function were required to be continuous across adjacent segment boundaries , but not across data gaps",
    ".    the final step in our advanced pulsar search was a grid search in frequency using the set of typically several hundred estimated 20 - 50 kev pulse profiles from 4-day intervals of data .",
    "new exo 2030 + 375 pulse frequencies were determined from an initial grid search over 201 evenly spaced trial barycentric frequencies in the range 23.97925 - 24.00240 mhz .",
    "aperiodic noise from cygnus x-1 caused the variances on the fourier coefficients to be larger than expected for poisson statistics .",
    "in previous searches @xcite , this caused the @xmath13 statistic and batse s sensitivity to be dependent on the noise level since only the poisson level was assumed .",
    "@xcite attempted to account for aperiodic noise from cygnus x-1 using the average cygnus x-1 noise level from a single day ; however , the noise level from cygnus x-1 is highly variable @xcite .",
    "hence to better account for the aperiodic noise , its effect must be estimated for each frequency measurement . to correct the poisson variances on the fourier amplitudes at each harmonic where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the pulse frequency . ] for aperiodic noise in the power spectrum , we first computed the mean harmonic amplitudes , i.e. , mean 20 - 50 kev pulse profile , for each 4-day interval",
    ". then we computed the reduced @xmath22 of a fit for each harmonic in the mean 20 - 50 kev pulse profile , to those from the 300-s segments within each 4-day interval .",
    "the variances for each harmonic of the mean 20 - 50 kev pulse profile were then multiplied by this reduced @xmath22 . due to the large field - of - view of batse ,",
    "other pulsars are often also present when we are measuring exo 2030 + 375 .",
    "if we limit our statistic to use the first 3 harmonics where exo 2030 + 375 is the brightest , we reduce the chances of contamination of the search results from other pulsars that happen to have harmonics near the higher harmonics of exo 2030 + 375 .",
    "however , once we know the pulse frequency well and are no longer searching , these harmonics can be re - included to improve the resolution of features in the 20 - 50 kev pulse profile . a modified @xmath23 statistic , which we will call @xmath24 after @xcite ,",
    "was then computed which incorporated the corrected variances .",
    "the reduced @xmath22 used to correct the variances on the first 2 fourier amplitudes was @xmath25 for the extended intervals mjd 48361 - 48650 ( 1991 apr - 1992 jan ) , 49700 - 50000 ( 1994 dec - 1995 oct ) , 50400 - 50600 ( 1996 nov - 1997 jun ) , 50650 - 50950 ( 1997 jul - 1998 may ) , and several shorter intervals indicating increased noise from cygnus x-1 .",
    "the best - fit frequency for each 4-day interval was determined using the @xmath24 statistic .",
    "the root - mean - squared ( rms ) pulsed flux was then estimated from the best - fit 20 - 50 kev pulse profile as ( * ? ? ? * equation b9 ) @xmath26^{1/2}\\label{eqn : pflx}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the real and imaginary fourier coefficients for each harmonic .",
    "figure  [ fig : freqs ] , panels ( a ) and ( b ) , illustrate the sensitivity improvements in our new techniques . panel ( a ) shows the barycentered , orbit corrected pulse frequencies measured at 1-day intervals from @xcite plus a few later outbursts detected using a similar method . in that technique , systematic effects dominated statistical errors for exo 2030 + 375 , resulting in little improvement in sensitivity for 4-day intervals versus 1-day intervals .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the barycentered , orbit corrected pulse frequencies measured at 4-day intervals from our new search .",
    "accounting for systematic effects now allows us to combine 4-day intervals with near - statistic errors , resulting in considerable improvement in sensitivity .",
    "our new search revealed many more outbursts than had been previously detected , including several during the 2.5 year  quiescent \" interval @xcite 1993 august - 1996 april ( mjd 49225 - 50175 ) .",
    "however , there was considerable unexpected scatter in the pulse frequency measurements , starting during the so - called  quiescent \" interval .",
    "these outbursts were occurring at an earlier orbital phase than those used by @xcite to determine the orbit .",
    "we suspected that the scatter in the detected pulse frequencies might be produced by errors in the orbital parameters caused by coupling between the intrinsic spin variations of the pulsar with orbital effects .",
    "the different orbital phase of the later outbursts gave us more orbital coverage , improving our ability to decouple these effects .",
    "one outburst in 1996 july ( mjd 50265 - 50275 ) was also observed with the _ rxte _ pca @xcite .",
    "barycentered standard 1 ( 125 ms , no energy resolution ) data were fitted with a model consisting of a constant background plus a sixth - order fourier expansion in pulse phase model , creating an estimated 2 - 60 kev pulse profile for each pca observation .",
    "the pulsed phase model consisted of a constant barycentric frequency @xmath29 estimated from batse measurements and the orbital parameters of @xcite .",
    "the rms pulsed fluxes where computed using equation  [ eqn : pflx ] for each 2 - 60 kev profile .",
    "the 2 - 60 kev pulse profile with the brightest pulsed flux from mjd 50268.835 - 50268.867 ( 1996 july 4 ) was selected as the template profile .",
    "phase offsets to the constant frequency model were generated by cross - correlating the 2 - 60 kev pulse profiles from each observation with the template .",
    "initially we suspected an error in the orbital period , which would show up as an error in the projected epoch of periastron .",
    "to test this idea , we fitted the _",
    "pulse phases with a quadratic phase model and an orbit with the period fixed .",
    "the first and second rows in table  [ tab : orb ] list the @xcite and our orbital parameters , respectively .",
    "surprisingly , the epoch of periastron passage , @xmath30 , was consistent ( within 1 @xmath31 ) with the value from @xcite propagated to the epoch of the _ rxte _ observations . however , the eccentricity @xmath32 , the projected semi - major axis @xmath33 , and the periapse angle @xmath34 all shifted slightly , by @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath35 , respectively . although these shifts were small , when we reran the frequency search using the revised orbital parameters , the frequency history no longer showed unexpected scatter .    to better refine the orbital parameters , we generated pulse phase measurements at 1-day intervals using batse data for all outbursts detected in our initial search .",
    "table  [ tab : outbursts ] lists the dates of the outbursts we detected .",
    "following steps 1 and 2 of the advanced pulsar search ( see section  [ sec : afs ] ) , we generated estimated 20 - 50 kev pulse profiles for 300-s segments using a pulse phase model consisting of a constant barycentric frequency for each outburst .",
    "for each 1-day interval , we computed a mean 20 - 50 kev pulse profile with variances corrected for aperiodic noise using techniques described in section  [ sec : afs ] and @xcite . to better resolve features in the 20 - 50 kev pulse profiles ,",
    "we retained all 6 harmonics . phase offsets to the pulse phase model were generated by cross - correlating individual 20 - 50 kev pulse profiles with a template profile .",
    "the template profile was the best - fit 20 - 50 kev profile from the brightest 4-day interval ( mjd 49126 - 49130 , 1993 may 19 - 23 ) in our frequency search .",
    "pulsed fluxes in the 20 - 50 kev band were computed for each 1-day interval using equation  [ eqn : pflx ] .",
    "previous studies @xcite reported that the outburst observed in 1996 april ( mjd 50176 - 50183 ) occurred at an earlier orbital phase than the 13 outbursts used by @xcite to determine an orbit . comparing figures  [ fig : freqs ] and [ fig : goao ] ( described in detail in section  [ sec : flx ] ) , one sees that the outbursts where the pulse frequencies show additional scatter , mjd 50000 - 51000 ( 1995 oct - 1998 jul ) , are occurring at a much earlier orbital phase than the 13 outbursts ( mjd 48659 - 49228 , 1992 feb - 1993 aug ) used by @xcite to determine orbital parameters , suggesting that fitting these outbursts would result in improved orbital parameters .",

    "certainly the 1997 and 1998 profiles are much wider than the 1996 one ( all observed at similar resolutions with the same telescope ) , indicating the presence of material in the circumstellar disk moving at high velocities close to the be star .",

    "the relative size of the two peaks changes with a cycle of several years .",

    "in addition to the expected correlation between observed flux and spin - up rate in the giant outburst of exo 2030 + 375 , the batse data suggest a correlation is also present in the brighter normal outbursts of this system ( see figure  [ fig : fdotvsflux ] ) . until recently , normal outbursts were believed to be due to direct wind accretion from the be disk , so significant spin - up was not expected because wind accretion is not believed to be very efficient at transferring angular momentum @xcite .",
    "however , evidence for spin - up during normal outbursts has been observed in gs 0834430 @xcite , 2s 1417624 @xcite , 2s 1845024 @xcite , and previously in exo 2030 + 375 @xcite . in batse observations of 2s 1845024 , a correlation between the spin - up rate and the pulsed flux was also observed .",
    "the comparison of the batse and exosat data in figure  [ fig : fdotvsflux ] , despite an uncertain bolometric correction , shows that at the lower fluxes measured with batse the correlation falls off more rapidly than a power law .",
    "this suggests either that spin - down torques become important or perhaps that a disk forms during the outburst and we are averaging over periods of wind and disk accretion . the data are clearly inconsistent with the power law index of @xmath64 predicted from simple accretion theory , which does not consider spin - down torques .",
    "the @xcite model fitted by @xcite , which assumes an accretion disk is present , roughly follows the trend observed in the data ; however , the brightest _ exosat _ observations , which drive the fit , clearly deviate from the model .",
    "the observed flux is given by @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is a beaming factor .",
    "this beaming factor , which is typically assumed to be equal to one for simplicity , depends on the pattern of emitted radiation at the pulsar and can not be determined without modeling of the pulse profiles ( which is beyond the scope of this work ) . because large luminosity dependent 1 - 10 kev pulse profile variations were observed during the giant outburst @xcite",
    ", one would expect that the beaming factor was also changing with luminosity . to fit any of the discussed models ,",
    "the beaming factor must decrease with increasing luminosity .",
    "the spin - up rate and its correlation with pulsed flux during the earlier outbursts of exo 2030 + 375 observed with batse suggest an accretion disk may be present .",
    "a disk will form if the specific angular momentum of the material accreted from the be star s disk is comparable to the keplerian specific angular momentum at the magnetospheric radius .",
    "the specific angular momentum @xmath135 of the accreted material is given by @xmath136 assuming @xmath137 . here",
    "@xmath138 hz s@xmath2 is the spin - up rate , @xmath139 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath140 ergs s@xmath2  @xmath141 is the luminosity , and @xmath142 is the distance in units of 7.1 kiloparsecs .",
    "the spin - up rate and luminosity are outburst averaged values from a typical bright outburst observed with batse in 1992 february .",
    "the luminosity is estimated from batse pulsed flux of @xmath143 ergs @xmath12 s@xmath2  using a bolometric correction of @xmath144 ( see section  [ sec : torq ] ) , and a distance of 7.1 kpc ( see section  [ sec : oir ] ) .",
    "we have assumed typical pulsar parameters , listed in section  [ sec : xir ] . if @xmath145 , the keplerian specific angular momentum at the magnetospheric radius , a disk will form . once a disk has formed the specific angular momentum of accreting material",
    "is maintained near @xmath146 . at @xmath132 ( equation  [ eqn : cia ] ) , @xmath147 .",
    "hence @xmath146 can be expressed as a function of @xmath132 and @xmath148 , which is independent of the distance and magnetic field of the pulsar . @xmath149 in the previous section , using _",
    "rxte _ and _ exosat _ observations , we determined @xmath131 ergs @xmath12 s@xmath2  @xmath150 ergs @xmath12 s@xmath2 . with the estimated average bolometric flux of @xmath151 ergs @xmath12 s@xmath2  from the 1992 february outburst used in equation  [ eqn : ell ] ,",
    "this yields @xmath152 @xmath60 s@xmath2 , which is within an order of magnitude of @xmath153 @xmath60 s@xmath2 , suggesting a disk is likely present because considerable angular momentum is present in the system .",
    "if a disk forms during the outburst , our average values of @xmath154 and @xmath155 used in these calculations would include periods of wind accretion and periods of disk accretion , possibly explaining why @xmath156 rather than being a larger fraction .",
    "in contrast , for the wind - fed system vela x-1 where a disk is not expected to be present , @xmath157 hz s@xmath2 @xcite , @xmath158 ergs s@xmath2 , and @xmath159 g @xmath113 @xcite leading to @xmath160 @xmath60 s@xmath2 and @xmath161 @xmath60 s@xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath162 .",
    "although the direct wind accretion model has difficulty explaining evidence for an accretion disk during normal outbursts , the viscous decretion disk model @xcite provides a natural explanation . in this model , the inner edge of the be disk has a keplerian velocity .",
    "viscosity conducts material outwards , so that it moves in quasi - keplerian orbits with low radial velocities .",
    "the radial outflow is subsonic for the orbital sizes of all be / x - ray binaries with a known solution .",
    "this model successfully accounts for most observations of be disks @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that tidal interaction of the neutron star truncates the circumstellar be disk . in the disk , truncation occurs when the outward viscous torque is less than the inward resonant torque which truncates the disk at a resonant radius . because of the truncation , the be disk can not reach a steady state @xcite . according to the modeling of @xcite , the be disk in exo 2030 + 375",
    "is likely truncated at the 4:1 resonance radius , which is close to the radius of the critical lobe at periastron .",
    "if the truncation radius is close to or slightly beyond the critical lobe radius at periastron , material with high angular momentum will flow through the first lagrangian point to the neutron star , making formation of a transient accretion disk likely @xcite in a normal outburst .",
    "hence this model provides a reasonable explanation of the brighter outbursts .",
    "we propose the following scenario to explain the ir and x - ray observations .",
    "the be disk is truncated at a 4:1 resonance radius .",
    "following @xcite , there should be an outburst at every periastron unless the circumstellar disk disappears . around mjd 49000 ( sometime in 1993 ) ,",
    "a major structural change occurred in the be star s circumstellar disk .",
    "it became much less dense , as shown by the change in ir magnitudes and the h@xmath0 equivalent width .",
    "much less matter was available for accretion , and as a consequence , the x - ray flux dropped and the neutron star spin - up ended .",
    "at the same time , or shortly afterward , a density wave ( or global one - armed oscillation ) developed and began to precess , without interacting with the neutron star s orbit . around mjd 50000 ( late in 1995 ) , the density perturbation interacted with the neutron star s orbit , at a phase corresponding to about 3 days prior to periastron passage , producing an x - ray outburst peaked at that phase .",
    "this implies that the precession of the density perturbation was prograde , in the same sense as the neutron star s orbital motion .",
    "sometime after about mjd 50600 ( mid-1997 ) , the density perturbation lost contact with the neutron star s orbit , in a position symmetrical with respect to periastron , i.e. , about 3 days after periastron .",
    "this ended the fast migration of the outburst peaks in orbital phase .",
    "some slow migration may still be present in figure  [ fig : goao ] , which may eventually lead to the previous value of 6 days after periastron , after a complete precession period of the perturbed disk .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) , provided by nasa s goddard space flight center ( gsfc ) .",
    "_ rxte _ asm quick - look results were provided by the asm/__rxte _ _ teams at mit and at the gsfc sof and gof .",
    "we are grateful to the support staff of the telescopio carlos sanchez and the service programme of the isaac newton group for help obtaining much of the optical and ir data .",

    "<S> using batse and _ rxte _ observations from 1991 april to 2001 august we have detected 71 outbursts from 82 periastron passages of exo 2030 + 375 , a 42-second transient x - ray pulsar with a be star companion , including several outbursts from 1993 august to 1996 april when the source was previously believed to be quiescent . combining batse , _ rxte _ , and _ exosat _ data we have derived an improved orbital solution . applying this solution results in a smooth profile for the spin - up rate during the giant outburst and </S>",
    "<S> results in evidence for a correlation between the spin - up rate and observed flux in the brighter batse outbursts . </S>",
    "<S> infrared and h@xmath0 measurements show a decline in the density of the circumstellar disk around the be star . </S>",
    "<S> this decline is followed by a sudden drop in the x - ray flux and a turn - over from a spin - up trend to spin - down in the frequency history . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first be / x - ray binary which shows an extended interval , about 2.5 years , where the global trend is spin - down , but the outbursts continue . in 1995 the orbital phase of exo 2030 + 375 s outbursts shifted from peaking about 6 days after periastron to peaking before periastron . </S>",
    "<S> the outburst phase slowly recovered to peaking at about 2.5 days after periastron . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this shift in orbital phase followed by a slow recovery as evidence for a global one - armed oscillation propagating in the be disk . </S>",
    "<S> this is further supported by changes in the shape of the h@xmath0 profile which are commonly believed to be produced by a reconfiguration of the be disk . </S>",
    "<S> the truncated viscous decretion disk model provides an explanation for the long series of normal outbursts and the evidence for an accretion disk in the brighter normal outbursts . </S>",
    "<S> long - term multi - wavelength observations such as these clearly add considerably to our knowledge of be / x - ray binaries and the relationship between optical , infrared and x - ray observations . </S>"
