    "the bond valence sum is a microscopic characterization based on the nanometer - scale structural analysis of the ionic bonds .",
    "although a bulk observable such as thermoelectric power ( seebeck coefficient ) at room temperature has been proposed to estimate the hole concentration  @xcite , no macroscopic observables enable us to estimate the layer - selective hole concentration in the multi - layer systems .",
    "then , microscopic observables have been desired .",
    "the @xmath5-plane spin component of the plane - site @xmath0cu knight shift @xmath6 at room temperature was used to estimate the individual hole concentrations of the non - equivalent cuo@xmath1 planes in the multi - layer superconductors  @xcite .",
