    "it is a frequently occuring question in algebraic geometry , if an algebraic group action @xmath0 admits a categorical quotient , i.e. , a regular map @xmath1 that is universal with respect to @xmath2-invariant regular maps @xmath3 .",
    "for example , moduli functors are often corepresented by categorical quotients . in general , it is a difficult problem to decide whether a categorical quotient exists .",
    "some counterexamples for actions of the multiplicative group @xmath4 are presented in @xcite .",
    "as these examples show , difficulties already arise with subtorus actions on toric varieties .",
    "such actions have been investigated by several authors , mainly focusing on the much more restrictive concept of a good quotient , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the description of toric varieties in terms of rational fans relates the problem of constructing quotients to problems of combinatorial convexity .",
    "hence the class of toric varieties serves as a testing ground for more general ideas .",
    "now , let @xmath5 be a toric variety and let @xmath6 be a subtorus of the big torus of @xmath5 .",
    "our approach to categorical quotients for the induced action of @xmath6 on @xmath5 is to consider the problem in suitable subcategories .",
    "a first step is to construct a quotient in the category of toric varieties itself : in @xcite , we showed that there always exists a _",
    "toric quotient _",
    "@xmath7    this is a toric morphism that is universal with respect to @xmath6-invariant toric morphisms .",
    "the essential part of the proof is an explicit algorithm in terms of combinatorial data .",
    "the toric quotient is a canonical starting point for quotients in further categories . for example , in @xcite we gave an explicit method to decide by means of the toric quotient when a subtorus action on a quasiprojective toric variety admits a categorical quotient in the category of quasiprojective varieties .    in the present article",
    "we give a considerable generalization of the results of @xcite , namely we solve the analogous problem in the category of divisorial varieties .",
    "recall that an irreducible variety @xmath5 is called divisorial if every point @xmath8 has an affine neighbourhood of the form @xmath9 with an effective cartier divisor @xmath10 on @xmath5 , see e.g. @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ii.2.2 ) .",
    "the class of divisorial varieties contains the quasiprojective varieties as well as all @xmath11-factorial varieties .",
    "it has nice functorial properties , see @xcite , and moreover it often provides a natural framework to extend statements known to hold for quasiprojective varieties on the one hand and for smooth varieties on the other hand .    a connection to toric geometry is provided by the embedding results of @xcite : a variety is divisorial if and only if it admits a closed embedding into a smooth toric prevariety @xmath12 having an affine diagonal map @xmath13 .",
    "the equivariant version of this statement implies in particular that a toric variety is divisorial if and only if it has enough invariant effective cartier divisors in the sense of t.  kajiwara @xcite , see section  1 .",
    "now , given a divisorial toric variety @xmath5 and a subtorus @xmath6 of the big torus of @xmath5 , when does the action of @xmath6 on @xmath5 admit a categorical quotient in the category of divisorial varieties ?",
    "as mentioned , we start with the toric quotient @xmath14    a first problem is that in general the toric quotient space @xmath15 is not a divisorial variety . to deal with this effect , we construct a _",
    "toric divisorial reduction_. this is a toric morphism @xmath16 which is universal with respect to toric morphism to divisorial toric varieties .",
    "the question then is , how these toric constructions behave in the essentially larger category of arbitrary divisorial varieties .",
    "our main result gives the following answer , see corollary  [ divcatquot ] :    the action of @xmath6 on @xmath5 admits a categorical quotient in the category of divisorial varieties if and only if the composition @xmath17 is surjective .",
    "moreover , in the latter case , @xmath18 is the desired categorical quotient .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ section1 ] we discuss divisoriality in the context of @xmath2-varieties and provide some general statements used in the subsequent constructions .",
    "sections  [ section2 ] and  [ section3 ] are devoted to the construction of the toric divisorial reduction .",
    "this is done in the language of combinatorial convexity .",
    "the main tool are convex support maps extending the notion of a convex support function on a fan .    generalizing the corresponding well - known statement on projectivity and support functions , we show that divisoriality of a given toric variety is characterized by the existence of a strictly convex support map on its fan .",
    "moreover , we relate convex support maps to toric morphisms to divisorial toric varieties .",
    "this allows the construction of the toric divisorial reduction . finally , we present some examples in section  [ section3 ] .    in sections  [ section4 ] and  [ section5 ]",
    "we prepare the proof of the main results .",
    "the essential task is to reduce arbitrary @xmath6-invariant regular maps to @xmath6-invariant toric morphisms .",
    "this is done by the decomposition lemma presented in section  [ section5 ] : given an @xmath6-invariant regular map @xmath19 to a divisorial variety , we construct a decomposition @xmath20 with an @xmath6-invariant toric morphism @xmath21 followed by a rational map @xmath22 defined near @xmath23 .",
    "the ingredients for the proof of this decomposition lemma are the abovementioned embedding of @xmath24 into a certain smooth toric prevariety @xmath12 provided by  @xcite and the following lifting result , presented in section  [ section4 ] : there exist quasiaffine toric varieties @xmath25 and @xmath26 `` above '' @xmath5 and @xmath12 respectively such that the map @xmath27 admits a lifting @xmath28 .",
    "this basically reduces the decomposition problem to the case of quasiaffine toric varieties .    in section  [ section6 ]",
    "we give statements and proofs of the main results .",
    "finally , in section  [ section7 ] we formulate an open problem on categorical quotients for subtorus actions on toric varieties .",
    "throughout the whole article , we work over a fixed algebraically closed field @xmath29 . so a prevariety is a reduced irreducible scheme of finite type over @xmath29 , and a variety is a separated prevariety .",
    "we say that a prevariety @xmath5 is of _ affine intersection _ , if its diagonal morphism @xmath30 is affine .    as usual , when we speak of a @xmath2-(pre-)variety where @xmath2 is an algebraic group , we mean an algebraic ( pre-)variety @xmath5 together with a @xmath2-action given by a regular map @xmath0 .",
    "for the basic notions on toric varieties and prevarieties , we refer to  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we provide some general facts on group actions on divisorial varieties .",
    "following borelli @xcite , we call a prevariety @xmath5 _ divisorial _ if every point @xmath8 has an affine open neighbourhood of the form @xmath31 with an effective cartier divisor @xmath10 on @xmath5 .",

    "the analogous notion in the setting of prevarieties , i.e. for possibly non - separated @xmath5 and @xmath24 , is called a _ geometric prequotient_.    in the sequel , we shall make use of the following characterization of divisoriality in terms of geometric quotients and closed embeddings , see  ( * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath5 admits a closed embedding into a smooth toric prevariety of affine intersection .",

    "a first consequence is that divisorial varieties with torus actions always have many invariant effective cartier divisors . for a toric variety",
    "this means that it is divisorial if and only if it has _ enough invariant effective cartier divisors _ in the sense defined by t.  kajiwara , see @xcite .",

    "conversely , suppose that @xmath5 is divisorial .",

    "divisorial reduction_.    a candidate for such a reduction is constructed in two steps .",
    "first , recall from  @xcite that there is a toric quotient for the action of @xmath6 on @xmath5 , that means a toric morphism @xmath501 which is a categorical quotient for the action of @xmath6 on @xmath5 in the category of toric varieties . in a second step ,",
    "construct the toric divisorial reduction of the toric quotient space as described in section  [ section3 ] : @xmath502    [ hinvardivred ] for a toric variety @xmath5 , the following statements are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath5 admits an @xmath6-invariant divisorial reduction .",
    "the composition @xmath503 is surjective .",
    "moreover , if one of these statements holds , then @xmath18 is the @xmath6-invariant divisorial reduction .    applying this result to divisorial toric varieties @xmath5 , we obtain the following solution for the above quotient problem :    [ divcatquot ] the action of a subtorus @xmath6 on a divisorial toric variety @xmath5 admits a categorical quotient in the category of divisorial varieties if and only if the composition of @xmath504 and @xmath505 is a surjective map .",
    "a further special case of theorem  [ hinvardivred ] is the case of a trivial torus @xmath500 .",
    "here we obtain the following :    [ divredchar ] a toric variety admits a divisorial reduction if and only if its toric divisorial reduction is surjective .",
    "assume first that @xmath18 is surjective .",
    "we show that a given @xmath6-invariant regular map @xmath230 to a divisorial variety @xmath12 factors through @xmath18 .",
    "lemma  [ zerlegungssatz ] yields a decomposition @xmath20 with an @xmath6-invariant dominant toric morphism @xmath405 to a divisorial toric variety @xmath108 .    by the universal properties of @xmath33 and @xmath449 , the toric morphism @xmath21 has a factorization @xmath506 . by surjectivity of @xmath18 ,",
    "the map @xmath22 is defined on a neighbourhood of the image of @xmath439 .",
    "hence @xmath507 is the desired factorization .",
    "thus @xmath18 is the @xmath6-invariant divisorial reduction of @xmath5 .",
    "conversely , suppose that @xmath5 has an @xmath6-invariant divisorial reduction @xmath508 .",
    "since the normalization of a divisorial variety is again divisorial , we can conclude that @xmath24 is normal .",
    "moreover , the universal property of @xmath497 implies that @xmath284 is surjective , and that @xmath24 inherits a set - theoretical action of the big torus @xmath455 making @xmath284 equivariant .",
    "note that a priori it is not clear that this action is regular , so we can not treat @xmath24 as a toric variety .",
    "let @xmath509 .",
    "we shall compare the @xmath6-invariant divisorial reduction @xmath497 with the toric morphism @xmath510 .",
    "on the one hand , because of the universal property of @xmath284 , the map @xmath511 factors uniquely through @xmath284 .",
    "so there is a unique regular map @xmath512 with @xmath513 .    on the other hand , lemma  [ zerlegungssatz ] provides a decomposition @xmath514 with a dominant toric morphism @xmath515 to a divisorial toric variety @xmath108 and a rational map @xmath22 from @xmath108 to @xmath24 that is defined on the image of @xmath21 . by the universal properties of @xmath33 and @xmath449 , we have @xmath516 with a toric morphism @xmath517 .",
    "so we arrive at the following commutative diagram : @xmath518^{r } \\ar[d]_{q \\circ p }   & y \\ar[dl]|\\alpha \\\\   z \\ar[r]_{g ' } & x ' \\ar@{-->}[u]_{h } } \\ ] ]    note that @xmath519 is contained in the domain of definition of the rational map @xmath22 . since @xmath284 is surjective , we have @xmath520 and we obtain that @xmath22 is defined on @xmath521 .",
    "it follows that @xmath522 is the identity on @xmath24 .",
    "this shows that @xmath523 is injective .",
    "moreover , on the big torus of @xmath12 , the map @xmath524 is the identity .",
    "consequently @xmath512 is a birational injection . since @xmath12 is normal , zariski s main theorem",
    "tells us that @xmath523 is in fact an open embedding .",
    "since the image @xmath525 is invariant under the induced set - theoretical action of @xmath35 on @xmath24 , the map @xmath523 is an isomorphism . in particular",
    ", @xmath526 is surjective .",
    "we conclude this section with some examples .",
    "the above results in many situations give positive answers to the problem of existence of quotients . a typical case",
    "are toric varieties defined by fans with convex support :    [ convsupp1 ] let @xmath5 be a toric variety arising from a fan with convex support .",
    "then @xmath5 admits a divisorial reduction .",
    "let the toric divisorial reduction @xmath527 arise from a map @xmath528 of fans @xmath132 and @xmath214 .",
    "then @xmath529 is a convex cone in @xmath129 and @xmath530 .",
    "intersecting the cones of @xmath214 with @xmath123 , we obtain a further fan in @xmath129 , namely @xmath531    let @xmath413 be the associated toric variety .",
    "the identity map @xmath130 defines an affine toric morphism @xmath532 .",
    "in particular , @xmath413 is divisorial .",
    "moreover , @xmath528 is also a map of the fans @xmath132 and @xmath533 .",
    "the corresponding toric morphism @xmath534 is surjective because @xmath535 equals @xmath536 .",
    "consider the decomposition @xmath537^{q } \\ar[dr]_{q ' } & & x ' \\\\ & x '' \\ar[ur]_{g }   } \\,.\\ ] ] the universal property of the toric divisorial reduction implies that @xmath538 is an isomorphism .",
    "hence @xmath527 is surjective and the assertion follows from corollary  [ divredchar ] .",
    "let @xmath5 be a divisorial toric variety arising from a fan with convex support .",
    "then every subtorus action on @xmath5 admits a categorical quotient in the category of divisorial varieties .",
    "let the toric quotient @xmath539 arise from a map @xmath540 of fans @xmath132 and @xmath214 . by  (",
    "* remark  2.5 ) , each cone @xmath541 is generated by images @xmath542 of certain @xmath137",
    ". thus also @xmath214 has convex support and @xmath539 is surjective .",
    "so , corollaries  [ divcatquot ] and  [ convsupp1 ] give the claim .",
    "however , corollary  [ divcatquot ] also provides counterexamples to existence of quotients .",
    "there can be different reasons for nonsurjectivity of @xmath18 , as the following examples show :    for the toric variety @xmath5 described in example  [ nichtsurjtdr ] the toric divisorial reduction is not surjective .",
    "hence @xmath5 does not admit a divisorial reduction .",
    "moreover by cox s construction , see  @xcite , @xmath5 is a good quotient of an open subset @xmath543 by a five dimensional subtorus @xmath544 .",
    "so , the action of @xmath6 on @xmath36 admits no categorical quotient in the category of divisorial varieties .",
    "let @xmath132 be the fan in @xmath314 having the following maximal cones : @xmath545 the associated toric variety @xmath5 is an open toric subset of @xmath546 .",
    "define a projection @xmath547 by @xmath548    by  @xcite , the toric morphism @xmath549 defined by @xmath167 is the toric quotient for the action of the subtorus @xmath195 on @xmath5 . since @xmath33 is not surjective , the action of @xmath6 on @xmath5 has no categorical quotient in the category of divisorial varieties .",
    "in this article we have solved the problem of existence of categorical quotients for subtorus actions on toric varieties in the divisorial category . for the analogous question in the category of all algebraic varieties",
    "we have partial results .",
