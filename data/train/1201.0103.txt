    "the recent discovery of iron - based superconductors  @xcite was welcomed by the scientific community , because it was supposed to answer the still open questions regarding the pairing mechanism in high temperature superconductors .",
    "however the multiplicity of controversial experimental results suggests that a unique description of the superconducting properties is far from being reached . among the still debated fundamental topics , e. g. the order parameter symmetry,@xcite the nanoscopic coexistence of magnetism with superconductivity,@xcite the role of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in the pairing mechanism,@xcite one fixed point",
    "is represented by the study of the flux lines lattice ( fll).@xcite in fact , the study of the magnetic field ( @xmath10)-temperature ( @xmath11 ) phase diagram of iron - based superconductors have immediately attracted lot of interest owing to their extremely high upper critical fields,@xcite which in some cases reach values even larger than those of high @xmath6 superconductors .",
    "most of the theories aiming at describing the fll properties are based on a regular arrangement of vortices.@xcite however , in real crystals this is far from being the case , because crystal defects , such as dislocations or inclusions , usually act as pinning centers preventing the vortices from having a regular arrangement or from moving freely under the action of an electric current . since these dynamics lead to dissipative effects the study of the pinning potential is of major importance for the technological applications of superconductors . on the other hand ,",
    "the understanding of the different phases developing in the magnetic field - temperature phase diagram of a superconductor and the modelling of the different dynamical regimes give rise to fundamental questions .",
    "@xcite a technique which offers the possibility of studying the fll dynamics from a microscopic point of view is nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) . in the past years",
    "a fruitful study was performed in the cuprates  @xcite and showed that the linewidth and the spin - lattice relaxation times were effective markers of the vortex dynamics . moreover , these two quantities provide complementary information since the linewidth narrowing is sensitive to the magnetic field fluctuations along the direction of the external field , while the spin - lattice relaxation time is sensitive to the transverse fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , being the nuclei local probes they are sensitive to flux lines excitations at all wave - vectors ,  @xcite at variance with macroscopic techniques , as the ac susceptibility for example , which are sensitive just to the long wavelength excitations.@xcite    thanks to the works performed in the cuprates we know now that in very anisotropic superconductors vortices can be considered as independent two - dimensional isles called `` pancakes '' which undergo diffusive thermal motions.@xcite bearing this in mind , and looking at the structural similarities between cuprates and pnictides , some obvious questions arise : is it still possible to detect the vortices thermal dynamics in iron - pnictides with nmr ?",
    "what is the vortices structure in the new iron - based compounds ?",
    "are vortices 2d uncorrelated islands or rather three - dimensional structures ? in order to answer at least part of these open questions we performed an nmr study of the superconducting state of ba(fe@xmath12rh@xmath13)@xmath5as@xmath5 superconductor with x@xmath14 .",
    "we measured both the spin - lattice ( @xmath1 ) and spin - echo ( @xmath2 ) relaxation rates of the @xmath0as nuclei , together with the knight shift and the nmr linewidth , at two different field intensities ( 7 t and 3 t ) and orientations ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) .",
    "the study of these quantities evidences the presence of low - frequency dynamics that we interpreted in the light of fll motion and , accordingly , we derived a quantitative description of the vortex motions , namely the temperature dependence of the correlation time and of the pinning potential at different magnetic fields . in the present work",

    "as previously mentioned , here we will not discuss the normal state properties but rather we shall concentrate on the superconducting phase . let us first consider the behaviour of the spin - lattice relaxation rate which is characterized by a well defined peak for @xmath26 below @xmath6 . in passing , we note that in co - optimally doped compound ,  @xcite no peak was observed in @xmath1 , below @xmath6 . on the other hand laplace et _ al .",
    "_ ,  @xcite in a 6% co - doped bafe@xmath5as@xmath5 , found a peak in @xmath1 just below @xmath6 and an enhancement in @xmath25 at higher temperature due to spin density wave correlations .",
    "the peak we found below @xmath6 is not expected to be a hebel - slichter peak  @xcite since the majority of the experimental and theoretical results point towards an extended s@xmath54-wave pairing,@xcite where that feature is expected to be absent .",
    "furthermore if it was a coherence peak the data would be described , below @xmath6 , by @xmath55 with @xmath56 the superconducting gap . by fitting the data one obtains @xmath57 k @xmath58 , the value expected for the superconducting order parameter .",
    "@xcite finally , the striking suppression of the peak for @xmath9 can hardly be reconciled with the small anisotropy of the electron spin susceptibility found in those materials .",
    "hence that maximum in @xmath1 just below @xmath6 should not be associated with the electron spin dynamics but , given the similarities with the behavior found in hgba@xmath5cuo@xmath59  @xcite and yba@xmath5cu@xmath60o@xmath61  @xcite cuprates , it is tempting to associate @xmath1 peak to the fll dynamics .",
    "in order to analyze the experimental results one can start from the basic modelling of fll in strongly anisotropic superconductors :  @xcite the vortices enter the sample in form of quasi - two dimensional pancakes , lying in the feas planes .",
    "owing to the thermal excitations they move out of their equilibrium positions by means of random motions , which can be hindered by the pinning centers . differently from cuprates , which exhibit a very high anisotropic ratio @xmath62 , with @xmath63 and @xmath64 the in - plane and out of plane coherence lengths , the ba122 superconductors show @xmath652 - 4 varying with temperature .",
    "@xcite this suggests to describe the flux lines not as completely uncorrelated pancakes , but rather as a stack of correlated islands .",
    "still , since the estimated correlation length @xmath64 is of the order of the inter - layer distance @xmath66 ,  @xcite namely @xmath67  , feas planes can be considered as weakly coupled superconducting layers .",
    "accordingly , when @xmath28 the flux lines are preferentially trapped between the planes and the feas plane boundaries act as pinning centers , a well known effect in layered superconductors .",
    "these intrinsic pinning centers hinder the dynamics and yield the observed suppression in the @xmath1 peak for @xmath28 .    in order to understand the shift of the @xmath1 peak upon increasing @xmath10 we first recall that @xmath1 probes the spectral density @xmath68 at the nuclear larmor frequency @xmath69 , namely @xmath70    with @xmath71 the magnetic field component perpendicular to @xmath7 and @xmath72 rad / t the gyromagnetic ratio of the @xmath0as nucleus .",
    "then the field dependence of the peak in @xmath1 can be qualitatively understood by considering that at the peak temperature the characteristic frequency for fll motions is close to @xmath69 .",
    "when the magnetic field increases , @xmath73 decreases and so does @xmath74 , hence the fll dynamics remain fast over a broader temperature range and the maximum in @xmath1 is observed at lower temperature ( fig .",
    "it is noticed that the peak in the spin - lattice relaxation rate appears just below the irreversibility temperature , in contrast with what was found in the cuprates , where it is well below the irreversibility line , suggesting a higher fll mobility in these latter compounds .",
    "@xcite    to give a quantitative description of the peak we started from the equation [ 1 ] .",
    "let us first assume that the vortex fluctuations are basically two - dimensional ( 2d ) , that take place in a spatial range smaller than the inter - vortex distance  @xcite @xmath75 ( for a triangular fll ) and that they move by brownian motions  @xcite described by a diffusive - like correlation function @xmath76 , @xmath77 being the diffusion constant of the motion taking place in the @xmath78 plane .",
    "then @xmath79 plays the role of a q - dependent correlation time for the collective vortex motions . by summing over all collective in - plane excitations up to a cut off wave - vector @xmath80 suh et _ al . _",
    "@xcite found the spectral density @xmath81 \\label{jj}\\ ] ] where the average correlation time is @xmath82 .",
    "for the temperature dependence of @xmath83 it is reasonable to assume an activated form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is an average pinning energy barrier and @xmath86 stands for the correlation time in the infinite temperature limit .",
    "accordingly an activated temperature dependence of the spectral density at the larmor frequency and then of @xmath1 are observed for @xmath33 .",
    "the best fits of the data according to this 2d vortex model are reported in fig .",
    "it is noticed that the fit is not fully satisfactory .    on the other hand , as previously pointed out , the low anisotropy of bafe@xmath5as@xmath5 compounds suggests that significant vortex correlations along the @xmath8 axes are present in ba(fe@xmath3rh@xmath4)@xmath5as@xmath5 .",
    "thus , the flux lines have to be considered as stationary waves oscillating in between the pinning centers . in order to take into account this effect we introduced empirically a modulation in the amplitude of the correlation function characterized by a wavelength @xmath87 which has an upper bound given by @xmath88 , the london penetration depth along the @xmath8 axes",
    ". then one can write @xmath89 .",
    "now if we recall the form of the longitudinal field correlation function@xcite @xmath90 and taking the root mean square amplitude of the vortex core fluctuation with respect to equilibrium position @xcite @xmath91 eq . [ h ] can be written : @xmath92 where the temperature dependence is evident .",
    "taking the values for the london penetration depth reported in the literature ,  @xcite the coherence lengths derived from the @xmath93 measurements , and their temperature dependence according to the two - fluid model , we were able to reproduce fairly well the temperature dependence of @xmath1 , which indicates that indeed a `` 3d - correlated - vortices '' model is more appropriate to describe ba(fe@xmath12rh@xmath13)@xmath5as@xmath5 superconductors .",
    "the best fits of the experimental results ( fig .",

    "while the spin - lattice relaxation rate has been considered one of the most valuable microscopic probes of the fll motion , not so much effort has been devoted to the analysis of the spin echo decay time , mainly because its interpretation is not always straightforward .",
    "@xcite as it has been already pointed out in the superconducting state @xmath2 shows a neat anisotropy : the peak found for @xmath105 is significantly reduced and shifted in the @xmath28 configuration .",
    "moreover , we point out that at low - temperature @xmath2 reaches the value expected from the van vleck lattice sums.@xcite in fact , at low temperatures all dynamics are frozen and the only process giving rise to the echo decay is the nuclear dipole - dipole interaction . the peak observed around 10 k",
    "can not be due to a time - dependent modulation of that interaction since we do not expect such an anisotropic behavior , in that case .",
    "on the other hand , given the similarity with @xmath1 peak anisotropy , it is likely that also @xmath2 peak arises from a low frequency vortex dynamics .",
    "nevertheless it should be emphasized that while @xmath1 measurements are sensitive to the fluctuations of the transverse components of the magnetic field , @xmath2 is sensitive to the longitudinal ones . in particular , it should be noticed that when the vortices are strongly correlated along the @xmath8 axes , the flux lines move rigidly and do not affect significantly the transverse field components , while they do change the longitudinal ones .",
    "@xcite hence the information derived from those two types of measurements can be complementary .    in order to analyze the temperature dependence of @xmath2 we need an analytical expression for the spin echo decay . in principle",
    "we should start from a relation similar to eq .",
    "[ h ] , nevertheless here , for the sake of simplicity , we assumed an exponential correlation function for the longitudinal field fluctuations @xmath106 characterized by an average correlation time @xmath107 .",
    "correspondingly we have written the decay of the echo amplitude as a function of the delay @xmath31 between the @xmath108 and @xmath109 pulses in the echo sequence as @xcite @xmath110}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first gaussian term accounts for the nuclear dipole - dipole contribution , while the second term describes the low - frequency vortex motions . by fitting the data below @xmath6 we were able to derive the temperature dependence of the longitudinal correlation time ( fig .",
    "[ tau ] ) . by decreasing the temperature",
    "the fll motion is supposed to go through different motional regimes : from the fast motions ( @xmath111 ) up to the very slow motions ( @xmath112 ) , where the correlation time is so long that we can consider the fll to be frozen in the solid state .",
    "if we fit the data above 11 k , where the peak in @xmath1 is observed , we notice that @xmath107 follows an activated behavior characterized by an activation barrier @xmath113 k much lower than the one derived from @xmath1 ( see .",
    "fig [ tau ] ) . here",
    "we refer just to the fast motion limit , since the fitting procedure is not so much accurate at the low temperatures , because of the reduced signal to noise ratio .",
    "the correlation time derived from the spin - echo decay rate can be suitably compared to that derived from the motional narrowing of the nmr line .",
    "the latter can be derived , for the @xmath26 case , following the standard approach reported in ref .  .",
    "in the fast motions regime , namely @xmath114 , with @xmath115 the square root of the rigid lattice second moment , one has @xmath116 by fitting the correlation time @xmath107 with an arrhenius s law we extracted a pinning energy barrier @xmath117 k , which is consistent with the one derived from the spin echo decay measurements .",
    "this is not surprising since both @xmath29 and @xmath118 probe the longitudinal component of the local field fluctuation .    in order to understand why the energy barrier probed by @xmath2 and from the motional narrowing are smaller than the one derived from @xmath1 measurements",
    "it should be pointed out that the oscillations at wavevector @xmath119 0 do contribute to the longitudinal field fluctuations but only weakly to the transverse field excitations which are relevant in @xmath1 , at variance with the @xmath120 modes , which contribute significantly to @xmath1 .",
    "hence , our findings indicate that the energy cost to activate a certain collective mode increases with increasing @xmath121 , where the @xmath122 subscript refers to the wavevector component parallel to the magnetic field .     gives by echo decay time ( black squares ) is compared with the one derived by the linewidth analysis ( blue circles ) in the assumption of fast motions ( see eq . [ riga ] ) .",
    "the red curves are the fitting of the correlation time , according to an activated law.,width=340,height=302 ]    upon cooling the crystal to the lowest temperatures we observed a change in the line shape from lorentzian to gaussian , as it has to be expected when the correlation time gets longer than a few ms .",
    "the gaussian lineshape , instead of the asymmetric one expected for a perfect triangular lattice , indicates the presence of lattice distortions induced by randomly distributed pinning centers . in this scenario",
    "one can only make an estimate of the london penetration depth which can be compared with the one derived by transverse @xmath123sr ,  @xcite transport  @xcite and the tunnel diode resonator measurements  @xcite on a similar 7.4% co - doped bafe@xmath5as@xmath5 single crystal .",

    "this work aimed at studying the thermally activated vortices motion , by means of @xmath0as microscopic probe .",
    "we found that in the nmr relaxation rates and in the nmr linewidth there is evidence of such motions , which is well supported by the remarkably anisotropic behaviour of those quantities .",
    "we were able to follow the dynamics of the vortices by measuring nmr quantities which are sensitive to motions at different time scales : the peak in the spin - lattice relaxation time is found when the correlation time is about @xmath129 s , while the @xmath2 maximum occurs at a slightly lower temperature , when the correlation time is comparable to @xmath2 , i.e. few ms .",
    "in the temperature window between those peaks the motions are effective and yield the motional narrowing of the nmr line . to observe a line narrowing the correlation times must be smaller than the inverse of the rigid lattice linewidth @xmath130 s. furthermore we pointed out that the temperature dependence of @xmath1 around the peak suggests that the flux lines are formed by strongly coupled vortices rather than nearly independent pancakes diffusing in 2d , as it was found in the cuprates .",

    "<S> @xmath0as nmr spin - lattice relaxation ( @xmath1 ) and spin - echo decay ( @xmath2 ) rate measurements were performed in a single crystal of ba(fe@xmath3rh@xmath4)@xmath5as@xmath5 superconductor . below the superconducting transition temperature @xmath6 , when the magnetic field @xmath7 is applied along the @xmath8 axes , a peak in both relaxation rates is observed . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably that peak is suppressed for @xmath9 . those maxima in @xmath1 and @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> have been ascribed to the flux lines lattice motions and the corresponding correlation times and pinning energy barriers have been derived on the basis of an heuristic model . </S>",
    "<S> further information on the flux lines motion was derived from the narrowing of @xmath0as nmr linewidth below @xmath6 and found to be consistent with that obtained from @xmath2 measurements . </S>",
    "<S> all the experimental results are described in the framework of thermally activated vortices motions . </S>"
