    "the study of the early stages of massive star formation ( msf ) in our galaxy has , until recently , studied relatively litte .",
    "however , with the advent of telescopes , particularly in the millimetre ( mm ) and sub - mm part of the electromagnetic spectrum , it has become possible to study the earliest stages of msf . here is the strongest part of their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) measureable from the ground , as well as a myriad of complex molecular transitions , allowing investigation of the chemistry surrounding these young sources .",
    "g305.2 + 0.2 is a site of msf in the southern galactic plane shown in figure [ ksimb ] .",
    "class ii methanol masers were reported in two positions by @xcite : g305.21 + 0.21 ( hereafter g305a ) and g305.20 + 0.21 ( hereafter g305b ) , separated by approximately 22 . in g305a , the masers are extended along a line with four individual maser spots aligned in approximately the ne  sw direction @xcite .",

    "g305b , on the other hand , contains two weak maser spots .",
    "@xcite observed this region in the near - infrared ( see figure [ ksimb ] ) and found that whilst g305a is not associated with any infrared source , g305b is coincident with a bright and very reddened infrared source .",
    "more sensitive near - infrared observations by @xcite indicate that there is indeed a weak infrared source coincident with g305a , however , it is not clear if it is associated with the maser site or is instaead an unrelated foreground star .",
    "observations in the mid - infrared ( 10.5 and 20@xmath5 m ) by @xcite confirm the infrared source associated with g305b has a steeply rising spectral energy distribution towards longer wavelengths . however , no mid - infrared source was found associated with g305a . neither maser site is coincident with any detected radio continuum source @xcite .",

    "the emission appears to be slightly elongated in the direction of g305b .",
    "therefore it appears g305b may be associated with a weaker dust core , which is spatially unresolved with these observations . in this paper , we attempt to better understand these sources by looking for mm molecular line emission , to trace the dense gas and chemistry of the region .",

    "therefore , even though no observed source has been detected , we believe that g305a harbours enough mass to form a massive star .",
    "furthermore , the class ii methanol maser site associated with g305a strongly suggests there is msf taking place here because no other class ii methanol maser site has been conclusively found associated with anything other than msf , despite previous searches @xcite .",
    "together with the presence of methanol masers and 1.2 mm continuum emission , shown in figure [ ksimb ] , the new mopra observations of g305a conclusively show that the core is associated with bright mm - line emission . since there is no known infrared or radio continuum tracer ,",
    "g305a is likely to be an extremely young site of msf .",
    "it compares well to the class 0 phase of low mass star formation , as it shows strong mm continuum emission , but no detectable ir emission .",
    "the class 0 phase of low mass star formation is characterised by these observational constraints , but is also considered to be a phase of active accretion @xcite .",
    "we caution that we currently have no evidence for ongoing accretion in this high mass case , apart from the indirect evidence of the red outflow wings , as seen in figure [ spec ] .",
    "the spatial resolution of the mopra data is insufficient to establish whether or not g305a is the powering source of the outflow",
    ". we can not assume accretion is taking place because accretion processes are expected to proceed on much shorter timescales than for low mass star formation .",
    "therefore , it is conceivable that accretion has ceased in g305a but it still remains extremely deeply embedded and is thus not seen in the ir . on the other hand , g305a may be in the short - lived accretion phase . in any case",
    ", g305a is an excellent test case for accretion processes in msf .    because g305a does not show any signs of near - infrared @xcite or mid - infrared @xcite emission up to 20@xmath5 m , the presence of strong class ii methanol maser emission is somewhat of a mystery .",
    "class ii methanol masers are thought to be pumped by infrared photons from warm ( t@xmath41 150k ) dust @xcite .",
    "current observations extend only to 20@xmath5 m , and so the pumping photons may well be found only at longer wavelengths .",
    "however , the peak of a 150k black body should be about 20@xmath5 m , suggesting that there should be a bright mid - infrared source where there is bright methanol maser emission . in any case",
    ", g305a should be a useful testbed of methanol maser pumping regimes .",
    "table [ tab2 ] shows that the lte and virial derived masses from @xmath0co , hco@xmath1 and n@xmath2h@xmath1 are all consistent within a factor of a few .",
    "lte masses derived using @xmath0co and hco@xmath1 appear lower than the mass derived from the dust measurements , however it is difficult to pinpoint the cause of this , since there are many possible reasons , for instance the lines may be tracing slightly cooler gas and so the assumption of 20k gas temperature may be incorrect .",
    "we note that if the gas temperature were only 10k , then the lte masses would increase to 4000m@xmath16 for @xmath0co and 2500m@xmath16 for hco@xmath1 .",
    "another possibility is that there is some depletion of these species onto dust grains , causing an apparent drop in the lte mass .",
    "it is also possible that the emission is optically thick , which would also have the effect of reducing the apparent lte mass . at this stage , it is impossible for us to disentangle these contributing factors .",
    "g305b is coincident with a deeply embedded infrared source with a steeply rising sed . at 10@xmath5 m",
    ", this is the brightest source within the field of view .",
    "based on the infrared data , @xcite expected that such a bright ir source should produce a detectable radio continuum source .",
    "however , none was detected .",
    "in fact , @xcite show g305b to have one of the largest discrepancies between the bright infrared emission and the undetected radio continuum emission in their sample of 31 sources .",
    "this suggests that g305b is also at a very early stage of evolution .",
    "presumably , a massive star has already formed at the centre due to the presence of the near - infrared source , yet no detectable radio continuum source has developed .",
    "it is unclear exactly why this might happen , although theories such as accretion through an uc hii region @xcite could explain this .",
    "n@xmath2h@xmath1 emission is seen to extend to the south - west of the two maser sites , ending in the peak g305sw .",
    "g305sw appears only in the n@xmath2h@xmath1 integrated intensity map .",
    "this is an unexpected result because the critical density for n@xmath2h@xmath1 ( @xmath42 ; ungerechts et al .",
    "1997 ) is two orders of magnitude higher than that of @xmath0co ( @xmath43 ; ungerechts et al .",
    "therefore , we would expect any high density core such as g305sw to also exhibit emission in low density tracers .",
    "figure [ g305swspec ] shows spectra at the position of g305sw , integrated over a square box 30  on a side .",
    "the figure shows that whilst there is some @xmath0co and hco@xmath1 emission at this position , it is much weaker in comparison to g305a .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0co and hco@xmath1 emission does not match in radial velocity to the n@xmath2h@xmath1 , with a difference of 1.5kms@xmath4 : the radial velocity of @xmath0co and hco@xmath1 more closely matches that of the emission associated with g305a .",
    "with such a large velocity difference , it is unlikely that this is the result of self - absorbed gas moving along the line of sight ( in this case the motions would be outward , rather than the usual infall motions ) .",
    "we conclude that most of the low density gas , traced by @xmath0co and hco@xmath1 , is not associated with g305sw and is probably associated with g305a .",
    "g305sw is also unusual in that the n@xmath2h@xmath1 line width is only 1.6kms@xmath4 .",
    "this is very narrow compared to the line width of the n@xmath2h@xmath1 spectrum in figure [ spec ] for g305a of 6.4kms@xmath4 .",
    "figure [ lwidth ] shows the distribution of n@xmath2h@xmath1 line widths across the field of view , using those spectra with strong enough emission to fit the hyperfine structure .",
    "the minimum line width is clearly seen at a position coincident with g305sw .",
    "figure [ ksimb ] shows that no 1.2 mm continuum emission was detected at the position of g305sw . assuming a black body temperature of 20k , a gas to dust ratio of 100:1 and a mass absorption coefficient of 0.1m@xmath44kg@xmath4 , any source located at g305sw must be less than 30@xmath45 .",
    "this is an unusually low mass compared to g305a . even if our assumption of the dust temperature is incorrect , a dust temperature of 10k yields a mass upper limit of only 75@xmath45",
    "this can be compared to the lte - derived mass ( table [ tab2 ] ) of 1100m@xmath16 .",
    "thus , there appears to be a discrepancy between the dust upper limit and the n@xmath2h@xmath1 source by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "the virial mass is then @xmath46 .",
    "equation [ eq1 ] assumes a uniform density profile .",
    "however , if we assume a density profile that falls off as @xmath47 then the virial mass will be @xmath48 . in either case",
    ", the virial mass upper limit is about an order of magnitude higher than the mass upper limit calculated from the 1.2 mm continuum observations .",
    "our virial mass estimation is only an upper limit because the n@xmath2h@xmath1 emission is unresolved with the mopra observations .",
    "it is certainly conceivable that g305sw is much smaller than this , bringing the virial and dust masses more in line , however the n@xmath2h@xmath1 lte mass is still much larger than expected .    what is the nature of g305sw ?",
    "one possible explanation for the lack of other tracers than n@xmath2h@xmath1 is that the region may be very cold and dense , where all other species have frozen out of the gas phase onto grains , leaving n@xmath2h@xmath1 ",
    "one of the last species to freeze out @xcite  in the gas phase .",
    "the fact that the 1.2 mm continuum observations indicate there is less than 100@xmath45 in g305sw and yet the n@xmath2h@xmath1  emission is consistent with an lte mass about an order of magnitude larger , confirms that chemistry must play a significant role .",
    "g305sw may well be a cold , quiescent core perhaps about to undergo star formation .",
    "the narrow n@xmath2h@xmath1 linewidth of g305sw also supports this scenario .",
    "the fact that the virial mass may be much larger than the mass derived from the dust continuum measurements suggests that g305sw may well be an unbound , transient phenomenon , and we can not rule this out .    to fully assess the nature of g305sw ,",
    "it is clear that higher spatial resolution observations are needed .",
    "it is conceivable that the n@xmath2h@xmath1  emission breaks up into a number of small cores at higher resolution , in which case the individual cores may well be bound .",
    "= @xmath4942.8kms@xmath4 , which is determined from a hyperfine fit to the n@xmath2h@xmath1 spectrum .",
    "multiple dashed lines indicate the positions of hyperfine components for n@xmath2h@xmath1  and rotational lines for ch@xmath3oh  and ch@xmath3cn . ]",
    "g305n appears as a peak of 1.2 mm continuum emission , as well as in the @xmath0co , hco@xmath1 , n@xmath2h@xmath1 and ch@xmath3oh ( @xmath50 ) a@xmath1 integrated intensity maps , but does not show any infrared , radio continuum nor methanol maser emission .",
    "@xcite calculate a core mass of @xmath51 .",
    "@xcite detect eight 1.2 mm continuum sources in their field of view around g305.2 + 0.2 , with masses ranging from 39@xmath45 to @xmath52 , of which g305n is a typical source .",
    "they commonly find other 1.2 mm continuum sources with comparable masses to g305n , so it is possible that this source will form massive stars .",
    "since g305n does not show any signs of msf  no masers , radio continuum or bright infrared sources  it may also be a good candidate for examining the early stages of msf .",
    "we have used the mopra radiotelescope to image mm line transitions of @xmath0co , hco@xmath1 , n@xmath2h@xmath1 , ch@xmath3cn  and ch@xmath3oh  in the massive star forming region g3052.+0.2 .",
    "we show that the main centre of line emission is g305a , a methanol maser site that has no detected infrared or radio continuum emission and is likely to be a massive star in an early stage of formation , similar to the class 0 stage of low mass star formation .",
    "g305b is a second methanol maser site , coincident with a bright , red infrared source whose bolometric luminosity suggests it should produce a detectable hii region , yet none has been detected .",
    "this suggests that g305b may also be at a very early stage of evolution , but probably older than g305a .",
    "g305sw is a newly detected source which only shows up clearly in n@xmath2h@xmath1  emission .",
    "its lack of other tracers and narrow linewidth suggest that it may be a cold , quiescent prestellar core , although it may also be an unbound , transient phenomenon .    other prestellar cores may exist ( eg .",
    "g305n ) , and on the other hand more evolved massive star forming sites occur ( eg . the compact hii region to the west of g305b ) .",
