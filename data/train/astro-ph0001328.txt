    "the inhomogeneous cooling flow scenario ( e.g. , fabian 1994 ) is often invoked to interpret the x - ray observations of massive elliptical galaxies , groups , and clusters . the key prediction of this scenario is the existence of large quantities of gas that have cooled out of the hot phase and dropped out of the flow .",
    "the only evidence for large amounts of mass drop - out arises from the excess soft x - ray absorption from cold gas found for many cooling flows especially from spectral analysis of _ einstein _ and _ asca _ data ( e.g. , white et al 1991 ; fabian et al 1994 ; buote & fabian 1998 ; buote 1999 , 2000a ) .",
    "this interpretation is highly controversial because for systems with low galactic columns no excess absorption from cold gas is ever found with the _ rosat _ pspc which should be more sensitive because of its softer bandpass , 0.1 - 2.4 kev ( e.g. , david et al 1994 ; jones et al 1997 ; briel & henry 1996 ) . furthermore , the large intrinsic columns of cold h indicated by the _ einstein _ and _ asca _ data are in embarrassing disagreement with h1 and co observations ( e.g. , bregman , hogg , & roberts 1992 ; odea et al 1994 ) .",
    "we have found new evidence for absorption in the pspc data during our investigation of the radial metallicity profiles of several of the brightest , nearby cooling flows ( buote 2000b , hereafter paper2 ) . in this _ letter _",
    "we present absorption profiles for a subset of these cooling flows obtained from analysis of the deprojected pspc spectra and briefly compare these results to single - aperture _ asca _ spectra .",
    "we focus on the galaxy , ngc 1399 , the group , ngc 5044 , and the cluster , a1795 because these systems have ( 1 ) low galactic @xmath4 which facilitates analysis of any intrinsic absorption , ( 2 ) the most significant excess columns measured from two - component spectral models with _",
    "asca _ , and ( 3 ) the most clearly significant differences in @xmath5 obtained from pspc data when energies below @xmath6 kev are included / excluded from analysis .",
    "the temperature and metallicity profiles , as well as results for a few other systems not satisfying all the above conditions , will be given in paper2 and buote ( 2000c , hereafter paper3 ) .",
    "we obtained archival _ rosat _ pspc observations of ngc 1399 , ngc 5044 , and a1795 and reduced the data as described in paper2 . here",
    "we mention that particular attention was given to excluding any significant fluctuations in the light curves since contamination from solar emission would preferentially appear in the low - energy channels .",
    "we also developed our own software to properly scale the background spectra to the source positions .",
    "for each object we extracted spectra in concentric circular annuli located at the x - ray centroid such that for each annulus the width was @xmath7 and the background - subtracted counts was larger than some value chosen to minimize uncertainties on the spectral parameters for each system while maintaining as many annuli as possible .",
    "data with energies @xmath8 kev were excluded to insure that the psf was @xmath9 fwhm . for our on - axis sources",
    "@xmath10 of the psf at 0.2 kev is contained within @xmath11 .",
    "we deproject the data following mclaughlin ( 1999 ) who elaborates on the original paper by fabian et al ( 1981 ) .",
    "the spectral fitting is performed with xspec v10.0 using the mekal code to model the ( single - phase ) hot plasma emission .",
    "we used the photoelectric absorption cross sections of baluciska - church & mccammon ( 1992 ) .",
    "although arabadjis & bregman ( 1999 ) point out that the he cross section at 0.15 kev is in error by 13% , since we analyze @xmath12 kev we find that our fits do not change when using the morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) cross sections which have the correct he value .",
    "further details of our deprojection analysis are discussed in paper2 .",
    "no excess absorption from cold gas is found in cooling flows with the pspc when energies down to @xmath13 - 0.2 kev are included , whereas significant absorption ( similar to that obtained by _ asca _ ) is found when the pspc spectrum is restricted to energies above @xmath14 kev ( allen & fabian 1997 ; buote 1999 ) . presently , the only viable explanation of why large excess absorbing columns are not inferred when energies down to @xmath13 - 0.2 kev are included is that the standard foreground screen model systematically underestimates the true column intrinsic to the cooling flow ( allen & fabian 1997 ; sarazin , wise , & markevitch 1998 ) .",
    "allen & fabian show in their figure 9 that a simulated pspc cluster spectrum modified by both a foreground column of @xmath15 @xmath16 plus an intrinsic column of @xmath17 @xmath16 with covering fraction 0.5 will always yield a value similar to the foreground column if fitted only with a standard foreground model .",
    "however , such two - component models usually represent the projection of extended gas ( with no intrinsic absorption ) with centrally concentrated , intrinsically absorbed gas , and thus the suitability of these models can be tested via deprojection .    in figure [ fig.proj ]",
    "we display the pspc spectrum for ngc 1399 within @xmath11 ( 2d ) and show the model representing the projection of gas from @xmath18 ( 3d ) into the @xmath11 aperture modified by a foreground galactic absorber with solar abundances .",
    "the deprojection separates the foreground component ( i.e. the projected model in fig [ fig.proj ] ) from the intrinsic gas and shows that the intrinsic component can not be absorbed very differently from the outer gas since their spectral shapes below @xmath14 kev are so similar ; e.g. , for an intrinsic absorber with covering factor of 0.5 we obtain a best - fit @xmath19 and @xmath20 at @xmath21 confidence . since we obtain analogous results for ngc 5044 and a1795 , we conclude that the deprojected pspc spectra for each system rule out absorption by large amounts of intrinsic cold gas ( especially h and he ) as a viable explanation of the different excess absorbing columns obtained from analyses in different x - ray bandpasses .",
    "a solution to this problem becomes apparent upon examination of how varies with the lower energy limit in the centers of cooling flows .",
    "for example , in the central @xmath22 of ngc 1399 we find that @xmath23 when @xmath24 - 0.3 kev , though when @xmath25 kev increases to @xmath26 .",
    "a dramatic change occurs for @xmath27 kev where increases to several times , although for larger @xmath28 remains nearly constant . in figure [ fig.nh ]",
    "we plot @xmath29 for @xmath30 , 0.5 kev for ngc 1399 , 5044 , and a1795 .",
    "the profiles radically differ for each @xmath31 : @xmath32 when @xmath30 kev , but @xmath29 increases significantly at small @xmath33 when @xmath34 kev such that @xmath35 at @xmath21 confidence within @xmath11 .",
    "( the uncertainties are computed from 100 monte carlo realizations of the best - fitting models in each 2d annulus .",
    "our simple procedure for defining confidence limits ( see paper2 ) occasionally results in the best - fitting value lying outside the @xmath36 errors . )     * ngc 1399 3.75 cm ngc 5044 4.2 cm a1795 *    -0.1 cm    since @xmath37 for @xmath38 kev the portion of the spectrum responsible for the absorption must be @xmath39 - 0.7 kev considering the pspc resolution .",
    "the most important absorption ( and emission ) features over these energies are due to oxygen . in figure [ fig.nh ]",
    "we also show the deprojection results for @xmath30 kev including an edge at 0.532 kev ( rest frame ) corresponding to cold oxygen ( o1 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath29 is very similar to the previous fits with @xmath30 kev and no edge ( i.e. , similar to galactic ) , and the edge optical depth profiles , @xmath40 , closely resemble @xmath29 when @xmath34 kev .",
    "the large optical depths at small radii and the improvements in the fits when adding the edge are highly significant . in the @xmath11 bins the 95% confidence lower limits on @xmath41 are 0.97 , 0.59 , and 0.21 respectively for ngc 1399 , 5044 , and a1795 .",
    "furthermore , 99 out of 100 monte carlo simulations predict @xmath41 larger than 0.31 , 0.10 , and 0.17 respectively ; i.e. , @xmath42 is highly significant for these systems in the inner radial bin .",
    "the fits are improved substantially when the edge is introduced in the central bin of each system  see table [ tab.chi ] where we list the values of @xmath43 , degrees of freedom ( dof ) , and null hypothesis probability @xmath44 .",
    "( note that for ngc 1399 the edge improves the fits significantly more than by letting the oxygen abundance in the hot gas go to zero : i.e. , @xmath43 improves only to 95.9 as opposed to 83.7 for the edge . )",
    "we emphasize that for the large values of @xmath45 obtained in the central regions the absorption from the edge affects a large energy range comparable to the resolution of the pspc over @xmath6 - 0.7 kev ; e.g. , the o1 edge absorbs 25% of the flux at 0.8 kev for @xmath46 .    for most",
    "radii the constraints on the edge energy are not very precise which is why we fixed the edge energy in our analysis . if we allow the edge energy to be a free parameter in the central radial bin we obtain @xmath47 kev , @xmath48 kev , and @xmath49 kev ( 90% confidence ) for the edge energies of ngc 1399 , 5044 , and a1795 .",
    "these constraints are consistent with the lower ionization states of oxygen but not edges from the highest states o6 - 8 .",
    "due to the limited resolution we can add additional edges to share the @xmath41 obtained for the o1 edges , although even with a two - edge model a significant @xmath41 can not be obtained for edge energies above @xmath50 kev corresponding to @xmath51o6 .",
    "( we mention that the models for ngc 5044 with @xmath30 kev not only imply @xmath52 for small @xmath33 but also predict very large metallicities that are inconsistent with the _ asca _ data . if is fixed to then consistent metallicities are obtained as are @xmath40 and @xmath43 improvements very similar to the free case ",
    "see figure [ fig.nh ] and table [ tab.chi ] ; see also paper2 and paper3 . )",
    "lcccc & ngc 1399 & & a1795 +   + & & free @xmath5 & @xmath53 + no edge & 104.9/96/0.25 & 138.6/117/8.5e-2 & 191.2/118/2.3e-5 & 253.2/182/3.8e-4 + w/ edge & 83.7/95/0.79 & 126.4/116/0.24 & 156.5/117/8.7e-3 & 212.0/181/5.7e-2 +",
    "the intrinsic oxygen absorption indicated by the pspc data is most significant in the central @xmath22 which is much smaller than the width of the _ asca _ psf .",
    "in addition , since the _ asca _ sis is limited to @xmath54 kev , and the efficiency near 0.5 kev is limited due to instrumental oxygen absorption , it can not be expected that _",
    "asca _ can distinguish an oxygen edge from an absorber with solar abundances .",
    "nevertheless , we briefly summarize the results obtained when adding an oxygen edge to the _ asca _ data .",
    "previously we ( buote 1999 ) have fitted two - temperature models to the accumulated _ asca _ sis and gis data within @xmath55 of ngc 1399 and 5044 and obtained @xmath56 @xmath16 respectively for the cooler temperature components .",
    "examination of figure [ fig.nh ] shows that these columns are @xmath57 times the values in the central arcminute and are consistent with the total columns within @xmath55 obtained from the pspc for @xmath34 kev . if instead we add an o1 edge to the cooler _ asca _ model components ( while keeping fixed to galactic on each component ) we obtain ( 1 ) fits of comparable quality ( slightly better ) to the original models and ( 2 ) optical depths that agree with the cumulative values obtained from the pspc .    for a1795",
    "we have re - analyzed the _",
    "data within @xmath58 and obtained results very similar to fabian et al ( 1994 ) for two - temperature models .",
    "as above , we obtain fits with an oxygen edge supplying the excess absorption that are as good as those obtained with an excess absorber having solar abundances . unlike the ellipticals and groups , for the cluster a1795 the cooler temperature component contributes only @xmath59 to the emission measure , and",
    "thus its fitted parameters are not nearly as well constrained as for ngc 1399 and 5044 ; i.e. , although the best - fitting @xmath60 , the 90% lower limit is 0.6 which is comparable to the total optical depth inferred from the pspc ( fig [ fig.nh ] ) .",
    "hence , the oxygen edge provides as good or better description of the excess absorption inferred from multitemperature models of _ asca _ data within the central few arcminutes of ngc 1399 , 5044 , and a1795 as a cold absorber with solar abundances , and yields optical depths that are consistent with those obtained with the pspc data .",
    "using spatially resolved , deprojected x - ray spectra from the _ rosat _ pspc we have detected strong oxygen absorption intrinsic to the central @xmath1 of the elliptical galaxy , ngc 1399 , the group , ngc 5044 , and the cluster , a1795 which are amongst the largest nearby cooling flows in their respective classes and have low galactic columns ( e.g. , fabian et al 1994 ; buote & fabian 1998 ; buote 1999 , 2000a ) . modeling the oxygen absorption with an edge ( rest frame @xmath61 kev ) produces the necessary absorption in both the pspc and _ asca _ data for @xmath62 kev without violating the pspc constraints over @xmath63 kev for which no significant excess absorption is indicated .",
    "this reconciles many reported discrepancies between absorbing columns inferred from _ rosat _ with those obtained from _",
    "asca _ and other instruments with bandpasses above @xmath6 kev .",
    "moreover , there is no need for large absorbing columns of cold h which are known to be very inconsistent with the negligible atomic and molecular h measured in cooling flows ( e.g. , bregman et al 1992 ; odea et al 1994 ) .    since no excess absorption is detected over @xmath63 kev , and since the edge energies allow for ionized states of oxygen , the most reasonable model for the absorber is warm , collisionally ionized gas with @xmath3 k. at these temperatures the majority of the absorption arises from oxygen but with a sizeable contribution from ionized carbon and nitrogen ( see paper3 ) .",
    "arnaud & mushotzky ( 1998 ) have reported the detection of an o1 edge in the perseus cluster using bbxrt data . their cooling flow model ( which has stronger oxygen lines than two - temperature models ) requires an edge energy that is consistent only with cold oxygen , and thus warm ionized gas could not be responsible for the absorption .",
    "however , it was not shown that multiple edges from different ionization states are inconsistent with the data , and thus we expect that a multi - edge model would fit as well as a single o1 edge since the bbxrt has lower energy resolution than _ asca_. ( we do not find any evidence for excess oxygen absorption in perseus from the pspc data probably because of the large galactic column , but @xmath64 for the o1 edge obtained by arnaud & mushotzky is similar to what we found for a1795 with _",
    "asca_. )    the warm ionized gas implied for ngc 1399 , 5044 , and a1795 ( and possibly perseus ) could be the much sought - after mass that has dropped out of the cooling flows .",
    "in paper3 we show that the absorber masses indicated by the oxygen edge optical depths are consistent with the mass expected to have been deposited by the cooling flow over the lifetime of the system , while the emission expected from the warm gas does not violate published optical and uv constraints .",
    "understanding the details of how warm ionized gas is maintained and supported in such large quantities is a serious theoretical challenge .",
    "since detection of the warm ionized gas at other wavelengths is difficult , e.g. , background qsos have not been found within @xmath11 of strong cooling flows ( miller , bregman , & knezek 2000 ) , confirmation will probably have to be realized in the x - ray band .",
    "fortunately , the ccds of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ missions have the combined spatial and spectral resolution and include energies down to @xmath13 kev to verify our prediction of warm ionized gas in these and other cooling flows .",
    "the @xmath65 ev resolution of the _ astro - e _ xrs will place strong constraints on the allowed ionization states of oxygen .",
    "hence , data from these new missions will elucidate the properties of the warm ionized gas and thus the role of cooling flows in the formation and evolution of ellipticals , groups , and clusters .",
