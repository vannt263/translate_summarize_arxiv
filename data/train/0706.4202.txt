    "since the first realization in 1994 @xcite quantum cascade lasers ( qcls ) have become an important tool for ir - spectroscopy . the extension towards the thz region @xcite has opened up possibilities for a variety of applications in rapid - but - precise hazardous chemical sensing , concealed weapon detection , non - invasive medical and biological diagnostics , and high - speed telecommunications @xcite .",
    "the operation of qcls is based on electronic transitions between different subbands within the conduction band of a semiconductor heterostructure . using a sophisticated sequence of wells and barriers ,",
    "the electrons are guided into the upper laser level at the operating bias , thus creating population inversion for a pair of levels in the active region . by modifying the layer thicknesses ,",
    "the transition energy can be varied in a large range and operating lasers with wavelengths between 2.95@xmath0 m @xcite and 217 @xmath0 m ( 1.39 thz ) @xcite have been realized within the last year .",
    "this covers a large part of the electromagnetic spectrum from the near - infrared to the proximity of fast electrical circuits ( albeit there is a gap at the reststrahlenband ) .",
    "conventionally , qcls are modeled by rate equation schemes either for the average electron densities in the subbands @xcite , or the occupation of the individual states @xcite .",
    "the latter ones are often simulated with the monte - carlo technique , which suggests this denomination , albeit the term _ hopping transport _ @xcite seems to be more appropriate for this type of models .",
    "such simulations allowed for a continuous improvement of device performance by optimizing the layer structure for an appropriate ratio of scattering matrix elements and resonance conditions . hopping or rate equation models can however not describe coherent effects , which are of some relevance for the tunneling transition between the injector into the upper laser level @xcite . furthermore , the broadening of the gain transition can only be qualitatively estimated within such models . to overcome these limitations , a quantum transport model based on nonequilibrium green functions ( negf )",
    "was developed @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that the microscopic current flow is due to coherent evolution of wave packets rather than the spatial translation by scattering transitions @xcite .",
    "here this idea is further elaborated with a particular focus on the relation between the negf model , density matrix equations @xcite , and the above mentioned hopping transport models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the different concepts for calculating a current in qcls ( or similar semiconductor heterostructures elements ) are discussed .",
    "a key result is that the entire current is carried by nondiagonal elements of the density matrix ( coherences ) , as also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in section 3 ,",
    "we present numerical examples for the different representations of current . in the more technical sections 4 and 5 it",
    "is shown how the density matrix equations , and the standard hopping models are derived by successive simplifications of the greens function technique .",
    "in planar semiconductor heterostructures , such as qcls or superlattices , it is appropriate to use a set of normalized basis states @xmath1 which separate the behavior in growth direction ( @xmath2 ) with quantum number @xmath3 from the plane wave behavior ( @xmath4 ) in the @xmath5-plane of total area @xmath6 .",
    "the hamilton operator is written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the conduction band edge for our structure with period @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the ( self - consistent ) electric potential satisfying @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the average electric field along the structure . here",
    "it is important to note , that @xmath13 is diagonal in @xmath4 due to the translational symmetry of the perfect qcl structure in the @xmath5-plane .",
    "in contrast , impurities , phonons and possibly the presence of other electrons constitute scattering terms of the form @xmath14 with @xmath15 in @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are the standard creation and annihilation operators in occupation number representation , respectively . in the following we use the wannier basis for our calculations ,",
    "see @xcite , which provides a periodic array of states satisfying @xmath19 .",
    "the same property holds for wannier - stark ( ws ) states as well , which in addition diagonalize @xmath13 with energies @xmath20 .",
    "the current can be evaluated in two ways : the current density averaged over the entire sample reads @xmath21\\rangle\\\\ = & \\frac{2\\mbox{(for spin)}{{\\rm i}}e}{\\hbar v } \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta,{\\bf k } } w_{\\beta\\alpha } \\rho_{\\alpha\\beta}({\\bf k } ) \\label{eqjaverage } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the density matrix ( here defined to be diagonal in @xmath4 ) , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the normalization volume of the system with @xmath25 periods .",
    "note that the second contribution of the hamiltonian ( [ eqham ] ) provides @xmath26\\rangle=0 $ ] , as the operator @xmath27 is only a function of @xmath28 , but not of @xmath29 , for all scattering processes typically considered @xcite .",

    "averaging over @xmath2 and using the commutator relation @xmath32 = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 } \\left(\\frac{1}{m(z)}{\\frac{\\partial{}}{\\partial{z}}}+{\\frac{\\partial{}}{\\partial{z}}}\\frac{1}{m(z)}\\right ) \\label{eqcommrelation}\\ ] ] provides directly eq .",
    "( [ eqjaverage ] ) .",
    "it is important to notice , that the matrix @xmath33 is anti - hermitian .",
    "thus the diagonal elements vanish for a set of real basis functions and consequently the entire current is due to the nondiagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath34 .",
    "the same holds for eq .",
    "( [ eqjz ] ) : if the wave functions @xmath35 are real , the diagonal elements of the density matrix do not provide any contribution to the current .",
    "now both the wannier and wannier - stark basis functions can be chosen real and therefore in both cases the current is entirely being carried by the non - diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath34 .",
    "working with negf @xcite , the density matrix is given by @xmath36 thus , the correlation functions @xmath37 can be viewed as the energy - resolved density matrix and eq .",

    "then the current as well as the density is represented by an incoherent superposition of complex wave functions @xmath39 at each energy .",
    "the fact that these wave functions carry the entire current manifests the coherent nature of current evolution in qcls as well as related structures such as superlattices .",

    "the amplitude of these oscillations decreases with the number of wannier states per period employed in the calculations .",
