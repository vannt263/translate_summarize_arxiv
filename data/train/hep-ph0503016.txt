    "such decrease in mass predicted by brown and rho @xcite was made obvious in the work referred to above as coming from tadpoles connecting the scalar density to the relevant vector meson , as shown in fig .  1 , basically an extension of walecka mean field theory .",
    "this is well and fine for finite density , although the experiments take us up to only @xmath13 .",

    "on the other hand , the @xmath22 lgs transition is second order and , as a result , the pion mass must remain zero , in the chiral limit , as @xmath20 moves upwards through @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , the pion and sigma mesons are equivalent excitations as chiral symmetry and helicity are restored at @xmath14 , so , in the chiral limit , these should be massless .",
    "we have no such guiding symmetry above @xmath14 for the ( equivalent ) vector and axial vector excitations , except that the vector mass goes to zero as @xmath20 approaches @xmath14 from below @xcite .",

    "since the rms radius of our chirally restored mesons is @xmath43 fm at @xmath14 , it is clear that for the regime of @xmath20 in the neighborhood of @xmath14 , the running coupling is the same as the much studied zero temperature one .    as in brown et al.@xcite , in order to enforce the asymptotic freedom at the origin , we used the molecule radius as r .",

    "note that the situation above @xmath14 with quarks having thermal masses is unfamiliar to many research workers , but it is completely analogous to that in heavy atoms where the thermal mass is simply a ( repulsive ) coulomb potential , which transforms like the 4th component of a 4-vector .",

    ". we will not deal with the many further excitations above @xmath14 , considered by shuryak and zahed @xcite , but simply note again that the increase in entropy in going up to @xmath14 can be furnished by our 32 massless mesons there .",
    "in blrs@xcite we based our construction of the @xmath27 and @xmath51 mesons on their chiral properties ; i.e. , that the zero mass ( in the chiral limit ) of the pion should go smoothly through @xmath14 . at @xmath14 and above the @xmath51",

[ fig5 ] looks very impressive at first sight , we caution that the data points ( points from the lgs ) that we have for the lower @xmath74 values do not go to distances shorter than @xmath75 fm , whereas our rms radius at @xmath14 is only @xmath76 of this",
    ". however , kaczmarek et al .",

    "it s hard to separate the pure coulombic effect from non - perturbative effects in our approach .",

    "( [ veff ] ) .",
    "we believe that the stronger couplings for lower temperatures towards @xmath14 indicate the stronger non - perturbative effect near @xmath14 . for small distances , @xmath78 fm ,",
    "the strength of the potential @xmath79 is dominated by the radius , close to the zero temperature limit .",
    "we can obtain a semi quantitative picture of why the meson masses are small at @xmath14 in the following way .",
    "kkzp show that the short distance color averaged free energy is dominated by the singlet contribution .",
    "this interaction is very large at large distances , as shown by the polyakov loops in quenched qcd ( fig .  4 of kkzp @xcite ) .",
    "thus , overall we believe that we can talk about coulomb interactions ( realizing that the discussion will not be gauge invariant ) in order to provide a simple picture .    with the doubling of the effective coulomb interaction by inclusion of the velocity - velocity term and with the casimir operator @xmath80 , we would obtain a ( large distance ) _ eff ( r ) = = from the polyakov loops at @xmath14 , corresponding to g_eff~8 .",
    "of course this implies strong coupling .",
    "it seems reasonable that this large color singlet coupling is largely responsible for the large @xmath81 ; indeed , rescaling the quenched 1 gev @xmath81 , which we used at @xmath14 , would give @xmath82 mev for the unquenched one .    in order to show why all of the curves in fig .",

    "the coulomb is attractive , but in our gauge theory , must go to zero as the separation @xmath85 , because of asymptotic freedom .",
    "viewing the potentials as like that in the hydrogen atom , we would expect the bound level to come down about halfway in the coulomb potential ; i.e. , the zero point energy would be about half of the potential depth .    with the doubling in the potential from the velocity - velocity interaction , the molecular state comes down to @xmath84 .",
    "this argument explains why the states in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] all go to zero , independently of @xmath81 .",
    "our calculations support this picture ; the potentials are approximately rescaled hydrogenic ones .",
    "we see from our model how asymptotic freedom giving perturbative interactions at short distances , can be reconciled with strong large distance behavior .",
    "in fact , kkzp@xcite find that for their purpose of defining a running coupling at finite temperature the singlet free energy is most appropriate , as it has at short ( @xmath86 ) as well as large ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) distances and temperatures a simple asymptotic behavior which is dominated by one gluon exchange ; i.e. , f_1(r , t ) = \\ {    l - , r(t , t_c ) 1 + - e^-g(t ) r t    . . in our case",
    "the meson at @xmath14 with rms radius @xmath89 fm is well inside the @xmath76 fm debye screening length , so only the ( upper ) perturbative coulombic expression in @xmath90 is needed .",
    "our essential step in going from the heavy - quark color singlet potential to the light - quark description is to add the velocity - velocity interaction . in blrs@xcite",
    "the instanton molecule interaction played an even larger part , but with our very much smaller coulomb bound states here from the lattice parameters , these are essentially negligible .",
    "the velocity - velocity potential was derived for the interaction of k - electrons in heavy atoms , holding for stationary states @xcite .",
    "this interaction was important in reproducing the k - absorption edges of heavy atoms @xcite , where @xmath91 was not much less than unity .",
    "we have shown @xcite that low - mass chirally restored mesons just above @xmath14 will explain some of the data from rhic , which is difficult to understand in the standard scenario , and have made predictions for other experiments .",
    "chiefly , however , our introduction of the velocity - velocity dependent term allows us to separate the 64 degrees of freedom into 32 that have zero energy at @xmath14 , in our model and in the chiral limit , at @xmath14 , with the other 32 lying in mass @xmath92 , and therefore irrelevant for the thermodynamics .",
    "our approach is the only one giving exactly the correct number ( as measured in lgs ) of degrees of freedom at @xmath14 .",
    "our results using the numbers from the bielefeld lgs essentially confirm the scenario of brown et al .",
    "@xcite that chiral restoration is reached by mesons going massless .",
    "this followed from brown / rho scaling @xcite . the discussion of relevant degrees of freedom ; i.e. , relevant mesons was , however , clarified only much later in blrs @xcite .",
    "the 32 degrees of freedom going massless at @xmath14 is precisely the number lattice calculations require in order to fit the entropy increase up to @xmath14 .",
    "the pressure is given by these degrees of freedom only for a narrow range of temperatures from @xmath14 up to @xmath93 where contributions begin from an additional large number of binary bound states , both colorless and colored pairs @xmath94 and @xmath95 @xcite .    although chiral restoration was discussed many years ago in terms of chirally restored mesons , the importance of the color coulomb interaction was only understood recently , when lattice calculations found charmonium to be bound up to @xmath96 .",
    "this statement does not take into account many earlier published studies by ismail zahed , who explained to us the importance of the color coulomb interaction .",
    "we emphasize our indebtedness to his work and to his tutelage .    in blrs @xcite we employed a schematic model for the heavy quark color coulomb interaction with @xmath97 chosen to be @xmath76 in order to bind charmonium up to @xmath96 .",
    "our coulomb bound states were then rather large at @xmath14 , with rms radius @xmath98 fm , roughly the size of the instanton . given these large bound states , the instanton molecule interaction played an important role in bringing their energy to zero at @xmath14 .",
    "in the neighborhood of @xmath14 the lattice color coulomb potential we use here is more than twice as large as the schematic one used in blrs @xcite , with the results that the coulomb bound states are so small that the instanton molecule interactions are negligible at @xmath14 .",
    "aside from reproducing correctly the number of degrees of freedom in the entropy , energy and pressure at @xmath14 , our scenario should be able to give descriptions in detail of dynamical processes , such as the @xmath99 ratio measured by star collaboration @xcite .",
    "we also noted in that reference that many dileptons should be emitted from the region just above @xmath14 where the @xmath7-mesons have low masses .",
    "in brown et al . @xcite it was incorrectly stated that the @xmath7-mesons from the region of temperatures just above @xmath14 would give dileptons of low invariant masses , especially where the cocktail peaks up .",
    "in fact , because of the @xmath100 thermal energy of the @xmath7 above @xmath14 , the invariant dilepton masses , which contain this thermal energy , should come in the @xmath101 mev region , significantly increasing these from the lower end of the mixed phase or from the rhosobar , as seen in ceres .",
    "however , since the invariant dilepton mass comes almost completely from the thermal energy in the new rhic component of dilepton , the @xmath102 distribution should be different from those from ceres , a much higher proportion of the new rhic component having high @xmath102 .",
    "our work addresses only the baryon number zero problem , since we use lgs results and we deal only with mesons .",

    "[ fig2 ] , depends only weakly on the bare quark mass , only through the @xmath109 term in the trace anomaly of eq .",
    "( [ eqa1 ] ) , which is small compared with the @xmath110 term .",
    "therefore , it is much simpler to study the way in which meson masses drop with temperature by lattice calculations of the soft glue .    of course , for the present paper concerned with @xmath23 the soft glue is absent and",
    "that is why the mesons we calculate have no more scalar masses , and why their energies go to zero at @xmath14 to make continuity with the massless @xmath27 and @xmath51 just below @xmath14 ( the @xmath7 and @xmath1 following suit because of the negligible spin- and isospin - dependence ) .",
    "we have emphasized that our 32 chirally restored mesons give just the number of bosonic degrees of freedom obtained from the measurement of entropy at @xmath14 in lattice calculations .",
    "of course , colored excitations enter not far above @xmath14 , contributing to the entropy which is nearly constant over a substantial increase in temperature .",
    "whereas we refer the reader to shuryak and zahed @xcite to understand this latter point , we wish here to emphasize the utility of having a layer of colorless mesons just at @xmath14 and slightly above .",
    "first of all , the interactions are very strong as emphasized in blr @xcite , and essentially inelastic so that there is no doubt of equilibration , which is necessary in order to define a thermodynamic variable such as temperature .",
    "secondly , how do the mesons know that they can get out of the fireball ( be emitted ) below @xmath14 , whereas they are confined above ? in our scenario they have to go through the colorless layer of mesons at @xmath14 , having deposited their color above @xmath14 as the temperature decreases with expansion of the fireball . in other words , our layer of colorless mesons at @xmath14 is a  color purifier \" .    the way in which the mesons , massless just above @xmath14 , acquire their on - shell mass as they emerge below @xmath14 was only briefly discussed in blr @xcite , mostly for the @xmath7 mesons .",
    "hadrons were not considered and the whole issue of how quantitatively the hadrons go back on shell will require further study .",
    "analysis of the copious rhic data should be useful here .",
