    "the mechanical properties of metals are dominated by the formation and migration energies of defects .",
    "experimentally it is often difficult to measure desired defect properties directly , so it is important to have accurate theoretical approaches to calculate defect properties .",
    "the many - body diffusion quantum monte carlo ( dmc ) approach @xcite is the most accurate method for systems with more than @xmath0 electrons but has not previously been applied to defects in metals . until today",
    ", the most successful quantum mechanics - based defect calculations in metals use density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "however , the approximate functionals used ( i ) lack sufficient specific and universal accuracy , ( ii ) can not be systematically improved , and ( iii ) there are now many approximate functionals to choose from , all giving different results .",
    "thus , dmc results are an ideal candidate to wholly replace dft when benchmark thermodynamic properties are required",
    ". furthermore , the relative energies of reference phases ( bulk metals and compounds ) would be of great value in thermodynamic databases and in the subsequent prediction of phase diagrams ( e.g. calphad and thermocalc ) .    in semiconductors , dmc calculations of the formation energies of point defects and surface energies",
    "have shown that important corrections to dft arise when electronic correlations are fully taken into account .",
    "deviations in formation energies of more than 1 ev were found in silicon @xcite and diamond @xcite .",
    "additionally , activation energies of common chemical reactions obtained by dft methods have been shown to differ substantially from benchmark diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) values @xcite and quantum chemical results . for metallic systems ,",
    "the size of the errors in dft calculations of defects is largely unknown , as more accurate benchmark calculations do not currently exist .",
    "it is highly desirable to demonstrate the feasibility of dmc , with its increased predictive accuracy , as a replacement of dft for challenging systems such as metals , particularly as computer power increases .",
    "aluminum is an ideal starting point for carrying out initial dmc calculations of defects since it is one of the simplest metals with a close - packed fcc structure that contains no 3d electrons . as a result",
    "it is considered a prototype material for testing the validity of theoretical calculations .",
    "aluminum is well characterized experimentally so there is an abundance of data available .",
    "there have been previous quantum monte carlo calculations of the bulk properties of aluminum , however , these were done using the less accurate variational monte carlo @xcite and the calculations had large statistical noise .    in this paper , we report well converged results for the bulk properties of fcc aluminum using dmc . we explore a larger range of volumes in order to compare the ground - state equation of state calculated with dft .",
    "our dmc calculations of the defect properties of aluminum include the simplest point defect , the vacancy for which numerous dft @xcite and experimental results @xcite are available .",
    "we compute the nearest - neighbor divacancy binding energy , a defect that dft calculations @xcite have found to be unstable .",
    "since this instability is counter to both experimental studies @xcite and simple bond counting arguments@xcite it is important to perform calculations of this defect with dmc , a method that unlike dft , does not rely on approximations for exchange and correlation .",
    "we also examine two other types of defects : first , self - interstitials can arise due to irradiation with energetic particles , through plastic deformation , or through their production in thermal equilibrium at high temperatures .",
    "we have obtained dmc results for the formation energies of the @xmath1-dumbbell , the octahedral , and the tetrahedral self - interstitials .",
    "second , experimental studies of irradiated aluminum show the presence of he bubbles @xcite .",
    "the formation and growth of helium bubbles can alter a material s mechanical properties through void swelling , embrittlement , and surface blistering @xcite .",
    "since irradiation , through he implantation or transmutation , gives rise to he atoms at substitutional or interstitial lattice sites , the energetics of these types of defects are important .",
    "presented here are dmc calculated formation energies for he at the substitutional , octahedral and the tetrahedral interstitial sites , which are compared with previous dft calculations @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that twist - averaged boundary conditions offer far superior statistics over dft calculated single - particle finite - size corrections for dmc calculations of defects , and also remove a dependence on data from other methods .",
    "overall the calculations reported here used several million processor hours , which is affordable on large computer clusters and supercomputers .",
    "the dmc approach @xcite is a stochastic method for evolving a wave function using the imaginary - time schrdinger equation . in principle , and in contrast to most electronic structure methods , the systematic errors can be measured and systematically reduced @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the most significant sources of error are ( i ) the fixed - node and fixed - phase approximations , a variational solution to the fermion sign problem , ( ii ) adequately sampling the brillouin zone , which in contrast with insulators is a significant problem in metals , and ( iii ) pseudopotential error and corresponding locality error ( although these may be avoided through all - electron calculations @xcite ) .    for our dmc calculations we used the casino code @xcite , with guiding wave functions formed by a product of slater determinants for up and down spin electrons and a jastrow correlation function .",
    "the single - particle orbitals in the determinants were obtained from dft calculations using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation term since it should perform better than the local density approximation ( lda ) where the electron distribution shows large spatial variations as it does at a vacancy in aluminum @xcite .",

    "[ fg : energy_vs_a ] . ) for gga we used the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) form @xcite rather than the perdew - wang-91 ( pw91 ) form @xcite since it gives better values @xcite for the vacancy formation energy .",
    "the dft calculations were performed using the plane - wave pwscf code @xcite with troullier - martins non - local pseudopotentials . for the non - local pseudopotentials we used the locality approximation @xcite in the dmc calculations .",
    "the orbitals were evaluated in dmc via real - space cubic splines @xcite . for the dmc simulations we used 5280 walkers with a time step of 0.01 au , which our test calculations revealed gave time - step errors in table [ energies ] of less than 0.01 ev .",
    "calculations of solids using dmc require finite simulation supercells with periodic boundary conditions imposed on the hamiltonian .",
    "this leads to finite - size effects that can be divided between single - particle and many - body contributions . in a metal",
    "the dmc kinetic energy contains large single - particle contributions due to the sharp fermi surface , which impacts our calculations in two ways .",
    "first , in a real metal the number of orbitals with energies below the fermi level is usually not equal to the number of electrons required in the simulation cell . in dft calculations one can use partial occupations of these orbitals to create a closed shell configuration guaranteeing that the charge density has the correct symmetry . in a dmc calculation with a guiding wave function containing a single determinant for the spin up and for the spin down electrons",
    "the use of partial occupations is not an option .",
    "gaudoin , et .",
    "@xcite found differences in aluminum as large as 0.1 ev / atom in variational monte carlo total energies depending on the occupations of the orbitals at the fermi level .",

    "the red diamonds with error bars are the calculated dmc ground - state energies of bulk fcc aluminum obtained without using twist - averaged boundary conditions .",
    "the dft corrections @xmath2 were added to the results that did not use twist - averaged boundary conditions .",
    "both sets of calculations were done using @xmath3 supercells containing @xmath4 atoms . ]",
    "a second complication for dmc calculations of metals arises as the system size is varied , which can produce band crossings as energy levels pass through the fermi level .",
    "this can create discontinuous changes in the nodal surface of the guiding wave function as the symmetry of the occupied orbitals change , leading to discontinuities in the dmc energy as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : bulk_w_wo_twist ] . for simulation cells containing 64 or 125 atoms we found that single - particle dft corrections @xmath5 were ineffective in removing the large discontinuities we found in calculated dmc energies as the volume was varied .",

    "[ fg : energy_vs_a ] .",
    "the energy points were fit to a quartic and a murnaghan equation of state @xcite .",
    "both fits yielded an equilibrium lattice constant of 4.030(1 )  .",
    "this compares well with the experimental value , 4.022  , with zero - point energy and finite - temperature effects removed @xcite . in contrast dft calculations with the local density approximation ( lda ) and gga ( pbe ) yield 3.960 and 4.046  , respectively .        for the dmc cohesive energy we initially obtained 3.341(1 ) ev using the fixed - nodes defined by the gga orbitals , compared with the experimental value of 3.43 ev with zero - point energy and finite - temperature effects removed , 4.21 ev using lda , and 3.52 ev using gga ( pbe ) .",
    "although the fixed - node dmc results with gga nodes are already the most accurate , to assess the possible nodal error we also performed dmc calculations with twist - averaged boundary conditions and extrapolation to an infinite - sized supercell using optimized backflow wave functions ( with backflow transformations that contained electron - electron , electron - nuclei , and electron - electron - nuclei terms @xcite ) at the optimum lattice constant and also for an isolated atom .",
    "backflow wave functions can be substantially more accurate than single determinant non - backflow wave functions , typically yielding an additional few percent dmc correlation energy in atomic calculations and nearly 100 percent of the correlation energy in the homogeneous electron gas@xcite .",
    "however , since backflow is too expensive to apply routinely , we have used the backflow result , similar to how corrections for all - electrons have been applied @xcite , to shift our single determinant fixed - node energies in fig .",
    "[ fg : energy_vs_a ] .",
    "the backflow cohesive energy is 3.403(1 ) ev .",
    "a complete backflow evaluation of the lattice constant might further reduce the residual differences from experiment .",
    "we expect the backflow correction in metallic systems with atomic number higher than aluminum to be at least as large as our computed correction in aluminum .",
    "this indicates that to obtain cohesive energies to better than 0.1ev  other than by fortuitous error cancellation ",
    "backflow or other nodal optimization must be considered .",

    "the differences between the dmc and gga pressures are not visible .",
    "the solid black curve in the lower part of fig .  [ fg : pressure_plots ] shows the difference in pressures between gga and dmc .",
    "a common procedure for constructing an equation of state of a material at low temperatures is to shift the computed equilibrium lattice constant so that it coincides with the experimental equilibrium lattice constant@xcite . following a similar procedure of shifting the gga calculated energy - volume curve so that the gga equilibrium lattice constant of 4.046  coincides with the dmc equilibrium lattice constant of 4.030(1 )  yields a pressure difference between the gga and the dmc equation of states that increases markedly at smaller atomic volumes as shown in the red dashed line in fig.[fg : pressure_plots ]",
    "this demonstrates that the applying a rigid shift to dft equation of state calculations can result in larger errors than if a shift is not applied .",
    "the results of our calculations of point defects are presented in table [ energies ] .",
    "the atomic positions were taken from complete structure and volume relaxed dft calculations using gga at zero pressure .",

    "previous gga ( pbe ) calculations @xcite of the vacancy formation energy without the `` surface '' correction using 4x4x4 supercells yielded values of 0.61 ev and 0.63 ev with norm - conserving and projector augmented - wave pseudopotentials , respectively .",
