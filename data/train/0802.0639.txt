    "the 2d-wavelet transformation is a useful tool to separate diffuse emission from that of compact sources ( e.g. frick et al .",
    "a comparison of the wavelet - decomposed images of mips ( hinz et al . 2004 ) indicates that the 24 and 70@xmath1 m emission emerge mostly from the compact structures corresponding to star forming and hii regions .",
    "the 160@xmath1 m emission emerges from both compact and extended structures .",
    "the 160@xmath1 m wavelet spectrum ( tabatabaei et al . 2005 , 2007a ) shows an increase when it reaches the scale of complexes of dust and gas clouds of @xmath31 kpc , and a second increase in transition to the large - scale structures of diffuse dust emission .",
    "the 3.6 cm emission from m33 ( tabatabaei et al . , 2007b ) shows better correlations with warm than with cold dust at scales smaller than the width of the spiral arms ( 1.6 kpc ) .",
    "the results were compared before and after subtracting the 11 brightest hii regions .",
    "comparing with the h@xmath2 map , the role of star forming regions in heating the dust , even the cold dust , is generally important at scales up to 4 kpc .    after separating the thermal and nonthermal components of the radio continuum emission ( using the de - extincted h@xmath2 map as a thermal emission template , tabatabaei et al .",

    "thermal radio than the cold dust ",
    "nonthermal radio correlation is proved , but also a stronger warm dust ",
    "nonthermal radio than the cold dust ",
    "nonthermal radio correlation is found ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "it is also found that the cold dust has a better correlation with the thermal than with the nonthermal emission .",
    "nonthermal radio correlation is better at scales between 0.8 and 2kpc , scales including giant molecular clouds , spiral arms , and the central extended region of m33 .",
    "- hii regions influence the ir emission with a strength inversely depending on wavelength : more influence at 24 @xmath1 m and less influence at 160@xmath1 m . + - the nonthermal radio emission correlates well with the thermal radio and h@xmath2 emission out to the scale of the central extended region , 2.5kpc . + - the warm dust ",
    "thermal radio correlation is much stronger than the cold dust ",
    "nonthermal radio correlation at scales smaller than 4 kpc .",
    "+ - at these scales , the role of uv photons from o / b stars in heating the cold dust is more significant than of other energy sources .",
    "+ - the better correlation of the nonthermal emission with the 24@xmath1 m than with the 160@xmath1 m indicates that magnetic field is stronger in the star forming regions . however , there is no indication that the magnetic field is enhanced at scales of the hii complexes .",
