    "any given time the fraction of a galaxy s mass that is in the form of hi will be determined by the competing rates at which it is depleted ( by , for example , star formation , photo - ionisation and expulsion via winds ) and replenished ( by , for example , recombination and accretion from the galaxy s surroundings ) .",
    "these processes are integral to any theory of galaxy formation and so we expect that understanding how the hi properties of galaxies vary with redshift and environment will provide us with important insights into how galaxies form .",
    "our knowledge of hi in galaxies derives from radio observations of the rest - frame 21-cm emission line , which allows us to measure the density , temperature and velocity distribution of hi along our line of sight .",
    "thanks to surveys such as hipass ( hi parkes all - sky survey ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and more recently alfalfa ( arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have a good understanding of the hi properties of galaxies in the low - redshift universe , at @xmath14 .",
    "for example , hipass has revealed that most hi is associated with galaxies and that the galaxy population detected in 21-cm emission is essentially the same as that seen at optical and infrared wavelengths but weighted towards gas - rich systems , which tend to be late - type @xcite .",
    "furthermore , hipass data have allowed accurate measurement of the local hi mass function of galaxies ( the number density of galaxies with a given hi mass per unit comoving volume ) and @xmath15 ( the global hi mass density in units of the present - day critical density @xmath16 ) .",
    "@xcite found that the local hi mass function is well described by a schechter function and they estimated the local cosmic hi mass density to be @xmath17 ( with random and systematic uncertainties at the @xmath18 confidence limit ) , assuming a dimensionless hubble parameter of @xmath19=@xmath20=1 .",

    "* )    in contrast , we know comparatively little about hi in galaxies at higher redshifts ( i.e. @xmath23 ) .",
    "this is because detecting the rest frame 21-cm emission from individual galaxies has required too great a sensitivity for reasonable observing times .",

    "this is precisely the kind of question we can hope to answer with forthcoming hi surveys .",
    "for this reason it is both timely and important to take stock of what theoretical galaxy formation models tell us about how quantities such as @xmath15 and the hi mass function vary with redshift and environment . not only",
    "can such predictions help us to interpret the physical significance of observational data , they can also provide important input into the design of new radio telescopes .",

    "in particular we investigate the redshift variation of the cold gas mass function of galaxies and @xmath30 ( i.e. the cold gas mass density parameter ) in the millennium simulation @xcite .",
    "in addition we convert the predicted cold gas masses to hi masses and we use the resulting hi mass functions , along with predictions for the radii and rotation speeds of galactic discs , to predict the number counts of sources one might expect to recover from hi surveys on a radio telescope with a collecting area of @xmath31/@xmath32/@xmath33 of the full ska .",
    "the secondary aim of this paper is to compare and contrast the predictions of four distinct galaxy formation models from the durham and munich groups .",
    "these models incorporate different treatments of the same physical processes and in some cases invoke distinct physical processes , for example , agn heating versus supernova - driven super - winds .",
    "therefore it is instructive to assess the robustness of the basic predictions and to examine whether or not these predictions are consistent between models .",
    "this addresses the criticism that semi - analytical galaxy formation models lack transparency and the uncertainty as to which predictions are robust and which are sensitive to modest changes in the model parameters .",

    "semi - analytical modelling provides us with the means to study the balance between these phenomena in the context of a universe in which structure in the dark matter grows hierarchically ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",

    "we also consider durham models with different physical ingredients .",
    "to remove one possible source of difference between the models , all the models discussed here adopt the background cosmology used in the millennium simulation ( @xmath36=0.25 , @xmath37=0.75 , @xmath38 = 0.045 , @xmath39=0.9 , @xmath40=0.73 ; cf .",

    "agn heating suppresses the formation of bright , massive galaxies by stopping the cooling flow in their host dark matter haloes , thereby cutting off the supply of cold gas for star formation .",
    "this regulation of the cooling flow results in a sharp break at the bright end of the luminosity function .",
    "bower2006a matches the evolution of the stellar mass function inferred from observations , the number counts and redshift distribution of extremely red objects @xcite and the abundance of luminous red galaxies @xcite * the @xcite model ( hereafter font2008a ) .",

    "importantly , this subhalo is then treated as a satellite at all subsequent times , even if its orbit brings it outside of its host s virial radius at some later time .",
    "in contrast , the munich models simply require that the infalling satellite lies within the virial radius of its host ; if the subhalo s orbit takes it beyond the virial radius , it is no longer classed as a satellite ( john helly , private communication ) .",
    "also , the durham models require that the masses of subhaloes must increase _ monotonically _ with time , whereas the munich models allow a subhalo s mass to either increase and decrease with time .",
    "finally , the durham models explicitly tag subhaloes that are satellites and treat them accordingly , whereas the munich models do not treat subhaloes that host satellites any differently from subhaloes that do not .",

    "bower2006a and font2008a do not consider the superwind channel for reheated gas .",

    "<S> we investigate the predictions of four currently favoured semi - analytical galaxy formation models applied to the millennium simulation for the mass function of cold neutral gas ( atomic and molecular ) in galaxies as a function of redshift , and we use these predictions to construct number counts for the next generation of all - sky neutral atomic hydrogen ( hi ) surveys . despite the different implementations of the physical ingredients of galaxy formation , we find that the model predictions are broadly consistent with one another ; the key differences reflect how the models treat agn feedback and how the timescale for star formation evolves with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the models produce mass functions of cold gas in galaxies that are generally in good agreement with hi surveys at @xmath0=0 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly we find that these mass functions do not evolve significantly with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> adopting a simple conversion factor for cold gas mass to hi mass that we apply to all galaxies at all redshifts , we derive mass functions of hi in galaxies from the predicted mass functions of cold gas , which we use to predict the number counts of sources likely to be detected by hi surveys on next generation radio telescopes such as the square kilometre array and its pathfinders . </S>",
    "<S> we find the number counts peak at @xmath1 galaxies per square degree at @xmath2 0.1/0.2/0.5 for a year long hi hemispheric survey on a 1%/10%/100% ska with a 30 square degree field of view , corresponding to an integration time of 12 hours . on a full ska with a 200 square degree field of view ( equivalent to an integration time of 80 hours ) </S>",
    "<S> the number counts peak at @xmath3 galaxies per square degree at @xmath2 0.6 . </S>",
    "<S> we show also how adopting a conversion factor for cold gas mass to hi mass that varies from galaxy to galaxy impacts on number counts . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we examine how the typical angular sizes of galaxies vary with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> these decline strongly with increasing redshift at @xmath4 and more gently at @xmath5 ; the median angular size varies between @xmath6 and @xmath7 at @xmath0=0.1 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 at @xmath0=1 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 at @xmath0=3 for galaxies with hi masses in excess of @xmath12 , depending on the precise model . taken together , </S>",
    "<S> these results make clear that forthcoming hi surveys will provide important and powerful tests of theoretical galaxy formation models .    </S>",
