    "the de  sitter s 1917 solution of the vacuum einstein equations with a positive cosmological constant @xmath0 , in which freely moving test particles accelerate away from one another , played a crucial role in the acceptance of expanding standard cosmological models at the end of the 1920s @xcite .",
    "it reappeared as the basic arena in steady - state cosmology in the 1950s , and it has been resurrected in cosmology again in the context of inflationary theory since the 1980 s @xcite .",
    "de  sitter spacetime represents the of cosmological models with @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "since de  sitter space shares with minkowski space the property of being maximally symmetric but has a nonvanishing constant positive curvature and nontrivial global properties , it has been widely used in numerous works studying the effects of curvature in quantum field theory and particle physics ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for references ) .",
    "recently , its counterpart with a constant negative curvature , anti  de  sitter space , has received much attention again from quantum field and string theorists ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "these three maximally symmetric spacetimes of constant curvature also played a most important role in gaining many valuable insights in mathematical relativity .",
    "for example , both the particle ( cosmological ) horizons and the event horizons for geodesic observers occur in de  sitter spacetime , and the cauchy horizons in anti  de  sitter space ( e.g. ref .",
    "the existence of the past event horizons of the worldlines of sources producing fields on de  sitter background is of crucial significance for the structure of the fields .    the existence of the particle and event horizons is intimately related to the fact that de  sitter spacetime has , in contrast with minkowski spacetime , two _ spacelike _ infinities  past and future  at which all timelike and null worldlines start and end @xcite .",
    "since the pioneering work of penrose @xcite it has been well known that minkowski , de  sitter , and anti  de  sitter spacetimes , being conformally flat , can be represented as parts of the ( conformally flat ) einstein static universe .",
    "however , the causal structure of these three spaces is globally very different .",
    "the causal character of the conformal boundary @xmath2 to the physical spacetime that represents the endpoints at infinity reached by infinitely extended null geodesics , depends on the sign of @xmath0 . in minkowski space , these are _ null _ hypersurfaces  future and past null infinity , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in de  sitter space , both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are _ spacelike _ ; in anti  de  sitter space the conformal infinity @xmath2 is not the disjoint union of two hypersurfaces , and it is timelike .    towards the end of his 1963 les houches lectures @xcite , penrose discusses briefly the zero rest - mass free fields with spin @xmath5 in cosmological ( not necessarily de  sitter ) backgrounds . at a given point @xmath6 ,",
    "not too far from @xmath4 , say , the field can be expressed as an integral over quantities defined on the intersection of the past null cone of @xmath6 and @xmath4 ( ) plus contributions from sources whose worldlines intersect the past null cone .",
    "however , the concept of at @xmath4 depends on the position of @xmath6 if @xmath4 is spacelike @xcite .",
    "if there should be no incoming radiation at @xmath4 with respect to all , all components of the fields must vanish at @xmath4 .",
    "imagine that spacelike @xmath4 is met by the worldlines of discrete sources",
    ". then there will be points @xmath6 near @xmath4 whose past null cones will not cross the worldlines  see fig .",
    "[ fig : penrose ] . the field at @xmath6 should vanish if an incoming field is absent .",
    "this , however , is not possible since the part of the field of the sources can not vanish there ( as follows from gauss s law ) .",
    "penrose @xcite thus concludes that `` if there is a particle horizon , then purely retarded fields of spin @xmath7 do not exist for general source distributions . '' and advanced fields . ]",
    "( the restriction on @xmath5 follows from the number of arbitrarily specifiable initial data for the field with spin @xmath5  see ref .",
    "penrose also emphasized that the result depends on the definition of advanced and retarded fields , and `` the application of the result to actual physical models is not at all clear cut ... . ''",
    "this observation was reported in a somewhat more detail at the meeting on `` the nature of time '' @xcite , with an appended discussion ( in which , among others , bondi , feynman , and wheeler participated ) but technically it was not developed futher since 1963 . in a much later monograph penrose and rindler",
    "@xcite discuss ( see p.  363 in vol .",
    "ii ) the fact that the radiation field is defined when @xmath2 is spacelike than when it is null , but no comments or references are given there on the absence of    [ fig : penrose ]    one of the purposes of this paper is to study the properties of fields of pointlike sources the de  sitter universe across spacelike @xmath4 .",
    "we thus provide a specific physical model on which penrose s observation can be demonstrated and analyzed .",
    "we assume the sources and their fields to be weak enough so that they do not change the de  sitter background .",
    "in de  sitter space we identify retarded ( advanced ) fields of a source as those which are in general nonvanishing only in the future ( past ) domain of influence of the source . as a consequence , purely retarded ( advanced ) fields have to vanish at the past ( future ) infinity . adopting this definition",
    "we shall see that indeed purely retarded fields produced by pointlike sources can not be smooth or even do not exist .",
    "we find this general conclusion to be true not only for charges ( monopoles and dipoles ) producing electromagnetic fields @xmath8 but , to some degree , also for scalar fields @xmath9 produced by scalar charges .    in general ,",
    "purely retarded fields of monopoles and dipoles become singular on the past horizons ( ) of the particle s worldlines .",
    "a singularity at the particle s creation light cone can be understood similarly to a cauchy horizon instability inside a black hole ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; an observer crossing the creation light cone sees an infinitely long history of the source in a finite interval of proper time . in the scalar field case ( not considered by penrose ) no constraints exist and retarded fields can be constructed .",
    "however , we shall see that the strength of the retarded field ( the gradient of the field ) of a scalar monopole has a @xmath10-function character on the creation light cone so that , for example , its energy - momentum tensor can not be evaluated there . in the electromagnetic case",
    "it is not even possible to construct a purely retarded field of a single monopole  one has to allow additional sources on the creation light cone to find a consistent retarded solution vanishing outside the future domain of influence of the sources .    in both our somewhat different explanation of the nonexistence of purely retarded fields of general sources , and in penrose s original discussion ,",
    "the main cause of difficulties is the spacelike character of @xmath4 and the consequential existence of the past horizons , respectively ,    it was only after we constructed the various types of fields produced by sources on de  sitter background and analyzed their behavior when we noticed penrose s general considerations in ref .",
    "our original motivation has been to understand fields of accelerated sources , and in particular , the electromagnetic field of uniformly accelerated charges in de  sitter spacetime .",
    "the question of electromagnetic field and its radiative properties produced by a charge with hyperbolic motion in minkowski spacetime has perhaps been one of the most discussed of classical electrodynamics if not of all classical physics in the 20th century . here",
    "let us only notice that the december  2000 issue of annals of physics contains the series of three papers ( covering 80 pp . ) by eriksen and grn @xcite , which study in depth and detail various aspects of `` electrodynamics of hyperbolically accelerated charges '' ; the papers also contain many ( though not all ) references on the subject .",
    "the electromagnetic field of a uniformly accelerated charge along the @xmath11 axis , say , is symmetrical not only with respect to the rotations around the axis , but also with respect to the boosts along the axis .",
    "now spacetimes with boost - rotation symmetry play an important role in full general relativity ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "they represent the only explicitly known exact solutions of the einstein vacuum field equations , which describe moving  accelerated singularities or black holes  emitting gravitational waves , and which are asymptotically flat in the sense that they admit global , though not complete , smooth null infinity @xmath4 .",
    "their radiative character is best manifested in a nonvanishing bondi s news function , which is an analog of the radiative part of the poynting vector in electrodynamics .",
    "the general structure of all vacuum boost - rotation symmetric spacetimes with hypersurface orthogonal killing vectors was analyzed in detail in ref .",
    "one of the best known examples is the @xmath12-metric , describing uniformly accelerated black holes attached to conical singularities ( or ) along the axis of symmetry .",
    "there exists also the generalization of the @xmath12-metric including a nonvanishing  @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it has been used to study the pair creation of black holes @xcite ; its interpretation as uniformly accelerating black holes in a de  sitter space has been discussed recently @xcite . however ,",
    "no general framework is available to analyze the whole class of boost - rotation symmetric spacetimes , which are asymptotically approaching a de  sitter ( or anti  de  sitter ) spacetime as it is given in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath13 . before developing such a framework in full general relativity , we wish to gain an understanding of fields produced by ( uniformly ) accelerated sources in a de  sitter background .",
    "this has been our original motivation for this work .",
    "although it has been widely known and used in various contexts that there exists a conformal transformation between de  sitter and minkowski spacetimes , this fact does not seem to be employed for constructing the fields of specific sources . in the following we make use of this conformal relation to find scalar and electromagnetic fields of the scalar and electric charges in de  sitter spacetime .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sc : confinv ]",
    ", we will analyze the behavior of scalar and electromagnetic field equations with source terms under general conformal transformations .",
    "few points contained here appear to be new , like the behavior of scalar sources in a general , @xmath14-dimensional spacetime , but the main purpose of this section is to review results and introduce notation needed in subsequent parts . in section  [ sc : minkdscompact ] , the compactification of minkowski and de  sitter spacetimes and their conformal properties are discussed .",
    "again , all main ideas are known , especially from works of penrose .",
    "but we need the detailed picture of the complete compactification of both spaces and explicit formulas connecting them in various coordinate systems , in order to be able to appropriate motion of the sources and their fields from minkowski into de  sitter spacetime .",
    "the worldlines of uniformly accelerated particles in de  sitter space are defined , found , and their relation to the corresponding worldlines in minkowski space under the conformal mapping is discussed in section  [ sc : pointpart ] . in general , a single worldline in minkowski space gets transformed into two worldlines in de  sitter space .    in section  [ sc :",
    "symfield ] , by using the conformal transformation of simple boosted spherically symmetric fields of sources in minkowski spacetime , we construct the fields of uniformly accelerated monopole sources in de  sitter spacetime .",
    "in particular , with both the scalar and electromagnetic fields , we obtain what we call they are analytic everywhere outside the sources and can be written as a linear combination of retarded and advanced fields from both particles . from the symmetric fields we wish to construct purely retarded fields that are nonvanishing only in the future domain of influence of particles worldlines . for the scalar field , this is accomplished in section  [ sc : sfretfield ] .",
    "we do find the retarded field , but its strength contains a @xmath15-function term located on the particle s past horizon ( creation light cone ) . in section  [ sc : emretfield ] , the retarded electromagnetic fields are analyzed for free ( unaccelerated ) monopoles ( subsection  [ ssc : freemon ] ) , for ( subsection  [ ssc : rigdip ] ) , consisting of two close , uniformly accelerated charges of opposite sign , and for ( subsection  [ ssc : geoddip ] ) , made of two free opposite charges moving along geodesics . in subsection",
    "[ ssc : emconstr ] the role of the constraints , which electromagnetic fields and charges have to satisfy on any spacelike hypersurface , is emphasized .",
    "these constraints in de  sitter space with compact spatial slicings require the total charge to be zero .",
    "as is well known , there can be no net charge in a closed universe ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "however , we find out that the constraints imply even _ local _ conditions on the charge distribution if @xmath4 is spacelike and purely retarded fields are only admitted . in the case of an unaccelerated electromagnetic monopole , we discover that the solution resembling retarded field represents not only the monopole charge but also a spherical shell of charges moving with the velocity of light along the creation light cone of the monopole",
    ". the total charge of the shell is precisely opposite to that of the monopole .",
    "retarded fields of both rigid and geodesic dipoles blow up along the creation light cone since , by restricting ourselves to the fields nonvanishing in the future domain of influence , we the field lines produced by the dipoles into their past horizon ( creation light cone ) .",
    "we do not discuss the radiative character of the fields obtained .",
    "the problem of radiation is not a straightforward issue since the conformal transformation does not map an infinity onto an infinity and , thus , one has to analyze carefully the falloff ( ) of the fields along appropriate null geodesics going to future , respectively , past spacelike infinity .",
    "a detailed discussion of the radiative properties of the solutions found here and of some additional fields will be given in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "a brief discussion in section  [ sc : summary ] concludes the paper .",
    "some details concerning coordinate systems on de  sitter space are relegated to the appendix .",
    "conformal rescaling of metric is given by a common spacetime dependent conformal factor @xmath16 : @xmath17 an equation for a physical field @xmath18 is called conformally invariant if there exists a number   @xmath19 such that @xmath20 solves a field equation with metric @xmath21 , if and only if @xmath18 is a solution of the original equation with metric  @xmath22 .",
    "it is well known ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that ( i ) the wave equation for a scalar field @xmath23 can be generalized in a conformally invariant way to curved @xmath14-dimensional spacetime geometry by a suitable coupling with the scalar curvature @xmath24 , and ( ii ) the vacuum maxwell s equations are conformally invariant in four dimensions with conformal weight @xmath25 of covariant components ( 2-form ) of electromagnetic field @xmath26 , but they fail to be conformally invariant for dimensions @xmath27 .",
    "the behavior of the above equations with sources is not so widely known ( cf .",

    "( d.1)(d.14 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "next , it is easy to demonstrate that in four dimensions maxwell s equations with a source given by a four - current @xmath37 , @xmath38 } = 0 \\quad\\text{or}\\quad \\emf_{\\alpha\\beta}=\\stcnx_\\alpha \\ema_\\beta - \\stcnx_\\beta \\ema_\\alpha\\commae \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] are conformally invariant if the vector potential does not change , so that @xmath39 and the current behaves as follows : @xmath40 since the levi - civita tensor transforms as @xmath41 the following quantities are conformally invariant : @xmath42 therefore , maxwell s equations with a source can be written using the external derivative as @xmath43 where only conformally invariant quantities appear .",
    "the continuity equation for the electromagnetic current is also conformally invariant : @xmath44 thanks to eq .   and the conformal property of the four - dimensional volume element @xmath45 : @xmath46 it is interesting to notice , however , that as a consequence of the invariance of the electromagnetic potential under a conformal rescaling , the lorentz gauge condition is not conformally invariant : @xmath47 implies @xmath48    a remarkable property arises in four - dimensional spacetimes : in both the scalar and electromagnetic case the total charge distributed on a three - dimensional spacelike hypersurface is conformally ( pseudo)invariant . this follows form the conformal invariance of spatial charge distributions .",
    "denoting @xmath49 a future - oriented unit 1-form normal to the hypersurface @xmath50 , we get @xmath51 the three - dimensional volume element is given by @xmath52 , where three - metric @xmath53 is the restriction of the four - metric @xmath54 to the hypersurface @xmath50 .",
    "under the conformal transformation , @xmath55 a charge distribution is defined as a charge density multiplied by this volume element .",
    "hence , the scalar charge distribution reads @xmath56 and @xmath57 we see that it is conformal invariant except for a change of sign if the conformal factor @xmath58 is negative . as seen from eq .  , this fails to be true for @xmath27 . in the following we consider only the case @xmath59 .",

    "@xmath64 is conformally invariant .",

    "since we shall need some details in explicit form when analyzing the character of the fields of sources in de  sitter spacetime and their relation to their counterparts in minkowski spacetime , we shall now discuss the compactification and conformal properties of these spaces .    recall first that flat euclidean plane @xmath68 can be compactified by adding a point at infinity so that the resulting space is a two - sphere @xmath69 with a regular homogenous metric @xmath70 , conformally related to the euclidean metric : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a constant parameter with the dimension of length , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",

    "in this section we shall analyze the electromagnetic fields of free or accelerated charges with monopole and also with a dipole structure .",
    "we shall pay attention to the constraints which the electromagnetic field , in contrast to the scalar field , has to satisfy on any spacelike hypersurface .",
    "let us start with an unaccelerated monopole at rest at the origin of both coordinate systems used , i.e. , at @xmath197 . with @xmath254 , the potential and the field simplify to @xmath255 and @xmath256",

    "it is interesting that , in contrast to the scalar field strength , the electromagnetic field @xmath263 is not singular at @xmath238 .",
    "apparently , the effects of the monopole and the charged shell compensate along @xmath238 in such a way that even the energy - momentum tensor of the field is finite there .",
    "second , if the field @xmath265 , corresponding to the retarded field from the charge @xmath266 at @xmath183 and the outgoing charged shell is superposed with the analogous field corresponding to the advanced field from the charge @xmath267 at @xmath186 and the ingoing charged shell , the fields corresponding to charged shells localized on @xmath238 cancel each other and the field @xmath268 ( eq .  ) with @xmath254 is obtained . the same compensation occurs for two uniformly accelerated charges ( @xmath269 ) considered in section  [ sc : symfield ] , as it follows from the symmetry .",
    "therefore , the symmetric electromagnetic field can be interpreted as arising from the combinations of retarded and advanced potentials due to both charges @xmath184 and @xmath187 in the same way as was the case for the symmetric scalar field ; relation remains true if @xmath23 s are replaced by @xmath270 s .",
    "the appearence of a shell with the total charge exactly opposite to that of the monopole discussed above has deeper reasons .",
    "it is a consequence of the constraints , which any electromagnetic field , and charge distributions have to satisfy on a spatial hypersurface and of the fact that spatial hypersurfaces , including past and future infinities , in de  sitter spacetime , are compact . integrating the constraint equation @xmath271 ( see eq .   for the definition of @xmath64 ) over a compact cauchy hypersurface @xmath50 , we convert the integral of the divergence on the left - hand side to the integral over a which , however , does not exist for a compact @xmath50 .",
    "hence , as it is well known , the total charge on a compact hypersurface ( in any spacetime , not only de  sitter ) must vanish : @xmath272 therefore , the field @xmath263 constructed in represents the monopole field plus the additional source localized on the past horizon of the monopole that leads to the total zero charge .",

    "two of the coordinates are just standard spherical angular coordinates @xmath313 and @xmath314 on the orbits of the killing vectors of spherical symmetry with the homogeneous metric which is @xmath315 in the transformations considered below , these coordinates remain unchanged and thus are not written down .",
    "the axis is fixed by @xmath277 .",
    "next , we have to introduce time and radial coordinates labeling the orbits of spherical symmetry .",
    "the coordinate systems defined below differ only in these time and radial coordinates and , therefore , we essentially work with a two - dimensional system .",
    "radial coordinates commonly take positive values and coordinate systems are degenerate for their value zero .    as discussed in section  [ sc : minkdscompact ] below eq .",
    ", the relations between various regions i  iv of minkowski and de  sitter spaces are conveniently described if we allow radial coordinates to attain negative values .",
    "we adopt the convention that at a fixed time the points symmetrical with respect to the origin of spherical coordinates have the opposite sign of the radial coordinate .",
    "hence , the points with @xmath131 are identical with @xmath133 , analogously for the coordinates @xmath132 introduced below .",
    "let us characterize this convention in more detail .",
    "imagine that on our manifold ( either compactified minkowski space or de  sitter space ) two coordinate maps @xmath316 and @xmath317 are introduced , which for any fixed point are connected by the relations @xmath318 where @xmath319 and @xmath320 .",
    "_ both _ maps cover the _ whole _ spacetime manifold .",
    "now we consider a two - dimensional cut given by @xmath321 , @xmath322 , with @xmath323 , @xmath324 changing .",
    "this represents the history of a half - line @xmath325 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mink ] , illustrated by regions i and iii , say .",
    "the history of a half - line @xmath326 , obtained by the smooth extension of @xmath325 through the origin , illustrated by regions ii and iv , is covered by the coordinates @xmath316 with the _ same _ angular coordinates @xmath327 , @xmath328 but @xmath329 ( which , in our convention , is identical to @xmath330 , @xmath331 , @xmath332 ) .    in exactly the same way we may introduce coordinates @xmath333 , with @xmath334 covering regions i and iv in fig .

    "fig : ds ] , whereas @xmath335 cover regions ii and iii . in fig .",
    "[ fig : coord ] , the two - dimensional cuts ( with angular coordinates fixed ) through de  sitter space ( or through the compactified space @xmath78 ) are illustrated .",
    "both regions covered by @xmath334 and by @xmath335 are included ( the right and left parts of the diagrams ) .",
    "however , in the figures , as well as in the main text , we do not write down subscripts `` @xmath336 '' and `` @xmath337 '' at the coordinates , since the sign of the radial coordinate specifies which map is used .",
    "de  sitter spacetime can be covered by coordinates @xmath338 , @xmath136 ( @xmath339 , @xmath340 ) in which the metric has the form @xcite : @xmath341 it is useful to rescale the coordinate @xmath338 to obtain coordinates @xmath342 : @xmath343 in these coordinates , de  sitter space is explicitly seen to be conformal to the part of the einstein static universe .",
    "coordinate lines are drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : coord](b ) .",
    "another coordinate system used in our work are inertial coordinates @xmath122 , @xmath112 of conformally related minkowski space .",
    "we call them coordinates : @xmath344 coordinate lines are drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : coord](c ) .",
    "commonly used are coordinates @xmath143 , @xmath144 , related to the time - like killing vector @xmath199 of de  sitter spacetime : @xmath345 as it is well - known , these coordinates do not cover the whole spacetime but only the domain with @xmath141 and @xmath346 .",
    "the boundary of this domain is the killing horizon .",
    "the coordinate @xmath144 can be extended smoothly to the whole spacetime but it is not unique globally .",
    "it is also useful to rescale coordinate @xmath144 to obtain the coordinates @xmath347 , @xmath348 : @xmath349 coordinate lines for the static coordinates are drawn in fig .",
