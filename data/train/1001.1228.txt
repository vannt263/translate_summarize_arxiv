    "the interplay of quantum mechanics , relativity theory and information theory is a most important topic in the present - day theoretical physics @xcite .",
    "special relativity provokes both important restrictions on the transfer of information between distant systems @xcite and severe changes on the integral structure of physical systems @xcite .",
    "this is mainly because the relativistic effects produce a spatial redistribution of the single - particle density @xmath2 of the corresponding quantum - mechanical states , which substantially alter the spectroscopic and macroscopic properties of the systems .",
    "the quantitative study of the relativistic modification of the spatial extent of the charge density of atomic and molecular systems by information - theoretic means is a widely open field @xcite .",
    "the only works published up to now have calculated the ground - state relativistic effects on hydrogenic @xcite and many - electron neutral atoms @xcite in different settings by use of the renowned standard desviation ( or heisenberg measure ) as well as various information - theoretic measures .    in this paper",
    "we quantify the relativistic effects of the ground and excited states of the spinless single - particle charge spreading by the comparison of the klein - gordon and schrdinger values for three qualitatively different measures : the heisenberg measure @xmath3 $ ] , the shannon entropic power @xmath4 $ ] @xcite and the fisher information @xmath5 $ ] @xcite .",
    "while the heisenberg quantity gives the spreading with respect to the centroid of the charge distribution , the shannon and fisher measures do not refer to any specific point .",
    "the shannon entropic power @xmath6 $ ] , which is essentially given by the exponential of the shannon entropy @xmath7=-\\left < \\textrm{log}\\;\\rho(\\vec{r})\\right>$ ] , measures the total extent to which the distribution is in fact concentrated @xcite .",
    "this quantity has various relevant features .",
    "first , it avoids the dimensionality troubles of @xmath7 $ ] , highligting its physical meaning .",
    "second , it exists when @xmath8 does not .",
    "third , it is finite whenever @xmath8 is .",
    "thus , as a measure of uncertainty the use of the shannon entropic power allows a wider quantitative range of applicability than the heisenberg measure @xcite .",
    "contrary to the shannon and heisenberg measures , which are insensitive to electronic oscillations , ( translationally invariant ) the fisher information @xcite has a locality property because it is a gradient functional of the density , so that it measures the pointwise concentration of the electronic cloud and quantifies its gradient content , providing a quantitative estimation of the oscillatory character of the density .",
    "moreover , the fisher information measures the bias to particular points of the space , i.e. it gives a measure to the local disorder .    to calculate the measures of the charge spreading in a relativistic quantum - mechanical system we have to tackle the problem of the very concept of quantum probability consistent with lorentz covariance .",
    "the general formulation and interpretation of this problem is still a currently discussed issue @xcite . in this work",
    "we avoid this problem following the relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite by restricting ourselves to study the stationary states of a spinless relativistic particle with a negative electric charge in a spherically symmetric coulomb potential @xmath9 , which are the solutions of the relativistic scalar wave equation , usually called the klein - gordon equation @xcite ,    @xmath10 \\psi(\\vec r)= ( - \\hbar^2 c^2 \\nabla^2+m_0 ^ 2c^4 ) \\psi(\\vec r),\\ ] ]    appropriately normalized to the particle charge .",
    "the symbols @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the mass and the relativistic energy eigenvalue , respectively .",
    "we will work in spherical coordinates , taking the ansatz @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the spherical harmonics of order @xmath15 .",
    "then , to highlight the resemblance with the non - relativistic schrdinger equation , we let    @xmath16    @xmath17    and substitute the radial variable @xmath18 by the dimensionless variable @xmath19 through the transformation    @xmath20    so , the radial klein - gordon equation satisfied by @xmath21 can be written in the form @xmath22 u(s)=0,\\ ] ] where we have used the notation @xmath23 being @xmath24 the fine structure constant . the physical solutions corresponding to the bound states ( whose energy eigenvalues fulfill @xmath25 ) require that the radial eigenfunctions @xmath26 vanish both at the origin and at infinity @xcite , so that they have the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the orthonormal laguerre polynomials of degree @xmath29 and parameter @xmath30 .",
    "the energy eigenvalues @xmath31 of the stationary bound states with wavefunctions @xmath32 are known to have the form @xcite @xmath33 the constant @xmath34 is determined not by the normalization of the wavefunction to unity as in the non - relativistic case , but by the charge conservation carried out by @xmath35 to preserve the lorentz invariance @xcite , where the charge density of the negatively charged particle ( e.g. , a @xmath36-meson ; @xmath37 ) is given by @xmath38   |\\psi_{n l m}(\\vec{r } ) |^2.\\ ] ] then , the charge normalization imposes the following restriction on the radial eigenfunctions @xmath39 the substitution of the expression ( [ eq : red ] ) for @xmath40 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : norm ] ) provides the following normalization constant @xmath41^{-1}\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{m_0c^2\\gamma}{\\hbar c } \\frac{1}{(n+l'-l)^2+\\gamma^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used for the second equality the relation @xmath42    let us emphasize that the resulting lorentz - invariant charge density @xmath43 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : densidad ] ) is always ( i.e. for any observer s velocity @xmath44 ) appropriately normalized while the density @xmath45 ( used in @xcite ) is not .",
    "this is numerically illustrated in figure [ fig : norma ] for a pionic atom with nuclear charge @xmath46 in the infinite nuclear mass approximation ( @xmath36 -meson mass=273.132054 a.u . ) .            for completeness",
    "we have plotted in figure [ fig : density ] the radial density of the charge distribution for two diferent states @xmath47 and @xmath48 of a pionic system with nuclear charge @xmath46 in the infinite nuclear mass approximation , respectively .",
    "moreover , we have also made in these figures a comparision with the corresponding schrdinger density functions @xcite .",
    "we observe that the relativistic effects other than spin ( i ) tend to compress the charge towards the origin , and ( ii ) they are most apparent for states @xmath49 .",
    "in this paper we quantify this relativistic charge compression by three different means .",
    "first , in section ii , we compute the ordinary moments or radial expectation values @xmath50 for general @xmath51 states , making emphasis in the heisenberg measure for circular @xmath52 and @xmath49-states @xmath53",
    ". then , in section iii , we study numerically the most relevant charge information - theoretic measures of the system ; namely the shannon entropy and the fisher information .",

    "we observe that both centroid and variance ratios increase very rapidly with n , being the rate of this behaviour much faster for circular than for @xmath49-states .",
    "this indicates that the charge compression provoked by relativity in a given system ( i.e. for fixed @xmath0 ) ( i ) decreases when @xmath1 @xmath74 is increasing for fixed @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "this can also be noticed in figure [ fig : radiovariancel ] , where the two previous ratios have been plotted as a function of @xmath75 for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "then , we have plotted these two ratios in terms of the nuclear charge @xmath0 of the system in figure [ fig : radiovariancez ] for the states @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we find that both the centroid and the variance ratios monotonically decrease as the nuclear charge @xmath0 increases .",
    "moreover , the decreasing rate is much faster for the states @xmath77 , than for the states @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "these two observations illustrate that the relativistic charge compression effect is bigger in heavier systems for a given ( @xmath80)-state .",
    "moreover , we see here again that for a given system it increases both when @xmath1 decreases for fixed @xmath75 and when @xmath75 decreases for fixed @xmath1 . the quantum number @xmath81 does nt affect both ratios because the radial part of the density is not a function of it .    finally , let highlight that in all figures the klein - gordon values tend towards the schrdinger values in the non - relativistic limit of large @xmath1 or small @xmath0 .",
    "here we study numerically the relativistic effects on the charge spreading of pionic systems of hydrogenic type by means of the following information - theoretic measures of the associated charge distribution @xmath82 given by eq ( [ eq : densidad ] ) : the shannon entropy power and the fisher information .",
    "the shannon entropic power of a negatively - charged klein - gordon particle characterized by the charge density @xmath82 is defined by @xcite @xmath83=\\frac{1}{2\\pi e}\\textrm{exp}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}s_{nlm}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the shannon entropy of @xmath82 given by the expectation value of @xmath85 , i. e. @xmath86=-\\int_{\\mathbb{r}^3 } \\rho_{nlm}(\\vec{r})\\ ; \\textrm{log}\\ ; \\rho_{nlm}(\\vec{r } ) d^3 r,\\ ] ] which quantifies the total extent of the charge spreading of the system .",
    "taking into account the above - mentioned ansatz for @xmath87 and eqs .",

    "we should keep in mind that the angular part is the same for both klein - gordon and schrdinger cases .    the fisher information is defined by @xcite @xmath91=\\int_{\\mathbb{r}^3}\\frac{|\\nabla \\rho(\\vec{r } ) |^2}{\\rho(\\vec{r } ) }",
    "d^3 r.\\ ] ] remark that we are not using here the parameter dependent fisher information originally introduced ( and so much used ) by statisticians @xcite , but its translationally invariant form that does not depend on any parameter ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details .",
    "it is worthy to point out that the fisher information is a measure of the gradient content of the charge distribution : so , when @xmath2 has a discontinuity at a certain point , the local slope value drastically changes and the fisher information strongly varies .",
    "this indicates that it is a local quantity in contrast to the heisenberg measure @xmath92 and the shannon entropy @xmath93 ( and its associated power ) , which have a global character because they are powerlike and logarithmic functionals of the density , respectively .    unlike the moment - based quantities discussed in the previous section , these complementary measures",
    "do not depend on a special point , either the origin as the ordinary moments or the centroid as the heisenberg measure .",
    "these quantities , first used by statisticians and electrical engineers and later by quantum physicists , have been shown to be measures of disorder or smoothness of the density @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "let us highlight that the fisher information does not only measure the charge spreading of the system in a complementary and qualitatively different manner as the heisenberg and shannon measures but also it quantifies their oscillatory character , indicating the local charge concentration all over the space @xcite .",
    "the relativistic ( klein - gordon ) and non - relativistic ( schrdinger ) values of the shannon entropic power are numerically discussed and compared in figure [ fig : shannon ] for the pionic system .",
    "therein , on the left , we plot the ratio @xmath94 between these two values as a function of the principal quantum number @xmath1 for the system with nuclear charge @xmath46 .",
    "we notice that the shannon ratio systematically increases when @xmath1 is increasing , approaching to unity for large n , for both circular and @xmath49-states .",
    "moreover , we find that this approach is much faster for circular states , what indicates once more that the relativistic effects are much more important for states s. in addition , on the right of figure [ fig : shannon ] , we show the dependence of the shannon ratio with the nuclear charge @xmath0 for the @xmath77 , @xmath78 ant @xmath79 states . we observe , here again , that the ratio is a decreasing function of @xmath0 for any state , indicating that the relativistic effects are much more important for heavy systems .",
    "moreover , for a given system ( i.e. fixed @xmath0 ) the relativistic effects increase when @xmath1 @xmath74 decreases for fixed @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "the quantum number @xmath81 affects the absolute value of the shannon entropic power but it does nt affect the ratio .",
    "figure [ fig : fisher ] shows the dependence of the ratio of the non - relativistic and relativistic values of the fisher information for various states with @xmath95 on their quantum numbers @xmath96 for the pionic system with @xmath46 ( left graph ) and on the nuclear charge @xmath0 ( right graph ) .",
    "the fisher information for @xmath49-states is not defined because the involved integral diverges .",
    "first we should remark that here , contrary to the previous quantities considered in this work , the schrdinger values are always less than the klein - gordon ones ; this is strongly related to the local character of the fisher information , indicating that the localized internodal charge concentration is always larger in the relativistic case .",
    "second , we observe that for fixed @xmath75 the fisher ratio @xmath97 monotonically increases when @xmath1 is getting bigger , approaching to unity at a rate which grows as @xmath75 is increasing .",
    "third , we find that the fisher ratio decreases for all states in a systematic way as the nuclear charge increases . moreover , for a given @xmath0 value this ratio increases as either the quantum numbers @xmath1 and/or @xmath75 increase .    for completeness",
    ", the behavior of the shannon and fisher ratios in terms of the orbital quantum number @xmath75 for a fixed @xmath1 is more explicitly shown of the left and right graphs , respectively , of figure [ fig : shannonfisherratio ] .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig : fisherm ] , the dependence of the fisher ratio on the magnetic quantum number @xmath81 is studied .",
    "notice that the ratio is bigger when @xmath98 is increasing , indicating that the lower @xmath98 is , the more concentrated is the charge density of the state and the more important are the relativistic effects .",
    "the relativistic charge compression of spinless coulomb particles has been quantitatively investigated by means of the heisenberg , shannon and fisher spreading measures .",
    "these three complementary quantities show that the relativity effects are larger ( i. e. the charge compresses more towards the origin ) for the lower energetic states and when the coulomb strength ( i. e. the nuclear charge @xmath0 ) increases . moreover , a detailed analysis of these quantities on the quantum numbers @xmath96 characterising the physical states of a given system ( i. e. for a fixed @xmath0 ) indicate that the relativistic effects increase when @xmath1 @xmath74 decreases for fixed @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore , the study of the fisher information shows that the relativistic effects also increase when the magnetic quantum number @xmath98 is increasing for fixed @xmath99 .",
