    "facilitating reuse on the semantic web requires support for effectively finding and exploring existing semantic resources such as ontologies or taxonomies . particularly in the biomedical domain , where ontologies are highly specialized , costly and often created collaboratively by large groups of domain experts ,",
    "_ identifying and finding existing semantic vocabularies and terminologies _ is crucial . to support researchers and practitioners in this task ,",
    "the national center for biomedical ontology ( ncbo ) has developed bioportal_the world s most comprehensive online repository of biomedical ontologies _ @xcite .    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : cluster counts ]",
    "in this paper we have analyzed , modeled and clustered the browsing behavior of users on bioportal .",
    "in particular , we have grouped users according to their browsing behavior in section  [ subsec : res : clusters ] and compared how users explore ontologies in section  [ subsec : res : browsing_comparison ] .    * differences in browsing - behavior types . *",
    "we have shown that we were able to obtain multiple , clearly distinguishable browsing - behavior types , when using stationary distribution as input for @xmath2-means .",
    "further , we have calculated the explained variance per cluster to determine the number of browsing - behavior types to investigate .",
    "the manual inspection of the obtained clusters shows that users primarily concentrate on browsing specific classes ( _ class explorers _ and _ specific class browsers _ ) of biomedical ontologies on bioportal .",
    "two strategies of users to explore ontologies involve the exploitation of the ontological hierarchy ( _ ontology tree explorers _ ; if available ) and the search functionality provided by bioportal ( _ search explorers _ ) .",
    "users in the third - largest cluster ( @xmath3)bioportal experts  use advanced functionality , such as the annotator or the recommender , to find classes and explore ontologies .",
    "the comparison of our results with clusters obtained from static page views indicate that the inclusion of information about the dynamic nature of a user s interaction behavior with a website is important . in general , our results indicate that users exhibit a preference to explore and browse the content of the classes of biomedical ontologies .",
    "however , this also indicates that additional efforts are warranted to promote and further enhance and evaluate the utility of the functionality provided by bioportal to explore and find ontologies .",
    "for example , only a small portion of users ( the bioportal experts ) use the mappings between ontologies .    *",
    "differences when exploring ontologies . *",
    "our results indicate that several characteristics of ontologies , such as the hierarchical structure ( or lack thereof ) , can influence how users explore and interact with these semantic vocabularies and terminologies on bioportal .",
    "one particular example of such an ontology is rxnorm , which does not exhibit a structured hierarchy , and is thus not displayed in the class explorer on bioportal .",
    "the only ways to interact with classes of this ontology on the website is to either use the search functionality , which requires prior knowledge about the content of the ontology , or to rely on mappings from other ontologies .",
    "however , this also explains the strong focus of users / visitors of rxnorm to use the search functionality ( _ browse search _ ) to explore , investigate and find classes of this ontology on bioportal ( see figure  [ fig : bp_browsing_comp : rel ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the structural hierarchy of cpt is used by bioportal to visualize the class tree . hence , to explore the ontology",
    ", users can ( and do)aside from searching ( _ browse search _ ) for specific classes  use and explore the hierarchy ( _ browse ontology class tree _ ) to find a specific class .",
    "note that we have only presented the differences in browsing - behavior types for two of more than @xmath0 ontologies ! yet",
    ", we have shown that simple differences ( i.e. , the lack of a class hierarchy ) between projects cause users of bioportal to employ different strategies to find classes or explore the ontological content .",
    "in this paper , we have presented an approach for identifying different types of user behavior in ontology exploration log data using stationary distributions from first order markov chains .",
    "we provide evidence for a total of @xmath4 distinct browsing - behavior types on bioportal and offer an interpretation of their relevance and meaning .",
    "in addition , we cluster ontologies by their user behavior and identify pragmatic commonalities among ontology projects .",
    "our results advance our understanding of the ways in which ontological repositories , such as bioportal , are used and may guide the development of more user - oriented systems for ontology exploration and reuse on the web .    for future work , we are particularly interested in further elaborating the comparison between the browsing behavior of different ontologies on bioportal . in doing that , we might be able to identify commonalities for groups of ontologies that trigger differences in the way users interact with ontologies on bioportal .",
    "understanding the different ways in which semantic structures may influence ontology exploration behavior has the potential to help in the design of bioportal as well as in the development of more effective and more reusable ontologies .",
