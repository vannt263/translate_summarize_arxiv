    "low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies are usually defined as galaxies with b - band central surface brightness @xmath6 mag @xmath7 . the lower central surface brightness of lsb galaxies makes them difficult to detect against the noise of the night sky .",
    "therefore , they are systematically absent in many optical galactic surveys . in recent years ,",
    "improved techniques to detect lsbs have been developed , and the bulk properties of lsbs are now better understood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the space density of lsbs is still a matter of debate .",
    "it has been suggested that lsbs could comprise up to 50% of all galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus could represent a major repository of baryons in the universe .",
    "if so , we may have to reconsider our notions of galaxy formation , as the standard hubble sequence is solely based on high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies .",
    "additionally , all previous galaxy surveys will be considered incomplete , and the luminosity function of the universe and large - scale structure will be affected . consequently , an important goal is to determine the contribution of lsb galaxies to the optical luminosity density ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 of the local universe .",
    "if lsb galaxies are significant baryonic repositories in the local universe , then type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) should be detected in lsb galaxies in addition to hsb galaxies .",
    "a sn ia in a lsb galaxy can have an apparent magnitude much greater than the magnitude of the host galaxy .",
    "therefore , such sne ia provide a way to find otherwise hard - to - detect lsb galaxies . our strategy is to search for sne ia in nearby lsb galaxies by using data from a shallow , all - sky survey ( rather than a pencil - beam survey ) that images the sky on a nightly basis .",
    "note : results contained here - in are based on the explicit assumption that the binary frequency in lsb galaxies is the same as in hsb galaxies .",
    "we used data from the _ northern sky variability survey _ ( nsvs ) , publicly available data @xcite collected by the _ robotic optical transient search experiment _ s rotse - i telescope , an array of four cameras mounted on a common equatorial platform @xcite .",
    "the optics are four cannon 200 mm focal length , f/1.8 , telephoto lenses in fd mounts , which are combined with four apogee instruments ap-10 ccd cameras with thomson 2048 x 2048 14 @xmath11 m imagers .",
    "the pixel width of the ccds is 14.4  @xcite .",
    "each lens has a 64 square degree field of view , so the array covers 256 square degrees .",
    "the rotse - i telescope can detect objects brighter than 15.5 mag @xcite .",
    "images were taken with unfiltered ccd s , but magnitude is calibrated to a modified b - band .",
    "magnitude in the rotse band @xcite is    @xmath12    the main purpose of rotse is to search for an optical counterpart to gamma - ray bursters ( grbs ) . when a grb is detected , the rotse telescopes quickly move and take an image at the position of the grb .",
    "when not imaging grbs , the rotse - i telescope was used to take two images in rapid succession of every visible field each night .",
    "these skypatrols cover the sky north of @xmath13 declination twice nightly , but only the data north of @xmath14 declination was suitable for our purposes .",
    "the data set we used spans a roughly one year period , from may 2000 to april 2001 , though the length of time covered varies by field .",
    "the rotse - i data are useful for detection of type ia supernovae because of the nightly frequency of the skypatrols .",
    "we designed an algorithm to search for sne ia in the rotse skypatrols data by analyzing the shape of the light curve of each of the over 12 million objects in the data set .",
    "the algorithm can detect sne ia that peak at @xmath15 magnitude 14.5 or brighter .",
    "since sne ia have a standard absolute @xmath15 magnitude of approximately -19.45 @xcite , the upper limit of 14.5 ( minus absorption ) defines the volume scanned for each field .    our search is sensitive to type ia supernovae with lsb hosts or without hosts altogether .",
    "a sn ia in an lsb galaxy will have a template light curve shape because the host galaxy s flux is at least a factor of 10 less than the flux of the supernova .",
    "if the galaxy contribution were brighter , the resulting light curve would significantly deviate from the sn ia template curve and the supernova would not be detected by our algorithm .",
    "this is not the case for hsb galaxies , for which light from a supernova would be blended together with a comparable amount of galaxy light due to the large pixel size ( @xmath16 ) of the detector , unless the supernova were well - separated from the galaxy core . using only fields of low absorption ( @xmath17 ) ,",
    "distances out to @xmath18 mpc can be searched .",
    "contamination from types of sne other than ia is not significant because the other types peak at a considerably dimmer magnitude than sne ia and therefore would not appear frequently in the volume probed .      in order to find supernovae in a field , we analyzed the light curves of each object in the field with an automatic filtering program .",
    "the development of this program was based on testing with monte carlo simulations .",
    "the filter was designed to maximize the number of potentially valid supernovae identified and minimize the number of false positives .",
    "the program is composed of the following steps :    \\1 .",
    "the image is trimmed to make the field square and to include only areas of the sky that were well - observed by rotse - i .",
    "this step ensures that each area of the sky is only covered once .",
    "also , individual observations with magnitudes outside the calibrated range , 9.0 to 15.5 magnitude , are discarded .",
    "objects for which there are fewer than 10 observations are discarded because these light curves are too poorly sampled to determine whether or not they are supernovae .",
    "we remove outliers from the light curves by comparing the light curves to actual sne ia light curves given in @xcite .",
    "this step eliminates data points that are most likely due to incorrect calibration .",
    "subsequently stricter criteria are applied to the objects light curves : we discard observations that are @xmath19 magnitude dimmer than the previous observation if the observations are before the maximum and observations that are @xmath19 magnitude brighter than the previous observation if the observations are after maximum ( i.e. , we eliminate observations that drop too much when the light curve is increasing and rise too much when the light curve is decreasing ) .",
    "additionally , the maximum and minimum must occur at least five days apart .",
    "these steps further refine the light curves by removing points that differ from the sn ia light curve template .",
    "points that differ from the entire light curve s mean by more than 3@xmath20 are removed .",
    "this step should not affect sne ia light curves because these curves have relatively large @xmath20 .",
    "\\6 . if the modified light curve has less than 10 observations , the object is discarded .",
    "a series of filters is applied to the modified light curve .",
    "these filters require the curve to vary with time in a manner consistent with typical sne ia light curves , taken from @xcite .",
    "specifically , there must be at least one magnitude variation over the entire curve .",
    "we require all objects with light curves that peak below 12th magnitude to be visible for less than 150 days .",
    "all objects that peak between 12th and 9th magnitude must show at least 2 magnitudes variation .",
    "these filters eliminate most long - term variable stars .",
    "the filters described above yielded a set of possible sne ia for each field , which were subsequently examined by eye .",
    "the number of possible sne ia per field ranged from zero to hundreds , varying directly with galactic latitude and inversely with the time coverage of the field .",
    "simbad was used to determine if there are any known objects within the error box ( 15  ) of the position of each possible sn ia , in which case , the object is discarded .",
    "otherwise , the digitized sky survey ( dss ) was used to obtain images of the sky near the possible sn ia position . if there is an object visible in the images at the position of the possible sn ia , it is unlikely that the object is an sn ia in an lsb galaxy , since no supernovae that appeared during the rotse epoch would also appear during the epochs of the dss images .",
    "in order to test the efficacy of the filter , we generated a set of @xmath21 synthetic sne ia light curves for each rotse field .",
    "the synthetic light curves have observations only for days that the actual field was observed , and the errors of a synthetic observation are randomly selected from the errors of actual observations with similar magnitude .",
    "the distribution of peak apparent magnitudes of the simulated sne ia is determined by assuming that all the simulated supernovae peak at absolute magnitude -19.45 and are distributed randomly throughout the field volume .",
    "a sn ia template light curve in the rotse band , created using v - band data from hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , b - band data from @xcite , and equation [ eq : rotse ] , is shown in figure [ fig : template ] .",
    "monte carlo simulations were used to generate sne ia light curves from this template .",
    "an example of a sn ia light curve ( peak magnitude 13.59 ) generated by the monte carlo simulation program is shown in figure [ fig : simulated ] .",
    "we ran our filter program on each set of simulated sne ia , examined the results by eye , and recorded the percent identified as possible sne ia as the detection rate . for each field ,",
    "the detection rate was multiplied by the total volume of space scanned and the total time the field was observed to obtain the effective detection region ( i.e. , the spatial volume and time period in which 100% of the sne ia peaking in the region would be detected ) . dividing the sum of the effective detection regions for all the fields by the number of sne ia found yields an upper limit on the sne ia ( sne mpc@xmath22 century@xmath23 ) rate for lsb galaxies .",
    "the monte carlo simulations determined that the filtering program had a detection rate of 50 - 90% for most fields .",
    "the rate was nearly 100% for simulated sne ia peaking at 12th magnitude or higher but was significantly less for sne ia peaking below 12th magnitude .",
    "a plot of detection rate versus magnitude for a field with total detection rate of 66% is given in figure [ fig : rate ] .",
    "the detection rate is intrinsically tied to the distribution of sne ia with respect to magnitude .",
    "an example of this distribution for @xmath21 sne ia generated by the monte carlo simulation is given in figure [ fig : occurrence ] .",
    "in the simulation , all sne ia peak at an absolute magnitude of -19.45 , so the apparent magnitude of a supernova immediately yields the distance to the supernova .",
    "the probability of detection of a sn ia is directly proportional to volume scanned , so sne ia are preferentially observed at fainter magnitudes .",
    "accordingly , the total detection rate is dominated by the lower detection rates for sne ia that peak below 12th magnitude .",
    "we tested the filtering program to determine if it could identify any previously known sne ia in the data set .",
    "the international astronomical union s list of supernovae was searched for all sne ia that meet the following requirements : the sn ia was observable during the time period and area of sky for which we have data ( roughly from may 2000 to april 2001 and north of 0@xmath24 declination ) ; it was bright enough ( magnitude @xmath25 ) to be detected by rotse - i ; and it was located further than @xmath26 arcseconds ( 2 pixels ) from the host galaxy s center . if the sn ia was too close to the galaxy , the light curve will not resemble the sn ia template , and our filtering program is not designed to detect such objects .",
    "the only sn ia found that met all three criteria was sn 2001v , which reached maximum light on march 5 , 2001 , with b magnitude 14.64 @xcite .",
    "sn 2001v was located 64.6 arcseconds ( @xmath27 pixel widths ) from its host galaxy , ngc 3987 , a type sb spiral with b - band magnitude 14.4 @xcite .",
    "the position of sn 2001v was imaged frequently by rotse - i in late february and early march , so the sn ia should be observed in the data , though only for a short time .",
    "the filtering program did not identify a possible sn ia at the position of sn 2001v .",
    "this is expected because the filter can only detect supernovae that peak at magnitude 14.5 or brighter .",
    "sn 2001v peaked at 14.64 , so it is not possible to detect this supernova with the filtering program .",
    "we checked to see if sn 2001v is in the original data set by searching for all objects observed by rotse - i near the position of sn 2001v .",
    "a few objects were found within an arcminute of sn 2001v , but they are not likely to be sn 2001v because they are a few magnitudes brighter than the supernova and show little variation .",
    "sn 2001v was brighter than magnitude 15.5 for only @xmath28 days @xcite , so the supernova may not be in the original data set .",
    "thus the check for known sne ia is not possible , as no good candidates exist .",
    "the search algorithm yielded many objects for subsequent analysis , but none are confirmed sne ia . many of the objects are known variable stars , and the others correspond to an object visible on the dss . therefore , we conclude that each candidate is a variable star .",
    "the search program is effective because many known ( and possibly many unknown ) variable stars were found , and some of these objects have light curves that very closely resemble the sn ia template .",
    "the monte carlo simulations indicate that over half of the simulated sn ia peaking during observation of a field were detected .",
    "since the filter is effective and detection rates were calculated , finding zero sne ia outside hsb galaxies is significant and can be used to place limits on the prevalence of lsb galaxies and displaced stars .",
    "upper limits on the number of sne ia in lsb galaxies in the data set were determined using poisson statistics .",
    "since we observed no sne ia , it was necessary to use single - sided statistics .",
    "there is a 16% chance of observing 0 sne ia in lsb galaxies if the expected value is 1.84 sne ia , so @xmath29 sne ia is the single - sided @xmath30 confidence limit . similarly , there is a 5% chance of observing 0 sne ia in lsb galaxies if the expected value is 3.00 , so the 95% confidence limit is 3.00 sne ia .    for each field , the product of the detection rate ( from the monte carlo simulations ) and the total space and time searched yields an effective detection region .",
    "summing this over all fields gives the total effective detection region ( @xmath31 mpc@xmath32 days ) .",
    "we assume that sne ia occur at the same rate ( number of sne ia per @xmath33 ) in lsbs as is observed in the local universe .",
    "one objection to this assumption is that lsb galaxies may have binary fractions and/or star formation rates that differ significantly from those of hsb galaxies .",
    "however , binary formation is a local process @xcite , so , even though lsbs may have lower star formation rates than hsbs @xcite , the low stellar density of lsb galaxies will not affect the binary fraction . though it was originally thought that lsbs are generally bluer than hsbs @xcite , the ccd survey of @xcite found lsbs with colors ranging from very blue to very red , suggesting that the previous lack of red lsbs was due to a selection effect .",
    "thus the stellar population of lsbs is likely similar to that of hsbs , which also suggests that the sn ia rates are similar .",
    "furthermore , the hsb type ia supernova rate can be divided into a contribution from old progenitors and a contribution from young progenitors @xcite .",
    "the old progenitor contribution is independent of the star formation rate and accounts for most of the sne ia in ellipticals , 50 percent in s0a / b , 20 percent in sbc / d , and a few percent in irregulars .",
    "this contribution should also be present in lsbs .",
    "the young progenitor contribution is proportional to the sfr , and thus may be less important in lsbs . therefore the sn ia rate may be less in lsbs than hsbs , but not significantly less in ellipticals and early - type spirals . though the assumption that the sn ia rate in lsbs is the same as that in hsbs is reasonable , it is still an assumption , and it may be modified as supernovae in lsbs",
    "are studied further .",
    "@xcite determine that the sn ia rate in hsb galaxies is @xmath34 sne century@xmath35 , so a lower limit on the sn ia rate of @xmath36 sne century@xmath23 @xmath37 is adopted . dividing the upper limits on the sn ia rate per volume in lsb galaxies by the lower limit on the sn ia rate per mass @xcite yields upper limits on the contribution of lsbs to the optical luminosity density of the local universe .",
    "we have calculated a mean lsb baryonic mass - to - light ratio of 2.20 ( solar units ) from the results of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . from the data of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , we calculate a mean lsb dynamical mass - to - light ratio of 20.21 . note that the dynamical ratio is less certain than the baryonic ratio because the number of lsbs with calculated baryonic mass - to - light ratios is much greater than the number of lsbs with calculated dynamical mass - to - light ratios .",
    "we have used these typical mass - to - light ratios to set upper limits on the contribution of lsbs to @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the results of the calculations are listed in table  [ tab : limits ] .",
    "the optical luminosity density , @xmath8 , of hsb galaxies is @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "s@xmath23 @xmath23 @xcite is used . ]",
    "the @xmath30 and 95% confidence upper limits on the optical luminosity density of lsbs are slightly above the hsb value , so lsbs and displaced stars contribute no more than an amount comparable to hsbs to the optical luminosity density of the local universe .",
    "we set upper limits on the contribution of lsbs to the mean @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the local universe ( table [ tab : limits ] ) .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath9 for lsbs indicates that lsbs can not increase the currently observed mean value of @xmath9 in the universe by more than 9 percent because @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "therefore , lsbs are not significant baryonic repositories in the local universe .",
    "lsbs can not increase the value of the mean @xmath10 in the universe by more than 13 percent because @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "thus lsbs can not account for a significant component of the total dark matter in the universe .",
    "no supernovae were found in lsb galaxies ( or outside known galaxies ) , and this result was used to set an upper limit on the optical luminosity density of lsbs and displaced stars in the local universe .",
    "this also constrains the contribution of lsbs to @xmath9 and @xmath10 to be less than 9% and 13% , respectively .",
    "therefore , lsbs do not account for a significant amount of missing baryons or dark matter .",
    "@xcite conducted an optical survey using the advanced plate measuring ( apm ) system at cambridge and calculated the luminosity function for lsb galaxies in the survey .",
    "they found that lsbs contribute approximately 30% to the field galaxy luminosity density .",
    "this agrees with our result that lsbs can contribute roughly no more than hsbs to the luminosity density .",
    "@xcite conducted a blind strip survey of hi - selected galaxies in the 21-cm line . since the survey was hi - selected , it avoided optical selection effects but only included gas - rich galaxies .",
    "they found no lsbs with central surface brightness @xmath41 mag arcsec@xmath42 .",
    "@xcite concluded that gas - rich lsbs ( defined as @xmath43 mag arcsec@xmath42 ) contribute no more than 5 @xmath44 2% to the optical luminosity of the universe and no more than 11% to @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite conducted a volume - limited sample of 47 galaxies from the hubble deep field to find the local @xmath45 bivariate brightness distribution .",
    "driver  ( 1999 ) found that lsbs ( @xmath46 ) contribute 7 @xmath44 4% to the optical luminosity density and 12 @xmath44 6% to @xmath10 .",
    "note that our upper limit on @xmath10 is in good agreement with both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "studies of intracluster starlight provide an indirect probe of the contribution of lsbs and displaced stars to the optical luminosity density of clusters .",
    "@xcite conducted a survey for intracluster planetary nebulae ( pn ) in the virgo cluster .",
    "they detected pn by comparing sums of on - band images to sums of off - band images and picking point sources that were only visible in [ o iii ] .",
    "@xcite found that intracluster starlight accounts for between 22 and 61 percent of the optical luminosity density of the cluster .",
    "this result agrees with what has been found in the local universe even though tidal disruption is more common in clusters than in the field .",
    "various authors have searched for lsbs in the coma cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they have found numerous lsbs in the core of the cluster , but the lsbs are only a minor fraction of the luminosity density of the cluster .",
    "@xcite did a deep ccd integration of a region in the core of the coma cluster and determined that lsbs contribute about @xmath47 of the luminosity of the cluster .",
    "it is encouraging that numerous different methods of studying the contributions of lsbs to the optical luminosity density and @xmath10 yield consistent results , both for the local universe and for clusters .",
    "these results all point to the conclusion that lsbs do not account for a significant amount of matter .",
    "we would like to thank the rotse team , with special thanks to tim mckay and carl akerlof , for allowing us access to their skypatrol data .",
