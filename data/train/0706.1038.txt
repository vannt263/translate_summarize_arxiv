    "discrimination of the binary phase shift keyed ( bpsk ) coherent states @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 with the minimum error is one of the most fundamental issues in optical communication and quantum signal detection theory .",
    "coherent communication theory has been developed based on semiclassical theory where these signals are detected by homodyne measurement .",
    "for the signals with equal prior probabilities , the average error probability is given by @xmath3/2 $ ] .",
    "this is often called the shot noise limit or the homodyne limit , falling short of the conventional error free criterion ( @xmath4 ) when @xmath5 .",
    "it is , however , well known that the quantum optimal receiver can largely surpass the homodyne limit .",
    "the optimal measurement is mathematically given by a two - dimensional projection measurement and it attains the minimum error probability of @xmath6 which is called the helstrom bound @xcite .",
    "kennedy proposed a simple near - optimal receiver using a coherent local oscillator ( lo ) and photon counting @xcite .",
    "its error rate is only twice larger than the helstrom bound and is smaller than the homodyne limit when @xmath7 .",
    "dolinar then extended this ` kennedy receiver ' to the optimal one by introducing the adaptive electrical feedback which is enough faster than the optical signal pulse width @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "although the dolinar s concept has been demonstrated recently @xcite , it is still challenging to experimentally beat the homodyne limit with this approach because of its complicated system .    from a quantum mechanical point of view",
    ", homodyne measurement belongs to the class of gaussian operations , i.e. described by up to the second order nonlinearity , while photon counting is the non - gaussian one .",
    "the role of gaussian operations in quantum information protocols @xcite or quantum state estimation @xcite have been widely investigated . on the other hand",
    ", it has also been shown that some of the important protocols can not be performed by only gaussian operations and classical communication ( gocc ) and inevitably requires non - gaussian operations , e.g. quantum computing @xcite , entanglement distillation of gaussian states @xcite , and the optimal cloning of coherent states @xcite .    in this paper , we first show that the homodyne measurement is the best strategy to discriminate the binary coherent states within gocc . to our knowledge , this is the first result addressing the gaussian limit in quantum state discrimination scenario . in the second half of the paper , we propose novel non - gaussian quantum receivers based on the kennedy receiver , that beat the gaussian limit for _ any _ @xmath8 . in particular , we point out that the amount of displacement in the kennedy receiver is not optimal .",
    "our schemes do not require realtime feedback and are simple and practical to experimentally overcome the homodyne limit with current technology .",
    "in this section , we show that `` the minimum error discrimination of a set of two coherent states @xmath9@xmath1@xmath2 with the prior probabilities @xmath10 under gocc is attained by the homodyne detection '' . for simplicity",
    ", @xmath11 is assumed to be real .",
    "gaussian operation is defined as the operation that maps gaussian states to gaussian states . for gaussian input states , properties of gaussian operations",
    "have been well investigated @xcite . in our problem , however , although each signal state is given by a gaussian state , the signal from the receiver s viewpoint is an ensemble of these states , @xmath12@xmath1@xmath13 , i.e. non - gaussian .",
    "this is because the receiver does not know which state he or she is receiving .",
    "we therefore start by revisiting the measurement processes based on gocc .",
    "it is known that any gaussian operation ( gaussian completely positive ( cp ) map ) in optical system can be implemented by adding an ancillary system prepared in gaussian state , applying gaussian unitary operation on the whole system ( implementable via linear optics and squeezing ) , and then discarding and/or performing homodyne measurements on a part of the system @xcite . the cp map including measurements is not always trace - preserving and the output quantum state might be conditioned on the measurement outcome .",
    "when gaussian operations are sequentially applied , the measurement outcomes ( classical information ) are sometimes useful to dynamically renew each step of quantum operations , which is called conditional dynamics . in the following ,",
    "we characterize two types of measurements consisting of gaussian operation with and without conditional dynamics .",
    "the first one is the measurement with only gaussian quantum operation ( without conditional dynamics ) .",
    "here we call it a ` gaussian measurement ' . a generic physical model of the gaussian measurement is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gpovm](a ) , consisting of gaussian unitary operation , gaussian ancillary states , and homodyne detectors . after the gaussian measurement is finished",
    ", a set of measurement outcome is classically post - processed , in our case , to make the decision which signal is detected . throughout this section ,",
    "we consider only ` noise - free ' operations and measurements , that is we assume that ancillary states are always pure and the system is never discarded .",
    "it does not lose generality .",
    "since to discard some of the modes means to lose their information , it is realized by measuring them via homodyne detectors and ignoring the outcomes , where the latter is included in classical post - processing .",
    "mixed ancillary states are provided by first preparing entangled pure states and then discarding a part of them , therefore , can be prepared by pure states and post - processing .",
    "these imply the generality of the noise - free model . a gaussian measurement detecting an @xmath14-mode quantum state is mathematically described by a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is an identity operator ( see appendix for its derivation from the physical model ) .",
    "the operator @xmath19 is a gaussian operator , i.e. its characteristic function is described by @xmath20 $ ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the @xmath23 covariance matrix and the @xmath24-dimensional displacement vector , respectively , and @xmath25 is the transpose operation .",
    "the second one consists of gocc which we call a ` gocc - measurement ' . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gpovm](b ) , its generic model is described by sequential gaussian operations with conditional dynamics via classical communication .",
    "each step of gaussian operation includes gaussian operation and ancillary states , and a gaussian measurement detecting a part of the system .",
    "the measurement outcomes are applied to modify the following step of gaussian operations in realtime , which is the conditional dynamics via classical communication .",
    "after the whole quantum measurement process is finished , all of the measurement outcomes is used for the classical post - processing . the whole process except the post - processing",
    "is described by a povm @xmath26 with a covariance matrix @xmath27 and a displacement @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 indicates the pattern of which conditional dynamics is applied during the whole process .",
    "again , throughout the section , we restrict the gocc - measurements to be noise - free .",
    "gaussian measurement is well characterized and easily applied to the optimization problem on the state discrimination . on the other hand , although gocc - measurement is also well defined , it is not easy to handle its povm directly . to prove the optimality of the homodyne limit under gocc - measurements ,",
    "therefore , we first show that the optimal gaussian measurement without cc is a homodyne measurement",
    ". then we discuss an important property of the conditional output from a gaussian operation with an input of binary coherent state signals . finally , we prove that even in the gocc - measurement scenario , conditional dynamics is not useful and thus a simple homodyne measurement is optimal .",

    "let us show that @xmath82 can be simultaneously transformed to @xmath55 via gaussian unitary operations .",
    "since each of @xmath83 is a pure state , there exists a symplectic transformation ( i.e. gaussian unitary operation ) @xmath84 such that @xcite @xmath85 where the displacement is also transformed as @xmath86 note that @xmath84 depends only on @xmath87 and thus independent of @xmath51",

    "let this operation be a part of the second step gaussian measurement ( if necesssary , one can add @xmath96 as an ancilla ) .",
