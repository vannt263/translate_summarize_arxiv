    "the question that lies at the core of a mean field theory is : what is the relation between @xmath79 and @xmath80 ?    in order to answer this question we have to appeal to the microscopic description given by the grand partition function for classical particles .",
    "since there is not interaction between different lattice sites , it can be written as @xmath81 with @xmath82 where , for simplicity , we introduced @xmath83 .",
    "we can obtain the equilibrium mean value @xmath84 with @xmath85 and express this result as a function of @xmath86 ( for a given value of @xmath87 ) : @xmath88 .",

    ", we can apply a varying external potential and measure the possible values of @xmath84 .",
    "we will restrict ourself to situations in which @xmath89 is invertible , i.e. , we can write @xmath90 , this precludes the possibility of phase transitions , for which , for a given @xmath86 , there could be more than one value of @xmath84 .    the connection with the description of the previous section , based on the nonlinear fokker - planck equation , is given by the fact that @xmath84 should be equal to @xmath91 in @xmath92 .",
    "then , using , we have @xmath93 in the same way that we considered that the transition probabilities satisfy the detailed balance relation even when the system is out of equilibrium , we can consider that the relation between the mean field potential @xmath79 and the particle concentration that we can derive from the previous equation also holds out of equilibrium .",

    "phenomenological arguments to determine the transition probabilities are usually presented @xcite . without the presence of an external field , the transition probability from @xmath3 to @xmath11",

    "this result is obtained from the expression for the diffusion coefficient using for the mean field potential and @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , in our description based on the @xmath0-dependent energy landscape , the result corresponds to a constant value of @xmath0 equal to 1 . but this is not the only possibility .",
    "for example , for @xmath109 and the same hard core interaction we obtain @xmath110 it is interesting to note that a similar dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the concentration has been obtained for hard spheres in a continuous space ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "more complex expressions of the diffusion coefficient can be obtained if a @xmath0 parameter that depends on the concentration is considered . in all cases the interaction , and the equilibrium solution , is the same .",
