    "understanding when and how the neutral dark universe was re - ionized by the first stars , galaxies , and black holes is a key goal of modern observational cosmology .",
    "the bright uv continuum of high - redshift qsos can be used as a background light source to probe this cosmic re - inonization since it is absorbed by neutral hydrogen .",
    "previously , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* f06 hereafter ) compiled 19 qsos at @xmath6 to find the sudden increase of optical depth ( @xmath7 ) and the length of dark gaps at z@xmath86 , suggesting an approach to the end of the re - ionization .",
    "however , increasing diversity has been observed in the optical depth in various line of sights , suggesting it is important to use a statistically significant sample size to discuss the evolution of optical depth .",
    "the highest redshift qso previously used for absorption analysis , sdssj1148 + 5251 at z=6.42 , had escaping flux detected at z=6.25 @xcite .",
    "this means there is still room for the qso absorption measurement to be a useful probe of the cosmic re - ionization . in this work ,",
    "we observe qso cfhqsj2329 - 0301 at z=6.4 with the keck / deimos spectrograph .",
    "this qso is @xmath92.5 mag fainter than the previously well - studied highest redshift qso sdssj1148 + 5251 at z=6.4 .",
    "therefore , the qso has a few times smaller stromgren sphere ( in radius ) , allowing us to measure optical depth much closer to the qso emission at higher redshift .",
    "we measure the neutral hydrogen absorption in this qso spectra to gain a better understanding of the evolution of the optical depth at high redshift .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we adopt the wmap cosmology : @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "our target is a qso cfhqsj2329 - 0301 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* w07 hereafter ) .",
    "initially the redshift was reported to be z=6.43 based on ly @xmath1 ( w07 ) .",
    "the redshift was later corrected to be z=6.417 based on the mg ii line @xcite because blueward of the ly @xmath1 emission line suffers from heavy absorption from neutral hydrogen .",
    "this is one of the three highest redshift qsos to date , along with sdssj1148 + 5251 at z=6.419 @xcite and cfhqs0210 - 0456 at z=6.438 @xcite .",
    "this qso is known to be in a dense environment surrounded by 7 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) @xcite and to have extended ly @xmath1 emission and continuum @xcite .",
    "characteristics of the target are summarized in table [ tab : targets ] .",
    "we obtained moderate resolution spectra of the qso using keck / deimos @xcite on sep .",
    "12 - 13 , 2010 .",
    "although deimos was used in the multi - slit mode to investigate the environment of the qso , we focus on the qso spectra in this paper .",
    "we used the 830 lines mm@xmath11 grating and the og550 filter with a central wavelength of 8000  .",
    "this setting has a wavelength coverage of 6000  to 10000  with a spectral resolution of @xmath82.5   for 0.75  slit .",
    "the spatial resolution is 0.1185  pixel@xmath11 .",
    "the total integration time was 5.5 hours .",
    "we used the deep2 pipeline @xcite to reduce the data , except the background subtraction , which we did manually to remove ghost features of the 830 grating .",
    "wavelength calibration is based on the henear lamp .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard g191-b2b was observed and used for flux calibration .",
    "[ fig:2d ] shows two - dimensional spectrum of the qso .    at @xmath127500 , many strong sky",
    "oh emission lines are present .",
    "although the deep2 pipeline subtract these sky lines well , the noise level at the exact wavelengths of the sky lines are significantly higher than the other wavelength clear of emission .",
    "therefore , we have masked out these wavelengths of strong sky emissions from the absorption measurement . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d ] , the wavelengths masked out are shown in thin cyan lines .",
    "the green lines at the bottom show the sky spectrum in arbitrary units .",
    "we checked that this procedure only affects our measurements at the few per cent level , and does not change the main conclusion of the paper .",
    "we used double gaussians to fit ly @xmath1 and nv lines .",
    "the double - gaussian model do not fit the observed spectra well due to the heavy absorption blueward of ly@xmath1 and broad natures of both lines .",
    "the best - fit rest - frame equivalent widths are 110@xmath1360 , and 6@xmath131   for ly @xmath1 and nv , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with previously reported values ( w07 ) .",
    "the spectrum shows four strong ly @xmath1 absorptions on the blue - side of the emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1d ] ) .",
    "there also exist absorption lines at 9183 , 9212 , and 9240   with equivalent widths of 1.4 , 1.5 and 2.6 , respectively . because none of the pairs corresponds to different lines of the same system ( such as siii@xmath141260 , siii@xmath141304 , oi@xmath141302 , and cii@xmath141334 ) , the identities of these lines are not clear .",
    "there also is an emission line at 9681 , corresponding to oi line ( 1302.17 ) at z=6.43 .",
    "high redshift qsos can be used as a background light source to investigate the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) at high redshift . in the following subsections ,",
    "we measure average absorption in the ly@xmath1 , ly@xmath2  , and ly@xmath3  forest regions .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      at the same neutral hydrogen density , the optical depth @xmath7 is proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath14 are the oscillator strength and rest - frame wavelength of the transition .",
    "therefore , the @xmath7 of ly@xmath2 is factor of 6.2 smaller than that of ly@xmath1 .",
    "thus , ly@xmath2 can probe into much more neutral hydrogen than ly@xmath1 absorption . in this section",
    "we measure optical depth using ly@xmath2 absorption from the spectra .",
    "we assume the same continuum as was used for ly@xmath1 .",
    "we choose the minimum redshift of ly@xmath2 as 970 , above which it is not affected by ly@xmath3 absorption .",
    "this leaves us the redshift range of @xmath17 .",
    "the ly@xmath2 absorptions overlap with ly@xmath1 absorption from lower redshift .",
    "therefore , the ly@xmath1  absorption has to be corrected in measuring @xmath18 .",
    "we used eq .",
    "( 5 ) of f06 to estimate ly@xmath1 absorption from lower redshift , and corrected the ly@xmath2 transmission measurements .",
    "[ tab : transtau ] shows the results .",
    "they are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ results ] with the blue diamonds .",
    "no flux is detected in ly@xmath2 measurements .",
    "the two measured ly@xmath2  transmissions at @xmath17 are consistent with zero flux within the error .    to convert ly@xmath2 transmission to @xmath19 , one has to consider different optical depths between ly@xmath1  and ly@xmath2  .",
    "the difference depends on the uv background , clumpiness of the igm , its equation of state , and the uniformity of the uv background . according to simulations ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) and empirical measurements ( f06 ) , the @xmath20 conversion is in the range of 2.5 - 2.9 .",
    "the @xmath21 conversion lies in the range of 4.4 - 5.7 . following the discussion in f06 , we use @xmath20=2.25 and @xmath21=4.4 .    fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] shows constraints on the @xmath22 from ly@xmath2  absorption measurements .",
    "note that @xmath7 is converted to ly@xmath1  optical depth in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] . since flux are not detected in both bins , table [ tab : transtau ] shows the lower limit in @xmath22 from the error .",
    "similarly to ly@xmath2  , the ly@xmath3  optical depth is a factor of 17.9 smaller than that of ly@xmath1  , providing us with a chance to probe into more neutral hydrogen .",
    "however , the ly@xmath3  absorption measurement is restricted by the presence of ly@xmath23  absorption at the low - redshift end and the qso flux at the high - redshift end",
    ". therefore , we use a smaller binsize of @xmath24z of 0.06 .",
    "the ly@xmath3  transmission measurements are corrected for overlapping lower redshift ly@xmath1  and ly@xmath2  absorptions using the best - fit power laws to lower redshift data ( eqs . 5 and 6 in f06 ) . the optical depth is converted to the @xmath22 , using @xmath21=4.4 .",
    "the results are in table [ tab : transtau ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] .",
    "the ly@xmath3  transmission has more potential since it has a factor of 17.9 smaller optical depth .",
    "however , the ly@xmath3  absorption measurements are much more challenging .",
    "since the overlapping foreground ly@xmath1  and ly@xmath2  lines absorb @xmath898% of the continuum flux in the wavelength ranges of ly@xmath3  , so we need to measure absorption in the remaining @xmath82% .",
    "errors in continuum determination are also larger since we use the bluer part of the spectrum . by just changing the slope of @xmath25 to @xmath26 ,",
    "we get 10% error in the measurement .",
    "combined with the noise in the spectra , we did not obtain tighter constraints than ly@xmath2  .",
    "the purple crosses in fig . [ fig : tau ] show the lower limit from the measurement error .",
    "it has often been suggested that qsos are an ineffective re - ionization probe because ly@xmath1 absorption saturate at neutral hydrogen fractions of @xmath27 . however",
    "the gunn - peterson optical depths of ly@xmath2 and ly@xmath3 are factors of 6.2 and 17.9 smaller than that of ly@xmath1 .",
    "it has also been suggested that metal lines such as oi can be used to probe into even larger optical depths @xcite . while the dark gap statistic method can also probe into more neutral hydrogen @xcite",
    ", our medium resolution spectrum did not allow us to measure the dark gaps .",
    "although we did not detect any flux at @xmath0 , another z=6.4 qso had a flux detected at z=6.29 with ly@xmath3  ( f06 ) .",
    "therefore , there is room for high - z qsos to be an important re - ionization probe beyond z=6.4 .",
    "also in both figs .",
    "[ fig : trans ] and [ fig : tau ] , @xmath7 and @xmath28 show a significant variation , which suggests the importance of finding more bright qsos at @xmath29 as an end of re - ionization probe .",
    "on - going and future imaging surveys at @xmath30 m such as ukidss , vista , cfhqsir , and panstarrs are expected to find such qsos in the near future .",
    "one of the remaining problems is an uncertainty in continuum determination .",
    "we used a slope of @xmath31 , but @xmath25 and @xmath26 also fit continuum at @xmath129300   well .",
    "variation from these is larger than the errors on the flux , even with our relatively short exposure of a faint qso .",
    "ironically , it is hard to measure intrinsic continuum blueward of ly@xmath1 emission because of the heavy absorption that we aim to measure . to make the matter worse , observations of a larger sample of qsos at lower redshift show a continuum break at 1200@xmath321300 , with a steeper power - laws of @xmath33 at shorter wavelengths @xcite",
    "if there is an evolution , the continuum blueward of high - z qsos remain uncertain .",
    "therefore , the continuum determination is a problem in measuring @xmath7 even if one takes very high s / n spectra .",
    "interpretation of the evolution of @xmath7 is a matter of active debate . at @xmath5 , f06 reported a departure of @xmath7 from the best - fit power law from @xmath34 , arguing that @xmath356 is the end of the reionization , where the universe was not completely ionized .",
    "the average length of dark absorption gap also jumps from @xmath3610 to @xmath1280 comoving mpc at @xmath5 .",
    "our @xmath7 measurements are clearly above the solid line ( fit to the @xmath34 data ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau ] , and thus are consistent with this sudden increase of @xmath7 at @xmath5 . on the other hand , @xcite showed that the probability distribution of ly@xmath1  transmitted flux of qsos at @xmath37 are better fit by lognormal optical depth distributions .",
    "this lognormal fit is consistent with @xmath38 data for no evolution in the hydrogen neutral fraction .",
    "however , w07 pointed out that the lognormal fit does not reproduce the data at @xmath39 .    in either case ,",
    "the large variation in the @xmath7 is the primary reason why determining a more realistic model is difficult .",
    "although our results add @xmath7 measurements at the highest redshift probed by qso absorption , it is clear that we need a statistically significant sample ( @xmath1220 ) of bright qsos in every @xmath40=0.1 at @xmath41 , where @xmath7 quickly increases , to overcome cosmic variation of @xmath7 and more accurately trace the evolution of @xmath7 .",
    "using a deep , medium - resolution keck / deimos spectra of a qso at z=6.4 , we measured neutral hydrogen absorption , and thereby , the optical depth . because our qso is by 2.5 mag fainer than the previously studied qso sdssj1148 + 5251 at z=6.4 , we can investigate absorption much closer to the qso emission , reaching z=6.365 , the highest absorption redshift investigated to date .",
    "our measurement of transmitted flux is consistent with zero at @xmath42 in all ly@xmath1  , ly@xmath2  , and ly@xmath3  measurements .",
    "we obtained a lower limit of @xmath43 .",
    "these results are consistent with strong evolution of the optical depth at @xmath5 .",
