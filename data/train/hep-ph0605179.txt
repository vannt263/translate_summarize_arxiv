    "it is now well accepted that approximately 20% of the matter in the universe is in the form of a new non - baryonic neutral and weakly interacting particle whose microscopic properties have yet to be determined . this material has been termed dark matter .",
    "experimentally , the ratio of the dark matter density , on cosmological scales , to the critical denstiy has been measured within 10% to be @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "given a theory of dark matter , the relic density can be predicted by caculating the particle s annihilation cross sections and integrating the boltzmann equation through decoupling to the present day .",
    "it is interesting to note that if we assume that the dark matter particle annihilates through weak interactions and has a mass on the order of the electroweak scale , we obtain the correct value for the relic density ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this fact has led many theorists to concentrate on weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) models of dark matter .    assuming that dark matter is composed of wimps that are in thermal equilibrium in the early universe , their density today is given approximately by the expression @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the current entropy density of the universe",
    ", @xmath4 is the critical density , @xmath5 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the time of freeze - out , @xmath6 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section and @xmath7 is the ratio of the wimp mass to the freeze - out temperature . for weak scale interactions @xmath8 . from the above value of @xmath9 it is clear that the wimp is non relativistic at the time of freeze - out and for this reason",
    "it has long been supposed that finite temperature effects can be neglected when calculating the annihilation cross section . indeed",
    ", these corrections tend to be suppressed either exponentially , or by several powers of @xmath10 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "however , currently favored models of dark matter can often lie in regions of parameter space where the annihilation cross section is extremely sensitive to small variations in the underlying parameters .",
    "for this reason we consider the issue of finite temperature corrections to the relic density worth revisting .    for definiteness",
    "we consider models of dark matter within the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "dark matter scenarios in the mssm have been discussed by many authors . in paricular ,",
    "the parameter space of a subclass of models - minimal supergravity ( msugra ) - has been extensively mapped out @xcite .",
    "viable msugra models fall roughly into four parameter regions : the bulk region , the focus point region , the coannihilation region and the a - funnel . in the bulk region",
    "the superpartners are all relatively light and the annihilation is dominated by lepton production through p - wave t - channel and s - channel slepton exchange . in the focus point region",
    "the scalar superpartners are very heavy . in this case",
    "the lsp obtains a significant higsino and wino component and the annihilation is dominated by s - channel w and z production .",
    "the coannihilation region is characterized by a nearly degenerate next - to - lightest super partner ( nlsp ) . in this scenario",
    "the nlsp has a finite density during freeze - out and coannihilates with the lsp .",
    "finally , the a - funnel region is characterized by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass of the cp - odd heavy higgs @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the mass of the lsp . in this region of parameter space the wimp annihilations proceed mainly through resonant s - channel @xmath13 exchange .",
    "three of the above regions  the bulk , the coannihilation region and the a funnel  exhibit sensitivity to one or more of the underlying mssm parameters . in the bulk , the s - wave annihilation is helicity suppressed .",
    "the dominant channel is thus p - wave , which is itself suppressed by two powers of the wimp velocity , @xmath15 .",
    "any enhancememt to the helicity breaking masses of the standard model fermions would thus significantly enhance the overall annihilation cross section .",
    "in the a - funnel the wimp annihilation cross section is naturally highly sensitive to the width of the @xmath13 boson . finally , in the coannihilation region the cross section is sensitive to the abundance of the nlsp , which is exponentially dependent on it mass . in all these cases",
    "small corrections due to finite temperature effects have the potential to be significant .",
    "similar issues , in which dark matter annihilation cross sections are tuned by the adjustment of mass differences or particle mixings occur in many other models , both within and outside of the context of supersymmetry .",
    "in this paper we will present specific estimates of the finite temperature effects on the relic denstiy in the scenarios that we have discussed .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ section : thermalfieldtheory ] we review elements of finite temperature field theory relevant to our analysis . in section [ section : masssplitting ]",
    "we calculate the thermal corrections to the abundance of the nlsp at freeze - out in the stau coannihilation region . in section [ section : fermionmasses ]",
    "we analyze the enhancements to the helicity breaking standard model fermion masses and their effect on the relic density . in section [ section : awidth ] we evaluate the thermal corrections to the width of the @xmath13 boson in the a - funnel region .",
    "finally , in section [ section : conclusions ] we review our analysis and present conclusions .",
    "other corrections to relic density predictions stemming from a better understanding of the high temperture environment in the early universe have been suggested .",
    "most recently , hindmarsh and philipsen @xcite have analyzed the deviation of the qcd equation of state from that of an ideal gas .",
    "they found that this effect could lead to measurable a correction to the dark matter abundance .",
    "it is , however , beyond the scope of this paper to discuss these recent developments .",
    "at finite temperatures , field theory calculations must reflect the fact that all correlation functions are thermally averaged .",
    "the expression @xmath16 for the zero temperature vaccum expectation value of an operator must be replaced by @xmath17 where the sum is over a complete set of states .",
    "perturbation theory then leads to a set of corrected feynman rules for s - matrix elements . to a good level of accuracy the corrections to relic density calculations",
    "can be understood through the thermal shift in physical parameters such as the masses and widths of interacting particles .",
    "for this reason we will concentrate on the corrections to the real and imaginary parts of propagators and we do not find it necessary to evaluate general finite temperature green s functions .",
    "two parallel formalisms exist for perturbative calculations at finite temperatures ; the imaginary time formalism ( itf ) which was first introduced by matsubara @xcite incorporates a contour along the imaginary time axis to obtain the thermal average .",
    "this technique is best suited for the calculation of equilibrium properties of hot plasmas but can be extended through analytic continuation to real time correlation functions .",
    "the real time formalism ( rtf ) was developed later by schwinger @xcite , mills @xcite and keldysh @xcite and incorporates dynamics more naturally .",
    "the latter also provides more calculational ease .",
    "it is this technique which we shall utilize in the following .    in the rtf",
    "the degrees of freedom in a theory are doubled .",
    "the new fields do not create or annihilate external particles but may appear in loops .",
    "the new fields do not couple to the physical fields through feynman diagram vertices but rather mix with them through propagators .",
    "it follows that these new fields do not appear at one loop level , and we can ignore them in this analysis .",

    ", we will take the plasma to be comprised solely of light ( @xmath26 gev ) standard model fermions and massless gauge bosons .",
    "we will consistently neglect terms representing interactions with superparticles , heavy gauge bosons and heavy higgs bosons in the thermal plasma .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation since such terms will be exponentially suppressed by the ratio of their mass to the freeze - out temperature .",
    "an often considered scenario for coannihilation involves the stau as the nlsp . in this section",
    "we will analyze the finite temperature corrections to the model .",
    "the annihilation rate is exponentially dependent on the mass splitting between the stau and the lightest superpartner .",
    "thus it is interesting to compute the thermal corrections to this mass splitting .",

    "we have consistently neglected terms that are proportional to the neutralino statistical factor .",
    "a similar expression gives the contribution from the diagrams with virtual charginos .",
    "in the limit of the plasma being populated solely by light sm particles , the neutralino obtains a thermal mass shift from self energy diagrams of the type depicted in fig .",

    "we should better understand the structure of this expression .",
    "the most general form of the 4-component self energy allowed by the majorana nature of the neutralino is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the 4-velocity of the thermal bath . in the approximation that we ignore the helicity flip diagrams , @xmath57 .",
    "then , the dispersion relation , @xmath58 taken at zero momentum , leads to a thermal mass given by the equation @xmath59 examining ( [ eqsnmassfloop ] ) we see the @xmath60 so we can conclude that @xmath61 .",
    "the identity @xmath62 then follows . evaluating this ,",
    "we obtain @xmath63 where here @xmath64 .    using ( [ eqdmstau1 ] ) , ( [ eqdmstau2 ] ) and ( [ eqdmn ] )",
    "we can calculate the correction to the stau - neutralino mass splitting . a typical , well studied , point in the coannihilation region",
    "is given by benchmark point lcc3 which is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "at this point the mass splitting between the stau and the lightest neutralino is approximately 10 gev . in fig .",
    "[ figstaumassshift ] we plot the total shift in this mass splitting , at lcc3 , as a function of temperature . at freeze - out , which occurs at approximately 5 gev , thermal effects account for a fractional correction of about @xmath0 .",
    "the wimp annihilation rate is determined by the relative boltzman factor between the two particles , which is then corrected by @xmath65 we evaluated the effect of the shift in mass splitting on the relic density using the darksusy @xcite package .",
    "we found , as expected , that the change in the relic density prediction is roughly @xmath66",
    "it would seem that a straightforward way for two wimps to annihilate would be by production of fermion pairs through t - channel and u - channel sfermion exchange . for gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking",
    "this is especially true since the lsp is typically almost pure bino and as such does not couple to the higgs boson or to gauge bosons . but s - wave annihilation of neutralinos into fermion - antifermion pairs is helicity suppressed by the square of the ratio of the mass of the fermion to the mass of the lsp @xcite . in the bulk region of the msugra parameter space , this number is on the order of @xmath0 for tau or bottom quark production .",
    "p - wave annihilation is not helicity suppressed but is proportional to two powers of the wimp velocity .",
    "this is typically about @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the helicity suppressed s - wave processes contribute to the annihilation at a percent level .",
    "thermal effects can not on their own give fermions helicity breaking masses but they do have the potential to enhance ( or suppress ) existing mass operators .",
    "the thermal corrections to these operators must vanish as the zero temperature mass becomes small and will thus be proportional to it .",
    "it is possible that the coefficient of proportionality could be large since the sm fermions are light compared to the ambient temperature .",
    "assuming that only the light gauge bosons and sm fermions are thermal , the diagrams contributing to the fermion helicity breaking masses are those depicted in fig .",

    "it is then clear from ( [ eql1 ] ) that the integrand vanishes .",
    "so , we see that at one loop order massless gauge bosons can not enhance the fermion mass operator .",
    "as we will see , all finite coorections will be due to massive particles populating the plasma .",
    "this brings us to the second term in ( [ eqhfphoton ] ) which yields a similar expression that is non zero only for fermions with a non - negligible mass .",
    "thus , we consider only tau and bottom quark production .",
    "for the tau @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 . this integral should be evaluated for on - shell fermions with momentum k on the order of the lsp mass . in the above expression ,",
    "the coefficient of @xmath79 represents the correction to the mass operator .",
    "this term , too , would vanish identically but for the effect of the non - zero fermion masses .",
    "for the tau , this is the full result .",
    "the bottom quark receives another , stronger correction from thermal gluon loops .",
    "these will be equal to the above expression with an addional multiplicative factor of @xmath80 .",
    "for the purpose of this calculations we have considered the lcc1 benchmark point @xcite as a cannonical point in the bulk .",
    "we have evaluated @xmath81 numerically for the bottom and tau .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figbhflipshift ] .",
    "we see that , at freeze - out , the corrections to the fermion mass operators are on the order of @xmath0 and are thus negligible compared to existing theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",
    "in the so called a - funnel region of msugra parameter space , the mass of the cp - odd heavy higgs boson ( @xmath13 ) is roughly equal to twice the mass of the lsp and the wimp annihilation cross section is dominated by resonant s - channel annihilation to @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",

    "it appears that @xmath89 diverges as @xmath44 .",
    "but , in this limit , @xmath90 vanishes completely and the region of integration determined by @xmath91 collapses to a point given by @xmath92 .",
    "this gives a finite result . to evaluate the limit we put the @xmath13 on - shell and set @xmath93",
    "this is a good approximation since @xmath94 is typically on the order of 0.05 .",
    "writing the infinitesimal region of integration explicitely , we have @xmath95 where @xmath96 . finally , evaluating the integral , we obtain @xmath97 the imaginary part of the real - time self energy at zero external momentum is then @xcite @xmath98 @xmath99 there are several points worth noting .",
    "first , the self energy has no imaginary part for @xmath12 less than @xmath100 .",
    "this is expected for the following reason : at zero external momentum the processes that contribute to the boson s decay width are @xmath101 .",
    "the additional processes @xmath102 and @xmath103 , corresponding to landau damping , are kinematically disallowed .",
    "thus , a minimum mass of @xmath104 is required for a decay to take place . instead of a power - law dependence on @xmath105",
    ", the thermal @xmath13 width is supressed by a fermionic statistical factor evaluated at half the @xmath13 mass .",
    "we could have deduced this fact as well by noting , again , that the only relevant process is the one involving the production of a fermion - antifermion pair and its inverse .",
    "these two processes should be accompanied , respectively , by statistical factors @xmath106 and @xmath107 with a relative minus sign between them .",
    "the total statistical factor would then be @xmath108 this is exactly the temperature dependence we obtained in ( [ eqawidth ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ figdgammaa ] we plot the thermal corrections to the a width as a function of temperature .",
    "it is clear that at freeze - out ( @xmath109 gev ) , the thermal effects are completely negligible .",
    "in this paper we have identified several mechanisms which lead to heightened sensitivity of the wimp annihilation cross section , and thus the relic density , to the values of the underlying theory parameters .",
    "we then investigated the consequences of finite temperature effects in regions of parameter space where these mechanisms are important .",
    "we first considered the issue of thermal corrections to parameters to which the relic density is exponentially sensitive , specifically the lsp - nlsp mass splitting in the stau coannihilation region .",
    "we found a thermal correction of about @xmath0 to the mass splitting and a similar correction to the relative boltzmann factor between the stau and the lsp at freeze - out .",
    "this correction is far to small to have any measurable consquenses for current or upcoming relic density observations . in the bulk region we considered the issue of corrections to the standard model fermion masses and the corresponding shifts in helicity",
    "suppressed annihilation cross sections . while the branching ratio for these processes is small , the fermions are light and can thus receive significant mass corrections .",
    "it is the interplay of these two effects which we investigated .",
    "we found that , for a typical point in the msugra bulk , the thermal effects correct the fermionic mass operators by at most a factor of @xmath0 at freeze - out .",
    "finally , we considered thermal corrections to the width of the @xmath13 boson in the a - funnel region .",
    "we found the value of this parameter to be exponentially suppressed by the ratio of the a mass to the freeze - out temperature and we provided a physical interpretation for this result .",
    "although in the specific family of models which we studied all thermal effects are considerably below the detection threshold of any current or planned observation of the relic density , we believe that generically these issues should be considered . for example , in any coannihilation scenario an exponential dependence on a small mass splitting is expected .",
    "similarly , any resonant annihilation will exhibit hightened sensitivity to a small width associated with the virtual particle .",
    "small corrections to these parameters can not a priori be neglected . however , as we have seen , close analysis will often indicate that these effects are very small .",
