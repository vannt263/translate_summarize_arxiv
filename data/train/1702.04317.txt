    "the coupled - cluster ( cc ) method is today the _ de facto _ standard wavefunction - based method for electronic - structure calculations , and has a complex and interesting history @xcite . to cut a long story short ,",
    "it was invented by coester and kmmel in the 1950s as a method for dealing with the strong correlations inside an atomic nucleus @xcite . from nuclear physics ,",
    "the idea migrated to the field of quantum chemistry in the 1960s due to the seminal work of researchers such as sinanolu , ek , paldus and shavitt @xcite .",
    "an interesting turn of events is that the method returned to nuclear physics in the 1990s , when dean and hjorth ",
    "jensen applied the now mature methodology to nuclear structure calculations @xcite .",
    "the main feature of the cc method is the use of an exponential parametrization of the wavefunction .",
    "this ensures proper scaling of the computed energy with system size ( number of particles ) , i.e. , the method is _",
    "size extensive_. at the same time , the cc method is only _ polynomially scaling _ with respect to system size .",
    "these factors have led to the popularity of the method .",
    "however , the theory does not satisfy the ( rayleigh - ritz ) variational principle , i.e. , the computed cc energy is not guaranteed to be an upper bound to the exact energy .",
    "this has traditionally been the main criticism of cc calculations , as an error estimate is not readily available .",
    "furthermore , in the original formulation it was not _",
    "variational _ in the sense that the solution was not formulated as a stationary point of some function(al ) .",
    "helgaker and jrgensen later formulated the cc method in terms of a lagrangian @xcite , viewing the solution of the cc amplitude equations as a constrained optimization of the energy , the set of cluster amplitude equations becoming constraints .",
    "this is today the standard formulation of the cc method .    already in 1983",
    ", arponen @xcite derived the so - called extended cc method ( ecc ) from a generalization of the rayleigh ",
    "ritz variational principle , the _ bivariational principle_. this principle formally relaxes the condition of the hamiltonian being symmetric , and thus introduces the left eigenvector as a variable as well as the right eigenvector .",
    "arponen noted that the standard cc method can be viewed as an approximation to ecc , and continued to write down the standard cc lagrangian . in the bivariational interpretation , helgaker and jrgensen s lagrange multipliers are actually wavefunction parameters on equal footing with the cluster amplitudes .",
    "no distinction is being made .",
    "both helgaker and jrgensen s cc lagrangian and arponen s bivariational formulation cast cc theory in a _ variational _ ( stationary point ) setting .",
    "however , only the bivariational point of view allows , at least formally , systematic improvement by adding other degrees of freedom than the cluster amplitudes to the ansatz .",
    "the bivariational principle is therefore of potential great use when developing novel wavefunction - based methods , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite , where the single - particle functions are introduced as ( bi)variational parameters in a time - dependent setting .",
    "however , while the bivariational principle is rigorous , it is not known how to introduce _ approximations _ by parameterizations of the wavefunctions , such that one can obtain existence and uniqueness results as well as error estimates .    in this article",
    ", we will provide a rigorous analysis of a version of the ecc method .",
    "the idea is , starting from the bivariational quotient , to choose a function @xmath0 ( see eq .  ) that is ( locally and strongly ) monotone and where @xmath1 is equivalent to a critical point of the bivariational quotient . until now",
    ", ecc has not been turned into a practical tool in chemistry due to its complexity . on the other hand ,",
    "the analysis herein is a step towards obtaining a rigorous foundation for the application of the bivariational principle .",
    "we believe that the approach taken , by showing the monotonicity of the flipped gradient @xmath0 , is an approach that may allow existence and uniqueness results in much more general settings .",
    "we build our analysis on articles by rohwedder and schneider , who fairly recently put the standard cc method on sound mathematical ground @xcite .",
    "they proved , among other important results , a uniqueness and existence result of the solution of the cc amplitude equations .",
    "the result rests on a certain monotonicity property of the cc equations .",
    "moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite the boundedness of cluster operators ( as operators on a hilbert space that guarantees finite kinetic energy ) was established , which turns out to be a rather subtle matter .",
    "they also provided error estimates for the energy using the stationarity condition of the lagrangian .",
    "this article is structured as follows : in section [ sec : exp - ansatz ] we discuss the solution of the schrdinger equation by employing an exponential ansatz .",
    "we here present relevant results needed for this work . in particular lemma [ lemma : eccpara ] is the motivation for our choice of ecc variables and links the ecc energy function to the bivariational principle .",
    "theorem [ thm : contecc ] formulates the continuous ecc equations and equates the solution of these equations with the solution of the schrdinger equation .    in section [ class ]",
    "we analyze the flipped gradient of the ecc energy function and prove strong and local monotonicity for this entity .",
    "this is achieved for two complementary situations .",
    "theorem [ thm : taylormono ] proves this property under assumptions on the structure of the solution , whereas theorem [ thm : splittmono ] under assumptions on the hamiltonian . along the lines of the analysis of rohwedder and schneider for the cc theory , we prove existence and uniqueness for the solution of the ( continuous ) ecc equation and truncated ( discrete ) versions of it , see theorem [ uande ] .",
    "this theorem also guarantees convergence towards the full solution as the truncated amplitude spaces tend to the continuous ones .",
    "theorem [ thmest ] formulates a sufficient condition for the truncated amplitude spaces to grant a unique solution of the discrete ecc equation .",
    "again the monotonicity is used for the flipped gradient .",
    "lastly , in theorem [ thm : eest ] we obtain error estimates for the truncated ecc energy .",
    "the energy estimates are obtained without the use of a lagrangian and are instead based on the bivariational formulation of the theory .",
    "in this section we consider the exponential parametrization for the @xmath2-electron ground - state wavefunction @xmath3 satisfying the @xmath2-electron schrdinger equation ( se ) @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the ground - state energy and @xmath6 is the hamiltonian of a molecule in the born  oppenheimer approximation .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 exists and that it is non - degenerate , and we denote by @xmath7 the spectral gap ( for definition see section [ sec : aap ] ) .    the set of admissible wavefunctions is a hilbert space @xmath8 of finite kinetic energy wavefunctions , with norm @xmath9 . here , @xmath10 is the space of totally antisymmetric square - integrable functions @xmath11 , with norm @xmath12 and inner product @xmath13 . in this work ,",
    "we restrict our attention to the _ real _ space @xmath14 , and thus real hamiltonians .",

    "we introduce the convention that to each cluster amplitude sequence @xmath49 , @xmath57 , etc , the corresponding _ cluster operator _ is denoted by the capital letter , i.e. , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , etc .",
    "cluster operators by definition excludes @xmath60 , so unless otherwise specified , in the sequel , all sums over @xmath61 runs over excited determinants only . moreover , we group the excitations according to the number of `` particle - hole pairs '' they create , i.e. , @xmath62 , etc .",
    "we follow ref .",

    "we remark that the space of cluster operators corresponding to amplitudes from @xmath67 only depends on the choice of the reference @xmath33 ( i.e. the space @xmath55 ) , and not on the choice of the virtual orbitals @xmath68 , as long as @xmath38 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath69 .",
    "if the hilbert space was finite dimensional , every linear operator would be bounded , and the exponential map @xmath70 would always be well - defined .",
    "a cornerstone of formal cc theory is therefore the well - definedness of the exponential map for general hilbert spaces and cluster operators ( see lemma 2.3 in @xcite ) :    @xmath71 and @xmath72 are bounded operators on @xmath73 if and only if @xmath74 .",

    "the main tool here is the concept of local strong monotonicity of @xmath105 .",
