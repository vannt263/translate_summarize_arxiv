    "it is an interesting feature of neutrino physics that two of the lepton mixing angles , the atmospheric angle @xmath1 and the solar angle @xmath2 , are both rather large @xcite . until recently the remaining reactor angle , @xmath3 , was unmeasured .",
    "direct evidence for @xmath3 was first provided by t2k , minos and double chooz  @xcite .",
    "recently daya bay  @xcite , reno  @xcite , and double chooz  @xcite collaborations have measured @xmath4 : @xmath5    this measurement excludes the tri - bimaximal ( tb ) lepton mixing pattern@xcite in which the atmospheric angle is maximal , the reactor angle vanishes , and the solar mixing angle is approximately @xmath6 .",
    "when comparing global fits to tb mixing it is convenient to express the solar , atmospheric and reactor angles in terms of deviation parameters ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) from tb mixing@xcite : [ rsadef ] _",
    "12=(1+s ) ,   _ 23=(1+a ) ,   _ 13=. from the global fits in @xcite for illustrative purposes one may consider the representative @xmath10 ranges for the tb deviation parameters : s=-0.030.03 ,  a=-0.10 0.03 ,  r=0.220.01 , [ rsafit ] assuming a normal neutrino mass ordering and a first octant atmospheric mixing angle .",
    "notice that even though these ranges are quoted for the normal hierarchy , the representative ranges for the inverted hierarchy lie within these normal hierarchy ranges when considering a first octant atmospheric mixing angle .",
    "we emphasise that the global fits do not decisively determine the octant for the atmospheric mixing angle . as well as showing that tb is excluded by the reactor angle being non - zero , eq .",
    "( [ rsafit ] ) indicates a preference for the atmospheric angle to be below its maximal value and also a slight preference for the solar angle to be below its tri - maximal value .",
    "it seems that tb mixing no longer holds the exalted position that it did before , and perhaps now is an opportune moment to consider other mixing patterns that have been proposed but which have so far been somewhat eclipsed by tb mixing .",
    "an interesting alternative to tb mixing is the golden ratio ( gr ) @xcite mixing pattern : @xmath11 so named because it involves @xmath12 , the famed golden ratio which ancient greeks thought aesthetically pleasing .",
    "notice that we have reported the above lepton mixing matrix in the particle data group ( pdg ) convention for @xmath13@xcite where @xmath14 is the matrix of majorana phases .",
    "the history of the gr s possible role in lepton mixing began as a footnote@xcite .",
    "several years later , this idea was applied @xcite in the context of a non - diagonal charged lepton basis by observing that @xmath15 was a good leading order ( lo ) prediction for the solar neutrino mixing angle .",
    "in addition to this , ref . @xcite conjectured the possible connection of this prediction to the group @xmath0 . with this in mind , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite sought to elucidate the group theory of @xmath0 and generate the aforementioned prediction for the solar neutrino angle prediction in the context of a non - dynamical flavour model . used in the exploration of ref .",
    "] shortly after this , it was found @xcite that there was another possible prediction for the solar neutrino mixing angle involving the golden ratio , @xmath16 .",
    "but instead of using @xmath0 , the dihedral group @xmath17 was utilised to dynamically generate this prediction . for two years , the idea of the golden ratio s possible implication in neutrino mixing lay seemingly dormant to its double cover , @xmath18 , with their golden ratio prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite in mind . ] , until a dynamical @xmath0 model was constructed @xcite in a basis in which the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal . shortly afterwards",
    ", it was shown @xcite that the prediction of @xmath15 was minimally realised in @xmath0 , when assuming a diagonal charged lepton basis .",
    "yet a group in which the prediction @xmath19 was realised under the same assumptions , could not be found . the same work@xcite also contained two dynamical models which predicted golden ratio mixing .",
    "it should be noted that as all of this work using @xmath0 to construct models which predicted golden ratio lepton mixing was being done , @xmath0 was also being used to construct a four family lepton model@xcite , and its double cover , @xmath18 , to construct a four family model incorporating quarks@xcite .",
    "in addition to this , @xmath18 was used to construct a flavour model explaining cosmic - ray anomalies @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the measurement of the reactor angle also excludes the gr lepton mixing pattern in eq.([ugr ] ) in which the atmospheric angle is maximal , the reactor angle vanishes , and the solar mixing angle is given by @xmath15 , corresponding to @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "these all lie outside the @xmath10 ranges in eq.([rsafit ] ) , especially the reactor parameter @xmath9 , but also the atmospheric deviation parameter @xmath8 , and even the solar parameter @xmath7 is too negative . in the face of this disagreement , we shall interpret the gr prediction as the lo prediction and then try to achieve consistency with the data at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "this is analogous to a recent strategy that was developed for dealing with the tb prediction in the light of a non - zero reactor angle @xcite , where the lo klein symmetry based on the @xmath22 generators @xmath23 was broken at nlo but the generator @xmath24 was preserved in order to maintain the successful tri - maximal solar prediction @xmath25 , leading to an atmospheric sum rule relation @xmath26 .",
    "however , in the present case , since we also wish to correct the solar angle prediction , we do not wish to preserve any of the original lo klein symmetry , and so we shall break both the corresponding @xmath24 and @xmath27 klein subgroup generators of @xmath0 defined in table  [ tab : a5gen ] at nlo . for a general nlo correction , this would imply arbitrary values for the deviation parameters @xmath28 .",
    "however we shall consider a minimal nlo correction leading to restricted and correlated ranges of these parameters .",
    "in the present paper , then , we propose a new @xmath0 model of leptons which corrects the lo prediction of gr mixing via a minimal nlo majorana mass correction that completely breaks the original klein symmetry generators , @xmath24 and @xmath27 , thereby correcting all three mixing angles and allowing agreement to be achieved with the global fits .",
    "although there is no remaining mixing angle sum rule prediction , the minimal nature of the assumed nlo correction leads to a restricted and correlated range of the resulting deviation parameters @xmath28 which encompasses the @xmath10 ranges of these parameters from the recent global fits .",
    "the minimal nlo majorana mass correction also has the feature that it preserves a lo inverse neutrino mass sum rule even at nlo , leading to a quasi - degenerate neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "this , in turn , severely constrains the parameter space of neutrinoless double beta decay , allowing the model to be tested by next generation neutrinoless double beta decay experiments .",
    "the layout of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , the golden lepton flavour model is constructed by defining its fields and transformation properties under @xmath0 as well as an additional @xmath29 symmetry .",
    "the resulting lo and nlo mass matrices are constructed after electroweak and flavour symmetry breaking and diagonalised to reveal the lepton mass and mixing parameters . in section [ sec : alignment ] , the vacuum alignment of the model is analysed by explicit construction and minimisation of the model s flavon potential .",
    "section [ sec : sumruleimp ] contains a detailed analysis of the phenomenological implications of the nlo correction on the tb deviations parameters ( @xmath9 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ) and the effective majorana mass scale of neutrinoless double beta decay . in section [ sec : conclusion ] , the discussion of the @xmath30 model is concluded .",
    "the relevant group theory of @xmath0 can be found in appendix [ sec : appendixa ] and the breaking of the low - energy golden ratio klein symmetry is discussed in appendix [ sec : appendixc ] .",
    "in this section , we present an @xmath0 model of leptons as a framework in which to study the generation of a non - zero @xmath3 from @xmath0 .",
    "we begin this discussion by noting that the left - handed lepton doublets @xmath31 ) , the right - handed charged lepton singlets @xmath32 , and the right - handed neutrinos @xmath33 all transform under the @xmath34-dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the up- and down - type higgs doublet fields @xmath35 and @xmath36 are assumed to be blind to the flavour symmetry . as a result of this minimal field content and",
    "its transformation properties @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are the only allowed terms in the yukawa superpotential because @xmath40 contains a singlet ( see appendix [ sec : appendixa ] for the group theory of @xmath0 ) .",
    "however , these terms lead to undesirable phenomenological predictions , namely degenerate charged lepton and neutrino masses as well as no leptonic mixing .    to fix the problematic predictions of the simplest lo terms ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 )",
    ", it is necessary to introduce additional scalar fields ( _ i.e. _ flavon fields ) which will couple to the existing matter fields , as well as an additional @xmath29 symmetry to forbid problematic operators which lead to un - phenomenological results .",
    "the @xmath29 symmetry will not be gauged , in order to avoid constraints associated with anomaly cancellation .",
    "yet , it will be spontaneously broken by the flavon fields acquiring vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "in general , this will lead to massless goldstone bosons , unless the symmetry is also explicitly broken .",
    "therefore , the @xmath29 symmetry is assumed to be explicitly broken in the hidden sector of the theory , so that that goldstone bosons become pseudo - goldstone bosons with mass around 1 tev .",
    "the additional fields , as well as the original matter fields , and their transformation properties under @xmath30 can be found in table [ tab : matter ] . using these transformation properties , the yukawa operators invariant under the @xmath30 symmetry can be constructed .",
    ".the field content of the @xmath30 model where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are carefully chosen integers .",
    "for example we have checked that @xmath43 and @xmath44 leads to the desired operators with no undesirable operators . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     notice that if _ both _",
    "@xmath24 _ and _ @xmath27 generators are unbroken , such that the klein symmetry exists at low energies , then the only nontrivial alignments that exist are for the @xmath45- and @xmath46-dimensional irreducible representations . the vev which preserves both @xmath22 _ and _",
    "@xmath47 is given by @xmath48 whereas the vev which preserves @xmath49 _ and _ @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 recall that the five dimensional vev given above was crucial in constructing the lo golden model of section [ sec : lomodel ] .",
    "in addition to constructing these invariant vevs the @xmath24 and @xmath52 elements / generators can also be used to calculate the clebsch - gordan coefficients associated with the particular irreducible representations of @xmath0 .",
    "this is the goal of the remainder of this appendix .      from the matrix representations of the @xmath24 and @xmath52 elements / generators of @xmath0 given in the previous section , it is straightforward to calculate the clebsch - gordan coefficients for the decomposition of the product representations , which we now list for this basis in detail .",
    "we use @xmath53 to denote the elements of the first representation , @xmath54 to indicate those of the second representation of the product , and the subscripts  @xmath55 \" and  @xmath56 \" to indicate a representation which is antisymmetric or symmetric , respectively . +     @xmath57    @xmath58       @xmath59",
    "in this appendix we show that the assumed correction to the superpotential ( cf . eq .",
    "( [ eqn : newmaj ] ) ) , @xmath60 is sufficient to completely break the klein symmetry associated with the unsuccessful lo golden ratio prediction .",
    "we begin by first noting that so long as @xmath61 and/or @xmath62 , a non - zero value of @xmath3 will be obtained because a vev proportional to @xmath63 will be preserved by @xmath64 ( cf .",
    "table [ tab : invvev ] ) .",
    "furthermore , by construction , any representation formed from the combination of two triplet fields preserving @xmath65 will preserve said representation s corresponding @xmath27 .",
    "for example , the @xmath46 constructed from two @xmath66 fields where the @xmath53 are left arbitrary is @xmath67 in the above result , the subscript `` @xmath68 '' on @xmath69 denotes that we are selecting the @xmath68 from the tensor product @xmath70 . from the form of @xmath71 given in table [ tab : a5gen ] , it is clear to see that only two solutions exist which leave @xmath50 invariant ( _ i.e. _ satisfy @xmath72 ) : @xmath73 from these two solutions , the latter may be interpreted as resulting from general invariance of a vev acted upon by @xmath71 and the former existing because the @xmath68 was constructed from _ two _ @xmath34- dimensional irreducible representations . in either case , the assumed vev of @xmath74 breaks @xmath65 and the corresponding @xmath75 breaks @xmath50 providing a correction to the problematic vanishing reactor mixing angle .",
    "next , we turn to the invariance of @xmath75 under the @xmath24 generator . from the form of @xmath76 ( cf .",
    "table [ tab : a5gen ] ) ,    it is straightforward to see a @xmath77 is left unchanged by the action of @xmath78 ( cf .",
    "table [ tab : invvev ] ) .",
    "this , in turn , implies the conditions for the invariance of a triplet vev under the @xmath34- dimensional @xmath24 generator : @xmath79 then , acting @xmath49 ( cf . table [ tab : a5gen ] ) on @xmath80 implies @xmath49 is preserved by the @xmath80 vevs constructed from @xmath81 notice that the first two solutions preserve @xmath78 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "the final two alignments preserve @xmath49 ( when it acts on their corresponding @xmath80 contraction ) . from these @xmath24-preserving alignments",
    "it is easy to see @xmath74 will also break the @xmath24 generator .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to see that , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is impossible to preserve both @xmath78 and @xmath65 simultaneously by any vev given to a flavon field transforming under the @xmath34-dimensional irreducible representation .",
    "however , this is exactly what is needed to correct the problematic predictions of lo golden ratio mixing given in eq .",
