    "granular systems have been extensively studied due both to the theoretical challenges they present ( for a recent review see  @xcite ) and to the applications of industrial importance that spring from the rich phenomena they exhibit ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these systems are characterized by an energy loss in collisions .",
    "this loss is at the base of many interesting phenomena , such as inelastic collapse@xcite , where the particles collide infinitely often in finite time , and clustering ( for a sample of theoretical , simulational , and experimental approaches see  @xcite ) .",
    "different methods for keeping the system from collapsing have been devised , such as subjecting the particles to brownian forces@xcite , and forcing through the boundaries by putting the system in a box with one or more thermal - like walls ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "this work focuses on the latter method .",
    "being one of the simplest types of forcing , several authors@xcite have studied a one - dimensional system in a box with one or two heated ( stochastic ) walls . of these ,",
    "@xcite study cluster formation , although  @xcite are not strictly one - dimensional .",
    "this article studies a quasielastic one - dimensional system not subject to gravity between two thermalizing walls .",
    "we focus on two control parameters : the total inelasticity parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5  is the number of particles and @xmath6  is the restitution coefficient , and the externally imposed temperature gradient .",
    "the parameter  @xmath7 has been shown to be relevant for the quasielastic system@xcite . by varying these parameters",
    "we determine the region in parameter space where clustering is fully inhibited , obtaining a fluidized state .",
    "we present a singular feature of the distribution function for the clustering regime , and then study how this feature is modified for the fluidized state .    in  @xcite the authors study a one - dimensional system of point - like particles between an elastic and a heated wall .",
    "they emphasize that a cluster inevitably forms away from the heated wall , regardless of how elastic the system is ( as long as it is not perfectly elastic ) .",
    "they also study the same system , but with both walls expelling the particles with a fixed velocity . in this case",
    "they find that the cluster forms away from the walls and roams slowly about the system , with two groups of fast particles connecting the cluster with the `` heated '' walls .    in  @xcite the same system",
    "is studied for different types of boundary conditions at the heated wall .",
    "the stochastic boundary condition studied has the form of a power of the velocity times the `` thermal '' condition ( the one that produces a maxwell - boltzmann distribution in the elastic case ) .",
    "the authors show that when the power that multiplies the thermal condition is positive the test - particle equation ( derived from the boltzmann equation ) has a steady - state solution .",
    "thus the thermal case does not have a steady state and develops a cluster away from the heated wall .",
    "the mechanism for the growth of the cluster is explained and verified numerically .    in  @xcite a similar system",
    "is studied : a long thin pipe of inelastic hard disks with heated walls ( at the same temperature ) at the ends of the pipe and periodic side walls .",
    "the pipe is thin enough for the particle order to be preserved .",
    "the probability distribution for the distance between the central particles is studied .",
    "this distribution gives a markedly denser system near the center than in the elastic case , although the limit to the elastic case is smooth , unlike the strictly one - dimensional case of  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite the same author studies the velocity correlations that this system develops as inelasticity is increased , showing that a consistent description must take these correlations into account .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the one - dimensional system of @xmath5  point - like particles interacting via collisions that conserve momentum but dissipate kinetic energy . to fix notation , the particle velocities after a collision are given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the velocity of particle  @xmath10 before a collision , and @xmath11 , being @xmath6 the restitution coefficient .",
    "for the elastic case ( @xmath12 ) the particles simply exchange velocities . since the particles are point - like , the system is then indistinguishable from a system in which the particles do not interact .",
    "this one - dimensional system is interesting because dissipation is the first order correction to a free gas . besides",
    ", results for the one - dimensional system have been found to have unexpected relevance for higher - dimensional problems .",
    "for example , in two - dimensions the particles involved in inelastic collapse lie roughly on a line@xcite . also , the dissipation - induced temperature gradients calculated in  @xcite for the one - dimensional case inspired the authors to look for dissipation - induced rayleigh - bnard - like convection for a two - dimensional system without an externally imposed temperature gradient@xcite .    for a system with one thermal wall and open on the other side , under the influence of gravity",
    ", the quasielastic system may be kept fluidized@xcite : any cluster that starts to form is forced against the thermal wall , where it evaporates . in  @xcite the test - particle equation@xcite  which is the 1d boltzmann equation where the limit @xmath13 is taken , but keeping @xmath7 fixed  is successfully applied , with close matching of theory and simulations even at the level of the distribution function .",

    "we define the parameter @xmath22 to quantify how far from the symmetrical case is the system . under the same conditions ,",
    "an elastic system has a perfectly bimodal velocity distribution with global homogeneous temperature equal to @xmath23 . for the sake of comparison ,",
    "we simulate systems with @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 represents a symmetrical setting , while @xmath26 represents an infinitely strong temperature gradient .",
    "as in  @xcite , for @xmath25 a cluster unavoidably forms away from the thermal walls . after forming",
    ", the cluster performs an apparently random walk about the center , growing in size ( and therefore mass ) while the rest of the system grows more rarefied . with the decrease in density of the surrounding gas and the increased inertia of the cluster , an eventual collision with one of the walls",
    "is to be expected .",
    "when this happens part of the cluster evaporates , and what is left of it is expelled from the wall ( see fig .  [",
    "fg : cluster_t0t0_qn001_n1000 ] ) , thus restarting the growth process .",
    "thus not only is the system highly clumped , but also in a non - steady state . nevertheless , the gas that is far from the random - walk zone has a well - defined time average for the distribution function , as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fg : t0t0_distrib_pared_qn001 ] .",
    "a noteworthy feature of this distribution is that it exhibits apparently singular behavior for slow velocities .",
    "setting @xmath27 the symmetry of the system is broken .",
    "for @xmath28 the cluster performs a slightly asymmetric random walk , spending more time near the colder wall , and therefore colliding more often with it .",
    "thus the cluster can not grow as much as it did in the symmetric case before colliding with a wall . by increasing @xmath3",
    "the cluster - wall collision frequency grows , even obtaining short `` windows '' in which the cluster completely evaporates . by further increasing  @xmath3 these windows",
    "grow larger until a point is reached where no cluster forms . in this fashion a totally fluidized state",
    "is achieved , which may be tractable with the dissipative boltzmann equation .",
    "however , the distribution function obtained from the molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations exhibits a peculiar non - gaussian feature for slow velocities .",
    "this feature is a smoothed version of the apparent singularity of the symmetric case . to discern whether this feature is due to correlations or",
    "is present before they settle in , we compared newtonian molecular dynamics results with those obtained through direct - simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) , which neglects correlations .",
    "the results agree very well , except when the system approaches the clustering regime .",
    "we simulate the system through event - driven molecular dynamics@xcite and through direct - simulation monte carlo@xcite .",
    "the direct - simulation monte carlo procedures use the null - collision technique@xcite where , overestimating the collision frequency ( using the maximum relative velocity within a cell ) , the number of collisions to be _ attempted _ is calculated through a poisson process . in the next step the collisions are attempted , choosing at random two particles within the cell , and making them collide with a probability proportional to their relative velocity .",
    "most of the molecular dynamics and dsmc simulations were done with @xmath29 particles .    in the md simulations we detect clusters using a geometric criterion : we consider chains of particles that are nearer than a critical distance ( in our case  @xmath30 and  @xmath31 , to be certain that the conclusions are independent of the choice ) .",
    "the system length is one , and with a thousand particles the mean distance between neighbors for a homogeneous system is  @xmath32 .",
    "thus we detect particles that are uncommonly near by three orders of magnitude .",
    "we discard chains of length three or less , since they may be random encounters . measuring the _ total _ length of the cluster we have found that on average it is of the order of  @xmath31 ; thus the choice of @xmath31 as link - link distance is much larger than the true distance between them",

    "when the cluster reaches a wall , part of it evaporates , and the growth process begins anew .    as is usual for the quasielastic case , we relabel the particles when they collide .",
    "this enables us to visualize this system as a group of barely interacting particles passing through each other .",
    "the picture for cluster evolution , as explained before , is the following : the cluster grows because the slowest particles , due to the asymmetry of the distribution function , drift towards the cluster@xcite . as it grows , the density of the gas surrounding it decreases , with the consequent saturation in growth .",
    "thus we have a `` brownian particle '' of increasing mass moving in an increasingly rarefied medium .",
    "this `` particle '' will be increasingly less affected by the surrounding medium , until it can no longer be kept away from the walls .",
    "the cluster moves several orders of magnitude slower than the thermal speed ( three orders of magnitude in fig .",

    "the front liners strike the wall and are expelled by it much faster than the other cluster members .",
    "these particles pass through the cluster , transferring momentum to it , as described in  @xcite .",
    "thus these fast particles push the cluster away from the wall , where it can absorb particles again .",
    "the fast particles , however , no longer belong to the cluster .",
    "since the slowest particles in the gas are the ones that will be absorbed by the cluster@xcite , it is the number of slow particles in the gas that will determine the cluster s growth rate . after the cluster strikes a wall",
    ", the expelled particles will be fast particles , and they will not contribute to the growth of the cluster during the time it takes for the gas to cool down again : the only particles available for absorption are the ones that were available before the cluster - wall collision . this explains why the cluster keeps growing at approximately the same rate it did before the collision . after the gas has cooled down , the growth rate returns to its normal value .",
    "this is the end of the plateau seen in fig .",
    "[ fg : cluster_t0t0_qn001_n1000 ] after each cluster - wall collision .    to quantify the evaporation process we proceed as in  @xcite : as soon as the first particle belonging to the cluster reaches a wall , it is expelled with a speed much higher than the cluster velocity ; thus we may consider the ideal situation of a cluster of @xmath37 particles at rest being stricken by a fast particle with velocity  @xmath38 ( in this case @xmath39 ) . after colliding with the first particle in the cluster ,",
    "the new fast particle s speed will be @xmath40 .",
    "thus , after traversing the cluster , the fast particle s velocity will be @xmath41 . since momentum is conserved in collisions , the center of mass of the cluster will have acquired a speed of @xmath42 considering the case @xmath43 with fixed  @xmath7 , as in  @xcite , we may simplify this expression to @xmath44 by further considering the case @xmath45 we get @xmath46 . in this limit ,",
    "if the cluster reaches the wall with velocity  @xmath47 and is expelled from it with velocity @xmath48 , the number @xmath49 of particles evaporated will satisfy @xmath50 .",

    "therefore , any attempt at solving the boltzmann equation through moment methods must consider this feature in the initial _ ansatz _ , as is done for the problem of an infinitely strong shock wave in  @xcite and  @xcite . in fact , a solution for this problem was attempted using the four moment method of  @xcite . as mentioned in  @xcite",
    ", the fourth balance equation could not be freely chosen when the boundary conditions were symmetric : some choices gave undefined results . as is natural , by not including the non - gaussian feature in the _ ansatz _ for this calculation we obtained absurd results , such as higher temperature in the middle of the system than near the walls .",
    "we compared molecular dynamics with direct - simulation monte carlo .",
    "agreement between these two methods shows that the non - gaussian feature of the distribution function may be predicted by the dissipative boltzmann equation . as the system approaches cluster formation ,",
