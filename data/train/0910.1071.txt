    "over the last year , co - doped bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite has emerged as an ideal platform for detailed investigation into the physical properties of iron - based high temperature superconductors .",
    "the advantages of electron - doped ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 are manyfold .",
    "first and foremost , it is relatively straightforward to grow homogeneous single crystals @xcite .",
    "these single crystals allowed us to conduct a systematic nmr @xcite and transport measurements @xcite throughout a broad range of the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "availability of high quality single crystals also led many other researchers to concentrate their efforts on investigating ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "thanks to these concerted efforts , we can compare experimental results obtained by different techniques and build a comprehensive physical picture .",
    "furthermore , the existence of an overdoped non - superconducting metallic regime @xcite allows us to investigate the fate of spin fluctuations when overdoping suppresses superconductivity @xcite .    in this invited paper",
    ", we will provide a perspective on the physical properties of ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 focusing on two key issues .",
    "first , we will extend our earlier transport measurements in ambient and applied pressure @xcite , establish a new complete electronic phase diagram of ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 under pressure of 2.4  gpa up to the overdoped regime , and discuss its implications .",
    "second , we will also deduce the temperature dependence of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations ( afsf ) in optimally doped ba(fe@xmath3co@xmath4)@xmath2as@xmath2 based on a phenomenological two component analysis of our @xmath5as nmr data @xcite , and explain why afsf may be the glue of superconducting cooper pairs .",
    "in fig.1 , we reproduce the electronic phase diagram of ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 in ambient pressure @xmath6 reported first by ning et al .",
    "@xcite with newer data points for the overdoped region @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "a striking aspect of the phase diagram is that the superconducting dome is adjacent to an underdoped region with magnetically ordered ground states .",
    "analogous proximity between superconducting and magnetic phases has been encountered in many unconventional superconductors in the past , including the high @xmath8 cuprates .",
    "co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 in ambient pressure ( open symbols ) and 2.4  gpa ( filled symbols ) . , width=264 ]    also shown in fig.1 are the magnetic phase transition temperature @xmath9 and the superconducting @xmath8 under 2.4  gpa of hydrostatic pressure , as determined by resistivity measurements .",
    "we refer readers to ref .",
    "@xcite for the details of experimental procedures .",
    "we note that this is the first report on the effects of pressure on @xmath8 in the overdoped region of ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "application of 2.4  gpa pushes the sdw phase boundary toward smaller @xmath10 , and extends the superconducting dome .",
    "one can certainly argue that this is evidence for competition between superconductivity and magnetism .",
    "however , such a viewpoint may be too simplistic , because suppression of the sdw ordered regime is accompanied by the creation of a new paramagnetic regime with enhanced paramagnetic spin fluctuations ; the latter may cause the expansion of the superconducting dome to smaller values of @xmath10 .    in passing ,",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath8 _ increases _ by @xmath11  k under pressure for both @xmath12 ( @xmath13  k in @xmath6 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath15  k in @xmath6 ) .",
    "although the pressure coefficient is only modest in the overdoped regime ( e.g. @xmath16  k / gpa for @xmath12 ) , @xmath17 is always _ positive _ in the entire phase diagram .",
    "our finding is in contrast with the case of hole - doped k@xmath1sr@xmath0fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , where @xmath17 changes its sign from positive to negative in the overdoped regime @xcite .",
    "the results for k@xmath1sr@xmath0fe@xmath2as@xmath2 were interpreted in the context of transfer of holes from k@xmath1sr@xmath0 charge reservoir layers to feas layers under pressure . in the present case",
    ", we are doping electrons directly into feas layers by substituting fe with co.",
    "the exact nature of the magnetically ordered ground state under the presence of co is still somewhat controversial , but there is a consensus that the magnetic phase transition is second order in ba(fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 for @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , we observe a divergent signature toward @xmath9 in the temperature dependence of @xmath19 , i.e. the nmr spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath20 divided by @xmath21 @xcite . @xmath19 probes the weighted * q*-integral in the brillouin zone ( b.z . ) of low frequency spin fluctuations at the nmr frequency @xmath22  mhz ,    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the hyperfine form factor , and @xmath25 is the imaginary part of the dynamical electron spin susceptibility .",
    "the divergent behavior of @xmath19 towards a magnetic phase transition signals the critical slowing down of spin fluctuations expected for second order magnetic phase transitions . in other words , near the sdw phase boundary , low frequency spin fluctuations are highly enhanced .    in view of the proximity between the sdw and superconducting phases in fig.1 ,",
    "a natural question is if spin fluctuations are enhanced even in the normal metallic state above @xmath26  k of the optimally doped ba(fe@xmath3co@xmath4)@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "our earlier nmr measurements answered this question @xcite .",
    "fig.2 summarizes the key physical properties of ba(fe@xmath3co@xmath4)@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "our @xmath5as nmr data in fig.2c indeed captured a clear signature of enhancement of @xmath19 from @xmath27  k to @xmath8 .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath19 toward @xmath8 is stronger when we apply the external magnetic field @xmath28 along the ab - plane rather than the c - axis .",
    "this is because the ab - plane components of the hyperfine magnetic fields transferred from fe layers accidentally cancel out at @xmath5as sites for commensurate antiferromagnetic wave vectors .",
    "@xmath19 probes spin fluctuations orthogonal to the quantization axis of nuclear spins , and the latter is along the direction of @xmath28 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath19 with @xmath29 is less efficient in capturing afsf .",
    "since the divergent behavior of @xmath19 at @xmath9 for @xmath30 arises from slowing of afsf for the wave vector modes @xmath31  ( @xmath32,0 ) and ( 0,@xmath32 ) , we can infer that the same ( or similar ) modes of afsf near @xmath33 are enhanced in the optimal superconducting composition toward @xmath8 .",
    "co@xmath4)@xmath2as@xmath2 single crystal ( @xmath34  k ) : ( a ) in - plane resistivity with a t - linear fit @xcite .",
    "( b ) spin susceptibility deduced from the nmr knight shift @xcite . ( c ) temperature dependence of low frequency spin fluctuations integrated over the entire b.z . , as measured by @xmath5as nmr @xmath19 @xcite . ( d ) deconvolution of the results in ( c ) into the contribution from the antiferromagnetic @xmath35 mode of spin fluctuations @xmath36 and the background contribution @xmath37 ( see main text ) . ,",
    "width=415 ]    another interesting point in fig.2c is that the temperature dependence of @xmath19 is not monotonic ; the overall spin fluctuations integrated over the entire first b.z .",
    "_ decrease _ with temperature from 290  k down to about 100  k. furthermore , the temperature dependence of static uniform ( @xmath38 ) spin susceptibility deduced from the spin contribution to the nmr knight shift @xmath39 decreases with temperature , as shown in fig.2b .",
    "comparison of fig.2b and fig.2c suggests that spin excitations are _ suppressed _ with decreasing temperature for a broad range of wave vector modes , including a region near the b.z .",
    "center @xmath40 .",
    "we recall that an analogous suppression of overall spin excitations was first observed in lafeaso@xmath41f@xmath42 ( @xmath43  k ) @xcite , and more recently in stoichiometric fese ( @xmath44  k ) @xcite , and hence this is probably a generic feature shared by iron - based superconductors .",
    "simultaneous suppression of both nmr knight shift and @xmath19 is generally called _ spin gap _ or _",
    "pseudo gap _ behavior .",
    "recently , inelastic neutron scattering measurements on ba(fe@xmath45co@xmath46)@xmath2as@xmath2 also confirmed the enhancement of afsf toward @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however , neutron data showed monotonous _",
    "increase _ of afsf all the way from 280  k down to @xmath8 , without the initial decrease observed in fig.2c from 290  k to 100  k. the key to understanding the reason behind the apparent contradiction between nmr and neutron data above 100  k is that @xmath19 reflects the integral of spin fluctuations over the entire b.z . , while the neutron data in ref .",
    "@xcite integrates only a peak located at @xmath33 .",
    "we emphasize that nmr is very good at detecting small @xmath25 even if there are no pronounced peaks in the * q * and/or @xmath47 space .",
    "combined with the neutron data , our results in fig.2c suggest that low energy spin excitations in a broad range of the wave vector space far from @xmath33 are suppressed with decreasing temperature from 290  k down to 100  k.    to illustrate our point more clearly , we employ a phenomenological two component picture and assume that @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath36 arises from afsf with @xmath49 , and we further assume ( for simplicity ) that it obeys a curie - weiss law , @xmath50 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath37 represents the contributions by the background of the dynamical susceptibility far from @xmath33 , which may have only mild @xmath51 dependence and would be very difficult to observe using neutron scattering . in view of the similarity of the temperature dependence between the overall @xmath52 and @xmath39 between 290  k and 100  k",
    ", it is reasonable to make a working ansatz , @xmath53 .",
    "we showed earlier @xcite that @xmath54 with a pseudo gap @xmath55  k , as shown by a solid curve in fig.2b .",
    "the solid curves in fig.2c represent the best fit of the data with the phenomenological two - component model , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are the free parameters .",
    "we deduced the temperature dependence of @xmath36 as @xmath60 from the fit in fig.2c , and the results are presented in fig.2d .",
    "we found @xmath61  k for @xmath62 .",
    "very small @xmath59 is consistent with a viewpoint that the optimally doped ba(fe@xmath3co@xmath4)@xmath2as@xmath2 is in the vicinity of a quantum critical point @xcite .",
    "also notice that our results of @xmath63 deduced as @xmath36 in fig.2d show almost identical behavior to the neutron scattering data integrated near @xmath49 for energy transfer @xmath64  mev@xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that the optimal high @xmath8 superconducting phase ba(fe@xmath3co@xmath4)@xmath2as@xmath2 exists in close proximity with magnetically ordered ground state , and that low frequency antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations are still enhanced near @xmath34  k. based on a phenomenological two - component model analysis , we also explained that the pseudogap like behavior above @xmath27  k arises from the suppression with temperature of a background spin susceptibility spread over a broad range of * q * values away from @xmath33 .",
    "the nmr results for the optimal superconducting phase alone do not necessarily prove that spin fluctuations are the _ cause _ of superconductivity . one can , in principle , argue that @xmath8 is as _ low _ as 22  k in ba(fe@xmath3co@xmath4)@xmath2as@xmath2 because the residual antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations are disrupting the formation of cooper pairs . however , there are two pieces of strong evidence which support the idea that afsf help the formation of cooper pairs . first , the suppression of superconductivity in the overdoped region above @xmath65 is accompanied by that of afsf @xcite .",
    "if afsf tend to suppress @xmath8 for @xmath66 , the suppression of afsf would have to enhance @xmath8 for @xmath67 instead .",
    "second , we also found in the related compound fese that the application of pressure enhances @xmath8 and afsf simultaneously @xcite .    12 a.  s. sefat et al .",
