    "although the chemistry of the positron in crystalline solids and soft - condensed matter has an intrinsic interest by itself , it is mainly studied in connection of probing the electron chemistry and the open volume of materials by positrons . thermalized positrons become localized inside open volume defects such as vacancies and voids where the repulsion by the nucleus is minimum .",
    "when probing soft matter , the positron chemistry has to be taken into account because a positron can bind an electron and form a positronium ( ps ) atom before getting trapped into open volume pockets  @xcite .",
    "the annihilation properties of the positron are determined by the local electronic structures and the distribution of the open volume .",
    "positron annihilation spectroscopy ( pas ) exploits this property to measure the type and concentration of vacancies in metals and semiconductors  @xcite . by measuring the lifetime of ps",
    ", the distribution of open volume has been studied in porous sio@xmath0  @xcite , polymers  @xcite and biostructures  @xcite .    the interpretation of pas experiments benefits from the comparison to computational predictions .",
    "however , the description of an electron - positron system embedded in a host material requires addressing the correlations of light particles beyond the adiabatic approximation , the quantum - mechanical delocalization and the zero - point energy . regrettably , using many - body techniques for a full quantum - mechanical treatment of the problem is clearly beyond the present - day computational capacity . instead",
    ", in metals and semiconductors the distributions and the annihilation properties of positrons can be calculated from first principles to a good accuracy within the two - component density functional theory ( 2c - dft ) and the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange and correlation functionals  @xcite . for a delocalized positron in a perfect lattice",
    "the scheme works particularly well because the electron - positron correlation energy functional is known very accurately within the lda in this limit .",
    "moreover , the same method can be applied also for positrons trapped at vacancies .",
    "the calculated positron annihilation parameters can then be used for a quantitative analysis of the experimental results for metals and semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "however , the 2c - dft scheme is considered to be unable to describe ps and instead semiempirical methods have been employed to describe the matter - ps interaction  @xcite .",
    "the many - body wavefunctions of small positronic systems composed by a positron interacting with a light atom or a small molecule can be calculated to a good accuracy using the quantum monte - carlo ( qmc )  @xcite and configuration interaction ( ci )  @xcite methods . in this work ,",
    "we have obtained accurate positron energies and densities for positronic atoms including a positron ( e@xmath1h , e@xmath1he , @xmath1 and @xmath1 ) and ps ( hps and lips ) by an exact diagonalization stochastic variational method ( svm ) using an explicitly correlated gaussian ( ecg ) function basis set .    in @xmath1",
    "an electron from li forms a ps atom with the positron and becomes bound to the li@xmath1 ion . in @xmath1 the polarized electron cloud binds the positron . in hps and lips the unpaired atom electrons form a chemical bond that binds the ps strongly to the atom . on the other hand , the positron is not bound to the atom in the e@xmath1h and e@xmath1he systems .",
    "ecg - svm accounts for more correlation energy for the bound states  @xcite and the resulting binding energies are larger than for qmc and ci .    on the basis of our many - body results",
    "we propose a single - particle potential for the positron and we derive it for all the positronic systems by inverting a single - particle schrdinger equation .",
    "we check the accuracy by comparing the ensuing scattering lengths and the s - wave phase shifts to the corresponding many - body values .",
    "we also compare the many - body densities and the introduced single - particle potentials to the corresponding results of 2c - dft within lda for bound @xmath1 , @xmath1 , hps and lips .",
    "the agreement seen predicts that 2c - dft and lda can be the starting point to describe positron bound states including systems in which ps is formed .",
    "finally , we discuss the utility of the single - particle effective potentials to approach a practical and predictive description of positron and ps states in condensed matter .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows .",
    "the many - body ecg - svm as well as the 2c - dft schemes are shortly described in chapter  [ sec_computational ] .",
    "chapter  [ sec_results ] presents and discusses the effective single - particle potentials , the elastic scattering parameters and the self - consistent 2c - dft - lda results .",

    ", the potentials have a long - range attractive tails which make the positron densities too delocalized .",
    "many - body calculations at the low - density range of the electron - positron plasma would be required to obtain an electron - positron correlation potential which is accurate beyond the metallic density regime .",
    "the asymmetric behavior of the lda electron and positron densities with respect to the many - body calculations reflects the means of dft to describe correlations in the interacting many - body system  @xcite .",

    "the positron binding energies of all the studied systems are only qualitative , reflecting the general inadequacy of lda to accurately describe binding between atoms . moreover ,",
    "it is a well known problem that dft within lda is not able to describe dispersion interactions  @xcite .",
    "[ sec_discussion ] it is well established that the lda 2c - dft yields reliable densities for positrons trapped at vacancies inside metals and semiconductors  @xcite . to simplify the calculations or to compare different approaches , it would be desirable to calculate the positron potentials also as superpositions of atomic or molecular @xmath31 in condensed matter . however , the transferability of @xmath31 deduced from single positronic atoms or molecules is of concern .",
    "the trapping of positrons in vacancies inside metals and semiconductors occurs partly because the valence electrons relax into the vacancy as attracted by the positron increasing the binding energy and the degree of localization of the positron . in the 2c - dft",
    "this is taken into account through the electron - positron correlation functional which lowers the energy of the positron inside the vacancy .",
    "however , in @xmath31 obtained from an atom - positron system the valence electrons remain bound to the atom and its atomic superposition can not predict the positron trapping inside vacancies of crystalline solids .",
    "the utility of @xmath31 will not be limited by this problem in condensed matter systems where the electronic structures of the constituent atoms or molecules remain nearly undisturbed like in molecular soft condensed matter and liquids where inter - molecular interactions are weak .",
    "the superposition of molecular @xmath31 potentials is particularly interesting from the point of view of studying ps embedded in molecular materials like polymers , liquids or biostructures .",
    "typically , the exchange repulsion between the ps and the homo - lumo gap ( @xmath340.5  a.u . ) of closed shell molecules prevents the formation of a ps bound state .",
    "instead ps is localized in open volume pockets at the potential wells induced by the surrounding molecules .",

    "he does not bind ps due to its closed shell structure and its low polarizability .",
    "it possesses a homo - lumo gap in a spin - compensated electron structure similarly to molecular matter and thus it provides a good model system to study the interaction of ps .",
    "the knowledge gained studying model systems would allow building @xmath31 when ab - initio methods can not be used .",
    "moreover , our notion that the computationally efficient 2c - dft within lda reproduces accurately the many - body single - particles potentials for systems with ps , raises the expectation that it could be used to construct ps @xmath31 .",

    "the scattering lengths are consistent with the many - body values in the literature and the s - wave phase shifts show also good agreement for moments @xmath36  a.u.@xmath37 .",
    "the low - energy correlations are well described by @xmath31 up to energies larger than that of quasi - thermalized positrons and ps at room temperature .",

    "the superposition of atomic or molecular @xmath31 to calculate the positron potentials and the ensuing positron distributions in molecular condensed matter can be a valid description of the positron in ps when the inter - molecular interactions are weak and the transferability is not of concern .",
