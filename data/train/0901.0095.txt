    "a number of different spectroscopic techniques can be applied to eis observations . for a review on different spectroscopic techniques",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the intensity of an optically thin emission line can be written as    @xmath8    where a(z ) is the elemental abundance , @xmath9 is the electron temperature , and @xmath10 is the electron density .",
    "g(@xmath9 , @xmath10 ) is the _ contribution function _ which contains all the relevant atomic parameters for each line , in particular the ionization fraction and excitation parameters . in quiet solar conditions",
    "it is usually assumed that ionization equilibrium holds and the g(@xmath9 , @xmath10 ) can be obtained using equilibrium ionization balance calculations .",
    "for this purpose we have used chianti , v5.2 @xcite .",

    "we plot the ratios of observed intensities with the contribution function i@xmath13/(a(z )  g(n@xmath14 ,  t@xmath14 ) ) obtained using ionization balance calculations as a function of temperature .",
    "if the plasma is isothermal along the los then all the curves would cross at a single location indicating a single temperature .",
    "more precisely , this method is useful to find out if the plasma along the los is isothermal or multi - thermal .",
    "the eis wavelength bands were chosen to cover many density diagnostic lines ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "obtaining the filling factor provides an indication of whether the loop structures are composed of multiple strands or not .",
    "measuring the filling factors is very difficult due to the accumulated errors in estimating electron density , total emission measure ( i.e. , ionization equilibrium calculations ) and the column depth . the main uncertainty , however , comes from the estimation of the column depth of the emitting plasma .",
    "one of the main problems when studying the plasma parameters in coronal loops is to identify a loop which does not show substantial changes during the observing period .",
    "investigating the observation sequence taken by the trace , we find that the well defined loop structures seen after the first hinode eclipse do not change significantly , at least within the time period when the eis was rastering over them . although there was a filament eruption at around 12:56  ut , one of the legs of which was rooted just west of the active region loops , the loops studied in this paper do not show any significant variations which could affect our study of the physical parameters . to be absolutely sure of this ,",
    "we have also studied a raster by the eis taken before the eruption ( start : 09:42:12 , end : 10:31:24  ut ) .",
    "we find that the loop structure has not changed from that raster to the one for which we have derived the physical parameters .",
    "we did not use the earlier raster to derive the physical parameters because the exposure time was short and therefore , we did not have enough counts for a good diagnostic study .    since this study provides measurements of the physical parameters along a _ quiescent coronal loop _",
    ", the results obtained can be reliably used as a benchmark against theoretical models of active region loops .",
    "one of the most important features of the eis is to provide simultaneous observations at many different temperatures with an excellent spectral resolution ( @xmath0  3  km  s@xmath1 ) .",

    "the core of the active region is seen in high temperature lines .",
    "the active region shape become more compact and bright at temperatures such as log  t[k]=6.3 ( ) and log  t[k]=6.4 ( ) .",

[ int_vel ] ) , instrumental effects such as the eis _ slit - tilt _ and spacecraft _",
    "orbital variation _ have to be compensated for .",
    "it is known that the eis slits are not vertical on the detectors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the 1slit has a tilt of about 1.2@xmath1710@xmath18   / pixel .",
    "therefore , while deriving velocities , it is essential to compensate for this effect .",
    "this is done using the idl routine _ eis_slit_tilt.pro _ provided in the ssw tree . after compensating for the slit - tilt",

    "eis_orbit_spline.pro _ also provided in _",
    "ssw_. exploring a large number of datasets it has been concluded that the spacecraft orbital variation changes from one eis study to another . therefore , there is no automatic way to compensate for this effect and it has to be estimated for each and every study separately . to estimate the orbital variation ,",
    "it is necessary to select a quiet region in the raster . by doing so ,",
    "we ensure that we do not remove ( add ) any original ( artifact ) values from ( to ) the data . for this purpose , we selected the bottom 50 pixels in the quiet - sun region in this raster . by studying the average variations of the line centroids , we could determine the effects of orbital variation . applying the above mentioned corrections",
    ", we obtained a corrected set of data , to enable us to estimate the doppler shift in the coronal structures .",
    "to summarize , the at rest reference wavelength has been obtained by considering the bottom 50 pixels .    based on sumer measurements",
    ", @xcite and @xcite found that the spectral lines show non - zero line shifts in quiet - sun observations .",
    "the cooler temperature lines ( t  @xmath19  0.5  mk ) showed red shifted emission while the hotter lines ( t  @xmath20  0.5  mk ) were blue shifted .",
    "ideally , while investigating the doppler shift measurements this effect should be considered .",
    "however , we note that sumer does not observe spectral lines forming at temperature higher than log t[mk ] = 6.1 i.e. temperature corresponding to line . therefore , this effect can only be taken in account for the line such as , and in our analysis and not for high temperature lines studied in this paper such as , and .",
    "since we are interested in comparing the flows observed in these lines with respect to each other , it is not worthwhile taking such effects into account for some lines but not for higher temperature lines .    the bottom row images in fig .",
    "[ int_vel ] show the derived doppler velocity maps for different lines .",
    "the velocities maps are plotted in the range of @xmath21  30  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the velocity maps show redshifts and blueshifts all over the active region .",
    "the redshifts ( downflows ) are more prominent in the core region of the active region and blue shifts ( up flows ) are more prominent at the boundary of the active region similar to the observations made by e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the plasma flow structures in high lying loops are better defined at lower temperatures in a similar way to structures seen in the intensity maps . to compare the flow structure in a spatially resolved coronal loop , we have marked a chosen loop with an arrow in the velocity maps in top panel of fig .",
    "[ int_vel ] .",
    "plasma downflow is seen at all temperature along the loop .",
    "however , downflows are localized towards the foot point regions in cooler lines such as and ( not shown in figure ) and was as high as ( @xmath0  60  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "downflows are seen all along the loop in and lines being stronger towards the foot point region . at high temperatures such as log  t[k]=6.3 ( ) and log  t[k]=6.4 ( )",
    "the downflows are stronger toward the loop top regions with almost no downflow signature at foot points .",
    "we note that these velocities are along the los",
    ". therefore the actual velocities would be much higher than these values .    from the intensity and velocity maps",
    ", it appears that the region showing red - shift in cooler spectral lines shows blue - shift in high temperature lines . to show this quantitatively",
    "we have selected two regions labelled region 1 and region 2 ( see top panel of fig .",
    "[ vel_plot ] ) and plotted the average velocities obtained at different lines ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ vel_plot ] ) .",
    "these two regions are located at the foot points of the high lying coronal structures .",
    "as it is evident from the plot , in line both the regions show redshifted emission ( downflows ) turning to blueshifted emission ( upflows ) with increasing temperatures .",
    "we note that both the selected regions correspond to footpoint regions of coronal loop .",
    "observation of blueshifted emission in high temperature lines at the base of coronal loops provides evidence of upflows in loops .",
    "it is worth pointing out that if we take into account the results obtained from sumer measurements @xcite , the average downflows in would be weaker by about @xmath0  3  km  s@xmath1 and average upflows seen in and would be stronger by about @xmath0  4 and @xmath0  9  km  s@xmath1 respectively .",
    "however , we do not have measurements for other higher temperature lines from sumer to make such a comparison .",
    "after the first hinode eclipse , the eis recorded a few very well defined vertical loop structures ( see fig .",
    "[ context ] right panel x=[0:50 ] arcsec ) before going into another eclipse .",
    "the orientations of these loops ( almost north - south ) are such that rastering across the loops does not take a long time ( less than  20  mins ) .",
    "therefore , this loop system offers us an excellent opportunity to study the physical plasma parameters along active region loops at a given time . from now on we will only focus on the region @xmath0",
    "x=[-10:65 ] arcsec and @xmath0  y=[70:220 ] .",

    "[ loop_difftemp ] ( top panel ) shows monochromatic images of the sub - region from the eis raster .",

    "structures in are the sharpest and are fuzziest in .",
    "the structures seen in are similar to those seen in the trace 171   image ( see fig .",
    "[ context ] left panel ) .",
    "however the small difference is due to somewhat better spatial resolution of trace ( 1 ) than that of eis ( 3 - 4 ) .",
    "the active region loop structures are clearly discernible in the line .",
    "the images obtained in the and lines lack clarity while noting that the loops seen in line may have partial overlap with line . based on these observations it is plausible to conclude that the coronal structures are fuzzy at higher temperatures .",
    "this in itself has been a matter of debate amongst the solar physics community for many years ( since skylab days ) .",
    "the question concerns whether the solar corona really is fuzzy at high temperatures or simply appears to be fuzzy because the instrumental spatial resolution and line intensities are insufficient at higher temperatures .",
    "the high temperature corona was observed with the soft x - ray telescope ( sxt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) aboard yohkoh , however cooler temperature emission could not be observed with yohkoh .",
    "the soho / cds instrument could observe the corona simultaneously at low temperature ( @xmath0log  t[k ]  =  5.0  mk ) as well as high temperatures @xmath0  log  t[k ]  =  6.4  mk .",
    "however , the cds spatial resolution ( @xmath0  5 - 6  ) was not enough to unambiguously resolve this issue . similarly with soho / eit which could observe the sun at low temperature using its channel and at high temperature using the channel but did nt have sufficiently good spatial resolution .    to clarify this point , we chose a region ( marked between the two horizontal white lines in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ loop_difftemp ] ) and plotted the corresponding intensity profile ( summed in the y - direction ) in bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ loop_difftemp ] .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the intensity fluctuations due to the presence of spatially resolved coronal features are highly pronounced in low temperature emission , but much less obvious at higher temperatures .",
    "the intensity images in and lines , shows a spike at location x=40 which is basically due to a spatially resolved loop , marked by an arrow as loop b. another active region loop a is also marked by arrows in the image .",
    "for both these loops we can identify enhancements in the intensity profiles for lines such as , and .",
    "however in the image , the intensity corresponding to loop b has almost disappeared in the fuzzy background , but the intensity enhancement corresponding to loop a is still clearly discernible . the intensity fluctuation corresponding to the loop a is still just about discernible in and .",
    "however shows a sharp decrease in intensity corresponding to the position of loop a. it is interesting to note that the intensity profile corresponding to the line shows a dip for both the coronal loops marked a and b. however , it also shows a sharp enhancement ( barely identifiable in lower panel plots ) between these two dips where the intensity profiles corresponding to cooler lines show a dip .",
    "the plot also demonstrate the possible partial overlaps between the loop structures seen in line and those seen in line .",
    "this basically implies that active regions are comprised of coronal loops seen at different temperatures and intermingled with each other ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "one of the most important issues when studying the problem of active region heating and the coronal heating in general is whether the coronal loops are isothermal or multi - thermal along the los .",

    "* ) showed that the loops were isothermal along the los and the proper treatment of the diffuse background is important .",
    "given the excellent spatial resolution of eis and the broad temperature coverage , we have estimated temperature along the los at many given points along the loop length .",

    "the downflows are localized towards the loop top ( see fig .  [ int_vel ] ) .",
    "we note that the velocities measured at quiet sun vary with temperature @xcite . taking account of this variation would not substantially affect our results . *",
    "the active region structures are more clearly defined in lower temperature lines and appear fuzzy at higher temperature .",
    "this is consistent with indications from previous solar observations .",
    "however , confirmation of this required spectroscopic observations with the same instrument over a range of temperatures , with good spatial resolution , as provided by the eis ( see fig .  [ loop_difftemp ] ) . * using the em - loci method we find that that both loops studied here are almost isothermal along the los . the temperature at the footpoint is about 0.80  mk and increases to about 1.5  mk at a projected height of about 75  mm ( see fig .  [ temperature ] ) .",
    "* the derived electron densities decrease with loop altitude . towards the footpoint ,",
    "the electron density estimated using ratios is log  n@xmath24=9.8  @xmath3 which decreases to log  n@xmath24=8.5  @xmath3 at an altitude of about 75  mm . the densities obtained using were similar to densities .",
    "however , the estimated densities using line ratios were smaller than those obtained using towards the footpoint locations and reached a value similar to that of at a projected height of about 25  mm ( see fig .  [ dens_plot ] ) . * using the densities obtained by , and line ratios and the loop s diameter as the thickness along the los , we find that the filling factor increases with projected height .",
    "the filling factor obtained using densities is about 0.02 at the footpoint and about 0.8 at a projected height of 40  mm . for lines ,",
    "the filling factors were similar to those of lines but become more than 1 at a projected height of 25  mm .",
    "we find substantially different results for ( see table  1 ) , closer to unity .",
    "an understanding of the problem the coronal heating is a long lasting one and it is now widely believed that studying the physics of all kinds of loops holds the key .",
    "there have been many recent theoretical developments to explain the heating in coronal loops and in active regions .",
    "however , the observational confirmations of these theories have not been possible unambiguously for various reasons . for example the nanoflare model originally proposed by @xcite and latter on globally modelled by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that the coronal loops are comprised of many sub - resolution strands and they are all being heating separately .",
    "this predicts that the loops are multi - thermal along the los .",
    "in addition , this model also predicts high velocity evaporative upflows at high temperatures .",
    "using the idea of multi - stranded coronal loops in a 1d hydrodynamic simulation , @xcite suggested that these high velocity upflows can been seen as non - thermal broadening with a particular enhancement in blue wing in high - temperature spectral lines .",
    "observational confirmation of these predictions can only be unambiguously performed using spectroscopic observations with high spectral and spatial resolution with a broad temperature coverage .",
    "thanks to the excellent simultaneous spectral and spatial resolution of eis , we are now able to study flows and other physical parameters in an active region and also in spatially resolved coronal structures in detail .",
    "observations of strong downflows at the foot point in cooler transition region temperatures are similar to previous observations using sumer measurements ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to that we also observed downflows only towards the loop top in higher temperature lines such that and .",
    "the observation of downflows at all temperatures raises the question concerning the origin of the plasma in the loop and suggests that there must be some sort of upflow of plasma filling up the loops .",
    "@xcite performed a forward modelling of emission line for eis using data from a one dimensional hydrodynamic simulations and suggested that the signatures of high speed upflows can be seen as non - thermal broadening and blue - wing enhancement in the line observed by the eis .",
    "unfortunately , the study sequence used in the present analysis did not contain that line with sufficient counts preventing us to perform a direct comparison .",
    "recently @xcite studied line profiles for at foot point of coronal loops .",
    "they observed a slight enhancement in the blue wing suggesting that this could be associated with high velocity upflows at higher temperature as suggested by @xcite .",
    "similar to our observations , @xcite also did not observe any signature of downflows towards the foot point of the loops in high temperature lines and suggested that the absence of downflows towards the footpoint could be attributed to the presence of high velocity upflows .",
    "moreover , in the present study the observations of average flow structures turning from downflows to upflows in regions located at the foot points of the coronal loops provides another argument in favor of upflows in coronal loops at higher temperatures . in a recent study using the idea of nano - flare foot - point heating ,",
    "@xcite predict upflows of plasma in line which seem to match with our observations .",
    "the idea of multi - stranded impulsively heated coronal loop suggests that the filling factor values should be less than unity .",
    "this is precisely what our measurements show . in our measurements",
    "we find that the filling factors are much less than unity at log t[mk ] = 6.1 and is closer to unity at transition region temperature ( log t[mk ] = 5.8 ) towards the foot point . however , with increasing projected height , the filling factors at log t[mk ] = 6.1 increases while that for log t[mk]=5.8 decreases .",
    "this means that towards the foot points of the loop most of the plasma is at transition region temperature .",
    "however , with increasing projected height , the amount of plasma at log t[mk ] = 6.1 increases .",
    "this suggests an increasing temperature with projected height of the loop .",
    "this is exactly what we obtained using the em - loci analysis .",
    "the em - loci analysis ( see fig .  [ temperature ] ) shows that the temperature along the loop increases with the projected height of the loop being @xmath00.8  mk at the foot point and @xmath01.5  mk at a projected height of about 75  mm .",
    "the em - loci analysis also shows that the plasma along the los is close to isothermal .",
    "however , the different flow structures and densities obtained using different spectral lines and filling factors values less than unity emphasize the multi - thermality of the plasma along the los .",
    "it is not trivial to reconcile these two results together .",
    "we note that the multi - thermality of plasma along the los is one of the most important ingredient in the model of multi - stranded impulsively heated coronal loop .",
    "however , so far we do not know how multi - thermal or how isothermal the plasma is observationally and also theoretically . in this analysis ,",
    "e.g. , at least for the first few point from the foot point of the loop , the loops does not appear to be exactly isothermal .",
    "there appears a narrow distribution of temperatures .",
    "based on observations of a number of loops using eis data , @xcite showed that the coronal loops which are bright at have a narrow distribution of temperature but they are not isothermal .",
    "the observations of high speed downflows and concurrent upflows in coronal loops in addition to very low values of filling factors and their nearly - isothermal structure along the los provide very important constraints in the modelling of coronal loops .",
    "given the capabilities of eis , more measurements should be performed for many other coronal loops to obtain more statistically accurate values of these parameters .",
