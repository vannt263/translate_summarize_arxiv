    "sure , it is all about metro . the subway . the metropolitan underground railway system .",
    "each line has its own color and each color is the name of a line .",
    "a problem arises when another line is built : the old lines must keep their colors whereas the new line should have a color which looks maximally different from the old ones .",
    "it gets even more complicated if there are two or more new lines in a subway",
    ". not only the new colors must be unlike the old ones , but also they must differ from each other as much as possible .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a mathematical strategy to choose these colors . by the way , what new colors would _ you _ suggest for the real metro map in figure [ moskoumetro ] ? for our purposes",
    "this map is ideal : not only there are 14 colors in it , but also there will be several new lines built in that subway in the near future ( according to @xcite ) .",
    "let us take this map to illustrate our strategy  yet the reader can apply the techniques to whathever other map he or she likes .",
    "to maximize color differences  here , in metro maps  we need a way to measure them and argue about colors objectively . for this",
    "we describe them as tuples of numbers by using some coordinate system ( or _ color space _ ) . for examble ,",
    "the rgb color space is well - known : in it every color is encoded by its red , green , and blue components .",
    "unfortunately , in the rgb space the euclidean distance is not proportional to the visible distance that people perceive in between colors . that is , the rgb space is not _ perceptually uniform _  which we would like .",
    "in 1931 , the commission internationale de leclairage ( cie ) did measurements on vision of hundreds of humans . from those data ,",
    "several color spaces were created , to make communication about colors easy and unambiguous . in 1976",
    "the cie recommended the use of two approximately perceptually uniform color spaces and color - difference formulas .",
    "these spaces have become known by their officially recommended abbreviations cielab and cieluv . in the former ,",
    "a color is described by three coordinates : @xmath0 ( lightness ) , @xmath1 ( red - green scale ) and @xmath2 ( yellow - blue scale ) . and",
    "@xmath2 typically have values in the range -150 to 150 .",
    "in this article we will round the coordinates of the colors to integers .",
    "the human eye can discriminate up to ten million colors , so it can distinguish the differences even finer than integer steps .",
    "] we will use this space to describe the colors of the moscow metro map in terms of numbers : their cielab coordinates can be found in table [ tabelmoscowpoints ] ; figure [ 3dplaatje ] shows a stereographical plot of the colors of the moscow metro in the cielab space .",
    "the cielab space itself is not bounded ; however , based on what one wants to measure , only part of it matters in practice ( for example , only the colors that a printer can print or only the colors the human eye can see ) .",
    "such a subset of colors is called a color _ gamut_.",
    "the gamut of adobe 98 in the cielab space can be seen in figure [ gamutadobe ] . to keep the problem simple , we aproximate this gamut by a polyhedron . because the cielab space was supposed to be almost perceptually uniform , the cie 1976 color difference formula ( cie76 ) is given by the euclidean distance @xmath3 in fact ,",
    "the cielab space is not _ really _ uniform . in particular , at high values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the far too simple cie76 formula values color differences too stronly compared to the experimental results on color perception .",
    "this is why several new color - difference formulas were proposed , of which the newest is the ciede2000 formula .",
    "this means that we consider the difference in _ chroma _ @xmath4 and _ hue _ @xmath5arctan@xmath6 to be more important than the difference in lightness @xmath0 . for more information about this color difference formula ,",
    "see @xcite . ] ( or @xmath7 ) .",
    "-axis is the vertical axis , the @xmath1-axis runs from south - west to north - east and the @xmath2-axis from south - east to north - west .",

    "]    .coordinates of colors on the moscow metro map .",
    "the names of the colors come from @xcite .",
    "the average minimal distance is 16,3 .",
    "note that some of the minimal distnces are the same ; this happens when the two points are the closest to each other .",
    "[ cols=\">,<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we can also solve problem [ morecolors ] with respect to the euclidean distance by using the simplex method .",
    "let us consider here the case when the number of colors @xmath8 is two , which gives us the following function to maximize , @xmath9 we have @xmath10 .",
    "let us rewrite our problem : first , put one extra parameter @xmath11 and the two vectors @xmath12 together in @xmath13 , and now maximize the function @xmath14 over all @xmath15 satisfying the constraints    [ nonsmooth1 ] @xmath16    of course , more constraints on @xmath17 are used to delimit the set @xmath18 .",
    "now we use the simplex method to maximize our function .",
    "the gamut s boundary gives the linear constraints , and the nonlinear constraint functions are equations . because the simplex method gives us only a local optimum , we apply it for a million random initial points @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 ) .",
    "these are local optima with respect to the @xmath22 distance ; let us now choose the one with maximal @xmath7 distance .",
    "this way , we obtain the two colors @xmath23{0.49,0.94,0.90 } \\bullet } \\mbox {   ( 84 , -65 , -12 ) } \\quad \\mbox { and } \\quad \\mbox{baby pink   } { \\color[rgb]{1,0.74,0.8 } \\bullet } \\mbox {   ( 86 , 35 , 7)}.\\ ] ] their combined minimal ciede2000 distance to the old colors and each other is 22,7 .",
    "this is more than the minimal distance which was obtained after two steps of the one by one cie76-ciede2000 voronoi method .",
    "so this gives us a better result for solving problem [ morecolors ] .",
    "however , this method is quite time - consuming ( as @xmath8 increases , the simplex method will need even more time ) , so the much faster voronoi method is a good alternative .",
    "we conclude that the voronoi diagram method ( and its improvement by using both the cie76 and ciede2000 distance functions ) for adding new colors one by one gives solutions which are comparable with the ones produced by the nonsmooth optimization method for finding two or more new colors at once .",
    "this is true for the map of the moscow metro under study .",
    "other solution schemes are of course possible , e.g. the _ monte - carlo _ method : test points @xmath24 for the new color(s ) are generated within the gamut at random , and the new color  or a tuple of new colors  is the maximin optimum over a sufficiently large number of such attempts .",
    "the _ ballistic method _ is realized as follows : first , suppose that each old color @xmath25 and every new point @xmath26 in the sought - for tuple carries a positive electric charge ( so that they repulse by coulomb s law ) . to prevent an escape of new points from the gamut @xmath27 across its boundary ,",
    "put a negligibly small but positive charge at the boundary s closest point to @xmath26 for every @xmath28 . by starting from random initial data @xmath29 ,",
    "the configurations @xmath30 of charges evolve inside the polyhedron @xmath27 which , by assuption , is filled with a viscous medium so that the new points motion slows down ; sooner or later they are captured near the local minima of the potential ( see @xcite for details on both methods ) .",
    "finding several new colors is still not all that one needs in order to paint the new lines on a metro map .",
    "clearly , it is the configuration of transfers from the old to new lines that must further be taken into account  to distribute the new colors between the new lines in such a way that at every transfer station , the colors of intersecting lines are maximally different .      the 16.8 km long kozhukhovskaya line with eight stations on it is scheduled to appear in the moscow underground system in 2015 - 16 , officials say",
    ". the new line will connect the ( south-)east with the city centre .",
    "two colors , to freely choose from , were offered to pre - registered `` active citizens '' during an interactive poll , held from 20 october till 10 november 2014 .",
    "namely , _ black _ and _ pink _ were claimed to remain the only colors from the gamut that were not yet used to paint lines on the moscow metro map ( see figure [ moskoumetro ] ) .",
    "as many as 307,350 active citizens took part in the on - line poll , media report ; 71% voted pink and 18% preferred black , whereas 7% trusted the choice to experts ( such as designers , ethnographers , or psychologists ) .",
    "finally , 4% of the respondents either made their own suggestions of the new color : turquoise , olive , coral , etc .  or even proposed to make that line on the map speckled ( see @xcite ) .    permitting a large group of people ( here , 307,350 pre - registered active citizens ) to choose the new color(s ) from a given list of pre - selected variants ( here , two : black vs pink )",
    "might not always be the optimal strategy to resolve an important issue , painting new line(s ) on a metro map .",
    "perhaps , the decision should be trusted to the protector of tunnel builders and best friend of all cartographers ; then , the final choice is sometimes delegated to a child . alternatively , one could just ask a mathematician ."
