    "the index of @xmath0 is defined to be @xmath5 the lie algebra @xmath0 is _ frobenius _ if @xmath6 ; equivalently , if there is a functional @xmath1 such that @xmath7 is non - degenerate .",
    "frobenius lie algebras were first studied by ooms in @xcite where he proved that the universal enveloping algebra @xmath8 is primitive ( i.e.  admits a faithful simple module ) provided that @xmath0 is frobenius and that the converse holds when @xmath9 is algebraic .",
    "the relevance of frobenius lie algebras to deformation and quantum group theory stems from their relation to the classical yang - baxter equation ( cybe ) .",
    "suppose @xmath7 is non - degenerate and let @xmath10 be the matrix of @xmath11 relative to some basis @xmath12 of @xmath0 .",
    "belavin and drinfeld showed that @xmath13 is a ( constant ) solution of the cybe , see @xcite .",
    "thus , each pair consisting of a lie algebra @xmath0 together with functional @xmath1 such that @xmath2 is non - degenerate provides a solution to the cybe , see @xcite and @xcite for examples .",
    "the index of a semisimple lie algebra @xmath14 is equal to its rank and thus such algebras can never be frobenius",
    ". however , there always exist subalgebras of @xmath14 which are frobenius .",
    "in particular , many amongst the class of _ biparabolic _ subalgebras of @xmath14 are frobenius .",
    "a biparabolic subalgebra is the intersection of two parabolic subalgebras whose sum is @xmath14 .",

    ", panyushev developed an inductive procedure for computing the index of seaweed subalgebras , see @xcite .",
    "in the same paper , he exhibits a closed form for the index of a biparabolic subalgebra of @xmath16 .",
    "one may also see @xcite .",
    "tauvel and yu found in @xcite an upper bound for the index of a biparabolic subalgebra of an arbitrary semisimple lie algebra , and they conjectured that this was an equality .",
    "joseph proved the tauvel - yu conjecture in @xcite .",
    "the methods of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are all combinatorial in nature .",
    "yet even with the this theory available , it is difficult in practice to implement this theory to find families of frobenius biparabolic lie algebras .",
    "in contrast , for many cases it is known explicitly which biparabolic algebras have the maximum possible index .",
    "for example , the only biparabolics in @xmath17 and @xmath16 which have maximal index are the levi subalgebras . in contrast",
    ", the problem of determining the biparabolics of minimal index is an open question in all cases .",
    "our focus in this note is on the seaweed lie algebras ",
    "these are the biparabolic subalgebras of @xmath17 .",
    "the only known families of frobenius seaweed lie algebras that seem to be in the literature will be outlined in section [ sec : families ] , although the unpublished preprint @xcite may offer more examples .",
    "we shall examine these families using the meander graphs of dergachev and kirillov .",
    "our methodology provides new proofs that these algebras are indeed frobenius .",
    "we also exhibit a new infinite family of frobenius seaweed lie algebras in section  [ sec : submaximal ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the seaweed lie algebras of @xcite . recall that a composition of a positive integer @xmath18 is an unordered partition @xmath19 .",
    "that is , each @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be an @xmath18-dimensional vector space with a basis @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath24 be two compositions of @xmath18 and consider the flags @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the subalgebra of @xmath17 preserving these flags is called a seaweed lie algebra and is denoted @xmath28 .",
    "a basis - free definition is available but is not necessary for the present discussion .",
    "the name seaweed lie algebra was chosen due to their suggestive shape when exhibited in matrix form .",
    "for example , the algebra @xmath29 consists of traceless matrices of the form    @xmath30 where the entries marked by the dots are zero .",
    "many important subalgebras of @xmath17 are of seaweed type , as illustrated in the following example .",
    "[ seaweed - examples ]    * the entire algebra @xmath31 has index @xmath32 . *",
    "the cartan subalgebra of traceless diagonal matrices is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and has index @xmath32 .",
    "* the borel subalgebra is @xmath35 and has index @xmath36 . *",
    "a maximal parabolic subalgebra is of the form @xmath37 .",
    "elashvili proved in @xcite that its index is @xmath38 .",
    "the only explicitly known frobenius examples in the above list are the maximal parabolic algebras @xmath37 with @xmath39 and @xmath18 relatively prime .",
    "of course , another infinite family of frobenius seaweed algebras occurs when @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath18 is odd .",
    "a similar case is @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath18 is even .",
    "these two families are detailed in @xcite .",
    "a tantalizing question is how to classify which seaweed algebras are frobenius , especially given their importance in the general theory of lie algebras and applications to deformations and quantum groups .",
    "as stated earlier , dergachev and kirillov have developed a combinatorial algorithm to compute the index of an arbitrary @xmath44 from its associated _ meander _ graph @xmath45 determined by the compositions @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath48 consist of @xmath18 ordered points on a horizontal line , which can be called @xmath49 .",
    "the edges are arcs above and below the line connecting pairs of different vertices .",
    "more specifically , the composition @xmath50 determines arcs above the line which we will call the top edges .",
    "the component @xmath51 of @xmath46 determines @xmath52 arcs above vertices @xmath53 .",
    "the arcs are obtained by connecting vertex 1 to vertex @xmath51 , vertex 2 to vertex @xmath54 , and so on .",
    "if @xmath51 is odd then vertex @xmath55 has no arc above it . for the component @xmath56 of @xmath57",
    ", we do the same procedure over vertices @xmath58 , and continue with the higher @xmath59 .    the arcs corresponding to @xmath60 are drawn with the same rule but are under the line containing the vertices .",
    "these are called the bottom edges .",
    "it is easy to see that every meander consists of a disjoint union of cycles , paths , and isolated points , but not all of these are necessarily present in any given meander .",
    "the index of the lie algebra of seaweed type @xmath61 is equal to the number of connected components in the meander plus the number of closed cycles minus 1 .",
    "the presence of the minus one in the theorem is due to our use of seaweed subalgebras of @xmath17 rather than of @xmath62 as used by dergachev and kirillov @xcite",
    ". the index drops by one by the restriction to @xmath17 from @xmath62 .",
    "[ modified ] figure  [ meanderfig1 ] shows the meander @xmath45 corresponding to the compositions @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we see that there is a single path and a single cycle . using the theorem above",
    ", the index is @xmath65 .",
    "hence , @xmath66 is not a frobenius algebra .",
    "it is easy to see that to obtain a frobenius algebra , the only possibility for the meander is that it consist of a single path with no cycles and no isolated points .",
    "the following illustrates this point .",
    "[ examplea ] consider the algebra @xmath67 .",
    "its meander is given in figure  [ meanderfig2 ] .",
    "labeling the vertices with @xmath68 from left to right , notice that @xmath69 is the single path @xmath70 ( if we start with @xmath71 ) or its reversal @xmath72 if we start with @xmath73 .",
    "in particular , the index is @xmath74 and so this is a frobenius algebra .",
    "what are the conditions on the compositions @xmath46 and @xmath47 so that the meander @xmath45 consists of a single path with no cycles or isolated points ?    as stated , this seems to be an elementary question involving nothing more that the basics of graph theory .",
    "however , the apparent simplicity of the question is misleading since an answer would provide a complete classification of frobenius seaweed algebras - a difficult problem .",
    "even so , it is easy to give some necessary conditions on @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 to be a single path .",
    "for example , exactly two elements of the set @xmath78 must be odd .",
    "this is because a path must have a starting and ending point , and these corresponds to vertices of degree one .",
    "a vertex of degree one is either missing a top edge or bottom edge connecting to it , and this happens only if some @xmath59 or @xmath79 is odd .",
    "another necessary condition for @xmath80 to be a single path is that @xmath81 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath82 and thus @xmath83 is not frobenius since the index is additive for direct sums of lie algebras . more generally , if @xmath84 for some @xmath85 then the meander is not a single path .",
    "other necessary conditions can be given , but none seems to shed light on what is sufficient .",
    "in this section we revisit some known families of frobenius seaweed algebras in terms of meanders . at the end",
    "we also provide two new families .    first consider panyushev s example with @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath18 is odd . again , numbering as in example  [ examplea ] , the top edges connect 2 to 4 , 4 to 6 , etc .  while the bottom edges connect 1 to 3 , 3 to 5 , etc .",
    "hence , the meander consists of the single path @xmath88 . a similar argument verifies that the meander for @xmath89 and @xmath90 with @xmath18 even is also the path @xmath91 .",
    "suppose @xmath93 and @xmath94 are compositions of @xmath18 .",
    "the modified meander @xmath95 is the graph @xmath96 appended with a loop corresponding to each odd @xmath59 and @xmath79 . specifically , for all odd @xmath59 , add a loop connecting @xmath97 to itself .",
    "similarly , for all odd @xmath79 , add a bottom loop connecting @xmath98 to itself .",
    "each modified meander determines two bijections of @xmath102 to itself .",
    "define a `` top '' bijection @xmath103 of @xmath104 by @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the unique vertex incident with the same top edge as @xmath107 . if @xmath107 is joined to itself by a top loop , then @xmath108 . in a similar way ,",
    "define a `` bottom '' bijection @xmath109 of @xmath104 by @xmath110 , where @xmath106 is the unique vertex incident with the same bottom edge as @xmath106 . if @xmath107 is joined to itself by a bottom loop , then @xmath111 .",
    "clearly the maps @xmath103 and @xmath109 are well - defined . for instance , in example [ modified2 ] , we have @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "consider the meander permutation @xmath117 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 as in example  [ modified2 ] .",
    "we can write @xmath117 as a product of disjoint cycles in @xmath118 : @xmath119 ( note the different use of the term `` cycle '' ) .",
    "suppose the meander @xmath77 is the single path @xmath121 . by switching @xmath93 and @xmath94 if necessary",
    ", we can assume that @xmath122 .",
    "then the meander permutation is the @xmath18-cycle @xmath123 if @xmath18 is even and if @xmath18 is odd it is the @xmath18-cycle if @xmath124    conversely suppose @xmath117 is an @xmath18-cycle but @xmath96 is not a single path .",
    "then @xmath96 contains either an isolated point , a path of length less than @xmath18 , or a cycle .",
    "we shall show that each of these possibilities leads to a contradiction .",
    "if @xmath126 is a path in @xmath96 with @xmath127 then , depending on whether @xmath128 is even or odd , either the @xmath129 or @xmath130 appears in the cycle decomposition of @xmath117 .",
    "since @xmath127 we conclude that @xmath117 is not an @xmath18-cycle .    now if @xmath96 contains a cycle @xmath131 then the meander permutation contains either the @xmath132 cycle @xmath133 if @xmath18 is even or the @xmath128-cycle @xmath134 if @xmath18 is odd . if @xmath127 then @xmath117 is not an @xmath18-cycle .",
    "if @xmath135 is even , then the same argument shows that @xmath117 is not an @xmath18-cycle .",
    "the remaining case is that @xmath135 is odd . if this happens though , we must have @xmath136 , and consequently all components @xmath59 and @xmath79 are even .",
    "since @xmath137 we have a contradiction .",
    "thus , in all cases when @xmath96 is not a single path , the meander permutation @xmath117 is not an @xmath18-cycle , which is a contradiction .",
    "the proof is complete .",
    "recall elashvili s result asserting that the maximal parabolic algebra @xmath144 is frobenius if and only if @xmath145 . an immediate corollary of the previous lemma gives a new simple proof of elashvili s result .      by theorem [ cycle ]",
    "it suffices to show that the meander permutation is an @xmath18-cycle . according to lemma [ modn ] , @xmath146 for all @xmath107",
    "thus , the meander permutation is an @xmath18-cycle if and only if the sequence @xmath147 forms a complete residue system modulo @xmath18 .",
    "this occurs precisely when @xmath145 .",
    "the proof is complete .",
    "we now use the same ideas to present another family of frobenius seaweed algebras each of which is an intersection of a positive and negative maximal parabolic algebra .",
    "such algebras are of the form @xmath148 and are called _ opposite maximal parabolic subalgebras_.      the bottom and top maps are given by @xmath152 and @xmath153 there are four possible compositions @xmath154 , depending on and whether @xmath155 or @xmath156 and whether @xmath157 or @xmath158 .",
    "it is an easy calculation to see that in each case @xmath159 .",
    "the argument is exactly as that used in corollary  [ relprime ] .",
    "namely , that the meander permutation is an @xmath18-cycle if and only if the sequence @xmath162 is a complete residue system modulo @xmath18 , and this is the case if and only if @xmath161 .      at this time , the above line of reasoning does not easily extend to compositions @xmath93 and @xmath94 with more than two components . however , some calculations offer hope of producing more families of frobenius lie algebras using methods similar to those above .",
    "we conclude with another new family of frobenius algebras . these are of the form @xmath166 , so they are parabolic algebras omitting exactly two simple roots .",
    "we use a different technique than for maximal or opposite maximal algebras to analyze this family .",
    "our result is the following classification theorem .",
    "we first establish some conditions on the degrees of the vertices @xmath168 of the meander @xmath169 .",
    "since the vertices of @xmath10 are viewed as the numbers @xmath170 on a line the _ interval _ between vertices @xmath171 and @xmath172 makes sense .",
    "suppose for a moment that there exists a vertex @xmath174 of degree @xmath175 .",
    "this vertex must have no bottom edge , meaning that @xmath18 is odd and @xmath176 .",
    "we also know @xmath174 has no top edge so @xmath109 is odd and @xmath174 is halfway between @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "this implies that @xmath179 so @xmath180 , a contradiction .",
    "hence , we get exactly one vertex of degree @xmath173 for each integer in @xmath181 which is odd .",
    "if @xmath18 is odd , the vertex @xmath182 has degree @xmath173 .",
    "if all three of @xmath39 , @xmath109 and @xmath183 are odd , then @xmath184 and @xmath185 are both even , meaning they have a common factor of @xmath71 , a contradiction .",
    "this implies that exactly one of @xmath39 , @xmath109 or @xmath183 must be odd .",
    "then there is exactly one other vertex of degree one as desired .",
    "if @xmath18 is even , the bottom edges form a perfect matching .",
    "if all three of @xmath39 , @xmath109 and @xmath183 are even , then @xmath184 and @xmath185 are again even , a contradiction .",
    "this implies that exactly two of @xmath39 , @xmath109 or @xmath183 are odd , meaning there are two vertices of degree @xmath173 as desired .    by lemma [ twoones ] , one component of @xmath10",
    "must be a path and there are possibly more components which are all cycles .",
    "let @xmath186 be this path and suppose @xmath186 has @xmath187 vertices in the first part of the partition , and @xmath188 and @xmath189 vertices in the other parts respectively .",
    "note that one of @xmath190 or @xmath191 may be zero .",
    "label the vertices of @xmath186 with @xmath192 where latexmath:[$n ' =    @xmath171 ) of the vertices .",
    "notice that the path @xmath186 forms a meander graph on its own .",
    "this means that , by the proof of lemma [ twoones ] , we know that exactly two of the integers in @xmath194 are even and two are odd .",
    "now suppose there exists at least one component of @xmath10 that is a cycle .",
    "let @xmath195 be the set of all vertices in cycles of @xmath10 .",
    "suppose @xmath195 has @xmath196 vertices in the interval between @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "for the moment , let us suppose that @xmath199 .",
    "following the bottom edges , this means that @xmath195 must also have @xmath196 vertices in the interval between @xmath200 and @xmath201 . using this argument",
    ", we will show that @xmath195 has @xmath196 vertices in almost every interval .",
    "define a _ dead end _ in @xmath10 to be an interval @xmath197 to @xmath198 such that @xmath10 contains an edge joining @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath204 is even , then the interval between @xmath205 and @xmath206 is a dead end .",
    "a dead end is formed by two consecutive vertices of @xmath186 which are adjacent .",
    "each occurrence of a dead end coincides with one of @xmath207 or @xmath204 being even , and we know that exactly two of these are even",
    ". thus , there are exactly two dead ends and the proof is complete .",
    "call an interval a _ partition interval _ if it is the meeting point of two parts of our partition .",
    "namely , the partition intervals are from @xmath208 to @xmath209 and from @xmath210 to @xmath211 . now suppose @xmath195 has @xmath196 vertices in the interval from @xmath197 to @xmath198 . for the moment",
    "we suppose this interval is not a dead end . as mentioned before",
    ", this means that , by following bottom edges , @xmath195 must also have @xmath196 vertices in the interval from @xmath200 to @xmath201 .",
    "also , by following top edges , @xmath195 must have @xmath196 vertices in another interval ( depending where the top edges go ) .",
    "if the interval from @xmath197 to @xmath198 happens to be one of the two partition intervals ( for example suppose @xmath212 ) then this means @xmath195 must have @xmath213 vertices in the interval outside @xmath214 and at least @xmath215 vertices in the interval from @xmath210 to @xmath211 where @xmath216 .",
    "this then implies that @xmath195 has @xmath213 vertices in the interval beyond @xmath217 ( following bottom edges ) and another @xmath213 vertices in the interval from @xmath210 to @xmath218 ( following top edges ) for a total of @xmath196 vertices in the interval @xmath210 to @xmath218 .",
    "see figure  [ meanderfig ] for an example . in this figure ,",
    "the dark lines represent the edges of @xmath186 while light lines represent edges of @xmath195 .",
    "the unlabeled light lines represent @xmath196 edges each . here",
    "@xmath219 , @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "alternating following top and bottom edges , we see that the cycle @xmath195 has exactly @xmath196 vertices in every interval between vertices and possibly @xmath223 vertices on each end beyond @xmath214 and beyond @xmath224 . carefully counting",
    ", we see that the first part of our partition has @xmath225 vertices . similarly , the second part has @xmath226 and the third part has @xmath227 .",
    "this means that @xmath228 and @xmath229 and these have a common factor of @xmath230 , a contradiction .",
    "this shows that @xmath195 must be empty so @xmath231 is simply the path @xmath186 .",
    "here we have broken the top into @xmath233 pieces while leaving the bottom in one piece . notice that we can add a cycle to this structure which does not pass through all the intervals .",
    "this happens because , as the number of pieces we have increases , the number of dead ends also increases , allowing more flexibility in the placement of the cycles .",
    "the above illustrates the complexity of the meander graphs @xmath96 as the number of parts of @xmath93 and @xmath94 grow . at the moment , the problem of classifying all frobenius seaweed lie algebras seems to be out of reach .",
