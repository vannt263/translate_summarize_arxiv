    "the interpretation of spectra of baryons is still a thriving field that is attracting much attention .",
    "the traditional view of baryons as made of three constituent quarks  @xcite is being substituted by a more extended view of baryonic states involving three quark @xmath9 as well as four quark - one antiquark @xmath10 components . in particular",
    "some baryonic resonances ( a paradigmatic case is the @xmath11 may be better interpreted as molecular states of mesons and baryons . though such ideas have been advocated in the past @xcite , it has only been in recent years that detailed quantitative studies have been done based on the combination of chiral dynamics with unitary nonperturbative techniques in coupled channels of mesons and baryons .",

    "more technically , they are dynamically generated from the interaction of the octet of mesons containing the @xmath14 and the octet of baryons including the proton .",
    "similarly , the interaction of the octet of mesons of the @xmath14 with the baryon decuplet of the @xmath15 leads to dynamically generated states of @xmath16 , which can be associated to existing resonances  @xcite . a further step in this molecular engineering",
    "is done with the study of @xmath17 states stemming from the interaction of a pair of pseudoscalar mesons with a baryon of the octet of the nucleon @xcite , corresponding indeed to @xmath18 components .",
    "a common denominator of these generated baryon states is the use of pseudoscalar mesons as building blocks .",
    "here we undertake the task of extending the study of the dynamical generation of resonances to the vector meson - baryon sector .",
    "besides having its own interest as an extension of the theoretical formalism , this study is particularly relevant in this moment from a phenomenological point of view since there are clear indications that @xmath19 components @xcite as well as @xmath0 ( @xmath20 ones @xcite may play an essential role in the precise description of the negative parity @xmath15 spectrum below @xmath21 gev .",
    "a framework that makes the study of vector mesons interacting with baryons accurate and manageable is the hidden gauge formalism @xcite .",
    "there , pseudoscalars and vectors are introduced with an interaction which respects chiral symmetry .",
    "the consideration of the interaction of vector mesons with baryons allows then to reinterpret the pseudoscalar meson - baryon chiral lagrangians as the result of the exchange of vector mesons in the t - channel .",
    "the novelty of such a framework is that it also contains the coupling of vector mesons among themselves and therefore one can construct their interaction with baryons .",

    "the strength of the interaction indicates that the @xmath103 state is more bound than the @xmath104 .",

    "this has to do with the more attractive interaction for @xmath103 , so that the more bound the sate the more uncertain the prediction of its mass .",

    "@xcite these channels are supposed to play a minor role as building blocks of the resonance since they are far apart in energy from the masses of the states obtained . however , given the fact that there is more phase space for the decay into these channels , they can have some contribution to the total width .",
    "one should note though that the inclusion of the width hardly changes the position of the peaks .",
    "in the previous sections we mentioned that we do not have contributions from either @xmath126 or @xmath127 transitions within the vector exchange approach of our model . yet it is possible to have @xmath128 intermediate states through anomalous terms involving the @xmath129 transition . the contribution to @xmath80 from intermediate @xmath128 states",

    "this is easy to understand by realizing that even enlarging the @xmath194 interval the mass of the closest @xmath195 pdg resonances would be far above or below our predicted masses .",
    "moreover as the change of the prediction over the whole interval is very modest , going from @xmath112 mev to @xmath113 mev , there can only have a little effect on the probability of the @xmath0 component in the assigned resonance .",
    "for @xmath103 the greater sensitivity of the predicted masses to changes in the cutoff values ( from @xmath28 mev to @xmath115 mev in the considered @xmath194 interval ) might leave room for an alternative assignment although a quick look to the pdg catalog also locates the next @xmath196 resonance , @xmath197 very far above our predicted masses .",

    "in such a case the @xmath209 @xmath190 and @xmath188 should consistently not contain a @xmath0 component .",
    "we have performed a study of the @xmath0 interaction within the framework of the hidden gauge formalism for vector mesons and a unitary approach via the use of the bethe salpeter equation .",
    "we find that the interaction potential for the @xmath45 and @xmath15 is attractive in @xmath103 and @xmath104 and repulsive in @xmath85 channels .",

    "it is interesting to observe that , even if the @xmath0 structure allows for @xmath85 , the dynamics of the problem precludes the formation of bound states .",
    "note that an @xmath85 bound state would be exotic since a three quark structure does not allow such an isospin to appear .",
    "we also find the @xmath0 interaction with @xmath103 to be stronger than with @xmath104 , leading to @xmath1 states more bound that the @xmath2 ones .",
    "the other dynamical feature of the model is the spin degeneracy in @xmath7 of both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states .",
    "this is a consequence of the approximations done , corresponding to the @xmath0 interaction in @xmath210 wave , neglecting the three momentum of the vector mesons .",

    "when it comes to compare our results with existing resonances , we find for @xmath2 a good quantitative agreement with @xmath167 @xmath168 and @xmath211 the small sensitivity of the predicted masses to changes in the cutoff parameter used in our calculation added to the lack of alternative identifications with existing data takes us to unambiguously assign our @xmath0 bound states to these resonances .",
    "for @xmath170 the much larger mass predicted by @xmath29 models makes clear that it contains almost exclusively a @xmath0 component . for @xmath175 and @xmath176 the presence of a @xmath29 radial excitation not far above in energy could leave room for a significant probability of this component .",
    "concerning @xmath1 we find again a good quantitative agreement of our predicted masses with @xmath179 @xmath180 and @xmath212 the analysis of @xmath29 models predictions makes clear that with this assignment each of these experimental @xmath1 resonances would come out from the overlapping of two different states containing both @xmath29 as well as @xmath0 components .",
    "however the close mass of these two states and the possible existence of additional components in them would make difficult their experimental disentanglement .",
    "alternatively another assignment is possible .",
    "the larger sensitivity of the predicted masses to changes in the cutoff could make feasible in this case the assignment to non - cataloged @xmath206 resonances which would be hidden in the cataloged @xmath197 @xmath200 and @xmath213    therefore we conclude that the @xmath169 can be interpreted as @xmath0 bound state and that the @xmath214 and @xmath168 contain a significant probability of the @xmath0 component providing an explanation to the elusive description of these resonances by @xmath29 models . in the @xmath103 sector although an assignment of our @xmath0 bound states to @xmath215 @xmath180 and @xmath216 can be done it would be also possible to associate them to non cataloged @xmath1 states around 1900 mev .",
    "certainly a refinement of our results , from a more complete calculation incorporating @xmath29 altogether with meson - baryon components in a consistent manner , could be more predictive in this case .",
