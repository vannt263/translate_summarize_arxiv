    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) is a very complex entity .",
    "it is extremely rich in structure , highly turbulent , and embedded in a dynamically important magnetic field .",
    "although the concept of `` phases '' is up for debate @xcite , we can safely say that the ism shows regions of distinct physical conditions , which range from cold and molecular , to hot and ionized .",
    "a factor that controls the structure of the ism to a large extent , is the balance between heating and cooling processes . in this work ,",
    "we are mainly concerned with the interfaces between the _ hot _ ( @xmath5k ) and _ warm _ ( @xmath6k ) media , as well as the transfer of heat between them . at temperatures in between the hot and warm media the efficiency of radiative cooling",
    "is maximal ( see * ? ? ?",
    "material at such temperatures cools very quickly , therefore should be rarely observed .",
    "however , absorption line studies in the far ultraviolet ( fuv ) have found otherwise ( e. g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting substantial amounts of plasma at temperatures of @xmath7k .",
    "it was realized by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bf90 ) , that the interfaces between hot and warm media might well be dominated by `` turbulent mixing layers '' .",
    "the general idea was that turbulence produces an exchange of material and energy at the boundary between the two media , providing a steady supply of plasma at @xmath8k , balancing the losses due to radiation .",
    "later , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ssb93 ) predicted that line ratios of highly ionized species ( , , , and ) differ significantly from those in purely photoionized gas , radiative shocks , and conduction fronts , thus providing a useful diagnostic tool of the physical conditions in turbulent mixing layers .",
    "their model however , relied on several simplifying assumptions .",
    "for instance they characterized the mixing layer with a single mean temperature @xmath9 , regardless of the position in the mixing layer .",
    "the model is one - dimensional , unmagnetized , and parameters were chosen to correspond observations .",
    "the obvious requirement for this type of heat transport is the development of turbulence at the boundary of the two media . in the ism",
    "there are many outflows and plasma instabilities that can lead to this situation .",
    "for example , in a supernova explosion rayleigh - taylor instabilities occur when the hot and low - density ejecta tries to accelerate a colder and denser medium .",
    "this produces a boundary layer that breaks up into small ( colder ) high density clumps left inside a hot cavity .",
    "another physical process that can lead to a turbulent mixing layer is the kelvin - helmholtz ( k - h ) instability , which can occur when shear is present between two fluids .",
    "this is possible , for instance , at the edges of high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) moving through the galactic hot corona ( see * ? ? ?",
    "however , the presence of a magnetic field can influence the dynamics of the k - h instability .",
    "it is well known that flows with an alfvn speed less than the shear velocity can become stable ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "a detailed numerical study of the k - h instability can be found in @xcite .",
    "enhancement of thermal difussivity in magnetized plasmas due to turbulent motions is discussed in @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we study the formation and evolution of turbulent mixing layers by means of the k - h instability .",
    "we use a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) code , which includes radiative cooling .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in  2 we provide with a brief review of the theory behind turbulent mixing layers , in  3 we describe the code and our numerical setup .",
    "the results , including estimates of column densities and line ratios of highly ionized species can be found in  4 , followed by a summary in  5 .",
    "the idea of a turbulent mixing layer was proposed in bf90 as an important heat transfer mechanism between two media at different temperatures .",
    "the basic picture proposed is that turbulence at the boundary of the two fluids will provide a constant input to the intermediate temperature mixture . if energy is conserved , this mixing layer would grow indefinitely , and eventually all of the material will be at such intermediate temperature . to prevent this they proposed a steady state",
    "in which the energy lost by radiation ( radiative cooling is most efficient precisely at such intermediate temperatures ) is balanced by a turbulent heat flux into the mixing layer . as it is usual , most of the energy in the turbulence is on the largest scales , and cascaded down to a dissipative level .",
    "thus the model of bf90 is basically a three - phase steady state fluid in which the losses due to radiation are balanced with energy entrained by turbulence into the intermediate temperature zone . in their model ,",
    "the temperature of the mixing layer is determined by mass flux balance : @xmath10 where , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mass flux rates from the hot and from the cold phase into the layer , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the temperatures of the hot and cold phases respectively . since neither the heat transfer nor the mixing will be perfect , bf90 introduced two efficiency factors : @xmath15 , the fraction of mass and energy that is deposited by the hot medium to the mixing layer , and @xmath16 , an efficiency for the hydrodynamic mixing . with these factors",
    "the mass flux rates become @xmath17 and the resulting intermediate temperature will be : @xmath18 \\left(t_{cold}\\,t_{hot}\\right)^{1/2}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & \\xi \\left(t_{cold}\\,t_{hot}\\right)^{1/2}. \\label{eq : tbar2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the definition of the two different efficiencies reveals what the authors had in mind as the mechanism that provides the mixing .",
    "the efficiency associated with the entrainment of hot gas simply corresponds to an enthalpy flux @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the pressure and @xmath21 the turbulent velocity .",
    "this yields eq.([eq : mdot_hot ] ) , where @xmath22 is the mass density of the hot medium and the contribution of turbulent kinetic energy has been neglected .",
    "the cold gas is then pulled into the hot medium by turbulent eddies at a rate @xmath23 .",
    "turbulent eddies are formed on scales @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the total thickness of the layer , and @xmath26 can be thought as an eddy turnover time for eddies of size @xmath27 .",
    "bf90 used the kelvin - helmholtz growth rate @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the mass density of the cold medium , leading to eq.([eq : mdot_cold ] ) .",
    "however , the form of the timescale @xmath30 is not exclusive for the k - h instability but suitable for fully developed turbulence in general .",
    "the main uncertainty in the bf90 model lies in these efficiency factors .",
    "it is also derived assuming fully developed turbulence ( i.e. rapid mixing ) , and therefore does not include the effects of cooling to the dynamical development of turbulence .",
    "later , ssb93 expanded on the ideas of bf90 and ran a grid of models based on one - dimensional , instantaneous , steady - state mixing , characterized principally by @xmath9 , and @xmath21 .",
    "these included the effects of non - equilibrium ionization and self - photoionization of the gas in the mixing layer , but adopted a somewhat ad hoc value for @xmath31 and the efficiencies ( @xmath32 s ) .    in this work we focus on the dynamical formation and development of the mixing layer .",
    "we do not include effects of non - equilibrium or self - photoionization , but we measure the the actual @xmath9 , which is result a continuous distribution of temperatures that range from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , we will call it @xmath33 because our choice of parameters are to coincide with the _ warm _ phase of the ism ( at @xmath1 ) . ] instead of fixing any efficiency factor .",
    "we solve the following system of equations : @xmath34 with @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 is the mass density , @xmath37 is the velocity , @xmath20 is the pressure , and @xmath38 the magnetic field .",
    "we use an ideal gas equation of state @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the ratio of the specific heats ( @xmath41 ) , and @xmath42 is the specific internal energy .",
    "we solve equations ( [ eq : rho])-([eq : mag ] ) using a muscl - type scheme with hll fluxes @xcite and monotonized central limiter ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , on a regular cartesian grid .",
    "we use the the flux - interpolated constrained transport ( or  flux - ct \" ) scheme @xcite to enforce the divergence free condition of the magnetic field .",
    "a similar version of the code was used by @xcite for relativistic mhd calculations .",
    "our code gives satisfactory results for standard shock tube tests ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when compared with our earlier hybrid eno code ( see an isothermal version in @xcite ) , our current code runs faster , and yet gives consistent results .",
    "the overall scheme is second - order accurate .",
    "after updating the system of equations along @xmath43 direction , we repeat similar procedures for @xmath44 and @xmath45 directions , with the appropriate rotation of indexes .",
    "we use a two - stage runge - kutta method for time integration .",
    "the cooling at a given temperature is assumed to be of that of plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium , with solar metallicity , as given in @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath46 , and solve the time evolution of specific internal energy .",
    "for the runs with cooling , this is applied before updating equations ( [ eq : rho])-([eq : mag ] ) , using an implicit scheme ( i.e. we simply subtract the internal energy that will be lost in the time - step @xmath47 ) .",
    "we do not explicitly include heating due to absorption of radiation or thermal conduction .",
    "the time - step for the mhd part is determined by the standard `` courant '' condition .",
    "when we include cooling , we monitor the minimal cooling time in the computational box and compare it with that of the mhd part .",
    "if the minimum cooling time is shorter , it replaces the time - step .",
    "however , this was very rarely the case , and typically the dynamical time was shorter than the cooling time ( by one or two orders of magnitude in most cases ) .",
    "we do not include thermal conduction explicitly .",
    "the diffusion of heat at small scales is determined in our simulations by the numerical diffusion , whose properties may be different from those of diffusion in the actual interstellar gas",
    ". however , this does not greatly affect our final results if the heat transport is determined by turbulence .",
    "a discussion about turbulent and thermal conduction in a magnetized medium can be found in @xcite .",
    "turbulence provides an effective diffusion coefficient @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the turbulent velocity , and @xmath50 is the scale of energy injection , corresponding to the size of the largest eddies @xcite .",
    "we will see that in our models the injection scale is utterly determined by the size of our computational box .",
    "if the turbulent diffusion coefficient is much larger than the thermal diffusion coefficient the heat transfer is dominated by turbulence .",
    "an important property of turbulent heat transfer , as well as the other transport processes , is that they do not depend on the microscopic diffusivity .",
    "indeed , provided that the gas is turbulent , the mixing and the heat transport are happening approximately over one large eddy turnover time .",
    "if the diffusivity on the atomic level decreases , the turbulent cascade goes to yet smaller scales ensuring heat transport that still scales as above . for typical parameters of turbulent mixing layers in our models ( that is @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) , one obtains a spitzer thermal diffusion coefficient of @xmath55 and a turbulent diffusion coefficient of @xmath56",
    "the difference is modest , however the presence of a magnetic field will further suppress thermal conduction .",
    "moreover , the magnetic field does not have to be dynamically dominant to produce an important effect on the thermal conductivity . and , in some sense , our unmagnetized models are equivalent to models with a very weak magnetic field ( ubiquitous in the ism ) , that is sufficient to suppress thermal conductivity significantly . at the beginning of the simulations turbulence",
    "is not fully developed and the turbulent diffusivity is small , but at the same time the magnetic field is aligned with the interface , dramatically decreasing electron conduction as well . at more evolved stages however , turbulence will develop and thermal conduction will be less suppressed as the magnetic field becomes entangled .",
    "estimates by @xcite suggest that for fully developed turbulence the thermal conductivity is decreased by a factor of @xmath57 from the spitzer value .",
    "their model is , however , rather restrictive as only turbulence with alfvn mach number ( @xmath58 ) equal to unity is discussed . for both @xmath58 much larger , and much smaller than unity",
    "the electron thermal conductivity is less ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we start with warm gas , at a temperature of @xmath59 , with a relatively high hydrogen number density @xmath60 , and no mean motion , at the right side of the computational box . at the opposite side",
    "we have a low - density ( @xmath61 ) , hot medium ( @xmath13 ) , moving upward ( @xmath62 direction ) with a velocity @xmath63 .",
    "in some of our simulations we include a magnetic field @xmath64 threading the warm gas aligned in the vertical direction , with a magnitude corresponding to a @xmath65 .",
    "a sketch of the computational domain is presented in figure [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "the two media are initially in total pressure equilibrium . the transition region ( between hot and warm media ) follows a hyperbolic tangent profile in the @xmath66 direction , that initially occupies @xmath67th . of the box size .",
    "the division line for the runs in a @xmath68 grid was set at the middle of the box .",
    "the vertical direction in all cases correspond to a physical scale of @xmath69 . in the cases without cooling ,",
    "the simulations can be rescaled arbitrarily , but when cooling is included the scale lengths are fixed by the value of the cooling rate used .",
    "the boundary conditions are periodic in the @xmath62 and @xmath70 directions . for the @xmath66 direction in the warm side of the box ( right )",
    "we have a reflective boundary , and on the hot side ( left ) we have a source boundary condition .",
    "the latter reinforces the initial condition after each time - step , acting as a reservoir of hot material , that helps to balance the energy lost trough radiation .",
    "we initialized the computational cube with sinusoidal perturbations ( @xmath71 harmonics , with random phases ) in the component of the velocity normal to the interface of the two media ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the shear at the boundary , will excite a k - h instability , which will eventually lead to the development of turbulence .",

    "our models , as described in the previous section , are dynamical and include a continuous transition between the _ hot _ and the _ warm _ media . in order to compare the result of our calculations with previous models of turbulent mixing layers ( ssb93 ) we have to define what a region of `` intermediate temperature '' is , in our computational box .",
    "we adopted a threshold of @xmath86 departure from any of the nominal temperatures for the hot and warm media .",
    "that is , we consider in the transition region all material above @xmath87 , and below @xmath88 for the runs where @xmath89 ; or bellow @xmath90 for the runs with @xmath91 .",

    "the density weighted temperature is more robust against the particular choice of threshold . and",
    ", since the emission observable is also density weighted , it is a better measure of the properties of mixing layers , and we will use it to interpret our results . keeping in mind that the temperature in bf90 and ssb93 is a simple volume average , and that denser regions correspond to lower temperatures , our density weighted temperature will in general be lower . in our approach",
    "we do not assume a particular value for the efficiencies `` @xmath32 s , and/or @xmath31 '' , instead they are being implicitly calculated . in principle they can be measured from the simulations , however , it would require the choice of an arbitrary temperature threshold to obtain a mean ( volume average ) temperature , which turns out to be very sensitive to such threshold .",
    "thus , it is impractical to compare the models through estimates of the efficiencies      using a density weighted average , our calculations show a relatively cold boundary layer ( of a few @xmath93 ) at the early stages of formation . due to the fact that the mass is initially on the warm side ,",
    "this indicates a somewhat inefficient mixing at such early times .",
    "figures [ fig : t_ev_b0]_b _ , and [ fig : t_ev_b1]_b _ show how the mixing layer develops .",
    "when we do not include cooling , the thickness of the boundary layer increases monotonically .",
    "the growth rate is faster when the shear velocity is larger , as expected for the k - h instability . for the cases",
    "in which cooling is included , we see a very different evolution , with the boundary layer shrinking with time at the beginning , and after some time starting to grow again .",
    "the smallest perturbations in the k - h instability have the fastest growth rate , but do not have the required energy to pull ( enough ) material into the mixing interface .",
    "since the cooling is very effective , the transition layer is rather sharp . at this point",
    ", we mostly have warm gas being condensed at the interface , but mixing is not very effective yet .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ fig : snapshots1 ] , where we show cuts perpendicular to the mixing layer ( @xmath94 plane ) in two of our simulations after @xmath95 .",
    "+   +    the cases with magnetic field do not show significant differences in the formation of the mixing layer when compared with the unmagnetized runs at early times ( @xmath96 myr ) .    in order to test the sensitivity of our simulations to resolution we ran a couple of cases in a @xmath78 grid .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : hi_res ] .",
    "we found marginal dependence on numerical resolution for the formation of the mixing layers .",
    "we will see however , that the mixing at later times is utterly dominated by the largest scales , when the modes that correspond to the longest wavelengths excited by the instability become apparent .",
    "up until now , we have seen the formation of turbulent mixing layers by means of a k - h instability . however , we have not seen evidence of reaching a steady state , which is the original idea of the whole process . since the largest modes in the k - h instability grow rather slowly , it is not practical to follow the evolution of all our models until steady state is achieved . moreover , in a qualitative way , we have observed similar behavior for the runs that started with a larger temperature ( @xmath97 ) , but with the additional difficulty that we require finer time stepping for such cases , making it very difficult to cover a large span in time . to study the long - term evolution of the layer , we followed the the fastest evolving model .",
    "that is , the unmagnetized , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 model .",
    "a related problem in our @xmath68 resolution runs was that by the time the mixing layer was reaching its asymptotic state ( after @xmath100 ) , it was getting very close to the boundary of the computational box . to overcome this problem we extended the dimensions of the box to @xmath101 cells in the @xmath66 direction , and we placed the division between hot and warm media off - center .",
    "the new initial conditions ( `` lx - th6-v200-b0 '' in table [ tb : param ] ) have only @xmath102th of the volume filled with warm gas , and the remainder with hot gas .",
    "this is because we have much more heat capacity in the warm gas ( due to the density contrast ) , and because our simulations did not have enough hot gas to provide a steady state .",

    "we also show snapshots of cuts perpendicular to the layer , after @xmath103 in figure [ fig : snapshots2 ] .",

    "nonetheless , our results provide important insights on how these mixing layers will develop and change over time .",
    "notably , the time evolution we observe for these mixing layers are associated with a significant evolution of spectral line diagnostics , most importantly the column densities and ratios of highly ionized species .",
    "these measurements depend not only on the metallicity , density contrast , and relative velocities of the mixing zones , but also on the evolutionary state of the layer . as a first step towards examining the evolution , we have calculated the column densities of , , and ions through our simulated layers as a function of time . using the temperature and density profile along synthetic lines - of - sight ( loss ) through the data cube , chosen perpendicularly to the boundary layer ( in the direction of the @xmath66 axis ) .",
    "these column densities were computed under the assumption of solar metallicity , and collisional ionization equilibrium @xcite .",

    ", mixing layers can be quite far from equilibrium .",
    "the overall dynamics and time evolution of mixing layers is not likely to change dramatically by non - equilibrium effects .",
    "however , observational diagnostics such as line ratios can be affected significantly .",
    "a study of non - equilibrium cooling models with more emphasis on the observational implications is necessary and we plan to provide it in a following paper .",
    "it is interesting that a clear difference is present between the runs that include cooling and those that do not .",
    "however , note that except for the `` lx - th6-v200 '' runs , the mixing layer is still in a very early stage of formation .",
    "it is remarkable that the models without cooling show similarity to the results of ssb93 .",
    "certainly their models did not account for the dynamical effect of the cooling : their model provides the intermediate temperatures , but the mixing is merely hydrodynamical .",
    "condensation or evaporating flows were not considered . at the same time , their model also assumed fully developed turbulence , and our set of runs have not achieved the corresponding stationary state .    with new models",
    ", observations may be able to provide insights about the time - dependence of the mixing .",
    "another thing to notice is the larger scatter for the cases that have been run for longer times .",
    "this scatter can be explained noting that for longer timescales we have a more dynamical ( turbulent ) picture , with many structures moving in and out of a particular los .",
    "actually , the values of the / , / ratios ( and the rather large scatter ) , are somewhat consistent with the observations presented by @xcite .",
    "is is also evident that in the magnetized cases the k - h instability ( and therefore the development of turbulence at the boundary ) is delayed .",
    "this can be seen from the smaller scatter of points in figure [ fig : ratios_b1 ] compared to those in [ fig : ratios ] .",
    "however , magnetic reconnection should not allow the magnetic field to form knots and prevent turbulent mixing motions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it remains difficult to reconcile the models with high ion column densities .",
    "it has been pointed out ( e.g. ssb93 ; @xcite ) , that to explain the typical column densities observed , the los must pass through several mixing layers ( sometimes as many as a hundred )",
    ". indeed , several interfaces are likely to be blended for long lines - of - sight ( as in the case of observations in the halo of the galaxy ) . however , in many cases fairly smooth and symmetrical line profiles , with little centroid dispersions are observed .",
    "this evidence indicates that merely summing over a large number of interfaces may not explain the observed column densities . in table",

    "we use a mhd code with radiative cooling , to model the formation and evolution of turbulent mixing layers through this instability .",
    "the introduction of cooling in to the dynamical evolution was found to produce dramatic differences compared with the same models ran without cooling .",
    "for instance , the deposition of momenta from hot gas condensing onto the mixing layer modifies the growth - rate of the k - h instability , making it develop faster than the same case run without cooling .",
    "the low density of the hot medium caused the growth rate of the large scale modes of the instability to be slow .",
    "at early stages of the formation of the mixing layer ( @xmath148 ) the rapid cooling of material at intermediate temperatures ( @xmath149 ) makes for a sharp transition between the hot and warm media .    at later times , the instability excites large scale fluctuations that are powerful enough to provide more efficient mixing , and the transition zone broadens . we see evidence that for typical ism conditions ( @xmath150 and @xmath151 , with a shear velocity of @xmath152 ) , the mixing layer is still growing after @xmath153 .",
    "we included a dynamically important magnetic field ( @xmath154 ) in the warm phase for some runs , and its effect was found to be minimal at earlier times @xmath155 myr . at later times",
    "the magnetic field inhibits / delays the development of the k - h instability , and thus the turbulent mixing .    assuming solar metallicities , and collisional ionization equilibrium fractions , we estimated column densities and line ratios of highly ionized species ( , , and ) from our simulations .",
    "we compared our results with previous models ( ssb93 ) of turbulent mixing layers and found similar column densities .",
    "the / , and / mean line ratios are slightly different , with a lower /.",
    "we also found a significant scatter between different lines - of - sight , in particular for the models evolved to longer times .",
    "we were not able to fully reach a stationary state in our simulations , however our results suggest that given more time ( @xmath156 for typical conditions ) , the column density of high ions should be significantly larger than previous models , partially alleviating the problem of number of layers required to explain observations ."
