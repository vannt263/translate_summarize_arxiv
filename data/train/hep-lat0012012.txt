    "recently , there has been a considerable interest in qcd at non - zero chemical potential , after a number of model studies have indicated a rich phase structure @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) . clearly",
    ", it would be desirable if these predictions could be tested by first - principles , non - perturbative studies , e.g.  lattice qcd . unfortunately , lattice simulations of qcd at non - zero baryon density using standard methods are in practice impossible because the action ( and the fermion determinant ) becomes complex once the chemical potential is introduced , causing importance sampling to fail .",
    "it is possible to split the determinant into a modulus and a phase , simulating with the modulus of the determinant as the measure and reweighting the observables with the phase , @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the expectation value with respect to the positive real measure .",
    "however , the denominator in ( [ eq : obs ] ) is effectively the ratio of the partition functions of two different theories : the true theory and one with a positive real measure .",
    "this should scale as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the difference in free energy between the two theories . since the free energy is an extensive quantity , the computational effort required to obtain a reliable sample rises exponentially with the volume .",
    "a number of approaches have been tried to overcome this problem . in the hamiltonian formalism",
    ", the problem does not arise .",
    "analytical results have been obtained in the strong coupling limit @xcite , but so far no method for numerical simulations exists .    with an imaginary chemical potential @xcite , the action becomes real and positive , so simulations are straightforward .",
    "the problem is whether an analytical continuation to real @xmath4 is possible .",
    "it works at high temperature @xcite , where also other approaches may be successfully employed @xcite , but does not seem to be possible at zero or low temperatures .",
    "imaginary chemical potential can also be used to formulate a quenched limit of qcd in the background of a non - zero number of static quarks @xcite .",
    "cluster algorithms @xcite may provide a way of eliminating the sign problem by summing analytically over configurations in a cluster in such a way that the contribution to the partition function from each cluster is always positive definite .",
    "so far , these methods have been applied to a number of spin models ; however , an application to qcd has yet to be found .",
    "finally , the sign problem may be avoided by simulating theories which resemble qcd , but have a real action even at non - zero chemical potential .",
    "one such theory is qcd at non - zero isospin density @xcite , which is of intrinsic interest because it corresponds to part of the phase diagram for asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "another class of theories encompasses two - colour qcd with fermions in the fundamental representation , as well as qcd with adjoint fermions , for any number of colours .",
    "the remainder of this review will focus on what can be learnt from lattice simulations of these theories .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath4 is introduced on the lattice by multiplying the forward timelike links by @xmath5 and the backward timelike links by @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the determinant @xmath7 of the fermion matrix @xmath8 in two - colour qcd is real , even for non - zero @xmath4 , both in the continuum and on the lattice .",
    "however , it is only possible to demonstrate that it is positive @xcite in the cases of continuum or wilson adjoint fermions and staggered fundamental fermions .",
    "indeed , we will see in section [ sec : adjoint ] that in the case of staggered adjoint fermions there are configurations with a negative determinant , leading to a sign problem at large @xmath4 .      in the chiral limit",
    ", the action for two - colour qcd with @xmath9 flavours has a @xmath10 symmetry , which for staggered fermions is manifest as independent @xmath11 symmetries for the even and odd sites . at @xmath12",
    "this enlarges to a @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "this can be seen most easily by introducing new fields , @xmath14 for ( staggered ) fundamental quarks , and @xmath15 for adjoint quarks .",
    "the action can then be written as @xmath16 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 denotes the even sites . in the continuum ,",
    "the equivalent fields are @xmath18 which gives the continuum lagrangian @xmath19 the explicity chiral symmetry breaking term in the wilson fermion action means that there is no equivalent enlarged symmetry for wilson fermions ; however , new fields may be introduced analogously to the continuum case , and the enlarged symmetries will be broken by @xmath20 terms in the action .",
    "the chiral condensate can be written in terms of the new fields , @xmath21 for staggered fermions , and @xmath22 in the continuum and for wilson fermions . in both cases ,",
    "the @xmath23 sign is for fundamental fermions and the @xmath24 sign for adjoint , while @xmath25 is @xmath26 for fundamental fermions and 1 for adjoint .",
    "a nonzero chiral condensate thereby breaks down the @xmath13 symmetry to o(@xmath27 ) for fundamental fermions and sp(@xmath27 ) for adjoint fermions , giving rise to @xmath28 and @xmath29 goldstone modes respectively . of these , there will be @xmath30 mesonic states , while the remaining @xmath31 will be diquarks . in the continuum , and for wilson fermions , the pattern will be the opposite ( modulo the 1 mode destroyed by the axial anomaly in the continuum ) , but for 1 flavour of fundamental quarks , there is no chiral symmetry in the first place . from this",
    "we see that in the case of @xmath32 adjoint staggered fermions , and only in this case , are there no diquark goldstone modes .    for @xmath33 ,",
    "all the pseudo - goldstone modes remain degenerate , with masses @xmath34 . as the chemical potential @xmath4 increases",
    ", the ground state will begin to be populated with baryonic matter .",
    "the transition to a ground state containing matter occurs when @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the mass of the lightest baryon , and this baryon contains @xmath37 quarks . at this point ,",
    "the baryon number density @xmath38 becomes non - zero , where @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 for wilson fermions , and @xmath40\\big{\\rangle}.   \\label{eq : n}\\ ] ] for staggered fermions .",
    "where there are diquark goldstone modes , those states will be the lightest baryons in the spectrum .",
    "this means that for most variants of two - colour qcd we expect @xmath41 , in contrast to the much larger value @xmath42 expected in real ( three - colour ) qcd .",
    "the exception is two - colour qcd with one flavour of adjoint staggered quarks .    in the limit of small @xmath43 and @xmath4 , the behaviour of @xmath44 , the diquark condensate @xmath45 , and @xmath38 as functions of @xmath43 and @xmath4 can be calculated in chiral perturbation theory . if we define the rescaled variables @xmath46 where the 0",
    "subscript denotes values at @xmath12 , the prediction from @xmath47pt for the models with diquark goldstone modes is @xcite @xmath48      at large chemical potential , the relevant degrees of freedom will be quarks with momenta near the fermi surface .",
    "the attractive quark",
    " quark interaction will give rise to instability with respect to condensation of diquark pairs at opposite sides of the fermi surface .",
    "in physical qcd , the diquark condensate can not be a colour singlet , so the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken , giving rise to the phenomenon of colour superconductivity .    in two - colour qcd ,",
    "on the other hand , there may be the possibility of gauge singlet diquarks , which will be energetically favoured compared to non - singlet states .",
    "indeed , in the previous section we saw that most variants of two - colour qcd have diquark goldstone modes , which will be the preferred channel for diquark condensation . in the @xmath32 staggered adjoint model , this is not the case , and we do not know _ a priori _ in which channel the condensation will occur .",
    "we must proceed by constructing possible operators which obey the pauli principle and making additional assumptions about locality , lorentz structure and gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "at least one of the possible condensates constructed this way gives rise to a colour superconding ground state .",
    "the standard way of computing the diquark condensate on the lattice is to introduce a diquark source term into the action @xcite . for two - colour qcd with fundamental staggered quarks",
    "the action then becomes @xmath49 \\\\   & = & ( \\bar\\chi,\\chi^t )   \\left(\\begin{array}{cc } j\\tau_2 & { \\frac{1}{2}}m \\\\    { \\frac{1}{2}}m & j\\tau_2 \\end{array}\\right )   \\left(\\begin{array}{c } \\!\\bar\\chi^t\\\\",
    "\\!\\!\\chi\\end{array}\\right ) \\equiv x^t{\\mathcal{a}}[j]x \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : action - diquark}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case , the partition function becomes proportional to the pfaffian @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "the diquark condensate @xmath51 may be evaluated by taking @xmath52 an alternative approach @xcite is to rewrite the pfaffian as @xmath53 = \\mathrm{pf}(b+j ) = \\pm\\sqrt{\\det(b+j ) } \\label{eq : pfaff - expand}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 this can be expanded as a polynomial in @xmath55 by diagonalising @xmath56 , obviating the need to simulate at non - zero diquark source . since this gives the pfaffian at any @xmath55 , it can also be used to determine the diquark condensate using the probability distribution function @xcite .",
    "in the past year and a half , a number of groups have been performing lattice simulations of two - colour qcd with fundamental staggered fermions both at zero @xcite and non - zero @xcite temperature . also , one group is performing simulations with wilson fermions @xcite .",
    "aloisio _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have performed simulations in the strong coupling limit for a number of quark masses , flavours and lattice volumes .",
    "[ fig : aloisio - eos ] shows results for the chiral condensate , the diquark condensate and the baryon number density , at @xmath57 and a non - zero source @xmath58 , for two different lattice sizes .",
    "also shown are the @xmath47pt predictions from ( [ eq : chipt ] ) .",
    "the agreement between the prediction and the numerical results is quite striking , considering that this is far from the continuum limit .",
    "this suggests a weak @xmath59 dependence .",
    "[ fig : aloisio - diq ] shows the diquark condensate at zero diquark source , for @xmath60 and a range of quark masses .",
    "again , we see a very good agreement with the prediction ( [ eq : chipt ] ) . at larger @xmath4",
    ", we see that the value of @xmath45 drops , going to zero at high @xmath4 .",
    "this second transition is due to lattice artefacts connected with the saturation of lattice sites with fermions . in the infinite volume limit it is expected to disappear .",
    "simulations at non - zero @xmath4 with a diquark source have been performed by kogut and sinclair @xcite .",
    "results for the diquark condensate and chiral condensate are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sinclair - cond ] .",
    "again , we see the chiral condensate dropping and the diquark condensate rising for @xmath61 , in agreement with @xmath47pt .",
    "we also see the same large-@xmath4 saturation behaviour for the diquark condensate as in @xcite .",
    "[ fig : sinclair - mass ] shows results for pion and scalar diquark masses .",
    "the scalar diquark mass falls roughly as @xmath62 as @xmath4 approaches @xmath63 .",
    "the pion mass remains constant up to @xmath64 , after which it falls to zero .",
    "this is again in accordance with the expectation from @xmath47pt .",
    "the spectrum of the dirac operator has been studied in some detail by the vienna group @xcite for staggered fermions and by the hiroshima group @xcite for wilson fermions . a preliminary study of topology at non - zero temperature",
    "has also been performed @xcite .",
    "as indicated in section [ sec : symmbreaking ] , two - colour qcd with one flavour of adjoint staggered fermions has features which makes it in some senses more ` qcd - like ' than other variants of two - colour qcd . in particular , it has no diquark goldstone modes , so we expect an onset transition at a value of the chemical potential different from @xmath63  possibly at @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the mass of the lightest three - quark baryon ( the ` nucleon ' ) .",
    "it also has a sign problem .",
    "the theory has been simulated @xcite using two different algorithms : hybrid monte carlo , which is not able to change the sign of the determinant , and therefore only simulates the positive determinant sector of the theory , and the two - step multibosonic algorithm @xcite , which is able to take the sign properly into account .",
    "figs  [ fig : unipbp ] and [ fig : uniden ] show the results from hmc simulations for @xmath67 and @xmath68 of ( [ eq : rescale ] ) respectively , for a range of values for the quark mass @xmath43 and chemical potential @xmath4 .",
    "up to @xmath69 , the data collapse onto a universal curve , which agrees well with the predictions of ( [ eq : chipt ] ) . even at larger @xmath70 , the data for the chiral condensate lie close to the @xmath47pt prediction . at @xmath71 , however , the data for different @xmath43 diverge , indicating that @xmath47pt may be breaking down . results for the plaquette @xcite show a drop in its value for @xmath72 , presumably due to pauli blocking , while the pion mass appears to agree with the @xmath47pt prediction @xmath73 at @xmath74 .",
    "the agreement between the predictions of @xmath47pt and these results paradoxically enough presents a problem , since this model is not supposed to contain any diquark goldstone modes , and thus the @xmath47pt predictions of ( [ eq : chipt ] ) are not valid in this case .",
    "in particular , there should not be any onset transition at @xmath75 .",
    "the suspicion must be that this contradiction is due to the fact that hmc does not change the sign of the determinant , and that it therefore simulates the wrong theory  a theory with conjugate quarks .",
    "the simulation points for the tsmb algorithm were selected to focus on the effect of the sign , with one point at @xmath12 , one just past the hmc onset transition , and one deeper into the dense region . with this algorithm , a reweighting factor @xmath76 and the sign of @xmath7 must be determined for each configuration @xcite . the expectation value of an observable @xmath77",
    "is then determined by the ratio @xmath78 the results for @xmath44 and @xmath38 , together with the corresponding hmc results , are summarised in table [ tab : tsmb ] .",
    "for tsmb at @xmath79 we also include observables determined separately in each sign sector , defined by @xmath80 . at @xmath81 the two algorithms agree , as they should .",
    "also , the results in the positive determinant sector for tsmb at larger @xmath4 agree with the hmc results . however , the results for the negative determinant sector are significantly different .",
    "this difference has the effect of bringing the average both for @xmath44 and for @xmath38 back to values consistent with the @xmath12 values .",
    "this is an indication that at @xmath82 and quite possibly also at @xmath83 , the system is still in the vacuum phase , which means that the onset transition in this model occurs at a larger @xmath4 than for other variants of two - colour qcd .",
    "this is consistent with the symmetry - based arguments of section [ sec : symmbreaking ] that this model has no baryonic goldstone modes .",
    "substantial progress has been made recently in lattice simulations of two - colour qcd at non - zero density , with both fundamental and adjoint quarks .",
    "the simulations with fundamental quarks nicely reproduce the predictions from chiral perturbation theory for the chiral condensate , diquark condensate , and baryon density , except at very large chemical potentials . here ,",
    "saturation effects are observed , especially for the diquark condensate .",
    "the meson and diquark spectrum is also being analysed , with preliminary results for the pion and scalar diquark masses again in rough agreement with chiral perturbation theory .",
    "two - colour qcd with one flavour of adjoint staggered quark is not expected to have any diquark goldstone modes , unlike all other variants of two - colour qcd .",
    "it also has a sign problem .",
    "simulations of this model restricted to the sector with a positive fermion determinant reproduce the predictions of chiral perturbation theory for theories with diquark goldstone modes , including an early onset transition at @xmath64  although the breakdown of @xmath47pt may be observed at larger @xmath4 .",
    "when configurations with negative determinants are included , we find a strong correlation between the sign and the value of observables .",
    "this effect appears to lead to a cancellation of the early onset transition .",
    "this observation may hold the key to understanding the problem of the premature onset which has bedevilled previous attempts to simulate physical qcd at non - zero density .",
    "the presence of diquark modes which are degenerate with the pion means that the study two - colour qcd is of limited usefulness when it comes to studying directly the onset transition , hadron spectrum and diquark condensation in physical qcd at non - zero density .",
    "however , useful experience may be gained by comparing the results of lattice simulations with those of other methods which are also applicable to physical qcd . of particular interest would be the study of gluodynamics , where su(2 ) and su(3 ) are expected to exhibit similar behaviour , even at non - zero @xmath4 .",
    "thus it might be possible to cast light on the deconfinement transition at high @xmath4 and low @xmath25 by studying two - colour qcd .",
