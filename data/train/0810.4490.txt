    "noble liquids such as argon or xenon are today two of the best options for large - size dark matter ( dm ) experiment such as wimps ( weak interacting massive particles ) searches because they serve as target and detecting media at the same time .",
    "wimps in fact , with particular regard to the lightest neutralino , are the most popular dm candidates within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "most of the dm models predicts that wimps interact almost only gravitationally and maybe weakly with matter thus forming cold relic halos around massive astronomical objects . for this reason dm is very difficult to detect",
    "directly nevertheless its evidence has been observed using astronomical observation @xcite .",
    "many groups in the world are focusing their attention on the direct detection .",
    "the detectors should have big target masses and excellent noise rejection capabilities because of the small cross section between dm and ordinary matter .",
    "liquid noble gases ( ar , xe , kr , ne ) have a relatively low ionization energy and a good cross section for nuclear recoil processes , moreover they can act as active target because they not only have good scintillation properties but also a long electron lifetime . argon , because of its availability and low cost , is the best one among those candidates and is very competitive for large detectors .",
    "the expected dm signal from a wimp - argon head on collision is a single 10 - 100kev recoiling nucleus .",
    "the passage of ionizing particles in argon produces not only ionization but excitation of atoms as well .",
    "ionized and excited atoms form the excited molecular states ar@xmath0 and",
    "ar@xmath1 respectively . ar@xmath0 eventually recombines with an electron , producing ar@xmath1 in the molecular excited state which decays radiatively ( see fig.[argonscintillation ] ) .",
    "the lowest allowed radiative decays from the molecular excited states are the transitions from the singlet and the triplet states ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) to the dissociative ground state ( @xmath4 ) which consist of two independent atoms ; the emission spectrum for those transitions has a narrow peak at @xmath5 nm in the vacuum ultra violet ( vuv ) band @xcite .",
    "reabsorption can not occur because the energy of the single atomic excited state is too high .",
    "only impurities such as water , n@xmath6 and co@xmath6 can eventually reabsorb vuv light and capture the electrons .",
    "scintillation and ionization in argon.,height=151 ]    those two transition have two different decay times , respectively @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which do not depend on the type or on the energy of the incident particle ; @xmath9@xmath10 is strongly allowed and has a short decay time while @xmath11@xmath10 is allowed only because of spin - orbit coupling and has a much longer life . in liquid argon ( lar )",
    "@xmath12  ns and @xmath13  @xmath14s .    the ratio between the populations of the two states @xmath15 depends strongly on the ionization density of the track ( see fig.[argontopologya ] ) ; for light projectiles such as electrons and @xmath16s @xmath17 while for @xmath18s and fission fragments is @xmath19 . the electron lifetime and the decay time of triplet state",

    "the conceptual layout of the ardm experiment @xcite is illustrated in fig.[ardm ] .",
    "an ionizing particle traveling through an active mass of @xmath20  kg generate scintillation and ion pairs ; a 500 kv cockcroft walton generator chain provides the electric field necessary to drift the electrons towards the gas phase on the top of the detector .",
    "the electrons are then extracted from the liquid to the gas phase ( @xmath213 kv / cm ) and accelerated towards the double stage large electron multiplier ( lem ) detectors which provides multiplication ( gain @xmath22 ) and position reconstruction .",
    "conceptual layout of the ardm experiment.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    detection of light is performed by an array of 14 cryogenic photomultipliers ( pmts ) located below the cathode .",
    "most of the vuv scintillation light hits the side of the detector , therefore we decided to install wavelength shifter ( wls ) coated diffusive reflectors which shift the light from 128 nm to 420 nm ( @xmath23 for bialkali photocathode ) and diffuse the blue light in the detector .",
    "a wls coating of the pmt surface is also foreseen to detect the direct light which is @xmath2410% of the total light .",
    "we plan to achieve an average light collection efficiency of 2% .",
    "with a combined light / charge analysis we should reach an energy threshold of approximately .    in order to reach this goal",
    "it is necessary to have a very high lar purity and an excellent background rejection level .",
    "a good purity is obtained by recirculating the lar through an active copper filter ( purification circuit ) with a specially developed cryogenic pump .",
    "argon quality is monitored using two independent purity monitoring systems , which measure the electron drift length and the decay time of slow component ( @xmath8 ) . the main vessel and the purification circuit",
    "are surrounded by an insulation vacuum ; a lar circuit embedded in the walls of the inner vessel allows to pre - cool the detector .",
    "common background sources for this type of detectors are neutrons , electrons and @xmath16s .",
    "u and th chains contaminating the detector components produce neutron and @xmath16 background , p isotopes ( present in steel ) have @xmath25 activities .",
    "muons induce neutrons and , if interacting with argon , produce the unstable long living @xmath26ar isotope .",
    "lar obtained from the liquefaction of air contains this isotope in a non negligible fraction ; the warp collaboration has reported an activity of @xcite which then makes @xmath26ar one of the most problematic source of background for ardm .",
    "the rejection of this background is a complicated issue and involves more detailed studies which were the subject of simulations .    since we measure the charge with its position , time distribution and the scintillation light with its time structure down to _",
    "scale we are able to distinguish between electrons , @xmath16s and recoiling nuclei .",
    "an example of rejection studies can be seen in fig.[argontopologyb ] : it is possible to identify electron and @xmath16 events by looking at the `` charge / light ratio '' as a function of the total reconstructed energy ( fig.[argontopologyb]a ) or if we want to use only the light information ( for instance to reduce the trigger rate ) we can measure the fraction of light coming from the fast component as a function of the total light ( fig.[argontopologyb]b ) .",
    "this kind of analysis is fundamental to reject @xmath25 radioactivity from @xmath26ar .",
    "event topologies.,height=113 ]    wimps and neutrons lead to similar event topologies since they produce a recoiling argon nucleus ; however the energy spectra and the scattering multiplicities are different .",
    "we can partly reject neutrons because more than 50% of them scatter more than once ; moreover only 10% of them produce a single recoil event in the energy range between and .",
    "we estimate with a montecarlo the total number of neutrons per year coming from the detector components ; from simulation we expect @xmath241000 neutrons / year which will generate a wimp - like recoil rate of @xmath2450 fake wimps / year .",
    "the lem is a scaled - up version of the gaseous electron multiplier ( gem ) ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite).we are developing a double stage lem system composed of two lem planes and a segmented anode plane ; each lem plane consists of a dual layer thick printed circuit board ( pcb ) with diameter holes with a pitch of , made by precise machining ( standard pcb technology ) .",
    "holes in the last plane are grouped by strips similarly to the anode plane in order to provide a 2d segmented readout of ions and electrons .",
    "the third dimension along the cylinder is obtained by time projection imaging .",
    "a granularity of few millimeter will grant a sufficient vertex resolution for rejection of multiple scattered neutrons .",
    "we have already achieved operation of a dual stage lem system in dual phase argon , extracting electron from the liquid to gaseous phase with a small prototype in a dedicated setup ( fig.[lemp ] ) .",

    "the internal surface of the active volume is covered by wls reflector panels .",
    "we selected tetraphenyl butadiene ( tpb ) as the best wls for vuv to blue light conversion because of its light conversion efficiency and its diffusive reflection properties .",
