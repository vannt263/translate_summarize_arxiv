    "the problem of domain walls has a long history both in its general field aspect @xcite and in a possible relevance to cosmology @xcite .",
    "recently the interest to properties of domain walls has been given a new boost in supersymmetric models , which naturally possess several degenerate vacua , thus allowing for a multitude @xcite of domain wall type configurations interpolating between those vacua .",
    "furthermore it has been realised @xcite that at least some of these walls have rather distinct properties under supersymmetry and in fact their field profiles satisfy first order differential equations in analogy with the bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfeld ( bps ) equations @xcite .",
    "for this reason such configurations are called  bps - saturated walls \" , or  bps walls \" .",
    "it was also noticed @xcite that , quite typically , there may exist a continuous set of the bps walls , all degenerate in energy , interpolating between the same pair of vacua .",
    "a further analysis @xcite of such set in a specific model revealed that the solutions in the set can be interpreted as two elementary bps walls parallel to each other at a finite separation , the distance between the walls being the continuous parameter labeling the solutions .",
    "since all the configurations in the set have the same energy , equal to the sum of the energies of the elementary walls , one encounters here a remarkable situation where there is no ` potential ' interaction between the elementary walls .",
    "( this property is protected by supersymmetry and holds in all orders of perturbation theory . )",
    "the existence of multiple vacua in supersymmetric models naturally invites a consideration of more complicated field configurations , than just two vacua separated by a domain wall , namely those with co - existing multiple domains of different degenerate vacua @xcite .",
    "this leads to the problem of intersecting domain walls .",
    "it should be noted , that by far not every conceivable configuration of domains is stable , e.g. any intersection of domain walls in a one - field theory is unstable , and the conditions for stability of the intersections of the walls in multiple - field theories@xcite generally allow only a well defined set of intersection angles , depending on relation between the energy densities of the intersecting walls . as is discussed further in this paper , for the elementary bps walls , considered in @xcite , i.e. non - interacting in the parallel configuration ( zero intersection angle @xmath0 )",
    ", at least a finite range of values for @xmath0 , including @xmath1 , is allowed by the stability conditions for a quadruple intersection , shown in fig.[fig : cross1 ] .",
    "when viewed as an intersection of world surfaces of the walls in the space - time , rather than as a static spatial configuration , the intersection describes scattering of moving walls , and in the case of a collision of spatially parallel walls ( or kinks in a ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional model ) the angle @xmath0 translates into @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the relative velocity of the walls , for small @xmath0 , i.e. for non - relativistic collisions .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is a more detailed study of the field profile for the intersection configuration of such type .",
    "we consider here the same supersymmetric model as in ref.@xcite and use the explicit solution for parallel walls , found there , to construct an approximation to the classical field profile for intersecting walls , which is valid to the first order in @xmath0 for small @xmath0 .",
    "this approximation gives the energy of the static field configuration up to @xmath4 inclusive , while for the case of collision of the walls the corresponding result is obviously the action for the collision  trajectory \" .",
    "[ fig : cross1 ]    our main findings are as follows .",
    "there exists a well defined gap @xmath5 between the vertices of pairwise ` meet ' of the walls , so that a more detailed picture of the intersection looks as shown in actual detail in fig.[fig : cross3 ] further in the paper . in the collision",
    "kinematics this gap is in time and corresponds to a finite time delay in the scattering process .",
    "this classical quantity clearly can also be translated into a phase shift in a quantum mechanical description of the scattering .",
    "the gap depends on the intersection angle , and is given by x= 1 _ 0 m  , [ gap ] where @xmath6 is a mass parameter for the masses of quanta in the model , and @xmath7 is a dimensionless constant , depending on the ratio of the coupling constants in the model .",
    "we also find that there is a finite angle - dependent energy ( in the static configuration ) associated with the intersection : = _ 0 m  , [ ener ] where @xmath8 is the energy density of each of the elementary walls .",
    "naturally , in a ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional theory @xmath9 is in fact the energy per unit length of the intersection , while in a ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional case it is an energy localized at the intersection . in a ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional model only the collision kinematics ( for two elementary kinks ) is possible , thus @xmath9 has the meaning of a finite action ( phase shift ) associated with the collision .",
    "we believe that the equations ( [ gap ] ) and ( [ ener ] ) are quite general at small @xmath0 , and the only model dependence is encoded in the dimensionless quantity @xmath7 .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the supersymmetric model under consideration and describe the solutions for the bps walls . in section 3",
    "we consider intersecting domain walls within an _ ansatz _ allowing us to construct the field profiles in the limit of small intersection angle , and we find the characteristics of the intersection . in section 4",
    "we discuss applicability of the findings of this paper when some of the restrictions , assumed here , are relaxed .",
    "the specific susy model under consideration is that of two chiral superfields @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the superpotential w ( , x)= m^2 - 1 3 ^3 - x^2 . [ spot ] here @xmath6 is a mass parameter and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are coupling constants .",
    "the phases of the fields and of the @xmath14 are assumed to be adjusted in such a way that all the parameters are real and positive , and the lowest components of the superfields @xmath10 and @xmath11 are denoted correspondingly as @xmath15 and @xmath16 throughout this paper .",
    "the model has the @xmath17 symmetry under independent flip of the sign of either of the fields : @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the vacuum states in this model are found as stationary points of the superpotential function ( [ spot ] ) : @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and are located at @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( labeled here as the vacua 1 and 2 ) , and at @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( the vacua 3 and 4 ) .",
    "the locations and the labeling of the vacuum states are shown in fig.[fig : cross2 ] . throughout this paper",
    "the fermionic superpartners of the bosons are irrelevant and also only real components of the fields appear in the considered configurations .",
    "therefore for what follows it is appropriate to write the expression for the part of the lagrangian describing the real parts of the scalar fields : l= ( ) ^2 + ( ) ^2 - ( m^2 - ^2 - ^2 ) ^2 - 4 ^2 ^2 ^2  .",
    "[ lagr ]    [ fig : cross2 ]    as discussed in detail in ref.@xcite , in this model exists a continuous set of bps walls interpolating between the vacua 1 and 2 , all having the energy density @xmath26 .",
    "these configurations with positive ( negative ) @xmath16 can be interpreted as parallel elementary bps walls , i.e. connecting the vacua 1 and 3 ( 1 and 4 ) and the vacua 3 and 2 ( 4 and 2 ) located at a finite distance from each other .",
    "the energy @xmath8 of each of the elementary walls is @xmath27 .",
    "the only non - bps domain wall in this model is the one connecting the vacua 3 and 4 , and its energy is given by @xmath28 .",
    "the first - order equations for the bps walls are conveniently written in terms of dimensionless field variables @xmath29 and @xmath30 , defined as @xmath31 for a domain wall perpendicular to the @xmath32 axis the bps equations read as@xcite @xmath33 here the notation is used @xmath34 and the mass parameter @xmath6 is set to one .",
    "although the equations ( [ bps ] ) are solved@xcite in quadratures for arbitrary @xmath35 , it is only for @xmath36 that the non - trivial solution can be written in terms of elementary functions .",
    "it is this explicitly solvable case of @xmath36 that we consider for the most part in this paper for the sake of presenting closed expressions wherever possible .",
    "the set of solutions to the equations ( [ bps ] ) in this case reads as@xcite f(z)=a ( e^2z-1 ) a+2 e^z + a e^2z  ,  h^2 ( z)= 2 e^z a+2 e^z + a e^2z  , [ sol ] where @xmath37 is a continuous parameter , @xmath38 labeling the solutions in the set , and the overall translational freedom is fixed here by centering the configuration at @xmath39 in the sense that @xmath40 .",
    "the interpretation of these configurations becomes transparent , if one introduces the notation : s = a^-1  .",
    "[ sa ] then the expressions ( [ sol ] ) can be written as f(z)=1 2 ( + )  ,   h^2(z)=1 2 ( 1- )  .",
    "[ solm ] in this form it is clear that at large @xmath41 ( i.e. at small @xmath37 ) the functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 differ from their values in one of the vacua only near @xmath42 , i.e. the configuration splits into the elementary walls , corresponding to the transition between the vacua @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) at @xmath45 and the transition between the vacua @xmath46 at @xmath47 .",
    "( for definiteness we refer to the solution with positive @xmath48 . )",
    "remarkably , the function @xmath29 is simply a sum of the profiles for the elementary walls : @xmath49 with f_13(z)=1 2 ( -1 )  ,   f_32(z)=1 2 ( + 1 )  .",
    "[ elemf ] while the function @xmath48 is not a linear superposition of the profiles of @xmath30 for elementary walls : h_13 ^ 2(z)= 1 2 ( 1 + )  ,   h_32 ^ 2(z)= 1 2 ( 1- )  , [ elemh ] but rather for large @xmath41 the profile of @xmath48 is exponentially ( in @xmath41 ) close to a linear superposition of the elementary wall profiles separated by the distance @xmath50 .",
    "thus at large @xmath41 ( small @xmath37 ) the solution ( [ sol ] ) describes two far separated elementary walls .",
    "the caveat of parameterizing the solution in terms of @xmath41 for arbitrary positive @xmath37 is that , according to eq.([sol ] ) , at @xmath51 the parameter @xmath41 bifurcates into the complex plane and becomes purely imaginary , reaching @xmath52 at @xmath53 .",

    "in order to describe a static intersection of two elementary walls at a small angle @xmath0 , we make the natural _ ansatz _ that the parameter @xmath37 in the solution ( [ sol ] ) is a  slow \" function of the coordinate @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we then substitute this _",
    "ansatz _ in the expression for the energy of the fields and find e= x [ enera ] with f^2(a)=1 ( a^2 - 1)^2 ( 1 a^2 - 5 2 + 3 a^2 2 )  .",
    "[ fa ] the interpretation of this expression for the energy becomes quite simple at small @xmath37 , if one writes it in terms of the ( @xmath57 dependent ) parameter @xmath41 ( cf .",
    "eq.([sa ] ) ) , assuming that @xmath60 : e= x  .",
    "[ eners ] at large @xmath41 the weight function for @xmath61 in the latter expression rapidly reaches one , and for the trajectory @xmath62 , corresponding to two walls being at large distance and inclined towards each other at the relative slope we make no distinction between the angle and the slope . when discussing large @xmath0 , or higher order terms , we imply that @xmath0 is the relative slope , so that the full opening angle between the walls is @xmath63 . ]",
    "@xmath0 , the energy per unit length of @xmath57 coincides in order @xmath4 with that of two independent walls : @xmath64 .",
    "in order to find the relation between @xmath37 and @xmath57 at arbitrary separation between the walls within our _ ansatz _ , one needs to solve the variational problem for the energy integral , given by eq.([enera ] ) .",
    "the solution is quite straightforward : introduce a function @xmath65 , such that = -f(a ) d a x [ siga ] ( the minus sign here ensures that @xmath66 is growing when @xmath37 decreases . )",
    "then the solution of the variational problem for @xmath66 is a linear function of @xmath57 : = x/2  .",
    "[ sigx ] the overall shift in @xmath57 and @xmath66 is chosen so that @xmath67 and @xmath68 when @xmath69 i.e. at the center of the intersection .",
    "the slope of the @xmath65 is determined by noticing that at @xmath70 the function @xmath71 behaves as @xmath72 , thus at small @xmath37 the slope of @xmath66 coincides with that of @xmath73 , defined above as @xmath74 at large @xmath41 .    at this point",
    "we address the question about the accuracy of our _ ansatz _ at small @xmath0 , and consider the full second - order differential equations for the fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 following from the lagrangian in eq.([lagr ] ) .",
    "since at fixed @xmath37 the profile given by eqs.([sol ] ) satisfies also the second - order equations in the @xmath32 variable , the mismatch in the full two - dimensional equations is given by the second derivatives in @xmath57 only : @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "one can readily see however that these quantities are of order @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , e.g. for the term with @xmath77 one finds using eqs.([siga ] ) and ( [ sigx ] ) @xmath78 thus our _ ansatz _ correctly approximates the actual solution in the first order in @xmath0 .",
    "once it is established that the correction @xmath79 to the solution within the _ ansatz _ is @xmath80 ( with @xmath81 generically denoting the fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , it is clear that the corrections to the energy can start only in the order @xmath82 .",
    "indeed , the variation of the energy , minimized within the _ ansatz _ , @xmath83 is of order of the mismatch in the field equations , i.e. @xmath80 . thus the error in the found energy @xmath84 is @xmath85 .",
    "a remark concerning further details of the discussed solution is due in relation with the singularity in @xmath37 at @xmath68 .",
    "formally , the described solution is only specified so far at @xmath86 . at negative @xmath57 one",
    "a priori can choose one of two options : symmetrically reflect the profile at positive @xmath57 , or also flip the sign of the field @xmath30 at negative @xmath57 .",
    "the first option would correspond to the domains of the same vacuum ( i.e. the vacuum 3 or the vacuum 4 ) at small @xmath32 on both sides of the intersection , while the second option describes the change from the vacuum 3 to the vacuum 4 at the intersection .",
    "the first configuration however is unstable ( the translational zero mode develops a nodal line ) , and only the second type configuration should be chosen .",
    "one can notice that the profile of the fields within our _ ansatz _ depends in fact on the scaling variable @xmath87 .",
    "this obviously implies that a ` longitudinal ' interval of @xmath88 between some fixed characteristic values of the fields in the configuration scales as @xmath89 .",
    "the behavior of the parameter @xmath37 in the expression ( [ sol ] ) for the field profile as a function of @xmath66 is determined by the equation f(a ) d a = -1  .",
    "[ asig ] this equation can be readily solved numerically , and the resulting picture of the intersection is presented in figures 3 and 4 .    [",
    "fig : cross3 ]    [ fig : cross4 ]    it is seen from the figures that the four crests of the energy density profile do not intersect at one point , rather there is a finite gap between the pairwise intersections of the energy crests for the ` initial ' and the ` final ' walls . in order to quantify this gap",
    ", we find from eqs.([asig ] ) and ( [ sa ] ) the relation between @xmath66 and @xmath41 as = ^_1 / s f(a ) da [ sigmas ] and then find numerically that at large @xmath41 this relation gives @xmath90 with @xmath91 . since at large @xmath41 the distance between the elementary walls is naturally identified as @xmath50 , one concludes that when the intersection of two walls is extrapolated from large distances it comes short of the actual center of the solution by the distance @xmath92 .",
    "the gap @xmath7 between the apparent pairwise collision vertices is then twice this distance . in this way",
    "we obtain the equation ( [ gap ] ) with @xmath93 in the particular model with @xmath36 .    in order to find the proper expression for the energy associated with the intersection",
    ", one can consider the problem of intersecting walls as a boundary value problem in a large box with the size @xmath94 in the @xmath57 direction ( so that the boundaries are at @xmath95 ) , and at the boundaries the positions of the walls in the @xmath32 direction are specified as @xmath96 , where @xmath41 is the parameter in the expression ( [ solm ] ) for the profile .",
    "( clearly the sign of @xmath48 at @xmath97 should be chosen opposite to that at @xmath98 in order to have an intersection configuration . )",
    "we also assume that the separation @xmath99 between the walls at the boundaries satisfies @xmath100 in order to correspond to @xmath101 . for free walls , with no energy associated with the intersection",
    ", the energy of such configuration would be determined by the total length of the walls in the box : e_0=2 2 l + l ( l l ) ^2  .",
    "[ ener0 ] for the solution within our _ ansatz _ , however , the energy is given by e=2 l + l ^2 4  , [ ener1 ] where @xmath102 is the slope in the solution @xmath103 . at @xmath104 one can use the asymptotic relation @xmath105 , and find from the boundary condition for @xmath41 the relation for @xmath0 : @xmath106 upon substituting this relation in eq.([ener1 ] ) one finds a finite difference between the expressions ( [ ener1 ] ) and ( [ ener0 ] ) for the energy : @xmath107 , given by our result in eq.([ener ] ) .",
    "if instead of the spatial coordinate @xmath57 one uses the time coordinate @xmath108 , the discussed configuration describes a collision of two parallel walls ( or two kinks in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional theory ) . in this case",
    "the parameter of the intersection @xmath0 is identified as the relative velocity @xmath3 of the walls , and eq.([gap ] ) describes the time delay in the process of scattering of the walls , while the quantity @xmath9 in eq.([ener ] ) gives the additional action with respect to the free motion of the walls , and thus is equal to the phase of the transmission amplitude in a quantum mechanical description of the scattering .",
    "the description of intersection of elementary domain walls is found here for small intersection angles and for a particular value of the parameter @xmath35 , @xmath36 , in a specific susy model . at present",
    "we can only speculate how our results are modified beyond these restrictions .",
    "although the same _ ansatz _ , as used here , can be applied in the limit of small @xmath0 at any value of @xmath35 , one inevitably has to resort to numerical analysis because of lack of an explicit simple expressions for the profiles of the fields , except for the trivial case @xmath109 . in particular , the existence of the gap at the intersection appears to be related to the existence of the special bifurcation solution@xcite for parallel walls .",
    "indeed a non - zero difference @xmath110 between @xmath66 and @xmath41 , arising from the integral in eq.([sigmas ] ) , comes mostly from the integration over the values of @xmath37 past the bifurcation point , i.e. from @xmath51 to @xmath111 .",
    "the bifurcation solution on the other hand exists in the considered model only for @xmath112 , and at @xmath113 the solution corresponds to @xmath114 , so that the bifurcation point is located at @xmath68 for such @xmath35 .",
    "our preliminary numerical study of the dependence of the size of the gap on @xmath35 indicates that indeed the gap appears to arise starting with @xmath113 and becomes larger with increasing @xmath35 , whereas at @xmath115 we have found no apparent gap .",
    "this conjecture about such behavior is somewhat supported by the fact that at @xmath109 the elementary walls are not interacting and simply  go through \" at the intersection with no gap whatsoever .    as to the dependence on the intersection parameter @xmath0 , our _ ansatz _ becomes inapplicable when @xmath0 is not small , and the behavior of the corresponding configurations is not known . here",
    "we can only mention that the stability conditions@xcite for the wall intersections allow a static quadruple intersection with any @xmath0 if @xmath116 . indeed in this case",
    "the energy of the non - bps wall ( @xmath117 ) , @xmath118 is larger than the sum of the energies of the elementary walls , and thus the quadruple intersection can not split into triple ones , since the stability conditions for triple intersections can not be satisfied . on the contrary , at @xmath119 such splitting is possible with the critical value of @xmath0 defined as @xmath120 .",
    "bps solitons are known to present effective low - energy degrees of freedom in some supersymmetric field theories .",
    "these effective ( `` dual '' ) theories exploit the fact that elementary solitons do not interact with each other at zero energies , both classically and quantum mechanically .",
    "this is just the case in the model considered , where the energy of parallel elementary domain walls does not depend on distance between them , and this degeneracy is not lifted by quantum corrections .",
    "we demonstrated here by an explicit calculation that some highly nontrivial interaction between bps domain walls arises at nonzero momenta .",
    "if this observation holds for general case , to obtain dynamical information from dual models of that class appears to be an extremely complicated task .",
