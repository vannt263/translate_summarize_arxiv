    "alloys are among the most relevant materials for modern technologies .",
    "conventional alloys typically consist of one principal element , such as the iron in steel , plus one or more dopant elements in small proportion ( e.g. carbon in the case of steel ) that enhance a certain property of interest ; the properties are based on the modification of those of the principal element . in sharp contrast , high - entropy alloys ( hea ) are comprised of multiple principal elements that are all present in major proportion , with the simple structures observed attributed to the high configurational entropy of the random mixing of the elements on their lattice sites @xcite .",
    "thus , the concept of a `` principal element '' becomes irrelevant .",
    "the elements in heas arrange on simple lattices with the atoms stochastically distributed on the crystallographic positions ; heas are commonly referred to as metallic glasses on an ordered lattice ( see figure [ fig:1](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "the properties of heas arise as a result of the collective interactions of the randomly distributed constituents @xcite .",
    "there is no strict definition , but heas are typically composed of four or more major elements in similar concentrations . by applying this concept , several new alloys with simple body - centered cubic ( bcc ) , hexagonal - closest packing ( hcp ) , or face - centered cubic ( fcc ) structures have been realized @xcite .",
    "the heas compete for thermodynamic stability with crystalline intermetallic phases with smaller numbers of elemental constituents @xcite .",
    "therefore , one central concept of designing these alloys is to understand the interplay between mixing entropy @xmath0 and phase selection . considering the large number of metals in the periodic table ,",
    "the total number of possible hea compositions is virtually unlimited . +   +        . [ fig:1 ]    in addition to their structural and chemical diversity , heas can display novel , highly - tunable properties such as for example excellent specific strength @xcite , superior mechanical performance at high temperatures @xcite , and fracture toughness at cryogenic temperatures @xcite , making them promising candidates for new applications .",
    "simple niobium - titanium based binary alloys are nowadays still the most often and widely used materials for superconducting magnets , such as e.g. in nmr and mri devices @xcite or the large hardron collider @xcite , and thus the discovery of bulk superconductivity with a single well defined phase transition on a highly disordered bcc lattice in the nb - ti",
    "related ta - nb - hf - zr - ti hea is of considerable interest @xcite .",
    "this multicomponent phase , stabilized by the high mixing entropy , appears to fall between an ordered solid and a glass , and thus allows for study of the chemical composition and structure - property relations of a superconducting material part - way between an ordinary alloy and an amorphous material on a fundamental level .",
    "here , we report the results of our investigations of the influence of electron count and alloy complexity on superconductivity in the ta - nb - hf - zr - ti hea .",
    "we find that the variation in superconducting transition temperature with electron count is intermediate to those displayed by simple alloys and amorphous materials , and that the elemental make - up of the hea superconductor is critical for determining its properties , in spite of the fact that the materials system is very highly disordered .",

    "a zirconium sponge was co - heated to purify the reaction atmosphere from remaining oxygen .",
    "the samples were melted five times , and turned over each time to ensure optimal mixing of the constituents , the weight loss during melting was found to be insignificant .",
    "x - ray diffraction patterns were obtained from mechanically flattened pieces ( in liquid nitrogen ) of the very hard alloys , measured in a bragg - bretano reflection geometry .",
    "the patterns were obtained on a bruker d8 advance eco with cu @xmath2 radiation and a lynxeye - xe detector .",
    "the resistivity , magnetization and specific heat were studied using a _ quantum design _ physical property measurement system ( ppms ) dynacool with a 9 t magnet , equipped with a vibrating sample magnetometer option ( vsm ) . for the resistivity measurements ,",
    "a standard 4-probe technique was employed with 20 @xmath3 m diameter platinum wires attached with silver epoxy .",

    "specific - heat measurements were performed with the quantum design heat - capacity option using a relaxation technique .",

    "all prepared alloys fall within the definition for hea compositions ( see , e.g. , reference ) , with no constituent element of less than 5 mol-% and/or more than 40 mol-% . in figure [ fig:1]c",

    "the patterns are found to shift only slightly with composition .",
    "therefore a shifting of the cell parameter @xmath6 is observed , but its change between the different heas is only minor .",
    "all alloys are found to be single phase with broad reflections , which we attribute to both the high degree of disorder present in the heas and also the non - ideal diffraction sample preparation ( the alloys are too hard to crush by our methods , and so fine particle size powders could not be made for the diffraction experiment ) .",
    "the observed unit cell change results from the large difference of atomic radii of the different constituent atoms .",
    "the unit cell parameter for the bcc lattice observed is found to vary from @xmath7   to @xmath8   within the solid solution .",
    "the earlier reported cell parameter for variants of this ta - nb - hf - zr - ti hea follow this trend accordingly @xcite .",

    "the sommerfeld constant is found to decrease substantially from @xmath24 797 mj mol@xmath19 k@xmath25 to 645 mj mol@xmath19 k@xmath25 with a decreasing electron count within the series .",
    "thereby , the density of states at the fermi - level is reduced , since @xmath15 is proportional to the density of states at the fermi - level ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "thus we attribute the decreasing of the critical temperature @xmath9 with an increasing electron count to a significant decrease in the density of states .",
    "it should be noted that simultaneously also the electron - phonon coupling is lowered , which also might contribute to the lowering of the critical temperature ( see below ) . and have nominally the same electron count , and experimentally we find the same density of states at the fermi - level , with almost identical values for @xmath15 .",
    "the debye temperature is found to increase only slightly .",
    "thus although the critical temperatures differ by almost a factor of 2 , there is not much difference in the fundamental quantities that determine the transition temperature : @xmath15 and @xmath27 .",
    "we therefore tentatively attribute the decrease in @xmath9 to the difference in the electron - phonon coupling @xmath28 that must occur on going from to .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling @xmath29 can be estimated using the approximated mcmillan formula , which is based on the phonon spectrum of niobium @xcite and is valid for @xmath30 @xcite : @xmath31 the parameter @xmath32 is the effective coulomb repulsion which arises from coulomb - coupling propagating much more rapidly than phonon - coupling . here",
    ", we are using a value of @xmath32 = 0.13 , which is an average value used commonly for intermetallic superconductors ( see , e.g. , reference ) . having the sommerfeld parameter and the electron - phonon coupling , the noninteracting density of states at the fermi energy can be calculated according to : @xmath33 from the electronic low temperature specific heat data , we have estimated the value of the superconducting gap of all three compounds , according to @xmath34 the obtained values for the electronic and phononic contributions to the superconductivity in heas are summarized in table [ tab:2 ] .",
    "the values for @xmath35(0 ) are similar to comparable intermetallic superconductors and for all three samples the value for 2@xmath35(0)/k@xmath36 is close to the expected value of 3.52 , which is expected for s - wave superconductors according to the bcs model .",
    "the estimated values for the electron - phonon coupling @xmath29 further support that the density of states at the fermi level @xmath37 remains the same for and , while the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath29 is strongly reduced for the latter material .",
    "this finding supports the general concept that specific elements are essential for optimized superconductivity in compounds .",
    "here we find that the elemental make - up is crucial even in the case of a highly disordered multi - compontent hea superconductor .",
    "we have synthesized the hea for _ x _ = 0.2 , 0.25 , 0.3 , 0.33 , 0.35 , 0.4 , 0.45 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , and 0.84 by arcmelting of the elements under argon and by subsequent quenching .",
    "we found from x - ray powder diffraction measurements that all these alloys arrange on a simple bcc crystal lattice ( @xmath38 ) , with unit cell parameters between @xmath39   to @xmath40    within the solid solution .",
    "all prepared samples are found to be bulk superconductors with critical temperatures between @xmath41 4.49 k and 7.92 k. by comparison of the critical temperatures of with the critical temperatures of the transition metals and their alloys in the crystalline form and as amorphous vapor - deposited films , we find the superconducting hea to display characteristics intermediate to both of them .",
    "the valence electron dependence of the transition temperatures for is clearly less pronounced than that seen for crystalline alloys .",
    "however , a maximum is reached right around e / a(d - electron ) = 4.7 , which is an essential feature of the matthias rule for crystalline transition metal superconductors .",
    "therefore , we find that this system neither follows a crystalline nor an amorphous - like trend for this collective electron state .",
    "we find the temperature dependent electrical resistivity @xmath42 of the heas to be metallic and decreasing linearly with decreasing temperature and that the slopes of the upper critical field @xmath13 increase with increasing mixing entropy of the system .",
    "it is , therefore , not the member of this series with the highest critical temperature @xmath9 that has the largest @xmath43(0 ) .",
    "rather , the sample with _ x _",
    "= 0.5 has the largest upper critical field , with a large negative slope of the upper critical field @xmath44 -2.618 t / k and an overall @xmath43(0 ) @xmath45 11.67 t. by reducing the mixing entropy @xmath0 the critical temperatures are found to decrease only slightly from the binary alloy with a critical temperature of @xmath41 9.2 k to the hea .",
    "thus the disorder introduced by the increasing number of constituent atoms does not lead to a loss of the superconductivity or a large decrease of the critical temperature @xmath9 .",
    "we do find however that the effect of elemental make - up is significant for the physical properties even for the highly disordered atoms on the simple lattice in this superconducting hea .",
    "the general interplay of chemical structure , disorder , and superconductivity are topics of fundamental interest .",
    "many known superconductors are posed near structural instabilities , for example , the bismuth oxide superconductors @xcite , the tungsten bronzes @xcite , and also many intermetallic superconductors @xcite .",
    "the superconducting hea studied here offers the unique opportunity to investigate superconductivity on one of the three most fundamental crystal lattices stabilized by high - entropy mixing . for future work , it will be of interest to determine the electronic and phononic densities of states of these alloys in order to understand their interplay .",
