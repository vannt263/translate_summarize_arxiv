    "the principal aim of this work is to study the evolution of morphology in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters , for flat cdm cosmological models , normalized in order to reproduce the observed cluster abundance .",
    "we also compare its trend with observational x  ray data and find a substantial discrepancy on the rate of evolution of substructures , which seem to evolve faster in models than in data .",
    "this result is not surprising , as the slope of cdm spectrum , around the cluster scale , is known to be too flat .",
    "e.g. , the _ extra power _",
    "parameter @xmath5 ( @xmath6 are mass variances on @xmath7mpc scales ; @xmath8 ) is significantly lower in data than in model predictions : for apm galaxies , peacock and dodds ( 1995 ) found @xmath9 ; for the abell / aco sample , borgani ( 1997 ) found @xmath10 in the interval 0.180.25 ; on the contrary cdm models predict @xmath11 .",
    "what is however stricking is the sensitivity that the tests we performed on hydrodynamical simulations , seem to have in appreciating the spectral slope .",
    "high @xmath10 values imply that too many  intervene in the dynamical growth of fluctuations , on cluster scales",
    ". an excess evolution can be therefore expected .",
    "but available data cover only a narrow redshift interval ( @xmath12 ) and simulation outputs shall be used on the same interval , reproducing data distribution .",
    "the point is then that different rates seem already visible on such redshifts , which concern a fairly recent cosmic evolution .",
    "the tests we use start from the a statistical tool introduced by buote & tsai ( 1995 ) , who defined the so  called power ratios , which essentially derive from a multipole expansion of x  ray surface brightness . in sec .",
    "2 more details on definition will be reported .",
    "much work on was already done , both in order to derive them from data and to compare them with simulations ( buote & tsai 1995 , buote & tsai 1996 , tsai & buote 1996 , buote & xu 1997 ) .",
    "in a recent work , buote e xu ( 1997 ) gave some plots where the evolution of cluster morphology in data and cdm simulations are compared ; similar plots are given also by us .    here",
    ", however , we present two essential improvements : ( i ) instead of using pure cdm n  body simulations , we use the outputs of a treesph code , therefore including hydrodynamical effects .",
    "a large number of massive clusters are treated in this way and hydrodynamical effects are found to be important in shaping the distribution of the x  ray emitting baryon component .",
    "this will be shown in some plots where dm and baryon distributions are compared ; but there is also a back effect of the different baryon distributions on the evolution of the potential well , which can not be appreciated directly from the plots .",
    "( ii ) furthermore , to compare data and simulations , we use an advanced statistical discriminator ( peacock 1982 , fasano & franceschini 1987 ) , which allows us to find quantitative estimates of the probability that the same process gives rise to observational and simulated statistical outputs .",
    "the discrepancy we find is however directly visible in suitable evolutionary plots and can be also appreciated using a simpler statistical test .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 power ratios are defined and their evolution is discussed . in sec .",
    "3 we give some details about the model and simulation procedure followed to define clusters and study their evolution .",
    "power ratios are computed in sec .",
    "4 where we also perform the comparison between data and simulations .",
    "results are discussed in sec . 5 , where some general conclusions are also drawn .",
    "appendix a includes a brief outline of the pf2 statistical test , and some discussion of the reasons why its extension to three dimensions is premature .",
    "in this section we shall report results of tsai & buote ( 1996 ) and buote & xu ( 1997 ) , which are the starting point of our arguments .",
    "the steps to work out the power ratios from a model cluster are the following ones : ( i ) we assume that the x  ray emission power is @xmath13 and project it on a random plane @xmath14 , yielding a surface brightness @xmath15 ( apart of a proportionality factor ) .",
    "( ii ) we find the projected mass center ( or _ centroid _ ) @xmath16 for @xmath15 ; in respect to @xmath16 , the surface brightness can be expressed as @xmath17 ; ( iii ) we use such @xmath18 to generate a pseudo ",
    "potential @xmath19 , by solving the poisson equation : @xmath20 ( again , a constant factor , in front of the r.h.s .",
    " @xmath21 , the gravitational constant @xmath22 ,  would turn out to be irrelevant ) .",
    "( iv ) we expand @xmath23 in multipoles ; from the coefficients of such expansion , the power ratios @xmath24 are obtained .",
    "more in detail : @xmath25 where @xmath26 ^ 2\\ ] ] and @xmath27 \\cos(m\\varphi ) } } \\ ] ] @xmath28 \\sin(m\\varphi)}}\\ ] ] henceforth , the constants which were unspecified cancel out , when the ratio of @xmath29 s is considered .",
    "moreover , owing to the definition of the centroid @xmath16 , @xmath30 vanishes and @xmath31 should then be disregarded . as we restricted the analysis to @xmath32 , which account for on scales not much smaller than @xmath33 itself",
    ", there are only 3 significant ( @xmath34 )",
    ".    therefore , during its evolution , a cluster moves along a line ( _ evolutionary track _ ) in the 3dimensional space spanned by such s , whose 2dimensional projections will be considered below . starting from a configuration away from the origin , corresponding to a large amount of internal structure",
    ", a cluster evolves towards isotropization and homogeneization .",
    "this motion , however , does not occur with a steady trend , as sudden bursts of structure appear when further matter lumps approach the cluster potential well , to be absorbed by it .",
    "however , the evolutionary track eventually approaches the origin , and this can be more easily appreciated by averaging over the contributions of several clusters .",
    "actual data , of course , do not show the motion of a single cluster along the evolutionary track .",
    "different clusters , however , lie at different redshifts and , in average , can be expected to describe a succession of evolutionary moments .",
    "power ratios for model clusters are to be set in the 3dimensional space spanned by s , taking each model cluster at redshifts distributed as for data clusters .",
    "the data set is the same of buote @xmath35 tsai ( 1996 ) . among x ",
    "ray cluster images , taken with @xmath36 pspc ( pfeffermann 1987 ) , and such that the pspc central ring contains a cluster portion whose radius exceeds 400@xmath37kpc , they took those contained in the heasarc  legacy database and belonging to the ebeling ( 1993 ) or edge ( 1990 ) samples . out of the 59 objects selected in this way , they could estimate for 44 of them at @xmath38mpc and for 27 of them at @xmath39mpc .",
    "pspc data give the x  ray surface brightness @xmath40 , which is to be used in the same way as the @xmath18 s obtained from models , to work out for @xmath41mpc .    in fig .",
    "1 we give the redshift distribution of data clusters , for the three values of @xmath33 . as we shall discuss further in the next section , we have 40 simulated clusters to deal with .    we take each of them , only at a single @xmath42 value , producing 50 @xmath42 distributions similar to real data . in order to work out power ratios , we need to treat each cluster with reference to a given plane : 50 random planes are selected for each cluster and one of them is considered for each @xmath42 sequence .",
    "the main contribution of this work is given by the simulations we run , to work out , and that will be however used for several other aims .",
    "we started from a box with a side @xmath43mpc , where we evolved a cdm model with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the initial spectrum was normalized in order that the cumulative cluster number density @xmath46 , for @xmath47 , yields @xmath48 , according to data on cluster abundance ( white 1993 , biviano 1993 , eke 1996 ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath49 .",
    "the simulation was run from @xmath50 to @xmath51 using a p3 m code with 10@xmath52 particles ( mass @xmath53 ) .",
    "the choice of such @xmath54 value is dictated by the opportunity of restarting from the same conditions when hydrodynamic simulations are then performed .",
    "the pm part of the code makes use of 256@xmath55 cells and a smoothing radius of 520 kpc was taken for gravitational forces .    at @xmath51 clusters were then identified using a fof algorithm ; we considered as _ friends _ , particles at a distance @xmath56 ( @xmath57 is the mean particle separation ) .",
    "the 40 most massive clusters were then located ; the lightest one is made by 34 particles and has a mass @xmath58 .",
    "for each of these clusters an hydrodynamic simulation was then performed , using a treesph code .",
    "the hydrodynamical part of the code is based on the sph method ( hernquist @xmath35 katz 1989 ) .",
    "the gravitational forces are solved with a hierarchical tree algorithm and this part of the code is based on the public treecode of l. hernquist ( hernquist 1987 ) . in order to run the hdyrodynamical simulation we located the cluster center at @xmath51 and found all particles within a radius @xmath59 , where the cluster density is @xmath60 ( background density ) .",
    "such particles were traced back to @xmath54 , in the original simulation cube , and a smaller cube of side @xmath61 , enclosing all of them , was then located at the cluster center .",
    "we found the approximate scaling @xmath62 .",
    "a high resolution lattice of @xmath63 particles was set in the smaller cube and their position was then perturbed , using the same initial conditions of the cosmological simulations , implemented by additional waves to sample the increased nyquist frequency .",
    "this technique is similar to the one adopted by katz & white ( 1993 ) , navarro , frenk & white ( 1995 ) .",
    "we used two grids , for baryon and cdm particles , whose masses @xmath64 .",
    "the cube of side @xmath61 is then set inside a greater cube of side @xmath65 , with parallel sides and equal center .",
    "such greater cube is initially filled by @xmath63 cdm particles , whose spacing is double in respect of inner cube particles , and whose mass is @xmath66",
    ". then particles falling in the smaller inner cube are eliminated .",
    "heavier particle positions are also perturbed , according to the initial conditions of the cosmological simulation .",
    "finally , we use all particles inside a sphere , of radius @xmath61 and with the same center as cubes , for the high resolution treesph simulation .",
    "since we take a constant number of grid particles , their masses vary according to @xmath61 ; for the most massive cluster we met ( @xmath67 ) , it was @xmath68 .",
    "the softening parameter for gravitational forces ( @xmath69 ) was set to @xmath70 for gas particles and scales as @xmath71 .",
    "we use a tolerance parameter @xmath72 , without quadrupole corrections .",
    "viscosity was set as in hernquist @xmath35 katz ( 1989 ) taking their parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the minimum timestep was @xmath75 for gas particles and twice as much for cdm .",
    "in average each cluster required @xmath76hours of cpu time to be evolved from @xmath54 to @xmath51 on a risk 6000 elaborator .",
    "outputs from treesph simulations were preserved at various redshifts . among the smaller ones",
    ", we used @xmath770.15 , 0.10 , 0.049 and 0 ( @xmath78 ) .    in fig .",
    "2 we give a typical example of projected @xmath79 outputs , at a set of redshifts @xmath80 . already from such figure , it is clear that cdm clusters are rich of substructures and characterized by a fast substructure evolution . in fig .",
    "3 we show cdm and baryon distributions at @xmath51 for a typical cluster .",
    "such figure shows that the baryon distribution is significantly smoothed out in respect to cdm .",
    "this obviously reflect on s , although we shall report no quantitative details on this point here .",
    "clusters are expected to evolve by accreting lumps of baryons and cdm onto a deep potential well . as time elapses ,",
    "nearby lumps are gradually absorbed and cluster substructures tend to vanish .",
    "such behaviour is clearly visible also in fig .  2 .",
    "in fig .  4 , instead , we give 9 plots for the space containing the evolutionary tracks projected on 3 planes and at three different @xmath33 s .",
    "cross indicate the location of data clusters .",
    "filled dots refer to a single selection of simulated clusters .",
    "the trend visible in this selection of simulated clusters is however a general feature : a linear regression gives place to the dotted straight line reported in the plots .",
    "although real data do not show such a marked trend , a linear regression was performed also on them .",
    "the continuous lines show the results of such linear fits to data .",
    ".angular coefficients and standard deviations for linear fits .",
    "@xmath82 refers to data and simulations . in parenthesis",
    "we give also simulation errors from 20 bootstrap resamplings . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the extra input that we should eliminate , to obtain the probability that the observational data set is fit by artificial data sets , is the requirement of linear behaviour .",
    "this can be done by applying the generalization of the kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov test to 2dimensional data sets , proposed by peacock ( 1982 ) and widely tested by fasano @xmath35 franceschini ( 1989 ) .",
    "we shall refer to this estimate as pf2 test and more details on it will be given in appendix a. in table 3 we give the values of the single case of fig .",
    "4 and the averaged values of the pf2probabilities that the observational data set and each artificial data set are realizations of the same process , for each @xmath83 pair and each @xmath33 value .",
    "such average pf2probabilities are not so small as those reported in table 2 and essentially correspond to a @xmath84 discrepancy . however , even this sophisticated test is unable to work out a final value which takes into account all the above partial results .",
    "there can be however little doubt left that such a sequence of values , where a faster evolution in model in respect to data is systematic , could hardly be due to observational sample biases or to disregarding peculiar physical effects in the simulations , and is more likely to indicate that the model is not adept to reproduce real data .",
    "it has been known for several years that cobe normalized cdm yields a cluster abundance exceeding observation by a factor @xmath85 . in order to obtain a fair number of clusters , the quadrupole data has to be lowered down to @xmath86k , at more than 3@xmath87 s from the observational value .",
    "however , cdm models are still currently in use as reference models ; in fact , 0cdm models , mixed models or @xmath88 models , used to obtain fair fits of observational data on various scales , involve more parameters .    according to our results , however , even though cdm is normalized to yield a fair number of clusters , we can not expect their morphologies to be adequately approached by the model .",
    "this output is related to the slope of the transfered spectrum , as already outlined in sec .  1 , and as is expressed by the values of the _ extra power _",
    "parameter @xmath10 .",
    "it is however important and fairly unexpected that the effects of such different slope are already visible in the average evolutionary tracks , for a fairly narrow redshift range ( @xmath89 ) as the one we had in observational data .    in a forthcoming paper , based on work in progress",
    ", we shall extend this analysis to other cosmological models , whose transfered spectrum has a @xmath10value consistent with observations .",
    "this is important , in order to test how sensitive the power ratios @xmath83 are to the @xmath10 value and to check whether this test depends only on @xmath10 or , @xmath21 , also on the @xmath90 of the model considered .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank david buote for his useful comments .",
    "one of us ( s.g . ) wishes to thank sissa for its hospitality during the preparation of this work .",
    "0.3truecm as is known , the kolmogorov  smirnov ( ks ) test is used to evaluate the probability that 2 distributions on a single variable @xmath91 are produced by the same process . if @xmath92 events are located at @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , let @xmath95 give the fraction of events located at @xmath96 .",
    "clearly @xmath97 is discontinuous in each @xmath93 , where it increases by @xmath98 .",
    "let two sets of @xmath99 and @xmath100 events yield @xmath101 and @xmath102 ; the ks statistics is then defined as the maximum distance between them : @xmath103 and it can be shown that the probability that the two data sets are produced by the same process can be estimated , by using @xmath104 , as follows : let be @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "then such probability reads : @xmath107 ~. \\eqno ( a3)\\ ] ] various numerical routines exist which allow to evaluate such function with any desired approximation ( see , @xmath21 , press 1992 ) .",
    "while for one  dimensional distributions the meaning and the building of @xmath104 are simple ( it tells us the maximum difference of integrated distributions ) , in the case of two  dimensional distributions the events are not ordered and there is no immediate way of telling where such difference is maximum .",
    "a further problem is set by the degree of correlation amongst data .",
    "a limiting situation occurs if they locate along a straight line on a plane , and then the ks test would be suitable again .",
    "the problem was considered in detail by peacock ( 1982 ) and fasano @xmath35 franceschini ( 1987 ) , whose approach ( pf2 ) we shall briefly report here .",
    "if @xmath92 data are located on the 2dimensional plane @xmath108 and have average @xmath109,@xmath110 , let us first define @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "their correlation coefficient is then : @xmath113 ( notice that , for @xmath114 , the points would actually lie on a straight line ) .",
    "then , if we have two sets of @xmath99 and @xmath100 data , with correlation coefficients @xmath115 and @xmath116 , defined according to eq .",
    "( a4 ) , we define @xmath117 as square average correlation .    the basic point , however , amounts to define a 4value extension of the function @xmath118 , for each set of @xmath92 data : the 4 values are the fractions of data in each of the four _ quadrants _ set by the point @xmath108 where @xmath118 is evaluated . the pf2 statistics @xmath104 will be the maximum difference between @xmath101 and @xmath102 values , ranging both over points and quadrants . using such @xmath104 , the square average correlation @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , defined according to eq .",
    "( a2 ) , we then define @xmath121 \\eqno ( a6)\\ ] ] and , using eq .",
    "( a3 ) , we obtain the required probability .",
    "it ought to be outlined that there are some restrictions to the significance of these probability estimators .",
    "in general , they become safer as @xmath120 increases . however , in the one  dimensional case , the estimate is good for @xmath12220 ( corresponding to @xmath123 ) . in the two  dimensional case ,",
    "the restriction is already much stronger , as it must be @xmath124400 ( corresponding to @xmath125 ) , and the further condition that the probability found is @xmath126 is to be added .",
    "our sets of data and simulation points are therefore just adequate to meet the above conditions .",
    "this is important also in view of a step forward that could be considered : treating directly the 3dimensional distributions in the parameter space spanned by @xmath127 ( @xmath34 ) , instead of their two  dimensional projections .",
    "an algorithm extending the above test to 3dimensions is a straightforward generalization ; the range of validity of such algorithm , instead , should be accurately tested",
    ". a large portion of the work of fasano and franceschini ( 1987 ) amounted to perform such checks , for the two  dimensional case .",
    "however , the trend found beween 1 and 2 dimensions , seems to indicate that , in three dimensions , we need 2 sets of data containing @xmath128 points . as far as simulations are concerned , this requires just doubling our simulation set .",
    "data clusters , instead , are signicantly below such limit ."
