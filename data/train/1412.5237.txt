    "meanwhile the accuracy and the fast computation can be attributes of purely numerical techniques ( we refer to @xcite for a recommendable introduction into the subject ) , the availability of an analytical form for the approximate solution is a feature of some asymptotic methods , as , e.g. , the wkb method ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) or of the spectral parameter power series ( spps ) method ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in both the asymptotic and",
    "the spps methods there appear natural limitations on the largeness or smallness of the parameter @xmath7 . in the recent paper",
    "@xcite a method offering all the above mentioned advantages : accuracy , speed , analytical form of solution and , additionally , free of the limitations on the size of @xmath7 , was developed for equations of the form @xmath9 the method is based on the concept of transmutation operators introduced by delsarte in @xcite and later studied in dozens of publications ( see the review @xcite and the books  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "several recent results concerning the transmutation operators made it possible in @xcite to convert them from a purely theoretical tool into an efficient practical method for solving ( [ schr_intro ] ) and related spectral problems .",
    "apparently the availability of a good method for ( [ schr_intro ] ) signifies its availability also for ( [ sl_intro ] ) .",

    "this may lead to undesirable limitations and difficulties .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to develop the transmutation method directly for equation ( [ sl_intro ] ) with no necessity to transform it into ( [ schr_intro ] ) . for this we study the action of the liouville transformation on the transmutation operators as well as on the systems of functions involved , called formal powers , which emerge in relation with the spps method and are the main ingredient in the transmutation method @xcite .",
    "we prove that the liouville transformation maps formal powers of ( [ sl_intro ] ) into formal powers of ( [ schr_intro ] ) which gives us the possibility to develop the transmutation method directly for ( [ sl_intro ] ) and to prove corresponding estimates for the accuracy of approximation .",
    "moreover , we observe that final representations for approximate solutions of ( [ sl_intro ] ) do not involve the liouville transformation and apparently are not restricted by its applicability .",
    "one of the developed numerical examples confirms this observation and the applicability of the proposed method under weaker conditions than required by the liouville transformation .",
