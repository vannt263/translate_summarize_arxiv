    "the single molecular magnets(smms)have attracted much attention both for its scientific importance of studying fundamental issues and for its potential applications .",
    "the magnetic molecules \\{v6 } and \\{v15 } provide us a good platform for exploring these issues for the models whose total spins are not large",
    ". there have been beautiful investigations on these respects.@xcite + for latter use , let us briefly introduce the structures of the molecule \\{v6 } first . as was mentioned in the ref.@xcite , the molecular \\{v6 } is the abbreviation of the molecule ( cn@xmath8h@xmath9)@xmath10na@xmath11[h@xmath12v@xmath13o@xmath14(po@xmath12)@xmath12\\{(och@xmath15)@xmath16cch@xmath15oh}@xmath15]@xmath18 14h@xmath11o whose structure is shown in fig.[v6 ] .",
    "we see that the molecule consists of two pieces , each of which is an isosceles triangle . in each triangle ,",
    "two of the spin exchange constants are equal(shown in blue @xmath19 ) and the third one is smaller(shown in red @xmath20).@xcite the experiment has shown that there is a kind of special interaction called dzyaloshiky - moriya ( dm ) interaction@xcite between the two triangles , whose hamiltonian can be written as @xmath21.@xcite the operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the total spin operators of two triangles , respectively , and the energy gap @xmath24 is tiny .",
    "however , such an interaction can make contributions to the landau - zener - stckelberg ( lzs ) transition@xcite when the magnetic field is absent .",
    "the lzs effect can be detected by measuring the magnetization of the molecule \\{v6}.@xcite +    , and the red line is the third exchange interaction constant @xmath25 .",
    "there is dm interaction @xmath21 between the two triangles.[v6],width=188,height=188 ]    in ref.@xcite , the wave functions of molecule \\{v6 } and the experimental measurements of the system have been shown clearly .",
    "however , from the theoretical point of view , each triangle of the molecule \\{v6 } is formed by three spins , and the symmetry properties of the triangle desire to be investigated . in this article , we first focus on triangle of a molecule \\{v6 } , and introduce a new symmetry operator @xmath3 to re - describe the triangular piece .",
    "we can see that the commutativity between such a new symmetry operator @xmath3 and the hamiltonian of the triangle @xmath26 will constrain the parameters in @xmath26 leading to @xmath27(see eq.([relationtriangle ] ) ) .",
    "the symmetry operator @xmath3 looks a natural description for the triangle model in the molecular \\{v6}. further we shall extend such a new symmetry to a four - spin heisenberg model . using the extended symmetry operator @xmath3 in the four - spin system , the hamiltonian @xmath4 for a parallelogram will be restricted . by analyzing the hamiltonian @xmath4 , we find that the ground state can be with total spin @xmath5 in some special cases , which has not been considered before . based on this assumption",
    ", we make a prediction on the magnetization of a theoretical molecule `` \\{v8 } '' which is comprised of two parallelograms with the dm interaction between them in analogy to the molecule \\{v6}.@xcite to test the parallelogram model itself , we propose another molecular model in analogy to \\{v15 } and give the prediction of its local spin moments configuration .",
    "+ this article is organized as follows : in sec.[sec-2],we shall investigate the single heisenberg spin triangle model in \\{v6 } and introduce the new quantum number operator @xmath3 to re - describe the model .",
    "we shall show that the operator @xmath3 represents a new symmetry in the three - spin system . in sec.[sec-3 ]",
    ", we shall extend the symmetry to a system comprised of four @xmath2-spins and establish its hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "we demonstrate that the ground state of @xmath4 allows to be with total spin @xmath5 in some special cases . besides",
    ", we make up a theoretical molecular model called `` \\{v8 } '' in which the yangian interaction between the two parallelograms is introduced and the prediction of its magnetization is made . in sec.[sec-4 ] , we discuss another molecular model which contains only one parallelogram and give the prediction about its local spin moments configuration . in the appendix , we shall show details about how the symmetry operator determines the hamiltonian .",
    "as was mentioned in the sec.[sec-1 ] , a molecule \\{v6 } is comprised of two triangles with a tiny dm interaction between them . in this section , we shall concentrate on only one triangular piece in a molecule \\{v6}. it has been verified that the triangle model is actually isosceles by the experiment.@xcite hence the \\{v6 } problem has been well - established both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "however , in this section we would like to introduce a new symmetry operator @xmath3 to re - describe the triangle system that can be extended to more @xmath2-spins system .",
    "+ the model of the heisenberg spin triangle is comprised of there spin-@xmath2 particles , whose hamiltonian is written as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the spin operators of three particles , and the relationship for the interaction constants @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 is unknown . if a magnetic field is applied along @xmath35 axis , then the term corresponding to the zeeman energy @xmath36 should be included in eq.([tri]).the zeeman term can split the energy levels with different eigenvalues of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the total spin operator of the triangle . obviously , only the quantum numbers @xmath39 and @xmath37 are not adequate to describe a system with three spins .",
    "it is easy to see that there are two different eigenstates corresponding to the same quantum numbers @xmath40 . +",
    "the new symmetry operator @xmath3 that we shall introduce is written as @xmath0 , where the operator @xmath1 is a special form of the dm interaction in the heisenberg spin triangle written as : @xmath41 it can be verified that such a new operator satisfies the commutation rules as @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "so we shall use the operator @xmath3 to represent certain symmetry property of the three - spin system just like what we have done in the hydrogen atom.@xcite ( in mathematics physics , the operator @xmath1 is in fact a special form of the yangian operator , see appendix.[mathyang ] . )",
    "the operator @xmath3 can be viewed as a collective quantum number that describes the history besides @xmath44 and @xmath37 .",
    "if we take the set @xmath45 to be the complete operator set of the system , the commutativity @xmath46 is wanted to be satisfied .",
    "based on such a constrain , we can easily get @xmath47 fortunately , this relationship @xmath27 has been shown to exist in molecule \\{v6}@xcite . with this symmetry the hamiltonian in eq.([tri ] ) can be simplified as : @xmath48 we emphasize that in the triangle model , the eigenvectors of the operator @xmath3 are nondegenerate , so the yangian symmetry operator @xmath3 can uniquely determine the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "the complete set @xmath49 can be used to determine the states in triangular piece in the \\{v6 } model described in sec.[sec-1 ] . by directly diagonalizing the matrix @xmath3 in the usual lie algebraic representation",
    "( see appendix.[thspin ] ) , we get the two states with total spin @xmath50 as : @xmath51 which are corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath52 of @xmath3 respectively . it can be verified that these states are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath53 , and the corresponding levels are @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "+ hence , the special dm interaction operator @xmath1 plays an important role in the heisenberg spin triangle in \\{v6}. its square @xmath3 is a new quantum number operator representing the yangian symmetry .",
    "using @xmath3 we can easily determine the form of the hamiltonian and directly obtain the eigenstates of the system .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to extend such a yangian symmetry to a four - spin system that will be discussed in the next section .",
    "for a system comprised of four particles with each spin @xmath2 the general form of the hamiltonian can be written as : @xmath56 and the yangian operator is defined by : @xmath57 which is identical with the special dm interaction operator for the four - spin system .",
    "for a four - spin system with the yangian symmetry @xmath58 should be a quantum number operator .",
    "similar to the three - spin system in the sec.[sec-2 ] , we shall get the constrain for the parameters in eq.([4hamilton ] ) based on the commutativity @xmath46 . to calculate the commutation relation , we need get the eigenstates of @xmath3 first , and then let the hamiltonian @xmath59 share the same eigenstates with @xmath3 .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath3 are shown as eq.([eigeneqation ] ) in the appendix.[fspin ] .",
    "it should be noted that the eigenvectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 are degenerate in eq.([eigeneqation ] ) .",
    "the eigenstates with eigenvalue @xmath62 can be linear combinations of the two degenerate states .",
    "in fact , the combination is a @xmath63 rotation on the eigenvectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 because of the orthogonality and normalization of the eigenvectors .",
    "so we need to introduce an additional variable @xmath64 to indicate the general eigenstates with @xmath62 as follows : @xmath65 in this situation , only the eigenstates as eq .",
    "( [ degenerate ] ) can be considered as the ones of the hamiltonian @xmath59 with quantum number @xmath66 letting @xmath59 share the same eigenvectors with @xmath3 , through careful calculation shown in appendix.[fspin ] , we obtain the hamiltonian of the four - spin system as eq .",
    "( c.10 ) . in a special case ( @xmath67 ) ,",
    "we find the relations for the exchange interaction constants in eq.([4hamilton ] ) due to the @xmath3-symmetry : @xmath68 so the hamiltonian can be written as a simpler form @xmath69 the hamiltonian shown by eq .",
    "( [ 4hm ] ) is actually a parallelogram model as shown in fig.[fig2](a ) , where there are only two independent exchange constants called @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    , and the blue represent @xmath71 .",
    "( b ) ( color online ) the model of the extended \\{v6}-type molecule , the interaction between the two parallelograms is @xmath72 , which is totally similar to the \\{v6 } molecule .",
    "[ fig2],title=\"fig:\",width=151 ] , and the blue represent @xmath71 .",
    "( b ) ( color online ) the model of the extended \\{v6}-type molecule , the interaction between the two parallelograms is @xmath72 , which is totally similar to the \\{v6 } molecule .",
    "[ fig2],title=\"fig:\",width=170 ]    the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ 4hm ] ) are as follows : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the quantum number of @xmath37 and the eigenstates are shown by eq.([eigenvec ] ) in the appendix.[fspin ] .",
    "if a magnetic field is applied , the states with different quantum numbers @xmath74 will split because of the zeeman effect .",
    "when the field is weak enough , we emphasize that the singlet state is not always the ground state .",
    "in fact , the ground state depends on the values of the exchange constants . by choosing some suitable constants",
    ", we can get the ground states with total spin @xmath5 .",
    "for example , when @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , the energy levels are @xmath77 , so the ground state is latexmath:[\\ ] ]    where @xmath74 is the magnetic quantum number .",
    "however , a symmetric @xmath3 requires @xmath183 .",
    "so the first term of the eq.([yang ] ) must vanish , and the the yangian operator is identified with special form of the dm interaction operator . in terms of eq .",
    "( c.3 ) the eigenvalues and the eigenstates of the @xmath3 are : + @xmath184                        @xmath187 , we must take the six states @xmath188 @xmath189 @xmath190 @xmath191 @xmath192 @xmath193 as the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , from which we can get the relationship for the interaction constants :      and the constants @xmath70 , @xmath195 and @xmath71 satisfy the equation : @xmath196 hence , the general four - spin hamiltonian with the yangian symmetry can be written as : @xmath197 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath195 satisfy the eq.([app - rela2 ] ) . if we take the viable @xmath64 to be zero , then the eq.([app - rela1])and([app - rela2 ] ) reduced to the eq.([relation ] ) which leads to the special parallelogram model , and the hamiltonian eq.([gen ] ) reduces to eq.([4hm ] ) .",
