    "in our previous paper  @xcite , we investigated the relationship between the information theoretic and thermodynamic entropies , which was originally discussed by brillouin in a general context  @xcite and later clarified by landauer and bennett in the study of the physics of computation . in the resolution of the maxwell s demon paradox based on the szilard engine model  @xcite ,",
    "the link between the two entropies vividly manifested in the form of the information erasure principle  @xcite . generalizing landauer - bennett s argument",
    ", we showed that the optimal work cost of information erasure for arbitrary probabilities is indeed exactly equal to the amount that keeps the second law of thermodynamics inviolated . in order to do so without relying on the second law , we made use of the optimality of shannon s data compression , which is independent of physical laws .",
    "namely , due to the optimal data compression , the minimum work cost of information erasure was shown to be @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the information theoretic ( shannon ) entropy  @xcite given by @xmath3 for a binary probability distribution @xmath4 . also , @xmath5 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath6 is the temperature of the heat bath with which the gas is in contact .",
    "the cost @xmath7 is manifestly expressed in terms of @xmath2 , rather than the thermodynamic entropy @xmath8 , hence the clear equivalence between the two entropies @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we pursue our information theoretic approach to thermodynamics further by enduing the demon with a turing machine . to be specific",
    ", we derive the form of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , which gives the rate of particles possessing energy @xmath9 in an @xmath10 particle system in equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath11 where @xmath6 is the temperature of the heat bath that is in contact with the particles .",
    "a significance of the present work is in showing that the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , which is a key ingredient of statistical mechanics , can in fact be seen as a consequence of the optimal reset of memory that records the particle states .",
    "the memory is modeled solely on the basis of the thermodynamic combined gas law .",
    "our model of the particle - memory system can also be applied to generic non - equilibrium processes and we shall present a simple demonstration of the dissipation - fluctuation theorem without using statistical mechanics , unlike the original derivation  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we recapitulate the resolution of the maxwell s demon paradox in the case of biased probability distribution  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we describe our _ thermo - turing machine _ , in which the particles are manipulated by maxwell s demon according to information in a turing - machine - like apparatus . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , we derive the maxwell - boltzmann distribution in the scenario of the thermo - turing when the system is in equilibrium . section  [ sec:5 ] is for the generalization of the previous section to systems of arbitrary number of energy levels .",
    "we shall consider an application of the model to non - equilibrium statistical mechanics by reproducing the dissipation - fluctuation theorem for a near equilibrium case in sec .",
    "[ sec:6 ] .",
    "section  [ sec:7 ] is devoted to summary and discussions , mentioning an idea that our model essentially mimics a markovian process and that universal gates on the turing - memory side simulate the interactions of particles in the system .",
    "appendices are for a note on the two entropies and for a comparison between our derivation of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution and that by jaynes  @xcite .",
    "let us recapitulate the resolution of the maxwell s demon paradox with an asymmetric szilard engine .",
    "the engine contains a single molecule gas in the cylinder and a partition is to be inserted to divide the whole volume @xmath12 into @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "first , the demon inserts the partition into the cylinder and measures the position of the molecule .",
    "second , he ties a weight at the side in which he found the molecule .",
    "the demon lets the gas expand isothermally at temperature @xmath6 to push the partition to the end of the cylinder .",
    "this expansion provides the demon with @xmath16 of work , where @xmath17 is the thermodynamic entropy .",
    "finally , the demon removes the partition to close the cycle of the asymmetric szilard engine .",
    "it looks as if the demon could extract work from a heat bath without leaving any trace in the state of the gas .",
    "this apparent violation of the second law of thermodynamics is called the maxwell s demon paradox  @xcite .",
    "the key to the resolution of this paradox is in the fact that the demon keeps information on the molecule s position in his memory .",
    "the physical process of memory reset should also be taken into account to complete the cycle  @xcite .",
    "no costs are assumed for the actions of inserting and removing the partition , tying a weight , measuring the position of the molecule  @xcite , and computing inside the memory  @xcite .",
    "it is most natural and judicious to consider a symmetric physical configuration for the ( binary ) memory , in terms of transparency of the discussion .",
    "thus , the necessary amount of work to erase one bit of information is @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "it is emphasized that only the combined gas law is used to evaluate the erasure work , avoiding the use of the second law , let alone statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "the demon operates the asymmetric szilard engine for sufficiently many times to accumulate the data regarding molecule s positions .",
    "then he carries out the optimal data compression , whose compression factor is equal to the shannon information entropy @xmath19 . after compressing the data",
    ", maxwell s demon resets the memory according to the model we introduced above .",
    "therefore , the difference between the work to reset the memory and the one extracted by the szilard engine per cycle asymptotically approaches zero , @xmath20 as the length of the data sequence tends to infinity . that is , the second law remains intact and the maxwell s demon paradox  @xcite is resolved .",
    "note that the data can not be compressed in the original case of the symmetric szilard engine , i.e. , the cylinder with a partition inserted at its center  @xcite .",
    "also , eq . ( [ cancellationofwork ] ) strongly corroborates the equivalence between the thermodynamic and information theoretic entropies in the case of the optimal information processing and thermodynamical operation .",
    "see more details in appendix .",
    "[ ack01 ] .",
    "the primary components of our model are a set @xmath21 of @xmath10 particles with two energy levels @xmath22 and @xmath23 , a long tape @xmath24 , on which a sequence of @xmath10 memory cells are embedded , and maxwell s demon who are capable of manipulating the particles states and the tape .",
    "we will denote the energy gap between the two levels of the particles @xmath9 , and assume that each particle is numbered to make a correspondence with a memory cell .",
    "the tape of memory cells can be thought of as the one we typically consider in the context of turing machine . each memory cell can store a binary information , either 0 or 1 , and it can be modeled as a one - molecule gas with a partition at the center of cylinder .",
    "the whole system @xmath25 is supposed to be in contact with environment ( heat bath ) of the temperature @xmath6 .",
    "suppose that initially the particles are all in their ground state @xmath22 and the values stored in the memory are all @xmath26 .",
    "some mechanism , whose detail is irrelevant to the present discussion , excites some of the particles to @xmath23 , and the demon changes the information in the tape , monitoring the state changes of the particles .",
    "let @xmath27 be the rate of the excited particles , i.e. , @xmath28 particles are in the excited state , while @xmath29 in the ground state .",
    "let us consider the amount of work @xmath0 that the entire system ( @xmath25 ) can potentially exert towards the outside , when we let it return to the original state , where all particles are in the ground state and the memory tape contains only a sequence of @xmath26 s .",
    "the energy stored in @xmath21 contributes to @xmath0 positively , and its amount is @xmath30 . on the other hand , in order to make the data on the tape all @xmath26 , we need to consume some energy @xmath7 , as a cost to erase information . as a result , we have @xmath31",
    "since we are naturally interested in the optimal ( largest ) value of @xmath0 for a given @xmath27 , @xmath7 needs to be minimized .",
    "thus , we have @xmath32 @xcite , which leads to @xmath33    we shall define the equilibrium to be the state whose @xmath0 is stable against small noises on either the tape or the particles .",
    "let us now describe a physical scenario that justifies the consideration of the stability of @xmath0 as condition for equilibrium . because we now focus on the stability of the equilibrated state",
    ", we imagine a process in which the state starts from equilibrium and a small number of errors occur .",
    "the condition of the equilibrium requires that the particle system stays in equilibrium under the repetition of this process .",
    "so , in the initial state , there are @xmath28 particles in the excited state and all the memory cells of the tape store @xmath26 .    for the following scenario ,",
    "we need a carnot engine @xmath34 that is operated between two heat baths , i.e. , those of two different temperatures , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the engine @xmath34 is used to pump up the energy level of particles by providing work taken from heat baths .",
    "the temperatures are thus chosen so that the work by @xmath37 is equal to @xmath9 .",
    "in other words , they should satisfy @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the amount of heat flow from the heat bath of @xmath35 to the engine and @xmath41 is that to the heat bath of @xmath42 from the engine . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that the expansion ( compression ) rate of the volume is @xmath43 , thus @xmath44 .",
    "another component is a work reservoir , which is a standard gadget in thermodynamics and typically modeled by a spring .",
    "it is a mechanism that can keep mechanical energy , and we can either extract energy from it or add extra energy to it when necessary",
    ". the net change in the stored energy in the work reservoir should be zero when a thermodynamic cycle is completed .",
    "( if an excess energy was still stored at the end of a cycle , it can be discarded as heat into the heat bath . )",
    "we then consider the following cycle , consisting of steps ( a)(g ) ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cycle ] ) .",
    "the particles are initially in equilibrium with the heat bath of temperature @xmath6 : @xmath28 of them are excited , and all of @xmath10 memory cells contain @xmath26 . since the particles should always be in a reasonable physical state when seen from the outside , all artificial manipulations in the cycle are designed to be performed on the memory tape ; the tape is subject to only occasional ( natural ) errors .",
    "we also assume that the demon knows the value of @xmath27 , having operated the system for a long time .    1 .",
    "the demon lets @xmath45 memory cells expand to the end isothermally at temperature @xmath6 .",
    "each cell does @xmath46 of work , and the demon stores the energy of @xmath47 in the work reservoir .",
    "2 .   the demon inserts a partition at the centre of the cylinder of those @xmath45 cells , so that a half of @xmath45 cells represent the value @xmath26 and the other half have @xmath48 .",
    "3 .   the demon applies data decompression , the inverse operation of shannon s data compression , on all @xmath10 cells .",
    "after the decompression , @xmath28 cells will be in @xmath48 and the rest in @xmath26 . since this operation is reversible , it can be designed so that no energy consumption is required .",
    "the demon re - sorts the data sequence , according to the states of particles , so that if the @xmath49-th particle has the energy @xmath50 ( @xmath51)the @xmath49-th cell contains the value @xmath52 . no energy consumption is needed .",
    "5 .   during some fixed time @xmath53 ,",
    "a small number ( @xmath54 ) of errors would occur in the tape .",
    "an error can be modeled as a not operation applied on a randomly chosen cell .",
    "6 .   detecting the cells where an error occurred",
    ", the demon changes the states of the corresponding particles .",
    "he transfers energy from the particles to the work reservoir and vice versa , depending on the direction of the change .",
    "the demon erases all data in the tape , which now stores @xmath55 bits with @xmath56 being the new rate of 1 s .",
    "the minimum work is @xmath57 , a part ( or all ) of which would be supplied by the work reservoir .    .",
    "the ` @xmath58 ' sign in ( b ) represents a randomized memory state with no physical distinction between @xmath26 and @xmath48 ; the molecule can move around in the whole configuration space of the cylinder .",
    "the demon operates both the memory tape and particles , sitting ( standing ) in between them . ]",
    "the data sequence returns to @xmath59 , while @xmath60 particles are now in the excited state .",
    "the random not in the step ( e ) may be a physical error to particle state , rather than a computational error to the memory state .",
    "such a physical error can be triggered by thermal fluctuation , thus the energy for flipping the state is supplied by its environment in this case . in the above scenario ( steps ( a)-(g ) ) , on the other hand , a computational error occurred to the memory without energy supply , and then the demon changed the particle state accordingly by taking energy from the heat bath .",
    "so the net physical effect and the energy balance are the same",
    ".    the detection of errors in the step ( f ) may seem to require an additional memory , which is as long as the tape , to keep the data in the previous cycle .",
    "if so , we would need to take another erasure cost as well , making the story cumbersome .",
    "fortunately , the demon can detect errors simply by comparing the data stored in a cell and the state of the corresponding particle .",
    "the necessary number of memory registers is negligible compared with the length of the tape .",
    "one might naively wonder why we do not simply encode the particle state to the tape without the steps ( a)-(c ) .",
    "the point is the energy @xmath61 that we can extract from the heat bath exploiting the initial low entropy state .",
    "although it may look unnecessarily complex , we believe that it is the most natural scenario in which the stability of @xmath0 manifests as a condition for equilibrium .",
    "there is a one to one correspondence between the physical state @xmath62 in the phase space of classical particles of @xmath21 and the computational state @xmath63 of the tape of the turing machine @xmath24 .",
    "this correspondence is guaranteed in the two ways .",
    "that is , @xmath64 by measurement of @xmath62 and its encoding in @xmath63 , and @xmath65 by readout of @xmath63 of the turing machine and a subsequent operation of the carnot engine @xmath34 .",
    "equilibrium is characterized by the balance between the energy income and expenditure in @xmath66 against small errors to @xmath63 , which we model by random operations .",
    "arbitrary operations can be simulated by not and toffoli gates , since any reversible computation can be executed by these two .",
    "once a not or toffoli operation occurs to a randomly chosen cell , the demon activates the carnot engine @xmath34 to change the state of the corresponding particle .",
    "let us start with an intuitive picture of equilibrium .",
    "suppose there are more @xmath26 s than @xmath48 s .",
    "then random nots tend to equalize the populations of @xmath26 s and @xmath48 s in the tape . as the number of @xmath26 s approaches that of @xmath48 s , the demon has to consume more energy to excite particles from @xmath22 to @xmath23 . at the same time",
    ", the bit string on the tape becomes less compressible , thus larger information content , which means that more work would be needed to erase it .",
    "this energy for erasure can be paid by the particle system .",
    "so the whole system can be said to be in equilibrium , if these increases in energies for state excitation and for information erasure are equal .",
    "the net energy balance in the process from ( a ) to ( g ) is simply a sum of the energy transfers in the steps ( a ) , ( f ) , and ( g ) .",
    "it is @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the above cost is equal to the change @xmath70 of the function introduced in eq .",
    "( [ the_f_function ] ) . since the number of errors is small , i.e. , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "when the system is in equilibrium , @xmath73 , thus @xmath74 the same equation holds in the case where the not gate hits a cell of @xmath48 to change it to @xmath26 .    noting that @xmath75 $ ] , we see that eq .",
    "( [ balance ] ) reduces to @xmath76 which is nothing but the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "a similar calculation can be done for the case in which the toffoli gate is considered as an error operation .    to sum up the maxwell - boltzmann distribution ( [ boltzmann ] )",

    "the equilibrium condition in terms of the work extractable from @xmath25 .    as well as the combined gas law in elementary thermodynamics .",
    "let us now evaluate the second order effect .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that the average change in the information - theoretic entropy due to a random not is @xmath77 noting that the transition @xmath78 takes place with probability @xmath79 , which increases @xmath27 to @xmath80 , while the transition @xmath81 occurs with probability @xmath27 , which decreases @xmath27 to @xmath82 .",
    "this makes a change of @xmath83 , each term of which can be expanded as in eq .",
    "( [ secondorder ] ) .",
    "the total cost change by the random toffoli gate is computed as @xmath84 note that the first order contributions , i.e. , the terms having @xmath85 , cancel out due to the equilibrium condition .",
    "the effect of the random toffoli gate is essentially equivalent to that of the random not gate except for the overall probability factor @xmath86 for having two @xmath48 s in the control bits .",
    "therefore , the sum of the second order contribution of the random not and toffoli gates is @xmath87 h^{\\prime \\prime } ( p ) \\frac{\\ln 2}{2n } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + { \\cal o } \\left ( \\frac{1}{n^2 } \\right ) ( > 0 ) .",
    "\\label{toffoli}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is , the change @xmath88 by the random not and toffoli gates tends to strengthen the local stability of the cost function @xmath0 near the equilibrium .",
    "this further supports our definition of equilibrium in the thermo - turing model .",
    "it is also noted that the quantity in the square bracket is the effective computational complexity .",
    "the above argument to derive the boltzmann distribution can be generalized to the case of _ _ dit__s .",
    "that is , the cells of the tape can store @xmath89 values from 0 to @xmath90 , and the particles have @xmath89 energy levels from @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath93 be the ratio of the number of cells storing the value @xmath52 to the total number of cells on the tape .",
    "suppose that the @xmath49-th particle is excited to the state @xmath94 when the @xmath49-th cell stores the value @xmath52 .",
    "this state preparation can be completed by a similar mechanism to the one above , where a carnot engine @xmath34 is operated depending on the data in cells . here",
    ", we can think of @xmath90 engines , @xmath95 .",
    "the engine @xmath96 is switched on when the measurement apparatus @xmath97 finds @xmath52 in a cell , and then @xmath96 dispenses energy @xmath50 to the corresponding particle .",
    "each engine thus utilizes two heat baths of temperatures @xmath98 and @xmath99 so that @xmath100  @xcite , where all engines are assumed to be operated between two volumes , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "we will use another notation @xmath103 to indicate the engine @xmath96 operated in the reverse direction .    instead of the random",
    "not studied in the previous section , let us suppose random swap operations that change the value in a single cell .",
    "let @xmath104 denote a swap between two values @xmath52 and @xmath105 , namely , @xmath104 maps a value @xmath52 of a randomly chosen cell to @xmath105 and vice versa .",
    "note that the not operation between two levels is effectively the same as the swap between them .",
    "once such a @xmath104 is applied to the @xmath49-th cell , which stores the value @xmath52 ( assume @xmath106 without loss of generality ) , the mechanism @xmath97 activates @xmath103 and then @xmath107 to change the state of the @xmath49-th particle : @xmath103 retrieves energy @xmath50 from the particle and discard it to the heat bath at @xmath108 , and @xmath107 gives @xmath109 of energy to it .",

    "this can be viewed as an aspect of the markovian process , in which the information on the earlier configuration is lost due to , e.g. , the multiple - scattering of particles by the cylinder wall .",
    "the corresponding process in our model is the erasure of information , which occurs when the partition in the memory cell is removed . to lose the information on the molecule s position",
    ", we need to wait for a while until it becomes impossible to infer the molecule s trajectory .    as a byproduct",
    ", we can see that the extensivity of the thermodynamic entropy follows from that of the shannon entropy .",
    "note also that eq .",
    "( [ thvsinf ] ) can be viewed as the boltzmann formula @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the number of possible states under a given total energy .",
    "in the work on the relation between information theory and statistical mechanics , jaynes derived the corresponding equilibrium state ( [ general_eq ] ) in the following way  @xcite .",
    "the plausible probability distribution is determined by the requirement that the estimator function @xmath170 is maximized under a given average energy @xmath171 with @xmath172 . following shannon  @xcite",
    ", he required the mathematical properties for the estimator @xmath170 : ( i ) @xmath173 is a continuous function of @xmath93 , ( ii ) @xmath174 is a monotonic increasing function of @xmath133 , and ( iii ) @xmath170 satisfies the composition law . from these mathematical requirements ( i)-(iii ) , the estimator is uniquely determined to be equal to the shannon entropy , i.e. , @xmath175 . maximizing the shannon entropy under the constraints that @xmath176 is fixed and @xmath172 ,",
    "the plausible probability distribution is obtained to be the one in eq .",
    "( [ general_eq ] ) .",
    "note that the temperature does not come in from the physical assumption but is defined so that the free energy thereby obtained coincides with the helmholtz free energy .    in the present work ,",
    "we have devised a model consisting of a memory tape ( information theoretic object ) and a set of particles ( physical system ) , both of which are in contact with a heat bath of temperature @xmath6 and are operated by the demon .",
    "then , we have defined the equilibrium state operationally and subsequently derived the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "thus , the temperature dependence of the distribution was naturally obtained , whereas it was not so in jaynes mathematical work .",
