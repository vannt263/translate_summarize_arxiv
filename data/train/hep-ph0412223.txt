    "the electroweak production of single top quarks is an important standard model process which the tevatron is guaranteed to be able to study .",
    "this reaction , which has been investigated previously @xcite , is interesting both because it provides a direct measurement of the @xmath1 ckm  element and because it is sensitive to deviations of top quark physics from standard model predictions , in particular , through their effects on the top - bottom-@xmath0 vertex @xcite .",
    "limits on single top production from run i at the tevatron have been published @xcite , and the first run ii limits have appeared @xcite . in this article",
    "we discuss methods which we hope will improve the significance of the measurement by using more information encoded in the shape of the signal , in a way that will be less sensitive to systematic errors than a simple counting experiment .",
    "however , we also show that the size of the @xmath0-plus - jets background , and the difficulty of predicting it accurately , represent a serious obstacle .",
    "single top production is a very unusual process . at fermilab energies , the @xmath2  production of a top quark and bottom antiquark by an @xmath3-channel @xmath0 boson , as can occur through the diagram in fig .",
    "[ tbboth]a ,    [ ptbh ]    tbboth.eps    has a lower cross - section than @xmath4@xmath5-channel @xmath0 boson of a @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and an extra light - quark jet near the beam axis , as occurs through diagrams such as that in fig .",
    "[ tbboth]b . and",
    "@xmath6 as part of the scattering process or whether the initial state contains a @xmath7 parton directly , _",
    "i.e_. , the splitting process is part of the incoming wave function .",
    "since the @xmath6 jet is generally not used in the analysis below , a careful examination of this separation is not essential for us . ]",
    "the @xmath4 process has a distinct shape , both because of its unusual initial state , the hard light - quark jet ( which has large @xmath8 and large pseudo - rapidity ) in the final state , and correlations between this jet and the lepton from the top decay . in this paper",
    ", we will explore a method for using these features to help separate single top from its major backgrounds : @xmath9 , @xmath0 plus jets , and qcd events .",
    "this separation using the shape of the event is essential , because a simple counting experiment is extremely difficult to carry out .",
    "both our studies and recent data indicate that the size of the relevant @xmath0-plus - jets background is larger than anticipated a few years ago.@xcite this is compounded by other issues , such as the 2% decrease in fermilab s energy compared to expectations , and lower cross - section calculations for the signal @xcite .",
    "we are concerned that systematic errors in the understanding of the background will plague a direct counting experiment at a level that will make any claims of discovery suspect .",
    "thus , in our view , additional methods , independent of ( but perhaps to be used in conjunction with ) a counting experiment , are needed even for a discovery of the process , as well as for a precision measurement .",
    "we will argue that it is necessary , and possible , to reduce backgrounds further by using more information about the final states .",
    "( note that a shape fit using a single variable was used in @xcite . )",
    "however , even with these improvements , our results suggest that the measurement of single top remains challenging .",
    "we have found that there is no simple way , even with 3 fb@xmath10 of integrated luminosity , to achieve both good statistics and a satisfactory signal - to - background ratio .",
    "the essential problem , compared to earlier and more optimistic studies @xcite , is that the @xmath0-plus - jets sample with a single @xmath7-tagged jet is larger , less predictable , and more variegated than was understood a few years ago .",
    "we will discuss in some detail the difficulties with this background , and the need for a wide range of efforts to bring it under control .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the general structure of the events expected for both signal and background events .",
    "section iii includes a detailed discussion of how we have simulated both types of events , the cuts used to define the event samples , the expected ( and observed ) differences between signal and background event shapes , and new observables intended to highlight these differences . in section",
    "iv we address the essential issues of uncertainties , both statistical and systematic , with a special focus on the difficulties inherent in understanding the background arising from @xmath0 boson production accompanied by jets . in the final section",
    "we summarize our analysis and our conclusions .",
    "from fig .  [ tbboth]b one can see that a @xmath4 event has a final partonic state consisting of at least the following : a charged lepton , a neutrino , @xmath7 and @xmath6 quarks , and a light quark .",
    "the bottom quark that comes directly from the initial gluon tends to have small transverse momentum , and is rarely in the pseudo - rapidity  and @xmath8 range necessary to be identified by @xmath7-tagging algorithms .",
    "thus , in selecting @xmath5-channel signal events , one asks for ( a ) one or more @xmath7-tagged jets , ( b ) significant missing energy ( from the neutrino ) , ( c ) one and only one isolated @xmath11 or @xmath12 , ( d ) at least one untagged jet .",
    "typically , the highest-@xmath8 untagged jet in a @xmath5-channel event is that from the light quark .",
    "also , in typical events a @xmath5 quark can be reconstructed from the tagged jet and a @xmath0 , itself reconstructed from the charged lepton and the missing energy .",
    "the kinematics of the event tend to prefer a total visible scalar - summed transverse energy of order @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath2 process has a @xmath7 quark jet and a @xmath14 jet , along with a lepton and a neutrino . in a significant number of events ,",
    "one of the two @xmath7-jets will not be tagged , so that the same criteria used for @xmath4  one @xmath7-tagged jet , missing energy , a charged lepton and an untagged jet  will have moderately high efficiency for this process as well .",
    "since the @xmath2 process is smaller in cross - section and considerably less distinctive in shape than @xmath4 , and therefore harder to separate from background , it makes sense for us to optimize our approach for @xmath4 .",
    "we will not , in this paper , discuss the measurement of the @xmath2 and @xmath4 channels separately , as this will only be possible well after the initial measurements of the combined production process .",
    "the main backgrounds to single top production , which all can imitate the signature just described , are @xcite ( 1 ) @xmath9 , top quark pair production , primarily from events where only one of the top quarks decays leptonically , but also from events with two leptonic decays ; ( 2 ) qcd  events with fake missing energy and with either a fake lepton or a lepton from a heavy flavor decay ; and , most problematic , ( 3 ) @xmath15  events with a leptonically - decaying @xmath0 plus some number @xmath16 of quark or gluon jets .",
    "top quark pair production is a formidable background to all single top channels .",
    "after both top quarks decay , there are two high-@xmath8 @xmath7 quarks , which typically give rise to at least one @xmath7-tagged jet , and two @xmath0 bosons which can decay hadronically or leptonically .",
    "the signature for single top will be mimicked if only one @xmath0 decays leptonically , or if both do and only one charged lepton is detected .",
    "the present measurement of the cross - section for @xmath9 production has a large uncertainty , though this uncertainty is expected to drop to around 10% @xcite by the end of run ii .",
    "however , even this systematic uncertainty would prohibit observation of single top above the @xmath9 background , so a substantial amount of @xmath17 must be cut away .",
    "the contribution of @xmath17 with one hadronically decaying top is especially problematic , since often the leptonically - decaying top quark can be reconstructed . on the other hand",
    ", this background can be reduced using the fact that these events tend to exhibit considerably more transverse energy than true single top events , to have more jets , and to be more spherical .",
    "these kinematic handles are not present for events where both top quarks decay leptonically , but such events are suppressed by both the leptonic decay branching fraction and our requirement that only one @xmath11 or @xmath12 be observed in the detector .",
    "furthermore , the accurate reconstruction of a leptonically - decaying top quark is more difficult in such events .",
    "pure qcd events can give rise to fake leptons and provide heavy - flavor jets ( or jets which have no heavy - flavor but are mistagged . ) as fluctuations in energy measurement can lead to a fake missing @xmath18 signal , these qcd events form a background to single top production .",
    "while the energetics tend to be lower than in signal events , and the invariant mass of the `` lepton '' , missing energy and @xmath7-tagged jet exhibits no peak at @xmath13 , the number of events is so large that it is not obvious , without data ( or a complete detector simulation ) , whether this represents a relevant background .",
    "recent results from dzero @xcite indicate that the number of qcd events entering their single - top samples ( defined by somewhat different cuts than used here ) is smaller than for other backgrounds , and is , in first approximation , comparable in size to the single - top signal .",
    "this conclusion depends in detail on cuts and on the flavor of the lepton ( muons being more prevalent than electrons in their samples ) and may differ for cdf . as we will see , the methods that we describe below provide substantial further reduction of this qcd background and the systematic errors associated with determining it , to the point that it should not pose a serious issue . consequently , we will largely disregard the qcd contribution to the sample , except for a discussion in sec .",
    "iii.d as to when and why this is justified .",
    "the @xmath0-plus - jets background is much more challenging .",
    "the @xmath15 events potentially entering the sample consist of a real @xmath0 boson decaying leptonically , and at least two other quarks or gluons in the final state .",
    "while the @xmath15 events do tend to have smaller energetics than single top , and do not have a reconstructible @xmath5 quark , the number of events is so large , and the energy resolution at fermilab is sufficiently broad , that the @xmath15 events form a large and problematic background to single - top production .",
    "the difficulties involved in simulating @xmath15 events have been discussed elsewhere @xcite and we will not give a full review , but it is important to note that there are special problems for the sample with a single @xmath7-tag that neither untagged nor double - tagged samples suffer from . in particular , many different partonic processes , with different shapes ,",
    "contribute to the sample in a fashion which is difficult to predict accurately .",
    "we will discuss this in detail in section iv.d .",
    "as we will see , reducing the systematic error on the prediction and/or measurement of this process is essential for success .",
    "to model both signal and background , we have used madevent @xcite to generate events , pythia @xcite to then simulate showering and hadronization ( using the default value of the initial shower scale , @xmath19 ) , and pgs @xcite to act as a fast detector simulation .",
    "the single top @xmath3- and @xmath5-channel cross - sections have been normalized to 0.88 pb and 1.98 pb respectively @xcite , and generated with factorization and renormalization scales @xmath20 gev . for the @xmath17 process , the cross - section is normalized to 6.7 pb @xcite and generated with factorization and renormalization scales also at @xmath21 gev . for the @xmath15 channel ,",
    "we have limited our simulations to @xmath0-plus - two - jets ( henceforth @xmath22 ) at the madevent level , since we believe the uncertainties in our simulations of this process are as large as the contribution at the next order in @xmath23 .",
    "samples for the @xmath22 channel were generated using a renormalization and factorization scale @xmath24 , which is selected to give the correct normalization at next - to - leading order @xcite .",
    "we employ cuts at the madevent level of @xmath25 , @xmath26 gev ( where @xmath27 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath28 jet ) , with angular separation @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath7-tagging is simulated as follows .",
    "jets containing a @xmath7 quark ( either perturbatively or produced during showering ) are taken to be tagged with an efficiency of the form @xmath31 , where @xmath8 is the transverse momentum of the jet .",
    "jets containing a @xmath32 quark ( either perturbatively or produced during showering ) are taken to be tagged with a rate of the form @xmath33 , while jets containing no heavy flavor are taken to be mistagged with a rate of the form @xmath34 .",
    "form of the mistagging function is _ not _ what is used in the default pgs detector simulation , which instead is @xmath35 .",
    "based on the fact that this function leads to large mistagging rates at very high @xmath8 , in contradiction to measurements at cdf @xcite , we have changed this mistagging function within pgs to a @xmath36 form .",
    "the overall mistagging rate that we use is larger than assumed in other papers , including @xcite and the recent work of @xcite , where the size of @xmath15 backgrounds is smaller as a result .",
    "the true form of the mistagging function is detector- and algorithm - dependent , and different mistagging functions do change the shape of certain distributions .",
    "our results suggest that uncertainties in this function lead to important , but not dominant , systematic uncertainties in the @xmath15 background . ]    from the events generated in this fashion , we define our initial event sample to be those events that contain _ one and only one _ isolated charged lepton , missing energy , _ one or more _",
    "@xmath7-tagged jets , and _ one or more _ untagged jets .",
    "these objects satisfy the `` basic '' cuts listed in table [ cuts1 ] .",
    "the @xmath8 constraints in this and later tables apply only to the highest-@xmath8 @xmath7-tagged jet and the highest-@xmath8 untagged jet .",
    "additional cuts are necessary in order to bring backgrounds down to a reasonable level .    given that @xmath15 tends , compared to the signal , to have lower energy and fewer jets , and that @xmath9 tends to have higher energy and more jets , there are two natural choices of variables to cut on that take advantage of the overall kinematics of the events without appealing to event shapes .",
    "one possibility is to cut on the total transverse energy of the event ; a second would be to cut on the number of high-@xmath8 jets .",
    "the question of which of these ( or whether a combination thereof ) has the lowest theoretical uncertainties has not been resolved and we will not attempt to answer this very important question definitively here . for this study",
    "we have chosen to cut on the quantity @xmath37 where the sum is over all jets with @xmath38 gev and @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the magnitude of the transverse momentum of the @xmath28 jet , @xmath41 that of the lepton , and @xmath42 is the missing transverse energy in the event .",
    "large values of @xmath43 tend to favor @xmath9 final states , while lower values favor @xmath15 final states , with the signal contribution peaking at intermediate values .",
    "furthermore , since the signal involves a @xmath5-quark , we also impose a requirement that the invariant mass of the lepton , neutrino , and the leading tagged jet be approximately equal to the top quark mass . in doing so",
    ", we must reconstruct the neutrino s momentum component @xmath44 along the beam axis , which has an ambiguity .",
    "we require that @xmath45 , and among the two solutions for @xmath44 we choose the solution with smallest absolute magnitude .",
    "( for complex solutions , only the real part is used . )",
    "as suggested earlier , we find that such cuts can not decrease the backgrounds to the point that they are comparable to the signal .",
    "two choices of intermediate  and hard  cuts are indicated in tables [ cuts2i ] and [ cuts2h ] .",
    "the resulting numbers of expected events for an integrated luminosity of 3 fb@xmath10 , summing over @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( and thus including both @xmath5 and @xmath46 ) , can be seen in table [ results1 ] .",
    "we show the number of events which survive both the basic cuts of table [ cuts1 ] , the intermediate cuts of table [ cuts2i ] , and the hard cuts of table [ cuts2h ] .",
    "consistent with @xcite , we find that while all of the cuts contribute to the background reduction , the @xmath15 channel is reduced primarily by a combination of the stiffer @xmath8 cuts and the @xmath47  cut , while the @xmath48 background is affected primarily by the upper @xmath43 cut .  while the basic cuts reveal a signal to background ratio of approximately 1:21 , this improves to 1:7.4  and 1:4.9  using the intermediate and hard cuts .",
    "this is , at best , disappointing .",

    "for example , consider this ratio for the `` basic cuts '' results in table [ results1 ] yielding a ratio of 0.065 .",

    "the jet veto used in @xcite ( the last column in their table 3 ) only reduces the background from @xmath17 ( and also the signal ) , and does not help reduce the @xmath22 background . ]",
    "we believe the main effects can be accounted for straightforwardly .",
    "first , in the present study we have the benefit of recent next - to - leading - order calculations @xcite , which increase the overall rate for @xmath15 by of order 50 % compared to that used in @xcite .",
    "( in our leading - order computations , this is effectively obtained through our lower choice of renormalization scale . )",
    "second , we find a much larger number of tagged jets in the @xmath15 channel , because we include ( by simulating parton showering ) the fragmentation of leading - order partonic gluons into heavy flavor jets at subleading orders .",
    "( this effect would appear already in a next - to - leading - order calculation , such as performed recently in @xcite . )",
    "third , our more pessimistic estimate of energy resolution at the fermilab detectors forces us to use a wider @xmath13 window cut in order to have sufficient acceptance for the signal ; this lets in more @xmath15 background .",
    "fourth , we use a more pessimistic @xmath7-tagging rate ( 50% _ vs _ 60% ) and light - quark - jet mistagging rate ( 1.0% _ vs _",
    "0.5% ) , a more pessimistic charm - to - bottom ratio in tagging ( 1:3.3 _ vs _",
    "1:4.0 ) , and more realistic @xmath8 distributions in tagging functions ; these all hurt the signal - to - background ratio and the efficiency for the signal .",
    "other small negative effects include a lower center of mass energy ( 1.96 tev _ vs. _ 2.00 tev ) , and a lower cross - section for the signal ( due largely to a change in parton distribution functions . )",
    "note also that we have used @xmath79 gev , so our results may even be slightly optimistic in this regard .",
    "the numbers in table [ results1 ] suggest that a further factor of 35 improvement in the signal - to - background ratio via more aggressive cuts will come at the cost of a factor of 510 reduction in the signal accompanied by a factor of 1545 reduction in the background .",
    "the essential question then is whether a reduction by such a large factor can be achieved without large systematic and theoretical errors . from table",
    "[ results1 ] , one can see that systematic errors below about 10% in @xmath15 are needed for a discovery .",
    "unfortunately , the method for removing the background suggested in @xcite , namely , to use a jet veto to reduce @xmath17 to a small contribution , and do a sideband analysis on either side of the @xmath13 window cut to remove @xmath15 , is unlikely to work with such a large @xmath15 background .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mtdistrib ] . with basic cuts , the @xmath15 background ( whose `` @xmath13 '' distribution falls steeply and monotonically above @xmath80 gev ) is very large , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mtdistrib]a .",
    "a sideband analysis with a window centered around @xmath81 gev would be subject to large statistical errors .",
    "meanwhile , the intermediate and hard cuts , shown in figs .  [ fig : mtdistrib]b and [ fig : mtdistrib]c , tend to shape the @xmath15 events such that the @xmath15 background is no longer monotonic near and/or across the @xmath13 window , making a sideband analysis problematic .",
    "thus the shape of the `` @xmath13 '' distribution of the @xmath15 background after hard cuts must be predicted , with small errors .",
    "we will argue later that this is very difficult .",
    "consequently , we doubt that a straightforward counting experiment can yield , on its own , a satisfactory measurement of the cross - section for the production of single top .      under the assumption that a counting experiment is insufficient , we turn to observables that ( as in @xcite ) make use of other aspects of the signal . in particular , we will now explore variables that take advantage of the very special shape of single top production compared to the background , and are less subject to , or less sensitive to , systematic errors .     as noted earlier , the dominant production process is @xmath4 , in which there is a hard lepton , and also a hard untagged jet @xmath82 with pseudo - rapidity  @xmath83 and @xmath8 typically larger than @xmath84 gev .",
    "this strongly forward or backward jet is a distinctive signature which the backgrounds do not share .",
    "the @xmath7 jet from the @xmath5 decay tends to be produced centrally ( low pseudo - rapidity ) with high-@xmath8 , and is typically the tagged jet ( for which reason we only use the tagged jet in the @xmath5 reconstruction . )",
    "the other @xmath7 jet tends to have low @xmath8 ; it is often unobserved , and is rarely tagged @xcite .",
    "importantly , the @xmath4 process arises from an initial state light quark or antiquark ( typically a valence quark carrying moderate to large bjorken-@xmath85 ) scattering off a gluon ( typically carrying lower @xmath85 . )",
    "this unusual initial state has important kinematic consequences . because of this kinematic effect , the structure of the proton , and the details of the electroweak theory , the @xmath4 signal has strong and distinctive correlations and asymmetries which we can use to separate it from the backgrounds .",
    "first , the unusual kinematics and the structure of the proton combine in an interesting way .",
    "the creation of positively - charged top quarks ( and consequently positively - charged leptons in the final state ) in the @xmath86 process requires either a @xmath87 or @xmath88 in the initial state , so that a @xmath89 can be emitted from the quark line . since a reasonably large value of bjorken-@xmath85 is necessary in order to produce the top quark , the required initial state is most often obtained from a valence quark striking a gluon . the most likely initial state uses a valence @xmath87 quark from the @xmath90 ;",
    "the next most likely draws a valence @xmath88 from the @xmath91 , and thereafter we must draw on the sea quarks from either @xmath90 or @xmath91 . since the quark usually has larger @xmath85 than the gluon that it strikes , the @xmath86 system is typically boosted in the direction of travel of the initial quark .",
    "consequently , for @xmath5 quarks , the @xmath86 system is more likely to be boosted in the proton direction than in that of the antiproton , by a factor of roughly 2:1 .",
    "the reverse is true for @xmath92 production .",
    "moreover , the light - quark jet in the final state , converted from the quark in the initial state by the emission of the @xmath0 , tends to travel in the proton direction when a @xmath5 is produced and in the antiproton direction when a @xmath93 is produced .",
    "thus , because of the differences between the @xmath87 and @xmath94 parton distribution functions in the proton , and because of the quark - gluon initial state , large asymmetries under parity p and charge conjugation c result .",
    "these show up strongly in the differential cross - section both for the top ( and the positively charged lepton in its decays ) and for the hard forward or backward light - quark jet .",
    "second , the momentum vectors of the lepton and the light - quark jet are correlated , as a result of both kinematics and spin polarization effects .",
    "the structure of the electroweak interactions ensures that the spin of the top quark tends to align with the momentum direction of the light - quark jet .",
    "since the top decays before this spin information is lost , it is transferred to the momentum of the final - state charged lepton . in the @xmath5 rest frame the lepton momentum and jet momentum",
    "tend to align @xcite .",
    "the boost of the top quark relative to the lab frame , whose sign is also aligned with the momentum direction of the jet , further tends to push both lepton and jet into the same hemisphere .",
    "these properties strongly distinguish the @xmath4 process from its @xmath9 background . at tree - level",
    ", @xmath9 is separately c and p invariant .",
    "clearly this is true of the process @xmath95 , since the initial state is p - invariant on average .",
    "it is also true of the process @xmath96 , because the intermediate gluon state is a c - eigenstate ; this is the same as in @xmath97 , where there is no forward - backward asymmetry in the @xmath98 distribution .",
    "the parity - invariance is violated at the next order , due to radiative effects @xcite ; this is a few percent effect , both small and calculable .",
    "moreover , there should be no strong correlation between the momenta of the lepton and the jets in the final state . in those @xmath17 events which have both low @xmath43 and a reconstructable semileptonically - decaying top quark",
    ", one or two jets from the hadronically - decaying top tend to be lost or mismeasured .",
    "meanwhile any high-@xmath8 untagged jets whose momenta we might choose to compare with that of the lepton will also stem from the hadronically - decaying top .",
    "the accidents which lead to the selection of any given jet as part of our analysis should largely wash out any correlation of its momentum with that of the lepton .",
    "indeed , our simulations show that in @xmath17 the correlation between the lepton and the highest-@xmath8 untagged jet ( which we will use in our analysis below ) is roughly a 10% effect .",
    "similar considerations apply , to a good approximation , to those qcd events which might pass our cuts .",
    "parity asymmetries for these events are small .",
    "the charge of a fake leptons is unrelated to its momentum direction .",
    "consequently , all distributions for events with fake leptons are invariant under flipping the sign of the lepton charge ; as we will see , this imples that these events have p - invariant distributions for the observables we will choose .",
    "isolated leptons from heavy flavor stem mainly from @xmath99 and @xmath100 events ; these have similar c and p properties to @xmath17 , so we expect small parity - asymmetries",
    ". meanwhile , a fake lepton and the highest-@xmath8 untagged jet in the event should be essentially uncorrelated .",
    "however , if this jet contains heavy flavor , then a correlation can arise when the lepton observed in the event is from a wide - angle semileptonic decay of a heavy - quark within the jet .",
    "the precise size of jet - lepton correlations from this source is unknown to us , and is detector- and cut - dependent .",
    "the small overall number of qcd events entering the single top samples at dzero @xcite suggests that qcd contributions to jet - lepton correlations are not a major issue for the single top measurement , except possibly in the case of muons from heavy flavor decays .",
    "we will return to this possible exception in section iii.d .",

    "this situation is made explicit in table [ tagfrac ] , which shows the cross - section for various @xmath22 channels , before and after the requirement of a single tag , and table [ budget ] , which lists the relative contributions from the various @xmath22 channels to the single tagged sample .  as with all our simulations",
    ", these contributions were calculated using madgraph @xcite to evaluate the parton cross sections , pythia @xcite to provide showering and hadronization , and pgs @xcite as the detector simulation of jet identification and tagging .",
    "the total @xmath133 cross - section ( before tagging ) was normalized to the one - loop result @xcite .",
    "the basic cuts of table [ cuts1 ] were used ; note that an untagged jet was also required in the event .",
    "the labels @xmath269 in the first column indicate the perturbative final state at tree - level ( as evaluated in madgraph ) ; here @xmath270 represents a light quark or antiquark ( @xmath271 ) .",
    "in table [ tagfrac ] , the cross - section for each channel , before and after the requirement of a single tagged jet , is shown ; also shown is the ratio of after - tagging to before - tagging ( _ i.e. _ , the fraction of each channel containing a single tagged jet . ) in table [ budget ] , the three central columns divide the tagged events by whether the jet that was tagged in the event contained a bottom hadron , a charm hadron , or no heavy flavor .",
    "for example , the entry in the @xmath7-jet column of the @xmath230 row indicates that 11 percent of the entire @xmath15 single - tag sample arises from @xmath230 events ( @xmath272 in which the tagged jet contains bottom hadrons , mainly due to the splitting @xmath273 in the parton showering .",
    "in determining the entries in table [ budget ] from those in table [ tagfrac ] , we have attempted to correct for any double counting .",
    "for example , we have subtracted the contribution to the @xmath7-jet @xmath234 entry ( from @xmath273 in the parton shower ) arising from events with kinematic configurations already present in the @xmath7-jet @xmath249 entry .",
    "this leads to small corrections , of order the stated @xmath274% uncertainty , in several of the entries .",
    "the central feature of these tables is the multitude of contributions to the tagged sample , all of similar magnitude .  as clearly visible in table [ tagfrac ] ,",
    "the large parton - level cross - sections for the light quark and gluon processes are reduced by a low tagging fraction , while the much smaller tree - level heavy - quark cross - sections are subject to much larger tagging rates .",
    "consequently , within the single - tag sample , all such partonic processes end up contributing at roughly at the same level , as is clear in the `` after - tagging '' column of table [ tagfrac ] , and in the `` total '' column of table [ budget ] .",
    "the breakdown of the resulting single - tag sample by the fraction of the sample for which the tagged jet is a bottom jet , a charm jet , or a jet without heavy flavor is visible in table [ budget ] ; as the numbers in the bottom row indicate , all contributions are again of the same order .",
    "the simulations were performed with statistics sufficient to ensure such that each entry in table [ budget ] is subject to an _ additive _ statistical uncertainty of order 23% .",
    "however , the systematic uncertainties in the simulations are much larger , due to a host of important physical and technical issues .",
    "since these systematic uncertainties are the most important obstacle to an accurate background estimate , we now discuss them in detail .",
    "consider first the uncertainties in the basic event simulation .",
    "a precision simulation of the @xmath22 sample can not , at present , be carried out .",
    "the parton - level theoretical computation of the differential cross - section for @xmath0 plus two or more high @xmath8 jets has been advanced in recent years : @xmath22 has been calculated to next - to - leading order , and @xmath275 is known at leading - order . while the program mcfm  @xcite can provide accurate next - to - leading - order parton - level cross - sections , no event generator valid at next - to - leading order currently exists .",
    "consequently , there is at present no possibility of simulating this background without significant theoretical uncertainties .",
    "moreover , even when a next - to - leading - order event generator becomes available , there are serious questions concerning showering algorithms that must be addressed .",
    "the main problem is associated with the splitting of gluons to heavy quarks ( or more precisely , with tuning pythia or herwig to simulate correctly the process in which a partonic gluon generates one or more jets containing charm or bottom mesons . ) as illustrated in table [ budget ] , a substantial fraction of the single - tagged sample , of order 33% in our simulations , originates from this process .",
    "it is not known with confidence how often gluons at short distance lead to jets with charm or bottom hadrons , or how often this process leads to two jets rather than one .",
    "studies on this issue that compare data from lep @xcite and tevtron @xcite with qcd expectations @xcite and with pythia and herwig suggest that there is no serious disagreement .",
    "however , this conclusion rests on the substantial uncertainties ( of order 30% ) in both the experimental and the theoretical results .",
    "generally the perturbative predictions ( including resummed logarithms ) and the monte carlo results ( with default parameters ) tend to underestimate the observed rates of heavy flavor production in parton showers .",
    "also , the rough agreement speaks mainly to overall rates of heavy - flavor production , not to charm - to - bottom ratios or kinematic distributions .",
    "given the large sensitivity of the single - tag sample to these effects , it appears that a sizeable uncertainty in both the normalization and shape of the @xmath15 background arises from this source .",
    "a related issue is the role of uncertainties in parton distribution functions .",
    "the single tag sample receives significant contributions from events with charm in the final state that arise from initial states containing non - valence partons .",
    "examples include processes such as @xmath276 , @xmath277 , and @xmath278 .",
    "these processes have varying shapes and rates , and depend on the poorly - determined parton distribution functions .",
    "even if one could precisely simulate these events , there is still the issue of determining the efficiencies for tagging of jets with bottom or charm quarks , and for mistagging of jets with neither .",
    "thus must be done as a function of @xmath8 and pseudo - rapidity . as indicated in table [ budget ] , each of these tagging processes plays a comparable role in determining the @xmath22 sample .",
    "uncertainties in tagging functions thus lead to uncertainties in the shape of @xmath15 which can not be ignored .",
    "an especially serious issue is that the ratio of @xmath32 to @xmath7 tagging rates is currently extracted not from data but from monte carlo programs , which , among other problems , are dependent upon the correct modelling of gluons splitting to heavy flavor .",
    "clearly , it would be beneficial to decrease the mistagging and charm - tagging efficiencies _ relative _ to the efficiency for tagging of bottom jets .",
    "this would improve the ratio of the signal to the @xmath15 background , reducing sensitivity to systematic errors , and also would directly suppress some of the main sources of uncertainty in the prediction of @xmath15 .",
    "however , tuning the @xmath7-tagging algorithm to improve purity of the sample generally comes at the cost of a small reduction in the @xmath7-tagging efficiency , which in turn decreases the signal and increases statistical errors .",
    "the right balance between these competing issues is detector- and luminosity - dependent and must be left to the experimental collaborations .",
    "another related concern is the subtle linkage between @xmath7-tagging , jet definitions , and gluon splitting .",
    "when a gluon splits to two heavy quarks , the probabilities to obtain one tagged jet , two tagged jets , or one tagged and one untagged jet depend upon all three issues .",
    "this may mean that the separation of the samples with one tag versus two tags is unstable and not well predicted by theory .",
    "it is for this reason that we have chosen to consider samples with one - or - more tagged jets .",
    "alternatively , one might require strong angular separation between tagged jets in order to retain predictivity .",
    "a further issue involves the potentially large sensitivity of the shape and normalization of the multi - channel @xmath279 background to the cuts used to bring backgrounds under control .  in particular , both the @xmath43 and @xmath13 cuts used in the current analysis and in recent experimental papers @xcite reshape the @xmath15 background .",
    "while it has been shown @xcite that jet vetoes are effective at substantially reducing the size of @xmath9 backgrounds , we would argue against the use of this approach .",
    "the systematic errors which jet vetoes introduce into the prediction of the @xmath15 background has not been quantified , but we expect it is prohibitively large .",
    "we are especially concerned about the requirement of two - and - only - two jets employed in @xcite .",
    "we believe this will make the prediction of @xmath15 unreliable , both because of problems with qcd corrections , and because of failures to correctly model the rate at which gluons in parton - level processes lead to zero , one or two jets containing heavy flavor .",
    "there is at present no consensus as to the safest method for reducing @xmath9 , or , for that matter , @xmath15 .",
    "we would like to argue strongly that this is a very important problem , which our methods simultaneously mitigate and highlight .",
    "on the one hand , neither the @xmath162 nor the @xmath163 distribution is strongly sensitive to the overall size of @xmath280 .",
    "consequently , the use of a strong jet veto or harsh @xmath43 cut is unnecessary , and indeed unjustified to the extent systematic errors in @xmath15 become larger as a result .",
    "our approach would instead prefer a method which cuts @xmath9 less severely , and in a safer fashion , such that theoretical errors in predicting @xmath15 remain small .",
    "the @xmath43 cut that we use is , we believe , safer , being a cut on a more inclusive variable ; whereas the splitting of one jet into two , due to a fluctuation or a changed jet algorithm , affects a jet veto in a dangerous way , this is not so for an @xmath43 cut . but this safety is only relative ; there are problems with jets moving above or below the minimum @xmath8 required for a jet to be included in the variable @xmath43 that we defined . in any case , our method requires less focus on reducing the size of @xmath17 and more focus on keeping @xmath15 as small and as predictable as possible .    with all these problems in view , any method used to extract the @xmath15 background will have to pass many cross - checks .",
    "one important consistency check can be carried out by calibrating monte carlo simulations using both @xmath15 and the process @xmath281-plus - jets ( @xmath282 ) , where the @xmath281 decays leptonically .",
    "the processes @xmath15 and @xmath282 do not have the same shapes , rates , and heavy flavor content , so one can not directly take ratios of distributions or even of overall cross - sections .",
    "however , the overall kinematics of @xmath282 is similar to @xmath15 , and is similarly sensitive to all of the above - mentioned issues . for these reasons",
    ", we expect that matching a monte carlo to the rates and shapes of the @xmath282 and @xmath15 distributions from data , with zero , one or two tagged jets , will significantly reduce systematic uncertainties .",
    "such matching will require adjusting parameters which affect the splitting of gluons to heavy flavor , and adjusting tagging functions .- plus - jets data , with 3 fb@xmath10 of integrated luminosity , for this analysis to be carried out .",
    "] it would also be very helpful if direct measurements of the bottom - content , charm - content , and non-@xmath7/non-@xmath32 content of the various single- and double - tagged @xmath15 and @xmath282 samples could be carried out , even with low precision and confidence .",
    "this would allow direct tests of numerous monte carlo predictions that at present have very large uncertainties .",
    "studies of the @xmath283 to @xmath284 ratio have been carried out @xcite , but the challenging study of @xmath285 separately should also be considered as statistics improve .    in summary ,",
    "determining the single - tagged @xmath15 cross - section will require a carefully crafted combination of theory , data , and theory - optimized monte carlo .",
    "a counting experiment for discovery of electroweak single - top production appears very challenging . in an effort to improve the situation ,",
    "we have explored the possibility of using the distinctive shape of this process to separate it from background .",
    "we use as observables the pseudo - rapidity @xmath286 of the leading-@xmath8 untagged jet and the pseudo - rapidity @xmath287 of the charged lepton , weighted by the charge of the lepton @xmath110 .",
    "( one of these variables was already used in @xcite . )",
    "considering the distributions of signal and background in the @xmath222 plane ( where @xmath288 and @xmath289 ) , we have noted that the distributions for @xmath17 and for qcd are largely symmetric , while that of the signal is not ; the @xmath15 ( @xmath0-plus - jets ) background is intermediate between them .",
    "constructing functions @xmath290 , defined in eqs .",
    "( [ fbardef])-([fminusdef ] ) , which have various symmetry properties , we have shown that the statistical and systematic errors in the functions @xmath170 , which are orthogonal to the function @xmath198 that would be used in a counting experiment , can be brought close to reasonable size without using extreme cuts .      *",
    "all cross - sections ( @xmath291 ) were calculated at tree level . *",
    "these were then normalized to theoretical calculations at next - to - leading order .",
    "for @xmath15 , only the sum of all channels was normalized in this way . *",
    "all processes were run through pythia , to simulate showering , and through the detector simulation pgs .",
    "* we imposed hard @xmath103 cuts on the leading tagged and untagged jets , and required that a top quark be reconstructable from the lepton , tagged jet , and missing energy .",
    "we applied an @xmath43 cut aimed at reducing @xmath17 ; we did not use a jet veto .",
    "* @xmath8-dependence of tagging fractions was accounted for , with the maximal tagging rates at high @xmath8 for @xmath292 being taken as @xmath293 .",
    "the details of the analysis are sensitive to these numbers , as well as to the rate for hard gluons at leading order to evolve into jets containing heavy flavor .",
    "* we did not attempt to simulate qcd events .",
    "instead , we argued qcd effects are ( in theory ) sufficiently symmetric in shape and ( from dzero data ) sufficiently small in rate that their contributions to all useful observables can be neglected ( with the possible exception , for dzero , of @xmath176 in the muon channel . ) * we discussed important shape effects on @xmath17 at next - to - leading order @xcite , which we expect to be about ten percent or less , but did not simulate them .",
    "it should be noted that we have not optimized our cuts to improve efficiencies and reduce systematics in a rigorous way .",
    "indeed , it would not be too useful to do so , since the optimization is a moving target , depending on integrated luminosity , on tagging rates and other detector details , on next - to - leading - order shapes , and on monte carlo assumptions .",
    "we believe , therefore , that our results could be improved upon through such an optimization , though this is only worth doing in a concrete analysis .",
    "we also have not explored whether other methods of reconstructing @xmath13 might be more effective , or whether variables other than @xmath43 might be better as far as both statistics and systematics .",
    "this is certainly something that should be done as the integrated luminosity increases .",
    "moreover , there is a natural extension of our method which we did not consider , but which should be explored if the integrated luminosity becomes sufficiently high .",
    "our observable @xmath176 focussed on lepton - jet psuedo - rapidity correlations , but as we pointed out , these correlations can have two sources : _ inherent _ correlations in the rest frame of the @xmath4 system ( or of the top quark itself ) and correlations which are _ induced _ by the boosting of these frames into the lab frame",
    ". both of these effects are present in the signal , and they add coherently to give a large contribution to @xmath176 .",
    "one could imagine measuring the two effects separately .",
    "this could potentially allow for even greater separation of signal from background .",
    "\\1 ) our method largely removes @xmath17 and qcd events from the observables @xmath225 , making extreme cuts on @xmath194 unnecessary , and focussing attention on @xmath15 as the main background .",
    "while the statistical fluctuations from @xmath17 are still important , they are of less concern than systematic errors on @xmath15 , since the former scale as the square - root of the @xmath17 rate , while the latter scale linearly with the @xmath15 rate .",
    "moreover , the @xmath9 background is much more safely calculated and simulated , and will be , in the end , easier to remove . in our approach to single top , _ one should not cut hard on @xmath17 if doing so causes the systematic uncertainties in @xmath15 to increase substantially_. in particular , this argues against the use of a severe jet veto , in which events with more than two observed jets are discarded .",
    "\\2 ) the method that we have introduced requires that the shapes of @xmath17 and @xmath15 be properly modeled , but it also provides for cross - checks . the function @xmath198 measures the total background , and , assuming @xmath17 can be determined using other samples , this allows a measurement of the total @xmath133 background .",
    "meanwhile , there is a region in the @xmath165 plane where the @xmath163 function gets small contributions from both signal and from @xmath17 .",
    "this region allows a check of whether the shape of @xmath15 has been correctly understood , as well as being interpretable as a worthwhile test of the standard model itself .",
    "\\3 ) the thorniest problem obstructing the measurement of single top is understanding the shape of the @xmath15 background .",
    "this is a large and irreducible background which must be subtracted from the signal , even in the context of the methods we proposed here .",
    "this subtraction could be done directly , using our cuts , but this requires some prediction of the shape in the @xmath165 plane .",
    "alternatively , a sideband analysis around the `` @xmath13 '' window cut could be applied to @xmath170 , in appropriate pseudo - rapidity windows , but this too requires prediction of the effect of cuts on the distribution of @xmath15 in `` @xmath13 '' and pseudo - rapidity .",
    "while theory , monte carlo and data all can , and must , assist with these subtractions , many different types of uncertainties plague the sample with a single @xmath7-tag ( and therefore the sample with one - or - more @xmath7-tags ) , making it unclear how to bring all the available resources together .",
    "we believe that a dedicated study , examining the rates , shapes , and flavor content ( especially of bottom versus charm ) of both @xmath15 and @xmath282 , with zero , one and two tagged jets , will be necessary .",
    "this will require a blend of multiple measurements , theoretically precise predictions , and careful tuning and cross - checking of monte carlo simulations .",
    "since this issue affects many other measurements , including the higgs search and numerous beyond - the - standard - model searches , we view this as a very high priority .",
    "\\4 ) there are very few paths toward reducing the @xmath15 background relative to the signal .",
    "one clear need is to decrease the mistagging rate and charm - tagging efficiency while maintaining or increasing the @xmath7-tagging efficiency ; this would both improve signal - to - background and reduce some of the uncertainties that make it difficult to model the background .",
    "another important step would be taken if the resolution in reconstructing the top quark mass from the @xmath7 , lepton and missing energy could be improved .",
    "this would allow a narrowing of the @xmath13 window cut , which would both reduce the size of the @xmath15 background and reduce experimental and theoretical uncertainties in any sideband analysis .",
    "beyond this , one would need to consider more radical ideas , such as finding methods which could , on average , differentiate bottom jets from charm jets , bottom jets from antibottom jets , and/or jets formed by short - distance heavy quarks from jets formed by gluons that have split into roughly - collinear heavy quark pairs .",
    "in conclusion , our method for extracting single - top confirms that one can use the distinctive shape of the signal to reduce backgrounds more effectively than in a pure counting experiment .",
    "however , we also find that backgrounds are much worse than was once thought .",
    "improvements in ( mis)tagging rates and in the understanding thereof , careful modeling of @xmath0-plus - jets cross - checked against both theory and data , and more theoretically trustworthy techniques for cutting away backgrounds will all be necessary for a robust measurement of single top production .",
    "the single - tag @xmath0-plus - jets background , in particular , represents a challenge that the whole community must meet head - on .",
