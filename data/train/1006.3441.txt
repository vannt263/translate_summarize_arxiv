    "there has been a long interest in the study of the dynamics of vacuum bubbles in different background cosmology  @xcite .",
    "presumably , these bubbles may be formed in the course of phase transitions in the early universe or arise from inhomogeneities generated by quantum fluctuations during inflation . in these studies ,",
    "the bubble is modelled as a spherically symmetrical region of true or false vacuum which is separated by a domain wall from the exterior world such as minkowski , de sitter , or friedmann - robertson - walker spacetime .",
    "the motion of the domain wall , which is analyzed under the general - relativistic thin - wall approximation , characterizes the global structure of the spacetime .",
    "for example , dependent on initial conditions , an observer in the interior will describe a inflating bubble universe while an observer in the exterior will describe the bubble as a black hole .",
    "recently , the possibility of a string landscape  @xcite has opened a new perspective on the vacuum bubble dynamics .",
    "the string landscape is considered as a complicated potential energy function in a multidimensional moduli space with a plentitude of local minima separated by barriers of various heights .",
    "one of these minima corresponds to the vacuum where our universe exists today and the evolution of the very early universe is determined by the route that the universe has taken in the landscape .",
    "however , a detailed mapping of the structure of the landscape is still elusive .    in the string landscape ,",
    "a local minimum is a metastable de sitter vacuum with certain energy scale , tunneling down successively through potential energy barriers to vacua with lower vacuum energies via bubble nucleation .",
    "when tunneling is taking place , various regions of the spacetime are inflating in various de sitter vacua , resulting in a very complicated global spacetime structure with a hierarchy of vacuum bubbles separated by domain walls .",
    "typically , the height of the barrier between the vacua is of string scale , so the tunneling rate in the landscape is expected to be exponentially suppressed and far below the expansion rate of the inflating region .",
    "consequently , most part of the spacetime undergo eternal inflation , with some regions occasionally tunneling to a landscape with a flat potential that drives slow - roll inflation or to anti de sitter vacua with negative cosmological constant .",
    "development in the understanding of false vacuum decay in the string landscape has recently been made .",
    "it was found that under certain conditions the decay rates can be greatly enhanced even for tall barriers due to resonant tunneling in the presence of multiple vacua  @xcite , due to stringy effects such as tunneling via the dirac - born - infeld action  @xcite , by an effect that facilitates giant leaps in the landscape  @xcite , or by having exponential prefactors  @xcite . in light of this , it is possible that the tunneling rate is not smaller than the expansion rate of the de sitter phase and thus a few or even copious vacuum bubbles may be formed within a hubble radius .",
    "this may lead to bubble collisions  @xcite with one of the domain walls near our horizon , or the formation of black holes and wormholes that induce new metric perturbation during slow - roll inflation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , sampling the multiple vacua with shallow barriers by quantum fluctuations during inflation may populate domain walls that may affect the subsequent evolution of the universe  @xcite .",
    "all of these , though still speculative , may leave important observable signatures of the string landscape .    in light of this , we reexamine the dynamics of a de sitter bubble in a background de sitter spacetime .",
    "the bubble is assumed as spherically symmetric and separated from the background by a thin shell",
    ". then we use israel s thin shell formalism  @xcite to glue the bubble to the background , as was done in refs .  @xcite .",
    "although most of the global structure of the spacetime has been categorized , the parameter space that we are interested here has not been fully explored .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ shell ] , we review israel s thin shell formalism . in sec .",
    "[ junction ] , we derive the equation that governs the motion of the shell and show that in general the shell has peculiar velocity .",
    "in addition , we briefly review the maximally extended coordinate systems of the de sitter spacetime and the schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime .",
    "the evolution of the bubble is discussed in sec .  [ bubble ] and",
    "the numerical results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ numer ] .",
    "section  [ conc ] is the conclusion .",
    "here we follow the sign convention and definitions in ref .  @xcite .",
    "to describe the behavior of the shell which divides the spacetime into two regions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , it is simplest to introduce a gaussian normal coordinate system in the neighborhood of the shell .",
    "if we denote by @xmath2 the timelike ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime hypersurface in which the shell lies , we can introduce ( 2 + 1)-dimensional coordinates @xmath3 on @xmath2 , where @xmath4 runs from @xmath5 to @xmath6 . here @xmath7 is the proper - time variable that would be measured by an observer comoving with the shell . in the gaussian normal coordinate system , a geodesic in a neighborhood of @xmath2 which is orthogonal to @xmath2",
    "is taken as the third spatial coordinate denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the full set of coordinates is given by @xmath9 .",
    "we can take @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the case of a spherically symmetric shell .",
    "then the metric can be written as @xmath12 we introduce an unit vector field @xmath13 which is normal to @xmath8 = const .  hypersurfaces and pointing from @xmath1 to @xmath0 .",
    "the induced metric on the hypersurface @xmath2 can then be written as @xmath14 in the gaussian normal coordinates , @xmath15    the gaussian normal coordinate system is suitable for the gauss - codazzi formalism  @xcite in the neighborhood of @xmath2 with the coordinate @xmath8 orthogonal to the slices near @xmath2 .",
    "the extrinsic curvature is defined by @xmath16 or equivalently @xmath17 it is evident that @xmath18 is a symmetric three - tensor .",
    "the einstein equations are @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the ricci tensor , @xmath21 is the ricci scalar , and @xmath22 is the matter energy - momentum tensor . in addition , the energy - momentum conservation law implies @xmath23 where the semicolon represents the four - dimensional covariant derivative .",
    "assuming that the energy - momentum tensor only has @xmath24-function singularity on the shell , one can rewrite it in terms of gaussian normal coordinates as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the surface stress - energy tensor of the shell . adopting the thin shell formalism  @xcite , we can rewrite the einstein equations and the energy - momentum conservation law as @xmath27 = - 8\\pi g ( { s_j}^i - { 1 \\over 2 } { \\delta}_j^i s)~ , \\label{jun}\\ ] ] @xmath28=0~,\\ ] ] and @xmath29=0~,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 = { a}^+ - { a}^-$ ] for any quantity @xmath32 , and a subscript vertical bar demotes the three - dimensional covariant derivative .    by the symmetry analysis and the energy - momentum conservation law  @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the four - velocity of the shell in the gaussian normal coordinates . here",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are the surface energy density and the surface tension of the shell , respectively . in the case of a spherically symmetric shell",
    ", the induced metric on the shell can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the proper circumferential radius of the shell .",
    "( [ s ] ) then reduces to @xmath39 where the overdot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath40 . using the thin - shell approximation and the underlying field - theoretical dynamics of the scalar field which comprises the shell  @xcite , one can show that @xmath41 . from eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) , it follows that @xmath42 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ ems ] ) reduces to @xmath43 where @xmath35 is a constant independent of @xmath40 . by combining eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ ems2 ] ) , one finds @xmath44",
    "for the system under consideration , we have @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the cosmological constants of the shell interior and exterior , respectively . for convenience , we will consider positive values for both @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the following . at the end",
    ", we will extend the results for negative @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "> from birkhoff theorem , we can easily write down the most general @xmath48-symmetric solutions to the einstein equations for a region of spacetime with a non - vanishing cosmological constant . they are the de sitter  ( ds ) and schwarzschild - de sitter  ( sds ) spacetimes .",

    "the proper - time rate of change of @xmath70 is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is now given as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "compared with eq .",
    "( [ eom : r ] ) , we find that in general @xmath75 , i.e. , the shell can not be evolving with a fixed comoving scale .",

    "hence , the necessary condition for a shell moving with a fixed comoving scale is @xmath82 this means that the surface energy density of the shell has to compensate the difference of the vacuum energy densities across the shell .",
    "moreover , the shell can not be comoving with respect to both observers simultaneously .",
    "note that if @xmath83 , the shell will become null .    before solving the evolution of the bubble",

    "firstly , there is a sign ambiguity in the expression of the extrinsic curvature  ( [ beta : ds ] ) and in eq .",
    "( [ beta : sds ] ) as well .",
    "moreover , in the static coordinate system , there exist coordinate singularities at the event horizon , which are indeed caused by a poor choice of coordinates .",
