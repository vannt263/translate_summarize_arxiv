    "in the last years the possibility to have magnetic order in different kinds of solids above room temperature without nominally magnetic ions , like the usual transition or rare earth elements , has attracted the attention of the solid state community .",
    "although some theoretical and experimental works in the past provided some hints for the existence of this apparently unusual phenomenon , it has been only recently that we became aware that different kinds of defects , like vacancies , hydrogen or a combination of those with nominally non - magnetic elements can trigger magnetic order in solids @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon , named defect - induced magnetism ( dim ) , has been mostly studied , theoretically and experimentally , in the single element graphite / graphene .",
    "more than ten years ago , systematic studies of the magnetic properties of different graphite samples with different magnetic impurity concentrations suggested that an extra magnetic contribution , other than from impurities , should exist @xcite",
    ". in general , the small ferromagnetic moment observed in commercial , as - received highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) samples makes the detailed knowledge of the contribution from magnetic impurities imperative to understand its origin . in this work ,",
    "we have studied hopg samples with different grades from three different commercial sources , i.e. a total of nine hopg samples .",
    "this study , therefore , gives a fairly reproducible spectrum on the different magnetic contributions in the hopg samples available nowadays .",
    "an accurate measurement of impurity concentrations in the ppm range and in micrometer small grains is not simple and only possible with an experimental method which provides elemental imaging with excellent detection limits in the ppm and sub - ppm range together with reliable quantification , preferably in a non - destructive way .",
    "the method used in this work , particle induced x - ray emission ( pixe ) , has the necessary requirements for this kind of studies . in this work ,",
    "we show that a large contamination with magnetic elements is found at the sidefaces of as - received hopg samples , very probably originating from the cutting of the sample prior shipping .",
    "the observed amount of the sideface impurities can overwhelm by far the usually observed impurity concentration in the bulk and , if no thorough sample cleaning is done , clearly prevents the measurement of the magnetic contribution from dim in pristine hopg samples .",
    "on the other hand , the sole measurement of the magnetic moment of a sample with a known amount of impurities does not provide always with a clear statement , whether the ferromagnetism is or is not due to impurities @xcite . in general and for small impurity concentration and grains @xcite ,",
    "only an upper estimate of the ferromagnetic signal from those grains can be simply done .",
    "this is due to the fact that not only the grain size , but also the , in general difficult to quantify , stoichiometry and structure of the existing ferromagnetic phases determine the magnetic signal .",
    "therefore , demonstrated for the case of graphite , we will show in this work that together with a careful impurity measurement , the temperature dependence of the remanent magnetic moment helps to discern , which magnetic contributions are active in the sample .",
    "the manuscript is divided in three more sections and a conclusion . in the next section  [ exp ]",
    "we provide details on sample preparation , the used elemental analysis methods and the commercial superconducting quantum interferometer device ( squid ) used for magnetometry . taking into account the",
    ", in general , limited knowledge on the possibilities of pixe in contrast to usual methods for elemental analysis like scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive x - ray analysis ( sem / edx ) @xcite , the manuscript includes a complete trace element analysis obtained with pixe in section [ te ] and a comparison with the results obtained with edx analysis in section  [ c - edx ] .",
    "section [ sf ] discusses the impurity distribution at the sidefaces of the commercial hopg , a fact that we believe is of importance for any future discussion on the `` intrinsic '' bulk impurity concentration presented in section  [ bc ] .",
    "an elemental analysis of single metallic grains found in hopg samples is given in section  [ pixegrains ] . in section  [ mp ]",
    "we present and discuss the magnetic characterization done with the squid in all hopg samples and compare it with the information obtained from the elemental analysis .",

    "the samples studied are commercially available hopg from advanced ceramics ( now momentive performance materials ) , nt - mdt and spi supplies @xcite . from each of these companies ,",
    "samples were purchased in the three available structural grades designated as zya , zyb and zyh . in case of spi supplies the corresponding designation is spi-1 , -2 and -3 . in the following ,",
    "the samples are named by the company ( advanced ceramics is abbreviated as ac ) and the structural grade , e.g. ac zya denotes the zya - grade sample from advanced ceramics .",
    "the hopg samples were wire - cut into pieces of @xmath3  mm@xmath4 size each and thoroughly cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with ethanol for squid magnetometry .",
    "on one piece of zya - grade hopg from each company trace elemental analysis was performed in the as - received state , i.e. without sample cleaning to check for possible contaminations , especially at the sidefaces . for this purpose",
    ", the samples were only cleaved with a cube - knive and glued on si substrates using varnish with the cleaved surface on top . in order to characterize the `` intrinsic '' bulk trace element content using pixe and sem / edx analysis ,",
    "the samples were additionally cleaned three times with ethanol in an ultrasonic bath , glued on si substrates using varnish and the top surface removed by tape stripping to prepare a fresh one onto which the ion / electron beam was directed .",
    "trace elemental analysis of the samples was performed at the lipsion facility of the university of leipzig @xcite with pixe @xcite and rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( rbs ) @xcite using a 2.28  mev proton microbeam focused to @xmath5  @xmath6 m diameter .",
    "the proton microbeam was raster - scanned across the sample surface and the characteristic x - rays and backscattered protons simultaneously recorded for each scan pixel . in this way ,",

    "whereas pixe provides excellent sensitivity , but no direct depth profiling capabilities , rbs inherently allows depth profiling of element concentrations if they are sufficiently high . as will be shown later , rbs can be used to determine the thickness of metallic particles and their location below the surface in a non - destructive way , i.e. without the need to prepare cross - sections from the sample for edx or tem analysis . furthermore",

    "afterwards , the spectra were analyzed using xrump @xcite .",
    "for comparison with previously published studies @xcite and ion beam microscopy selected samples were further analyzed with sem and edx using the dual beam microscope nova nanolab 200 from fei company .",
    "prior elemental analysis of single metallic particles , backscattered electron ( be ) imaging was used to locate them due to the @xmath10-contrast between the carbon bulk and the heavier 3d - elements of the grains .",

    "the quantitative analysis of this contamination reveals a composition of 16.0% cr , 77.2% fe and 6.8% ni by weight which fits with the frequently used non - magnetic , austenitic sae grade 301 stainless steel @xcite .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that this contamination originates from the cutting of the samples prior shipping using a stainless steel tool .",

    "grains fe is present too .",
    "however , there are a few ( ti , v ) grains that do not contain fe and a few fe grains that do not contain ti or v. the maps indicate that the grain density is significantly higher in spi-3 and that the grains itself are slightly smaller compared to ac zya . assuming that grains can be detected up to a depth of 27  @xmath6 m ( see section  [ pixeexp ] ) their density in ac zya can be estimated to about @xmath64  @xmath65 .",
    "it should be noted that using be and edx imaging in @xcite no grains were detected in spi-3 at all , probably due to their small size and the inferior sensitivity of the methods used .",
    "consequently , the sample was assumed to be free of fe contamination @xcite , in clear contrast to our findings , see tab .",

    "[ zya_ac_c ] from the same sample , whereas the fe and ni concentrations are both twice as large as for pixe .",
    "this might be due to differences in the composition of individual grains as pointed out earlier and/or due to the rather poor statistics in the edx spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ edx_ac_zya](b ) ) and the insufficient knowledge of grain thickness and depth .",
    "assuming that the metallic content of single grains can be accurately determined with edx , bulk concentrations can in principle be estimated from these data as was done in @xcite .",
    "this approach , however , has several weaknesses : ( i ) it requires that all the grains in a sample are comparable in metallic content and composition which is not necessarily the case as fig .",
    "[ pixe_grains ] shows ; ( ii ) the number density of grains must be determined , e.g. using be imaging . since",
    "only a very low number of grains is present in hopg in the near - surface area of @xmath78  @xmath6 m depth even for large scan areas ( in @xcite only three grains are visible for ac zya in a @xmath79 scan area ! ) substantial statistical errors exist ; ( iii ) trace elements not enriched in grains are not taken into account at all .",
    "these difficulties lead us to the conclusion that edx is useful for identifying and imaging metallic grains in hopg , but can not be considered as a reliable method for quantitative trace element analysis in graphite , in contrast to truly bulk - sensitive techniques as e.g. pixe / rbs or inaa .",
    "indeed , the fe concentration in ac zya was estimated from sem analysis ( and magnetization data ) to 6",
    "@xmath6g / g in @xcite , whereas pixe analysis always gave @xmath80  @xmath6g / g fe for numerous of ac zya samples in the last ten years .",
    "this discrepancy might be due to the grain density which is stated to be about 0.25 per @xmath81 volume , i.e. @xmath82  @xmath65 for ac zya @xcite , about a factor eight higher than our estimations and what can be judged from the be image in @xcite itself .",
    "as explained in the introduction , one of the aims of this work is to correlate the magnetization behavior of the hopg samples with the one we can estimate taking into account the impurity concentration obtained by pixe",
    ". in general , information on the impurity concentrations is mandatory in order to understand the origin of any unusual magnetic behavior of nominally non - magnetic samples .",
    "however , as we will point out below , the concentration values alone are not sufficient to predict the behavior of the magnetization , just because the magnetic impurities in a graphite matrix can show different magnetic response upon several details , like their magnetic state ( composition ) and grain size . as an example",
    ", we note that fe in graphite not always shows a ferromagnetic behavior @xcite : a sample with an inhomogeneous fe concentration of up to 0.38% ( in weight ) shows no magnetic order .",
    "if we implant single fe atoms randomly distributed in a disordered graphite lattice one does not expect magnetic order , as confirmed after implanting fe up to concentrations of @xmath83g / g @xcite .    for the characterization of the magnetic behavior of the hopg samples we measured the field and temperature hysteresis of the magnetic moment .",
    "in order to compare different samples with different masses , the magnetization values given in this study are always normalized to the whole sample mass . figure  [ hhys ]    emu / gt has been subtracted in all the three samples .",

    ", this background is relatively small and the ferromagnetic hysteresis is clearly recognized even without subtraction in most of the samples . from these hysteresis curves",
    "we obtain the magnetization values at saturation @xmath86 t ) at different temperatures and the remanence , i.e. @xmath87 t ) after sweeping the field back from @xmath88 t . for all samples we measured well defined field hysteresis loops with weak temperature dependence .",
    "the magnetization values at saturation and at remanence at two temperatures as well as the fe concentration are shown in fig .  [ vsgrade ] for the individual sample grades .",
    "this figure reveals the following interesting details : ( i ) a very low fe concentration below 1  ppm is found always for hopg samples of zya grade ( note that 10  @xmath6g / g fe in graphite means about 2.1  ppm of fe ) with exception of ac samples where the lowest fe concentration is found for the zyb - grade sample and the sample with the highest fe concentration ( @xmath89ppm ) is ac zyh ; ( ii ) at first glance , the magnetization data ( figs .  [ vsgrade](a ) and ( b ) ) follow roughly the same trend as the fe concentration .",
    "however , as we discuss below , a quantitative comparison of the magnetization values with the expected values from the measured fe concentration added to the temperature dependence of the remanence indicate that the measured ferromagnetic response in some of the samples can not be simply due to impurities .",

    "emu / g ) and for sample ac zya @xmath96emu / g ( @xmath97  emu / g ) , i.e. a ratio of @xmath98 between the two samples .",

    "this apparent correlation is less clear for other samples of different origin .",
    "for example , for the samples nt - mdt zyh and nt - mdt zya the ratio between magnetization at saturation at 5  k is @xmath100 , see fig .",
    "[ corr ] , a ratio that does not agree with the expected ratio of 19 if _ all _ fe would contribute to the ferromagnetic signal .",
    "furthermore , if we compare samples with similar fe concentration but of different origins , i.e. the three samples with expected fe magnetization around @xmath101emu / g or the three around @xmath102emu / g ( see full symbols in fig .",
    "[ corr ] ) , we recognize also that a large variation of the measured magnetization for similar fe concentrations exists . a fact that should be not surprising since in general fe is not homogeneously distributed in the micron - sized impurity grains as revealed by pixe elemental imaging ( see section  [ pixegrains ] ) and shown in @xcite for an ac zya sample .",
    "it is rather unlikely that it would provide the expected maximum magnetic moment at saturation for fe , fe@xmath0o@xmath90 or fe@xmath0c .",
    "in fact , the saturation magnetization for the nt - mdt zya sample , where no local fe enrichment in the form of grains was found , is 2.3 or even 3.6 times larger than the highest expected saturation magnetization from fe or fe@xmath0c , respectively .",
    "even more , taking into account that fe is most likely present in the form of fe@xmath0c , only the saturation magnetizations of the ac zya , spi-1 and spi-3 samples are still compatible with the observed impurity content , whereas the majority of samples shows magnetization values clearly above the possible contribution from all found magnetic impurities ( note that apart from fe , the maximum possible contribution of all other magnetic elements remains negligible , in comparison ) .",
    "we note that in @xcite it was stated that no ferromagnetic signal and no impurity grains were found for spi-2 and -3 in contrast to our findings .",
    "furthermore , a large variation in saturation magnetization was reported between different nt - mdt zyb and zyh samples , again in contrast to our findings were the @xmath103 values as well as the fe contents are nearly identical for both samples ( see fig .",
    "[ vsgrade ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the nt - mdt zya sample showed the highest saturation magnetization among all samples in @xcite , despite having a fe concentration about a factor 20 lower than the other samples  according to our trace element analysis .",
    "one may tend to explain this clear deviation with strong variations in the impurity content between different batches of nt - mdt ( and spi samples as well ) .",
    "this , however , and from our experience with the hopg samples from advanced ceramics , seems unlikely .",
    "it might , therefore , also indicate that no simple correlation exists between impurity content and magnetic properties  as shown in this study .    in @xcite",
    "the saturation magnetization of the spi-2 sample is about twice as large and the fe content measured with inaa almost a factor three higher than for our sample .",
    "since inaa is a suitable method for trace element analysis , the deviations between both findings might give an indication on the extent of variation between different batches of spi-2 samples .",
    "however , since no information was given in @xcite on sample cleaning and due to the lack of imaging capabilities in inaa analysis , it can not be excluded that contaminations like the sideface contamination shown in fig .",
    "[ sideface](a ) have been overseen in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , assuming that fe is present as fe@xmath0c in line with their own findings , the saturation magnetization is about 35% larger than expected from the fe concentration .",
    "more surprisingly , the saturation magnetization of the ac zya sample was found to be about a factor eight larger than in our study . from this value venkatesan",
    "estimated the fe concentration in ac zya to be 6  @xmath6g / g @xcite , a value that clearly contradicts our measurements as discussed above .",
    "whatever the contributions to this large magnetization are , it is far above the value that can be attributed to the impurity content inside the hopg bulk itself .    from our findings presented above we conclude that in some of the hopg samples , specially in those with low enough fe concentration , an extra mechanism contributes to the observed magnetic order .",
    "this conclusion is similar to that obtained in @xcite . as noted in the introduction , further support to this conclusion",
    "is obtained by the temperature dependence of the remanent magnetization discussed in the next section .      as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite one way to discern whether the expected ferromagnetic contribution of fe impurities is at work in the samples , is to measure the temperature dependence of the magnetization at remanence .",
    "as shown in @xcite , to compare quantitatively the @xmath2-dependence of the ferromagnetic signal with appropriate models we need to avoid arbitrary background subtractions . therefore , an appropriate choice is to compare the remanent magnetization measured at zero applied field .",
    "we expect at most three different mechanisms that can contribute to the remanence and influence its temperature dependence , namely : ( i ) for large enough 3d ferromagnetic fe particles we expect to see a @xmath2-dependence of the remanent magnetization given by the excitation of spin waves following the usual 3d bloch @xmath1 model . according to this model the temperature dependence of the magnetization for excitation of bulk spin waves follows a law of the type @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is a constant proportional to the spin wave stiffness .",
    "this simple law applies only at @xmath106 ( @xmath107 is the curie temperature of the material ) . at higher temperatures a correction that takes into account @xmath107 has to be applied @xcite",
    "this temperature dependence in the remanent magnetization has been indeed observed for a hopg sample with large enough fe impurities as ac zyh @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) for samples with a weaker 3d ferromagnetic contribution , however , a quasi - linear temperature dependence for the remanent magnetization has been observed @xcite .",
    "this dependence can be understood within the 2d heisenberg anisotropic spin wave model . we note",
    "that this mechanism , first observed in proton irradiated hopg samples @xcite ( see also @xcite ) suggests that defects , whatever their origin , within the graphene planes are responsible for triggering the observed magnetic order .",
    "the quasi - linear temperature dependence is an indication of excitation of 2d spin waves that reduce the magnetization linearly with @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the 2d spin - waves magnetization follows as @xmath108 obtained using perturbation theory techniques up to third order in spin waves @xcite ; @xmath109 is the magnetization due to spin waves and @xmath110 is due to an ising model with the exchange renormalized by the spin waves , for more details see @xcite and references therein .",
    "\\(iii ) superparamagnetism is a possible third mechanism that can affect the temperature dependence of the remanent magnetization . according to @xcite it follows a simple @xmath111 dependence that can be added to the temperature dependence due to the other contributions .",
    "this contribution that has its origin in small enough ferromagnetic clusters , is expected to contribute mainly at low enough temperatures .    as an example of the different contributions we show in fig .",

    "figure  [ thys](b ) and its inset show the calculated curves ; one can clearly realize , especially at low temperatures that the data do not follow the 2d anisotropic heisenberg spin wave model but the 3d bloch @xmath1 model . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of the remanent magnetization of sample nt - mdt zyh is compatible with the 2d anisotropic heisenberg spin wave model , see fig .",

    "[ vsgrade ] may leave a skeptical reader with the feeling that all the magnetic signal is due to impurities .",
    "we note , however , that in the way the hopg samples are produced @xcite , there should be a correlation between defect concentration ( as well as hydrogen or other non - magnetic impurities ) and the magnetic impurity concentration .",
    "the hopg samples with less fe impurity , grade zya , are obtained at larger annealing temperatures than those with grade zyb or zyh .",
    "therefore , it should be not surprising that both possible origins , one from fe and the other from dim , are correlated . independently done studies of the change of the magnetic signals with low - temperature annealing ( in comparison with the production temperature of the hopg samples used ) supports the existence of a dim contribution in hopg samples of high grade and low impurity concentration @xcite .",
    "in this work we have done a complete trace element analysis using pixe and rbs in different hopg samples of different sources .",
    "the main impurity that can contribute to the magnetic response of the samples is fe , showing a maximum concentration of @xmath126g / g for zyh grade samples .",
    "the contamination at the sidefaces of as - received hopg samples is notable and can exceed the one in the sample bulk .",

    "the analysis of single metallic grains indicates that they are not spherical but quasi flat disks oriented parallel to the graphene planes , in agreement with previous reports .",
    "the size and composition of the grains differ substantially between different hopg samples but also within the same sample .",
    "we have studied the elemental distribution of some of the samples with edx in order to compare its capabilities and limitations with those of ion beam analysis .",
    "our results clearly show that edx can not be used to measure bulk concentrations of trace elements in hopg with such a small impurity concentration directly but only and , to a certain extent , in single grains .",
    "moreover , our comparative studies indicate that edx can not be considered a reliable method for quantitative trace element analysis in graphite , clarifying several weaknesses and discrepancies in the element concentration estimates done in the literature .    from the field and temperature hysteresis of the magnetic moment of the hopg samples we conclude that in some of the samples an extra contribution , other than those from magnetic impurities , to the observed ferromagnetic magnetization response exists .",
    "in agreement with previous reports this extra contribution is compatible with quasi two - dimensional defect - induced magnetism .",
    "the rough correspondence between the magnetization at saturation and the total fe concentration indicates also that defect density and the impurity concentration can be correlated .",
    "no general answer , however , can be given even knowing the nominally magnetic impurity concentration , to the question whether magnetic impurities are or are not the reason for the observed magnetic response in a given hopg sample .",
