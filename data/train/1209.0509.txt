    "proposed in 1975 , by takahashi and umezawa@xcite , thermofield dynamics ( tfd ) is an operator - algebraic approach to quantum statistical mechanics and a real time formalism to finite temperature quantum field theory@xcite .",
    "the basic ingredients of tfd are the doubling of freedom degrees in the hilbert space @xmath0 which describes the physical system and the building of a finite temperature vacuum , thermofield vacuum , by means of a bogoliubov transformation realized in the zero temperature vacuum state defined into the hilbert space @xmath1 , also called liouville space @xcite .",
    "this procedure is made in such a way that the expectation value of any operator from @xmath0 in the thermofield vacuum coincides with the statistical mean value .",
    "tfd has been largely applied in the study of finite temperature systems , high energy physics @xcite , quantum optics @xcite , condensed matter physics @xcite , among others@xcite .",
    "here we consider a process where the input state is a bosonic thermofield vacuum .",
    "this state will be lead to a parametric down conversion interaction generating photon excitations as output states .",
    "in general , this process is described by a way where the input state suffering the parametric down conversion is completelly annihilated generating as output correlated photons with number operator expectation values equal to 1 , where the output states were initially vacuum state .    indeed , parametric down conversion is a non - linear process in the light of quantizing electromagnetic field where a single photon incides on a crystal with second order non - linearity generating in the interaction two photons with resulting frequencies equal to the sum of the input frequency .",
    "the output frequencies are called generally signal and idler , the frequency of the input photon is called generally pump frequency @xcite .    in the process that we will describe ,",
    "our aim is to obtain as output states one - photon number excitations , considering the distribution of the photon number operator . following a tfd scheme where the system evolves under a liouville - von neumann equation , the input state ,",
    "initially in a bosonic thermofield vacuum , and the output states , initially in vacuum states , are changed under the parametric down conversion leading the output states one - photon excitations whose caracterizations is described by the mean expectation value of their number operators .",
    "in fact , thermofield dynamics have been used for studying parametric amplification @xcite and degenerate parametric amplification with dissipation @xcite .",
    "this last can treat the case where the bosonic thermofield vacuum evolves under dissipation , such that part of the hamiltonian is non - hermitean .    in our propose ,",
    "a parametric down conversion of a bosonic thermofield vacuum is considered using equilibrium states , such that the liouville - von neumann operator can be used in an hermitean form .",
    "giving an operator @xmath2 acting on a hilbert space @xmath0 generated by fock states @xmath3 , its expectation value in a given ensemble is expressed by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the density operator in the corresponding ensemble . in thermofield dynamics this expectation value is evaluated by means of the definition of a thermofield vacuum @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , leading to the same result as statistical approach , i.e. , @xmath8 as a consequence , the thermal vaccuum state @xmath9 is associated to the density operator @xmath5 .",
    "for this reason we need to describe it in a hilbert space larger than the hilbert space @xmath0 generated by the fock states @xmath3 .",
    "then , the thermofield vacuum @xmath9 is not a vector state in the hilbert space @xmath0 described by the fock states @xmath3 , but a state in another enlarged hilbert space @xmath1 , where @xmath10 is the hilbert space conjugated to @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , in order to describe @xmath11 as a vector state , we need to double the degrees of freedom of the hilbert space @xmath0 by a formal procedure named tilde conjugation @xcite , creating the space @xmath1 .",
    "consider the system described by a thermal equilibrium density matrix @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the partition function and the energy spectrum @xmath14 of the hamiltonian @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 .",
    "we construct the thermofield vacuum in the space @xmath1 , in terms of the fock state basis @xmath3 and unknown vectors @xmath17 , by means of the following expansion @xmath18 in order to find the vectors @xmath19 , we can use the equation ( [ med ] ) , where the operator @xmath2 does not act on @xmath20 vectors , @xmath21 on the other hand , we can write @xmath22 comparing equations ( [ rodado ] ) and ( [ somado ] ) , we find @xmath23 thus , by defining the fock states @xmath24 a basis product can be given to @xmath1 and we can write @xmath20 vectors as @xmath25 now , we can write the thermofield vacuum in terms of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and the thermofield vacuum can be annihilated @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an unitary operator mixing @xmath30 and @xmath24 by acting on the hilbert space @xmath1 , as a two - mode squeezing operator , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a parameter related to a thermal distribution , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are creation operators acting on spaces @xmath0 and @xmath10 , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are annihilation operators acting on spaces @xmath0 and @xmath10 , respectively . in the case of a bosonic oscillator system",
    ", we have @xmath37 , related to a bose - einsten statistics , and for a fermionic oscillator system we have @xmath38 , related to a fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "the term @xmath39 is a bogoliubov transformation . since the bogoliubov transformation is canonical ,",
    "the corresponding commutations for bosons or anticommutations for fermions are preserved .",
    "the operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 , given by equations ( [ lyiul1 ] ) and ( [ lyiul3 ] ) , excite the thermofield vacuum generating excited thermofield states .    in the liouville space @xmath1 given by tfd",
    ", the zero temperature vacuum state is given by @xmath42 , associated to a density operator at zero temperature @xmath43 . by applying a bogoliubov transformation @xmath39 on this vacuum state @xmath44 ,",
    "the thermofield vacuum is generated at a finite temperature @xmath45 , @xmath46    in tfd , tilde conjugation rules realize a mapping between @xmath2 operators acting on @xmath3 and @xmath47 acting on @xmath48 . these rules are summarized by @xmath49_{\\pm}&=&0 , \\label{pm2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the operators @xmath2 and @xmath50 act only in the hilbert space spanned by @xmath3 , and @xmath47 and @xmath51 act only in the hilbert space generated by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are complex numbers , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are their respective complex conjugated . in equation ( [ pm ] ) , @xmath57 is for bosons and @xmath58 is for fermions @xcite . in equation ( [ pm2 ] )",
    "@xmath57 means commutation for bosons and @xmath58 is anticommutation for fermions .    in the case of a fermionic oscillator ,",
    "the space @xmath1 is generated from the zero temperature vacuum and its excitations , latexmath:[\\ ] ] if we project the side @xmath106 in the state @xmath121 , we have @xmath122 this implies that this state has no parts in the vacuum and then can not be projected into it .",
    "the states have evolved such that the projection into the one - photon excitations will lead @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 these projections means that all the possible measured values in @xmath106 will lead to states of one - photon excited states in @xmath110 and @xmath111 , and these states are completelly separable in the space @xmath1 .",
    "this result is better to explain the previous one ( [ ufall ] ) .",
    "in fact , the projections @xmath127 and @xmath128 consequently , in the approximation considered the parametric down conversion of thermofield vacuum will lead to only excitations of one - photon states .",
    "once specified the state of a fock state @xmath1 in @xmath106 , the states in @xmath110 and @xmath111 are specified as excitations of one photon states in @xmath1 and are not entangled in the space @xmath1 .",
    "it follows that a set of measurements of the residual state in the fock basis of @xmath1 will determine clearly the excitations of one - photon distributions in the sides @xmath106 and @xmath110 .",
    "we have considered a parametric down conversion where the input state is given by a thermofield bosonic vacuum state on a side @xmath106 , related to a bose - einstein distribution . turning on the interaction until time of interaction and the coupling constant satisfy @xmath129 and taking into account a small coupling term @xmath95",
    ", we arrive at the result where the output states on sides @xmath110 and @xmath111 , initially on vacuum states , are excited in one - photon states , leading to number operator expectation values of one photon number in each side , @xmath110 and @xmath111 .    on the other hand",
    ", the thermofield bosonic vacuum state is not totally annihilated in the process , resulting in a residual state whose profile of the number operator expectation value is different from a bose - einstein distribution , due to losing of photons in the interaction .",
    "we shown that a specific measurements on the fock state of the space @xmath1 will lead to a specification of one - photon states distributions in the sides @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "such ideas can also be of relevance on the experimental side @xcite , where thermofield or thermal like states are involved .",
