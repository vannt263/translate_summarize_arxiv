    "the inflationary scenario  @xcite , in which the present universe is only a small local patch of a causally connected region at early times which underwent an exponential expansion driven by the inflaton potential , is generally accepted for explaining the observed spatially flat and homogeneous universe . in addition , its quantum fluctuations during inflation give rise to primordial gaussian matter density fluctuations with a nearly scale - invariant power spectrum , which is consistent with recent astrophysical and cosmological observations such as structure formation and cosmic microwave background anisotropies  @xcite .",
    "although the simplest single - field , slow - roll inflation model works well , some basic questions have yet to be answered . what is the origin of the inflaton potential ?",
    "do classical matter density imhomogenities that we observe today genuinely come from quantum fluctuations of the inflaton ?",
    "are the observed matter density fluctuations truly gaussian ?",
    "how robust are the predictions for a subdominant contribution of tensor modes to the metric fluctuations , a slightly broken scale invariance , and a negligible running spectral index of the power spectrum ?",
    "future cosmic microwave background measurements and mega - scale mappings of the large scale structure will definitely answer some of these questions or perhaps pose a challenge to the standard inflation scenario .",
    "there has been a lot of studies on inflationary models that go beyond the simplest single - field , slow - roll inflation .",
    "a class of models has considered a new source for generating inflaton fluctuations during inflation through a yukawa - type or gravitational interaction between the inflaton and other quantum fields .",
    "this leads to very interesting results such as the so - called warm inflation  @xcite , the suppression of large - scale density fluctuations  @xcite , the bursts of particle production via the infra - red cascading mechanism  @xcite , the trapped inflation in which the inflaton rolls slowly down a steep potential by dumping its kinetic energy into particle production  @xcite , and possible constraints on the duration of inflationary expansion  @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors analyzed a model in which the inflaton @xmath0 couples to another scalar field @xmath1 via the interaction , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a coupling constant and @xmath4 is a constant field value .",
    "when @xmath0 rolls down to @xmath4 , the @xmath1 particles become instantaneously massless and are produced with a number density that increases with @xmath0 s velocity . as @xmath0 dumps its kinetic energy into the @xmath1 particles , it is slowed down and the produced @xmath1 particles are diluted due to the inflationary expansion . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , a viable inflationary model ( the so - called trapped inflation ) can be achieved by assuming sufficiently closely spaced trapping points like @xmath4 along the @xmath0 trajectory even on a potential which is too steep for slow - roll inflation . in their approach , the backreaction of the @xmath1 particle production to the inflaton field and the associated effect of particle number density fluctuations in the process of particle production are simply introduced in the equation of motion for @xmath0 by use of the mean field approximation : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the inflaton potential and we will go back to this equation later on .    in this paper , we will develop a lagrangian approach based on the influence functional method in which the @xmath1 field is integrated out .",
    "this will enable us to derive self - consistently the equation of motion for the @xmath0 field that incorporates the backreaction of the @xmath1 particle production and the particle number density fluctuations in the particle production .",
    "we will find that the particle number density fluctuations should be replaced by a colored noise term .",
    "in addition , there exists a new dissipative effect that is closely related to the noise .",
    "in fact , this dissipation is well - known in the real - time approach to non - equilibrium phenomena in quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ifm ] , the influence functional method is introduced and the langevin equation for the inflaton field is derived . in sec .",
    "[ trapsec ] , we will calculate the power spectrum of the inflaton fluctuations driven by the noise term in the weak coupling limit .",
    "also , we will consider the effect of multiple trapping points on inflaton fluctuations .",
    "the dissipation is discussed in sec .",
    "[ dissipation ] and we conclude in sec .  [ con ] .",
    "we will adopt the influence functional method  @xcite to take into account the effects of the quantum fluctuations of the @xmath1 field on the inflaton dynamics in a real - time manner , different from using a one - loop effective potential as usually found for example in ref .",
    "thus , the effective langevin equation of the inflaton is obtained , describing the time - dependent corrections to the inflaton equation of motion originally given by the classical inflaton potential . in particular , this langevin equation , which goes beyond the mean field approximation , involves a stochastic noise term that drives the growth of perturbation of the inflaton as we will see in the following .",
    "let us consider a slow - rolling inflaton @xmath0 coupled to a massless scalar field @xmath1 with an interaction given in eq.([interact ] ) .",
    "then , the total lagrangian is given by @xmath7 where @xmath6 is the inflaton potential that complies with the slow - roll conditions .",
    "to simplify matter , we make a shift : @xmath8 .",
    "hence , the lagrangian becomes @xmath9 where the trapping point is located at @xmath10 .",
    "we can approximate the space - time during inflation by a de sitter metric given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the conformal time and @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the hubble parameter .",
    "here we rescale @xmath15 at the initial time of the inflation era , @xmath16 .    to proceed ,",
    "let us assume that the initial density matrix at time @xmath17 can be factorized as @xmath18 the full density matrix evolves unitarily and the evolution can be described by employing the closed - time - path formalism .",

    "@xcite , a model that has the lagrangian  ( [ model ] ) plus a mass term @xmath170 for the @xmath1 field was considered .",
    "it was shown that including the dissipation term would only slightly affect the kinematics for slow - roll inflation as well as the noise - driven inflaton fluctuations even with @xmath171 . in this paper , we have considered a weak coupling constant with @xmath172 .",
    "although the @xmath1 field is massless here , the results for the noise - driven inflaton fluctuations are similar to those in ref .  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that the dissipation term can be safely omitted",
    ". however , for strong couplings with @xmath145 , such as those considered in the study of particle bursts  @xcite and in the trapped inflation  @xcite , the dissipation term may be in competition with the noise term .",
    "if so , one would need to solve the full langevin equation  ( [ lange ] ) to re - examine the inflation dynamics and the inflaton fluctuations .",
    "we have developed a lagrangian approach based on the influence functional method to investigate the effects of trapping on inflation .",
    "the langevin equation for inflaton thus derived in eq .",
    "( [ lange ] ) is compared to the equation of motion used in refs .",
    "the multiplicative colored noise in the langevin equation is indeed the particle number density fluctuations studied by the authors in refs .",
    "@xcite ; however , they have not considered the dissipation term .",
    "the langevin equation has been solved in the weak coupling regime with @xmath172 , in which the dissipation can be ignored .",
    "we have calculated the power spectrum of the noise - driven inflaton fluctuations for a single trapping point and studied its variation with the location of the trapping point along the inflaton trajectory .",
    "we have found that if the inflaton rolls down the potential with closely spaced trapping points , the resulting power spectrum would be blue .",
    "this is an interesting result .",
    "however , the dissipation should begin to play a role and damp the power of the high @xmath110 modes which leave the horizon in late times .",
    "the present paper has given a systematic approach to deal with trapping points located along the inflaton trajectory .",
    "it worths re - examining the effects of trapping with a strong coupling on inflation that have been discussed in refs .  @xcite . in particular , it is interesting to study the effect of dissipation to both the backreaction and the fluctuations .",
