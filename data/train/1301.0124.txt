    "the naming game was first proposed by stells @xcite to describe the emergence of conventions and shared lexicons in a population of individuals interacting through successive conversations , but a number of variants of the model have also been introduced and studied numerically by statistical physicists , and we refer to section v.b of @xcite for a review of these different variants .",
    "the reason for the popularity of the naming game in the physics literature is that it is similar mathematically to traditional models in the field of statistical mechanics .",
    "the model studied in this paper is a biased version of the spatial naming game considered by baronchelli et al",
    "their system consists of a population of individuals located on the vertex set of a finite connected graph that has to be thought of as an interaction network .",
    "each individual is characterized by an internal inventory of words that are synonyms describing the same object .",
    "all inventories are initially empty and evolve through successive conversations : at each time step , an edge of the network is chosen uniformly at random , which causes the two individuals connected by the edge to interact .",
    "one individual is chosen at random to be the `` speaker '' making the other individual the `` hearer '' .",
    "if the speaker does not have any word to describe the object then she invents one , whereas if she already has some words then she chooses one at random to be passed to the hearer .",
    "the conversation results in the following alternative : if the hearer already has the word pronounced in her internal inventory then this word is selected as the norm by both individuals  all the other words are removed from both inventories  otherwise the hearer adds the word pronounced to her inventory .    based on numerical simulations , baronchelli et al .",
    "@xcite studied the maximum number of words present in the system as well as the time to global consensus , i.e. , the time until all inventories consist of the same single word .",
    "in contrast , we use the naming game to study whether a new word can spread into a population that is already using another word as a convention , i.e. , we assume that initially all the inventories reduce to the same single word , say word @xmath0 , except for one individual who also has another word in her inventory , say word @xmath1 . under the symmetric rules of the naming game ,",
    "the probability that @xmath1 becomes eventually the new convention tends to zero as the population size goes up to infinity so we look at biased versions of the naming game in which each word is attributed a fitness . in our model , the fitness of each word measures the fitness of each individual , that is how likely they are selected as a speaker rather than hearer , and also how likely each word is selected to be pronounced by bilingual individuals , i.e. , individuals who possess both words in their internal inventory .",
    "another significant difference between this article and previous works about the naming game is that it provides a rigorous analysis of the model on both finite and infinite graphs rather than results based on numerical simulations which are unavoidably restricted to finite graphs .",
    "also , we describe the dynamics in continuous time rather than discrete time , i.e , we assume that conversations occur at rate one along each edge of the graph , in order to have a model well defined on finite and infinite graphs .    to describe our biased version of the naming game more formally , we let @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the fitness of word @xmath1 and word @xmath0 , respectively , and set @xmath7 for all @xmath8 . note in particular that @xmath9 the average fitness @xmath10 represents the fitness of bilingual individuals .",
    "in each interaction , the individual playing the role of the speaker is chosen at random with probability her fitness divided by the overall fitness of the pair : when the neighbors are in state @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the individual chosen to be the speaker is the individual in state @xmath11 with probability @xmath13 . similarly , given that a bilingual individual is chosen as the speaker , the conditional probability that word @xmath1 is pronounced is equal to the relative fitness @xmath14 . in particular , each edge becomes active at rate one , which results in the following possible transitions for the states at the vertices connected by the edge : @xmath15 note that , when the fitnesses are equal , one recovers the transition probabilities of the unbiased naming game described above .",
    "we formulate the dynamics using two parameters to have natural notations that preserve the symmetry between both words , but we point out that the long - term behavior of the process only depends on the ratio @xmath16 .",
    "* mean - field model . *    before stating our results for the spatial stochastic model , we look at its nonspatial deterministic mean - field approximation , i.e , the model obtained by assuming that the population is well - mixing .",
    "this results in the following system of differential equations : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the frequency of type @xmath11 individuals for @xmath19 .",
    "the mean - field model has two trivial equilibria , namely @xmath20 which correspond to the configuration in which all individuals are of type @xmath1 and the configuration in which all individuals are of type @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "we say that word @xmath1 can invade word @xmath0 in the mean - field model whenever the system starting from any initial state different from @xmath21 converges to the trivial equilibrium @xmath22 .",
    "regardless of the ratio @xmath16 , the frequency of type @xmath1 individuals might decrease because the boundary @xmath23 is repelling , but looking instead at the difference between the frequency of individuals using word @xmath1 and word @xmath0 gives @xmath24 which is positive for all @xmath3 when @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this implies that there is no equilibrium other than the two trivial equilibria and that word @xmath1 can invade word @xmath0 for all @xmath3 .",
    "this condition is sharp in the sense that @xmath21 is locally stable when @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , the jacobian matrix of the system of differential equations at point @xmath21 reduces to @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a key quantity that will appear again later .",
    "the eigenspace associated with the eigenvalue zero is generated by the vector @xmath30 which is not oriented in the direction of the two - simplex containing the solution curves .",
    "the other two eigenvalues are @xmath31 which are both negative when @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , for all @xmath27 , the equilibrium @xmath21 is locally stable , therefore word @xmath1 can not invade .",
    "note that the obvious symmetry of the model also implies that both trivial equilibria are locally stable when @xmath32 .",
    "numerical simulations of the mean - field model suggest that , in this case , there is an additional nontrivial fixed point which is a saddle point , therefore the system is bistable : for almost all initial conditions , the system converges to one of the two trivial equilibria ( see figure [ fig : mean - field ] for pictures of the solution curves ) .    * spatial stochastic model .",
    "* we now look at the spatial stochastic naming game . for the stochastic process",
    ", the main objective is to study the probability that word @xmath1 invades the population and is selected as a new linguistic convention when starting with a single bilingual individual and all the other individuals of type @xmath0 .",
    "note that , for non - homogeneous graphs , this probability depends on the location of the initial bilingual individual .",
    "also , letting @xmath33 be the state of the individual at vertex @xmath34 at time @xmath35 , and letting @xmath36 denote the law of the process starting with @xmath37 we define the probability of invasion as @xmath38 interestingly , our results indicate that the probability of invasion strongly depends on the topology of the network of interactions , suggesting that , on regular graphs , it is decreasing with respect to the degree of the network , a property that can not be captured by the mean - field model since it excludes any spatial structure . to begin with , we look at finite graphs .",
    "our first theorem extends the first result found for the mean - field model : word @xmath1 can invade word @xmath0 for all @xmath3 .    ",
    "[ th : finite - graphs ] assume that @xmath39 is finite and @xmath3 .",
    "then , @xmath40 .",
    "note that on finite graphs @xmath41 is always positive but might vanish to zero as the population size increases .",
    "in contrast , theorem [ th : finite - graphs ] shows more particularly that the probability of invasion is bounded from below by a constant that depends on the ratio @xmath2 but not on the number of vertices .",
    "the idea of the proof is to show first that a certain function of the number of type @xmath1 individuals and the number of type @xmath0 individuals is a supermartingale with respect to the @xmath42-algebra generated by the process and then apply the optimal stopping theorem .",
    "our next result indicates that the invadability condition in theorem [ th : finite - graphs ] is sharp for complete graphs in the sense that the probability of invasion vanishes to zero as the population increases when @xmath27 .",
    " [ th : complete - graphs ] assume that @xmath39 is the complete graph with @xmath43 vertices .",
    "then , @xmath44    in the proof of theorem [ th : finite - graphs ] , the dynamics of the number of type @xmath1 and type @xmath0 is expressed as a function of the number of edges of different types .",
    "the complete graph is the only graph for which the number of edges of different types can be expressed as a function of the number of individuals of different types . also , one of the keys to proving the theorem is to use the fact that , on complete graphs , the number of individuals in different states becomes a markov chain .",
    "the combination of both theorems indicates that the dynamics of the naming game on complete graphs is well captured by the mean - field approximation .",
    "our next result shows more interestingly that this is not true for the process on the infinite one - dimensional lattice , suggesting that the critical value for the ratio of the fitnesses decreases as the degree of the graph decreases .    ",
    "[ th:1d ] in one dimension , @xmath45 whenever @xmath46 where @xmath47    the proof of theorem [ th:1d ] is based on the analysis of the interface between individuals in different states , which is only possible in one dimension .",
    "the bound @xmath48 is not sharp but our approach to prove the theorem together with the obvious symmetry of the model implies that the critical ratio is between @xmath49 and @xmath48 , which suggests that the critical ratio is equal to one : the probability of a successful invasion is positive if and only if @xmath50 .",
    "finally , we look at the naming game on regular lattices in higher dimensions . in this case , using a block construction to compare the process properly rescaled in space and time with oriented site percolation , it can be proved that the probability of invasion is positive for @xmath2 sufficiently large .",
    " [ th : lattice ] in any dimension , @xmath45 whenever @xmath2 is large enough .    our approach can be improved to get an explicit bound for the critical value for @xmath2 but this bound is far from being optimal .",
    "we conjecture as in one dimension that the critical ratio is equal to one , which is supported by numerical simulations of the process .",
    "more generally , we conjecture that , on connected graphs in which the degree is uniformly bounded by a fixed constant @xmath51 , the critical value is equal to one in the sense that the probability of invasion is bounded from below by a positive constant that only depends on @xmath51 , in disagreement with the mean - field model .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < , < , < \" , ]     in this section , we state some basic properties about the naming game that will be useful in the subsequent sections .",
    "a common aspect of all our proofs is to think of the process as being constructed graphically from independent poisson processes that indicate the time of the interactions , a popular idea in the field of interacting particle systems due to harris @xcite . in the case of the naming game",
    ", additional collections of uniform random variables must be introduced to also indicate the outcome of each interaction .",
    "more precisely , for every edge @xmath52 , we let    * @xmath53 be the arrival times of a rate one poisson process , and * @xmath54 be independent uniform random variables over @xmath55 .",
    "collections of random variables attached to different edges are also independent .",
    "the process is then constructed as follows : at time @xmath56 , the states at @xmath34 and @xmath57 are simultaneously updated according to the transitions in the left column of table [ tab : coupling ] .",
    "since interactions involving both words can each result in two different outcomes depending on whether word @xmath1 or word @xmath0 is pronounced , the random variable @xmath58 is used to account for the probability of each outcome as indicated by the conditions in the middle column of the table where @xmath59 note that @xmath60 is the probability that word @xmath1 is pronounced in a conversation involving a bilingual individual and a type @xmath0 individual .",
    "one can easily check that the conditions in the table indeed produce the desired transition probabilities in . based on this graphical representation ,",
    "processes with different parameters or starting from different initial configurations can be coupled to prove important monotonicity results .",
    "the next lemma shows for instance a certain monotonicity of the naming game with respect to its initial configuration , which can be viewed as the analog of attractiveness for spin systems .",
    "this result will be useful in the proof of theorem [ th:1d ] .    ",
    "[ lem : attractive ] let @xmath61 and @xmath62 be two copies of the naming game . then , @xmath63 for all @xmath64 provided this holds for all @xmath65 .",
    "the result follows from a coupling of the two processes that we construct conjointly from the same graphical representation .",
    "that is , we assume that @xmath66 and that both processes are constructed from the same poisson processes and the same collections of uniform random variables .",
    "the construction given by harris @xcite , which relies on arguments from percolation theory , implies that , for any small enough time interval , there exists a partition of the vertex set into almost surely finite connected components such that any two vertices in two different components do not influence each other in the time interval .",
    "since the number of interactions in each component in the time interval is almost surely finite , the result can be proved for each of these finite space - time regions by induction .",
    "assume that @xmath67 for some arrival time @xmath68 . to prove that the previous relationship between both processes is preserved at time @xmath35 , we observe that the interaction between the individuals at @xmath34 and @xmath57 can result in ten different transitions depending on the state of both individuals .",
    "these transitions are listed in the left column of table [ tab : coupling ] and can be divided into two types :    * the transitions that create an @xmath1 or remove a @xmath0 , which are labeled 2a5a , * the transitions that create a @xmath0 or remove an @xmath1 , which are labeled 2b5b .    as previously mentioned , except for transitions 1a and 6b , every other pair of states for the neighbors can result in two possible transitions depending on whether word @xmath1 or word @xmath0 is pronounced during the conversation .",
    "the last column of the table indicates that for all possible simultaneous updates of both processes , the ordering between both processes is preserved at time @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath69 to prove , as indicated in the last column , that a transition 2b in the first process indeed excludes the transitions 3a and 4a in the second process , we observe that @xmath70 which gives the implication @xmath71 and proves the exclusion of type 3a and 4a transitions .",
    "similarly , @xmath72 showing that the transitions 3b and 4b in the first process exclude transition 5a in the second process .",
    "as previously mentioned , the lemma follows from the fact that all possible simultaneous updates of both processes given in the last column preserve the desired ordering .",
    "this section is devoted to the proofs of theorem [ th : finite - graphs ] and theorem [ th : complete - graphs ] about the naming game on finite connected graphs .",
    "the key to proving the first theorem is to show that a certain process that depends on the difference between the number of individuals using word @xmath1 and the number of individuals using word @xmath0 is a supermartingale with respect to the natural filtration of the naming game , which allows to directly deduce the theorem from the optimal stopping theorem . to prove the second theorem which specializes in the process on complete graphs ,",
    "the idea is to observe that , as long as bilingual individuals do not interact with each other , there is no type @xmath1 individual in the population and the number of bilingual individuals evolves like a subcritical birth and death process that goes extinct quickly . throughout this section , @xmath73 and @xmath74",

    "+   + the reason for introducing the birth and death process above is that the number of bilingual individuals evolves precisely according to this process until two bilingual individuals interact with each other , an event that we call a collision .",
    "in particular , it can be deduced from the previous lemma that the probability that a collision ever happens is small when @xmath43 is large , which is also a bound for the probability that word @xmath1 outcompetes word @xmath0 . to prove this result , we let @xmath117 be the time of the first collision .

    "this implies that , before the first collision , the number of bilingual individuals has evolved according to the birth and death process in which individuals independently give birth at rate @xmath102 and die at rate @xmath103 .",

    "the rest of the proof relies on the fact that the probability that the number of jumps in the birth and death process is large and the probability that there is a collision in the naming game coupled with the birth and death process when the number of jumps is small are both small when the graph is large .",

    "more precisely , we have the following lemma .        1 .   between time @xmath206 and time @xmath207 , there are at least two good interactions along each of the eight edges labeled 1 on the left - hand side , 2 .   between time @xmath206 and time @xmath207 , there is no bad interaction along any of the sixteen edges labeled 2 on the left - hand side , 3 .   between time @xmath207 and time @xmath208",
    ", there is at least one good and no bad interaction along each of the eight edges labeled 3 on the right - hand side , 4 .   between time @xmath207 and time @xmath209",
    ", there is no bad interaction along any of the sixteen edges labeled 4 on the right - hand side .",
    "from  and the probabilities in table [ tab : coupling ] , it follows that an interaction involving at least one individual using word @xmath1 can only result in one of the transitions 1a5a in the table .",
    "in particular , whenever site @xmath210 is an @xmath1-site and our good event 14 occurs , the following holds :    * at time @xmath207 , all twelve vertices marked with a black dot @xmath211 on the right - hand side of the figure are of type @xmath1 and * between @xmath212 and @xmath209 , all sixteen vertices in the figure are of type @xmath1 .    in particular , letting @xmath213 be the event that @xmath210 is an @xmath1-site , we deduce that @xmath214 now , let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be the number of good and bad interactions that occur along one given edge in a given time interval of length @xmath96 . since interactions occur along each edge of the lattice at rate one and are independently good with probability @xmath215 @xmath216 in particular , for all @xmath106 , the probability of the good event 14 is @xmath217 for all @xmath2 large enough .",
    "finally , we observe that the good event @xmath205 is measurable with respect to the graphical representation in the space - time region @xmath218 \\times [ 0 , 4 t ) \\ } \\ \\subset \\ { \\mathbb{z}}^2 \\times [ 0 , \\infty).\\ ] ] this , together with the inclusion and the lower bound are exactly the comparison assumptions of theorem 4.3 in @xcite , from which the lemma directly follows .",
    "+   + it is known from standard results based on the so - called contour argument that , for @xmath106 small enough , there exists with positive probability an infinite cluster of wet sites in the two dependent oriented site percolation process on @xmath192 starting with one open site at level 0 and in which sites at the other levels are open with probability @xmath202 .",
    "this , together with lemma [ lem : block ] , implies that , for the naming game starting with a single bilingual individual , @xmath219 this proves survival of word @xmath1 but not extinction of word @xmath0 with positive probability .",
    "in fact , a weaker form of survival can be proved in the more general case when @xmath3 by simply using techniques similar to the ones in the proof of lemma [ lem : supermartingale ] to show that the number of individuals using word @xmath1 is a submartingale .",
    "however , extinction of word @xmath0 with positive probability can not be deduced from this approach .",
    "in contrast , our coupling with oriented site percolation combined with an idea of the author @xcite that extends a result of durrett @xcite can be used to complete the proof of the theorem .",
    "this is done in the next lemma .      throughout the proof ,",
    "we think of the naming game as being coupled with oriented site percolation as in the statement of lemma [ lem : block ] . to begin with ,",
    "we follow @xcite by introducing the new oriented graph @xmath220 with the same vertex set as @xmath192 but in which there is an oriented edge @xmath221 see the right - hand side of figure [ fig : graphs ] for a picture in @xmath195 .",
    "we say that a site in the percolation process is dry if it is not wet .",
    "also , for @xmath222 , we write @xmath223 and say that there is a dry path connecting both sites if there is a sequence @xmath224 such that the following two conditions hold :      note that a dry path in @xmath192 is also a dry path in @xmath220 but the reciprocal is false . now",
    ", the proofs of lemmas 411 in durrett @xcite imply the following : there exists @xmath106 small such that , for the percolation process on @xmath192 with parameter @xmath202 starting with @xmath230 open and all the other sites closed at level zero , conditioned on the event that percolation occurs , we have @xmath231 for some @xmath232 . in words , if the density of open sites is close enough to one , there is a linearly expanding region in which ( even closed ) sites can not be reached from a path of dry sites starting at level zero .",
    "this applies to dry paths in the graph @xmath192 but as pointed out in @xcite , the proofs of lemmas 411 in durrett @xcite easily extend to give for dry paths in @xmath220 . to conclude the proof , the last step is to show the connection between dry paths and @xmath1-sites .",
    "assume that @xmath233 since word @xmath0 can not appear spontaneously , this implies the existence of @xmath234 which in turn implies that @xmath235 note however that this does not imply the existence of a dry path in @xmath192 which is the reason why we introduced a new graph with additional edges . taking the probability of the event in and the probability of the sub - event in directly gives @xmath236 where @xmath210 is the unique site such that @xmath237 .",
    "since @xmath106 can be made arbitrarily small by choosing @xmath2 large , the analog of for oriented dry paths in the graph @xmath220 together with the inequality implies that , conditioned on the event that percolation occurs , @xmath238 for the naming game conditioned on the event that @xmath230 is an @xmath1-site . since the probability that percolation occurs is positive for @xmath106 small and since there is a positive probability for the process starting with a single bilingual individual at the origin that all sites in the spatial box @xmath239 are of type @xmath1 at time one , the lemma and theorem [ th : lattice ] follow ."
