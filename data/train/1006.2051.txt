    "the unavoidable interaction between the open quantum processor and its environment corrupts the information stored in the system and causes errors that may lead to wrong outputs .",
    "there are different methods for preserving quantum coherence .",
    "one possible technique exploits the redundancy in encoding information .",
    "this scheme is known as `` quantum error correcting codes '' ( qeccs ) . for a comprehensive introduction to qeccs",
    ", we refer to @xcite . within such scheme",
    ", information is encoded in linear subspaces ( codes ) of the total hilbert space in such a way that errors induced by the interaction with the environment can be detected and corrected .",
    "the qecc approach may be interpreted as an active stabilization of a quantum state in which , by monitoring the system and conditionally carrying on suitable operations , one prevents the loss of information .",
    "another possible approach is the so - called `` decoherence free subspaces '' ( dfss ) ( also known as error avoiding or noiseless codes ) . for a comprehensive introduction to dfss",
    ", we refer to lidar03 .",
    "it turns out that for specific open quantum systems ( noise models in which all qubits can be considered symmetrically coupled with the same environment ) , it is possible to design states that are hardly corrupted rather than states that can be easily corrected ( in this sense , dfss  are complementary to qeccs ) . in other words , it is possible to encode information in linear subspaces such that the dynamics restricted to such subspaces is unitary .",
    "this implies that no information is loss and quantum coherence is maintained .",
    "dfs is an example of passive stabilization of quantum information .    the formal mathematical description of the qubit - environment interaction is usually given in terms of quantum channels .",
    "quantum error correction is usually developed under the assumption of i.i.d .",
    "( identically and independently distributed ) errors .",
    "these error models are characterized by memoryless communication channels @xmath2 such that @xmath3-channel uses is given by @xmath4 .",
    "in such cases of complete independent decoherence , qubits interact with their own environments which do not interact with each other .",
    "however , in actual physical situations , qubits do interact with a common environment which unavoidably introduces correlations in the noise .",
    "for instance , there are situations where qubits in a ion trap set - up are collectively coupled to their vibrational modes @xcite . in other situations , different qubits in a quantum dot design are coupled to the same lattice , thus interacting with a common thermal bath of phonons @xcite .",
    "the exchange of bosons between qubits causes spatial and temporal correlations that violate the condition of error independence @xcite .",
    "memory effects introduce correlations among channel uses with the consequence that @xmath5 .",
    "recent studies try to characterize the effect of correlations on the performance of qeccs @xcite .",
    "it appears that correlations may have negative @xcite or positive @xcite impact on qeccs depending on the features of the error model being considered .",
    "devising new good quantum codes for both independent and correlated noise models is a highly non trivial problem .",
    "however , it is usually possible to manipulate existing codes to construct new ones suitable for more general error models and with higher performances @xcite .",
    "concatenation is perhaps one of the most successful quantum coding tricks employed to produce new codes from old ones .",
    "the concept of concatenated codes was first introduced in classical error correcting schemes by forney @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , concatenation is a method of combining two codes ( an inner and an outer code ) to form a larger code . in classical error correction ,",
    "forney has carried on extensive studies of concatenated codes , how to choose the inner and outer codes , and what error probability threshold values can be achieved .",
    "the first applications of concatenated codes in quantum error correction appear in @xcite .",
    "in the quantum setting , concatenated codes play a key role in fault tolerant quantum computation and in constructing good degenerate quantum error correcting codes .",
    "for instance , shor s degenerate code can be constructed by concatenating the three - qubit bit flip and phase flip codes .",
    "it is known that dfss are efficient under conditions in which each qubit couples to the same environment ( collective decoherence ) while ordinary qeccs are designed to be efficient when each individual qubit couples to a different environment ( independent decoherence ) @xcite . while none of the two error correction schemes is effective in the extreme limit when the other is , qeccs will still work for correlated errors @xcite , whereas dfss will not work in the independent error case lidar98 .",
    "therefore , it would be of interest to study the performance of concatenated codes obtained by combining dfss and qeccs for explicit noise models in the presence of partially correlated errors . indeed",
    ", this will be one of the main purposes in our work .    in this article",
    ", we study the performance of simple error correcting and error avoiding quantum codes together with their concatenation for correlated noise models . specifically , we consider two error models : i ) a bit - flip ( phase - flip ) noisy markovian memory channel ( model i ) ; ii ) a memory channel defined as a memory degree dependent linear combination of memoryless channels with kraus decompositions expressed solely in terms of tensor products of @xmath0-pauli ( @xmath1-pauli ) operators ( model ii ) .",
    "the performance of both the three - qubit bit flip ( phase flip ) and the error avoiding codes suitable for the considered error models is quantified in terms of the entanglement fidelity .",
    "we explicitly show that while none of the two codes is effective in the extreme limit when the other is , the three - qubit bit flip ( phase flip ) code still works for high enough correlations in the errors , whereas the error avoiding code does not work for small correlations .",
    "finally , we consider the concatenation of such codes for both error models and show that it is particularly advantageous for model ii in the regime of partial correlations .",
    "the layout of this article is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly discuss about the concatenation technique in quantum coding , the dfss and , the entanglement fidelity as a performance measure of quantum error correction schemes . in section iii , we evaluate the performances of the three - qubit bit flip code and suitable dfss for error models i  and ii .",
    "the performance of the concatenated code for both models appears in section iv .",
    "finally , in section v , we present our concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss about the concatenation technique in quantum coding , the dfss and , the entanglement fidelity .      for the sake of simplicity we only use two layers of concatenation and consider single qubit encoding .",
    "the generalization to arbitrary @xmath6 layers of concatenation and multi - qubit encoding is relatively straightforward gaitan .",
    "assume the inner code ( first layer ) is a @xmath7 $ ] stabilizer code @xmath8 with generators @xmath9 , and the outer code ( second layer ) is a @xmath10 $ ] stabilizer code @xmath11 with generators @xmath12 .",
    "the concatenated code @xmath13 is to map @xmath14 qubits into @xmath15 qubits , with code construction parsing the @xmath3 qubits into @xmath16 blocks @xmath17 ( @xmath18 , ... , @xmath16 ) each containing @xmath19 qubits . in other words ,",
    "given a codeword @xmath20 for the inner code @xmath8,@xmath21where @xmath22 are basis vectors for @xmath8 , the concatenated code @xmath23 is constructed as follows . for any codeword @xmath24 for the outer code @xmath11,@xmath25with @xmath26 ... @xmath27 , replace each basis vector @xmath28 with @xmath29 , ... ,",

    ", we simply point out that the above mentioned construction produces a @xmath35 $ ] code with @xmath36 . as an illustrative example , consider a concatenated code that is based on @xmath6 layers of concatenation of the same code , for instance the seven - qubit @xmath37 $ ] css  code . here ,",
    "an unencoded qubit is encoded into a block of seven qubits .",
    "next each qubit is itself encoded into a block of seven qubits . repeating this process @xmath6 times",
    "produces the concatenated code in which one logical qubit is recursively encoded into the state of @xmath38 physical qubits .",
    "thus , such concatenated code is a @xmath39 $ ] code with @xmath40 . recall that a distance @xmath41 qecc can correct @xmath42 errors , where @xmath43 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] is the integer part of @xmath45 . since @xmath40",
    ", we see that the number of errors that a concatenated code can correct grows exponentially with the number of layers of concatenation @xmath6 . therefore , concatenation can be a good coding trick as long as the error model at each encoding level has the same form ,",

    "we point out that it is not unreasonable to quantify the performance of both active and passive qec schemes by means of the same performance measure .",
    "we recall the concept of entanglement fidelity as a useful performance measure of the efficiency of quantum error correcting codes .",
    "entanglement fidelity is a quantity that keeps track of how well the state and entanglement of a subsystem of a larger system are stored , without requiring the knowledge of the complete state or dynamics of the larger system .",
