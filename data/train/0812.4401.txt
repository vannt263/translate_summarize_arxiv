    "a longitudinal diffusion wake still forms during the fluid evolution stage , and its contribution will still dominate the resulting angular inter - particle correlations though a peak occurs around the expected mach cone angle in the cf freeze - out .",
    "the reason is that transverse momentum deposition will force the fluid around the jet to expand , and the empty space left will create a shock wave in the longitudinal direction that behaves much like a diffusion wake . in terms of ideal hydrodynamics , this universality of the diffusion wake can be understood in the context of vorticity conservation since momentum deposition , whether transverse or longitudinal , will add vorticity to the system .",
    "this vorticity will always end up behaving as a diffusion wake @xcite . in the next section , we demonstrate that these results are largely independent of whether the jet is fully quenched or survives as a hard trigger .",
    "in the previous section we considered a uniformly moving jet that deposited energy and/or momentum in the medium at a constant rate . however , due to its interaction with the plasma , the jet will decelerate and its energy and/or momentum loss will change .",

    "<S> we solve ( 3 + 1)dimensional ideal hydrodynamical equations with source terms that describe punch - through and fully stopped jets in order to compare their final away - side angular correlations in a static medium . for fully stopped jets , </S>",
    "<S> the backreaction of the medium is described by a simple bethe  bloch - like model which leads to an explosive burst of energy and momentum ( bragg peak ) close to the end of the jet s evolution through the medium . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly enough , we find that the medium s response and the corresponding away - side angular correlations are largely insensitive to whether the jet punches through or stops inside the medium . </S>",
    "<S> this result is also independent of whether momentum deposition is longitudinal ( as generally occurs in pqcd energy loss models ) or transverse ( as the bethe  </S>",
    "<S> bloch formula implies ) . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the diffusion wake is therefore shown to be universal to all scenarios where momentum as well as energy is deposited into the medium , which can readily be understood in ideal hydrodynamics through vorticity conservation . the particle yield coming from the strong forward moving diffusion wake that is formed in the wake of both punch - through and stopped jets largely overwhelms their weak mach cone signal after freeze - out . </S>"
