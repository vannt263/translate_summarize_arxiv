    "the standard central limit theorem ( clt ) asserts that , under appropriate conditions , the probability density of the sum of large number of independent identically distributed ( _ iid _ ) random variables will be approximately normal ( or gaussian ) @xcite .",
    "the first complete proof was given in 1901 by liapunov @xcite , who worked analitically with characteristic functions .",
    "lindeberg gave a complete proof of the clt under more general conditions than liapunov in his 1922 paper @xcite .",
    "the clt explains why many stochastic processes are of relevance in physics , chemistry , biology , economics , etc .",
    "one of the fundamental importance of clt for statistical mechanics is that if a clt is valid for the driving forces in a many - body system , it is easy to proceed to the formalism of statistical mechanics via the langevin and fokker - planck approaches .",
    "it is also well - known that there are clts for the deterministic dynamical systems .",
    "although deterministic dynamical systems have deterministic algorithms and therefore never be completely independent , if the assumption of _ iid _ is replaced by the weaker property that the dynamical system is sufficiently strongly mixing , then various clts for these systems are also shown to be valid @xcite . here , ``",
    "sufficiently strongly mixing '' implies ergodicity and just means asymptotic statistical independence for large time differences . in this case",
    "the standard clt is valid for deterministic dynamical systems .",
    "if the iterates of deterministic dynamical systems have strong correlations like at the edge of chaos where the system is only weakly chaotic , then the standard clt is not valid .",
    "in fact , many complex systems in nature , such as financial data @xcite , earthquakes @xcite , long - range interacting many body systems @xcite , exhibit strong correlations among appropriate random variables . at least for a class of certain strong correlations ( referred to as @xmath0-independence )",
    ", it has been analytically shown that the attractors are @xmath0-gaussians leading to a @xmath0-genaralization of the standard clt @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-gaussian distributions , defined as ,    @xmath2^{1/(1-q ) } ,   \\label{q - gaussian}\\ ] ]    ( where @xmath3 controls the width of the distribution ) are the distributions that optimize the nonadditive entropy @xmath4 ( defined to be @xmath5 ) , on which nonextensive statistical mechanics is based @xcite . as @xmath6 ,",
    "@xmath0-gaussians recover the gaussian distribution .    in recent years",
    ", many dissipative deterministic dynamical systems like cubic map , logistic map and logaritmic map are numerically investigated in terms of their central limit behaviour @xcite .",
    "the common property for all of these examples is that they exhibit period doubling route to chaos .",
    "another dissipative but high dimensional system known as kuramoto model has also been studied within the same context @xcite . finally , a very recent work has also appeared as a first attempt of a similar analysis of conservative maps @xcite .",
    "in this work , we focus our attention to another one - dimensional dissipative dynamical system , known as sine - circle map @xcite , which differs from the above - mentioned maps since it exhibits quasi - periodic route to chaos .",
    "we are mainly interested in two important questions : ( i )  what are the typical probability distributions in the vicinity of the quasi - periodic edge of chaos ?",
    "what is the relationship between the degree of quasi - periodicity of trajectories and the complete shape of appropriate limit distribution ?",
    "let us start by introducing the sine - circle map    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is a point on a circle and parameter @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 ) is a measure of the strength of the nonlinearity .",
    "it describes dynamical systems possessing a natural frequency @xmath11 which are driven by an external force of frequency @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the bare winding number or frequence - ratio parameter ) and belongs to the same universality class of the forced rayleigh - benard convection @xcite . winding number for this map",
    "is defined to be the limit of the ratio    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is angular distance traveled after @xmath16 iterations of the map function .",
    "the map is monotonic and invertible ( nonmonotonic and noninvertable ) for @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and develops a cubic inflexion point at @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "the winding number @xmath21 can be numerically computed from eq .",
    "( [ winding ] ) forming a `` devil s staircase '' shown in fig .  1 .",
    "once mode is locked , it is noted that @xmath22 does not change for a substantial range of @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath23 belongs to a constant interval of the devil s staircase ( @xmath24 is commensurate ) , then @xmath22 is rational number ( is also called mod - locked ) and the behavior of the system is periodic , otherwise , i.e. , if @xmath23 does not belong to a constant interval ( @xmath24 is incommensurate ) , then @xmath22 is irrational number and the behavior of the system is quasi - periodic .    at the onset of chaos where @xmath20 , a set of zero measure and universal scaling dynamics is produced at special irrational dressed winding numbers",
    ". they can be approximated by a sequence of truncated continued fractions .",
    "the most interesting and well - studied case is the sequence of rational approximants to @xmath25 which is called the golden mean and this has the form of an infinite continued - fraction    @xmath26    if fraction lines stop at @xmath27 denominator , it is the @xmath27th order approximation to the golden mean .",
    "it is also easy to see that the @xmath27th approximation to the golden mean is given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is @xmath27th fibonacci number and @xmath30 is the @xmath27th convergent for the golden mean .",
    "this states that the sequence of rational numbers @xmath30 converges to the irrational number @xmath31 as @xmath32 , yielding the frequency - ratio parameter to approach its limiting value @xmath33 .",
    "this map has already been studied in @xcite at the edge of chaos , where the sensitivity to initial condition behavior has numerically analyzed for the first time and its connection with the nonextensive statistical mechanics has been established .",
    "then , the numerical results given in @xcite have been analytically proven by hernandez - saldana and robledo @xcite . in the remainder of this work , we focus on the probability density of rescaled sum of iterates of the sine - circle map in the strongly chaotic regime and at the quasi - periodic edge of chaos and discuss the main features of the probability distribution as the quasi - periodic edge of chaos",
    "is approached .",
    "generally , one can consider the sine - circle map given in eq .",
    "( [ circlemap ] ) and investigate the behavior of this dynamical system where it is strongly chaotic . when this is the case , implying asymptotic statistical independence , then correlations among distributed random variables asymptotically converge to zero , and thus the standard clt is expected to be valid for this case .",
    "in order to numerically illustrate this , we can consider the sine - circle map at @xmath34 and @xmath35 where the map is strongly chaotic and check whether the probability distribution of    @xmath36    becomes gaussian for @xmath37 , after appropriately scaled and centered , regarding the initial value as a random variable . here",
    ", the average @xmath38 is calculated as time average . the result is given in fig .  2 where a clear convergence to a gaussian is evident as expected .     and @xmath35 .",
    "black dashed line corresponds to the gaussian @xmath39 .",

    "( b )  logarithmic plot of the same data where a linear tendency , which corroborates the gaussian behavior , is appreciated.,title=\"fig:\",height=226 ]      we are now at the position to investigate the behavior of the sine - circle map in the vicinity of the quasi - periodic edge of chaos for which the standard clt is not expected to be valid due to strong correlations among the iterates of the map . at the critical point the system is not ergodic and strongly mixing anymore . to numerically calculate the averages @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) , due to lack of ergodicity , it is necessary to take the average over not only a large number of @xmath40 iterations but also a large number of @xmath41 randomly chosen initial values    @xmath42    although this condition is of no importance at strongly chaotic regime because of ergodicity , this is certainly of great importance at the edge of chaos due to non - ergodicity .    at the exact quasi - periodic edge of chaos , we know that @xmath20 and the frequency - ratio parameter should be taken as an irrational number , like @xmath33 , corresponding to @xmath31 .",
    "unfortunately , in a numerical experiment , this parameter can never be obtained with infinite precision ( which means that the winding number is exactly equal to the golden mean value ) but can be approached with increasing precision ( namely , the winding number is getting closer to the exact golden mean value as larger fibonacci numbers are used ) . in this case , since the golden mean is approached with the ratio of the fibonacci numbers @xmath43 , the trajectory has the period @xmath44 .",
    "it means that trajectory returns to its starting point on the circle .",
    "therefore , there exist @xmath44 quasi - periodic bands of the attractor within its self - similar structure . as a result",
    ", the critical behavior of the map can never be numerically studied at the exact chaos threshold where the frequency - ratio parameter is expected to be completely irrational corresponding to the case of @xmath22 approaching to the golden mean with infinite precision , but can only be analyzed in the vicinity of the critical point , systematically getting closer to it by increasing the finite precision of the golden mean adjusting the frequency - ratio parameter .",
    "this procedure is exactly the same as the one used in @xcite for the same analysis of the logistic map .",
    "similar to the case of the logistic map , one can write down a scaling relation @xcite    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the feigenbaum constant , @xmath33 is the value whenever @xmath31 is achieved . in practice",
    "we localize the @xmath47 values from the scaling relation ( [ scaling ] ) and approach the critical point by increasing @xmath27 values .",
    "numerical values used throughout this work have been given in table  i.    .[tab : table ] numerical values of @xmath23 used in the simulations and the associated values of @xmath27 , @xmath30 and @xmath48 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as a result of above - mentioned procedure , we are not exactly at the chaos threshold and therefore the sum of iterates @xmath49 will essentially approach to a fixed value @xmath50 plus a small correction @xmath51 which describes the small fluctuations of the position of the @xmath52th iterate within the quasi - periodic band .",
    "therefore , one can write    @xmath53    and    @xmath54    if we continue this iteration @xmath44 times respectively , we obtain @xmath44 strongly correlated random variables @xmath55 at last . every new fluctuation @xmath56 is correlated with the others and correlations among these random variables decay very slowly if we are close to the irrational frequency - ratio parameter . also , we use the total of these strongly correlated random variables to obtain appropriate limit distribution function in the vicinity of the quasi - periodic edge of chaos    @xmath57    this clearly implies that , in order to see the convergence to the limit distribution , the appropriate number of iterations @xmath58 must be taken as    @xmath59    our main results are given in figs .  3 and 4 .",
    "we plot the probability density function in fig .",
    "3a for @xmath60 values approaching @xmath33 for the first three cases given in table  i with @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 with appropriate @xmath58 values obtained from the scaling relation .",
    "it is clearly seen from fig .",
    "3a that the curves have a tendency to converge to a limit distribution as the critical point is approached .",
    "it seems that the limit distribution can be well approximated by a @xmath0-gaussian with @xmath64 .",
    "when @xmath27 is small ( more distant case to the critical point ) , the data converges to this @xmath0-gaussian distribution at the more central regions but deviates in the tails .",
    "as @xmath27 increases ( getting closer to the critical point ) , this convergence develops towards the tails .",
    "it is clear that for a perfect convergence , one needs to achieve @xmath65 and @xmath66 limits . in order to further strengthen these results , we also plot in fig .",
    "3b the @xmath0-logarithm [ defined to be @xmath67 of the case which is the closest to the critical point that we can numerically obtain . a satisfactory agreement between the data and @xmath0-gaussian can easily be appreciated for the case with the largest @xmath27 ( better convergence in the tails could have been achieved if cases that are closer to the critical point would have been numerically attainable ) . in fig .",
    "4 we also give the same demonstration of fig .  3 for the closest case to the critical point where we have used @xmath68 with three different @xmath40 values which are smaller than @xmath58 since the value of @xmath58 is beyond the present computational limits .",
    "as expected , the limit distribution would converge to the appropriate @xmath0-gaussian for the _ entire region _ whenever @xmath69 .",
    "unfortunately , for the present case , since we are very close to the critical point , the appropriate @xmath58 value is far beyond our computational limits .",
    "nevertheless , as @xmath40 values increase , the convergence to the appropriate @xmath0-gaussian ( which is with @xmath70 ) , starting from the central part , can easily be seen . for the largest @xmath40 value that we can numerically attain ,",
    "almost the entire region ( the central part and the tails ) is well approached to the @xmath0-gaussian distribution .",
    "the observed behavior obtained here for the sine - circle map appears to be exactly similar to that of the logistic map in the sense that the numerical results agree better and better with the appropriate @xmath0-gaussian as the critical point is approached although the route to chaos here is via quasi - periodicity whereas it is via period doublings in the logistic map .",
    "the only difference is that the @xmath0 values obtained here are below unity , whereas for the logistic map they are always above unity .",

    "main results obtained in this work can be summarized as follows : ( i )  the sine - circle map , which belongs to the same universality class of the forced rayleigh - benard convection , is investigated and it is shown that its appropriate probability distribution approaching the quasi - periodic edge of chaos appears to be @xmath0-gaussian . up to now , in the literature , the only chaos route investigated within this procedure was the period doubling route where the @xmath0 values seem to be always larger than unity .",
    "since the quasi - periodic route to chaos is different from the period - doubling route to chaos , our analysis performed here can be thought as a step forward towards the inclusion of another route to chaos ( with @xmath1 ) to the phenomenon observed so far for the period - doubling route to chaos ( with @xmath76 ) . in this sense ,",
    "our results broaden the applicability region of the arguments argued in @xcite and provide further evidence to the proposition that , for certain classes of strongly correlated random variables , the rescaled sum of the iterates of such dynamical systems approaches a @xmath0-gaussian .",
    "( ii )  relationship between quasi - periodicity degree of trajectories and complete shape of appropriate probability distribution is investigated .",
    "it is seen that the probability distribution converges to a @xmath0-gaussian as irrationality degree of frequency - ratio parameter increases , which also means that the winding number approaches the golden mean value ( in other words , this is to say as the critical point is approached ) .",
