    "the identification of dark matter is one of the major open questions in physics , astrophysics , and cosmology .",

    "the nature of this non - baryonic dark matter is still unknown .",
    "one of the preferred candidates for non - baryonic dark matter is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) .",
    "substantial efforts have been dedicated to wimp searches in the last decades @xcite .",
    "a particularly active area @xcite are wimp direct searches , in which low - background devices are used to search for the nuclear recoil caused by the elastic scattering of galactic wimps with nuclei in the detector @xcite . in these searches ,",
    "characteristic signatures of a wimp signal are useful in discriminating a wimp signal against background .",
    "a wimp signature which was pointed out very early @xcite is an annual modulation of the direct detection rate caused by the periodic variation of the earth velocity with respect to the wimp `` sea '' while the earth goes around the sun .",
    "the typical amplitude of this modulation is 5% .",
    "a modulation with these characteristics was observed by the dama collaboration @xcite , but in light of recent results @xcite , its interpretation as a wimp signal is currently in question .",
    "different , and possibly clearer , wimp signatures would be beneficial .",
    "a stronger modulation , with an amplitude that may reach 100% , was pointed out by spergel in 1988  @xcite .",
    "spergel noticed that because of the earth motion around the sun , the most probable direction of the nuclear recoils changes with time , describing a full circle in a year . in particular",
    "this produces a strong forward - backward asymmetry in the angular distribution of nuclear recoils .",
    "unfortunately it has been very hard to build wimp detectors sensitive to the direction of the nuclear recoils .",
    "a promising development is the drift detector @xcite .",
    "the drift detector consists of a negative ion time projection chamber , the gas in the chamber serving both as wimp target and as ionization medium for observing the nuclear recoil tracks .",
    "the direction of the nuclear recoil is obtained from the geometry and timing of the image of the recoil track on the chamber end - plates",
    ". a 1 m@xmath0 prototype has been successfully tested , and a 10 m@xmath0 detector is under consideration .",
    "in addition to merely using directionality for background discrimination , what can be learned about wimp properties from the directionality of wimp detectors ? it is obvious that different wimp velocity distributions give rise to different recoil distributions in both energy and recoil direction .",
    "copi , heo , and krauss @xcite , and then copi and krauss @xcite , have examined the possibility of distinguishing various wimp velocity distributions using a likelihood analysis of the resulting recoil spectra , which they generated through a monte carlo program .",
    "they have concluded that a discrimination among common velocity distributions is possible with a reasonable number of detected events .",
    "here we want to gain insight into the properties of the nuclear recoil spectra in energy and direction . for this purpose ,",
    "we develop a simple formalism that relates the wimp velocity distribution to the distribution of recoil momenta .",
    "we find that the recoil momentum spectrum is the radon transform of the velocity distribution ( see eq .",

    ", we also need the expression for the wimp - nucleus scattering cross section .",
