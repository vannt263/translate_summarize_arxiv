    "the approximate locations of these detections are shown in figure [ subs ] .",
    "initial detections of substructure in this region were made contemporaneously by @xcite  by isolating foreground milky way dwarfs in a deep photometric survey of m31 that reveal an intervening main sequence ( ms )  and by rocha - pinto et al .",
    "( 2004  hereafter rp04 ) , using m giants from the 2mass catalog to identify a `` cloud - like '' spatial overdensity ( the m giants associated with triand from rp04 are shown as the light grey filled circles on figure [ subs ] ) .",
    "rp04 derived a mean metallicity of @xmath3 for the triand cloud and a distance range of 20 - 30 kpc , and they found a trend in the radial velocities in the galactic standard of rest frame ( @xmath4 ) as a function of galactic longitude such that there is a negative gradient in the direction towards the galactic anti - center .    using data from the megacam survey",
    ", @xcite subsequently analyzed 76 deg@xmath5 in a region southeast of m31 ( encompassed by the rp04 triand region  see the cyan rectangular region in figure [ subs ] ) and detected two mss  referred to here as triand1 and triand2  in a deep @xmath6 cmd , and separated by @xmath0 0.8 magnitudes in the @xmath7-band .",
    "@xcite assumed that their brighter sequence ( triand1 ) was associated with rp04 s triand cloud , and , adopting a single isochrone with [ fe / h]=@xmath8 and an age of 10 gyr , estimated the triand1/triand2 distances to be 22 kpc and 28 kpc respectively .",
    "@xcite updated their megacam photometric survey toward the triand region with deep @xmath9 and @xmath7 photometry covering 360 deg@xmath5 from the the panoramic andromeda archaeological survey ( pandas ) and found the region to be highly substructured , hosting a network of overlying streams and clouds .",
    "the approximate region for pandas is shown as the blue rectangle in figure [ subs ] .",
    "a very thin stream ( width of 75 pc ) , dubbed `` the triangulum stream , '' was detected photometrically in the sdss dr8 @xcite .",
    "the triangulum stream is at an estimated distance of 26 kpc and falls near the center of the triand spatial region identified by rp04 ( the feature is shown as the orange line in figure [ subs ] ) .",
    "a separate analysis of the transverse motions of 13 milky way halo stars @xcite ( the three purple filled stars in figure [ subs ]  one for each hst pointing ) suggested that they might be distributed in a shell - like distribution at a mean distance of 25 kpc .",
    "finally , the faint , dark - matter - dominated dwarf galaxy segue 2 has also recently been detected in the sdss @xcite ; using four blue horizontal branch stars in segue 2 ( the location is indicated by the green filled circle in figure [ subs ] ) , the distance is estimated by @xcite to be 35 kpc .    another prominent feature in this general region of the sky is the galactic anticenter stellar structure ( gass , also known as  the monoceros ring ",
    ", see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the megacam and pandas @xmath6 cmds @xcite also show the main sequence for gass .",
    "the nature of the gass system is still debated ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : there are n - body simulations that attempt to fit gass with tidal debris from an accreted dwarf satellite @xcite , but there are also claims that gass results from a disk disturbance @xcite .",
    "moreover , there are apparent continuities in the radial velocities of stars in the gass and triand features ( rp04 ) , leading to the possibility that the two features may be related and be part of the same system @xcite .",
    "high - resolution echelle spectra of stars in both features @xcite , however , show that the chemical patterns and distances are distinct , which casts doubt on their association : with isochrone fitting , @xcite find distances of @xmath0 12 kpc for the gass m giants and @xmath0 22 kpc for the triand m giants .",
    "clearly , the nature of and association between the various triand stellar overdensities remains unresolved .",
    "for example , rp04 speculated that the feature they found could be debris from the tidal disruption of a dwarf galaxy .",
    "their survey revealed associated stars covering a remarkable area , spanning nearly 2000 deg@xmath5 on the sky .",
    "however , the true extent and morphology of their feature remains unclear due to the obscuring foreground of galactic dust .",
    "the current detections could represent just a small piece of a much longer and broader continuous _ stream _ of stars from the destruction of a satellite on a mildly eccentric orbit , or they could be indicative of a distinct debris _ cloud _ formed from a satellite disrupting on a much more eccentric orbit with its debris collecting at orbital apocenters ( the internal view of delicate shell features seen around other galaxies ; see * ? ? ?",
    "the latter suggestion is particularly intriguing given the more recent work by @xcite that hint at a cold shell of main - sequence stars at similar distances . while shells around external galaxies have been studied extensively , clouds around the milky way have so far received little attention .",
    "stars in debris structures associated with clouds can briefly pass close to the galactic center as they rapidly flow through the pericenters of their eccentric orbits .",
    "thus , connecting debris in the inner galaxy to the more distant members of the same debris structures in clouds at the apocenters is a promising way of probing the radial density profile of dark matter in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "these potentially valuable gains in understanding properties of the galactic halo at both local and intermediate scales motivated us to further explore the nature of the triand stellar features .    in this work",
    ", we present an expanded survey of m giants in the triand region , building on the m giant study of @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :  [ phot ] explores the photometric properties of late - type 2mass stars in the triand region ; in  [ data ] , we describe how we established our catalog of triand m giant members ; in  [ spec ] , the spectroscopic and kinematical properties of the expanded triand m giant survey are presented ; and  [ disc ] summarizes the results and offers one model to explain them .",
    "to examine what substructures are apparent in triand using the 2mass catalog , we selected stars in the region @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "colors were restricted to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which should isolate a relatively pure sample of m giants @xcite .",
    "we targeted stars with @xmath12 .",
    "a reddening restriction of @xmath13 was applied to minimize the contribution of highly reddened sources close to the galactic plane .",
    "we used the same methodology as @xcite to deredden the stars ( i.e. , an interpolated value of the @xcite maps applied to each star ) .",
    "the upper - left panel of figure [ cmdmod ] shows a hess diagram of the selected 2mass stars with m giants from the rp04 study overplotted as green points in the upper - right panel . for comparison ,",
    "the lower - left panel shows the hess diagram for this same region using output generated from the galaxia synthetic model @xcite , with identical @xmath14 color , magnitude , and reddening restrictions applied to both the observational and synthetic data .",
    "the bottom - right panel shows the ratio of the observed and synthetic data ( 2mass / galaxia ) .",
    "three distinct rgb - like sequences are apparent from these comparisons : ( i ) the brightest and densest sequence ( emerging at @xmath15 and apparent in the bottom right panel ) is gass , which is known to extend into this part of the sky @xcite ; ( ii ) a second , slightly fainter sequence , seen emerging at @xmath16=(0.9,11.5 ) and spanning @xmath17 in the upper - left panel , traces out a clear rgb that stands out above the expected background level seen in galaxia in the lower - right panel ; and ( iii ) the locus of the rp04 giants ( upper - right panel ) , that are known to be coherent in velocity , traces a third , fainter sequence , emerging at @xmath16=(0.9,12 ) .",
    "we note , in generating their spectroscopic sample from the apparent overdensity on the sky and in a range of apparent magnitudes , rp04 employed a probability density function ( pdf ) for m giants in 2mass assuming that they followed a metallicity distribution centered at @xmath18 dex with a dispersion of 0.4 dex .",
    "the distance pdf for a single star thus had a large spread due to this uncertain metallicity distribution .",
    "this large scatter in the distance estimates , combined with the aim of avoiding contamination from gass and mw disk stars , caused rp04 to preferentially select the fainter rgb stars for follow - up spectroscopy .    to assess whether the latter two ( non - gass ) sequences can be more clearly distinguished , the magnitude difference , @xmath19 , for each m giant from a linear fiducial rgb locus line is computed ( see the left panels of figure [ fiduc ] ) ; the fiducial line used has a slope that is aligned with the bright ( non - gass ) feature emerging at @xmath16=(0.9,11.5 ) in the upper - left panel of figure [ cmdmod ] .",
    "the cmd in the top panel of figure [ fiduc ] shows stars selected from the same region as figure [ cmdmod ] , while the cmd in the bottom panel has a lower upper limit in galactic latitude @xmath20 of @xmath21 .",
    "( there is expected to be significant contamination from disk stars between @xmath22 , and the bottom panels improve the clarity of the features . )",
    "the right panels show histograms of the magnitude differences from the fiducial line .",
    "overdensities corresponding to gass ( at @xmath23 1.5 mags ) as well as the two fainter sequences ( at @xmath23 @xmath24 mags and @xmath23 @xmath3 mags ) are seen .",
    "overall , we conclude that there is an additional m giant population in the triand region apparent in 2mass that is clearly distinct from either the gass or triand sequences that have previsouly been identified in rp04 .",
    "one obvious interpretation of the two rgb sequences seen in the 2mass cmd in m giants in the triand region is that they are the counterparts of the two ms features detected in @xcite and dubbed triand1 and triand2 .    under this assumption",
    ", we simultaneously fit isochrones @xcite to the triand1 and triand2 mss identified in the @xcite @xmath6 cmd and @xmath25 magnitudes were transformed from the megacam to sdss system ; the megacam data was kindly provided by nicolas martin . ] and the m giant rgbs using isochrones in the sdss and 2mass @xmath14 photometric systems , respectively .",
    "the upper panels of figure [ megaiso ] show the megacam ( left ) and 2mass ( right ) cmds to which we fit the isochrones .",
    "the middle panels of figure [ megaiso ] show : on the left , the slanted black lines are the ms ridge lines to which we fit the isochrones and the parallel vertical black bars are the regions selected to constrain the color of the ms turn - off ( msto ) point ; on the right , the loci isolate the regions used to constrain the 2mass rgb / agb fits around the apparent sequences . for a given isochrone ,",
    "the rgb and agb tracks differ by only @xmath0 0.4 magnitudes for cool giants ( see , e.g. , figure 6 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we can not distinguish between these late evolutionary phases . the slope of the lines used to define the 2mass triand1/2 regions are the same as that of the fiducial in the left panels of figure [ fiduc ] .",
    "to simultaneously fit the isochrones in the 2mass and sdss filters , we looked at a grid of isochrones with metallicities ranging from @xmath26 to @xmath27 in steps of 0.1 dex .",
    "for each metallicity , we first found the distance modulus that matched to the ms ridge lines in the megacam cmd .",
    "second , we found the age range that falls between the msto bars .",
    "third , only isochrones that fit these two criteria and fell between the 2mass rgb loci were kept .",
    "only a small range of isochrones fit all three criteria , and table [ tab1 ] lists these isochrones .",
    "the range in possible solutions is fairly narrow for the simultaneous fit , in large part because of the requirement of both ( the brighter and fainter ) rgb sequences containing m giants : more metal - poor populations at ages spanning 5 - 12 gyr have rgb tips that are bluer than @xmath28=0.9 .",
    "isochrones that fall into the acceptable ranges reported in table [ tab1 ] are shown in the bottom panels of figure [ megaiso ] , where the solid lines are for triand1 and the dotted lines for triand2 .",
    "magnitude spreads of @xmath29 dex about the ms ridgelines fit to the two features in the megacam cmds are apparent .",
    "this suggests acceptable distance ranges of @xmath30 about the numbers in table [ tab1 ] , where @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 2 - 4 kpc for triand1 and @xmath32 3 - 6 kpc for triand2 ) .",
    "the estimates do indicate significant differences in distance ( 15 - 21 kpc versus 24 - 32 kpc ) and age ( 6 - 10 versus 10 - 12 gyr ) .",
    "the metallicity differences ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 @xmath33 to @xmath34 versus @xmath34 to @xmath35 ) between triand1 and triand2 are less pronounced .",
    "all taken together , the age , distance , and [ fe / h ] differences are suggestive of distinct populations , with the distance differences being the most robust .",
    "the derived distance of @xmath0 28 kpc for the fainter ms / rgb sequences strongly suggests that these are in fact the same stellar population .    in figure",
    "[ cmdobs ] , we show the 2mass cmd with @xmath16 boundary boxes for triand1 and triand2 overplotted . the @xmath28 boundaries were informed by the results of the isochrone fitting : the triand1 rbg ends at @xmath36 and the triand2 rgb ends at @xmath37 . on figure [ cmdobs ]",
    ", we also show the location of the stars targeted in this study and the rp04 giants on the @xmath16 cmd .",
    "after establishing the presence of multiple , distinct rgb sequences in the triand region , we now wish to explore those rgb features spectroscopically .",
    "figure [ cmdobs ] summarizes our spectroscopic targets , where we show program stars with @xmath38 0.9 ( see section [ mdwarfs ] for details ) .",
    "targets were selected from 2mass to fall around the sequences seen in figure [ cmdmod ] ; overall , 170 stars were observed . when combined with the 36 stars ( both dwarfs and giants ) from rp04",
    ", we analyze 206 total stars in this study .",
    "spectra for this work were collected over four observing runs , which are summarized in table [ runs ] .",
    "the november 2011 mdm run was beset by bad weather and electronic issues ( random noise due to a faulty cable , manifested as spurious spikes , was superimposed on the spectra ) and thus only a handful of stars from that run are of reliable quality .",
    "( we note here that the observing sample was restricted to @xmath39 0.90 after we determined that nearly all of the stars with @xmath40 were classified as m dwarfs based on the strength of the nir na doublet ; see section [ mdwarfs ] . )",
    "pre - processing of the spectra for all runs were carried out using the iraf @xmath41 task .",
    "variations in the bias level along the ccd chip were removed using the overscan strip on a frame - by - frame basis .",
    "biases were taken at the beginning and end of each night to verify that there were no significant drifts in the pedestal level .",
    "for wavelength calibration , xenear lamp frames were taken throughout the night at the same position as each target , to account for telescope flexure . to account properly for fringing in the quartz flat fields in the red ,",
    "a low - order polynomial was fit to the median - combined flats to create a normalized flat ( using the @xmath42 task ) and the science frames were divided by the normalized flat .",
    "the @xmath43 and @xmath44 tasks were used for 1-d extraction and pixel - to - wavelength calibration .",
    "the dispersion solution was applied using the @xmath45 task .",
    "the 1-d wavelength - calibrated spectra were cross - correlated against standard stars using the @xmath46 task , after running @xmath47 on all of the spectra to account for the earth s motion with respect to the barycenter of the solar system .",
    "the location of the night sky emission lines between 8400   to 8500   were checked for any systematic offsets during each night or individual offsets due to telescope flexure . the overall level of stability for the kpno 2.1-m was @xmath0 5 km s@xmath48 , with no systematic variation .",
    "the level was higher for the hiltner spectra ( for the nov 2011 and oct 2012 runs ) , with the variations shifted by up to @xmath0 10 km s@xmath48 in some cases ( these shifts , when present , caused the night sky lines to systematically appear at slightly bluer wavelengths ) .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocities for all targets are presented in table [ tab3 ] , where the velocity is the mean of the velocities found from running @xmath46 . on a given night ,",
    "anywhere from 3 to 8 standard stars were observed ; if a standard did not correlate well with the other standards  based on the derived radial velocity  then it was not included in the mean calculation .",
    "the errors reported by @xmath46 typically vary by only @xmath49 1 km s@xmath48 for the cross - correlation results with the standards , meaning that they are not an accurate measure of the true errors , so we do not compute a weighted mean velocity . modspec was set up to cover the spectral range 7900   to 9200   and goldcam covered 7500   to 9000  ; both modspec and goldcam had a spectral resolution of @xmath0 4  . in this spectral region , the ca ii triplet is the dominant feature and we used these lines to derive radial velocities .",
    "the errors on the radial velocities presented in table [ tab3 ] are the mean of the differences in the velocities found from cross - correlating the star with the radial velocity standards observed on that night .",
    "twenty program stars were repeat observations ; these results are listed in table [ dups ] .",
    "the average dispersion of the 20 repeat observations is @xmath49 7.1 km s@xmath48 .      despite color cuts applied to avoid the problem , contamination from m dwarfs",
    "is a concern for cool giant stars with @xmath50 12.5 @xcite .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the contamination rate rises to 66% for stars with a @xmath51-band limit of 17.1 ( ukidss @xmath51 filter . ] ) , even for a conservative blue limit of @xmath52 1.02 .    to remove dwarfs from our sample , we checked the strength of the na i doublet ( @xmath53 8183 , 8195 ) , which is gravity - sensitive and can be used to discriminate dwarfs and giants ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this was done by measuring the equivalent width ( ew ) of the na i doublet in two ways : ( i ) by fitting a gaussian to each line of the doublet simultaneously , and ( ii ) by numerical integration ( g. damke et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "because the doublet may be contaminated by a water - vapor telluric band ( which peaks at 8227  ) , we first applied a telluric correction to our spectra using the spectrum of the white dwarf star feige 11 as a telluric template , in the iraf task @xmath54 .",
    "afterwards , the spectra are normalized using the iraf task @xmath55 .",
    "this allows us to define the continuum as 1.0 for both ew measurement methods . in method ( i ) , the wavelength ranges covered by the gaussians ( to measure the absorbed flux from each line in the doublet ) are 8172 - 8187   and 8190 - 8197  .",
    "then , the fitted relation is used to measure the ew in the wavelength range 8172 - 8197  . in method ( ii ) , we used numerical integration to measure the ew in the bandpass 8179 - 8199  .",
    "figure [ ew ] compares these two equivalent widths individually ( in the left - hand panel ) as well as their distribution across the sample ( in the right - hand panel ) .",
    "there is generally good agreement between ews derived each way , although there is a slight systematic shift of @xmath56   for the ews determined using numerical integration for stars with ew @xmath57 2.0 ( giants ) , and a bit higher shift ( to 0.8  ) for the dwarfs .",
    "the amplitude of the gaussian derived using method ( i ) is always fit to a positive value , thus avoiding an unrealistic fit to an emission line ; this could explain the systematically lower values for the ews found using the gaussian fitting method .",
    "nevertheless , the methods generally agree and either can be used to discriminate the giants .",
    "the similarity of the estimates and the overall distributions suggests a cut requiring ew @xmath58 2.0 to isolate giants .    to verify that the na i doublet is a good discriminant of dwarfs and giants for our sample , and test the ew level chosen to make this distinction",
    ", we also looked at the location of the stars on the reduced proper motion diagram ( rpmd ) , where @xmath59 .",
    "for @xmath60 0.7 , dwarfs can be separated from giants using the rpmd ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we used proper motions from the ucac4 catalog @xcite to construct a rpmd to assess the correlation between the na i doublet strength and luminosity class .",
    "although the uncertainties on the proper motions for stars at these distances are quite large ( typically 4 mas yr@xmath48 , with a signal of 1 - 2 mas yr@xmath48 for giants ) , local dwarfs have proper motions at least an order of magnitude larger and thus can be reliably identified in a rpmd .",
    "figure [ rpmd ] shows the rpmd for the 158 program stars with ucac4 proper motions available ; the points are color - coded by the ew ( found using method i ) of the na i doublet .",
    "these ews correlate remarkably well with position in the rpmd : for ews @xmath57 2.0 ( shown as the red points ) , stars overwhelmingly fall into the region populated by giants ( @xmath61 ) .    to classify our sample stars , we tagged stars with either ew1 or ew2 less than 2.0 as a giant ; 58 of the 170 targets were classified as dwarfs using this methodology .",
    "our final catalog contains 142 m giants , with 30 giants from the rp04 sample and 112 newly identified triand giant members ( hereafter the `` s14 '' sample ) .",
    "drawing on our photometric and spectroscopic analyses of stars in the triand region , we now focus on the stars that ( i ) fall into the triand1/2 regions defined in figure [ cmdobs ] and ( ii ) are spectroscopically classfied as giants .",
    "application of the additional color - magnitude cuts ( i.e. , the color boundaries for the triand1 and triand2 boxes shown in figure [ cmdobs ] ) reduces the 142 giants identified in the previous section to 134 .",
    "the fact that we have restricted our sample to colors of @xmath62 means that our sample is inherently biased toward more metal - rich stars .",
    "eight of the very red rp04 giants do not fall into the triand boxes .",
    "these stars are very metal - poor ( rp04 reports 4 of the 8 as having [ fe / h ] @xmath63 , and 3 of the remainder have [ fe / h ] @xmath64 ) , suggesting that these stars are most likely carbon stars or in the thermally - pulsating agb phase . in this section",
    ", we further refine our sample by applying an iterative clipping to the radial velocities of the giants falling within the triand1/2 boxes to remove non - members of the triand groups ( section [ rv ] ) .",
    "next , we estimate [ fe / h ] for sub - samples of those giants with sufficiently high s / n spectra ( section [ feh ] ) .",
    "last , we use proper motions along with the estimated distances to triand1 and triand2 ( from the isochrone fits ) to estimate their transverse motions ( section [ pm ] ) .",
    "rp04 found a trend in the radial velocties of the m giants observed in the vicinity of the triand density peaks ( see their figure 4 ) .",
    "for our extended spectroscopic survey , the m giants follow this same trend , as shown in figure [ v4pan ] . in panel",
    "[ v4pan](a ) , the distribution of heliocentric radial velocities for all program stars ( including the stars from the rp04 study ) is shown , with stars classified as dwarfs in grey and those classified as giants in black .",
    "panel [ v4pan](b ) shows the radial velocities but now in the gsr frame=236 km s@xmath48 @xcite and ( @xmath65,@xmath66,@xmath67)=(11.1,12.24,7.25 ) km s@xmath48 @xcite to correct for solar motion . ] ( at rest with respect to the galactic center , to account for the total motion of the sun ) ; the dashed line plotted over the dwarf stars shows the expected trend for stars moving locally at @xmath68=236 km s@xmath48 , and the dotted line represents a circular orbit for stars at 25 kpc . in panel",
    "[ v4pan](c ) , the results of applying a 2.5-@xmath69 iterative clipping to the stars identified as giants are shown .",
    "the iterative clipping was done by fitting a first - order polynomial to @xmath4 as a function of galactic longitude and then removing 2.5-@xmath69 outliers iteratively .",
    "the iterative clipping leaves 109 stars classified as members of triand based on their @xmath4 trend in @xmath70 ( 18 rp04 giants and 91 s14 giants ) ; the polynomial used to reject outliers is shown as the black solid line in panel [ v4pan](c ) . in panel [ v4pan](d ) the giants from panel ( c ) are color - coded by their membership in triand1 ( blue circles ) or triand2 ( red circles ) .",
    "figure [ vgsrlb ] shows the spatial distribution of the triand m giants color - coded by their radial velocities ( in the gsr frame ) . from figure [ vgsrlb ] , we see the velocity gradient in the sense that @xmath4 is decreasing as the stars approach the galactic anti - center ( this is also seen in figure [ v4pan](c ) ) .",
    "we also note that almost all of the program stars observed with @xmath71 ( see figure [ subs ] for the spatial distribution of the targets ) have been eliminated : of the 31 program stars with @xmath71 , only three remain after removing dwarfs ( 20 removed ) and radial velocity outliers ( 8 removed ) .",
    "this suggests a lower spatial limit in galactic latitude for the triand overdensity .    as with the photometric identification of the features",
    ", we can compare the kinematical properties of the features to those expected for random field thick disk and halo stars in the milky way by looking at the @xmath4 distribution for a synthetic sample of stars generated from the galaxia model @xcite .",
    "figure [ modrvs ] shows the distributions of @xmath4 , where we separate the @xmath4 distribution for the 109 m giant triand members by whether they fall into the triand1 or triand2 boxes , with triand1 shown as the blue dotted distribution and triand2 as the red dashed distribution .",
    "an apparent difference in the @xmath4 distributions is seen : triand2 has a median near 40 km s@xmath48 and a fairly cold dispersion of @xmath72 25 km s@xmath48 , whereas triand1 stars show a prominent peak at @xmath4=50 - 60 km s@xmath48 and a similar dispersion .",
    "these dispersions are colder than expected for a random distribution of halo stars , but hotter than the @xmath4 dispersion for the sgr tidal stream ( @xmath72 10 km s@xmath48 ; @xcite ) and the orphan stream ( @xmath72 10 km s@xmath48 ; @xcite ) .    a two - sided ks - test of the triand1 and triand2 @xmath4 distributions results in a p - value of 0.65 , which means that we can not reject the null hypothesis that the two distributions were drawn from the same population .",
    "we also checked the kurtosis for each distribution : the @xmath4 distribution for triand1 is leptokurtic , with a kurtosis of 0.52 , while that for triand2 is platykurtic , with a kurtosis of -1.29 .",
    "the two - sided anderson - darling test was applied to the triand1/2 @xmath4 distributions , as this test is more sensitive to differences in the tails of the distributions @xcite ; the p - value for the anderson - darling test is 0.30 .",
    "although the p - value from the anderson - darling test is lower , we still can not reject the null hypothesis .",
    "the black solid line in figure [ modrvs ] shows the @xmath4 distribution for a mock galaxy with the same @xmath14 color - color and coordinate filters as applied to the observed stars , but now further restricted to show stars that fall into the triand1 and triand2 cmd boxes ( there are 206 stars in the subset of the mock galaxy after applying these restrictions ) .",
    "it is apparent that the dispersion of @xmath4 for stars in the mock distribution is much hotter than that for the observed stars .",
    "we conclude that while triand1 and triand2 sit at larger galactocentric radius than known disk populations , they are much more dynamically cold than the expected random halo population predicted by galaxia .      as an approximate and independent check on the metallicities derived from photometry using isochrones in section [ iso ] , we used spectral indices to derive metallicities for a subset of the s14 sample with sufficient s / n to give reliable results .    all spectra taken for this study",
    "include the near - ir ca ii triplet .",
    "several studies have explored the relation between the ca ii triplet and [ fe / h ] for stars using spectral indices @xcite .",

    "furthermore , there are very few m giants in the 2mass catalog in this region , which implies that the `` triangulum stream '' may indeed be metal - poor  as found by @xcite  and thus would not contain many ( any ) m giants .      in a recent study of the velocity anisotropy of the milky way s halo",

    "to make a more general assessment of the possibility of an association , we ask how many dwarf stars we would _ expect _ to fall in the @xcite sample given the number of m giants we detect in the region .",
    "we estimate the expected density of m giants and ms / to halo stars in the distance range covered by this study and the @xcite study by comparing the luminosity functions appropriate to the magnitude ranges spanned for each stellar population ( i.e. , @xmath12 for the giants and @xmath114 for the dwarfs ) .",
    "the spatial region studied by @xcite is much smaller than ours , so we must scale the numbers accordingly .",

    "we assume a population with an age of 10 gyr and [ fe / h]=@xmath116 at a distance of 25 kpc ( these are approximate averages for the two populations identified ) to find the relative number of giants and dwarfs .",
    "after appropriately scaling the number of stars per unit mass to account for the different areas probed , we find a ratio ( n@xmath117/n@xmath118)@xmath119 of .0197 , meaning there should be roughly 1 dwarf in the @xcite sample for every 51 giants in the region that fell in the 2mass seletion boxes .",
    "the estimated contamination rate for dwarfs for stars with @xmath120 ( i.e. , the randomly sampled region ) is 40/175 , or @xmath0 23% .",

    "therefore , the observed ratio is 13/149 or roughly 1 dwarf for every 12 giants .",
    "overall this suggests that while we can not rule out that the @xcite sample could be part of the same dynamical substructure as triand , the deason stars are not part of the same stellar population and there is no conclusive evidence for association between them .",

    "the authors call this feature the pandas mw stream and identify an overdensity of stars in the western portion of the stream as its possible progenitor .",
    "the mw stream has some properties that are consistent with the @xcite simulations of the gass feature .",
    "this , along with the thin extent of the stream , lead @xcite to suppose that the mw stream is due to the tidal disruption of a dwarf galaxy that was accreted on a low eccentricity , planar orbit .",
    "the pandas field at @xmath124 17 kpc shows a higher background ( `` low - level substructure '' ) than the three other regions analyzed ( see figure 2 of @xcite ) and it seems apparent that the triand1 feature is present in this region .",
    "similarly , the region at @xmath124 27 kpc ( panel 4 in figure 2 of @xcite ) contains a wispy feature just south of m31 that appears to be one of the overdense regions in triand2 ( i.e. , the overdensity in figure 2 of rp04 , centered roughly at @xmath125 115@xmath126 and @xmath127 -25@xmath126 ) . also noteworthy",
    "is the cmd of a field that overlaps the triand2 region  field ( d ) in figure 4 of @xcite .",
    "although the density map for this field looks rather sparse , a diffuse ms still emerges , suggesting that triand2 covers a much larger extent on the sky than the mw stream ( as expected by the density maps in m giants shown in rp04 ) .",
    "lastly , the heliocentric radial velocities ( deimos / keck spectroscopy ) for eight stars that overlap in the cmd with the mw stream are clumped at @xmath128 km s@xmath48 .",
    "this signal is consistent with the range of radial velocities that we find in the region we studied that overlaps the pandas field ( see the black circles in the top panel of figure [ v4pan ] ) .",
    "this suggests that there may actually be an association between the mw stream and triand1 and/or triand2 .",
    "the recent work of deason et al .",
    "( 2014 ) further suggest a common origin between the triand1/triand2 features and the pandas mw stream .",
    "the discussion in the previous sections indicated that the current data are insufficient to rule out or confirm associations between the triand sequences and other features identified in the region ( for example gass ) , so we do not think we are yet in a position to present a definitive model of all structures in the region .",
    "instead we restrict our attention to exploring the specific class of models in which the triand sequences represent stellar debris from the disruption of a satellite galaxy .",
    "in particular , we show that a single satellite disruption is capable of simultaneously explaining what we consider to be the most robust observed properties of triand1 and triand2  the _ differences _ in their distances as well as the _ similarities _ in their sky coverage and velocity trends .",
    "( other scenarios are discussed in  [ limits ] . )",
    "debris from satellite disruption is most dense , and most likely to be found at the apocentric positions , where the stars spend most of their time .",
    "for the same reason , this is also the orbital phase where distinct debris populations lost on separate orbital passages are most likely to appear coincident on the sky . to investigate the plausibility of interpretating triand1 and triand2 as just such distinct debris populations from the same satellite , a series of simulations",
    "were run under the _ assumptions _ that : ( i ) the observed zero in line - of - sight velocities is indicative of debris sitting close to the orbital",
    "_ apocenter _ ( rather than pericenter ) ; and ( ii ) that the structure we observe represents debris leading the dead or dying satellite along its orbit .",
    "( note that the second assumption is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "however , if the structures were instead associated with trailing debris , then the leading counterparts would be mixed throughout the inner galaxy and the lack of prior detections in the literature would need to be explained . ) under these assumptions we can interpret the observed gradient in velocities as a signature of stars flowing away from us and slowing down towards the orbital apocenter . as a consequence , both the morphology in rp04 ( with an edge in density parallel to lines of constant galactic latitude ) and the sense of the gradient indicate that the debris should be moving predominantly in the direction of increasing galactic longitude ( i.e. , @xmath129 in the gsr frame , along a retrograde orbit ) , so we further assume no motion of the debris in the middle of the field in the direction of galactic latitude ( i.e. , @xmath130 ) .    figure [ sims1 ] summarizes the results for one such simulation of the disruption of a @xmath131 mass dwarf satellite system in orbit in a realistic milky way potential @xcite .",
    "the dwarf in the simulation was represented by a plummer model with scale - length 1.0 kpc , on an orbit of mild eccentricity with pericenters of @xmath132 kpc , apocenters @xmath133 kpc and radial time period of 0.7 gyr .",
    "the model does not contain separate representations of the dark and light matter within the dwarf , so the positions of the simulated particles outline the extent of stellar debris expected in each projection once the extended dark matter halo is stripped to this mass and a significant fraction of the stellar component is being lost . in particular , the original total mass of the dark matter halo could have been significantly larger .",
    "the left hand panel represents positions of particles projected onto the plane of the galactic disk , lost on the previous pericentric passage of the satellite ( blue ) and the orbit beforehand ( red ) .",
    "the cross indicates the position of the sun and the dotted lines show the limits of the survey ( i.e. , @xmath134 ) .",
    "the lower right hand panel of figure [ sims1 ] shows the positions of the red and blue particles projected onto the sky , demonstrating that the debris is in the appropriate location to represent triand .",
    "the upper right panel shows that this single model can reproduce the bimodal distance distribution apparent in the data by appealing to the differences in position at apocenter for debris lost on different pericentric passages , with the closer , denser triand1 corresponding to debris more recently lost .",
    "figure [ sims2 ] summarizes the results in velocity - space .",
    "the upper panel shows that both red and blue simulated sequences ( particles ) follow the same observed trend in @xmath4 ( triangles and error bars representing the average and dispersion of the observed m giants ) .",
    "the lower panels reveal systematic differences in tangential velocities between triand1 and triand2 , but these would be undetectable with the current accuracy of proper motions available .",
    "lastly , if the small abundance difference ( @xmath0 0.1 dex ) between triand1 and triand2 suggested by the isochrone fits of section [ iso ] is confirmed , this can quite easily be explained in this picture as being due to a mild metallicity gradient in the progenitor object .",
    "the red particles ( triand2 ) occupied radii with an average and dispersion of 1.20@xmath490.51 kpc within the model progenitor object used in the simulations , while the blue particles occupied radii with an average and dispersion of 0.95@xmath490.42 kpc .",
    "thus the required metallicity difference would require a negative gradient of @xmath0 0.5 dex kpc@xmath48 .",
    "gradients of this size have been seen in most sizeable dwarf spherical satellites of the milky way , including sculptor and leo ii ( see table 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , significant gradients in abundances have already been observed along the sagittarius stream @xcite .",
    "the model described above was selected after a modest exploration of parameter space with simulations where the tangential velocity in the region and total satellite mass were varied ( while keeping the density , and hence fractional mass - loss - rate , constant ) .",
    "overall , it was found that : ( i ) the mass of the satellite at the point when observed debris is lost must be @xmath0 a few @xmath135 to reproduce the width of the velocity distribution  masses a factor of 5 higher or lower are inconsistent with the data ; ( ii ) the tangential velocity of the debris must be @xmath136 km s@xmath48 to reproduce the observed moderate velocity gradient . in particular , note that the morphology of debris in the left - hand panel of figure [ sims1 ] is more stream - like ( continuous density along the orbit ) than cloud - like ( specific concentration of debris at apocenter ) .",
    "the latter `` cloud - like '' morphology only appeared when a strong velocity gradient was produced in the simulations due to the satellite disrupting on a much more eccentric orbit .",
    "while our model satisfactorily fits what we considered the most robust aspects of the current data ( i.e. positions and line - of - sight velocities ) , it is far from a unique solution .",
    "moreover , it is mildly inconsistent with the ( currently poor ) estimates of tangential velocities whose distribution appears skewed towards negative @xmath137 ( i.e. , prograde orbits ) . indeed , @xcite found debris in tidal disruption models with similar velocity sequences moving in the opposite sense around the galaxy . in this case",
    "the zero in @xmath4 in the debris occurs prior to the positive flow outwards along the orbit , so the debris would be at pericenter instead of apocenter .",
    "these _ prograde _ tidal disruption models are incapable of reproducing the distance offset between triand1 and triand2 during a single pericentric passage because the spatial distinction between debris lost on different passages is only apparent at apocenter .",
    "triand1 and triand2 could instead correspond to different debris wraps on separate passges , but then the exact coincidence in @xmath4 trends is hard to explain .",
    "this scenario could be conclusively distinguished from our own with more accurate assessments of the proper motions of stars in the region .",
    "a third possibility is to attempt to associate triand1 , triand2 and gass all with the galactic disk . in particular , it has been previously pointed out that the triand1 and triand2 velocity gradient fits smoothly onto that observed for gass at different galactic longitudes ( see rp04 ) , though gass has different stellar populations and lies much closer to the sun and the galactic plane",
    ". it would be interesting to explore whether all three features could simultaneously be produced by perturbing a self - gravitating disk system that includes a realistic population gradient .",
    "such models would produce structures on prograde orbits .",
    "we present an updated view of 2mass m giants in the triand region : we confirm additional members of the faint rgb sequence identified by @xcite and also identify a brighter rgb sequence , which we show to be likely associated with , but distinct spatially from , the faint rp04 sequence .",
    "the two distinct rgb features are directly compared with the two ms features detected by @xcite in the direction of andromeda ( triand1 and triand2 ) . by simultaneously fitting isochrones to the 2mass rgb features and the megacam ms features , we estimate the age , distance , and [ fe / h ] of each feature ; we find significant differences between the age and distance of the two features  the brighter , denser feature is younger and closer  and a slight difference ( on the order of 0.1 dex ) in the metallicities of the features . the fainter ms detected by @xcite is consistent with being the optical counterpart of the rgb sequence detected by rp04 .",
    "armed with our observed and derived properties of triand1 and triand2 , we explore one possible origin scenario where the structures represent debris from the disruption of a satellite galaxy .",
    "we find that a model with a progenitor satellite on a retrograde orbit that has been stripped over time to produce two distinct populations at the same orbital phase can explain the data . in these models , the triand feature is not morphologically a cloud but rather part of a more extended stream .",
    "the observed gradient in @xmath4 as a function of galactic longitude is not steep enough to produce cloud - like morphologies @xcite .",
    "of course , it remains unclear if this is the only solution , and the association with and the nature of other structures along this line - of - sight @xcite are still under scrutiny .",

    "<S> as large - scale stellar surveys have become available over the past decade , the ability to detect and characterize substructures in the galaxy has increased dramatically . </S>",
    "<S> these surveys have revealed the triangulum - andromeda ( triand ) region to be rich with substructure : along with an extension of the galactic anticenter stellar structure ( gass ; also known as the monoceros system ) at distances of @xmath0 10 kpc a number of features have been detected in this part of the sky in the distance range 20 - 30 kpc , and the relation of these features to each other  if any  remains unclear . </S>",
    "<S> this complex situation motivates this re - examination of the region with a photometric and spectroscopic survey of m giants . </S>",
    "<S> an exploration using 2mass photometry reveals not only the faint sequence in m giants detected by rocha - pinto et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2004 ) spanning the range @xmath1 and @xmath2 but , in addition , a second , brighter and more densely populated m giant sequence ( distinct from gass ) . </S>",
    "<S> these two sequences are likely associated with the two distinct main - sequences discovered ( and labeled triand1 and triand2 ) by martin et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2007 ) in an optical survey in the direction of m31 , where triand2 is the optical counterpart of the fainter rgb / agb sequence of rocha - pinto et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2004 ) . </S>",
    "<S> here , the age , distance , and metallicity ranges for triand1 and triand2 are estimated by simultaneously fitting isochrones to the 2mass rgb tracks and the optical ms / msto features . </S>",
    "<S> the two populations are clearly distinct in age and distance : the brighter sequence ( triand1 ) is younger ( 6 - 10 gyr ) and closer ( distance of @xmath0 15 - 21 kpc ) , while the fainter sequence ( triand2 ) is older ( 10 - 12 gyr ) and is at an estimated distance of @xmath0 24 - 32 kpc . the results also suggest a slight offset in metallicity . however , spectroscopic results reveal trends in radial velocity ( averages and dispersions ) as a function of galactic longitude that are _ identical _ for triand1 and triand2 . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with simulations demonstrates that the differences and similarities between triand1 and triand2 can simultaneously be explained if they represent debris originating from the disruption of the same dwarf galaxy , but torn off during two distinct pericentric passages . </S>"
