    "the curvature strain energy values are somewhat lower than the dft values , since energy penalties associated with bond stretching and bending do not appear in the continuum approach .",

    "we extend it from near - spherical fullerenes to nanotubes with cylindrical symmetry and schwarzites with local negative gaussian curvature .",

    "these results again indicate an excellent agreement between curvature energies in keating - optimized structures and dft - based strain energies .",
    "this agreement is particularly impressive , since the spread of atomic binding energies extends over more than 1  ev .",
    "as suggested at the outset , our approach to estimate relative stabilities is particularly valuable for unexplored systems such as monolayers of blue phosphorus,@xcite where model potentials have not yet been proposed .",
    "our dft - pbe results for a blue phosphorene monolayer indicate @xmath84  @xmath38 as the projected area per atom , @xmath85  ev and @xmath86 .",
    "the monolayer structure , shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , has an effective thickness of 1.27   .",
    "this structure can be rolled up to phosphorene nanotubes with different radii @xmath24 using the approach used in the construction of carbon nanotubes.@xcite as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , the strain energy for this geometry , obtained using continuum elasticity theory , agrees very well down to very small radii with results obtained using much more involved dft calculations.@xcite     ( bottom ) .",

    "the dashed line represents agreement between dft and continuum elasticity results.[fig5 ] ]",
    "given a set of points in space , such as atomic positions , it is possible to construct a smooth surface that contains all these points in order to characterize its shape everywhere , and to eventually determine the deformation energy using the continuum elasticity approach .",
    "we illustrate this point by tessellating the smooth surface of a graphitic nanocapsule , consisting of a cylinder capped by hemispheres at both ends and representing c@xmath88 , in different ways . our results in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] show that the average curvature energy @xmath89 is rather insensitive to the tessellation density .",
    "the horizontal dashed line at @xmath90  ev / @xmath38 , representing an extrapolation to a dense tessellation , is @xmath91% higher than the exact continuum elasticity value of @xmath92  ev / @xmath38 , obtained for an ideal capsule with cylinder and hemisphere radius @xmath93   .",
    "the small difference arises from our approximate way to estimate the mean curvature @xmath19 on the cylinder surface and at the interface between the cylinder and the hemisphere .",
    "the extrapolated value is also close to the @xmath94  ev / @xmath38 based on the dft - optimized c@xmath88 capsule .     per area of a nanocapsule tessellated by a honeycomb lattice with different numbers of vertices .",
    "the vertical dash - dotted red line indicates that the capsule represents the c@xmath88 structure .",
    "the inset shows , how the capsule surface can be tessellated by a honeycomb lattice with 120 vertices or atoms , shown by the white lines , and also with 480 vertices , shown by the red lines .",
    "the horizontal dashed black line represents an extrapolation to an infinitely dense tessellation .",
    "[ fig6 ] ]    the reverse process to determine atomic positions from the shape alone is not unique .",
    "an informative example is the structure of a carbon nanotube .",
    "whereas the precise atomic structure within each nanotube is defined by the chiral index , many nanotubes with different chiral indices share essentially the same diameter and the same local curvature .",
    "thus , given only the diameter of a ( wide ) hollow cylinder representing a nanotube , it is impossible to uniquely identify the chiral index and thus the atomic position . as a matter of fact ,",
    "identifying the precise atomic positions is not necessary , since according to continuum elasticity theory , supported by experimental evidence , the stability of nanotubes depends only on the tube diameter.@xcite    from its construction , the continuum elasticity description of local and global stability is best suited for very large structures with small local curvatures .",
    "therefore , the high level of agreement between its predictions and _ ab initio _ results in structures with large local curvatures is rather impressive . among the different allotropes , we find the continuum elasticity description to be most accurate for carbon nanotubes , where all bond lengths are at their equilibrium value . in fullerenes and schwarzites ,",
    "the presence of non - hexagonal rings , including pentagons and heptagons , prevents a global optimization of bond lengths and bond angles , reducing the agreement with dft results .",
    "our stability results are consistent with the pentagon adjacency rule that provides an energy penalty of @xmath95  ev for each pair of adjacent pentagons , which causes an increase of the local curvature .",
    "while this rule is surely useful , it can not compare the stability of isomers with isolated pentagons or structures of different size .",
    "what we consider the most significant benefit of our approach to determine local strain@xcite is to identify the least stable sites in a structure . local curvature and in - plane strain play the key role in both local stability and local electronic structure,@xcite which also controls the chemical reactivity",
    "thus , our approach can identify the most reactive and the least stable sites , which control the stability of the entire system . +",
    "in conclusion , we have introduced a fast method to determine the local curvature in 2d systems with arbitrary shape .",
    "the curvature information , combined with elastic constants obtained for a planar system , provides an accurate estimate of the local stability in the framework of continuum elasticity theory .",
    "relative stabilities of graphitic structures including fullerenes , nanotubes and schwarzites , as well as phosphorene nanotubes calculated using this approach , agree closely with _",
    "ab initio _ density functional calculations",
    ". the continuum elasticity approach can be applied to all 2d structures and is particularly attractive in complex systems with known structure , where the quality of parameterized force fields has not been established .",
