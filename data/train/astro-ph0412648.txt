    "recently , there has been a great progress in observational studies of structures of the high - redshift universe . @xcite found a proto - cluster at @xmath7 with a large population of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "a significant excess of ly@xmath2 emitters ( laes ) was found by @xcite around a radio galaxy at @xmath8 , and a subsequent study concluded that this excess is indeed a proto - cluster with a size of @xmath9 mpc @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite reported clustering of 6 laes near a radio galaxy at @xmath10 . for structures beyond cluster scales , wide - field narrow - band surveys revealed very inhomogeneous distribution of laes @xcite at @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite report an elongated overdense region of laes at @xmath12 on the sky of 20 mpc in width and 50 mpc in length .",
    "however , on the same sky , @xcite found no large - scale structure at @xmath13 which is closer to us by 39 mpc , indicating a large cosmic variance over their surveyed volumes .",
    "although a few segments of high-@xmath14 structures have been found to date , the whole picture of high-@xmath14 universe is veiled .",
    "moreover , we do not know when and how the structures of galaxies seen at present formed from the initial matter density fluctuations .",
    "we started a systematic survey to map the high-@xmath14 universe with laes and lbgs at @xmath15 in the 1 deg@xmath1 sky of the subaru / xmm - newton deep field ( sxdf : r.a.@xmath16 , decl.@xmath17[j2000 ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "we obtained cosmic maps on scales of much larger than present - day lsss to cover a network of lsss at several redshifts between @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in this letter , we report the initial results of our survey about structures made of laes at @xmath0 . throughout this paper , we adopt @xmath20 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 and @xmath22=[0.3,0.7,1.0,0.9]$ ] .",
    "we carried out extensive deep narrow - band imaging on 2003 september 27 - 30 and october 22 with subaru / suprime - cam @xcite .",
    "we used the narrow - band filter @xmath23 whose central wavelength and fwhm are @xmath24  and 120 , respectively @xcite .",
    "this filter enables us to identify laes , galaxies with a strong ly@xmath2 emission line , at @xmath25 with a small fraction of foreground contaminants ( 20 - 30% ; e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our 20-hour exposure imaging covered an area of 1.04 deg@xmath1 with 5 suprime - cam pointings .",
    "the sky was clear and the observational conditions were stable , with typical seeing sizes of @xmath26 .",
    "the data were reduced with a software package sdfred @xcite .",
    "the sky noise of the reduced image is @xmath27 ( ab ) at the @xmath28 level with a @xmath29-diameter circular aperture .",
    "we detected 305,012 objects down to @xmath30 with sextractor @xcite and measured their narrow - band excess color ( @xmath31 ) and continuum color ( @xmath32 ) by combining existing very deep @xmath33- and @xmath34-band images of the sxdf ( see @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : cc_nb816_modelobj ] shows the two color diagram of @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the @xmath23 detected objects , together with colors of model galaxies and galactic stars . in figure",
    "[ fig : cc_nb816_modelobj ] , model laes at @xmath0 have very red colors both in @xmath31 and @xmath32 because of a strong ly@xmath2 emission line and a continuum trough at @xmath35 , which are distinguished from colors of foreground objects .",
    "we defined the criteria for @xmath25 laes as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and selected 515 laes from all the detected objects .",
    "these selection criteria isolate emission line objects with an observed - frame equivalent width of @xmath38  and a line flux of @xmath39 erg s@xmath21 @xmath40 , if a flat continuum spectrum is assumed .",
    "the contamination rate of our lae sample is estimated to be about 30% based on our spectroscopic follow - up observations described in section 3.2 .",
    "the surface density and number density of these 515 laes are estimated to be @xmath41 arcmin@xmath42 and @xmath43 mpc@xmath44 .",
    "we also calculate the surface density down to the same magnitude limit as @xcite ( @xmath45 ) and obtain @xmath46 arcmin@xmath42 which is consistent with that of @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : density_cont_nb816_2 ] is the cosmic map showing the distribution of 515 laes at @xmath0 in the sxdf .",
    "the surveyed volume has a transverse dimension of 180 mpc @xmath3 180 mpc and a depth of @xmath4 mpc in comoving units .",
    "this is the first cosmic map , ever obtained , covering a @xmath47 mpc square area of the universe at any high redshifts ( @xmath48 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : density_cont_nb816_2 ] , the laes have a very clumpy distribution , forming concentrations with a typical size of a few mpc , comparable in size to the proto - cluster found by @xcite .",
    "these concentrations are not isolated , but connected with one another by filamentary overdense regions .",
    "the elongated overdense region of laes found by @xcite at @xmath12 may be a segment of a descendant of such a filamentary structure .",
    "there are also found several voids of ellipsoidal shapes with sizes of 10 - 40 mpc in which almost no galaxy exists .",
    "the characteristic sizes of filaments and voids seen in our map are comparable to those of the present - day universe .",
    "thus , this map marks the discovery of primeval lsss at @xmath0 .",
    "we quantify the large - scale clumpiness of the galaxy distribution by estimating @xmath49 , the rms fluctuation of galaxy overdensity within a sphere of 20 mpc ( comoving ) radius .",
    "considering that the radial depth of the surveyed volume is about 40 mpc , we estimate the fluctuation by @xmath50/ \\bar{\\sigma}_{20}^2 $ ] , where @xmath51 is the rms surface overdensity within circles of 20 mpc radius , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the observed number and the mean number of laes in a circle @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath54 .",
    "this @xmath49 is comparable to or at least a half the value for the present - day lsss , i.e. @xmath55 , obtained from galaxies with @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the characteristic shapes and the rms fluctuations indicate that these primeval lsss at @xmath57 are similar to the present - day lsss .",
    "we will present results of more detailed analyses for these primeval lsss , such as counts - in - cell , in our forthcoming paper .",
    "we find that among the dense concentrations seen in figure [ fig : density_cont_nb816_2 ] , the one at @xmath58 , @xmath59[j2000 ] has the highest density contrast , @xmath60 , with the @xmath61 significance level , where @xmath62 is the surface overdensity for a circle of 8 mpc radius .",
    "we refer to this concentration as region a. region b , a neighboring concentration at @xmath63,@xmath64[j2000 ] , also has a high density contrast of @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) . in order to obtain three - dimensional distributions of laes in regions",
    "a and b , we carried out spectroscopy for laes with subaru / focas @xcite on 2003 december 20 , 23 , and 25 .",
    "we placed a slit mask on each region .",
    "another mask was put on a control field well separated from regions a and b. we made a 2-hour exposure for each mask , and obtained 22 spectra in total , whose spectral range and resolution are @xmath67=4900 - 9400  and @xmath68 , respectively . among the 22 objects , we classify one as an [ oiii ] emitter at @xmath69 , two as [ oii ] emitters at @xmath70 , and eight as securely identified laes with a characteristic asymmetric feature in ly@xmath2 line whose skewness exceeds 1.5 with the @xmath71 level .",
    "we show spectra of these emitters in figure [ fig : spec_disp_paper ] .",
    "since we have eight secure laes among the 11 ( = 8 + 2 + 1 ) identified objects , we estimate the contamination rate of our lae sample to be about 30% , which is consistent with those of other lae samples @xcite .",
    "the other 11 objects out of the 22 are emitters with an unresolved - single line at @xmath72 .",
    "since most unresolved - single line emitters have been found to be laes with a moderate velocity dispersion ( @xmath73 km s@xmath21 ; @xcite ) , we also regard these 11 objects as laes .",
    "thus we have 19 laes with spectroscopic redshifts as summarized in table [ tab : lae_spec ] .",
    "we plot in figure [ fig : threedmap_sxdss_plushist ] the three - dimensional distribution of laes for regions a and b. the histogram of figure [ fig : threedmap_sxdss_plushist ] shows that these regions have two clumps made of 10 laes with a significant excess .",
    "each of the clumps has a diameter of about 1 mpc in physical units ( 7 mpc in comoving units ) . for these clumps ,",
    "the 1-dimensional velocity dispersion of galaxies is fairly small , @xmath74 km s@xmath21 ( clump a ) and @xmath75 km s@xmath21 ( b ) .",
    "although these clumps may not be collapsed , the formal virial masses can be calculated from velocity dispersion , @xmath76 , and radius , @xmath77 , with @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the gravitational constant .",
    "we obtain @xmath80 ( clump a ) and @xmath81 ( b ) .",
    "the three - dimensional density contrast of laes , @xmath82 , for the average of these clumps is @xmath6 , which is comparable to those of present - day clusters , @xmath83 .",
    "these clumps have the highest density in our surveyed volume of @xmath84 mpc@xmath85 in comoving units . in the present - day universe , this volume typically contains two massive clusters with mass of @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "thus , the discovered clumps are likely proto - clusters which are ancestors of today s such clusters .",
    "a particularly interesting feature is that these clumps are very high concentrations of star - forming galaxies with a star - formation rate of @xmath87 yr@xmath21 .",
    "the star - formation rate density ( sfrd ) in these clumps inferred from ly@xmath2 fluxes is about 130 times higher than in the mean of the whole 1 deg@xmath1 field , mainly due to a large overdensity , @xmath88 , of laes .",
    "this very high sfrd implies that these clumps would be just producing a number of galaxies in a short period by a burst of galaxy formation .",
    "in contrast , present - day massive clusters are dominated by old early - type galaxies , and show a deficit of young star - forming galaxies @xcite . since the formation epochs of early - type galaxies are estimated to be @xmath89 or earlier ( e.g. @xcite ) , galaxies residing in these clumps are likely progenitors of the old early types seen in the core of present - day clusters .",
    "therefore , we are probably witnessing forming clusters where a number of present - day early - type galaxies are just emerging as star - forming galaxies by a burst of galaxy formation .",
    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model , the standard hierarchical scenario , predicts that very small initial fluctuations of mass density grow up gradually with time to evolve into galaxies and lsss .",
    "however , the observed distribution of laes appears much more inhomogeneous than the dark - matter distribution , since the amplitude of the matter fluctuations at @xmath0 is predicted to be only 1/5 of the current value .",
    "if one wants to accept the cdm model , a solution to this discrepancy is to assume that laes are biased tracers of mass in a way to enhance the mass fluctuations .",
    "previous observational studies of high-@xmath14 galaxies discuss the clustering bias @xcite .",
    "theoretically , such biasing can be produced , if galaxies are formed at rare , highest peaks of yet small fluctuations of matter density ( e.g. @xcite ) . from @xmath49",
    ", we estimate that the bias parameter , @xmath90 , the ratio of galaxy overdensity to matter overdensity , is @xmath91 on scales of lsss ( 20 mpc ) , which is comparable to the prediction at @xmath92 from simulations of galaxy formation based on the cdm model @xcite .",
    "thus , the cdm model may be consistent with the early formation of lsss that we discovered , though the model needs to reproduce the characteristic shapes of observed lsss , long filaments and large voids .",
    "on the other hand , we estimate the @xmath90 value , in the cdm , which reproduces the observed number of forming clusters ( two in @xmath84 mpc@xmath85 ) with the size and the overdensity , @xmath88 , following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath93 for the two forming clusters , which is about ten times higher than the value for lss scales , although this estimation of @xmath90 is based on small statistics and might include a large error due to cosmic variance .",
    "this variety of @xmath90 could be due to the dependence of @xmath90 on the clustering scale or galaxy density @xcite .",
    "however , it is not yet clear how such a large difference in @xmath90 may be produced within the framework of the cdm model .",
    "our cosmic map may raise a question about how and where galaxies are formed in the early universe .",
