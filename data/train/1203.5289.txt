    "deterministic filtering approaches @xcite have been studied as an alternative to stochastic methods of filtering .",
    "these deterministic methods are especially appealing in cases where the disturbance statistics are not known apriori . in fact , this approach has been successfully applied across various domains - quantitative finance , attitude estimation @xcite , etc .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the case of linear systems with gaussian white noise disturbances / measurement noise , both these approaches yield the same solution ( the kalman filter obtained as the solution to the associated riccati equation ) : a required feature of any optimal filtering method .",
    "the design of deterministic filters proceeds by casting the filtering problem as a optimal control problem on the system with dynamics that are time reversed ( with respect to the original system ) .",
    "solving the optimal control problem using the dynamic programming method gives rise to an associated partial differential equation ( the hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equation ) . for systems with nonlinear dynamics / output equations",

    "these ideas were introduced for filtering in nonlinear systems in @xcite where the basis used are in the ( semi - convex ) dual space ( obtained via the fenchel transform ) . in that work ,",
    "the value function was transformed into this space via the fenchel transform and a fixed ( albeit possible countably infinite ) set of basis functions were chosen in this dual space .",
    "_ this is in contrast to the approach herein where we use a set of convex functions that are not fixed across different time steps_. more recently @xcite developed a related approach using a different representation in terms of semi - convex function basis .",
    "this was termed curse of dimensionality free methods and have been utilized in areas such as quantum control @xcite , deception games @xcite .",
    "recent work @xcite introduced the application of these methods in the context of deterministic filtering for nonlinear systems .",
    "such idempotent methods have also been applied in other areas @xcite . in this article",
    "we describe the design / implementation of the min - plus technique for deterministic filter design . of specific novelty ,",
    "are the approaches used to help handle the growth in the number of basis elements used to represent the value function as new measurements are made and state estimates are updated .    the outline of the article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secproblemformulation ] we introduce the problem of interest and proceed to describe ( in sec .

    "this step involves obtaining a quadratic approximation ( in a min - plus sense ) to the terms used in ( specifically and ) .",
    "the quadratic terms thus obtained are used to carry out the recursion step which yields the quadratic approximation for the value function at the next time step .",
    "a quadratic approximation of a ( continuous ) function @xmath34 over a set @xmath35 using a set of @xmath36 quadratics is performed as follows .",
    "note that this window @xmath35 is a set centered around @xmath29 i.e. , the optimal state estimate available at that time step . given a set of points @xmath37",

[ combinequadratics ] to the set of quadratics above we generate an index set @xmath58 and a set of quadratics @xmath59 such that holds .",
    "it can be seen that the construction of new quadratics leads to a growth in the number of such terms used to represent the value function . hence in order to facilitate numerical tractability it becomes essential to reduce the number of such quadratics without unduly sacrificing estimation accuracy .",
    "this pruning  is , in effect , a projection of an initially large set @xmath60 of quadratics ( min - plus basis elements ) into a lower dimensional / lower cardinality set @xmath61 for the min - plus expansion of the value function .",
    "n intuitive approach to pruning in the application of the max / min plus techniques in control , involves assigning a metric which indicates the contribution of each quadratic to the minimization of the value function .",
    "however in the filtering case such an approach can give rise to a non - robust filter .",
    "for instance figure [ needforclustering ] depicts a situation where the contribution of the set @xmath62 of quadratics to the minimization is much greater than that of the quadratics in set @xmath63 .",
    "however in terms of robustness , if only set @xmath62 was retained , it would cause the filter to respond more slowly to large jumps in the system state .",
    "for instance , an output corresponding to the state @xmath64 would not lead to the desired state update from @xmath65 since all the quadratics around the state @xmath64 would have been pruned away .",
    "these situations of a jump in the state , arise in important applications in bimodal / multimodal oscillators , systems with binary or jump disturbances in the state .",
    "hence an alternative pruning approach is required in order to increase the robustness of the filter .",
    "one such pruning method is a clustering approach . in this technique we cluster ( spatially ) the @xmath66 the estimated state for each quadratic @xmath67 in the original set @xmath60 .",
    "then , given a requirement to retain only @xmath68 of these quadratics , we generate @xmath68 clusters and choose the quadratics with the best contribution metric ( i.e. the ones which yield the most likely state ) _ from within each cluster_. this proceeds as follows    1 .   for all @xmath69 , obtain the corresponding @xmath70 .",
    "note : due to the presence of a window of interest , the argmin might differ from the analytically obtained minima for the quadratic ( which might lie outside the region of interest ) .",
    "now we cluster this set ( say @xmath71 ) of the estimates @xmath66 such that every @xmath72 belongs to a cluster @xmath73 , i.e. , the we generate a cluster map @xmath74 which returns a cluster number for each element of @xmath71 ( based on the metric chosen to separate the estimates into clusters ) .",
    "3 .   within each cluster",
    "we sort and retain the quadratic that has the greatest contribution to the minimization of the value function .",
    "hence the set of quadratics to be retained is defined as @xmath75    for a visual intuition of this pruning approach , ref fig .  [ quadplotclustering ] .",
    "this procedure yields the desired projection set @xmath76 of quadratics , starting from the original set @xmath60 .",
