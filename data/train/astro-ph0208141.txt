    "two of the most fundamental and intriguing questions in astronomy are how galaxies form and how they evolve with time . in order to answer these questions",
    ", we must be able to compare and contrast the properties of galaxies at different redshifts . whereas we have a wealth of information about galaxies at z @xmath14 1.0 ,",
    "our knowledge of the properties of galaxies at higher redshifts is limited .",
    "however , with the advent of the hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ) project @xcite , we can probe to fainter surface brightness limits and smaller angular scales than before , the sizes , shapes , and colors of distant galaxies which will ultimately yield important clues to understanding their structure , formation , and subsequent evolution .",
    "the near - infrared data from nicmos combined with the optical data from wfpc-2 give us the unique opportunity to compare the surface brightness properties of galaxies at the same rest - frame wavelengths over a range of redshifts allowing us to better understand galaxy formation and evolution from an observational standpoint .",
    "one observational test of galaxy evolution is the study of color profiles which will give us an idea of the distribution of stellar populations in the galaxies and whether this distribution changes with time . due to limits in resolution , the study of the color profiles of galaxies have been predominantly restricted to the low and intermediate redshift regimes .",
    "however , the deep , high resolution , multi - wavelength data from the hdf - n probed in this study provides us with the rare opportunity to study the color profiles of galaxies at higher redshifts than those studied in the past .",
    "previous studies of early - type galaxies at z @xmath14 1.0 have shown that they tend to have redder colors in their central regions and gradually become bluer outwards @xcite .",
    "this trend in the color profiles can be explained by either a stellar age or metallicity gradient which become degenerate at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "most studies concur that models involving the metallicity gradient best reproduce the color gradients seen in early - type galaxies at z @xmath14 1.0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the gradients observed in late - type galaxies may be due to both age and metallicity effects , i.e. , the central parts of the galaxies in general have older stars and higher metallicity than the outer parts making them have redder colors towards the centers . in their study of the near - ir and optical color profiles of 86 face - on disk dominated galaxies , @xcite concluded that their color gradients were best reproduced by models involving both stellar age and metallicity gradients .",
    "the existence or lack of dust in galaxies can also complicate matters and must be addressed when interpreting color profiles since , in theory , dust may also be responsible for the central reddening in galaxies if we assume that dust generally tends to be more concentrated in the center and consequently would produce more extinction there @xcite .    a study of the color profiles and surface brightness profiles of galaxies spanning a wide range of redshifts will help us place constraints on galaxy formation and evolution by enabling us to compare what we learn from observations with what we predict from theoretical models . currently , the hierarchical structure formation model @xcite represents the popular framework for how structure formed and evolved in the universe .",
    "this model assumes that the universe is dominated by nonbaryonic dark matter which only interacts with visible matter through its gravitational influence and ultimately determines where galaxies will form .",
    "it predicts that the gravitational perturbations in the early universe will cause the smallest mass fluctuations to collapse first and then to subsequently merge into progressively larger structures until they form the mature galaxies we observe today .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter bcfl ) analyzed the properties of the high redshift lyman break galaxies in the context of this model .",
    "in their semi - analytic treatment of galaxy formation in hierarchical clustering theories , they generated mock catalogs of the high redshift lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) using the color criterion imposed by @xcite and modeled the growth of dark matter haloes by the accretion of matter through mergers taking into account the cooling of gas into stars and feedback .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter spf ) also applied semi - analytic models of galaxy formation within the hierarchical clustering framework to analyze the population of lyman break galaxies at high redshift .",
    "since they conveniently address the properties of lyman break galaxies ( the sample of significant interest to us ) within the current popular framework for galaxy formation and evolution , we will interpret our results within the context of the bcfl and spf models .",
    "it is important to study the properties of the galaxies at different redshifts at the same rest - frame wavelengths because some galaxies might experience what is called `` morphological k - corrections '' .",
    "this is a phenomena which occurs when galaxies at different redshifts look different when viewed through the same passband since the passband would represent different rest - frame wavelengths .",
    "for example , the @xmath2 image for a galaxy at redshift @xmath16 would reflect the properties of the galaxy at the rest optical wavelengths whose light would include both young and old stellar populations , whereas for a galaxy at redshift @xmath17 , the @xmath2 image would represent the rest - uv wavelengths of the galaxy which is dominated by the younger , bluer stellar populations .",
    "thus , if we want to compare the properties of the same stellar populations , we need to choose our passbands such that they reflect the same rest wavelengths at all redshifts .    the original hdf - n data was a director s discretionary program on hst designed to image a field at high galactic latitude using the wfpc-2 camera in four passbands spanning the wavelengths @xmath18 @xmath19 m @xcite . at low redshifts ,",
    "these images were sufficient to study the galaxies in the rest - frame optical wavelengths , however at z @xmath20 1 , the wfpc-2 images could only be used to study the rest ultraviolet properties of the galaxies since their rest optical wavelengths were shifted into the near - ir . near - ir data of galaxies in the hdf - n were available from ground - based observations @xcite . however , since the ground - based data were taken at much lower resolution ( @xmath21 1 @xmath22 ) and reached shallower depths than did the wfpc-2 images , it was very difficult to compare the properties of high redshift galaxies with their lower redshift counterparts at the same rest - frame wavelengths . to address this problem , @xcite , embarked on a general observer s ( go ) program 7817 to image the entire wfpc-2 region of the hdf - n in the near - ir using the nicmos camera 3 f110w and f160w filters .",
    "the data reached an average depth of @xmath23 in f110w and f160w with a signal - to - noise ratio of 10 in 0.@xmath227 diameter aperture and has a psf of @xmath24@xmath25 after the dithered data was combined by drizzling . to avoid the morphological k - correction problem",
    ", we study the intermediate redshift galaxies in the hdf - n using the wfpc-2 images taken in f450w ( @xmath26 ) , f606w ( @xmath27 ) and f814w ( @xmath2 ) and the high redshift galaxies using wfpc-2 f814w ( @xmath2 ) and the nicmos cam3 images taken in f110w ( @xmath28 ) and f160w ( @xmath5 ) in order to probe their rest - frame near - uv and optical properties .",
    "since we will be comparing the color profiles of galaxies at a range of redshifts , it is important to establish what we mean by intermediate and high redshift galaxies .",
    "we will define _ intermediate redshift   galaxies as those having redshifts between 0.5 @xmath14 z @xmath14 1.2 and _ high redshift  galaxies as those having redshifts between 2.0 @xmath14 z @xmath14 3.5 .",
    "we do not include galaxies with 1.2 @xmath14 z @xmath14 2.0 in our sample because at these redshifts , there are no prominent optical features to constrain the redshifts with the high precision required in our study .",
    "our sample consists of 33 intermediate redshift galaxies with @xmath2 @xmath3 25 identified by spectroscopic redshifts @xcite and 50 high redshift galaxies with @xmath5 @xmath3 27 , of which 25 were identified by spectroscopic redshifts @xcite and 25 by photometric redshifts @xcite . in our paper",
    ", we assume a cosomology where @xmath29 and @xmath30 . _ _",
    "we performed detailed surface photometry on our sample of galaxies using the ellipse task in the iraf / stsdas package .",
    "this task fits elliptical isophotes to the galaxies using the iterative scheme described in @xcite .",
    "we entered inital guesses for the ellipse center ( _ x , y ) , ellipticity ( _ e ) , and position angle ( @xmath31 ) and allowed the task to update these parameters following the iteration scheme . the errors in the azimuthally averaged intensity are obtained from the rms scatter of the intensity measurements along each fitted isophote . in order to generate color profiles , it was important that we kept the ellipses fixed between the different filters since positional displacement of the isophotes in the different filters may cause the color distribution of the galaxy to be artificially asymmetric . thus , we combined the images taken in different passbands , fitted ellipses to the combined image , and then used the set of ellipses generated from the combined image as the input ellipses for no - fit mode on each individual image . in this way , we made sure that the surface brightness profiles from the different bands were generated using the same fitted ellipses .",
    "it is also important that the psfs between the different filters match .",
    "this was accomplished by degrading the @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath2 , and @xmath28 images to match the resolution of the @xmath5 image .",
    "the psf matching was verified by looking for color gradients in stellar profiles .",
    "many of the galaxies , especially at high redshifts , possessed nearby companions . in order to perform the fits only on the galaxy of interest , we masked out the companion .",
    "we then converted all fluxes to ab magnitudes .",
    "_ _      from the elliptical isophotes , we produced azimuthally averaged radial surface brightness profiles . for our intermediate redshift sample , we produced surface brightness profiles of the images taken in @xmath2 , while for the high redshift sample , we produced surface brightness profiles for the images taken in @xmath5 . at the respective redshifts of the galaxies ,",
    "these images represent approximately their rest - frame b wavelengths .",
    "we analyzed the resulting intensity distribution using the stsdas task nfit1d to perform @xmath32 fitting to the surface brightness profiles .",
    "normally we would fit the profiles with the sum of an @xmath13 bulge @xcite and an exponential disk @xcite profile .",
    "however , for most of the galaxies , especially at high redshifts , the scale lengths of the galaxies were so small and severely affected by psf smearing that it was difficult to obtain reliable fits using these profiles .",
    "thus , we decided to fit the radial light profiles with a generalized exponential @xcite : @xmath33\\ ] ] where _",
    "r(e )  is the half - light radius , _",
    "s(e )  is the flux at _ r(e ) , @xmath34 is the surface brightness at r , and _",
    "n  is the srsic index which tells us about the degree of flattening in the profile ( @xmath35 recovers the exponential disk profile and @xmath36 recovers the @xmath13 law ) . @xcite",
    "have applied an analytic approach to study the effects of the psf on the srsic profiles .",
    "they found that , of the free parameters in the srsic profile , the one that is affected most by the psf is @xmath37 which is smaller in the observed profile than in the actual profile .",
    "furthermore , the higher the original value of @xmath37 is , the more it will be affected by the psf . at the faint magnitudes and small scale lengths of typical high redshift galaxies in the hdf - n",
    ", we will show that the psf can potentially flatten both an exponential and an @xmath13 profile into a srsic profile with _",
    "n  @xmath3 1 .",
    "it then becomes challenging to distinguish between galaxies having exponential profiles from those having de vaucouleurs profiles .",
    "the next section explains our attempts to understand the effects of the psf on the surface brightness profiles in order to more accurately classify morphologies .",
    "_ _ _ _ _      in order to account for the effects of the psf on the data , we created model galaxies and convolved them with the psf to match the resolution of the data . to reproduce the surface brightness profiles of the intermediate redshift sample , we created 10 galaxies with exponential disk profiles ( @xmath38 ) and 10 with @xmath13 ( @xmath39 ) bulge profiles with varying half - light radii and @xmath2 magnitudes = 21 , 22 , 23 , and 24 ( this spans the range of magnitudes in our intermediate redshift sample ) for a total of 80 galaxies . since the wfpc-2 and nicmos images have all been degraded to match the resolution of the @xmath5 passband , we convolved the model galaxies with an isolated , unsaturated star taken from this passband .",
    "we performed the convolution using the iraf task fconvolve which takes the fourier transform of the model galaxy and the psf ( normalized to conserve flux ) , multiplies them together , and then takes the inverse transform of the product to produce the final convolved galaxy .",
    "we then added the model galaxies onto blank areas of the sky in the hdf @xmath2 image . by doing so",
    ", we include the contribution of the background noise which exists in the image .",
    "however , we have chosen to neglect the poisson noise from the galaxies themselves since it will be negligible compared to the background noise . to simulate our high redshift sample , we repeated the process but added the model galaxies onto blank areas of the hdf @xmath5 image with @xmath5 magnitudes = 23 and 24 .",
    "we then generated surface brightness profiles and fit srsic profiles to the convolved disk and spheroid galaxies in order to determine the degree of flattening due to the psf .",
    "tables 1 and 2 lists the half - light radii and the srsic indices of the convolved model galaxies with a range of magnitudes in the @xmath2 and @xmath5 passbands respectively . from tables 1 and 2 , we can see that after convolution with the psf , the profiles of all the galaxies are significantly flattened , i.e. their srsic index @xmath37 decreased significantly from the original profile ( recall that @xmath35 for disks and @xmath36 for spheroids ) .",
    "in fact , table 1 shows that after convolution with the psf , the srsic indices of the mock intermediate redshift galaxies originally possessing an @xmath13 profile can drop all the way to a value of 1 which is indicative of an exponential profile .",
    "table 2 shows an even more drastic drop in srsic indices of the mock high redshift galaxies after they had been convolved with the psf of the hdf . at these small scale lengths and faint magnitudes typical of the high redshift galaxies in our sample , the srsic indices of the model spheroids drop to 1 and below rendering them almost indistinguishable from the model disks .",
    "furthermore , the smaller the galaxy is , the more the value of @xmath37 decreases for both the disk and bulge models .",
    "consequently it would be very difficult to determine from the convolved profile whether it originally possessed an exponential or an @xmath13 profile .",
    "fortunately , trends exist which allow us to reliably distinguish between the two types of galaxies even after they have been significantly flattened by the psf .",
    "we notice that at a given radius and magnitude both profiles are severely smoothed out , but that @xmath37 for the spheroid is always higher than @xmath37 for the disk , i.e. the disk has a more flattened profile .",
    "for example , at @xmath2 = 21 and half - light radius of approximately 0.@xmath2284 , @xmath37 for the spheroid is 1.736 whereas @xmath37 for the disk is 0.789 ( table 1 ) which is significantly lower .",
    "this trend occurs at all radii and magnitudes .",
    "thus , although the surface brightness profiles of the galaxies in the hdf - n are significantly affected by the psf , we can still broadly classify galaxies morphologically by comparing the value of @xmath37 and the half - light radii of these galaxies at a given magnitude with those of our model galaxies .",
    "however , caution must be taken when using this method to classify the morphologies of galaxies with half - light radii less than @xmath40 since it would be pushing the resolution limit of the instrument and , consequently , the results would not be reliable .",
    "fortunately , there are no galaxies in our sample where this is the case .",
    "we must also note that in our high redshift sample , we can only reliably classify the morphologies of galaxies with magnitudes less than @xmath5 = 24.5 since , at fainter magnitudes , the srsic indices of a disk and spheroid at a given radius is within the range of the scatter .",
    "we must keep in mind also that our galaxy classification scheme is not intended to be used to classify galaxies on a case by case basis , but rather to obtain statistics about the galaxy population as a whole .",
    "we determined the color profiles of the galaxies by subtracting the surface brightness profile of one passband from the surface brightness profile of the adjacent passband . for our intermediate redshift sample ,",
    "we generated @xmath41 color profiles , and for our high redshift samples , we produced @xmath42 color profiles .",
    "we then applied k - corrections described in the following section to transform them to their rest - frame @xmath0 colors where uv @xmath21 2192   and u @xmath21 2943  .",
    "the k - corrections applied are minimal since we have chosen to work with passbands which closely map to their rest - frame wavelengths .",
    "we then performed a weighted least - squares fit to the profile .",
    "we started the fit 0.14  out from the center of the profile since the color differences near the center might reflect slight differences in the psf between the two passbands rather than indicate true color changes in the galaxy . from the fits",
    ", we were able to obtain the value of the color gradient ( @xmath7/@xmath8log(r ) ) where @xmath0 is the rest - frame color and r is the radius in kpc .",
    "the main source of error in this procedure is the uncertainty in the determination of the local sky background values",
    ". the global sky background subtraction might be adequate for the larger and brighter galaxies in our intermediate redshift sample , but for the smaller and fainter galaxies in our high redshift sample , there could be residuals in the background which could significantly change the value and even the sign of the color gradient if the effect is huge .",
    "we determined the value of the local sky background by extending the elliptical isophotes out past five scale lengths in 0.12  increments taking care to mask out nearby objects .",
    "we then adopted the value of our background as the typical value of the isophotes located far enough from the object such that the flux level ceased to decrease steadily , but instead fluctuated around some value . from this method , we found that in general there had been an overestimation in the global background value in the reduced images used for this study .      when we observe two galaxies at different distances with the same intrinsic brightness through the same passband , we will measure two different magnitudes not only because of the inverse square law , but also because their spectral energy distributions ( sed ) will be shifted towards longer wavelengths and also `` stretched '' by a factor of @xmath43 due to the expansion of the universe . in order to correct for this effect and to convert the color profiles to their rest - frame values",
    ", we need to apply k - corrections to our results .",
    "we use the definition of the k - correction from @xcite : @xmath44\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the sensitivity function of the detector i , @xmath46 is the observed energy flux density , @xmath47 is the energy flux density of the galaxy at rest , @xmath48 is the bandwidth of the detector _ i , and @xmath49 is the k - correction of the galaxy observed through detector _",
    "i  at redshift z. the first term of the correction is due to the `` stretching '' of the passband whereas the second term represents the shifting of the sed to longer wavelengths . _ _    since k",
    "- corrections do not currently exist for the nicmos passbands , we generated our own set by using the seds from @xcite .",
    "they used the stardust model to produce seds for 17 galaxies ranging from local spirals , starbursts , luminous infrared galaxies , and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) extending from the far - uv to sub - mm wavelengths .",
    "their seds also included the effects of internal extinction and emission of dust in the galaxies .",
    "in the process of analyzing the color profiles of the galaxies , we also studied their surface brightness profiles .",
    "tables 3 and 4 list the statistics for the 33 galaxies in the intermediate redshift and 50 galaxies in the high redshift regime respectively .",
    "column ( 4 ) of tables 3 and 4 lists the srsic indices in the @xmath2 passband for galaxies at intermediate redshifts and the @xmath5 passband for galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "these passbands translate to approximately the rest - frame b band for all the galaxies .",
    "ideally galaxies which possess exponential profiles would have a srsic index of 1 whereas galaxies which possess a de vaucouleurs profile would have a srsic index of 4 .",
    "thus , from a naive inspection of the srsic indices of the galaxies at high redshifts , we would assume that only one ( i d 4 - 555.11 with @xmath37 = 1.467 ) has a steeper profile than an exponential .",
    "however , we have demonstrated in section 3.3 that when we classify morphologies based on the srsic indices , it is critical to take into account the role of the psf since in many cases , especially at high redshifts , the psf can smooth what was originally an @xmath13 profile to one with @xmath37 @xmath3 1 .",
    "the 5th column lists our profile classification for each galaxy ( after taking into account psf effects ) based on the galaxy models discussed in section 3.3 where `` dev '' represents a de vaucouleurs @xmath13 profile , `` exp '' represents an exponential profile , `` int '' represents an intermediate profile with 1 @xmath14 @xmath37 @xmath14 4 ( these galaxies most likely possess both a bulge and disk component ) , and `` o '' represents `` others '' for galaxies showing irregular structure which could not be fit with any profile .",
    "in our attempt to classify the morphologies of the galaxies , we do not automatically assume that objects which possesss exponential profiles are disks while objects which possess de vaucouleurs profiles are spheroids since this is not necessarily always the case because many dwarf spheroids have been shown to possess exponential profiles @xcite .",
    "we naively lump into one category ( `` o '' ) those galaxies which have irregular profiles and do not follow an exponential or @xmath13 law .",
    "@xcite explain that there are actually two types of `` irregular '' galaxies .",
    "one type is the traditional irregular which is the late - type system classified in the hubble scheme whereas the other type possesses an irregular profile as a result of galaxy - galaxy interactions and mergers .",
    "however , it is not within the scope of this paper to differentiate between the two types .",
    "thus , it is evident that our classification scheme represents an oversimplification designed to obtain a sense of the overall trends in the morphologies of the galaxies and should not be taken as a robust classification scheme on the individual level .",
    "figures @xmath50 show the surface brightness profiles and the fits to the profiles of all the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the williams et al .",
    "( 1996 ) identification numbers and srsic indices are included in the plots .",
    "figures 4 and 5 represent plots of the half - light radii versus the srsic indices ( @xmath51 ) of the model disks and spheroids after they had been convolved with the hdf psf in the @xmath2 ( with @xmath2 = 21 , 22 , 23 , and 24 ) and @xmath5 ( with @xmath5 = 23 and 24 ) passband respectively .",
    "again , for the high redshift sample , the results from the galaxy models are only reliable for @xmath5 @xmath14 24.5 since for fainter magnitudes , it is difficult to clearly distinguish the locus of srsic indices for the model spheroids from the locus of srsic indices for the model disks .",
    "the triangles represent the values for the model spheroids and the asterisks represent the values for the model disks .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines represent weighted least - squares fit to the model spheroids and model disks respectively , whereas the solid lines represent the 1@xmath52 error in the fits . for all @xmath2 magnitudes and for @xmath5",
    "@xmath14 24.5 , we have also plotted the values of the galaxies in our intermediate and high redshift sample ( represented by squares ) to attempt to classify their morphologies by observing where they fall on the diagram .",
    "we do not include in these plots those galaxies which could not be fit by the srsic law since their profiles were too irregular .",
    "these galaxies were , however , still included in our statistics and were labeled as `` o '' for `` others '' . at intermediate redshifts ,",
    "the morphologies are better constrained since the galaxies are brighter and the distinction between the model spheroids and disks is more apparent . as a further check on the accuracy of our classification system , we can utilize the images we have of the intermediate redshift galaxies since , for many , they are large enough and bright enough to classify their morphologies by eye .    with the @xmath51 plots , we have attempted to classify the morphologies of all the galaxies in the intermediate redshift bin and those with @xmath5 @xmath14 24.5 in the high redshift bin , although it should be kept in mind that the process is rather crude since it relies mainly on the galaxy models which should be regarded as highly speculative at small scale lengths and faint magnitudes .",
    "the galaxies whose srsic indices fall above the locus for the model spheroids were classified as posessing @xmath13 profiles since this would indicate that they possess profiles that are steeper than our models , whereas those whose srsic indices fall below the locus for the model disks are classified as possessing exponential profiles since this would indicate they possess profiles that are shallower than our models .",
    "for the galaxies which have srsic indices in between the locus of our model spheroids and disks , we placed an acceptance limit of 5@xmath52 . if the values of the srsic indices were less than 5@xmath52 away from the locus of spheroids , we classified them as possessing @xmath13 profiles , if they were less than 5@xmath52 from the locus of the disks , we classified them as possessing exponential profiles , and if they were more than 5@xmath52 away from either loci , we classified them as possessing intermediate profiles .",
    "there were a few galaxies which possessed srsic indices with less than 5@xmath52 deviations from both loci . in these cases , we classified them according to the magnitude of their deviation",
    ". if the deviation from the locus of model spheroids was less than it was from the locus of model disks , then we classified those galaxies as possessing @xmath13 profiles .",
    "if however , the converse was true , we classified those galaxies as possessing exponential profiles . but here is where we introduce some uncertainty in our classification scheme .",
    "since these galaxies have such small deviations from both loci , even though we associate these galaxies with a certain profile , it does not mean that it can not possess the other types of profiles .",
    "for example , i d 3 - 404 was classified as possessing an exponential profile since its srsic index was only 2.1@xmath52 away from the locus of the model disks , however , there is still a good chance that it could possess an @xmath13 profile since it was only 3.3@xmath52 away from the locus of model spheroids . or",
    "it could also possibly possess an intermediate profile .",
    "there are only two galaxies in the intermediate redshift sample ( ids 2 - 353 and 3 - 404 ) and one in the high redshift sample ( i d 2 - 321 ) which have less than 5@xmath52 deviations from both loci . if we include these uncertainties , it will at most increase the poissonian errors by 1 percent .",
    "thus , the profile classification is very robust , and the uncertainties in the classification system is dominated by the poissonian error .",
    "table 5 summarizes our best effort to classify the morphologies of the galaxies based on the combination of the results from the fits to the surface brightness profiles of the galaxies in the two redshift bins , the plots of the galaxy models , and visual inspection .",
    "quoted are the percentages found for each profile with their poissonian error . the number of galaxies possessing that profile is in parenthesis . in our intermediate redshift sample , out of 32 galaxies , we classified 28 @xmath11 9% as possessing @xmath13 profiles , 53 @xmath11 13% as possessing exponential profiles , 13 @xmath11 6% as intermediates , and 6 @xmath11 3% as `` others '' since they possessed irregular substructure .",
    "the galaxy that we did not include in the statistics is i d 3 - 610 in which both an @xmath13 and and exponential component could be resolved .",
    "the srsic index for the inner region of this galaxy is 2.32 while for the outer , disk part it is 0.826 .",
    "this is the only galaxy large enough in our sample to distinguish the two components . in our high redshift sample",
    "only 20 galaxies had @xmath5 @xmath53 .",
    "out of these galaxies , we classified 60 @xmath11 15% as possessing @xmath13 profiles , 20 @xmath11 10% as possessing exponential profiles , and 20 @xmath11 10% as `` others '' .",
    "in the high redshift bin there are no galaxies which we classified as intermediates .",
    "this does not mean that no intermediates exist at these redshifts , but rather that since the separation between the locus of model spheroids and model disks is very small , there is not a clearly defined region for the intermediate cases .",
    "we must stress that we are limited by small number statistics , especially at high redshifts since we are only able to classify the morphologies of 20 out of our original 50 galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , we can still comment on the general trends seen . from table 5",
    ", we see that , at higher look - back time , the fraction of the galaxies possessing @xmath13 profiles increased by 32 @xmath11 18% whereas the fraction of exponential - type profiles decreased by 33 @xmath11 16% .",
    "these differences are marginally significant since they represent @xmath21 2@xmath52 changes in both cases .",
    "our results differ from what has been previously published @xcite . by using a profile decomposition method on 522 galaxies down to @xmath54 @xmath3 26",
    ", @xcite found that the majority of hdf - n galaxies are disk dominated with only 8% having dominant bulge fractions .",
    "they interpreted their results as measuring a decrease in the number of bulge dominated galaxies as a function of look - back time .",
    "given the high degree of difficulty in the classification of the morphologies of these small faint galaxies , which are severely affected by the psf and the limitation of small number statistics , it is not surprising that at this point , we are not able to reach a general consensus . at high redshifts , we also see a statistically insignificant increase of 14 @xmath11 10% in the fraction of galaxies which we have classified as `` others '' .",
    "this is along the lines of what was observed in previous studies of galaxies in the hdf - n which have shown that by @xmath55 @xmath20 24 , there are few galaxies possessing traditional hubble sequence morphologies .",
    "instead they tend to be more `` peculiar '' in the sense that they may represent mergers in progress @xcite .",

    "they found that all but two ( one of them being galaxy 2 - 251 in our sample ) exhibited redder colors towards the centers . at @xmath15 , both an age and a metallicity gradient in the stellar populations",
    "can be responsible for producing the negative color gradients observed in the galaxies , i.e. the galaxy colors are redder in the center than in the outer parts because they either have older stellar populations or higher metallicities there .",
    "this age - metallicity degeneracy makes it difficult to determine the cause of the color gradient . in order to break the degeneracy , they generated two model gradients which reproduce the typical color gradients of elliptical galaxies at @xmath15 , one caused by a metallicity gradient of old stars , the other from an age gradient of stars with the same metallicity .",
    "they then evolved these models to the redshifts of their observed galaxy sample . by comparing the model gradients with the observed gradients",

    "we also have ( @xmath66 ) color profiles for the galaxies in our intermediate redshift sample which reveal the same trends in the color gradients ( figure 10 ) .",
    "we again observe that over half ( 5 out of 9 ) of the galaxies possessing @xmath13 profiles exhibit negative color gradients .",
    "thus , we may interpret the central reddening in the color profiles of the elliptical galaxies in our intermediate redshift sample in the hdf - n as being due primarily to a metallicity gradient ; the centers of the galaxies have higher metallicities than in the outer parts .",
    "we observe the same negative trend in the color gradients for the majority of the intermediate redshift galaxies ( 14 out of 23 ) which we classified as peculiars / irregulars or having exponential profiles . in the study of the near - ir and optical color profiles of 86 face - on disk dominated galaxies",
    ", @xcite concluded that their negative color gradients were best reproduced by models involving both stellar age and metallicity gradients .",
    "therefore , we interpret the gradients seen in the late - type galaxies as arising as a result of both age and metallicity effects ; the central parts of the galaxies in general have older stars and higher metallicity than the outer parts making them have redder colors towards the centers .",
    "whereas the trends seen in the color profiles of our intermediate redshift sample are well understood , we can not say the same for our high redshift sample . since this is the first study of its kind to be conducted on galaxies with z @xmath59 2.0 , there are no other high redshift observations of color profiles to compare our results with .",
    "thus , we must attempt to account for the positive gradients seen in our high redshift sample by understanding what is responsible for producing similar trends in the color profiles seen at intermediate and low redshifts .",
    "@xcite generated rest - frame @xmath68 color profiles for five compact narrow emission line galaxies ( cnelgs ) which are low mass ( @xmath69 @xmath70 ) starburst systems seen at @xmath71 and are similar to nearby hii galaxies .",
    "they noticed that although the gradients were not significant , there was a slight trend for the bluest color to occur in the central regions . on average , they found that the color inside the half - light radius is @xmath72 mag bluer than outside the half - light radius .",
    "@xcite futhermore describes the cnelgs as having either compact cores , fans and tails , or several small compact regions .",
    "these morphologies are along the lines of what we see in our high redshift sample .",
    "they also determined half - light radii to span from @xmath73 kpc ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) which match the range we see in our high redshift sample .",
    "given that the morphologies , half - light radii , and color profiles of the cnelgs are similar to what we observe in the high redshift sample , it is not unreasonable to believe that cnelgs could be the low redshift , lower - luminosity analogs of the higher redshift lyman break galaxies .",
    "we can then interpret the positive gradients seen in our high redshift sample as being caused by centrally concentrated starbursts .",
    "the high redshift galaxies have been shown to possess modest to high star formation rates ( @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath70/yr , @xmath78=0.5 ) @xcite which further enforces the idea that the positive gradients seen in our sample could be caused by centrally concentrated starbursts .",
    "starbursts can be triggered by several mechanisms including mergers and interactions @xcite , bar instabilities @xcite , and sne and stellar winds , e.g. @xcite .",
    "since the volume of the high redshift universe is smaller than it is now , mergers have been implied to be the cause of the enhanced star formation , however , this topic is still under debate . in section 7",
    ", we argue that the starbursts which may be responsible for causing the central blue colors of our high redshift sample are most likely ignited through mergers and interactions .      when we discuss the trends seen in the color profiles , we must take into account the uncertainities involved .",
    "these uncertainties include the determination of the sky background , the correlation of the pixels , and the role of dust . while statistical errors dominating the inner parts of the color profiles and psf effects contribute to the uncertainty in the least - squares fit , the systematic errors due to sky subtraction dominate in the outer parts of the profile . in order to assess how our color gradients are affected by sky subtraction , we chose 20 high redshift galaxies possessing positive color gradients and for each we obtained statistics on 11x11 pixel wide grids in six blank areas of the sky around the object in the @xmath2 and the @xmath28 passbands .",
    "we generated a histogram of the 726 total pixels in the six grids to determine the mean and the standard deviation of the mean ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "for each galaxy , we then determined both a lower and an upper limit of the sky values in @xmath2 and @xmath28 by subtracting 3@xmath52 from the means to obtain their lower limits ( i- , j- ) and adding 3@xmath52 to the means to obtain their upper limits ( i+,j+ ) .",
    "lastly , we generated their ( @xmath57 ) color profiles and obtained their color gradients for each of the five possible combinations of sky values subtracted off ( ( 1 ) mean in @xmath2 , mean in @xmath28 ( 2 ) i- , j- ( 3 ) i+,j+ ( 4 ) i-,j+ ( 5 ) i+ , j- ) . the mean in the color gradients for the five different cases respectively are 0.3722 , 0.425 , 0.321 , 0.249 , and 0.503 which represent a 3@xmath52 deviation of @xmath21 0.112 mag / dex making the typical uncertainty in the estimation of the sky background to be @xmath21 0.037 mag / dex .",
    "as we can see , the mean value of the color gradients remain positive and greater than 0.200 mag / dex in all cases .",
    "thus , we find that the typical gradients seen in the high redshift galaxies ( @xmath21 0.26 mag / dex ) are significant enough , that even with the uncertainties involved in the estimation of the sky background , our main conclusion that these galaxies have centrally concentrated star formation still holds .    another potential source of concern is the correlation of the pixels .",
    "since the images have been drizzled , convolved to recover approximately the same resolution as the @xmath5 image , and fitted with ellipses at 0.1 pixel increments , the errors that we obtain from the photometry will be correlated due to the oversampled pixels .",
    "thus , when we performed a weighted least - squares fit to the color profiles , the error bars used in the determination of the weights were correlated .",
    "consequently , the parameters that we obtain from the fit , i.e. the color gradient in this case , may be off from what would be measured if the errors had been independent . to understand how the correlated errors in our photometry affect the least - squares fitting to a straight line",
    ", we obtained rms images ( m. dickinson 2001 , private communication ) in the passbands of interest .",
    "these images quantify the uncertainty of the noise in the background ( sky + readout noise + dark current ) before any processes were performed to cause interpixel correlations .",
    "we re - analyzed ten random galaxies from the intermediate and high redshift sample using the rms images . with the same set of ellipses that we used in the surface photometry , we replaced the correlated errors with the `` true '' uncorrelated errors for each galaxy . in doing so",
    ", we have chosen to neglect the poisson noise from the galaxies themselves since they are so faint that it would be insignificant compared to the background noise . from this analysis",
    ", we find that even after taking into account interpixel correlations , the sign of the color gradients for the galaxies does not change .",
    "the high redshift galaxies still possess predominantly positive color gradients whereas the intermediate redshift galaxies possess predominantly negative color gradients .",
    "however , the rest - frame @xmath0 color profiles may be affected by the presence of dust . in theory",
    ", dust can cause the color profiles of galaxies to be redder towards the center if we assume that the dust would be more concentrated at the center and would produce more extinction there @xcite .",
    "@xcite conducted monte carlo simulations of light rays traveling through a dusty medium in order to understand to what extent dust can affect color gradients in late - type systems . they concluded that although a fraction of the color gradients could be attributed to dust , an additional explanation is needed to account for the total reddening in the system .",
    "@xcite produced color profiles extincted by dust for a set of model ellipticals from the u to the k passband and compared them with 52 early - type galaxies from the literature .",
    "they concluded that if dust is the primary cause of color gradients then the dust must be spatially extended ( @xmath79 @xmath80 ) implying high dust masses comparable to the dust masses inferred by the iras data .",
    "thus , the presence of dust may be partly responsible for producing the color gradients seen in our intermediate redshift sample for both early - type and late - type systems , however , given that the total mass of the dust and its spatial distribution are not well constrained , we can not say , for now , to what degree dust affects the color distribution in the galaxies . on the other hand , even though dust might play a role in our high redshift sample , there is no reason why its presence would cause the color profile to be bluer towards the center .",
    "as previously mentioned , dust would tend to cause extinction and , thus , reddening towards the center , not the outer parts of the galaxies .",
    "in fact , if dust is found to cause extinction in the centers of these galaxies , then the color gradients seen in our high redshift sample would be even greater .",
    "thus , although dust may play a role in generating the color gradients of our intermediate redshift sample , it can not explain the trends seen in our high redshift sample .",
    "anytime we compare observations of galaxies in two different redshift ranges , we must take into account the effect of observational selection . at high redshifts",
    ", we will be able to detect and study only those galaxies with the highest luminosities and surface brightnesses , thus , the trends that we see in the surface brightness and color profiles may potentially be affected by this bias .",
    "we have tried to minimize some selection effects by observing the galaxies at different redshifts in the same rest - frame wavelengths .",
    "this guarantees that at all redshifts , we will be probing the same population of stars .",
    "furthermore , at high redshifts we sample not only galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts , but also galaxies with photometric redshifts which are , in general , fainter than those galaxies that can be detected spectroscopically .",

    "is associated with early - type systems such as ellipticals and early - type spirals and high asymmetry is associated with merging systems , it seems from her plots that at z @xmath20 1.2 , there is a decrease in the early - type systems and an increase in merging systems .",
    "however , she shows in her work , that these trends can naturally be explained by selection effects . in her simulations",
    "she has shown that , by @xmath83 most of these galaxies with high concentration have faded so much that they `` disappear '' into the noise and can no longer be detected .    from wu s ( 1999 )",
    "discussion it is quite possible that the trends we see in the surface brightness profiles may be influenced by these selection effects . in our work with the surface brightness profiles , if we had not corrected for the psf effect , we would have seen the same decrease in early - type systems .",
    "if we just inspect the srsic indices of the galaxies and ignore the effect of psf smearing , we would naively classify 5 out of a total of 32 ( 16 @xmath11 7% ) of the galaxies in the intermediate sample and only 1 out of the 20 ( 5 @xmath11 5% ) galaxies with h @xmath14 24.5 in the high redshift sample as possessing an @xmath13 profile .",
    "thus , it would seem that the number of early - type systems had decreased with redshift .",
    "however , since we have corrected for the effect of the psf , we recover the number of galaxies with @xmath13 profiles ( i.e. 28 @xmath11 9% for the intermediate redshift sample and 60 @xmath11 15% in the high redshift sample ) . thus , by correcting for the psf , we take care of one selection effect . however at z @xmath20 2 , we are still sampling only the tip of the surface brightness function where asymmetries are more evident .",
    "consequently , it is not surprising that we would find a slightly higher fraction of `` irregular '' galaxies in the high redshift sample , 20 @xmath11 10% as opposed to 6 @xmath11 3% in the intermediate redshift sample .",

    "furthermore , depending on their merging histories , these lyman break progenitors can end up as a l @xmath20 l * galaxy with any morphological type .",
    "if they experienced major mergers at recent epochs they may evolve to become ellipticals and s0s .",
    "if they grew by the quiescent accretion of cooling gas , the gas might form a disk around a bulge that was created by an earlier merger event . and if they experienced minor mergers which are too weak to destroy the disk , they might accumulate more stars in the central bulge .",
    "they expect the lyman break galaxies to be rotating disks with typical half - light radii @xmath98 and predict that the stars of the progenitors will congregate primarily in the central regions .",
    "bcfl additionally conclude that the star formation of galaxies at all redshifts occurs quiescently with sfrs that never obtain a value higher than a few solar masses per year .",

    "thus , they advocate that star formation occurred at a higher rate in the high redshift universe and that mergers were responsible for increasing the star formation rate by triggering gas inflow to the central regions .",
    "the positive color gradients we see at high redshifts would then be associated with nuclear starbursts induced by mergers and/or interactions , which could also cause star formation to `` migrate '' over time from the central regions to the spiral arms where we see most of the star formation today .",

    "then some galaxies may undergo mergers , which funnel gas to the central regions causing a burst of star formation .",
    "after awhile , the gas will be depleted and dispersed such that during the late stages of merger , the central light profiles will evolve to follow the @xmath13 law @xcite . during the late stages of the merger , the presence of a central bulge might suppress the inflow of gas and consequently reduce the star formation efficiency @xcite .",
    "then if the galaxy experiences further interactions with another galaxy , material can rain in on the outer parts causing the gas to collapse to form stars around the spheroid",
    ". therefore , if the hierarchical structure formation scenario represents an accurate prediction of structure formation , then at redshifts between 2.0 @xmath14 z @xmath14 3.5 , we may be witnessing the epoch at which galaxies are experiencing mergers and their star formation is enhanced and centrally concentrated .",
    "from our surface brightness and color analysis of galaxies at a range of redshifts probed at the same rest - frame wavelengths in the hubble deep field - north , we conclude :    1 ) .",
    "the color profiles of galaxies reveal that at earlier epochs , there are fewer galaxies with old red stellar populations in their centers and most galaxies have centrally concentrated star formation . as in local samples of galaxies , our intermediate redshift galaxies ( 0.5 @xmath14 z @xmath14 1.2 ) have redder central regions due to a combination of age , metallicity and dust gradients . since age gradients are the only viable explanation for the central blueing of our high redshift sample , we conclude that the majority of high redshift galaxies contain centrally concentrated starbursts .    2 ) .",
    "from the galaxy models , we have demonstrated the importance of taking into account the psf effects before attempting to classify morphologies . after correcting for the psf effects in the surface brightness profiles ,",
    "we find that the population of galaxies possessing @xmath13 profiles have slightly increased with look - back time while those with exponential profiles have slightly decreased .",
    "our results also suggest a statistically insignificant increase in the fraction of galaxies with peculiar / irregular structure at higher redshifts .",
    "the results should be viewed with a note of caution , however , due to the small sample size and large uncertainties in the galaxy models especially at small scale lengths and faint magnitudes .",
    "if , as predicted by hierarchical galaxy formation models , mergers and interactions played an important role in the lifetime of these galaxies , such processes would be responsible for the positive color gradients indicative of centrally concentrated star formation seen in the high redshift galaxies .",
    "spf show that their `` collisional starburst '' model , in which bursts are triggered by mergers , best reproduces the observed properties of lyman break galaxies and of the universe in general .",
    "such centrally condensed nuclear star bursts are consistent with our observed trends in the color gradients . a good way to test whether the `` collisional starburst '' model holds is by applying the color - asymmetry diagram developed by @xcite to distinguish between starbursts driven by mergers and interactions from starbursts which were ignited by some other method .",
    "since the hubble deep field represents only a small volume of space , we must be cautious in generalizing our results to the universe as a whole .",
    "we need to obtain more observations of high redshift galaxies to measure critical quantities such as their virial masses and estimation of dust content .",
    "we also need to better understand how and to what degree observational selection comes into play when we compare galaxies at different redshifts .",
    "given that we are now detecting fainter galaxies at higher redshifts and that instruments with multi - object spectroscopic capabilities in the near - ir and 8-m class telescopes are now readily available , much information will undoubtedly be unraveled in the near future concerning the nature of lbgs which will allow us to formulate a more robust theory on the formation and evolution of galaxies .",

    "<S> we fit elliptical isophotes to the hubble deep field - north wfpc-2 and nicmos data to study the rest - frame @xmath0 color profiles and rest - frame b surface brightness profiles of 33 intermediate redshift galaxies ( @xmath1 ) with @xmath2 @xmath3 25 and 50 high redshift galaxies ( @xmath4 ) with @xmath5 @xmath3 27 . from the weighted least - squares fit to the color profiles we find that , at intermediate redshifts , the galaxies possess negative color gradients ( @xmath6 @xmath7/@xmath8log(r ) @xmath9= @xmath10 @xmath11 0.007 mag dex@xmath12 ) indicating a reddening towards the center of the profile similar to local samples whereas , at high redshifts , the galaxies possess positive color gradients ( @xmath6 @xmath7/@xmath8log(r ) @xmath9= 0.272 @xmath11 0.007 mag dex@xmath12 ) indicating that star formation is more centrally concentrated . </S>",
    "<S> although the presence of dust can cause some reddening to occur towards the centers of the profiles seen at intermediate redshifts , it can not explain the strong central blueing of light seen at high redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we are witnessing a population of galaxies with strong positive color gradients at high redshifts which do not seem to exist in large numbers at lower redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that star formation is more centrally concentrated in the distant galaxy sample which differs from the prevalent mode of extended disk star formation that we observe in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we find that it is critical to correct for psf effects when evaluating the surface brightness profiles since at small scale lengths and faint magnitudes , an @xmath13 profile can be smoothed out substantially to become consistent with an exponential profile . after correcting for psf effects , we find that at higher look - back time , the fraction of galaxies possessing exponential profiles have slightly decreased while the fraction of galaxies possessing @xmath13 profiles have slightly increased . </S>",
    "<S> our results also suggest a statistically insignificant increase in the fraction of peculiar / irregular type galaxies . </S>",
