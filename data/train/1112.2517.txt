    "transient liquid jets produced by flow focusing have been studied from various perspectives due to fundamental interest and their widespread occurence ( see e.g. the review article by @xcite ) .",
    "common instances include bubbles bursting at a liquid surface @xcite , high amplitude faraday waves @xcite , jets generated by the impulsive acceleration of a liquid surface @xcite , shaped charges , and others .",
    "+ in all these cases , the jet is produced when a liquid surface concave towards the gas is impulsively accelerated .",
    "the resulting ",
    "kinematic focusing \" of the liquid , which converges towards the center of the curvature , is responsible for the peculiarly high - speed jets generated in this way .",
    "+ in shaped charges this convergence is caused by a detonation wave investing the free surface .",
    "the early history of these devices and the principle on which they operate is described by @xcite , followed by many works , e.g. , @xcite in more recent years .",
    "the focusing , however , can also be caused by geometrical effects simply due to the concave shape of the interface without reliance on liquid compressibility ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ in this study we describe yet another way for the generation of such a jet .",
    "we use a microtube in which the impulsive acceleration of the interface is due to the abrupt vaporization of a small mass of liquid caused by the absorption of a laser pulse .",
    "+ bubble generation by the absorption of a focused laser pulse in the bulk of a liquid volume has been an established experimental technique for a long time ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the same technique has been used to generate bubbles in the proximity of the free surface of a liquid  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "strong jets are often observed .",
    "for example , @xcite , who focused a laser pulse into a drop resting on a glass surface , report jet maximum velocities of 250 m / s produced by small bubbles near the free surface , but without the ability to control the number , size and location of these bubbles .",
    "+ in the present work we also use a laser pulse to create a bubble near a free surface , but the geometry of the system and condition of the experiment are quite different from those of earlier workers .",
    "furthermore , the microjet that we describe has extraordinary characteristics : it is created under controlled condition with good reproducibility ; its maximum velocity reaches 850 m / s , namely a mach number in air approaching 3 ; its diameter is typically one order of magnitude smaller than the diameter of the capillary tube ; its generation requires moderate laser energies of the order of 10 @xmath0j , comparable to the typical energy of a laser pointer .",
    "+ a potential particularly attractive application of the present supersonic microjets is for _ needle - free drug injection _ @xcite . for this application , in which a liquid solution containing a drug is forced to penetrate human or animal tissue through the skin , ultra - high velocities ( greater than 200 m / s ) , fine scales ( down to 30 @xmath0 m ) , and good",
    "reproducibility and controllability are essential .",
    "+ the development of needle - free drug injection systems is of paramount importance in the global fight against the spread of disease as these systems help preventing contamination by needles .",
    "several methods of microjet generation suitable for this application have been proposed ( @xcite ) , but they all have several shortcomings : the production of each jet requires a siginificant amount of energy , the resulting shape of the ejected liquid mass tends to be diffuse rather than focused , the small size - nozzles are easily clogged and others . + the microjets produced by the method described in this study are free from these problems . in particular , they are faster and highly focused .",
    "furthurmore , the avoidance of very thin nozzles makes the systems less susceptible to clogging , thus improving the reliability and controllability .",

    "the bubble growth is larger in the second case and the motion of the liquid column in the tube is more evident .",

    "we have always found that , unless the bubble is generated less than one diameter away from the free surface ( @xmath17 ) , the asymmetry of its growth does not affect the axial symmetry of the jet . this observation supports the hypothesis that the cause of the thin jet is the sudden onset of a high pressure rather than the bubble expansion _ per se_. + figure",

    "is due to surface tension as suggested by the fact that the deceleration is suppressed at higher velocities , i.e. , higher weber numbers .",
    "as the jet becomes thinner , the rate of new surface generation decreases , surface tension becomes less important , and the jet tip velocity reaches an asymptotic value @xmath19 ; shortly thereafter a drop starts to form at the tip ( iv ) and it eventually detaches . + it is worth mentioning that a very small fraction of the liquid receiving the initial impulse and focusing into the jet is in contact with the wall , and therefore its motion is not significantly affected by contact line phenomena . in any event",

    "+ the jet velocity exhibits an inverse proportionality to the tube diameter and to the distance of the laser focus from the free surface , while it is proportional to the absorbed energy above a threshold value .",
    "the velocity is very strongly dependent on the curvature of the free surface , which is a function of the tube - liquid initial contact angle .",
    "it is also critically dependent on the amount of liquid vaporized and on its distance from the free surface , both of which can be varied by varying the position of the laser focus .",
    "in particular , it has been found that the offset of the laser focus with respect to the tube axis has a strong and very non - trivial effect . to elucidate the origin of this result",
    "we have used a geomterical - optics construction coupled with the beer - lambert law to determine approximately the size of the region where vaporization occurs and the absorbed energy . while still preliminary , the results of this analysis are in general agreement with the data .",
    "further theoretical and numerical investigations of the jetting phenomenon will be addressed in  @xcite .",
    "+ a priori results of the paper can be interpreted according to two different scenarios , one in which the shock wave generated by the nearly instantaneous vaporization plays a dominant role , and one in which the phenomenon is essentially incompressible .",
    "the estimate of the overpressure provided for the relatively low - velocity case in ",
    "[ subsection : energy ] suggests that , according to the incompressible model , a much higher pressure is necessary to account for the observations as compared to the shock wave model . for higher velocity cases ,",
    "the incompressible overpressure becomes even much larger than the critical pressure of water @xcite .",
    "these considerations lend support to the shock wave interpretation of the results presented in this paper . + the insights gained through this research and the ability to generate focused , controllable , and high velocity microjets open new doors for the realization , among others , of reliable needle - free drug delivery systems . +",

    "a geometrical optics approximation was developed to analyze energy absorption of the laser beam energy absorption by the liquid .",
    "the three main components of this calculation are : ( 1 ) splitting up the gaussian laser beam into many different rays each one with a representative energy ; ( 2 ) following the path of each ray through the capillary , including ( full or partial ) wall - reflections ; ( 3 ) using the beer - lambert law to model the local energy absorbed by the liquid .",
    "this law describes the local irradiance @xmath74 , and is given by @xmath75 , with @xmath76 the beam irradiance at the cylinder outer surface of the tube , @xmath77 the absorption coefficient , @xmath78 the arc length along the partial of the ray propagating in the liquid .",
    "the absorption coefficient was measured as @xmath79 ; the local energy loss of a ray equals @xmath80 .",
    "+ the liquid volumes are discretized into cells constituting a grid around the central loss area .",
    "the local energy lost by each ray in each cell was calculated from the beer - lambert law and add to the liquid in the cell .",
    "subsequently , for each cell , the total energy absorbed over the duration of the light pulse was compared with an estimate of the energy necessary for evaporation at room conditions , namely @xmath81 , with @xmath23 the liquid density , @xmath82 k the difference between the initial liquid temperature and the boiling temperature , @xmath83 j/(kgk ) the heat capacity at constant pressure , @xmath84 mj / kg the vaporization enthalpy , and @xmath85 the cell volume . if the energy absorbed by a cell exceeded @xmath86 , the cell volume was assumed to be vaporized instantaneously .",
    "summation of the vaporized - cell volumes then provided a measure for the initial bubble volume and position .",
