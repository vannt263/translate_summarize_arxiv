    "for the study of the structure of light unstable nuclei which are and have been extensively studied experimentally by the use of radioactive beams [ 1 - 3 ] , various theories [ 4 - 20 ] have been used [ 21,22 ] . among those theories , the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) approach",
    "has already proved to be useful and successful .",
    "one of the large merits of the amd approach is that it does not rely on any model assumptions such as axial symmetry of the deformation , existence of the clustering and so on .    until now",
    "this amd approach has not explicitly utilized the concept of the single particle motion in the mean field .",
    "the experimental data , however , show that very often we can get better understanding of the structure of unstable nuclei in terms of the single particle motion in the mean field . in order to see this point in more detail ,",
    "we here discuss briefly some features of be isotopes as an example . in",
    "be isotopes there is the famous problem that the ground state @xmath3be has an anomalous parity . according to the usual shell model , its spin - parity should be @xmath4 .",
    "but in experiments it is @xmath5 .",
    "an answer to this problem is that due to the deformation the @xmath6=@xmath5 level in sd shell comes down below the upper @xmath6=@xmath4 and the last neutron occupies the lowered @xmath6=@xmath5 .",
    "@xmath3be is also famous as a halo nucleus .",
    "since the lowered orbit contains s - orbit component , we can understand that the halo property is due to the long tail of the s - orbit .",
    "for the convenience of later discussion we call this lowered @xmath6=@xmath5 level  halo level  .",
    "= 0.6    in order to discuss other be isotopes than @xmath3be , we use the single particle diagram by the two - center shell model[18 - 20 ] , which is shown in fig.1 . according to the amd calculation for",
    "be isotopes , we can support the idea that be isotopes have the core part with an approximate dumbbell structure of two @xmath7 clusters , which is the reason why we use the two - center shell model .",
    "@xmath8be is known to have three rotational bands which have the band head states with j@xmath9=@xmath10 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we can explain these three bands in the two - center shell model as follows .",
    "we put the four neutrons in order from the lowest level at about z@xmath11=2.5 fm in this model , and when the last neutron is put in the levels of @xmath6=@xmath10(@xmath7 level ) , @xmath4(@xmath12 level ) and @xmath5(@xmath13 level ) , j@xmath9 becomes @xmath10 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "here , z@xmath11 is the eccentricity parameter , namely the distance between two centers in fig.1 .",
    "@xmath1be is known to have two rotational bands which have the band head states with j@xmath9=0@xmath0 and 1@xmath2 . in the same way as above ,",
    "the four neutrons are put in order from the lowest level at about z@xmath11=3 fm and when the configurations of the last two neutrons are @xmath14 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath14 ^ 1   [ \\omega^\\pi=\\frac{1}{2}^+]^1 $ ] , j@xmath9 becomes 0@xmath0 and 1@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "here we note that the @xmath6= @xmath5 level is the halo level which appeared in @xmath3be .",
    "these arguments show that by using the single particle orbits and by constructing the excited state by particle - hole excitation we can study the structure of be isotopes systematically .",
    "therefore we recognize the importance of the single particle motion in the mean field .    in this paper",
    "we propose the  amd + hartree - fock  method ( amd+hf ) which introduces the concept of the single particle orbits into the usual amd .",
    "we extract the component of the mean field from the amd wave function .",
    "once we get the single particle wave functions in the mean field , we can study the structure of the excited states by constructing various particle - hole configurations .",
    "when we need elaborate description of the single particle motion like in the case of neutron halo phenomena , we need to improve the amd single particle wave function in such a way that we adopt the superposition of several gaussians instead of the single gaussian wave packet in the usual amd .",
    "this paper is composed of six sections . in the second section",
    "we explain the formalism of amd+hf method . in the third section",
    "we show the single particle levels of the ground states of be isotopes which are calculated with amd+hf . in the forth section",
    "we show the single particle levels obtained with amd+hf as a function of the deformation parameter .",
    "in the fifth section , based on the motivation of the amd+hf , which means active use of the single particle levels , we construct the first plus - parity excited state of @xmath1be by putting two neutrons into the halo level and study it . and the last section is for the discussion and the summary .",
    "in this paper , we used the hamiltonian and wave function as described below .",
    "the hamiltonian has the form : @xmath15 here @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 stand for the kinetic energy , the central force , the ls force and the center - of - mass kinetic energy , respectively .",
    "we neglected the coulomb force .",
    "we used the volkov no.1 force as the central force and the g3rs force for the ls force .",
    "these forces have the following forms , @xmath20 , \\\\ \\hat{v}_{ls } & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i , j } v_{ls}[e^{-({\\hat{\\bf r}}_{ij}/r_{lsr})^2}-e^{-({\\hat{\\bf r}}_{ij}/r_{lsa})^2}]p(^3o)\\hat{\\bf l}_{ij}(\\hat{\\bf s}_i+\\hat{\\bf s}_j ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where m=0.56 , w=1@xmath21 m , b = h=0 , v@xmath22=144.86 mev , v@xmath23=@xmath2183.34 mev , r@xmath22=0.82 fm , r@xmath23=1.6 fm , v@xmath24=900 mev , r@xmath25=0.20 fm , r@xmath26=0.36 fm .",
    "p(@xmath27o ) is the projection operator onto the triplet odd state .",
    "as mentioned above , the wave function is parameterized by @xmath33 .",
    "these parameters are determined by solving the following cooling equation , @xmath34 here @xmath35 means @xmath33 , @xmath36 is an arbitrary real number and @xmath37 is a negative arbitrary number .",
    "we can easily prove that the energy of the total system decreases with time , @xmath38    we often need to obtain the minimum - energy state under some condition .",
    "for example , the condition is that the center - of - mass is fixed to the coordinate origin , or that the deformation parameter is fixed to some value , etc . in such case",
    ", the condition is combined to the cooling equation by the analogy of the lagrange - multiplier method . when the condition is represented as @xmath39(x@xmath40,x@xmath41)=0 ,",
    "the previous cooling equation is changed as below : @xmath42 \\hspace{0.5 cm } { \\rm and }   \\hspace{0.3 cm } c.c . , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is a lagrange - multiplier function , which is determined by @xmath44 : @xmath45 \\\\    & = & \\sum_i[\\frac{\\partial{\\cal w}}{\\partial x_\\imath } \\ { ( \\lambda+i\\mu)\\frac { 1}{i \\hbar } ( \\frac{\\partial { \\cal h } } { \\partial x_\\imath^*}+\\eta\\frac{\\partial { \\cal w}}{\\partial x_\\imath^*})\\ } \\\\    &   & \\mbox{}+ \\frac{\\partial{\\cal w}}{\\partial x_\\imath^*}\\{(\\lambda - i\\mu ) \\frac { -1}{i \\hbar } ( \\frac{\\partial { \\cal h } } { \\partial x_\\imath}+\\eta\\frac{\\partial { \\cal w } } { \\partial x_\\imath})\\ } ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this equation we get @xmath46 , \\\\",

    "but we can use it also in the case where several conditions exist .",
    "when several conditions are represented as @xmath47 these conditions can be represented by a single equation , @xmath48 here @xmath49 are positive coefficients which adjust the difference of scale between @xmath50 . by this way , we can always use eq.(1 ) without introducing several lagrange - multipliers .",
    "the deformation parameter ( @xmath12,@xmath13 ) can be obtained from the following relations , @xmath51^\\frac{1}{6 } } & = & \\exp[\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{4 \\pi } } \\beta \\cos(\\gamma + \\frac{2 \\pi}{3 } ) ]   , \\\\",

    ". we can easily confirm that this definition of deformation parameter is the same as that of bohr model to the first order . here",
    "expectation value of every operator is calculated with the intrinsic wave function before parity projection .",
    "in addition @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 is redefined so that @xmath56 .",
    "we must note the fact that in this definition z axis is not always the axial symmetric axis of the system . in the case of prolate deformation , z axis determined by this definition is certainly the axial symmetric axis , while in the case of oblate deformation it is not the axial symmetric axis .",
    "when we execute the cooling calculation with deformation constraint , it consumes time that in every step of the cooling we calculate the inertial axes to determine the deformation parameters . therefore we use rotational invariant scalar quantities for calculating the deformation parameters so as to avoid the time - consuming procedure .",
    "we define the tensor quantity _ q _ in any coordinate system as below : @xmath57 where i , j are x , y , z. then calculating the trace of the tensors _ q _ and _ qq _ , we get the rotational invariant quantities tr_q _ and tr_qq_. since calculating these quantities in the space - fixed frame is identical to that in body - fixed frame , we obtain the following relations : @xmath58^\\frac{1}{3 } \\sum_i a_i^2 \\\\   & =   & [ < x^2><y^2><z^2>]^\\frac{1}{3 } \\cdot ( 3+\\frac{15}{4 \\pi } \\beta^2 + \\cdots ) , \\\\ trqq_{space - fixed } & = & trqq_{body - fixed } \\\\   & = & \\sum_i < r^2_i>^2_{body - fixed } = [ < x^2><y^2><z^2>]^\\frac{2}{3 } \\sum_i a_i^4 \\\\   & =   & [ < x^2><y^2><z^2>]^\\frac{2}{3 } \\cdot ( 3+\\frac{15}{\\pi }",
    "\\beta^2 + \\cdots ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using these quantities , we define _ d _ as below : @xmath59 then we can calculate the deformation parameter @xmath12 as @xmath60 thus we can obtain @xmath12 without using the inertial axes .",
    "this approximation is enough correct to the second order of @xmath12 , which in ordinary case is less than unity .",
    "when we impose the constraint that @xmath12 is fixed to some @xmath61 , we use _ d _ and _ d_@xmath11 corresponding to @xmath12 and @xmath61 in the cooling calculation .",
    "the constraint condition function @xmath62 is given as @xmath63        as mentioned in the introduction , we need to calculate the single particle orbits .",
    "we calculate them by the method shown below .",
    "this method extracts the single particle orbits from amd wave function by mimicking the hartree - fock theory .    in the hartree - fock method ,",
    "the matrix elements h@xmath64 of the single particle hamiltonian in orthonormal base @xmath65 are given as @xmath66 by diagonalizing this h@xmath64 , we obtain the set of the single particle wave functions and the single particle energies .",
    "now we construct hartree - fock - like single particle orbits and levels from total wave function of amd .",
    "the single particle wave functions @xmath67 of amd are not orthonormal .",
    "so first we construct the orthonormal base by making linear - combination of @xmath67 .",
    "we calculate the set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the overlap matrix _ b _ , @xmath68 eigenvectors @xmath69 are normalized .",
    "we define new base @xmath70 as follows : @xmath71 we construct the matrix @xmath72 corresponding to the single particle hamiltonian of hartree - fock as follows : @xmath73 diagonalizing this matrix @xmath74 , we calculate the eigenvalues @xmath75 , and eigenvectors @xmath76 , @xmath77 the eigenvectors @xmath76 are normalized . the single particle wave function @xmath78 belonging to the single particle energy @xmath79 is given as @xmath80 \\\\      & = & \\sum_i [ \\sum_\\alpha g_\\alpha^p            \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu^\\alpha } } c^\\alpha_i ] |\\varphi_i > .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we call such single particle orbits @xmath81 and energies @xmath75 amd - hf orbits and energies , respectively since they are extracted from amd wave function .    here",
    "we should note that these orbits and energies of amd - hf are not totally equivalent to those of hartree - fock .",
    "the reason is as below . in amd+hf ,",
    "the hartree - fock equation is solved only within the functional space of single particle wave functions which is spanned by @xmath67 .",
    "thus in amd+hf the hartree - fock self - consistency is satisfied only within this restricted functional space .",
    "we can regard the amd+hf method as being a kind of restricted hartree - fock method .",
    "however this restriction has a large merit because the functional space spanned by the single particle wave functions @xmath67 is obtained by the energy variation including parity projection .      we need to identify the amd - hf orbits @xmath78 defined in the previous section .",
    "as almost nuclei seem to have axially symmetric deformation approximately , we expect that z component of the total angular momentum , @xmath82 , is approximately a good - quantum number , but that the magnitude of it , @xmath83 , is not .",
    "in addition , when the states that have the same absolute value of @xmath84 are degenerate , the expectation value of @xmath82 does nt give us useful information .",
    "therefore we use the square of @xmath82 , @xmath85 , so as to avoid this difficulty .",
    "for example , let us consider the state @xmath78 which includes @xmath86 and @xmath87 as below : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    the expectation value of @xmath82 is @xmath89 on the other hand , the expectation value of @xmath85 is @xmath90 from which we can identify _ m _ certainly .",
    "by the way , this identification is done on the body - fixed frame as noticed in the section about calculating the deformation . here",
    "we calculate the inertial axes explicitly by diagonalizing the tensor @xmath91 , which was introduced in section ii.a.3 .",
    "we choose the z - axis of the body - fixed frame to the direction of the @xmath92 s eigenvector which has the largest eigenvalue . here",
    "@xmath92 represents _ q _ calculated in the space - fixed frame .",
    "using the eigenvector @xmath93 , we can relate @xmath94 and @xmath95 as follows : @xmath96 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the total angular momentum operator in space - fixed frame and that in the body - fixed frame , respectively .",
    "thus the square @xmath84 in the body - fixed frame is represented using the quantities in the space - fixed frame as below : @xmath97 in addition , we use also the square of the orbital angular momentum @xmath98 , which is not a good - quantum number .",
    "this enables us to relate the obtained levels to the levels which would be obtained if the shape were spherical .",
    "in this section we show the results about amd - hf orbits of the ground states that are obtained by amd . here",
    "amd single particle wave functions are composed of the single gaussians .    in table",
    "i , the amd - hf levels are given .",
    "@xmath99 and @xmath100 indicate the expectation values of the operators @xmath85 and @xmath98 respectively , which are obtained by the method mentioned in section ii.b.2 . @xmath12 and b.e .",
    "are the deformation parameter and the binding energy respectively .",
    "we explain the results , about @xmath8be , @xmath1be and @xmath3be , that look interesting .",
    "then we compare these with the simple model  two - center shell model  to help our understanding .",
    "* a.@xmath8be *    in the minus - parity amd state of @xmath8be , @xmath99 of the highest level of neutron is 1.260 , which is not equal to any of 0.25(=@xmath101 ) , 2.25(=@xmath102 ) , etc .",
    "this means the deformation is not axial symmetric . but",
    "@xmath100=2.995 implies that this level contains rather large amount of the 0p@xmath103 component .    in the plus - parity state ,",
    "the last neutron is in the level of @xmath104 .",
    "in addition @xmath100 of this level is 4.884 .",
    "as this value is rather large , we can suppose that this level consists largely of d - orbit .",
    "in the two center shell model given in fig.1 , the plus - parity level named @xmath13 level in fig.1 comes down in energy when the distance between two alpha clusters is large .",
    "this is consistent with our result because the deformation parameter @xmath12 obtained in amd for the plus - parity state is 0.801 , which is very large .",

    "this level is a state with large parity - mixing .",
    "* c.@xmath3be *    in the calculated plus - parity state of @xmath3be , the last neutron occupies what we call  halo level  .",
    "@xmath99=0.25 means @xmath120=@xmath121 and @xmath100=4.463 of this level means that this level contains a large component of 0d@xmath110 .",
    "we think that this result is similar to that of the two - center shell model with medium distance between two @xmath7 particles .",
    "the obtained value of the deformation parameter @xmath12=0.504 , which is medium , is consistent with the medium distance in the two - center shell model .",
    "however in the calculated minus - parity state of @xmath3be , we do nt find so good similarity between amd+hf and the two - center shell model .",
    "as @xmath12=0.271 is rather small , we try to compare the obtained result to that of the two - center shell model with small inter-@xmath7 distance . in that case",
    ", the last neutron should be put into the level named the @xmath12 level in fig.1 which has @xmath120=@xmath121 and comes from 0p@xmath122 in spherical case .",
    "but according to amd+hf calculation , @xmath99 of the last neutron level is 1.314 , which means that @xmath120 is not @xmath121 .    by the way",
    ", there is the famous problem in @xmath3be , which is that the parity of the ground state is not minus but plus . in this calculation , we have not succeeded to reproduce this anomalous parity just like the previous amd calculation of ref .. we think that this failure comes from the insufficient description of the single particle orbits in the present calculation where we have assigned only one gaussian for one nucleon .",
    "in this section , we show the amd - hf orbits at various @xmath12 , which look like nilsson diagram .",
    "the levels at each @xmath12 are calculated by the method as mentioned in the section ii.a.2 . as in the previous section ,",
    "we show only the results about @xmath8be(@xmath21 ) , @xmath1be(@xmath21 ) and @xmath3be(@xmath21 ) , which look interesting .",
    "we show the diagram of the neutron s amd - hf levels of @xmath8be(@xmath21 ) , @xmath1be(@xmath21 ) and @xmath3be(@xmath21 ) in fig.2(a ) , fig.3(a ) and fig.4(a ) , respectively .",
    "as the behavior of the highest level in each diagram looks especially interesting , we show the variation of @xmath100 , @xmath99 and the percentage of the plus - parity component of the highest level in fig.2(b ) , fig.3(b ) and fig.4(b ) .",
    "in addition as the second and the third levels in @xmath3be(@xmath21 ) look interesting too , we show the same quantities about these levels in fig.4(c ) and fig.4(d ) .",
    "notice that the scale on the right hand side is used for the percentage of the plus - parity component .",
    "* a.@xmath8be(@xmath21 ) *    = 0.6    in fig.2(a ) we can see the inversion or the crossing of the single particle levels like that appearing in the two - center shell model .",
    "when we trace the behavior of the last neutron s level , in fig.2(b ) we see that up to @xmath12=0.67 the last level seems to be @xmath123 coming from 0p@xmath107 in spherical case . but beyond @xmath12=0.67 , its behavior changes apparently .",
    "suddenly @xmath100 becomes rather large , @xmath99 becomes about 0.25 and the percentage of the plus - parity component becomes about 100% .",
    "therefore we can recognize it as the lowered halo level that is @xmath124 coming from 0d@xmath110 .",
    "we notice that the behaviors of the other levels than the highest level are also changed beyond @xmath12=0.67 in fig.2(a ) , but that @xmath100,@xmath99 and the percentage of the plus - parity component are not changed .",
    "as the parity of the last neutron is almost plus beyond @xmath12=0.67 , the total intrinsic wave function is an almost plus - parity state .",
    "therefore the projection to the minus - parity state is made by picking up the very small component of minus parity .    *",
    "b.@xmath1be(@xmath21 ) *    in fig.3(a ) , we can see that the last neutron s level keeps to be parity - mixed even if @xmath12 is changed .",
    "when we look at the behavior of the quantum numbers @xmath120 and _ l _ in fig.3(b ) , we find that as @xmath12 becomes larger @xmath125 approaches to @xmath121 and _ l _ increases too .",
    "this result seems to indicate that this level has two components , one being @xmath124 coming from 0d@xmath110 and the other being @xmath123 coming from 0p@xmath107 , and that as @xmath12 becomes larger the component of @xmath124 increases .",
    "in addition , according to the parity - mixing ratio , this insight seems to be correct , since as @xmath12 becomes larger the ratio of plus - parity component increases .",
    "= 0.6    * c.@xmath3be(@xmath21 ) *    we can see the tendency that the halo level , which is @xmath124 coming from 0d@xmath110 , is lowered at large @xmath12 . especially at @xmath12=0.7 @xmath126 0.8",
    "the tendency is prominent . in that region",
    ", we can see @xmath127 , @xmath128 and the parity is 100% minus for the highest level in fig.4(b ) . and in fig.4(c ) and 4(d )",
    ", @xmath100 is rather large , @xmath129 and the parity is about 90% plus for the second and third levels .",
    "therefore we can identify in this region the highest level as @xmath123 coming from 0p@xmath107 and the second and third levels as @xmath124 coming from 0d@xmath110 which is the lowered halo level .",
    "note that these two halo levels are not degenerate in this odd - neutron - number nucleus @xmath3be .",
    "but beyond @xmath12=0.8 the properties of the amd - hf levels change again . especially in fig.4(b ) ( the last neutron ) , the plus - parity component increases and @xmath100 becomes very large .",
    "we can explain this phenomenon with the two - center shell model as follows .",
    "the large deformation parameter @xmath12 corresponds to the large inter-@xmath7 distance in the two - center shell model .",
    "as shown in fig.1 , in such case the @xmath7 level and @xmath13 level approach very closely and are degenerate . in our calculation",
    "the same phenomenon as the two - center shell model seems to happen and then the component of the halo orbit mixes into the highest level .",
    "the original amd does not have the concept of the single particle orbit in the mean field .",
    "however we have confirmed in sections iii and iv that amd contains in it the mean field ( and its single particle orbits ) . in sections",
    "iii and iv , we used the single particle orbits only for  analyzing the amd wave function  . in this section ,",
    "we truly  use  the single particle orbits by performing  particle - hole excitation  for the ground state .",
    "our idea is that if the amd - hf orbits are really meaningful , the description of excited states by the particle - hole excitation should be meaningful .",
    "here we apply such p - h excitation for constructing the first excited @xmath130 state of @xmath1be at 6.179 mev which is just above the lowest 1@xmath2 state at 5.960 mev .",
    "one of possible configurations for this 0@xmath0 is that two neutrons occupy the halo orbit , which is @xmath120=@xmath121 level coming from 0d@xmath110 in the two - center shell model .",
    "so we want to confirm that the second @xmath130 constructed by such p - h excitation appears in the vicinity of the lowest 1@xmath2 as shown by the experiment .",
    "according to the two - center shell model , the lowest minus - parity state , which has the total angular momentum 1 , seems to have the configuration that each of the levels , @xmath6=@xmath10 from 0p@xmath107(@xmath7 level ) and @xmath6=@xmath5 from 0d@xmath110(@xmath13 level ) which is  halo level  , is occupied by one neutron .",
    "therefore by raising up the neutron occupying @xmath6=@xmath10 to @xmath6=@xmath5 , the configuration becomes @xmath131 ^ 2 $ ] which gives us the first excited plus - parity state having the total angular momentum 0 .",
    "but according to the amd - hf calculation of the lowest minus - parity state , we do nt have good parity @xmath6=@xmath10 and @xmath6=@xmath5 levels but one parity - mixing level .",
    "in addition , the levels except this one are eigenstates of parity . therefore in this case",
    "we can easily make the first excited plus - parity state from the lowest minus - parity state only by projecting out from the intrinsic state of the lowest minus - parity state the plus - parity state : i.e. when the lowest minus - parity state @xmath132 is represented with its intrinsic state @xmath133 as @xmath134 is formed as @xmath135 may not be orthogonal to the lowest plus - parity state @xmath136 whose value of @xmath12 is 0.381 . in order to avoid the mixing of this lowest plus - parity state",
    ", we orthogonalize @xmath137 to @xmath136 as below : @xmath138 and @xmath139 are not the eigenstates of the total angular momentum , we can calculate the approximate energies of the projected states as below . for a given intrinsic state @xmath30 , the approximate expression for the energy @xmath140 of the projected state with angular momentum _",
    "i _ is @xmath141    = 0.66    in fig.5 , we show the projected energies of @xmath1be states as functions of @xmath12 . according to fig.5 , the minimum energy and @xmath12 of each state is as below .",
    "@xmath142 therefore we can see that the first excited",
    "0@xmath0 state appears in the vicinity of the lowest 1@xmath2 state with the small energy difference of 1.95 mev .    as mentioned previously ,",
    "the amd wave functions of be isotopes have the core part with an approximate dumbbell structure of two alpha clusters .",
    "therefore the inter - alpha distance is also useful as a measure of the deformation of be isotopes .",
    "the above three values of @xmath12 for @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 in @xmath1be correspond to the inter - alpha distance , 1.99 fm , 2.66 fm , and 3.55 fm , respectively .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a new theoretical method for the study of nuclear structure , which we have called the ",
    "amd + hartree - fock  method ( amd+hf ) .",
    "the purpose of introducing this new method is to develop the amd approach by incorporating into it the concept of the single particle motion in the mean field .",
    "the new method consists of the following two steps . in the first step we construct the amd wave function by using usual amd method .",
    "then in the next step we extract the physical single particle motion in the mean field which is contained in the amd wave function .",
    "this is done by diagonalizing the hartree - fock hamiltonian in the functional space spanned by the single particle wave functions which constitute the amd wave function . in this paper , for the sake of simplicity , we represented the amd single particle wave function by the single gaussian wave packet .",
    "but for the better description of the single particle motion we had better to represent the amd single particle wave function by the superposition of gaussian wave packets .",
    "once we obtain the physical single particle wave functions in the mean field , we can utilize them for many purposes .",
    "first we can use them for understanding the physical situation of the ground state ( or the ground rotational band states ) of the system which the amd wave function describes .",
    "second we can use them for constructing the wave functions for the excited states of the system by constituting the particle - hole configurations . the latter way of utilizing the physical single particle wave functions in the mean field is beyond the scope of the ordinary amd approach .",
    "the amd+hf method is applicable for any nuclei , but it is expected to be especially useful for the study of unstable nuclei . the reason is as follows .",
    "the original amd itself has proved to be very powerful for the study of unstable nuclei , which has been largely due to its basic character that it needs no model assumptions such as the axial symmetric deformation and the existence of the clusters .",
    "however , this merit of the original amd means at the same time that we need to perform adequate analyses of the obtained amd wave function in order to clarify the physics which the amd wave function contains . as an example",
    "let us consider be isotopes which we have treated in this paper . according to the amd study of",
    "be isotopes , the wave function of be isotopes have the core part with an approximate dumbbell structure of two alpha clusters even for very neutron - rich isotopes near neutron dripline . then there naturally arise questions about what kind of dynamics governs so many neutrons distributed around the core part and about what kinds of interaction are existent between the core part and the neutrons .",
    "our new approach , amd+hf , can give us important information in answering to these questions .",
    "it should be noted that the amd+hf method inherits most of the advantageous features of the original amd .",
    "we need no model assumptions , we can perform variational calculation after projecting parity , we can use realistic effective nuclear force with finite range , we can perform angular momentum projection rather easily , we can superpose slater determinants with no difficulty , and so on . here",
    "we make a comment about the superposition of slater determinants . in performing the ordinary amd calculation",
    ", the superposition of slater determinants causes no problem as was reported in previous papers .",
    "what we need to comment here is about the extraction of the single particle wave functions in the mean field contained in the superposed slater determinants . in this paper , we have explained how to extract the mean field only in the case where the amd wave function is expressed by a single slater determinant . in the general case of the amd wave function given by superposed slater determinants , we first calculate the single particle density matrix from amd wave function .",
    "then we can calculate the hartree - fock type single particle hamiltonian by the use of the density matrix .",
    "we will discuss this generalization elsewhere .    as was pointed out in previous papers ,",
    "the amd method which adopts a single gaussian wave packet for the single particle wave function is not suitable for the description of the long tails of the neutron halo orbits . for halo phenomena we have to adopt a superposition of gaussian wave packets for the single particle wave function .",
    "however to represent all the single particle wave functions by the superposition of many gaussian wave packets means a very heavy computational work .",
    "one of the aims of the amd+hf method is to make more adequate description of the long tails of neutron halo orbits than the ordinary amd method . by using the amd+hf method we can identify the least bound neutron orbits which correspond to neutron halo orbits .",
    "what is necessary for us is to improve the single particle wave functions only for these least bound neutron orbits .",
    "thus we expect that the amd+hf method will enable us to treat neutron halo orbits in more efficient way than the usual amd method .",
    "we will discuss this problem elsewhere .",
    "generally speaking , the deformation of excited states is different from that of the ground state . therefore in order to construct the wave functions with particle - hole excited configurations",
    ", we have to prepare the single particle wave functions for various magnitudes of quadrupole deformation . in this paper",
    ", we first calculated the minimum - energy amd wave functions for various magnitudes of deformation by the use of the frictional cooling method under the constraint of the deformation and then extracted the single particle orbits from the obtained amd wave functions .",
    "the investigation of the properties of the obtained single particle wave functions including the deformation - dependence of the single particle energies have shown that these amd - hf orbits as functions of quadrupole deformation are rather similar to the single particle orbits of the two - center shell model quoted in section i. in spite of the overall similarity between amd - hf orbits and two - center shell model orbits , there exist some interesting differences . among them",
    "the appearance of the parity - mixed amd - hf orbits is remarkable since it is out of the scope of the two - center shell model .",
    "a good example of the parity - mixed amd - hf orbit is the least bound orbit extracted from the minus - parity amd wave function of @xmath1be .",
    "this orbit comes down in energy for large deformation and can be regarded as corresponding to the  halo orbit  .    in this paper",
    "we have studied be isotopes by our new amd+hf method . however",
    "the application of the amd+hf method to the study of excited states by constructing the wave functions with particle - hole excited configurations has been made only for one problem , namely the study of the second 0@xmath0 state of @xmath1be at 6.18 mev . according to the calculation reported in this paper , the 0@xmath0 state with the configuration of the two valence neutrons occupying the valence halo orbit which is parity mixed",
    "have the excitation energy near that of the lowest 1@xmath2 state .",
    "this result is consistent with the experimental data which show that the second 0@xmath0 state at 6.18 mev exists in the vicinity of the lowest 1@xmath2 state at 5.96 mev .",
    "we here would like to comment that this calculated result can be improved by using the density - dependent force .",
    "the density - dependent force works attractively at low density , and repulsively at high density .",
    "therefore in the case where the density - dependent force is added to the force used in this paper , the second 0@xmath0 state comes down in energy more than the lowest 1@xmath2 state does , because the second 0@xmath0 state is deformed more largely than the lowest 1@xmath2 state according to the calculated result .",
    "we expect that the second 0@xmath0 state appears more closely to the lowest 1@xmath2 state .",
    "our study of be isotopes in this paper was made for the region of @xmath146be @xmath126 @xmath3be .",
    "but of course we can study @xmath147be and @xmath148be in the same way .",
    "especially it is very interesting to study the role of the  halo orbit  not only in the ground state but also in the excited states in these @xmath147be and @xmath148be .    in summary",
    ", the amd - hf theory can be expected to be not only useful for the analysis of the amd wave function but also powerful for the systematic study of excited states in a different way from the ordinary amd approach by relying on the concept of the particle - hole excitation .",
