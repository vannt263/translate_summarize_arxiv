    "a central problem in statistical physics is the enumeration of close - packed dimers on lattices .",
    "the origin of the problem has a long history tracing back to the 1937 paper of fowler and rushbrooke @xcite in their attempt of enumerating the absorption of diatomic molecules on a surface .",
    "a milestone in the history of the dimer problem is the exact solution for the square lattice obtained by kasteleyn @xcite and temperley and fisher @xcite in 1961 .",
    "indeed , the method of kasteleyn is quite general and applicable to all planar lattices @xcite .",
    "exact results obtained in this way are summarized in a recent review @xcite for a number of two - dimensional lattices .    in the case of the kagome lattice ,",
    "however , there has been no complete analysis of the dimer problem other than studies of pure dimer enumerations most of which are numerical and series expansions ( see @xcite and references cited therein ) . in recent years",
    "there has been considerable interest in the study of physical phenomena on the kagome lattice .",
    "these range from high-@xmath2 superconductivity @xcite , heisenberg antiferromagnets @xcite , quantum dimers @xcite , to the occurrence of spin - liquid states @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the consideration of close - packed dimers is related to the ground state of a quantum dimer model @xcite . in light of these developments ,",
    "it is of pertinent interest to take a fresh look at close - packed dimers for the kagome lattice .    in this paper",
    "we consider this problem , and derive the closed - form expression f_(x , y , z)=(1/3)(4 x y z ) [ equ : result1 ] for the free energy ( for definition of terms see below ) , a formula quoted in @xcite . as exact solutions for other lattices are invariably of the form of a double integral akin to the onsager solution of the ising model @xcite , the very simple expression of the solution ( [ equ : result1 ] ) and its logarithmic dependence on dimer weights are novel and unique .",
    "it points to the special role played by the kagome lattice ( which often makes a problem more amenable ) , and suggests that caution must be taken in generalizing physical results derived from the kagome lattice .",
    "for example , as we shall see in sec.[sec : correlation ] below , the correlation between two dimers is identically zero at distances equal or greater than two lattice spacings on the kagome lattice , but this conclusion does not hold for other lattices .",
    "the kagome lattice is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : kagome ] , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are dimer weights along the three principal directions .",
    "we denote the lattice by @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 ( @xmath7 even ) be the number of sites of @xmath5 , so the lattice can be completely covered by @xmath8 dimers .",
    "the dimer generating function is defined to be the summation z_(x , y , z)= _",
    "x^n_x y^n_y z^n_z [ equ : defz ] over all close - packed dimer configurations of @xmath5 . here",
    ", @xmath9 is the number of dimers with weight @xmath10 , etc . , subject to @xmath11 .",
    "our goal is to evaluate the _ per - dimer _ free energy f_(x , y , z)=_z_(x , y , z ) [ equ : deff ] in a close form .",
    "past attempts have been confined to enumerations of @xmath12 .",
    "here we consider the problem for general @xmath1 , a consideration which can find application on anisotropic kagome system such as the volborthite antiferromagnet @xcite .",
    "we derive the solution ( [ equ : result1 ] ) using two different methods : the kasteleyn method of evaluating a pfaffian and alternately a method of a vertex model formulation , which we describe in the next two sections .     with dimer weights @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the three principal directions . ]",
    "the first step of the pfaffian method is to find a kasteleyn orientation @xcite of lattice edges .",
    "a kasteleyn orientation of a planar lattice is an orientation of edges such that every transition cycle consisting of a loop of edges derived from the superposition of two dimer coverings has an odd number of arrows pointing in the clockwise direction , a property which we term as _ clockwise - odd_. while kasteleyn @xcite has demonstrated that such an orientation is possible for all planar graphs , the actual orientation of edges for a given lattice , or graph , still needs to be worked out , and the crux of the matter of the kasteleyn method is the finding of the appropriate clockwise - odd orientation .    for the kagome lattice a kasteleyn orientation can be taken as that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ko ] .",
    "the kagome lattice is composed of up - pointing and down - pointing triangles .",
    "the orientation in fig .",
    "[ fig : ko ] consists of orienting all up - pointing triangles and every other down - pointing triangles in the counter - clockwise direction , with the other half of the down - pointing triangles oriented as shown . in this orientation a unit cell of the lattice consists of the 6 sites forming two neighboring down - pointing triangles , which are numbered @xmath13 as shown .",
    "our orientation is different from that used in @xcite .    .",
    "]    to see that the orientation in fig .",
    "[ fig : ko ] is indeed a kasteleyn orientation , we note that all transition cycles in fig .",
    "[ fig : ko ] are clockwise - odd . as all transition cycles on the lattice",
    "can be formed by deforming those in fig .",
    "[ fig : ko ] without altering the clockwise - odd property , all transition cycles are also clockwise - odd so the orientation in fig .",
    "[ fig : ko ] is a good kasteleyn orientation @xcite .",
    "this is essentially the argument of kasteleyn @xcite .    after rendering the kasteleyn orientation , we can write the dimer partition function as a pfaffian . as the analysis is now standard",

    "the decorating sites are denoted by solid circles .",
    "the unit cell is the region bounded by dashed lines .",

    "the kagome dimer problem can also be solved using a vertex model approach which is conceptually simpler .",
    "this involves the mapping of the dimer problem into a vertex model for which the solution is known .",
    "the first step of the mapping is to introduce the extended kagome lattice @xmath26 of fig .",
    "[ fig : extendedkagome ] .",
    "the extended lattice @xmath26 is constructed from @xmath5 by introducing @xmath27 extra lattice edges with weight @xmath25 and @xmath28 new ( decorating ) sites as shown . by inspection",
    "it is clear that a bijection exists between dimer configurations on @xmath5 and @xmath26 .",
    "this permits us to consider instead the dimer problem on @xmath26 .",
    "the dimer problem on @xmath26 is next mapped onto a vertex model .    the extended lattice @xmath26 consists of @xmath29 unit cells each of which is the region bounded by dashed lines shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : extendedkagome ] .",
    "the unit cells form a square lattice @xmath30 .",
    "we next map dimer configurations on @xmath26 into vertex configurations on @xmath30 , by regarding the 4 edges extending from a unit cell of @xmath26 as the 4 edges incident to a site on @xmath30 . to each extending edge on @xmath26 covered by a dimer , draw a _",
    "bond _ on the corresponding edge on @xmath30 , and to each extending edge not covered by a dimer , leave the corresponding edge _",

    "[ fig : vertex - dimer ] , dimer coverings of a unit cell are mapped into vertex configurations on @xmath30 . since the number of bonds extending from each vertex is either 1 or 3 , which is an odd number , we are led to the",
