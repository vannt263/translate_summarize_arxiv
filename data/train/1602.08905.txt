    "is the strangeness sector of the eos .",
    "baryons with strangeness degree of freedom modify the nuclear eos significantly at compressions beyond saturation  @xcite .",
    "such effects show up already in ordinary matter ( finite nuclei ) . adding hyperons to a nucleus typically leads to a rearrangement of the whole system . although hyperons are fermions , they do not underly the pauli - exclusion principle with nucleons because strangeness makes them distinguishable . as a consequence one",
    "observes increased binding energies and even a slight shrinking of hypernuclei , corresponding to a larger saturation density  @xcite .",
    "hyperons are also important for nuclear astrophysics .",
    "it is well known that the presence of hyperons in the cores of neutron stars may play important role in determining both bulk properties of neutron stars as well as various dynamical processes  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "hyperons can be formed in the interior of neutron stars when the in - medium nucleon chemical potential is large enough to make the conversion of a nucleon into a hyperon energetically favorable .",
    "actually , they can appear at densities of about @xmath5 times the saturation density of nuclear matter .",
    "this conversion relieves the fermi pressure exerted by the nucleons and makes the equation of state softer .",
    "it has been found that , the mentioned softness of the equation of state , leads to low values of maximum neutron star mass .",
    "this is in contradiction with a very recent accurate measurements of the masses , @xmath6 ( psr j1614 - 2230 @xcite ) and @xmath7 ( psr j0348 + 0432 @xcite ) .",
    "this is the so called hyperon puzzle where while the presence of hyperons at high densities is predicted by the nuclear theory is not compatible with measured neutron star masses .",
    "there are , mainly , three different approaches to study the hyperon formation in neutron star matter . the first one is based in the framework of the brueckner - hartree - fock approach by using realistic nucleon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions  @xcite .",
    "the second method is based on relativistic mean field theory  @xcite and the third one on the construction of an effective equation of state by employing skyrme - type interactions  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the hyperon - hyperon repulsion and hyperonic three - body interactions effects may help to solve the hyperon puzzle problem  @xcite .",
    "another recent review article on this still debated issue can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and further references therein ) .",
    "the hyperon - puzzle is one of the most recent issues concerning the study of the static and dynamic properties of the neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "the solution of this problem may lead to a much better understanding of a complex phenomena in neutron star interior , such as the hyperon superfluidity and the hyperon bulk viscosity .",
    "all the mentioned effects are directly related with the neutron star cooling process , the glitches and the radiation of gravitation waves  @xcite .",
    "heavy - ion collisions at intermediate relativistic energies of several  per particle supply information on the in - medium hadronic properties over a broad range in baryon density  @xcite .",
    "heavy - ion reactions at energies around the strangeness production threshold have been studied theoretically and experimentally in the past  @xcite .",
    "one of the most important achievements was the conclusion of a soft nuclear eos at densities @xmath8 , as a result from collective flow  @xcite and kaon production  @xcite studies . for further reading concerning the high density equation of state of symmetric matter and the symmetry energy of compressed matter",
    "we refer to refs .",
    "supplementary information on the in - medium properties of kaons have been reported also in ref .",
    "further investigations on strangeness and hypernuclear production in hadronic reactions have been recently started by several theoretical and experimental groups  @xcite .",
    "while intermediate - energy heavy - ion reactions give essential details of the highly compressed matter , the high production thresholds of heavier hyperons hinder their production .",
    "one the other hand , the main task of flavor nuclear physics consists in the construction of the in - medium interaction between the octet and decuplet baryons @xmath9 and @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "a possible way to overcome the high production thresholds without going beyond the nucleonic environment ( quarks ) is to study hadron - induced reactions .",
    "of particular interest are antiproton - beams because of their high annihilation cross sections at intermediate energies  @xcite .",
    "antinucleon - nucleon annihilation into multiple meson production and hyperonic resonances are the most important channels .",
    "strangeness mesons ( antikaons ) and resonances can accumulate energy and strangeness degree through secondary scattering and produce by multi - step processes heavier hyperons .",
    "up to now little is known about the hyperon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the uncertainty increases as the strangeness degree of freedom grows .",
    "experimental information on the free hyperon - nucleon interactions is accessible in the s=-1 sector ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 channels )  @xcite , but already for the s=-2 channels involving the cascade hyperon the situation is still very sparse  @xcite .",
    "concerning the @xmath12-processes with the @xmath0-baryon no experimental data still exist .",
    "consequently , from the theoretical side the parameters of the bare yn - interactions in the @xmath13 channel ( @xmath14 ) are better under control than those parameters in the @xmath15 sector ( @xmath16 ) . indeed ,",
    "various theoretical approaches with similar results for the @xmath17 channel ( @xmath18-interaction ) predict quite different results for the bare @xmath19-channels  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated in the past the formation and production mechanisms of hyperons  @xcite , fragments  @xcite and hyperfragments  @xcite in reactions induced by heavy - ions , protons and antiprotons .",
    "recently the role of the multi - strangeness hyperon - nucleon interaction ( @xmath15 ) has been explored in detail  @xcite .",
    "it turned out that different hyperon - nucleon interaction models lead to observable effects and may constrain the high strangeness yn and yy interactions at @xmath1anda  . in this work",
    "we extend our previous studies by considering the possibility of @xmath0-production .",
    "the @xmath0-baryon consists of three strange quarks preventing abundant @xmath0-production in antiproton induced reactions .",
    "however , secondary strangeness exchange processes can increase the production of this heavy baryon .",
    "after an introduction to the theoretical aspects in sec .  2 we discuss possible reaction mechanisms for @xmath0-production in primary and secondary chance binary collisions ( sec .  3 )",
    ". in sec .  4 we present the results for reactions involved in the @xmath1anda  -experiment  @xcite",
    "that is , antiproton - induced reactions including the supplementary step with secondary @xmath2-beams .",
    "we conclude the possibility of @xmath0-formation in the reactions with the secondary beam at high energies above the @xmath0-production threshold .",
    "in this section we briefly outline the current status of the @xmath13 and @xmath15 in - medium octet - interactions before discussing the relevant part of the @xmath0-baryon production .",
    "that is , the octet- and decuplet - interactions in the @xmath12 sector .",
    "the hyperon - nucleon interaction is not yet fully understood for the entire baryon octet and decuplet .",
    "however , it is better fixed in the s=-1 sector from studies on single-@xmath4 hypernuclei  @xcite and from @xmath4 ( and @xmath20 ) production in reactions induced by hadrons and heavy - ions  @xcite .",
    "the free hyperon - nucleon interaction in the s=-1 channels has been investigated in detail within one - boson - exchange ( obe ) approaches  @xcite .",
    "the rare available experimental data allowed to fix the various cross sections for a variety of elementary channels  @xcite . in - medium scattering has been also performed within the same obe - scheme and in the spirit of relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) and density dependent hadronic ( ddh ) approaches  @xcite .",
    "the parameters are determined by simultaneous fits to nn- and yn - scattering observables in the s=-1 sector .",
    "while in the s=0 sector ( nn - interactions ) there are about 4300 scattering data of high quality available , in the s=-1 yn - part only 38 scattering data are accessible .",
    "they still allow a reasonable determination of the @xmath4n and @xmath20n model parameters .",
    "thus , despite of model differences all the theoretical approaches yield similar predictions for , e.g. , potential depths and scattering cross sections for exclusive channels between nucleons and @xmath4-hyperons .",
    "remaining uncertainties for s=-1 interactions are related to the unsatisfactory experimental data base .",
    "the basic task of determining the full set of @xmath21 and @xmath22 hyperon interactions is still far from being under control to a satisfactory degree of accuracy .",
    "the progress made in the last decade or so for @xmath13 systems is only part of the full picture since this involves mainly single-@xmath4 hypernuclei , supplementing the few data points from old @xmath23 and @xmath24 experiments , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the latter are essential input for the approaches developed over the years by several groups .",
    "while the nijmegen @xcite and the juelich group @xcite , respectively , are using a baryon - meson approach , the kyoto - niigata group @xcite favors a quark - meson picture , finally ending also in meson - exchange interactions .",
    "however , none of the existing parameter sets is in any sense constrained with respect to interactions in the @xmath25 channels .",
    "furthermore we emphasize the theoretical developments based on lattice qcd simulations  @xcite and on the chiral effective field ( eft ) theory  @xcite . within the chiral eft power counting prescriptions",
    "are employed to the @xmath21-interactions  @xcite .",
    "the chiral eft approach has been recently applied to @xmath26-interactions in symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "chiral eft predictions for the real and imaginary parts of the in - medium optical @xmath4- and @xmath20-potentials are discussed . according to these studies ,",
    "the in - medium @xmath4-potential is attractive while the corresponding @xmath20-potential is repulsive for single - particle momenta close to the fermi - momentum .      concerning the s=-2 sector only theoretical predictions exist so far in the literature .",
    "among others , the chiral - unitary approach of sasaki , oset and vacas  @xcite and the effective field theoretical models of the bochum / jlich groups  @xcite are representative examples . in this context",
    "we also mention the chiral effective field - theoretical approaches .",
    "they have been further extended to the @xmath21-interactions in the @xmath15 sector  @xcite with predictive power on @xmath27 and @xmath19 cross sections .",
    "the nijmegen  @xcite models are based on the well - known obe picture to the nn - interaction , in which one then embeds the strangeness sector with the help of su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "fujiwara et al .",
    "@xcite have developed quark - cluster models for the baryon - baryon ( bb ) interactions in the s=0,-1,-2,-3,-4 sectors .",
    "note that chiral eft gives predictions on strangeness exchange cross sections such as @xmath28 and @xmath29 cross sections , see refs .  @xcite . in the s=-2 sector involving the cascade - particles ( @xmath2 ) , the uncertainties and , therefore , the discrepancies between the models are considerably larger  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated this task in a recent work  @xcite by choosing two particular model calculations for the hyperon - nucleon in - medium interaction in the s=-2 sector .",
    "for instance , the one - boson - exchange calculations of the nijmegen group in the extended soft - core version esc04 of 2004  @xcite and the quark - cluster approach  @xcite give very similar predictions for the nucleon - nucleon interaction , but differ considerably between each other in the @xmath19-interactions .",
    "as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , observable signals arise in reactions induced by @xmath2-beams on intermediate mass target nuclei .",
    "these signals show up in the amount of bound cascade hyperons inside the target and , in particular , in the production of double - strangeness hypernuclei .      in the higher strangeness sector @xmath12 the situation is still not understood . for reasons which will become clear below",
    ", we distinguish between primary and secondary production processes of the @xmath0-baryon .",
    "for the primary binary processes we focus the discussion to antiproton - proton collisions .",
    "various possibilities exist for the secondary @xmath0-baryon production , which will be discussed below .    for antiproton - proton annihilation into @xmath0 particles one theoretical work exists in the literature only  @xcite , which is based on reggeon - like calculations for rather low energies of interest .",
    "the estimations of these calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] in terms of the total production cross section ( symbols ) .",
    "the solid curve is a polynomial parametrization to the theoretical results , which will be used in the transport descriptions . at first",
    ", one can see that the @xmath0-production cross section is very low . above the production threshold of @xmath30  ( corresponding to a kinetic energy of @xmath31  or to a beam momentum of @xmath32  in the laboratory frame )",
    "the cross section grows up to a maximum of several  only before starting to decrease again .",
    "note that these scales are approximately one ( two ) order of magnitude less with respect to the antiproton - proton production cross section of the cascade ( @xmath4 ) particles , as shown and discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one can naively explain the low production probability of the @xmath0 particles , without going into theoretical details .",
    "in contrary to the @xmath4 and also the cascade hyperons , the decuplet @xmath0-particle consists uniquely of three strange quarks . these have to be generated in intermediate flavor exchange processes during the antiproton - proton annihilation .",
    "also the heavy @xmath0-mass further reduces the phase - space with respect to the corresponding @xmath4 and @xmath2 phase - space factors .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-production cross section becomes significantly lower .",
    "consequently , the question arises whether the production of heavy hyperons with multi - strangeness degree of freedom is possible in the energy domain planned at fair . in this context",
    "one should remind , that the @xmath1anda  -experiment consists of a two - step process : antiproton - beams on a nuclear target as the origin of cascade particles ( @xmath33 ) , which will serve as a @xmath33-beam for collisions with a secondary target .",
    "thus , secondary re - scattering may contribute to @xmath0-production as well .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the cross sections for some particular secondary processes .",
    "obviously we select such processes with the highest strangeness degree of freedom in the initial channel .",
    "that is , re - scattering between antikaons and other hyperons with @xmath13 ( panels on top in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) or between the cascade particles with other non - strange baryons or mesons ( panels on the bottom in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . in principle",
    ", these cross sections can be evaluated within chiral eft approaches . however , in view of the limited energy range accessible in the eft approach and the persisting sizeable bands of uncertainty , in the present study we prefer to use phenomenological cross sections extracted directly from elementary events by means of the pythia program  @xcite . at first",
    ", the particle energies should lie above the corresponding @xmath0-production thresholds . with the @xmath0-mass of @xmath34",
    "this results to a threshold of @xmath35  for the @xmath36-channel ( corresponding to @xmath37  kinetic energy or to @xmath38  beam momentum ) . according to these calculations high energy @xmath2-beams",
    "are necessary to enforce the formation of @xmath0-baryons from second chance binary collisions , as shown in the bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "note that the order of magnitude of these cross sections ( -region ) is comparable with the typical strangeness production cross sections ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the hyperons and kaons , respectively ) .",
    "furthermore the @xmath0-production cross sections for primary @xmath43-channels is several orders of magnitude less with respect to the re - scattering cross sections .",
    "obviously , high energy @xmath2-beams with rather heavy - mass nuclear targets might be necessary to produce @xmath0-particles with high probability .",
    "this is the topic of the next section .",
    "for the theoretical realization of hadron - induced reactions we use the widely established relativistic boltzmann - uheling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) transport approach  @xcite .",
    "the kinetic equations are performed numerically within the giessen - buu ( gibuu ) transport model  @xcite .",

    "for the @xmath0-mean field one could use again the quark - counting argument .",
    "however , as we will see below , directly produced heavy baryons like the @xmath0 escape immediately from the nuclear environment , thus inhibiting the formation of bound states .",
    "important for captured @xmath0-particles inside nuclear matter will be secondary scattering processes . for the in - medium potential of the @xmath0-baryon we use here the same potential as that for the nucleons for simplicity .",
    "the collision term includes all necessary binary processes for ( anti)baryon-(anti)baryon , meson - baryon and meson - meson scattering and annihilation  @xcite . for more details of the corresponding mean - field and cross section parameters we refer to refs .",
    "relevant for the present work is the implementation of the new parametrizations for the @xmath61-scattering , as discussed in the previous section . having the cross sections for all exclusive elementary channels of interest , the collision integral of the transport equation",

    "we have performed transport calculations for antiproton - induced reactions including the second - step process of @xmath33-collisions on a secondary nuclear target .",
    "we have used two different target nuclei , @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the @xmath3- and @xmath2-induced reactions , respectively . for the antiproton - nucleus reactions a heavier target",
    "is used to increase the rare @xmath0-production via secondary scattering , while in the @xmath2-induced reactions a lighter target is sufficient for the same purpose . in extension to our previous work high energy secondary cascade - beam",

    "this is shown in fig .",

    "the density is calculated at the origin of the corresponding nuclear target .",
    "note that the compressions of the matter is less pronounced in @xmath3-induced reactions with respect to the @xmath2-nucleus collisions .",
    "this result seems surprising , since the in - medium antibaryon is very attractive in rmf , as discussed in ref .",
    "also note that a heavier nucleus is used in the @xmath3-induced reactions .",
    "however , the imaginary part of the in - medium antiproton optical potential is rather strong  @xcite .",
    "it causes immediate annihilation already at the nuclear surface before deeper penetration of the antiproton . consequently , the density averaged over the events does not differ much from the saturation value .",

    "cause a moderate compression at the center of the target . in the subsequent de - excitation stage the central baryon density decreases due to particle emission . in such reactions densities close to saturation @xmath65",
    "are achieved and , thus , one can probe the in - medium interactions in this density range .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the results of the transport calculations in terms of rapidity spectra of various produced hyperons for @xmath3-induced reactions at different beam energies .",
    "we observe an abundant production of the lightest hyperon ( @xmath4 ) with a broad spectral distribution in longitudinal momentum followed by the production of the cascade particles .",
    "the big differences in their production yields arise from the smaller annihilation cross section into cascade particles relative to that into the @xmath66-channel .",
    "note that here secondary re - scattering is mainly responsible for the breadth of the rapidity spectra .",
    "it causes the capture of these hyperons inside the target nucleus ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 rapidity yields ) with the subsequential formation of @xmath4-hypernuclei .",
    "we do not go into further details concerning the formation of hypernuclei .",
    "this task has been studied in the past in detail in previous works  @xcite .",
    "we focus now on the formation of the heavy @xmath0-hyperon .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that the @xmath0-production is a very rare process in antiproton - induced reactions at beam energies just close to the @xmath0-production threshold of @xmath69 .",
    "we emphasize that we have analyzed around @xmath47 millions of transport - theoretical events for each incident energy .",
    "the main reason for the low production yields of the @xmath0-baryon is the extremely low annihilation cross section of several  only .",
    "this value is far below the annihilation cross section of other exclusive processes .",
    "the major contribution to the annihilation cross section comes from multiple meson production  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the origin of the produced @xmath0-particles is nt @xmath70-annihilation , but other secondary processes involving re - scattering between antikaons , antikaonic resonances with hyperonic resonances ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "for instance , for the reaction @xmath72 at @xmath47  incident energy these secondary scattering processes contribute with a cross section of @xmath73  to the total @xmath0-production yield with a cross section of @xmath74 .",

    "this decuplet - hyperon is heavy causing high production thresholds . as discussed above , secondary re - scattering",
    "including intermediate production of high - mass hyperonic resonances can be a more favorable possibility for @xmath0-production . due to the high strangeness value of this baryon",
    "the entrance channel should have as high as possible strangeness degree .",

    "they show the expected broad spectrum in rapidity ( dashed curves ) due to the enhanced multiple re - scattering .",
    "latter causes also here their abundant capture inside the target nucleus , as shown by the dotted - dashed curves .",
    "the rapidity distributions of the cascade particles ( dotted curves ) are obviously peaked around the beam - value , but there is a significant contribution to lower rapidities too .",
    "this feature is again due to the secondary scattering , as discussed in previous works  @xcite .",
    "the production of bound cascade hyperons ( dotted - dotted - dashed curves ) is now enhanced .",

    "the formation dynamics of the decuplet - particles here is similar to the dynamical production of the cascade particles in @xmath3-induced reactions ( for comparison see fig .",

    "these different dynamical formations between the @xmath2- and @xmath0-particles have physical reasons beyond the trivial ones ( slightly different target masses and beam - energies ) .",
    "the decuplet particles are much heavier and carry one additional strangeness degree of freedom .",
    "latter property causes multi - particle final states in many secondary processes of @xmath0-production due to strangeness conservation .",
    "for instance , in binary collisions between the cascade - beam with other nucleons three final - state particles are required to conserve strangeness and baryon numbers .",
    "this leads to rather high threshold energies .",
    "the @xmath0-production thresholds are also high in other secondary processes between the abundantly produced antikaons @xmath80 with hyperons or hyperonic resonances @xmath81 .",

    "the probability of secondary @xmath0-scattering is low and they escape most likely the nucleus .",
    "another interesting result is , that the @xmath0-formation is pronounced largely in @xmath2-nucleus collisions relative to the antiproton - induced reactions .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0-production cross sections are in the range between @xmath82  for the incident @xmath2-energies under consideration .",

    "the other secondary processes with the major contribution to the @xmath0-multiplicity involve scattering between cascade resonances ( @xmath89 ) with nucleons and scattering between antikaons ( @xmath90 ) with hyperonic resonances ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "furthermore , with increasing beam energy channels with higher - mass resonances open , in particular , those channels with the hyperonic resonances .",
    "therefore , the contributions from @xmath88-scattering ( with @xmath91 being non - strange resonances ) drops as the energy increases . finally , the secondary scattering between cascade particles and non - strange mesons ( @xmath86-channel ) opens at higher energies only .",
    "in general , secondary processes with a hyperonic resonance @xmath79 in the initial channel together with the @xmath19-collisions mainly contribute to the production of @xmath0-baryons .",
    "we predict total @xmath0-production yields of several  in the second - step @xmath2-induced reactions and conclude the importance of the @xmath1anda  -proposal towards the investigation of multi - strange in - medium hadronic interactions .",
    "in particular , as pointed out in the previous sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , many theoretical models , for instance the chiral eft calculations , provide us with elastic and quasi - elastic cross sections for scattering processes between the cascade baryon ( @xmath2 ) and the lighter @xmath4- and @xmath20-hyperons .",
    "due to the importance of these secondary binary collisions to the dynamical formation of @xmath0-baryons , the @xmath2-nucleus reactions of the @xmath1anda  -experiment may serve to better constrain the still existing uncertainties in these theoretical approaches .",
    "in summary , we have continued our previous investigations on multi - strangeness hypernuclear physics towards the decuplet - sector of su(3 ) symmetry by considering the propagation and formation of the heavy @xmath0-baryon in hadronic reactions relevant for fair .",
    "that is , antiproton - induced reactions supplemented by a secondary beam of @xmath2-particles on an additional nuclear target .",
    "the theoretical description of these dynamical processes has been performed within the microscopic transport approach extended by the relevant @xmath0-production channels , as far as phenomenological information was available .    at first",
    ", we have studied the elementary processes leading to the formation of @xmath0-hyperons .",
    "the primary channel consists of @xmath92-annihilation into @xmath93 , for which theoretical estimations exist in the literature .",
    "the predicted @xmath94-cross sections are too small with respect to other annihilation processes .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0-production cross sections take values of a few  only , which is approximately six orders of magnitude less than the nucleon - antinucleon annihilation into mesons . on the other hand ,",
    "secondary re - scattering between antikaons and strangeness resonances occurs with much higher probability in the -regime .    in @xmath3-nucleus reactions",
    "the formation probability of @xmath0-particles is a very rare process . for this type of reactions we estimate @xmath0-production yields of a few  only .",
    "it turns out that secondary processes only do create @xmath0-hyperons with a vanishing contribution from the primary @xmath94 .    our calculations",
    ", however , support the two - step reaction mechanism at @xmath1anda  for the observation of @xmath0-hyperons . to be more precise , using the produced cascade - particles of the first - step @xmath3-nucleus collisions as a secondary beam , additional transport calculations for the realization of @xmath2-induced reactions were performed .",
    "a high energy @xmath2-beam was utilized to overcome the high @xmath0-production thresholds . at first",
    ", an abundant production of the lighter @xmath4- and @xmath2-hyperons was observed in consistency with previous studies .",
    "the most important result was the formation of the @xmath0-particles in @xmath2-nucleus collisions with an observable probability .",
    "it is still an open question how the @xmath95-hyperon can be observed experimentally probably by requiring reconstruction from coincidence experiments and particle correlations .",
    "however , the production cross sections in the -region , as estimated from the present analysis , indicate a high production rate . the dynamical formation of these heavy hyperons was investigated too . for multiple @xmath0-formation the @xmath19-processes",
    "gives the highest contribution , as expected for these reactions with the @xmath2-beam .",
    "as an interesting feature the contributions from other secondary channels was significant even with a intermediate - mass target nucleus .",
    "it would be a challenge to explore such dynamical hadron - nucleus reactions experimentally too",
    ". it will be important to constraint better the physical picture of multi - strangeness elementary processes .",
    "we conclude with pointing out the great opportunity of the future activities at fair to understand deeper the still little known high strangeness sector of the hadronic equation of state .",
    "note that the strangeness sector of the baryonic equation of state is crucial for our knowledge in nuclear and hadron physics and astrophysics .",
    "for instance , hyperons in nuclei do not experience pauli blocking within the fermi - sea of nucleons .",
    "thus they are well suited for explorations of single - particle dynamics . in highly compressed matter in neutron",
    "stars the formation of particles with strangeness degree of freedom is energetically allowed .",
    "of particular interest are hereby the @xmath4-,@xmath20- , @xmath2- and @xmath0-hyperons with strangeness s=-1,-2 and -3 , respectively .",
    "as shown in recent studies  @xcite , these hyperons modify the stiffness of the baryonic eos at high densities considerably leading to the puzzling disagreement with recent observations of neutron stars in the range of 2 solar masses .",
