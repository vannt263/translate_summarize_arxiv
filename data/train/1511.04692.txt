    "@xcite discovered that the locations of sunspots drift in latitude toward the solar equator within a solar cycle .",
    "@xcite named the time - latitude plot of sunspots as the well known  butterfly diagram \" . since then",
    ", the latitude migration of solar activity has been studied extensively for a variety of solar activity indices , including solar filaments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "besides the sunspot number and sunspot area , solar filaments are also one important indicator of solar activity , which has been considered by many authors @xcite .",
    "solar filaments are prominences projected against the solar disk , which are 100 times cooler and denser  clouds \" suspended in the solar corona .",
    "they are particularly visible in h@xmath0 observations , where they often appear as elongated dark sticks with several barbs @xcite .",
    "the filaments are always aligned with photospheric magnetic polarity inversion lines ( pil ) , and magnetic flux cancellation also often occurs at the photosphere close to it @xcite . sometimes they undergo hydromagnetic instabilities , which break their equilibria and lead to eruptions . since filament eruptions are often associated with flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) which are the major driving sources of hazardous space weather @xcite , the understanding of solar filaments becomes crucial in space weather research @xcite .",
    "several features of solar filaments might be meaningful , such as the location , size , tilt angle , and barbs .",
    "these features vary over a wide range @xcite .",
    "solar filaments are distributed around the whole solar disk , from the solar equator to polar regions during the whole period of each solar cycle .",
    "such a distribution is not random , it actually traces the special magnetic pils on the solar surface .",
    "hence both the location and the tilt angle provide useful insight into the nature of the solar magnetic field , which is determined by the emergence and diffusion of sunspots @xcite .",
    "the size of a filament might determine the size of the two - ribbon flare after the filaments erupts .",
    "barbs are another important feature since it might disclose the secret of the magnetic configuration of the filament . in order to figure out the magnetic configuration of filaments ,",
    "several models have been constructed , such as wire model @xcite and flux rope model @xcite .",
    "recently , with the help of the relatively high - resolution observations and the available data of vector magnetic filed , @xcite and @xcite found that the filaments sometimes have a complex magnetic structure which formed partly by a flux rope and partly by a dipped arcade , and the difference can be revealed directly by the orientation of barbs @xcite .    in order to derive all these information on filaments",
    ", automated pattern recognition method should be developed .",
    "since @xcite combined the intensity threshold and region growing method to develop an algorithm to automatically detect the growth and the disappearance of filaments , a number of automated filament detection using appropriate algorithms have been developed in the past decade @xcite .",
    "recently , we have improved our filament automated detection method in our previous works @xcite .",
    "besides the algorithms applied in our previous method , we also adopt a cascading hough circle detector to find and dually check the center location and the radius of the solar disk ; use the polynomial surface fitting technique to correct the unbalanced luminance ; build an adaptive filter based on the otsu s method to find an optimum threshold in order to segment filament and non - filament features .    in this paper",
    ", we use our improved filament automatic detection method to process full disk h@xmath0 data mainly obtained by big bear solar observatory ( bbso ) from 1988 to 2013 .",
    "we focus on analyzing the processed results in order to find statistical characteristics of the filament features . in section",
    "[ methods ] , we describe the improvement of our automatic detection algorithm . we give the results of automatically detected filament features in section  [ results ] , and our discussion and conclusion are given in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "we described our efficient and versatile automated detecting and tracing algorithm for solar filaments extensively in our previous work @xcite . here , we only highlight and explain the improvements of our method in the following subsections .",
    "the changing distance between the earth and the sun can cause the variation of the solar radius .",
    "besides , h@xmath0 images obtained by different telescopes may also have different values of the solar radius in units of pixels .",
    "therefore , the first step of the image processing is to determine the solar disk center and the solar radius in the images . in our previous work , we applied the canny edge detection technique to separate filaments in addition to obtain the limb of the solar disk .",
    "we then used the circle fitting algorithms proposed by @xcite and @xcite to fit the solar limb and calculate the geometric center and the radius of the fitted circle . here , we introduce a method called cascading hough circle detector which was presented by @xcite , and combine it with our previous method to dually pre - process the data in order to accurately determine and check the center location and the radius of the solar disk .",
    "if the difference between the values obtained with the two methods is greater than 2 pixels , the detected results will be treated as failure and the data will be automatically recorded for further manual check .",
    "these two methods perform quite well in the test data base , only less than 5@xmath4 of all the images need to be further manually checked .      since the data used in our previous work were relatively good",
    ", we only need to remove the effect of limb - darkening",
    ". however , the non - uniform brightness is not only caused by limb - darkening , but also by clouds in the earth atmosphere or dusts on the telescope lens , and so on . in order to process the data within a long time interval and from various observatories ,",
    "we adopt a more efficient brightness non - uniformity correcting method , i.e. , the polynomial surface fitting technique , which was also applied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the detailed description of this method can be found in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the only modification here is that we process the pixels within the detected solar disk instead of the whole image .",
    "frequently people use an appropriate global - threshold to filter out the bright features such as plages and flares in order to get the dark features , such as filaments and sunspots in the h@xmath0 images .",
    "this method works well for the data from one observatory .",
    "in other words , if the data are obtained through various observatories , the global threshold is not appropriate since the seeing conditions and the image qualities are different from one to another .",
    "therefore , an adaptive threshold filter is needed to process h@xmath0 data from different observatories .",
    "we designed an adaptive threshold filter based on otsu s method @xcite .",
    "the algorithm assumes that each image contains two classes of pixels or a bi - modal histogram ( e.g. , foreground and background , here the foreground includes dark features such as filaments and sunspots , whereas the background includes other features ) , then calculates the optimum threshold separating those two classes so that their combined spread ( intra - class variance ) is minimal ( or , conversely , to maximize the between - class variance ) .",
    "the procedure of the algorithm is detailed as below .",
    "assuming that the input image is @xmath5 which is represented in @xmath6 grayscale levels .",
    "the number of pixels at level @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath8 and the total number of the pixels it contains is @xmath9 .",
    "the probability of the @xmath7th grayscale level is @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the pixels are dichotomized into two classes , i.e. , background and object ( filaments here ) , by a threshold at level @xmath12 . in otsu s method",
    "we exhaustively search for the threshold that maximizes the between - class variance : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the probability of each class , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the weighted mean level of each class , and @xmath18 is the weighted mean level of the whole original image @xmath5 .",
    "formula ( [ eq1 ] ) is the original otsu algorithm , the following formula is the modified otsu algorithm that we used : @xmath19 compared to formula ( [ eq1 ] ) , formula ( [ eq1.2 ] ) avoids the decimal rounding errors resulting from the multiplication between the pixel grayscale and its probability , and also has a higher efficiency .",
    "then , the optimal threshold @xmath20 is taken so that @xmath21 we scan through all possible thresholds ( @xmath22 ) and obtain the threshold @xmath23 which makes @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) maximal .",
    "the value of @xmath26 will be treated as the threshold to filter out non - filament structures .",
    "it is noticed that filaments occupy only a small part of the solar disk , therefore , the number of corresponding pixels is very small .",
    "when applying otsu s method , we found that the resulting threshold is usually higher than the proper threshold so that the non - filament structures are not filtered out accurately . to overcome this shortcoming , here we introduce the mean grayscale level of the pixels within solar disk as @xmath27 to adjust the threshold : @xmath28 @xmath29 is the final threshold we use for the adaptive threshold to filter out the non - filament structures . @xmath0 and @xmath30 are the adjustment coefficients .",
    "we tested several hundred images that obtained by various observatories at different times and found the appropriate values for them to be @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "our method can identify several filament features , such as the location , perimeter , area , spine , filament direction , tilt angle , and barbs .",
    "for the filament spines and barbs , we introduce the unweighted undirected graph concept and adopt dijkstra shortest - path algorithm @xcite to recognize them .",
    "we then employ the connected components labeling method to identify the barbs and calculate the angle between each barb and the spine to indicate the bearing sense of the barb .",
    "the corresponding algorithms are described in @xcite .",
    "since some data in early time have a relatively low resolution , in this study we only detect the filament spines and the barb number of barbs .",
    "a filament may be split into several fragments during its evolution .",
    "we adopted a distance criterion to find the fragments belonging to a single filament @xcite .",
    "however , this method has its shortages .",
    "for example , sometimes several filaments in an active region are so close to each other that they satisfy the distance criterion . in this case , they would be recognized as one filament . to avoid this error",
    ", we add a new requirement , i.e. , the tilt angles of the fragments .",
    "if the fragments satisfy the distance criterion , meanwhile , they have similar tilt angles , they are treated as one filament .",
    "in addition , we compare two footpoints of each filament for the distance criterion instead of the geometric centers of individual fragments as used in our previous work . these changes make the filament fragment consolidation more accurate .",
    "we tested the performance of our improved method with the observations from various observatories , including the optical & near infrared solar eruption tracer ( onset ) in nanjing university @xcite , mauna loa solar observatory ( mlso ) , big bear solar observatory ( bbso ) , kanzelhhe solar observatory ( kanz ) , catania astro physical observatory ( oact ) , and yunnan astronomical observatory ( ynao ) .",
    "the test results show that our improved method is much more efficient and universal .",
    "for example , although the bbso h@xmath0 archive data observed in different periods have different resolutions , say , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 pixels , our method can still handle these variations efficiently . in this study ,",
    "we use our method to process one image per day of all available h@xmath0 data in the bbso h@xmath0 archive ( ftp://ftp.bbso.njit.edu/pub/archive ) .",
    "the available data are from 1988 to 2014 .",
    "note that their data between 2005 and 2007 are rare .",
    "thanks to the global high resolution h@xmath0 network , data from other observatories can fill in the gap . in order to maintain the data consistency we use the data from kanz .",
    "our detection method for the filament features is developed by using the matlab desktop tools and development .",
    "in addition to using matlab to implement the algorithm for the filament detection , we also use interactive data language ( idl ) with the solar software ( ssw ) library to pre - process the raw data .",
    "the time consumption of these methods is about several seconds for one image .",
    "we processed 6564 images mainly obtained by bbso from april 1988 to december 2013 with our improved automated filament detection method . in this section ,",
    "we present the statistical results of the filament features in the following subsections .        in order to see",
    "the difference of the filament features during the three solar cycles , we divide the observations into 3 intervals : from april 1988 to august 1996 within solar cycle 22 , from september 1996 to december 2008 within solar cycle 23 , from january 2009 to december 2013 representing the rising phase of solar cycle 24 . since the normal solar activity is usually applied to mean the events with latitudes lower than @xmath3 @xcite , we divide the filaments with latitudes lower ( higher ) than @xmath3 in both hemispheres as low ( high ) latitude filaments for further analysis .",
    "the numbers of the processed images and those of the detected filaments are summarized in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the latitudinal distribution of the filaments in the three solar cycles is plotted in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "panels ( a  c ) of figure  [ fig1 ] show the results in solar cycles 22 , 23 , and the rising phase of solar cycle 24 , respectively .",
    "the number of filaments in the southern hemisphere is @xmath41 more than that in the northern hemisphere in solar cycle 22 , which is opposite in solar cycle 23 and the rising phase of solar cycle 24 , during which the detected filament numbers in the northern hemisphere are @xmath42 and @xmath43 more than those in the southern hemisphere , respectively .",
    "the difference between the filament numbers in both hemispheres is less than @xmath44 .",
    "the latitudinal distribution of the filament numbers is bimodal .",
    "the peak values are within the latitude band [ @xmath45 , @xmath46 in both hemispheres for the three solar cycles , as indicated by figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we detected @xmath47 filaments from @xmath48 images during the period from april 1988 to december 2013 .",
    "the temporal evolution of the latitudinal distribution of these filaments is depicted as the scatter plot in figures  [ fig2][fig4 ] , where we can see butterfly diagrams that are similar to that for sunspots .",
    "we choose the geometric center of each filament as its location .",
    "each dot represents a single observation .",
    "there are several data gaps in the butterfly diagrams since the lack of observations in these periods . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we use the magnetogram synoptic maps from national solar observatory ( ftp://vso.nso.edu/synoptic/level3/vsm/merged/carr-rot/ ) and _ global oscillation network group _ ( _ gong _ , http://gong.nso.edu/ ) to draw the latitudinal evolution of the line - of - sight magnetic field from the year 1998 to 2014 , which is shown as color scale where the locations of the filaments are superposed as green dots .",
    "besides the well - known butterfly pattern manifested in the magnetic field diagram , we see a similar butterfly diagram in the filament distribution as well .",
    "as sunspots migrate from middle latitude toward the equator , solar filaments migrate to the equator as well .",
    "however , it is seen that filaments are distributed more dispersively than sunspots .",
    "the magnetic fields of the following - polarity sunspots migrate toward the poles where they eventually reverse the polar magnetic field around each solar maximum , as indicated by the blue and yellow stripes above the latitude of @xmath49 .",
    "correspondingly , we can see such poleward stripes in the filament distribution as well , especially from the beginning to the maximum in both solar cycles 22 and 23 .",
    "these diagrams indicate that filaments mainly migrate toward the solar equator from the beginning to the end of each solar cycle .",
    "the colors indicate the filament areas in figure  [ fig3 ] and the spine lengths in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "we can see from figure  [ fig3 ] that the dots in the period from 1988 to 1995 ( namely solar cycle 22 ) have more deep orange colors than those in the periods from 1997 to 2008 ( namely solar cycle 23 ) and from 2010 to 2013 ( within solar cycle 24 ) .",
    "it means that the filaments in solar cycle 22 have relatively larger areas .",
    "however , it may be because that the data from 1988 to 1995 have relatively low spatial resolution .",
    "similarly , figure  [ fig4 ] reveals that the dots in solar cycle 23 have more deep blue colors than those in solar cycles 22 and 24 , which means that the filaments in solar cycle 23 have relatively longer spines .",
    "therefore , we do not present the results of filament areas , spine lengths and barb numbers from 1988 to 1995 , i.e. , the period during solar cycle 22 in the following filament feature analysis .      in this subsection , we arrange the detected filaments into four groups according to their areas , i.e. , @xmath50 km@xmath51 , @xmath52 km@xmath51 , @xmath53 km@xmath51 , and @xmath54 km@xmath51 . figure  [ fig5 ] shows the yearly evolution of the number of the filaments in each group .",
    "this result is the same as that displayed in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the filament areas are mainly less than @xmath55 km@xmath51 from 1996 to 2013 .",
    "filaments with areas less than @xmath56 km@xmath51 almost dominate the period from 1996 to 1999 and those in the range of @xmath52 km@xmath51 nearly dominate the period from 2000 to 2007 .",
    "it indicates that in the rising phase of solar cycle 23 the filaments are relatively smaller and in the declining phase the filaments become relatively larger .",
    "however , the filaments with areas in the range of @xmath52 km@xmath51 are dominant in the period from 2010 to 2013 in the rising phase of solar cycle 24 .    panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure  [ fig6 ] show the latitudinal distributions of the filaments in different area groups during solar cycle 23 and the rising phase of solar cycle 24 , respectively .",
    "the results indicate that the latitudinal distribution of the filaments in any area range is also bimodal .",
    "the histograms reveal that the largest number of filaments appear in the latitude band @xmath57 in both hemispheres .",
    "filaments with areas less than @xmath55 km@xmath51 dominate the latitude band @xmath58 and those less than @xmath59 km@xmath51 dominate the latitude band @xmath60 .",
    "it indicates that the filaments in low latitudes have various sizes .",
    "the results of the rising phase of solar cycle 24 are similar to those in solar cycle 23 .",
    "table  [ table2 ] lists the quantitative results of the percentage of the filaments in different latitude bands and area ranges .",
    "filaments with areas less than @xmath55 km@xmath51 occupy @xmath61 and @xmath62 of all the detected filaments in solar cycle 23 and the rising phase of solar cycle 24 , respectively .",
    "the length of the spine is a significant feature of a filament , which can also indicate the size of the filament . according to the length of the spine ,",
    "filaments are divided into three groups , namely , @xmath63 km , @xmath64 km , and @xmath65 km .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows the yearly distributions of the filaments for the three groups .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure  [ fig8 ] show the distributions of the filament spine lengths in each latitude interval during solar cycle 23 and the rising phase of solar cycle 24 , respectively . the quantitative results of the percentage of the filaments in different latitude bands and spine length ranges are listed in table  [ table3 ] . as shown in figure  [ fig7 ] , the filaments with spine lengths less than @xmath66 km are dominant from 1996 to 2013 .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows that the latitudinal distribution of the filaments in any spine length range is also bimodal .",
    "the filament number peaks of the bimodal distributions appear in the latitude band @xmath67 in both hemispheres for the two solar cycles . from table",
    "[ table3 ] we can see that the spine length is mainly less than @xmath68 km .",
    "the filaments in this range occupy @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the total filaments in solar cycle 23 and the rising phase of solar cycle 24 , respectively .",
    "this result can also be obtained visually from figures  [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] .",
    "the tilt angle is defined as the angle between the fitted filament spine orientation and the local latitude .",
    "we set the solar disk center as the coordinate origin so that the disk is divided into four quadrants .",
    "we then use a linear polynomial to fit the spine and calculate the slope of the fitted line .",
    "the tilt direction ( i.e. , filament direction ) is defined as northwest ( northeast ) if the slope is positive ( negative ) in the first or the second quadrant ( namely northern hemisphere ) .",
    "similarly , the filament direction is southeast ( southwest ) if the slope is positive ( negative ) in the third or forth quadrant ( namely southern hemisphere ) . for simplicity , we use nw , ne , sw and se to refer to the directions northwest , northeast , southwest and southeast , respectively .",
    "the tilt angle is arctan of the slope subtract the angle between the local latitude and the solar equator .",
    "its range is [ @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "in contrast , the tilt angle of the sunspot pair inside an active region is defined as the angle between the line connecting the preceding and the following sunspots and the equator .",
    "the following sunspot of an active region tends to appear further away from the equator than the preceding sunspot , and the higher the latitude is , the bigger the tilt angle is .",
    "this phenomenon is well - known as joy s law @xcite .",
    "besides , sunspots usually appear at the latitude band below @xmath49 in both hemispheres .",
    "however , filaments are formed not only inside an active region , but also between two neighboring active regions , between an active region and the quiescent region , or inside a decayed active region which differs from its original active region after differential rotation and diffusion @xcite . as a result , filaments are distributed in much wider latitudes than sunspots , being aligned with the local pils .",
    "these differences lead to that the tilt angles of filaments and sunspots have very different characteristics .",
    "it implies that filaments no longer follow joy s law strictly .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows the yearly evolution of the filament numbers with each of the four tilt directions in both hemispheres .",
    "we can see that the northeast ( ne ) direction is dominant in the northern hemisphere and the southeast ( se ) direction is dominant in the southern hemisphere from 1988 to 2013 .",
    "panels ( a  c ) of figure  [ fig10 ] show the latitudinal distribution of the filament numbers with different tilt directions during solar cycles 22 , 23 , and the rising phase of solar cycle 24 , respectively . in order to see the difference clearly",
    ", we use blue color histograms to represent the numbers of filaments with the nw direction in the northern hemisphere and with the se direction in the southern hemisphere .",
    "we also use green color histograms to represent the filament numbers with the ne direction in the northern hemisphere and with the sw direction in the southern hemisphere . for the filaments with latitudes within @xmath73 ( namely low latitude filaments ) in both hemispheres , ne is the dominant direction in the northern hemisphere and se is the dominant direction in the southern hemisphere . for the filaments with latitudes within @xmath74 ( namely high latitude filaments ) in both hemispheres , nw is the dominant direction in the northern hemisphere and sw is the dominant direction in the southern hemisphere .",

    "show the distributions of the filament tilt angle in the northern and southern hemispheres from 1988 to 2013 .",
    "figure  [ fig12](a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) show the latitudinal distributions of the filament tilt angles within solar cycles 22 , 23 , and the rising phase of solar cycle 24 , respectively .",
    "table  [ table5 ] lists the quantitative results of the percentage of the filaments with different tilt angles in different latitude bands . about @xmath75 of all the filaments",
    "have tilt angles within @xmath2 $ ] in both hemispheres .",
    "each barb of a filament tends to be broader near the filament spine and converges toward the end point .",
    "martin and her colleagues @xcite gave reasonable classifications for the barb bearing : when viewed from either footpoint of a filament , if a barb veers from the filament spine to the right ( left ) , the barb is defined as right - bearing ( left - bearing ) .",
    "although our programs can determine the barb bearing , here we only detect how many barbs each filament has , due to the relatively low resolution data .",
    "figure  [ fig13 ] shows the yearly variation of the number of the filaments with different numbers of barbs from 1996 to 2013 .",
    "based on how many barbs each filament has , the filaments are arranged into three groups : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath7810 .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure  [ fig14 ] show the latitudinal distributions of the number of filaments in each group during solar cycle 23 and the rising phase of solar cycle 24 , respectively .",
    "table  [ table5 ] lists the percentage of the filaments with different numbers of barbs in different latitude bands .",
    "it is seen that about @xmath79 filaments have less than 5 barbs .",
    "we use the monthly mean latitude of the filaments in the northern and southern hemispheres to analyze the latitudinal migration and the drift velocity of the filaments . here",
    ", the positive / negative velocity means that the filament migrates toward the polar region / equator in both hemispheres .",
    "as mentioned above , we divide the filaments into two groups , namely , low latitude and high latitude ones which are separated at @xmath3 in both hemispheres .",
    "then we use the cubic polynomial function to fit the monthly mean latitude of the filaments and obtain the drift velocities .",
    "the distributions of the monthly mean latitudes of the filaments in each hemisphere are plotted in figure  [ fig15 ] .",
    "it can be seen that in either hemisphere the evolution of the monthly mean latitude of the filaments has three stages : from the beginning to the maximum of a solar cycle , the drift velocity is relatively higher ; after the solar maximum it becomes relatively lower . across the minimum , the drift velocity becomes divergent and the filaments migrate toward both high and low latitudes . in order to derive the drift velocity",
    ", we pick up two time intervals , i.e. , from 1988 to 1994 in solar cycle 22 , from 1997 to 2004 in solar cycle 23 for the cubic polynomial fitting analysis .",
    "since the drifting of the filaments in periods from 1995 to 1997 and from 2005 to 2009 are divergent , and solar cycle 24 is not finished yet , we do not fit the drift velocities in these three intervals .",
    "the results of the cubic polynomial fitting are shown as the red lines in figure  [ fig15 ] .",
    "since the detected filaments are mostly located in latitudes lower than @xmath3 , the results show that the averaged latitude of the filaments mainly migrates toward the equator .",
    "three panels in figure  [ fig16 ] show the drift velocities of the filaments in all , low , and high latitudes within solar cycles 22 and 23 , where the red lines and the blue lines correspond to the northern and southern hemispheres , respectively .",
    "the black dashed lines and the black dotted line show the solar maximum and solar minimum , respectively .",
    "the results indicate that most filaments in low latitudes ( lower than @xmath3 ) migrate toward the equator . since the filaments within the latitude band @xmath80 occupy @xmath81 of all detected filaments , the drift velocities in the latitude band @xmath80 and in all latitudes have similar trends . from figure  [ fig16 ]",
    "we can visually find that from the beginning to the years around the maximum of each solar cycle , the drift velocity is relatively higher ; after the solar maximum it becomes relatively lower .",
    "as for the filaments in high latitudes , they migrate toward the poles with relatively high velocities during the rising phases of solar cycles 22 and 23 .",
    "then , after the maximum they migrate toward the equator . the velocities increase slightly after the maximum , and then decrease later .",
    "the drift velocities from the beginning to the maximum have substantially larger variations than those from the maximum to the minimum of these two solar cycles .",
    "the drift velocity difference between the two hemispheres is significantly larger in solar cycle 22 compared to that in solar cycle 23 .",
    "the occurrence of solar activity features are not uniformly distributed on the solar disk .",
    "it has been noticed that more activity features occur in one part of the solar hemisphere than the other during one solar cycle .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the north - south ( n - s ) asymmetry .",
    "the n - s asymmetries of several solar activity phenomena , such as sunspot numbers , sunspot groups , sunspot areas , solar flares , prominences ( filaments ) , cmes , and magnetic fields have been investigated by various authors @xcite . here",
    ", we investigate the n - s asymmetries of the filament numbers , areas , spine lengths , and tilt angles .",
    "the n - s asymmetry of filament features has been calculated by the formulas @xmath82    @xmath83    which have been employed by many authors @xcite .",
    "@xmath84 is the normalized n - s asymmetry index , @xmath85 is the number of the filament features in the northern hemisphere and @xmath86 is that in the southern hemisphere .",
    "@xmath87 is the normalized cumulative n - s asymmetry index , @xmath88 is the cumulative value of the filament features in the northern hemisphere and @xmath89 is that in the southern hemisphere .",
    "if @xmath90 ( or @xmath91 ) , the northern hemisphere is the dominant hemisphere and for @xmath92 ( or @xmath93 ) , the reverse is true .",
    "we calculated the yearly asymmetries of the filament numbers in different latitude bands from 1988 to 2013 , then plotted in figure  [ fig17 ] .",
    "all filament numbers in the period from 1989 to 1992 show that the southern hemisphere is the dominant hemisphere . from 1993 to 2005",
    "the northern hemisphere is the dominant hemisphere .",

    "the butterfly diagram of the filaments is compared with that of the magnetic fields , and an agreement is seen between them , though the butterfly diagram of the filament is wider in latitude than that of the magnetic field .",
    "this is not surprising since filaments represent the pils that divide the magnetic fields of opposite polarities .",
    "besides the butterfly diagram , we also see the poleward migration of high - latitude filaments in association with the poleward migration of the magnetic field .",
    "a similar work was done by @xcite , who demonstrated that the evolution and migration of the magnetic field can be investigated by monitoring the migration of the pils based on the h@xmath0 synoptic charts .",
    "the filament number in solar cycle 22 is less than that in solar cycle 23 , which is opposite to the result that the sunspot activity in solar cycle 23 is weaker than that in solar cycle 22 .",
    "it is because that solar cycle 22 has 721 images less than in solar cycle 23 .",
    "besides the filament number and location , we also analyzed the area , spine length , tilt angle , and barb number of the filaments .",
    "the filament area is divided into four ranges .",
    "it is found that over @xmath1 of all the filaments have an area less than @xmath55 km@xmath51 .",
    "the filaments with areas less than @xmath59 km@xmath51 almost dominate the period from 1996 to 1998 and those with areas of @xmath52 km@xmath51 nearly dominate in the period from 1999 to 2007 .",
    "it indicates that from the beginning to the maximum of solar cycle 23 the filaments are relatively smaller and from the maximum to the minimum the filaments become relatively larger .",
    "notice that the filaments with areas less than @xmath55 km@xmath51 dominate in the latitude band @xmath58 and the filaments with areas less than @xmath96 km@xmath51 dominate in the latitude band @xmath60 .",
    "it indicates that the filaments in low latitudes have diverse areas but the filaments in high latitudes are relative smaller .",
    "there are two possibilities :",
    "one is that when large filaments migrate poleward , they may break into several pieces and the filament fragments are far away from each other , our program can not figure out if they belong to a single filament ; the other is that there are many really small filaments appearing in high latitudes .",
    "the filament spine length is divided into three groups .",
    "it is found that over @xmath1 of all detected filaments have lengths less than @xmath68 km .",
    "for each group , the latitudinal distribution of the filaments is also bimodal .",
    "the filament number peaks nearly appear in the latitude band @xmath100 in both hemispheres throughout the three solar cycles .",
    "we also find that the shorter filaments mainly appear in high latitudes , which is similar to the results of the filament area .",
    "it is not difficult to understand since the filament spine length and area are both associated with the filament size .    from the results for the tilt angle directions in both hemispheres",
    ", we found that the northeast direction is the dominant orientation in the northern hemisphere and the southeast direction is the dominant orientation in the southern hemisphere in all three solar cycles .",
    "it has been known that filaments with a right - handed twist magnetic flux rope , namely sinistral chirality , mainly appear in the southern hemisphere and those with left - handed twist ( dextral chirality ) in the northern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "filaments with dextral chirality in the northern hemisphere are usually oriented in the northeast direction and those with sinistral chirality in the southern hemisphere are usually oriented in the southeast direction .",
    "therefore , our results indirectly confirm the hemispheric rule , i.e. , most filaments in the northern hemisphere have dextral chirality with negative helicity and most filaments in the southern hemisphere have sinistral chirality with positive helicity . it is also found that the filaments within the latitude band @xmath80 are mostly oriented in the northeast direction in the northern hemisphere and southeast direction in the southern hemisphere , whereas the northwest is the dominant direction in the northern hemisphere and the southwest is the dominant direction in the southern hemisphere for the filaments within the latitude band @xmath101 throughout the three solar cycles .",
    "however , the variations in high latitudes do not as significant as that in low latitudes .",
    "these results indicate that the solar magnetic fields may have complex and different evolving processes in the low and high latitudes .",
    "we calculated the specific tilt angle distributions in different latitude bands .",
    "about @xmath1 of all the filaments have tilt angles within @xmath2 $ ] in both hemispheres .",
    "some authors analyzed the tilt angles of the bipolar magnetic regions @xcite , where the tilt angle is defined as the angle between the equator and a line connecting the geometric centers of the conjugate polaritie .",
    "it was found that emerging bipoles favor the northeast - southwest orientation in the northern hemisphere and the southwest - northwest orientation in the southern hemisphere , i.e. , hale s law .",
    "since the filaments are always aligned with photospheric magnetic pils @xcite , the filament spine would be approximately perpendicular to the line connecting the two polarities of the bipole and deviates from hale s law if the filament is formed between the preceding and following polarities of a bipole .",
    "our result that filaments have the same preference of orientation as sunspot pairs implies that most filaments are formed either at the boundary of an active region or at the interface between two active regions . besides , the bipolar tilt angle grows as the latitude increases , which is known as joy s law @xcite . in our study , the filament tilt angle does not change significantly with latitude from the year 1988 to 2013 .",
    "the difference from joy s law can again be understood to be due to the fact that most filaments are not formed along the main pils inside bipolars .",
    "only some active region filaments are along the pils between the preceding and following popalities , whereas most filaments , especially those quiescent filaments , are generally located above the pils in decayed active regions or between two active regions .",
    "the latitudinal distribution of the filaments with different numbers of barbs is also biomodal , and the peaks appear around @xmath100 in both hemispheres , which is similar to the results for the filament area and spine length . about @xmath79 of all the filaments",
    "have less than 5 barbs .",
    "we calculated the monthly mean latitudes of the filaments with latitude in the range of @xmath80 and @xmath102 in both hemispheres .",
    "then we adopted the cubic polynomial fitting to get the drift velocities of the filaments .",
    "the latitudinal migrations of the filaments experience three stages in both solar cycles 22 and 23 : from the beginning to the maximum of each solar cycle , the drift velocity is relatively higher .",
    "from the solar maximum to the years before the solar minimum the drift velocity becomes relatively lower . after that the migration becomes divergent and more filaments",
    "appear in high latitudes , marking the start of a new cycle .",
    "the calculated drift velocities in solar cycle 23 are similar to those in our previous work @xcite .",
    "these results are similar to the statistical results of @xcite .",
    "the filaments with latitudes lower than @xmath3 migrate toward the equator in both hemispheres during the whole solar cycles . since most of the detected filaments , i.e. , over 90% , are located lower than @xmath3 , filaments migrate toward the equator on average .",
    "it is noticed that most filaments with latitudes higher than @xmath3 migrate toward the polar regions with relatively high velocities , namely the so - called  rush to the poles\"@xcite , especially during the time intervals from 1988 to 1989 and from 1997 to 2000 , i.e. , from the beginning to the year around the maximum .",
    "then they change the drift direction toward the equator after the maximum .",
    "we also calculated the drift velocities of the filaments in the latitudes around @xmath3 , these filaments may migrate toward either the equator or the polar region .",
    "these results indicate that the filaments in the medium latitudes around @xmath3 can migrate toward both directions and some filaments in high latitudes can also migrate toward the equator .",
    "it is noticed that both the drift velocity and the dispersion of the filaments in the rising phase of the solar cycle decrease from solar cycles 22 to 23 .",
    "since the length of solar cycle 23 is longer than solar cycle 22 , we surmise that the drift velocity may be correlated with the length of the solar cycle : the shorter the solar cycle is , the higher the filament drift velocity is .",
    "interestingly , @xcite compared the drift rate of sunspots at the maximum of sunspot cycle with the period of each cycle for each hemisphere and found that hemispheres with faster drift rates have shorter periods .",
    "these observational features imply that a deep meridional flow toward the equator is the primary driver of the sunspot cycle , which influences the amplitude of the following cycle@xcite .",
    "after the solar maximum , the drift velocities become lower , with an amplitude of @xmath103 m s@xmath104 . besides , in order to find the relationship between the drift velocity and the filament area and the spine length , we also calculated the drift velocities of the filaments within different area ranges and spine length ranges , respectively . however , the results show that the drift velocity of the filaments changes slightly with the increasing area or spine length .",
    "in other words , the filament drift velocity is nearly independent of the filament area or the spine length .",
    "we employed a normalized n - s asymmetry index to describe the n - s asymmetries of the total filament number and the filament number with different areas , spine lengths , and tilt angles . besides , we adopted normalized cumulative n - s asymmetry index to describe the n - s asymmetries of the cumulative filament areas and spine lengths .",
    "we also calculated the n - s asymmetry indices of the filament features in the latitude bands @xmath94 and @xmath95 . the yearly n - s asymmetry of the two kind indices are obtained and plotted . since @xmath105 of all the filaments are located in latitudes lower than @xmath3 , the n - s asymmetry indices in low latitudes and all latitudes have similar trends .",
    "the n - s asymmetry of the filament numbers and the cumulative filament areas and spine lengths have similar trends .",
    "we found that the n - s asymmetry indices of the filament numbers are all negative in solar cycle 22 , which means that the southern hemisphere is dominant , which is opposite in solar cycle 23 , namely , the northern hemisphere is dominant in solar cycle 23 . the n - s asymmetry indices in the rising phase of solar cycle 24 indicate that the northern hemisphere is dominant , and the n - s asymmetry tends to strengthen .",
    "however , since solar cycle 24 has not finished , here we can not tell for sure which hemisphere is dominant during solar cycle 24 .",
    "our result showing that northern hemisphere is dominant in solar cycle 23 is not consistent with the results given by some other authors , such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there may be two reasons for it .",
    "one is that their samples are different from ours .",
    "for example , @xcite used the data of sunspot groups and sunspot areas , and @xcite mainly analyzed the active prominences in solar cycle 23 .",
    "the other one is that each sunspot or prominence in their sample is registered once , whereas in our study the data are not .",
    "we detect filaments from one h@xmath0 image per day , which means that if a filament lasts more than one day it is recorded more than once . actually , from the butterfly diagrams in figures  [ fig2][fig4 ] and the yearly n - s asymmetry indices plotted in figure  [ fig17 ] we can find that in the period from 2006 to 2008 the southern hemisphere has more filaments than the northern hemisphere . actually , we found in our study that the n - s asymmetry indices of the total filament numbers in different solar cycles have very small values , which means that the filament numbers in the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere do not differ significantly in solar cycles 23 .",
    "it is noticed that such a small difference exists only among the low latitude filaments .",
    "for the high latitude filaments , the difference becomes much larger .",
    "@xcite found that the n - s asymmetry of solar activities may be a function of latitude .",
    "here we can not give any clear conclusions .",
    "the n - s asymmetry indices of the filaments with different areas and the spine lengths show similar results as that of filament numbers .",
    "the n - s asymmetry index variations with the filament tilt angles in the latitude band @xmath94 indicate that the variation curve profiles are similar to the sine functions .",
    "the dominant hemisphere is the northern ( southern ) one when the filament tilt angles within the range @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "however , the n - s asymmetry index variations profiles in high latitudes are similar to cosine functions , through some parts are not as clear as that in low latitudes , the dominant orientation of the northern ( southern ) hemisphere is @xmath99 ( @xmath98 ) , which is opposite to that in low latitude bands .",
    "these results do not depend on solar cycle .    in summary",
