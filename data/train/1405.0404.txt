    "imperfections , such as impurity atoms and lattice defects may significantly affect the properties of real materials.@xcite this issue is particularly important and complex in the context of strongly correlated materials , where impurity effects may also be employed for detection purposes .",
    "for example , single impurities were used in the detection of superconducting pairing symmetries within unconventional superconductors@xcite and for demonstrating friedel oscillations.@xcite while cold - atom systems are intrinsically defect - free , impurities can be introduced there in a controlled way , e.g. , by employing fine - grained laser speckles,@xcite by trapping impurity atoms,@xcite or by projection of ( in principle ) arbitrary lattice patterns.@xcite even the manipulation of individual sites using off - resonant laser light or another species of atoms or ions has come within reach.@xcite the unprecedented tunability of artificial impurities provides an exciting route for probing and manipulating the properties of cold atoms , which is attracting increasing theoretical interest for impurity physics in the cold - atom context . in particular , the effects of impurities ( both static and mobile ) on a two - component superfluid fermi gas in the continuum case as well as trapped in an optical lattice were addressed in detail.@xcite    it is clear that impurities will , in general , affect local and longer - range properties strongly also in the normal phase ( with potentially drastic consequences for transport and long - range coherence ) . of particular interest is the effect on magnetism , i.e. , spin correlations , in two - flavor fermionic mixtures , as this important aspect of correlation physics is not yet fully under experimental control . more specifically , the experimental realization of the long - range antiferromagnetic order that is characteristic of effective single - band hubbard systems at ( or near ) half filling , would require further breakthroughs in cooling techniques@xcite and , likely , also larger system sizes .",
    "`` finite - range antiferromagnetism",
    "'' should be just within reach of current experiments , when using tunable dimensionality and/or frustration,@xcite but requires temperatures low enough for realizing an entropy @xmath0 per site throughout the half - filled core of the system . this constraint could be relaxed in systems with a small fraction of inequivalent bonds or sites which , loosely speaking , induce lower - entropy physics locally.@xcite    we suggest to employ this outstanding flexibility of optical lattices to get new insights into the local antiferromagnetism ( af).@xcite as we will show , localized inhomogeneities , in particular impurities , may induce anomalously large spin correlations in the surrounding at or above magnetic ordering temperatures ( or the `` spin crossover temperature '' @xcite in two dimensions ) , which can be viewed as precursors of the af phase .",
    "this fact , together with the recent progress in experimental techniques allowing precise measurement of double occupancies and of nearest - neighbor ( nn ) spin correlations in trapped fermionic systems,@xcite could provide the long sought key to the realization and manipulation of quantum magnetism in trapped fermionic systems on optical lattices.@xcite    in this paper , we consider inhomogeneous variants of the hubbard model in two dimensions , i.e. , we study correlated anderson - hubbard - type impurities in a correlated hubbard - type background , as appears adequate in the cold - atom context .",
    "this is a quite challenging problem already in the one - dimensional case , for which several specialized techniques exist , most notably the bethe ansatz and the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) approach .",
    "however , also the physics of hubbard chains is very special so that previous dmrg results for the impurity impact on spin correlations@xcite are not directly relevant in higher dimensions . in the limit of a weakly correlated background and for a single impurity ( and uniform hopping )",
    ", our model reduces to the wolff model,@xcite which is closely related to the anderson impurity model@xcite and the kondo model;@xcite the latter two have been of prime theoretical interest for decades .",
    "more recently , various extensions to correlated hosts have been considered , e.g. , in the context of high-@xmath1 superconductivity.@xcite the impact of localized defects on the spin physics of insulating systems ( i.e. , for a strongly correlated host ) in two dimensions has been modelled via vacancies in the heisenberg model@xcite and via sites with extra external couplings;@xcite we will relate our work to some of these studies in the following .",
    "the main results of this paper are based on direct determinantal quantum monte carlo simulations of the systems of interest , i.e. , are exact in the limit of vanishing trotter discretization and up to statistical errors . in addition , we provide data obtained using a real - space extension ( i.e. , going beyond the so - called local density approximation ) of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft).@xcite this comparison helps in identifying the essential physics generating the observed correlation patterns .",
    "at the same time , our assessment of the real - space dmft points out important limitations of this popular approximation .",
    "we consider the single - band hubbard hamiltonian @xmath2 with ( in general ) bond - dependent hopping amplitudes @xmath3 between nearest neighbors and ( in general ) site - specific local interactions @xmath4 ; @xmath5 denote spin - resolved densities . particle - hole symmetry ( at zero chemical potential )",
    "guaranties half filling at each site : @xmath6 , thereby avoiding the sign problem in determinantal quantum monte carlo calculations .    in the homogeneous case ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) and on a simple cubic lattice , the model ( [ eq : hubbard ] ) exhibits long - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) order at low temperatures @xmath9 , corresponding to a critical entropy per particle @xmath10.@xcite even at elevated temperatures , strong af correlations remain dominant in the paramagnetic phase , roughly up to the mean - field critical entropy @xmath11 ; later , we will denote the corresponding spin - crossover temperature as @xmath12 .",
    "this `` finite - range antiferromagnetism '' has remarkably universal characteristics : local properties and short - range correlations depend only weakly on the dimensionality at constant @xmath13 , which makes its realization a worthwhile and realistic goal for cold - atom experiments.@xcite    the same can be expected for the nanomagnetic properties of interest in this paper , i.e. , the ( change of ) af correlations induced by impurities embedded in otherwise homogeneous systems : the essential physics and mechanisms should be very similar in two and three dimensional host systems ( at constant @xmath13 and for equivalent interaction strengths ) .",
    "we will consider square lattices in this paper , which are not only easier to simulate numerically , but also offer important advantages ( in particular , the possibility of single - site addressing ) in cold - atom experiments .",
    "we examine two types of local inhomogeneities , both tailored towards enhanced correlations . in the first case , we introduce deviating on - site interactions @xmath14 on some of the lattice sites ( compared to the homogeneous background with interaction @xmath15 ) , whereas both the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitudes @xmath16 and the filling are kept constant across the sample .",
    "the on - site interaction on the `` impurity '' sites @xmath17 was chosen to maximize the spin - crossover temperature @xmath18 , which reaches a peak value of @xmath19 at the intermediate coupling @xmath20.@xcite in contrast , the weak coupling @xmath21 chosen for the remaining sample is associated with a much smaller @xmath22 , so that we can expect to see strong impurity effects at the moderately low temperature @xmath23 ( as @xmath24 ) .",
    "the second type of `` impurities '' we are going to consider is realized by a reduced coupling to the environment : all the hopping amplitudes @xmath25 between such impurity and its nearest neighbors are smaller than the nn hopping amplitude @xmath26 throughout the rest of the sample , whereas the on - site interaction is constant for all the lattice sites .",
    "if not explicitly stated otherwise , results presented in the following were obtained employing determinantal quantum monte carlo ( dqmc)@xcite with finite trotter discretization @xmath27 and up to 100 sites .",
    "in the following , we discuss effects of impurities on local and short - range magnetic properties that could be relevant for cold fermionic gases on optical lattices .",
    "we focus on two observables that are accessible in cold - atom experiments and have a direct connection with antiferromagnetism : the double occupancy@xcite @xmath28 and the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) spin correlations @xmath29.@xcite      let us first take a look at the impact of locally enhanced on - site repulsions , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : uimp_map_dqmc ] .",
    "we consider four different implanted impurity patterns , marked by bright white dots : a single impurity site ( @xmath30 column of fig .",
    "[ fig : uimp_map_dqmc ] ) , a pair of impurities on neighboring sites ( @xmath31 column ) and two patterns with next - nearest neighbor pairs ( in the taxi - cab metric ) along the axis and diagonal ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 columns , respectively ) .     introduced into @xmath21 medium at @xmath34 .",
    "nearest - neighbor spin correlations @xmath29 ( @xmath30 row ) and double occupancy @xmath35 ( @xmath31 row ) from dqmc calculations as compared to @xmath29 ( @xmath32 row ) and @xmath35 ( @xmath33 row ) from rdmft calculations .",
    "impurity sites are marked with bright white dots . ]",
    "due to its local character , the changes in the double occupancy closely follow the implanted impurity pattern : the second row of fig .",
    "[ fig : uimp_map_dqmc ] demonstrates a local suppression of the double occupancy by about @xmath36 at the sites with doubled on - site interaction , reflecting strongly enhanced on - site correlations . by proximity effects ,",
    "the double occupancy is also slightly reduced , by about @xmath37 on the immediate neighbors of each impurity . the nearest - neighbor spin correlations ( @xmath30 row of fig .",
    "[ fig : uimp_map_dqmc ] ) are also , in general , enhanced in the vicinity of the impurities . however , this effect is by no means restricted to the bonds extending from the impurity sites .",
    "already in the case of a single isolated impurity site ( the first column of fig .",
    "[ fig : uimp_map_dqmc ] ) , the strongest spin correlations appear along bonds between nearest and the next - nearest neighbors of the site with doubled interactions , forming a square around the impurity ; here , the enhancement of @xmath29 is more than twice as large as for the bonds extending from the impurity .",
    "note that this phenomenology goes beyond the resonant - valence - bond ( rvb ) picture proposed for vacancies in the heisenberg model,@xcite where the elimination of some spin correlations ( between the `` vacancy '' and the enviroment ) enhances correlations at adjacent bonds ; in the present case , such an rvb - type explanation can not be applied since all nn spin correlations involving the nn sites of the impurity are enhanced . in the case of multiple impurities ,",
    "the patterns become much more complex : in the case of a nn impurity pair ( @xmath31 column ) , the bonds above and below the impurity pair are particularly strongly correlated ; with one extra spacing ( @xmath32 row ) , the central bonds orthogonal to the impurity pair become enhanced .",
    "we will shed more light on this fascinating physics in the following .",
    "apart from the intrinsic interest , the above systems can also serve as extreme test cases for the applicability and accuracy of the real - space extension of dynamical mean - field theory ( rdmft)@xcite , here evaluated using a hirsch - fye quantum monte carlo impurity solver.@xcite as expected , rdmft yields rather accurate estimates of local observables such as the double occupancy@xcite ( @xmath33 row of fig .",
    "[ fig : uimp_map_dqmc ] ) on the impurity sites ( while the weaker proximity effects observed in the results of dqmc calculations are nearly lost ) .",
    "however , rdmft neglects nonlocal correlations arising from fluctuations : @xmath38 .",
    "consequently , nontrivial ( i.e. , nonlocal ) spin correlations vanish in the absence of static magnetization . as the bulk parameters are outside the mean - field af phase , the dmft estimates of @xmath29 ( @xmath32 row of fig .",
    "[ fig : uimp_map_dqmc ] ) vanish exactly in the bulk ; inserting a single impurity or an impurity pair with sufficient spacing does not change the situation , as seen in the first and third column of fig .",
    "[ fig : uimp_map_dqmc ] .",
    "however , the finite ( small ) spin correlations in the second and fourth column of fig .  [ fig : uimp_map_dqmc ] indicate that already a single impurity pair can give rise to a local magnetization pattern if the temperature is not too far above the bulk mean - field neel temperature . the corresponding mean - field spin correlations , however , fail to reproduce the dqmc data both quantitatively and qualitatively , as is clear from the comparison of the @xmath30 and @xmath32 rows of fig .  [ fig : uimp_map_dqmc ] .    moreover , the true correlation patterns at finite interactions ( first row of fig .",
    "[ fig : uimp_map_dqmc ] ) are also substantially different from those previously observed@xcite in the case of two vacancies in the heisenberg model ( to which our model maps , e.g. , in the limit @xmath39 ) , in analogous configurations .",
    "these comparisons reemphasize that the spatial structure of the impurity - induced spin correlations observed in the dqmc data is by far not trivial .",
    "still , one might ask whether the patterns seen in the case of multiple impurities ( in the first row of fig .  [",
    "fig : uimp_map_dqmc ] ) can be understood on the basis of the single - impurity effects .",
    "more precisely : are the changes in the nn spin correlations induced by the impurities mere superpositions of the effects of the individual impurities or do we see genuine many - impurity effects ? in order to answer this question , we have computed the differences @xmath40 between the nn spin correlations in the presence of impurities and those of the homogeneous system . for the special case of a single impurity ,",
    "we denote the result as @xmath41 , i.e. with an index 0 ; it is shown in the top left corner of fig .",
    "[ fig : sum1imp ] .    .",
    "for the ease of comparison we consider the change in nn spin correlations with respect to the homogeneous impurity - free value @xmath42 : @xmath43 .",

    "[ fig : sum1imp ] have been obtained by adding up these single - impurity results for each of the impurities ( bright dots ) .",
    "indeed , these superpositions look remarkably similar to the patterns seen in the first row of fig .  [",
    "fig : uimp_map_dqmc ] ( and fig .",
    "[ fig : uhopp_map_dqmc ] ) ; if plotted using the same color code , both data sets would hardly be distinguishable from each other . if we , however , subtract the exact results from the superpositions , as shown in the second row of fig .",
    "[ fig : sum1imp ] , we see that a pair of nn impurities ( second column ) induces singlet - type physics , i.e. a stronger correlation between the impurities and reduced correlations between the impurities and the environment ( while this observable vanishes by definition in the single - impurity case ) .",
    "this many - impurity effect decays rapidly when the distance is doubled ( third column ) ; the slight overall enhancement in the case of a diagonal pair ( fourth column ) might be an artifact due to finite - size effects in the underlying simulations .",
    "we can conclude that , for interaction type impurities , intrinsic many - impurity effects are significant only when these are directly connected by hopping bonds .",
    "a direct experimental realization of the impurity type considered above might be difficult , since it requires local changes of the on - site interaction together with adjustments of the chemical potential on the impurity sites to keep the density at half filling .",
    "an alternative strategy for inducing stronger local correlations at selected `` impurity sites '' , namely a partial decoupling by reduced hopping amplitudes between the impurity sites and their environment , seems to be more feasible.@xcite    in the following , we choose @xmath45 , keeping all interactions the same as for the environment ( with @xmath21 ) . with this choice",

    "[ fig : nn_vs_t](a ) ] .    as seen in the second row of fig .",
    "[ fig : uhopp_map_dqmc ] , the effect of the reduced hopping on spin correlations is dramatic and differs much from the previously discussed case of impurities with increased local interactions , shown again in the first row of fig .",
    "[ fig : uhopp_map_dqmc ] for comparison .",
    "most notably , we observe a strong suppression of spin correlations between the impurities and their `` normal '' nn ( for @xmath54 , shown in the second row in fig .",

    "[ fig : imp_entropy](c ) , the resulting contribution @xmath105 ( dotted line ) accounts for a large part of the total excess entropy of the two - nn - impurity system at @xmath92 ( black triangles ) ; in particular , both agree within precision at @xmath106 .",
    "however , a significant difference ( shaded ) remains at elevated temperatures , with a maximum at @xmath107 .",
    "this second contribution to @xmath88 , to be denoted as @xmath90 is clearly associated with the impact of introducing a surface ( here by taking @xmath108 sites out ) into an otherwise homogeneous system .    while this impact could , in principle , depend on the exact topology of the surface , we may expect that the primary mechanism is a reduction in the coordination number ( from @xmath109 to @xmath110 ) of each of the @xmath91 surface sites .",
    "we should , therefore , expect that @xmath90 is approximately proportional to @xmath91 . in order to test this picture ,",
    "we have also computed the excess entropy of a single - impurity system ( at @xmath92 ) ; shown as crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig : imp_entropy](d ) .",
    "again , we can compute the surface contribution @xmath90 ( shaded ) by subtracting @xmath85 of the single involved impurity . already at first sight , we see that @xmath90 is clearly smaller than in the two - impurity case , as expected for a reduced number @xmath93 of impurity sites",
    ". a closer inspection of the surface contribution per surface site , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : imp_entropy](e ) shows that , indeed , @xmath111 agrees , within error bars , between the single - impurity case ( crosses ) and two - nn - impurity case ( triangles ) in the accessible temperature range .",
    "we conclude that , to a good approximation , the excess entropy in the fully decoupled case @xmath99 is independent of the shape of the boundaries and has contributions linear in the number @xmath88 of impurities and @xmath112 of surface sites , respectively . in the general situation ( @xmath113 ) ,",
    "all sites remain coupled and , consequently , the total excess entropy will be more complicated and specific to each particular topology .",
    "in this study , we considered in detail the effect of localized inhomogeneities on local magnetic phenomena , focussing on nearest - neighbor spin correlations .",
    "we demonstrated that at or above the spin crossover temperature impurities may induce anomalously large spin correlations in the surrounding .",
    "these impurity - induced spin correlations possess a non - trivial spatial structure , which can not be captured within real - space dynamical mean field calculations .",
    "for an impurity type with reduced hopping amplitudes from / to the impurity , we found a special structure of spin correlations that , together with its temperature evolution , suggests to use a pair of such impurities as a sensitive local thermometer in experiments with cold gases on optical lattices .",
