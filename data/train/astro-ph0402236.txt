    "@xcite initially defined narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) by their striking optical spectral characteristics : strong , narrow h@xmath5 emission ( later formally defined to be fwhm  @xmath6 by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , weak [ ] relative to h@xmath5 , and strong .",
    "these properties put nls1s at one extreme end of the so  called @xcite `` eigenvector 1 , '' thought to correspond to emission from lower - mass nuclear black holes coupled with near  eddington accretion rates @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations have revealed a strong soft x - ray `` excess '' in nls1s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , further bolstering the high @xmath7low  mass black hole hypothesis @xcite . indeed , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bbf96 ) found a possible anticorrelation between x - ray spectral slope and h@xmath5 line width , with nls1s generally having softer x - ray spectra than other agn .",
    "ultrasoft x - ray selection has consequently proven to be an essential tool for the discovery of large numbers of nls1s ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the disadvantage of selecting nls1s solely upon their x - ray properties is that it can introduce into nls1 samples a strong bias toward those exhibiting an ultrasoft excess @xcite .",
    "since nls1s are primarily defined by their optical properties , the true nature of their x - ray emission is thus difficult to determine . though it is well known that",
    "nls1s are ultrasoft x - ray sources , previous samples of optically selected nls1s were simply too sparse to determine how many , as well as whether or not a significant number of nls1s have hard x - ray spectra . with the advent of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is possible to build large catalogues of nls1s with homogeneous selection criteria based on their optical spectra alone ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter wpm02 ) .",
    "of the 150 nls1s listed in wpm02 , 52 were detected in the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ; * ? ? ?",
    "forty  five of these had sufficient counts in the 0.12.0  kev range to derive power - law photon indices ( @xmath2 , where @xmath8 ) based on hardness ratios .",
    "most of these objects were optically bright ( @xmath9 ) , low ",
    "redshift ( @xmath10 ) , and exhibited typical nls1 photon indices of @xmath11 .",
    "however , a substantial number of optically  bright , low ",
    "redshift nls1s did _ not _ have rass source identifications .",
    "the optical spectra of these objects appear completely normal ( within the limitations of the sdss resolution and signal  to  noise ) and only one or two are in regions of high galactic column density , which could potentially obscure the x - ray flux .",
    "it is thus possible that these objects represent a subset of nls1s which are optically normal but x - ray weak .",
    "only a few such objects have previously been found ; for example , rx j2217.9 - 5941 @xcite and phl 1811 @xcite . since these sdss nls1s were not detected in the rass , however , the nature and extent of their x - ray weakness could not be determined .",
    "they could emit significant flux at higher energies not covered by the 0.12.4  kev rosat band , or they might also be ultrasoft x - ray sources but with substantially lower overall x - ray fluxes than typically seen in nls1s ( i.e. , much higher @xmath12 ) . another possible explanation is variability , but it seems unlikely that such a large fraction ( @xmath13 ) would be in an exceptionally low state during the rass observations . in reality , all three of these factors probably have some bearing on the x - ray weakness of these objects , but we can not infer how many are affected by which factors , if any , from the existing data .    as a first step toward solving this puzzle , we have observed 17 of these optically  selected but",
    "rass  undetected nls1s with . due to its excellent sensitivity and low background levels ,  is able to detect objects at far lower flux levels than rosat , and its large ( 0.58  kev ) energy range allows detection of objects with harder x - ray spectra as well .",
    "our primary goals are ( 1 ) to detect these objects in x - rays , or set upper limits to their x - ray emission , and ( 2 ) to obtain rough estimates of @xmath2 for the detected nls1s . given this information , we can gain some insight as to which of the aforementioned scenarios ( if any ) sufficiently explain these rosat  unobserved nls1s . in this paper we present the results of these  observations , and the possible implications for the nls1s in our sample .",
    "a full description of the spectroscopic selection and preliminary x - ray analysis can be found in wpm02 ; a brief summary follows .",
    "the nls1s in the wpm02 sample were initially selected from the sdss early data release @xcite solely on the basis of narrow h@xmath5 emission .",
    "subsequently , each spectrum was visually inspected and a more accurate measurement was taken of the h@xmath5 line width .",
    "objects which did not fulfill the criteria of @xcite and @xcite were discarded .",
    "x - ray power law slopes and luminosities were estimated for the 45 objects with adequate rass data available .    figure  [ fig_gz ] shows the sdss @xmath14  magnitude  redshift distribution for the wpm02 sample , differentiating between nls1s detected in rass , those not detected , and those chosen for  follow - up . in this diagram ,",
    "the fainter , higher ",
    "redshift nls1s are detected in the rass less frequently , and most nls1s with @xmath9 and @xmath10 were detected by rass .",
    "we adopted these as rough limits for our follow  up sample . to rule out the possibility that high foreground extinction prevented some objects from being detected in the rass , we restricted our sample to objects in regions of low galactic column density ( @xmath15  @xmath16 , although one relatively bright nls1 in the sample has @xmath17",
    "@xmath16 ) .",
    "the resulting 17 objects which comprise this follow  up sample appear normal in all other respects .",
    "we observed the 17 nls1s in this sample with  for @xmath18  ksec each between 3 january and 15 september 2003 .",
    "the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer spectroscopic array ( acis - s ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was employed , and all observations were offset by 3  from the nominal aimpoint along each detector axis to mitigate the effects of pileup should any of the sources be unexpectedly bright .",
    "this resulted in a slight ( @xmath19 ) reduction in detector efficiency as well as a broadening of the point  spread function .",
    "neither of these effects significantly hinders our source detection efficiency , thanks to s exceptionally low background levels .",
    "these observing parameters allow @xmath20 detections of point sources down to @xmath21 ( for @xmath22 respectively ) in the 0.58 kev band .",
    "all data were reprocessed with the newest version of the interactive analysis of observations ( ciao 3.0.1 ) software employing the most recent calibration files ( caldb version 2.23 ) .",
    "we then defined circular extraction regions that were centered on each source and of sufficient radius to encompass the psfs ( typically about 45 ) .",
    "background regions were defined as annuli with inner and outer radii of 75 and 15  respectively .",
    "the ciao tool psextract was used to extract source and background spectra for those objects with sufficient flux ( @xmath23 total counts ) . additionally , we used dmextract to determine the raw number of counts for each source in the 0.50.9  ( s ) , 0.92.0  ( m ) , and 2.08.0  kev  ( h ) bands .",
    "finally , the apply_acisabs script was applied to each ancillary response file ( arf ) in order to account for the time ",
    "dependent acis quantum efficiency degradation .",
    "all 17 nls1s in this sample were detected by , 16 with high ( @xmath24 ) significance .",
    "table  [ tab_obslog ] lists the net , background subtracted , number of counts per energy bin for each object .",
    "as expected , the background was found to be low , with 02 counts per band detected in the background extraction regions ( i.e. less than 0.25 counts expected in the source region on average ) , for most of the observations . in only three cases were one or more background counts expected in the source region . due to the low background levels",
    ", we assume the errors are simply poisson errors on the raw number of source counts .",
    "we used the ciao spectral fitting tool sherpa to analyze the resulting data .",
    "background levels are negligible ( @xmath25 count expected in the source extraction region ) in all but two observations ; for these two , we fit the background simultaneously with a power law model . for the twelve objects with sufficient counts to obtain binned spectra ( with at least 5 counts per bin ) , we fit a simple power law with foreground galactic absorption taken into account statistic with the @xcite variance function , which is the sherpa default and applicable to data with few counts . ] .",
    "this model can be represented by the equation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the photoelectric absorption cross section of galactic gas with effective column density @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the observation ",
    "specific effective detector area encoded within each ancillary response function ( arf ) file used within sherpa .",
    "knowing @xmath28 , @xmath2 and the overall normalization can be found through a simple two ",
    "parameter fit to the data .    for those objects too faint to be analyzed as binned spectra in sherpa ( and to check the consistency of our spectral fits ) we employed a hardness ratio fitting method .",
    "this method reduces the problem to a one  parameter fit by disregarding the overall normalization of the spectrum ( which can be determined afterwards from the total count rate , @xmath30 ) .",
    "the hardness ratio is defined as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are now the net counts in some arbitrary hard and soft bands respectively .",
    "assuming poisson errors , @xmath34 ( again using the _ raw _ number of counts per band to calculate errors , for those observations with non  zero background levels ) .",
    "we employed two different hardness ratios in this analysis , which we call hr@xmath35 and hr@xmath36 .",
    "hr@xmath35 is analogous to the rosat `` hardness ratio 2 '' parameter , where the soft and hard bands are 0.50.9 and 0.92  kev respectively .",
    "hr@xmath36 takes advantage of the full  energy range with soft and hard bands covering 0.52 and 28  kev , respectively . again using the arf and @xmath28 value specific to each observation , we used sherpa to calculate hr@xmath35 and hr@xmath36 for a test value of @xmath2 . by iterating @xmath2 until the correct values of the hardness ratios were reached",
    ", we derived photon indices independently for each of hr@xmath35 and hr@xmath36 .      for 15 of these nls1s ,",
    "@xmath2 was derived by using two or three of the methods discussed in the previous section . as a consistency check , we compared the results for individual objects .",
    "for the most part , especially for the brighter objects , the three measurements produced results well within @xmath37 of each other .",
    "however , there are systematic offsets .",
    "values of @xmath2 derived from hr@xmath35 are nearly always higher than those found using hr@xmath36 , while sherpa fits typically lie somewhere in between .",
    "this is as expected since the soft x - ray power - law slopes of nls1s are known to be steeper than those in the hard band due to the commonly  observed soft excess ( e.g. rosat : bbf96 vs. asca : brandt , mathur & elvis 1997 , although some of this offset may be due to calibration issues as described in iwasawa , fabian , & nandra 1999 )",
    ". a slope over the entire energy range , as measured by sherpa , would be in between the two .",
    "since they contain the average spectral information , we list the @xmath2 from sherpa fits in table  [ tab_objects ] .",
    "if there are not enough counts for such a fit , we list the 0.58  kev ( hr@xmath36 ) measurement since it covers the full energy range ; for the lone observation with no 28  kev counts , the 0.52  kev measurement of @xmath2 is listed .",
    "the nls1s in this sample span a broad range of @xmath2 ( best fit values of 0.253.15 ) and x - ray fluxes from near the detection limit of about 0.002 counts  s@xmath38 to almost 0.2 counts  s@xmath38 . taking the 0.52  kev flux derived from sherpa for the twelve brightest objects",
    ", we used the pimms software to calculate the count rate expected in rosat .",
    "exposure times for each position were taken from the rass exposure maps and the expected number of rass counts was then computed for each object .",
    "three of the sources , j1013@xmath390102 , j1214@xmath390055 , and j1449@xmath390022 should have been easily detected with about 17 , 17 , and 22 counts , respectively .",
    "the second object may actually correspond to a nearby rass source which was marginally detected and not cross - referenced in the sdss database .",
    "four other objects in this sample should be marginally detected by the rass with @xmath40 counts ; their nondetection may be due to poisson error or uncertainty in the flux determination .",
    "the remaining ten objects were well below the rass detection limit .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the three bright objects may have varied by a factor of two or more between their rass and  observations , which could account for their lack of detection in the rass .",
    "such long  timescale variability is not surprising , as it is commonly seen in nls1s ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is impossible to ascertain the degree of variability in the fainter objects ; however , most of this sample could not have been detected in the rass at the flux levels observed by .",
    "it is unlikely that all 14 of these 17 nls1s were in an exceptionally low luminosity state during both the rass and  observations ; thus , at least some of these objects must be intrinsically faint at rosat energies .",
    "it is likely that some combination of variability , x - ray hardness , and low x - ray luminosity resulted in these objects not being detected in the rass .",
    "the latter two factors can fortunately be determined from these observations .",
    "the data in table  [ tab_objects ] show that many of the nls1s with low @xmath2 are also the faintest x - ray sources . to determine whether this is a true effect , we calculated the monochromatic 1  kev ( rest - frame ) fluxes using the models derived through spectral fitting in sherpa . for the fainter objects we calculated the expected flux from the best ",
    "fit hardness ratio models using sherpa , with a fractional flux error equal to @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the total number of counts in the 0.58  kev band . using the sdss redshifts and an @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 cosmology , the corresponding rest  frame luminosities",
    "were then calculated .",
    "these are given in table  [ tab_objects ] , along with the optical @xmath46   monochromatic flux measured from the original sdss spectra .",
    "the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is shown in figure  [ fig_gamlum ] .",
    "luminosities derived from sherpa fitting are plotted as filled circles , and those estimated from the hardness ratio models are plotted as open circles .",
    "this figure shows a strong correlation between x - ray spectral slope and 1  kev luminosity .",
    "@xcite found such a correlation among soft x - ray selected agn , with a stronger correlation among nls1s noted in @xcite .",
    "no such correlation is seen in their broad  line agn sample ; additionally , @xcite do not find a significant correlation in their sample of bright , optically  selected quasars ( although this may be due to the limited range of @xmath2 in these samples ) .",
    "this relation has a slope of @xmath47 ( where @xmath48 ) ; if the two hardest objects are excluded from the fit , then @xmath49 decreases to @xmath50 .",
    "similar relations have been measured for nls1s by @xcite with @xmath51 ( where the luminosity is measured over the 0.12  kev range ) , while the @xcite quasar sample has @xmath52 ( with @xmath53 ) . when the luminosities of our sample are extrapolated to the 0.12kev range using the best ",
    "fit models and the two lowest@xmath2 points are excluded , the slope becomes @xmath54 , in agreement with @xcite but about 2@xmath55 higher than the @xcite result ( note that the choice of 0.1kev or 0.2kev as the lower bound of the energy range does not significantly affect the extrapolated luminosity ) .",
    "this latter discrepancy may be due to their sample being selected from the rass , which is not as sensitive to flat ",
    "spectrum objects as .",
    "for contrast , the @xmath56 relation caused by pure absorption ( i.e. assuming a typical source with @xmath57 , determining what hardness ratio and @xmath3 would be observed with various intrinsic @xmath28 values , and recalculating @xmath2 using the simulated hr@xmath36 assuming _ no _ prior knowledge of the intrinsic absorption ) produces a slope closer to @xmath58 for @xmath59@xmath16 .",
    "most of the observed correlation thus can not be explained simply by intrinsic absorption , although it could explain the hardest objects in this sample ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "however , this would require large neutral column densities ( @xmath61 ) , despite there being no sign of optical dust reddening .",
    "moreover , it is unlikely that all four nls1s with @xmath60 are strongly absorbed ( see  [ sec_abs ] ) . a dust ",
    "poor absorber could , in principle , account for the extreme hardness and low x - ray luminosity of one or two of these objects .",
    "the observed @xmath56 correlation may be a result of differing eddington ratios . to test this , we estimated black hole masses and eddington luminosities using the @xcite relation between @xmath62 , @xmath63(5100 ) , and fwhm(h@xmath5 ) and applying the virial theorem .",
    "it should be noted that these estimates may be subject to systematic error since the @xcite sample contains very few nls1s ; however , this method should be sufficient to show general trends in the data .",
    "values of fwhm(h@xmath5 ) were taken directly from wpm02 , and the 5100  flux was measured from the sdss spectra used in that study .",
    "figure  [ fig_gamledd ] demonstrates a strong correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath64 , which further indicates that the objects with the softest x - ray spectra have the highest relative accretion rates if @xmath65 .",
    "this is probably a reasonable assumption .",
    "figure  [ fig_optx ] shows that the 1  kev luminosity is correlated with the 5100  luminosity for the bright and faint objects in this sample ( with the notable exception of one point , which has @xmath66 and may be strongly absorbed ) .",
    "we can thus assume that both the optical and x - ray luminosities provide some indication of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "as expected , a correlation is also seen between @xmath2 and @xmath63(5100 ) , though it is somewhat weaker than that between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this weakness is not surprising , since x - ray properties should physically be more closely linked with each other than with optical measurements .    although @xmath2 is directly proportional to @xmath4 , it is thought to be inversely proportional to @xmath67 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , which could wash out the observed @xmath56 correlation for some samples .",
    "for this  sample , the @xmath67 estimates span approximately two orders of magnitude , while @xmath64 spans three , so the correlation is observed . in samples with a larger range of black hole masses and luminosities ( such as the grupe 2004 bls1s ) , this correlation would not be expected and , indeed , is not seen .",
    "the @xmath56 relation would also not be seen in samples with a smaller range of @xmath4 , unless the black hole mass range is correspondingly larger , as proposed for the @xcite sample . when the same analysis is performed for the wpm02 rass objects ,",
    "no correlation is observed .",
    "instead , they cluster almost exclusively around the highest@xmath64 , highest@xmath2 members of the  sample .",
    "this is not unexpected since the wpm02 rass sample consists mostly of nls1s near the rass detection limit ; they do not exhibit the range in luminosities ( and hence @xmath64 ) or @xmath67 required to see the @xmath56 correlation .",
    "if the observed @xmath56 correlation is indeed due to differences in the eddington ratio , then it is quite likely that this  sample includes some nls1s which are accreting far below the eddington limit .      as noted in ",
    "[ sec_rass ] , j1449 + 0022 is the brightest object ( in x - rays ) in this sample and may have gone undetected in the rass due to strong variability .",
    "indeed , there appears to be a slight decrease in the  count rate over the course of the 2  ksec observation .",
    "more interesting , however , is that the spectrum of this object is not well fit by a simple power law with galactic foreground absorption , as seen in figure  [ fig_771 ] ; specifically , there appears to be an excess of soft photons over that expected from a power law .",
    "the x - ray continuum can be better fit using a slightly more complicated model ; either a power law plus a blackbody ( which yields @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) , or a broken power law with @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72kev .",
    "there is also a significant dip in flux at @xmath73kev with equivalent width @xmath74kev .",
    "this absorption is similar to that seen in some other nls1s @xcite .",
    "such a feature could be due ovii / oviii absorption in a highly relativistic outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a more plausible model may be the @xcite hypothesis of a strong fe  l complex at this energy .",
    "four of the nls1s in this sample exhibit spectra with @xmath75 .",
    "since for low count rates @xmath2 and @xmath28 are highly degenerate , no individual object is bright enough to place a meaningful limit on its intrinsic absorption ; thus , we can not determine with confidence whether this x - ray hardness is intrinsic to the accretion process or merely caused by a high degree of absorption .",
    "the spectra of these four nls1s were added together to determine whether they exhibit strong absorption as a group .",
    "we assumed all have typical @xmath76 and similar @xmath28 values at each redshift , and fit a corresponding model to the coadded spectrum .",
    "this resulted in a best - fit value of @xmath77 , but the fit is not particularly good and shows strong residuals .",
    "if we leave both @xmath2 and @xmath28 as free parameters , @xmath28 becomes zero ( with a @xmath78 upper limit of @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 .",
    "the fit with no absorption is also much better ( @xmath81 compared to the absorption model ) .",
    "based on this , it appears as though these flat  spectrum sources are not strongly absorbed as a group .    of course",
    ", it is possible that one or two of these nls1s could be strongly absorbed , particularly the faintest object ( j1259@xmath390102 ) since with only five total counts its influence on the coadded spectrum is small . if this object has an intrinsic x - ray luminosity @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( similar to the brightest objects in our sample ) , an intrinsic neutral column density of @xmath84 would be required to reproduce the observed flux and @xmath2 .",
    "the input @xmath2 and luminosity of such a model can be adjusted to reproduce the other faint , hard sources as well , but somewhat high column densities ( @xmath85 ) are typically required . moreover ,",
    "there is no indication of absorption in the optical spectra of these objects .",
    "thus , we conclude that these objects most likely have intrinsically hard x - ray spectra , although the two hardest may be heavily obscured in the x - rays but not at optical wavelengths ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at first glance , this sample appears to exhibit a range of x - ray spectral slopes extending to much lower values than previously seen for nls1s .",
    "however , the @xmath2 values listed are , for the most part , derived over a larger energy range than used by previous studies . for example , @xmath2 is measured by rosat over the 0.12.4  kev energy range for the 52 narrow- and broad - line seyfert  1 objects in bbf96 , while the 0.12.0  kev hardness ratio is used with the wpm02 sample . in order to ensure the energy bands overlap , we employ the hr@xmath35 measurement of @xmath2 for comparison to these two samples .",
    "it should be noted that the energy ranges used by these samples are slightly different nonetheless .",
    "since hr@xmath35 covers the 0.52.0  kev band , it does not extend to the 0.1  kev minimum energy of rosat , or to the 2.4  kev maximum energy used by bbf96 .",
    "however , 28 of the wpm02 nls1s detected in rosat have measurements for both hr1 ( 0.12.0  kev ) and hr2 ( 0.52.0  kev ) .",
    "we rederived @xmath2 using the hr2 measurements and compared it to the values from hr1 .",
    "although the errors are larger , the hr2 @xmath2s are consistent with those from hr1 in all but four objects .",
    "no systematic offset is seen between these two measurements .",
    "thus , we assume that the @xmath2s derived from rosat hr1 are good estimators of the spectral slopes over the 0.52  kev range . as for the bbf96 measurements extending to 2.4  kev while ours extend only to 2.0  kev , we expect this to be negligible for two reasons : first , few photons are emitted in the high  energy tail ( @xmath86 for @xmath87 ) ; and second , the rosat sensitivity decreases quite rapidly in this regime , so even fewer photons should be detected .",
    "thus , the differing energy bands should have little effect on comparing these various samples .",
    "figure  [ fig_fgamma ] shows the relation between @xmath2 and the h@xmath5 velocity width for all three samples .",
    "crosses denote bbf96 data , blue circles are the wpm02 rass data , and the 16 objects with hr@xmath35 measurements are shown as red circles with errorbars .",
    "the horizontal lines show the mean and sample standard deviation of @xmath2 for only the bbf96 data ; nls1 and sy1 averages are computed separately .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the wpm02 and   nls1s do not fall within the same range as those in bbf96 ; in fact , a significant number appear to exhibit _ seyfert 1_type x - ray spectra .",
    "table  [ tab_gamma ] lists the mean and sample standard deviation of @xmath2 for the three samples .",
    "an interesting progression emerges : as we move from nls1s which were found through a mixture of optical and x - ray selection ( bbf96 ) , to those which were selected solely based on their optical properties ( wpm02 ) , to the  sample presented herein which was selected on the basis of weak x - ray emission , @xmath88 and the extremes of the @xmath2 distribution become harder .",
    "in fact , the @xmath2 distribution of this sample extends to lower values than that of the bbf96 seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "this illustrates the effect of selection methods on building nls1 samples , as well as demonstrating the existence of a significant population of nls1s which are _",
    "_ n__ot ultrasoft x - ray sources .",
    "this  sample was originally selected as a set of x - ray weak nls1 candidates , i.e. nls1s which were not detected in the rass but had @xmath89 magnitudes similar to detected objects . to determine whether these objects are truly x - ray weak",
    ", we used the wpm02 rass  detected nls1s as a comparison sample .",
    " frame luminosities at 1kev were calculated using pimms along with rosat count rates and the best ",
    "fit @xmath2 values given in wpm02 , and 5100  luminosities were measured from the original sdss spectra .",
    "the best  fit relation between the monochromatic optical and x - ray luminosities has a slope consistent with unity , and is plotted on figure  [ fig_optx ] along with the data points from the  sample .",
    "interestingly , the rass relation corresponds very well with the upper bound on the x - ray  optical relation for the  nls1s .",
    "eight of these objects are consistent with the rass fit and another three are consistent within @xmath90 , while the rest are significantly below the line .",
    "the faintest objects in x - rays appear to exhibit a @xmath91 slope similar to that of the brighter objects ( if the point at the lower right of the plot , which is probably absorbed in x - rays , is excluded ) , but their x - ray luminosities are roughly a factor of 5 lower than those seen in the wpm02 rass sample .",
    "thus , although most of the objects in this sample are not particularly x - ray faint compared to nls1s in the wpm02 rass sample with similar optical luminosities , six of them do fall well below the @xmath91 relation due to intrinsic x - ray faintness or obscuration .",
    "through short  duration  observations of rass  undetected nls1s , we have determined that six of the 17 objects have x - ray luminosities substantially lower than nls1s with similar optical properties . of the brighter objects , at least two exhibit flux levels which should have been detectable by the rass , indicating that their luminosities may have increased by a factor of two or more between the rass and observations .",
    "many of the remaining bright objects were near or just below the rass detection limit , and were most likely not seen due to smaller luminosity variations or poisson noise . across the entire sample , a strong correlation is seen between the x - ray spectral slope @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this is probably not entirely due to intrinsic absorption , since individual spectra of bright objects as well as a coadded spectrum of the faintest objects do not indicate high degrees of absorption ( although one or two of the faintest hard  spectrum objects may be absorbed in x - rays but not at optical wavelengths ) .",
    "if @xmath2 is indeed correlated with @xmath4 , then the @xmath56 relation suggests that variations in @xmath3 are primarly due to differences in @xmath4 among objects with comparatively similar black hole masses .",
    "this interpretation is complementary to that of @xcite , who find a similar relation but whose sample more likely includes objects with a large range of @xmath67 but @xmath92 .",
    "these observations may hold important implications for the `` eigenvector 1 '' ( principal component 1 ; pc1 ) paradigm posited by @xcite and reinforced by @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "pc1 ( which is primarily driven by an anticorrelation between [ ] and ) is an indicator of @xmath4 .",
    "nls1s typically lie at one extreme end of pc1the end thought to correspond to the highest relative accretion rates .",
    "since @xmath2 is thought to be related to @xmath4 , @xmath2 and pc1 should be correlated ; indeed , @xcite find such a correlation .",
    "however , the sample presented herein contains objects which from their optical spectra are at the supposed high@xmath4 end of pc1 , yet also exhibit very low values of @xmath2 , as well as low inferred @xmath64 .",
    "these extreme objects may indicate that while pc1 is usually correlated with @xmath4 , it may also be affected by orientation , black hole mass , or other physical drivers ( as noted by * ? ? ?",
    "this is not a completely new phenomenon ; for example , bbf96 note that mrk  507 , with @xmath93 , has an unusually flat x - ray spectrum for a nls1 .",
    "this sample simply demonstrates that mrk  507 is not an isolated case , and in fact a small but interesting subset of nls1s do not appear to fit within the pc1 framework .",
    "the apparent lack of strong absorption in some of these flat sources indicates that their x - ray spectra actually are intrinsically flat .",
    "further studies of x - ray weak nls1s , as well as much larger samples from surveys such as the sdss , should offer greater insight into the mechanism(s ) behind pc1 .    due to the short exposure times of these observations ( @xmath94  ksec ) , we can not infer much outside of @xmath2 and luminosity estimates for individual objects ; indeed , this program was intended to study the group properties of an x - ray weak nls1 sample .",
    "however , there are several objects in this sample with exceptionally low @xmath2 which may be worthy of further study .",
    "these hard x - ray nls1s may represent a new , rare subclass which are optically normal but highly absorbed in the x - rays , or which exhibit abnormally low @xmath4 , or both .",
