    "susy is one of the best - motivated new physics scenarios .",
    "it can address the gauge hierarchy problem , help unification of three sm gauge coupling constants , and may provide a natural dm candidate . minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) consists of the sm fields , one more higgs doublet and their superpartners . typically , the mssm is accompanied by @xmath0-parity , which can protect proton from decaying through renormalizable baryon number ( @xmath5 ) or lepton number ( @xmath6 ) violating terms . under the @xmath0-parity , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable and may serve as a dm candidate .",
    "the mssm provides two natural lsp dm candidates : neutralino ( superpartner of neutral gauge bosons and higgs bosons ) and sneutrino ( superpartner of neutrinos ) .",
    "the neutralino lsp dm candidate has been extensively studied and proven to be a good dm candidate @xcite .",
    "many studies have been done also for the detection of the neutralino lsp signal at the collider experiments .",

    "it is basically because it was excluded early as a viable dm candidate by a combination of cosmological ( dm relic density constraint ) and terrestrial constraints ( direct dm search by nuclear recoil ) @xcite . the major channel for the relic density and direct search is mediated by the sm @xmath9 boson",

    "( for an extensive review of heavy neutral gauge boson , see ref .",
    "there are few studies in the rh sneutrino lsp search at the collider experiments .",
    "since the rh sneutrino lsp does not carry any sm charge , we can not use the methods developed for the neutralino lsp .",
    "in fact , it would be very hard to see the signal related to @xmath12 at the lhc experiments .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to establish a correlation between the lhc experiments and dm direct search experiments ( such as cdms and xenon ) for a @xmath13 gauge symmetry and discuss how we can use it to confirm the rh sneutrino lsp dm .",
    "we choose a tev scale @xmath14 gauge symmetry . as discussed in section [ sec : framework ] , this is a remarkably well - motivated ( if not demanded ) addition to the mssm , and further the economy of the model is also preserved in the sense that we do not need the @xmath0-parity independently .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : framework ] , we describe our theoretical framework . in section [ sec : correlation ] , we discuss the correlation of the dm direct search experiment and the lhc dilepton resonance search experiment . in section [ sec : analysis ] , we show various results of the numerical analysis . in section",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we summarize our results .",
    "here , we describe the theoretical framework in our study .",
    "the model we will work on is a well - known extension of the mssm : mssm + three rh neutrinos / sneutrinos + tev scale @xmath14 gauge symmetry .",
    "the rh neutrinos are well - motivated to explain the observed neutrino masses - parity , which is not within our context @xcite . ] .",
    "they are also necessary to introduce @xmath1 as an anomaly - free gauge symmetry .",
    "the @xmath14 is one of the most popular gauge extensions as we can see from the plethora of the literature on the subject .",
    "( for very limited instances , see refs .",
    "it has a strong motivation especially in the susy framework : ( i ) it is the only possible flavor - independent abelian gauge extension of the sm / mssm without introducing exotic fermions ( except for the rh neutrinos which is well motivated itself by neutrino masses ) .",
    "( ii ) it can originate from grand unification theory ( gut ) models such as @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "( iii ) the radiative @xmath1 symmetry breaking , similarly to the radiative ew symmetry breaking , in the susy may be achievable @xcite .",
    "( iv ) it can contain matter parity @xmath17 , which is equivalent to @xmath0-parity @xmath18 , as a residual discrete symmetry @xcite .",
    "in particular , the mssm already carries the @xmath0-parity in order to stabilize the proton and the lsp dm candidate .",
    "when a discrete symmetry does not have a gauge origin , it may be vulnerable from the planck scale physics @xcite .",
    "therefore it is more than natural to assume a @xmath14 gauge symmetry , which is a gauge origin of the @xmath0-parity .",
    "once an abelian gauge symmetry is introduced in the susy models , its natural scale is set to be the tev scale .",
    "this is because the masses of sfermions ( such as stop ) get an extra @xmath19-term contribution from a new @xmath13 gauge symmetry and we need to make sure the sfermion scale does not exceed the tev scale in order to keep the susy as a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem . since much lighter scale @xmath13 with an ordinary size coupling",
    "should have been discovered by the collider experiments , we can see that ( roughly ) tev scale is the right scale for the new @xmath13 gauge symmetry in susy .",
    "therefore , replacing the @xmath0-parity with the tev scale @xmath14 gauge symmetry is one of the most natural and economic extensions of the mssm .",
    "one of the direct consequences of this model is the existence of a tev scale @xmath11 gauge boson , which couples to both quarks and leptons with specific charges ( @xmath5 for all quarks / squarks and @xmath20 for all leptons / sleptons ) .",
    "we assume one of the rh sneutrinos is the lsp .",
    "it does not couple to any sm gauge boson , but it does couple to the @xmath11 gauge boson .",
    "it would be appropriate to comment about more general cases at this point , before we discuss our main findings .",
    "the aforementioned attractiveness does not exclusively apply to the @xmath1 .",
    "some mixture with the hypercharge @xmath21 ( that is , @xmath22 with some constant @xmath23 ) or lepton flavor dependent @xmath13 gauge symmetry ( @xmath24 ) @xcite are also known to be anomaly - free without introducing exotic fermions , and can have the matter parity as a residual discrete symmetry .",
    "( for some references about discrete symmetries from a gauge origin , see refs .",
    "it would not be difficult to distinguish them with the lhc experiments though .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry can tell about the @xmath11 couplings @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 is vectorial which can distinguish itself from the axial coupling provided by the @xmath21 in the forward - backward asymmetry measurement .",

    "we will not consider the relic density constraints in our study .",
    "we are mainly interested in establishing the correlation between the lhc and the direct dm search with minimal assumptions .",
    "the relic density constraint in principle depends on the cosmological assumptions ( for example , whether the dm was thermally in equilibrium in the early universe or not ) . furthermore , the channels to reproduce the right dm relic density are not unique : it may involve @xmath11 as well as its superpartner @xmath25 .",

    "the process at lhc that is directly correlated with the direct search is the di - sneutrino @xmath11 resonance process ( @xmath33 ) , whose observation would be practically impossible since it does not leave anything but the missing energy .",
    "nevertheless , a typical dilepton @xmath11 resonance ( @xmath34 ) can reveal the relevant information , because all leptons and sleptons carry the same charge ( @xmath20 ) , though the spin and mass of the final particles are different .",

    "<S> under @xmath0-parity , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable and may serve as a good dark matter candidate . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-parity can be naturally introduced with a gauge origin at tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> we go over why a tev scale @xmath1 gauge extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is one of the most natural , if not demanded , low energy supersymmetric models . in the presence of a tev scale abelian gauge symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> the ( predominantly ) right - handed sneutrino lsp can be a good dark matter candidate . </S>",
    "<S> its identification at the lhc is challenging because it does not carry any standard model charge . </S>",
    "<S> we show how we can use the correlation between the lhc experiments ( dilepton resonance signals ) and the direct dark matter search experiments ( such as cdms and xenon ) to identify the right - handed sneutrino lsp dark matter in the @xmath1 extended mssm . </S>"
