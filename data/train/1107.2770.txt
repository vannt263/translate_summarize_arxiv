    "the physics of ultracold quantum gases attracts a lot of interest since the experimental observation of bose - einstein condensation in dilute alkali - metal atom gases  @xcite . besides the exciting physics of ultracold gases by itself , a further important progress was the loading of the ultracold gas into an optical lattice formed with the aid of standing light waves  @xcite .",
    "the optical lattice resembles in some sense the periodicity of a crystal potential  @xcite , but is practically free of phonons .",
    "in contrast to real solids the lattice parameters are , in addition , easily tunable by a variation of the laser intensity , the relative orientation of the laser beams , or the wavelength . in the first case the lattice depth , in the other cases the lattice geometry can be manipulated .",
    "moreover , in the ultracold regime the effective long - range interaction between atoms is usually well characterized by a single parameter , the scattering length  @xcite .",
    "this simplifies the investigation of atomic systems in the ultracold regime .",
    "the effective interaction can be either attractive or repulsive , depending on the type of atoms involved .",
    "while different kinds of chemical elements , their isotopes , or atoms in different electronic or spin states cover already a wide range of interaction strengths , an almost full tunability of the atom - atom interactions in ultracold gases is achieved using magnetic feshbach resonances  @xcite .",
    "close to the resonance value of the magnetic field the scattering length diverges and the effective interaction varies in a wide range , in principle from being infinitely strongly repulsive to infinitely strongly attractive .",
    "this possibility of active control of the interparticle interaction makes ultracold atoms in optical lattices an ideal tool for , e.g. , exploring the properties of many - body hamiltonians describing particles in periodic potentials , like the hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "examples are the experimental studies of a bosonic mott insulator  @xcite , a fermionic band insulator  @xcite , or the simulation of antiferromagnetic spin chains in an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "a further important aspect of ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices is the in principle arbitrary filling that can be realized , while the filling is strongly constrained in usual solid - state systems by charge neutrality .",
    "ultracold quantum gases thus allow studies far away from the often considered half - filling case .",
    "one interesting limit is the one of very sparsely populated lattices in which few - body quantum dynamics can be studied very accurately  @xcite .",
    "this initiated recently a number of corresponding theoretical studies  @xcite .",
    "these investigations are often further motivated by the fact that the direct experimental control of many parameters together with the high degree of coherence that is not destroyed by phonons led to proposals to use ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices in quantum - information applications like quantum simulators or even quantum computers  @xcite . for such applications",
    "a very precise knowledge about the microscopic interactions between quantum particles in an optical lattice is a prerequisite .    at the required level of accuracy",
    "a description of the atoms as simply being trapped in an array of harmonic potentials becomes inappropriate .",
    "for example , during a controlled quantum - gate operation it is usually necessary to bring two atoms from different sites into contact with each other .",
    "atoms in different electronic states may be involved in such an operation , as those states may encode the two qubit states ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . however , in such a case the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) and relative ( rel . ) motions of two atoms even in the same potential well do not separate , even not within the harmonic approximation  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that different hyperfine states are usually accompanied by different polarizabilites .",
    "thus the atoms in different states experience different trapping frequencies even within the harmonic approximation .",
    "evidently , such a non - separability of c.m .  and rel",
    ".  motions always occurs for heteronuclear systems ( different atomic species ) with different masses and polarizabilites .",
    "experimental evidence for the corresponding breakdown of the harmonic approximation for a heteronuclear system was given in @xcite and theoretically confirmed @xcite .",
    "if the considered atoms are not tightly bound in the same potential well and thus if the multi - well structure of the optical lattice is important , there is evidently no separability of c.m .  and rel .",
    "motion , even not for identical atoms .    already",
    "the theoretical treatment of two atoms in an optical lattice is a formidable task , if realistic atom - atom interaction needs to be considered .",
    "while this interaction may often be described by a central force , the interaction potential stems from laborious quantum - chemistry calculations and is thus only numerically given .",
    "the transition to c.m .  and rel .",
    "coordinates simplifies the problem dramatically , since the interatomic interaction affects only the rel .",
    "motion and in the case of an isotropic interaction even only the radial part of it . however , the above - mentioned non - separability demands finally to treat the full six - dimensional problem .",
    "furthermore , the matrix elements describing the interaction with the trapping potential become more involved , since they do not separate in c.m .  and rel .",
    "alternatively , the problem may be solved in ( absolute ) cartesian coordinates . in this case the potential describing the optical lattice separates for both particles and , e.g. , in the orthorhombic case even for the three cartesian coordinates .",
    "however , in this case the particle interaction terms restore the non - separability of the six - dimensional problem , except for very special cases like the @xmath2 potentials @xcite where @xmath3 is the radial coordinate of rel .  motion and",
    "@xmath4 is an integer . in view of its universality with respect to the interparticle interaction the treatment in c.m .  and rel .",
    "coordinates is favorable .",
    "furthermore , as will be shown in detail below , the use of taylor expansions of the optical - lattice potential allows for a reasonable efficiency .    in this work a numerical approach is presented for the theoretical treatment of two particles that interact _ via _ a central ( isotropic ) interaction potential and are trapped in a finite orthorhombic @xmath5- or @xmath6-type periodic potential . while the main motivation is the treatment of ultracold atoms and molecules in optical lattices , the code allows also to treat other particles and was , e.g. , recently also employed in a study of electrons and excitons in quantum - dot molecules .",
    "the uncoupled schrdinger equations for c.m .  and rel .",
    "motion are solved by an expansion of the radial parts in @xmath7 splines and the angular parts in spherical harmonics . the coupling is then considered by means of configuration interaction ( exact diagonalization ) . the orthorhombic d@xmath8 symmetry is fully accounted for .    the approach was already successfully applied in a systematic investigation of the effects of anharmonicity and coupling of c.m .  and rel .",
    "motion for two atoms in a single well of an optical lattice @xcite . together with the experimental results in @xcite this allowed the conclusion that only the inclusion of the effects of anharmonicity and coupling ( and thus deviations from a simple uncoupled harmonic model ) lead to agreement with experiment .",
    "furthermore , considering a triple - well potential the optimal bose - hubbard parameter were obtained and the range of validity of the bose - hubbard model was explored quantitatively @xcite .",
    "such a study is of importance , as it provides a link to many - body physics and large lattices within the most popular model for the description of ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that in view of proposed quantum - information applications the physics of , e.g. , few atoms in double - well potentials is , however , already of interest by itself @xcite .",
    "the triple - well system was on the other hand , e.g. , proposed to serve as a transistor , where the population of the middle well controls the tunneling of particles from the left to the right well @xcite .",

    "this method was also successfully used to tune the interatomic interaction between atoms in the optical lattices , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , the correct theoretical treatment of a magnetic feshbach resonance requires the solution of a multichannel problem that is numerically demanding due to the different length scales involved . within an optical lattice",
    "the influence of the confining potential on the multichannel problem has also to be properly considered ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "to perform such a study within the present algorithm appears prohibitively difficult , at least with the computer resources at our disposal . on the other hand ,",
    "the variation of the interaction strength ( characterized in the trap - free situation and at the zero - energy limit by @xmath272 ) can be mimicked within single - channel models . in this case , some parameter in the rel .",
    "motion hamiltonian is varied in such a fashion that resonant behavior occurs . whenever the manipulation leads to a shift of a very weakly bound state into the dissociation continuum , resonant behavior ( divergence of @xmath272 )",
    "is observed .",
    "examples for such artificially obtained single - channel resonances include the variation of van der waals coefficients  @xcite , the reduced mass @xcite , the inner - wall of the molecular interaction potential @xcite , or the local modification of the born - oppenheimer curve at intermediate distances @xcite .",
    "a comparison of these different procedures and the full multi - channel treatment is provided in @xcite . as is shown in @xcite a better and in fact almost perfect model for a multi - channel feshbach resonance",
    "can be obtained with a two - channel model which appears more realistic with respect to a possible implementation within the present approach than the full multi - channel hamiltonian .      due to the choice of spherical c.m .  and rel .",
    "coordinates all integrals could be reduced to products of one - dimensional integrals that can be solved very accurately and efficiently .",
    "in fact , the angular integrations are performed analytically . moreover ,",
    "the gaussian quadrature provides exact results for all radial integrals except the ones of the interatomic interaction .",
    "however , even the latter ones can be calculated to high precision using gaussian quadrature .",
    "the compactness of the @xmath7 splines leads to sparseness of the hamiltonian matrices , since only few integrals involve two non - zero @xmath7 splines .",
    "the compactness and thus the resulting band structure of the one - particle hamiltonian matrices ( of c.m .  and rel .",
    "motion ) is controlled by the order @xmath183 and @xmath184 of the @xmath7 splines .",
    "a higher order leads to a broader band structure , but it offers also a higher flexibility of the basis functions , since it corresponds to a polynomial of higher order . thus less @xmath7 splines are needed for a comparable result , if a higher order is adopted . usually , the orders of @xmath183 ( @xmath184 ) of 8 or 9 turn out to be the best compromise with respect to basis - set size and sparseness , but also with respect to numerical stability in view of the finite precision in which floating - point numbers are stored in the computer .",
    "the two other parameters defining the radial @xmath7-spline basis are the number of @xmath7 splines and their knot sequence .",
    "clearly , the computational efforts ( number of integrals that have to be calculated and size of the matrices that have to be diagonalized ) depend crucially on the number of @xmath7 splines .",
    "since more @xmath7 splines are required for describing highly oscillatory wavefunctions , it is most efficient to use non - uniform knot sequences in which the @xmath7-spline density is higher in the highly oscillatory regions of ( radial ) space .    in the context of ultracold collisions the energetically low - lying c.m .",
    "orbitals @xmath276 are the ones that usually are of main interest . since they possess only a small number of nodes ( none in the lowest state ) , the demands on the @xmath7-spline basis are not too high . for the simplest case of a single - well lattice potential @xmath277 to @xmath278 @xmath7 splines ( or even less ) were found to be sufficient to obtain convergence for the ground and lowest - lying excited states of the c.m .",
    "motion  @xcite .",
    "also the lowest - lying states in a more structured trap potential like the triple - well potential considered in @xcite were satisfactorily treated with 70 @xmath7 splines .",
    "a linear knot sequence is usually adequate in this case .    the description of the rel .",
    "orbitals @xmath279 is more demanding , since one is usually not interested in the lowest - lying , deeply bound molecular states , but in the most weakly bound states or the low - lying dissociative ones .",
    "the born - oppenheimer potentials of alkali - metal atom dimers support often a large number of bound states  @xcite .",
    "the very long - ranged , weakly bound states consist , therefore , of a highly oscillatory inner part ( covering the molecular regime and providing the orthogonality to all lower lying bound states ) and a rather smooth long - range part . hence , it is advantageous to distribute a majority of @xmath7 splines in the molecular range of the potential while they are a sparser distributed in the outer part .",
    "the distribution of the b splines is given by the knot sequence @xmath280 , @xmath281 specifying a continuous chain of segments on which the @xmath7-spline functions are defined .",
    "the choice of a combined linear and geometrical knot sequence  @xcite for describing the short and long - range parts , respectively , has proven to be very efficient also in the present context  @xcite .",
    "the linear distribution of the knot sequence is given by @xmath282 where @xmath283 and @xmath284 are the number of @xmath7 splines in the linear interval and the origin of the linear interval , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath285 is the linear step size , i.e. , the distance between neighboring knots given as @xmath286 owing to the steep inner - wall of the molecular potential the wave function @xmath287 vanishes well before @xmath288 .",
    "therefore , @xmath284 is usually taken non - zero in order to save on the number of @xmath7 splines .",
    "the exact value of @xmath284 depends on the potential of the considered electronic state .",
    "note , @xmath289 points must be placed at both ends of the box in accordance with the definition of @xmath7 splines on the knot sequence ( e.g. , @xmath290 ) .",
    "the linear step @xmath285 is taken as the scale factor for the geometric progression to ensure the smooth distribution of @xmath7 splines at the border of the linear and geometric zones . in the geometrical knot sequence",
    "the separation of the knot points increases ( according to a geometric series ) with increasing distance .",
    "it is given by @xmath291 where @xmath292 is the number of @xmath7 splines in the geometric interval and @xmath293 is the common ratio for the geometric progression defined as @xmath294    the last parameter is the maximum value of angular momentum @xmath295 used and thus the number of angular basis functions .",
    "clearly , a more spherical - like lattice potential needs less angular momenta for representing the orbitals .",
    "the worst case is a highly anisotropic lattice geometry , since the spherical - harmonic basis converges extremely slowly in such a case . while a small value of @xmath295 of 1 or 2 was sufficient to obtain converged orbitals for an isotropic ( cubic ) single - well potential in @xcite in which among others also the experiment in @xcite",
    "was successfully modeled and thus realistic parameters were adopted . on the other hand ,",
    "the much more anisotropic triple - well potential considered in @xcite required @xmath296 for converged orbitals .      since a highly anisotropic lattice geometry provides a great challenge to our approach , it is important to demonstrate that even such a problem can be handled satisfactorily .",
    "another motivation is the present interest in ultracold atomic systems of reduced dimensionality . using strong confinement along one or two orthogonal directions , quasi one- or two - dimensional structures",
    "can nowadays be produced in the lab .",
    "such systems show remarkable quantum properties not encountered in three dimensions .",
    "a major experimental breakthrough was the realization of tonk - girardeau gases of bosons with strongly repulsive interaction  @xcite .",
    "being placed in 1d and repelling each other bosons are hindered from occupying the same position in space .",
    "this mimics the pauli exclusion principle for fermions , causing the bosonic particles to exhibit fermionic properties .",
    "another peculiar property of reduced dimensionality systems is the occurrence of confinement - induced resonances that were recently experimentally observed  @xcite .",
    "confinement - induced 1d feshbach resonances reachable by tuning the 1d coupling constant via 3d feshbach scattering resonances occur for both bose gases  @xcite and spin - aligned fermi gases  @xcite . near a confinement - induced resonances ,",
    "the effective 1d interaction is very strong , leading to strong short - range correlations , breakdown of effective field theories , and emergence of a highly correlated ground state .",
    "although confinement - induced resonances were originally predicted to occur already when only the rel .  motion is considered  @xcite , it was recently shown and furthermore verified using the here presented numerical approach that the ones observed in @xcite are in fact caused by the coupling of the c.m .  and rel .",
    "degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "a typical system to study effects of low dimensionality is two atoms confined in a quasi 1d cigar - shaped harmonic trap .",
    "we adopt this two - body setup to probe the quality of the present computational method in an extreme case of the strong anisotropic confinement .",
    "as was already mentioned , if the interparticle interaction between atoms is modeled by the @xmath34-function pseudopotential the problem can be solved analytically .",
    "therefore , the numerical results can be compared with the predictions of the pseudopotential model .",
    "one - dimensional external confinement is prepared by setting a strong harmonic frequency in either of two spatial directions , e.g. , @xmath297 where @xmath298 stands for the harmonic oscillator frequency along the spatial direction @xmath299 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the analytical solution is only known for this special case of the single anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "this emphasizes the need for numerical approaches to calculate spectra in totally anisotropic confinement where @xmath300 .",
    "the hamiltonian of two identical particles in our harmonic trap separates in rel .  and c.m",
    ".  motion .",
    "the c.m .",
    "spectrum reduces to the one of a simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "this simplifies the problem to calculate the rel .",
    "spectrum . hence , it is sufficient to solve numerically eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrel ] ) only . in the following two bosonic @xmath301li atoms",
    "are considered that are placed in the prolate trap with @xmath302 and interacting via the potential of the @xmath303 electronic triplet state .",
    "this electronic state has the advantage of supporting a small number of bound states .",
    "therefore , a smaller number of @xmath7 splines is required to reproduce the @xmath304 functions .",
    "the numerical data for the born - oppenheimer potential curve are adopted from  @xcite . in order to achieve converged results for the first few states @xmath305 , a box size of approximately @xmath306 , where @xmath307 is the bohr radius , and @xmath308 @xmath7 splines of the order @xmath309 were used .",
    "half of the @xmath7 splines ( @xmath310 ) are distributed linearly according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : lin_ks ] ) over the small interatomic distance of @xmath311 to reproduce the highly oscillatory structure of @xmath287 in this region .",
    "furthermore , for our calculations we can safely choose @xmath312 .",
    "the remaining @xmath7 splines ( @xmath313 ) are distributed in an ascending geometric progression according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : geo_ks ] ) over the residual interval .",
    "finally , different values of the interaction strength are obtained using a single - channel approach by a smooth variation of the inner wall of the molecular interaction potential  @xcite .",

    "hamiltonian together with the analytical prediction of the pseudopotential approximation .",
    "the spectral curves are plotted as functions of @xmath314 , where @xmath315 is the harmonic oscillator length in transversal direction .    .",
    "the numerical calculation ( blue dots ) is compared to the analytical prediction of the pseudopotential approximation ( red lines).,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_solo ] , the first four trap states and the bound state match perfectly with the analytical prediction of the pseudopotential model . however , high lying states show deviations .    in order to explain the increasing mismatch found for higher lying states and to give an impression of the convergence behavior of the present approach , energy spectra for different values of the angular momentum",
    "are calculated . for the calculations @xmath316",
    "is chosen .",
    "close to this value a confinement - induced resonance should occur  @xcite motivating this choice .",
    "the results of the calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_convergence ] .",
    "as is seen from this figure , at @xmath305 the slopes of the energy curves are approximately zero , especially for the first four trap states .",
    "this indicates that convergence is achieved with respect to @xmath295 .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum_convergence ] clearly demonstrates that the high lying states require larger values of the angular momentum for convergence .",
    "this can now as well be concluded from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_solo ] .     in the strongly repulsive regime for @xmath316 .",
    "the deeper lying bound state is not shown here , because it is already converged for @xmath317 .",
    "( to guide the eye , the discrete points of the numerical calculation are connected by continuous lines . )",
    "[ fig : spectrum_convergence],scaledwidth=46.0% ]    while convergence can be extended to higher energies or higher anisotropies by increasing @xmath295 , the computational efforts increase adding new angular momenta .",
    "however , as the precision is only limited by hardware capacities , this example demonstrates the applicability of the approach even for extreme setups .",
    "the demands of the exact diagonalization also known as configuration interaction ( ci ) depend evidently again on the physical system under consideration .",
    "while the atom - atom interaction is very efficiently handled even for strongly interacting atoms and basically contained in the rel .",
    "orbitals , the ci takes care of the c.m .  and rel",
    ".  coupling .",
    "thus its convergence depends on the strength of this coupling .",
    "correspondingly , convergence is much faster for weakly coupled systems . if all configurations that can be built with the c.m .  and rel .",
    "orbitals are included , full ci is achieved . while being well defined , full ci scales very inconveniently with the number of orbitals .",
    "therefore , it is in practice in most cases more advantageous to include only a limited number of the possible configurations .",
    "for example , the inclusion of the orbitals of very high energy does usually not lead to a noticeable improvement of the low lying states .",
    "therefore , an energy cut - off may be introduced in the orbital selection .",
    "if the interest is mainly on those states that are weakly bound or dissociative , but close to the dissociation threshold , the deeply bound molecular states can be omitted from the ci configurations  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that a good representation of those states in the calculation of the rel .",
    "orbitals is nevertheless important , since otherwise the rel .",
    "orbitals of the weakly bound states are not well described and this can in practice not be compensated by the ci calculation . in the worst case the calculation of the rel .",
    "orbitals provides too few bound states and then the nodal structure of the weakly bound states is evidently wrong .",
    "although the coupled hamiltonian matrices are usually much larger than the uncoupled ones and are therefore harder to diagonalize , there are two points easing the treatment of the coupled ones .",
    "first , the eigenvalue problem to be solved in the ci step is a standard one ( meaning that the the basis is orthonormal ) , while generalized ones occur in the orbital calculations .",
    "second , in many cases only a relatively small number of ci states is required .",
    "therefore , it is possible to use lanzcos or davidson type diagonalization routines that ( iteratively ) provide a small number of eigenstates within a specific energy interval .",
    "here we adopted the davidson - based diagonalization routine jadamilu  @xcite that is especially designed for the efficient diagonalization of large sparse matrices .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the choice of expressing all wavefunctions in rel .  and c.m .",
    "coordinates is advantageous for computational reasons , but often not very helpful in the interpretation of the results . especially in the case of multi - well potentials the obtained wavefunctions and densities are often very complicated .",
    "therefore , a further code was implemented that allows the application of the inverse coordinate transform from c.m .- rel .",
    "coordinates to the absolute ones according to @xmath318 and @xmath319 to the wavefunctions , especially to @xmath320 which allowed a much easier physical interpretation , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "an approach that allows the full numerical description of two ultracold atoms in a finite orthorhombic 3d optical lattice is presented .",
    "the coupling between center - of - mass and relative motion coordinates is incorporated in a configuration - interaction manner and hence the full 6d problem is solved .",
    "an important feature is the use of realistic interatomic interaction potentials adopting , e.g. , numerically provided born - oppenheimer curves .",
    "the use of spherical harmonics together with @xmath7 splines as basis functions and the expansion of the trap in terms of spherical harmonics leads to an analytical form of the matrix elements , except those of the interparticle interaction , if the interaction potential is defined only numerically .",
    "the sparseness of the hamiltonian matrices due to the use of the compact radial @xmath7-spline basis is considered explicitly .",
    "this makes the method computationally efficient .",
    "additionally , the lattice symmetry and a possible indistinguishability of the atoms ( bosonic or fermionic statistics ) is considered explicitly .",
    "this simplifies the calculations and helps to interpret the solutions .",
    "the here presented approach has already proven its applicability by considering the influence of the anharmonicity in a single site of an optical lattice in @xcite where a corresponding experiment @xcite could be reproduced and analyzed .",
    "the validity range of the bose - hubbard model together with an improved determination of the bose - hubbard parameters was investigated considering a triple - well potential in @xcite .",
    "the implemented approach was formulated in a rather general way in order to allow extensions in various directions . since the optical - lattice potential is ( via the taylor expansion ) expressed as a superposition of polynomials , it is rather straightforward to consider other than pure @xmath5 or @xmath6 potentials , as long as they can be represented with ( a reasonable number of ) polynomials .",
    "this includes tilted lattices and superlattices .",
    "care has , however , to be taken that the orthorhombic symmetry is either preserved , or new symmetry rules have to be implemented .",
    "substitution of the numerical interatomic potential by , e.g. , the coulomb potential allows to describe either two electrons or an exciton in quantum - dot atoms or molecules .",
    "it is furthermore planned to implement non - isotropic interatomic potentials like dipole - dipole interactions as they are of interest for cr or rydberg atoms and for heteronuclear diatomic molecules .",
    "finally , an extension of the approach in the direction of time - dependent problems ( with time dependent lattice or interatomic interaction potentials ) is currently under way .",
