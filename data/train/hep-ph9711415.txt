    "it is one of the most important problems in particle physics whether neutrinos have mass or not . from recent neutrino experiments",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , it becomes very probable that neutrinos have mass .",
    "however , if neutrinos have mass , we must explain the reason why it would be so small relative to charged lepton masses .",
    "the seesaw mechanism is one of the most promising candidates for such an explanation . in this case ,",
    "neutrinos become majorana particles , and three cp violating phases remain in the lepton mixing matrix u for the three generation case @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with the case of dirac neutrinos , in which only one cp - violating phase remains in u. thus , for majorana neutrinos , possible cp violations due to these phases in u complicates obtaining information about the lepton mixing angles from the corresponding experiments .",
    "in this paper we consider neutrinos as massive majorana particles with three generations and shaw how experiments , such as neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath3 ) and neutrino oscillation , constrain lepton mixing angles and neutrino mass . in order to obtain these constraints we take possible cp - violating phases in u into account . in @xmath3",
    "there are three cp - violating phases which contribute to possible cp violations . in the neutrino oscillation ,",
    "on the other hand , there is only one such phase as in the case of dirac neutrinos .    in sec.ii",
    "we obtain constraints from @xmath3 .",
    "the constraint which arises from the neutrino oscillation experiment chorus is described in sec.iii . combining these constraints , we find that the large mixing angle of @xmath0 becomes improbable if the third generation of neutrino is a candidate for hot dark matter and not degenerate .",
    "let us first consider the neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath4 ) which occurs only in the case of majorana neutrinos .",
    " fig.1     the decay rate of @xmath4 is , in the absence of right - handed couplings , proportional to the `` averaged '' mass defined by @xcite @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the left - handed neutrino mixing matrix which combines the weak eigenstate ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) to the mass eigenstate with mass @xmath9 ( j=1,2 and 3 ) .",
    "@xmath6 takes the following form in the case of majorana neutrinos , @xmath10 here @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) . besides @xmath14",
    "there appear two additional cp violating phases @xmath15 and @xmath16 for majorana neutrinos .",
    "hence @xmath17 becomes @xmath18 where we have introduced @xmath19 the cp violating phases @xmath20 and @xmath21 complicate extracting the constraints on the mixing angles from @xmath17 . in the following discussion , we follow the method given in @xcite in order to get the constraints which are independent on @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    from eq.([eq3 ] ) it follows that @xmath22 rewriting @xmath23 and @xmath24 as @xmath25 , we can consider eq.([eq5 ] ) as an equation of @xmath25 : @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are defined by @xmath29 so , the discriminant @xmath30 for eq.([eq6 ] ) must satisfy the following inequality : @xmath31 where @xmath32 so we obtain @xmath33 it follows from eq.([eq10 ] ) that @xmath34 analogously , rewriting @xmath35 and @xmath36 as @xmath37 , and considering eq.([eq5 ] ) as an equation of @xmath38 , we obtain the inequalities : @xmath39 here @xmath40 so we get @xmath41 conditions ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) are consistency conditions .",
    "the cp violation area is given by more stringent conditions @xmath42 using the inequalities ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) , we can describe the allowed region for mixing angles in the @xmath43 versus @xmath44 plane once the neutrino masses @xmath45 and the `` averaged '' neutrino mass @xmath46 are known .",
    "only an upper bound of o(1ev ) for the magnitude of @xmath47 has been determined experimentally @xcite .",
    "the neutrino masses may be safely ordered as @xmath48 .",
    "so in the following discussions we will consider three cases :    \\a ) @xmath49 ,    \\b ) @xmath50 ,    and    \\c ) @xmath51 .    note that the definition of @xmath46 in eq.([eq1 ] ) and the schwartz inequality jointly imply that latexmath:[\\[\\langle m_\\nu \\rangle \\leq \\sum _ { j=1}^{3 } m_j|u_{ej}^2|\\leq m_3\\sum _ { j=1}^{3 }     @xmath47 can not be larger than @xmath1 .",
    "the allowed regions in the @xmath43 versus @xmath44 plane for cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are obtained from eqs.([eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) , and are shown in fig.2 .     fig.2     from fig.2 , we obtain the following upper bound on @xmath44 : @xmath53 in each of these cases . the cp violation areas in the @xmath43 versus @xmath44 plane given by eq.([eq15 ] ) are indicated by oblique lines in fig.2",
    ". case ( a ) has been considered also in @xcite and@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the representation for the mixing matrix adopted by cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa was used . in @xcite , only the limiting case where all the neutrino masses are degenerate ( @xmath54 ) was discussed .",
    "it should be noted that we consider the additional cases ( b ) and ( c ) and also that no conditions on the neutrino masses have been imposed so far .",
    "fig.2 describes the allowed regions for neutrinoless double beta decay in the most general case . in the following discussion",
    "we restrict cases ( b ) and ( c ) as follows : ( b@xmath55 ) @xmath56 and ( c@xmath55 ) @xmath57 .",
    "we will see how the neutrinoless double beta decay constrains the mixing angles @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    in case ( b@xmath55 )",
    "we obtain @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "so the allowed regions depend solely on the value of @xmath63 . in fig.3",
    ", we depict the allowed region @xmath43 versus @xmath44 plane for @xmath64 0.16 , 0.33 , 0.49 , 0.65 , 0.82  and  0.98 .     fig.3     in case ( c@xmath55 ) we have @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , the allowed region is @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "it is interesting that the value of @xmath44 is completely determined by @xmath63 in this case .",
    "in this section , we consider the constraints obtained from the neutrino oscillation experiment chorus@xcite and see how the method developed in the previous section can also be used to describe the allowed region in @xmath43 versus @xmath44 plane .",
    "the chorus experiment investigates @xmath68 oscillation through the observation of the @xmath8 leptons . the @xmath69 c.l .",
    "upper limit of the probability of @xmath70 is @xmath71 @xcite . in order to obtain the constraints from this experiment we consider two cases :    ( i ) : :    @xmath72 ( ii ) : :    @xmath73    firstly we consider case ( i ) . in this case",
    "we have @xmath74 . substituting the experimental setting , @xmath75gev and @xmath76",
    ", we have @xmath77 hence we may set @xmath78 .",
    "so the approximate oscillation probability is given by @xcite @xmath79 substituting the expression of eq.([eq2 ] ) into eq.([eq18 ] ) , we obtain the following equation w.r.t @xmath80 , @xmath81 here @xmath82 the oscillation process does not distinguish majorana neutrino from dirac neutrino and only the @xmath14 phase occurs",
    ".    the constraints are obtained from eq.([eq19 ] ) .",
    "@xmath83 is negative definite and @xmath84 is positive definite .",
    "therefore the condition @xmath85 implies the following inequalities :    case a-1 : : :    @xmath86 @xmath87 case a-2 : : :    @xmath88 @xmath89 case b-1 : : :    @xmath90 @xmath91 case b-2 : : :    @xmath92 @xmath93    as we have mentioned before , only an upper bound of @xmath94 has been deteermined experimentally .",
    "so the meaningful inequalities arise from the lower bounds of eqs.([eq21 ] ) @xmath95 ( [ eq24 ] ) .",
    "namely +    * case a * @xmath96    * case b * @xmath97 from these inequalities ( [ eq25 ] ) and ( [ eq26 ] ) , we obtain the allowed region in the @xmath43 versus @xmath44 plane for a fixed value of @xmath58 . using @xmath98 and @xmath99 , we show the allowed regions for @xmath100 in fig.4 .     fig.4     next we consider case ( ii ) . here",
    "@xmath101 , and we have @xmath102 here , analogously to case ( i ) , @xmath103 has been assumed . substituting the expression of eq.([eq2 ] ) into eq.([eq27 ] ) , we obtain @xmath104 combining eq.([eq28 ] ) with the constraints from the neutrinoless double beta decay eq.([eq17 ] ) , we also obtain @xmath105 using the experimental upper bound of @xmath106 and eq.([eq28 ] ) , we obtain the allowed regions in the @xmath107 versus @xmath44 plane for the possible values of @xmath1 ( fig.5 ) .",
    " fig.5     eq.([eq29 ] ) with @xmath108 gives more interesting constraints in the @xmath107 versus @xmath47 plane for the possible values of @xmath1 , which is depicted in fig.6 .",
    " fig.6     it should be noted that @xmath47 can not be larger than @xmath1 as seen from eq.([eq16 ] ) .",
    "if we input the experimental upper bound of @xmath109 in fig.6 , we obtain more stringent constraints on @xmath58 .",
    "it is interesting that the allowed region becomes more restrictive as the experimental results become more precise .",
    "that is , the smaller the upper bounds of @xmath70 and @xmath47 become , the more restricted the allowed region is .",
    "especially , the large mixing angle solution of @xmath58 becomes improbable if @xmath1 is a candidate for hot dark matter .",
    "we have obtained constraints from @xmath110 and the chorus neutrino oscillation experiment , taking into account possible cp violation phases . from @xmath110 ,",
    "the allowed regions on @xmath107 versus @xmath44 plane are obtained for the respective cases ( case(a ) : @xmath111 , case(b ) : @xmath112 , and case(c ) : @xmath113 ) . from the chorus neutrino oscillation experiment ,",
    "we have obtained the allowed regions in the @xmath43 versus @xmath44 plane for given values of @xmath58 for case ( i ) ; @xmath114 . for case(ii ) , @xmath101 , we have obtained the allowed regions in the @xmath107 versus @xmath44 plane and those in the @xmath47 versus @xmath107 plane for given values of @xmath1 . combining the constraint from the chorus neutrino oscillation experiment with those obtained from @xmath115",
    ", we have found that the large mixing angle solution of @xmath58 becomes improbable if the neutrino mass @xmath1 of the third generation is a candidate for hot dark matter and not degenerate .",
    "recently the super kamiokande group announced that they obtained the large angle solution @xmath116 with @xmath117ev@xmath118 from the atmospheric neutrino deficit @xcite .",
    "this conclusion does not contradict our result since their @xmath119 is of order less than 1ev@xmath118 .",
