    "investigations of hard exclusive processes are essential for our understanding of the internal quark - gluon dynamics of hadrons .",
    "theoretically , such studies are based on the assumption of factorization of dynamics at long and short distances .",
    "the short - distance physics is well elaborated by perturbative methods of qcd and depends on particular hard subprocesses .",
    "the long - distance dynamics is essentially nonperturbative and within the factorization formalism becomes parametrized in terms of hadronic _ distribution amplitudes _",
    "( das ) or their transverse - momentum unintegrated generalizations , the _ light - cone wave functions _ ( lcwf ) .",
    "these nonperturbative quantities are universal and are defined as vacuum - to - hadron matrix elements of particular nonlocal light - cone quark or quark - gluon operators .",
    "the evolution of das at sufficiently large virtuality @xmath4 is controlled by the renormalization scale dependence of the quark bilinear operators within the qcd perturbation theory . for leading - order das",
    "this dependence is governed by simple qcd evolution equations of the efremov - radyushkin - brodsky - lepage ( er - bl ) type @xcite .",
    "when the normalization scale goes to infinity the das reach an ultraviolet fixed point and are uniquely determined by perturbative qcd .",
    "however , the derivation of the das themselves at an initial scale @xmath5 from first principles is a nonperturbative problem and remains a serious challenge .",
    "moreover , at experimentally achievable energies it is likely that the normalization scale is low and the nonperturbative effects are essential .",
    "it is expected that at such low scales the shape of das can differ essentially from their asymptotic forms and at present can not be strictly predicted from first principles .",
    "nevertheless , there are several well - established methods to get information on genuinely nonperturbative quantities such as hadronic distribution amplitudes at low normalization scale : the qcd sum rules method @xcite , the relativistic quark models @xcite , the instanton liquid model @xcite , the effective chiral quark models @xcite , or transverse lattice qcd @xcite",
    ". first and second moments of pion das have also been evaluated on euclidean lattices @xcite .",
    "a special class of processes involves either virtual or real photons which provide ideal tools for probing the hadronic structure in deep - inelastic and hard exclusive scattering experiments .",
    "the reason is that the photon is not an eigenstate of qcd but a superposition of the @xmath6 gauge boson and quark - gluon configurations which are suppressed by the electromagnetic coupling .",
    "while a photon is normally considered a structureless particle , it can fluctuate into a charged lepton- and quark - pair states , which can be revealed through interactions with a highly virtual photon .",
    "thus , the photon das have both electromagnetic and hadronic components .",
    "the electromagnetic component can be calculated within qed , while the hadronic part must be analyzed with non - perturbative methods of strong interactions .    despite the wealth of theoretical studies",
    "not much experimental information is available to constrain various theoretical predictions ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "the hadronic das and lcwfs can be measured from hard exclusive processes at some high momentum scale .",
    "for example the pion and photon das may be extracted from hard dijet production by incident pions @xcite and real photons @xcite , correspondingly .",
    "the measurements of the photon da and lcwf are based on the method of diffractive dissociation applied already to the study of the pion distributions .",
    "a differential measurement of the pion da and lcwf was performed by the fermilab e791 collaboration by studying the diffractive dissociation of high momentum pions into two jets @xcite .",
    "the recent measurements at hera provided the first evidence that diffractive dissociation of particles can be reliably used to measure the photon das .",
    "hence , the electromagnetic component of the photon lcwf may be extracted from the study of the exclusive @xmath7 photoproduction process @xcite and the hadronic component from the exclusive processes of diffractive photo- or electro - production of two pions @xcite .",
    "this may be considered as a special case of the photon dissociation to dijets when each jet consists of one pion .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study the photon das and lcwfs of leading and higher twists at a low - momentum renormalization scale in a variety of chiral quark models : the gauged non - local chiral quark model based on the instanton picture of qcd vacuum @xcite , the spectral quark model @xcite , and the nambu  jona - lasinio model with the pauli - villars regulator .",
    "there are a number of advantages of the chiral model approach in comparison with other existing approaches . besides the incorporation of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking calculations can directly be carried out in the minkowski space",
    ". actually , the corresponding calculations are manifestly covariant , so the subtleties of the light - cone quantization do not arise . within non - local models",
    "an effective resummation of quark - gluon condensates of growing dimension is performed .",
    "although our results are obviously model dependent , we have theoretical control on several properties that should be satisfied _ a priori _ , with the symmetry requirements being the most stringent restriction .",
    "the resulting ward - takahashi identities are properly incorporated and their role in quark models is very important when computing the light - cone properties .",
    "we stress that in our approach we depart from standard parameterizations and do undertake a _ genuine dynamical calculation_. analogous results for the pion have been obtained earlier in the instanton model @xcite , in the nambu  jona - lasinio model @xcite , in the spectral quark model @xcite , and most recently in the large-@xmath8 regge model @xcite .",

    "in the present work we have carried out an analysis of the hadronic part of the photon das of leading and higher twists up to fourth order at low normalization scale within several effective chiral quark models . we have studied the das of real and virtual photons for both transverse and longitudinal polarizations .",
    "our analysis has been performed within two classes of models : the nonlocal model , based on the instanton picture of the qcd vacuum , and local models ( the spectral quark model and the nambu  jona - lasinio model ) . despite the different nature and details of the calculations ,",
    "our analysis has shown a remarkable similarity of the results in both classes of models . by working with the photon vertex satisfying the ward - takahashi identity",
    "we have revised and improved the results for the leading - twist photon da first performed in @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the calculations based on the nonlocal model with a correct implementation of gauge invariance resulted in much flatter results , with the photon da remaining non - zero at the end - points @xmath257 , in qualitative agreement with local quark model calculations .",
    "the main findings may be summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the leading - twist das of the real photon at low momenta scale are constant in the local models and almost constant for the nonlocal model .",
    "the independence of the photon das on @xmath0 is expected for the local models .",
    "they also predict a constant behaviour for the leading - twist pion da @xcite . at the same time the nonlocal model predicts nontrivial @xmath0 dependence in the case of the pion @xcite , and",
    "shows a constant behaviour for the photon independently on the shape of the nonlocal form factor .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the photon has no hadronic form factor in contrary to hadrons which are a genuine bound state of dynamical quarks .",
    "\\(2 ) furthermore we show that applying the qcd evolution to leading order of the perturbation theory , the leading - twist photon das become immediately zero at the edge points of the @xmath0 interval ( as in the pion case of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and are always wider ( flatter ) than the asymptotic da . at the same time",
    "the evolution of the moments of das is evidently continous .",
    "this is a typical situation for functional series which are non - uniformly convergent .",
    "the role of the qcd evolution is very important , as the quark - model results are far from the asymptotic form .",
    "the quark model scale estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite for the local models is very low , about @xmath258  mev , therefore the evolution is very fast . for the instanton model",
    "it is estimated as @xmath259 mev @xcite . in short ,",
    "our predictions may be compared to data only after a suitable qcd evolution has been carried out .",
    "further , for more realistic predictions the perturbative evolution with a kernel calculated at the two - loop level is certainly desirable .",
    "\\(3 ) some of the higher - twist photon das have delta - function behaviour at the edge points of the @xmath0 interval .",
    "it might be interpreted as originating from differentiating the constant leading twist das and corresponds to the quark - anti - quark configurations of the photon da when all momentum is carried by one quark ( or anti - quark ) .",
    "this singular initial behaviour is washed out during perturbative qcd  evolution to higher momentum scales .",
    "we also predict the behaviour of the leading- and higher - twist das for nonzero virtuality of the photon .",
    "\\(4 ) we have drawn our attention to the fact that the equations of motion of perturbative qcd and of the effective approaches are different . in the latter case",
    "spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is taken into account in terms of a momentum dependent dynamical quark mass .",
    "so our results do not coincide with those obtained in perturbative qcd  using the equations of motion .",
    "in particular , the relations between normalization constants , and das for different twist ( the wandzura - wilczek relations ) are not satisfied in the effective approach .",
    "we question the validity of such a method , since it implicitly assumes that current quarks are on the mass shell and free , while our interest is in low energy matrix elements .",
    "we show that the norm of the tensor amplitude is related to the magnetic susceptibility of the quark condensate , and the zero norm in the vector channel is constrained by the vector - current conservation , while the axial - vector norm remains unconstrained .",
    "the latter is determined by nonperturbative dynamics , and therefore its value is model - dependent .",
    "\\(5 ) finally we compare our results with those obtained from the conformal twist expansion @xcite using qcd sum rules and vector - meson - dominance methods .",
    "it seems that the results obtained in the leading and next - to - leading orders of the conformal expansion do not converge .",

    "<S> the leading- and higher - twist distribution amplitudes and light - cone wave functions of real and virtual photons are analyzed in chiral quark models . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are performed in the nonlocal quark model based on the instanton picture of qcd vacuum , as well as in the spectral quark model and the nambu  jona - lasinio model with the pauli - villars regulator , which both treat interaction of quarks with external fields locally . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in all considered models the leading - twist distribution amplitudes of the real photon defined at the quark - model momentum scale are constant or remarkably close to the constant in the @xmath0 variable , thus are far from the asymptotic limit form . </S>",
    "<S> the qcd evolution to higher momentum scales is necessary and we carry it out at the leading order of the perturbative theory for the leading - twist amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we provide estimates for the magnetic susceptibility of the quark condensate @xmath1 and the coupling @xmath2 , which in the nonlocal model turn out to be close to the estimates from qcd sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> we find the higher - twist distribution amplitudes at the quark model scale and compare them to the wandzura - wilczek estimates . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in the spectral model we evaluate the distribution amplitudes and light - cone wave functions of the @xmath3-meson . </S>"
