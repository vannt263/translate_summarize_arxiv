    "the power - law exponent is fixed to @xmath16 and the exponential cut - off radius is set to 1.9 kpc . in most cases , we model the disk component as a miyamoto - nagai potential with three free parameters : the scale length @xmath17 , the scale height @xmath18 , and an amplitude parameter .",

    "the kinematics of disk stars within a few kpc from the sun strongly constraints @xmath26 to be close to one for any angle between @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite .    other constraints on @xmath26 come from tidal streams .",
    "a successful model of the tidal tails of the sgr dwarf galaxy has been found with @xmath30 @xcite , but if this axis ratio is assumed in the inner @xmath31 , no model compatible with the observed pal 5 tidal stream can be found @xcite .",
    "we can use the sensitivity to @xmath26 and @xmath6 of orbits compatible with the pal 5 and gd1 data described below as a proxy for how sensitive these data on the average location of the track are to these parameters . for both streams",
    "we find that such orbits are hardly sensitive to even large variations in @xmath26 ( @xmath26 going from 1/2 to 2 ) , whether or not @xmath32 and @xmath22 are aligned or not .",
    "the sensitivity to the maximally misaligned setup is for both streams larger than that of the aligned setup , but all changes in @xmath26 lead to orbits that differ by an order of magnitude less than orbits for different @xmath6 .",
    "this is the case because the streams are located near a galactocentric azimuth of zero ( gd1 ) and @xmath33 ( pal 5 ) .",
    "the lack of sensitivity to changes in @xmath26 only apply to the stream _",
    "track_. like @xcite , we find that if the halo is triaxial with @xmath27 a narrow stream does not form at the phase  space location of pal 5 because of chaos .",
    "this fact could be used to set a limit on @xmath34 from the observed width of pal 5 , but we do not pursue this in this paper .    because observational data indicate that @xmath35 and because both the pal 5 and gd1 stream tracks are largely insensitive to changes in @xmath26 , we fix @xmath26 to one in what follows .      to determine what , if any , constraints on the halo axis ratio @xmath6 we can set based on existing dynamical data and to find a realistic set of potentials to use in the analysis of the pal 5 and gd1 streams below , we perform fits of the above potential model to a variety of dynamical data on the bulge , disk , and halo . this fit is similar to that used to arrive at the fiducial ` mwpotential2014 ` model of @xcite and we summarize the data , fit procedure , and differences with ` mwpotential2014 ` here .",

    "the vertical force @xmath37 at the solar circle at @xmath38 and the local visible surface density @xmath39 from @xcite ; 3 .   the vertical force measurements at @xmath38 of @xcite ; 4 .",

    "the measurement of the total mass within @xmath41 from @xcite : @xmath42 .    unlike @xcite",
    ", we allow the sun s distance to the galactic center @xmath43 and the circular velocity @xmath44 at @xmath43 to vary .",
    "based on recent measurements of @xmath43 @xcite , we use the constraint @xmath45 .",
    "we also use the constraint @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "we will see that all determinations of @xmath6 in this paper are uncorrelated with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , so these constraints are not crucial .",
    "the free parameters of the potential model are the amplitude , scale length , and scale height of the disk component , the amplitude , scale radius , and axis ratio @xmath6 of the halo component , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "the amplitudes of the disk , halo , and bulge components are specified in terms of the fraction of the radial force at @xmath47 that they provide ( with @xmath48 for the disk fraction and @xmath49 for the halo fraction ) .",
    "the results from fitting the data above are summarized in figure  [ fig : mwpot14_prior ] .",
    "this figure displays the posterior probability distribution function ( pdf ) when modeling the disk using a miyamoto - nagai density , focusing on the correlation between @xmath6 and the other model parameters .",
    "the pdfs are similar when using a double - exponential disk , except that the scale length of the disk is @xmath50 ( and @xmath51 when also including a gas component as discussed below , in agreement with @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : mwpot14_prior ] that there is only a weak constraint on @xmath6 from these data and that @xmath6 is largely uncorrelated with all of the other model parameters .",
    "however , the data disfavor strongly flattened halo densities , with only @xmath52 probability that @xmath53 in the case of a miyamoto - nagai disk and that @xmath54 for a double - exponential disk ( both of these @xmath6 limits are about 0.2 smaller for @xmath55 probability ) .",
    "note that these models do not include a more extended gas component .",
    "including such a component to the double - exponential disk model with a scale length that is twice that of the stellar component , a scale height of @xmath56 , and a local surface density of @xmath57 , the @xmath52 lower limit is 0.65 .",
    "the lower cut - off in @xmath6 happens because the @xmath58 data from @xcite prefer a short scale length for the disk .",
    "the halo s effective scale length is @xmath59 , thus making it difficult to satisfy the @xmath58 measurements if too much of the halo s mass is concentrated near the mid - plane . above this",
    "lower cut - off on @xmath6 , the pdf for @xmath6 is almost flat up to @xmath60 , which is the highest @xmath6 that we consider .",
    "thus , the pre - stream dynamical data do not provide any constraint on @xmath6 beyond that it can not be much smaller than one .",
    "we re - do this fit in @xmath15  [ sec : combined ] adding in the new measurements of the force field from the next sections .",
    "the data on the pal 5 and gd1 stellar streams that we consider in the next two sections come in the form of measurements of the phase  space location of the track of these streams .",
    "that is , we have measurements of some combination of the sky position , distance from the sun , proper motion vector , and line - of - sight velocity measured as a function of a coordinate going along the stream . for the pal 5 stream we also have measurements of the six - dimensional position and velocity of its progenitor , the pal 5 globular cluster .",
    "we do not make use of measurements of the density along the stream .    to fit these data we follow the action ",
    "angle modeling approach of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the approach of @xcite consists of a simple analytic model for the frequency distribution of tidal debris at the time of stripping . in action ",
    "angle coordinates , this analytic model can be straightforwardly manipulated using the simple linear action  angle dynamics to derive the current frequency ",
    "angle structure along the stream for any given model .",
    "in particular , one can easily and analytically compute the track in frequency and angle space as a function of the location along the stream .",
    "@xcite also introduced a novel , general method for computing actions , frequencies , and angles in any static gravitational potential ( including triaxial potentials ) that can be used to convert this track in frequency ",
    "angle space to configuration space .",
    "the track can also be converted to configuration space in a more direct manner using the torus mapper code of @xcite , but we primarily use the method of @xcite , because it is more accurate , and only use the torus mapper in the rare instances where the @xcite method fails to converge . in configuration space ,",
    "the track can be compared to observed data .",
    "the fundamental ingredients of the model are ( a ) a prescription for the times at which stars are stripped from the progenitor , ( b ) a model for the distribution of frequency ( and angle ) offsets from the progenitor at the time of stripping , ( c ) the phase  space location of the progenitor , and ( d ) the gravitational potential of the host galaxy ( the milky way in this case ) . in the case of pal 5 , ingredient ( c ) is strongly constrained by the measurements of the position and velocity of the pal 5 cluster . for gd1 , for which the progenitor is unknown , the phase  space location of the progenitor needs to be fully constrained by the stream data .",
    "@xcite proposed a simple model for ingredients ( a ) and ( b ) , in which the stripping rate is constant up to a time @xmath61 in the past at which the disruption started and in which the frequency offset distribution is determined by a single velocity - dispersion parameter @xmath62 .",
    "@xcite argued and demonstrated for a single @xmath63-body simulation of the disruption of a gd1-like cluster that the stripping rate can be approximated as constant on timescales longer than the radial period ; on shorter timescales the stripping is dominated by pericentric bursts .",
    "we have performed similar additional simulations in the three - component milky - way - like potential ` mwpotential2014 ` and for clusters that are more concentrated than the loosely - bound cluster used by @xcite and find the same behavior in all cases .",
    "furthermore , we have computed the effect on the track of assuming a stripping rate that decreases ( stripping rate increasing as @xmath64 towards earlier times @xmath64 ) or increases ( @xmath65 ) in time . in all of these cases , the mean frequency offset between the stream and the progenitor changes by less than 5% or less than 1/3 of the dispersion around the mean frequency .",
    "thus , the track is largely insensitive to changes in the stripping rate and we assume that it is constant throughout the analysis .",
    "@xcite further demonstrated that the mean frequency along a stream is constant up to the edge of the stream , which can only be reached by stars stripped at exceptionally high frequency differences .",
    "it is straightforward to compute the density along the stream in the @xcite model in a similar manner as the calculation of the mean frequency along the stream and such calculations demonstrate that the edge of the stream has much lower density than the part closer to the progenitor .",
    "thus , the segment of the stream that is high enough in surface brightness to be detected observationally has an approximately constant frequency .",
    "therefore , we can model this part of the stream as a single orbital torus .",
    "note that this does _ not _ mean that we can model it as a single _ orbit _ , because the direction of the frequency offset is in general not aligned with the frequency direction of an orbit .",
    "this is especially the case in the three - component milky way models and the non - spherical halos that we consider here . because we do not know the extent of either the pal 5 or gd1 stellar streams because they are limited by the edge of the surveys in which they have been detected or by the galactic plane , constraining the time @xmath61 at which disruption started is difficult with the present data .",
    "we therefore fix @xmath61 to @xmath66 in both cases , making the stream old enough that for any potential that we consider a long stream forms .",
    "if better measurements of the width and length of streams were available , these could be used as additional constraints , because in very non - spherical halos it is difficult to produce a thin and long stream .",
    "however , for the halo shapes that we find to be consistent with the pal 5 and gd1 data below , this is not a major problem .",
    "when we model the stream as being a single orbital torus , we can further restrict the model .",
    "the parameter @xmath62 determines the location of the track , because it scales the frequency offset between the progenitor and the stream , and it sets the width and length of the stream ( in conjunction with @xmath61 ) .",
    "we do not attempt to match the observed width of the streams below and therefore @xmath62 only affects the location of the track .",
    "that said , the @xmath62 that produce a matching track below also give reasonable stream widths . for pal 5",
    "we fix the known sky position and line - of - sight velocity of the progenitor and we use the dispersion parameter @xmath62 as a way to match the stream ",
    "progenitor offset .",
    "for gd1 , for which we do not know the progenitor position , @xmath62 would be degenerate with the phase  space location of the progenitor and we therefore fix it to a reasonable value .",
    "similarly , one of the six phase  space coordinates of the gd1 progenitor is unconstrained by this modeling and we fix one of the sky location coordinates near one end of the gd1 stream . because we can approximate the stream track as having constant frequency , it also does not matter whether we model gd1 as being a leading or trailing arm .",
    "this choice excludes the possibility that gd1 s progenitor or dissolved progenitor sits in the middle of the observed part of the stream .",
    "this is unlikely because in this case a clear kink of @xmath67 would be visible at the @xmath68 position of the progenitor , which is not observed .",
    "the milky - way potential model of @xmath15  [ sec : mwmodel ] is characterized by 8 parameters and the stream model adds four ( in the case of pal 5 ) or five ( for gd1 ) additional parameters .",
    "to lower the dimensionality of each stream fit and thus speed it up , we restrict the range of potentials as follows .",
    "we perform the fit described in @xmath15  [ sec : priorfit ] fixing @xmath69 and @xmath70 and we obtain 32 independent samples from the posterior pdf for the remaining six parameters . for each of these 32 samples",
    "we then analyze the stream data separately , keeping the five potential parameters describing the relative amplitudes , the scale length and height of the disk , and the scale radius of the halo fixed at the value of the sample , but allowing @xmath6 and additionally @xmath44 to vary ( between 1/2 and 2 for @xmath6 and between @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath44 ) .",
    "these 32 sampled sets of fixed parameters are shown as crosses in figure  [ fig : mwpot14_prior ] ) , versus the @xmath6 of each sample , which is not held fixed .",
    "all of these are a priori reasonable potential models , as @xmath6 and @xmath44 are almost uncorrelated with the other potential parameters ( see figure  [ fig : mwpot14_prior ] ) .",
    "thus , for each of the 32 samples , we sample a wide range of halo shapes and overall milky - way masses and between the 32 families we sample a wide range of allowed disk and halo models . combining these 32 independent markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) chains",
    "requires one in principle to compute the relative evidence or marginal likelihood to weight them , but we find that in each of the 32 potential families equally good fits to the stream can be obtained and we simply weight all of the chains equally .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail below , as it has important implications for what information is obtained about the gravitational potential from a single stream .    to transform between galactocentric coordinates and heliocentric coordinates , we fix @xmath69 , the sun s height above the mid - plane @xmath73 , and the solar motion with respect to a circular orbit to @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "even a @xmath75 uncertainty in @xmath76 only affects the inferred forces by @xmath77 , which is smaller than the statistical uncertainties that we find below .    to summarize our stream - modeling methodology : + @xmath78 we only use the observed location of the stream track , not the density along the track or its width or extent .",
    "+ @xmath78 we approximate each stream as a single orbital torus , assuming a single frequency  offset between the progenitor and every location along the observed part of the stream .",
    "we fix the time at which disruption started to @xmath79 , because it does not affect the location of the track in the single - torus approximation and can not be determined without an observation of the extent of the stream ; + @xmath78 we vary the unknown or marginally - constrained phase ",
    "space coordinates of the progenitor of the stream ( the distance and proper - motion vector for pal 5 and the sky location , distance , proper motion , and line - of - sight velocity for gd1 ) . for pal 5",
    "we vary the velocity - dispersion parameter @xmath62 , but we do not for gd1 , because it is degenerate with the unknown location of the progenitor .",
    "+ @xmath78 we consider a wide range of three - component potential models by sampling 32 plausible values of the relative disk  halo",
    " bulge contribution and of the scale parameters of the disk and halo and by for each of these 32 families fully varying the halo axis ratio @xmath6 and the circular velocity @xmath44 without any prior constraint .",
    "for pal 5 , the available data on the stream that we use are ( a ) the stream sky position measurements from sdss from @xcite and ( b ) the line - of - sight velocity measurements of individual stream members from @xcite .",
    "because the latter do not resolve the velocity dispersion within the stream , we use the individual - member measurements as if they were measurements of the line - of - sight velocity of the mean stream track .",
    "we use the position measurements as the measured declination ( dec ) of the track at a given right ascension ( ra ) plus its uncertainty and the line - of - sight velocities similarly as a function of ra .",
    "these data are shown in figure  [ fig : pal5track ] .",
    "while we will show the sky location of the leading arm , we do not use it in the fit because it is so short , but takes about as long to predict as the trailing arm .",
    "we further fix the following coordinates of the pal 5 cluster as the stream progenitor : ra = 229@xmath80018 , dec = @xmath81@xmath80124 , and @xmath82 .",
    "while the line - of - sight velocity has a @xmath83 uncertainty , this is much smaller than the uncertainty in the distance and proper motion of the pal 5 cluster and it therefore does not affect the stream track significantly .",
    "we use the measurement of the proper motion of the pal 5 cluster from @xcite : @xmath84",
    ". however , the proper motion uncertainty is large enough that it has a big impact on the location of the stream track .",
    "we include the proper motion in our fits and add the @xcite measurement to the likelihood .",
    "because we find that the direction of the @xcite proper - motion measurement is almost exactly aligned with the direction of the stream , we use an alternative parameterization of the proper motion in terms of a component @xmath85 in the direction of @xmath86 and a component @xmath87 perpendicular to this direction ( toward @xmath88 )",
    ". measurements of the distance to the pal 5 cluster range from @xmath89 to @xmath90 @xcite and we conservatively assume a flat prior on the distance between @xmath4 and @xmath91 .    to get a sense of how the various model parameters affect the location of the pal 5 stream , we have computed the stream track varying the halo axis ratio , the circular velocity , and the distance and parallel proper - motion offset . as the fiducial model around which these parameters are varied we assume a distance of @xmath90 , the @xcite best - fit proper motion , a stream velocity - dispersion parameters @xmath92 , and the best - fit three - component potential to the data in @xmath15  [ sec : priorfit ] obtained by fixing @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath69 ( this potential is almost exactly the same as ` mwpotential2014 ` , except that its parameters have not been rounded to convenient values ; see @xcite ) . these track variations are displayed in figure  [ fig : pal5track ] .",
    "it is clear that the track , both on the sky and in line - of - sight velocity , varies significantly when the parameters are varied over a reasonable range . in particular , the circular - velocity , the distance , and the proper motion of the progenitor affect the stream track in a similar manner in both sky position and velocity",
    "therefore , in fitting these data a model has significant leeway to trade differences in @xmath44 for differences in the distance and proper motion of the progenitor .",
    "however , it is also immediately clear from figure  [ fig : pal5track ] that changing the halo axis ratio , which changes the overall flattening of the potential and thus the ratio of the vertical and radial forces , changes the sky position and the line - of - sight velocity of the stream track in a manner that is perpendicular to changes induced by the other model parameters .",
    "that is , when @xmath95 is increased , the distance is decreased , or the proper motion is increased , the trailing tail of the stream moves toward higher declinations and lower velocities . when the halo axis ratio is increased , the trailing track moves toward both higher declinations and higher velocities .",
    "thus , when fitting the data , the halo axis ratio can be measured independently from the other parameters , which among themselves will have a high degree of degeneracy .",
    "we explore the posterior pdf of each of the 32 potential families ( see above ) using mcmc and combine all chains to provide a sampling of the model parameters .",
    "we find the halo axis ratio to be @xmath96 .",
    "as expected , we find that the halo axis ratio is uncorrelated with @xmath95 or the distance and parallel proper - motion offset of the progenitor . there is a slight degeneracy between @xmath6 and the component of the proper motion perpendicular to the @xcite measurement , but the perpendicular component itself is found to be well constrained ( @xmath97 ) so this only has a small impact and a much better proper - motion measurement would be necessary to reduce the degeneracy .",
    "that @xmath87 is so close to zero is surprising given the @xmath98 uncertainty in its measurement by @xcite , but this is simply due to chance .",
    "the parameters @xmath95 , the distance @xmath99 , and parallel proper - motion offset are mutually degenerate : we find @xmath100 , @xmath101 ( the asymmetric uncertainty is due to our prior that @xmath102 ) , and @xmath103 .",
    "we also find that @xmath104 , with only a minor correlation with @xmath105 .",
    "this @xmath62 leads to a stream width of @xmath106 fwhm , in good agreement with the measurement from @xcite , especially considering that we assume an age of @xmath66 for the pal 5 stream .",
    "this @xmath62 also gives a line - of - sight velocity dispersion in the stream of @xmath83 , at the low end of , but consistent with the measurements from @xcite and @xcite , which give a velocity dispersion of @xmath107 .    as already mentioned in @xmath15  [ sec : method ] above , we find that each of the 32 potential families essentially fits the stream equally well ( a single potential did not converge in a short enough time and is not included in the following analysis , although it does not change the results ) .",
    "these potentials explore a wide range of disk - to - halo ratios , disk scale lengths , and halo concentrations .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the observed track of the stream does not hold much information about the global properties of the gravitational potential .",
    "an arm of a stream is approximately at a constant frequency and therefore corresponds to a single orbital torus along which energy should be conserved .",
    "this energy conservation is ensured by balancing the work done by the kinetic energy when going from one end of the stream to the other .",
    "thus , we expect the force along the stream to be a robustly measured quantity . to test this hypothesis , we compute the force in all of the potentials that we consider at a fiducial location for the pal 5 cluster . that is , we fix the distance to be @xmath108 , which places the cluster at @xmath109 ; this conveniently has @xmath110 .",
    "examples of prior and posterior pdfs for the radial and vertical forces at the fiducial pal 5 location are displayed in figure  [ fig : pal5postex ] for four of the 32 potential families that we consider ( chosen to illustrate the range of force fields included in our models ) .",
    "the grayscale density shows the prior on the forces when varying the parameters of the potential model , @xmath6 and @xmath95 for each potential : curves of constant @xmath6 run from the upper - right to the lower - left edge , curves of constant @xmath95 run from the upper - left to the lower - right edge .",
    "the blue contours display the posterior pdf for the particular potential and the orange contours are the posterior pdf from considering all of the potentials .",
    "this figure demonstrates that even though the prior on the forces can vary significantly among the 32 potential families , the posterior pdf always prefers the same forces ( as much as allowed by each particular potential s prior on the forces ) .",
    "the prior , posterior , and their ratio  the likelihood  considering all potentials is shown in figure  [ fig : pal5post ] .",
    "the prior is obtained by sampling @xmath6 and @xmath95 from their prior range for all 32 potential families and computing the forces for all of these potentials .",
    "the middle panel displays the posterior pdf , which is much narrower than the prior .",
    "because even the uninformative , flat priors on @xmath6 and @xmath95 lead to a non - flat prior for the forces ( the left panel ) , we need to divide the posterior by the prior in the two - dimensional plane of the forces to know what information about the forces is obtained from the pal 5 data alone . this",
    "is shown in the left panel .",
    "the likelihood is similar to the posterior , but slightly wider .",
    "this anisotropy in the likelihood is expected from figure  [ fig : pal5track ] : the flattening is uncorrelated with the other model parameters , while the normalization of the forces is correlated with the distance and proper motion of the pal 5 cluster .",
    "the likelihood in figure  [ fig : pal5post ] displays a clear degeneracy between the radial and vertical force .",
    "the dashed line shows the location of a constant flattening of the total potential , defined as @xmath111 where @xmath110 for pal 5 .",
    "it is clear that the degeneracy between @xmath112 and @xmath58 runs along the line of constant @xmath12 .",
    "the constraint in the direction perpendicular to this line is three times narrower than that parallel to the line .",
    "we can therefore summarize the information about the milky way s gravitational potential learned from the pal 5 stream data in the direction of the two principal directions of the likelihood in figure  [ fig : pal5post ] in the following convenient manner : @xmath113 and @xmath114 where @xmath112 and @xmath58 are measured in @xmath115 at @xmath109 and @xmath116@xmath804 .",
    "samples from the mcmc chains are compared with the data in figure  [ fig : pal5samples ] .",
    "all of these fit the data well . as discussed above",
    ", we did not include the sky location of the leading arm in the fit , but it is nevertheless well recovered .",
    "we also show the predicted track of the stream in distance and ( parallel ) proper motion .",
    "the weak distance gradient is consistent with the weak gradient observed by @xcite .",
    "the samples are color - coded by the value of the vertical force at pal 5 s location , to illustrate how the measurement in equation   could be improved by future data .",
    "it is clear that better measurements of the sky location or line - of - sight velocity , even at larger distances from the cluster , do not distinguish between different values of @xmath58 well .",
    "similarly , measurements of the distance gradient along the stream will not improve the force measurements , because the gradient is similar in all allowed models .",
    "however , a better measurement of the proper motion of the pal 5 cluster or a measurement of the stream s proper motion ( both with @xmath117 ) would significantly improve the force measurements .",
    "a previous analysis of similar pal 5 stream data was performed by @xcite , who claim tight constraints on the mass , scale radius , and potential - flattening @xmath118 of the dark ",
    "matter halo based on these data .",
    "we find , however , that the pal 5 stream data on their own contain very little information about the mass and scale radius of the dark ",
    "matter halo . to investigate why our results differ from those of @xcite",
    ", we perform some simple experiments .",
    "first , we sample the parameters of the potential model used by @xcite using the same flat priors as @xcite , but requiring that @xmath44 is between @xmath71 and @xmath119 ( their prior on @xmath44 ) and that the overall potential flattening is constrained to be @xmath120 , as we find from the pal 5 data .",
    "we find no preference for any mass or scale radius of the dark ",
    "matter halo in this case , except for a strong degeneracy between these quantities because of the limited range in @xmath95 .",
    "however , we find that @xmath121 in good agreement with @xcite",
    ". we can add in a constraint similar to that found in equation  , but changed to be consistent with @xcite s best - fit total force amplitude ( which is consistent with ours within the uncertainties ) . in this case",
    ", we still find that there is hardly any constraint on the mass or scale radius of the halo , except that the allowed mass range for a given scale radius is reduced ; the constraint on @xmath118 remains the same .",
    "thus , we conclude that our measurements in equations  ( [ eq : pal5qm ] ) and ( [ eq : pal5fm ] ) are weaker than those claimed by @xcite .",
    "this difference may be due to the fact that @xcite ascribe and fit overdensities along the stream as resulting from pericentric stripping episodes , thus in essence adding a constraint on the radial frequency of the orbit . because the significance of the observed overdensities is contested @xcite and because overdensities could be due to subhalo encounters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , not employing the overdensities as a constraint on the gravitational potential appears to be the conservative thing to do . in summary ,",
    "our measurements of @xmath12 and the force at pal 5 are consistent with , but more conservative than the measurements of @xcite .",
    "for gd1 , we fit the data from @xcite , which is shown in figure  [ fig : gd1track ] .",
    "these data come in the form of the location of the track in a set of custom sky coordinates @xmath122 with @xmath68 approximately aligned with the stream .",
    "we use the measurements of the stream phase ",
    "space location as a function of @xmath68 in @xmath123 , distance , and proper motion .",
    "similar to the analysis of the pal 5 data above , we also treat the line - of - sight velocity measurements of stream members as measurements of the track location in line - of - sight velocity at each star s @xmath68 , because these measurements do not resolve the velocity dispersion of the stream .",
    "because for gd1 we have data on all six phase  space coordinates of the stream , the location of the progenitor  in our approximation of the stream track  is much better constrained than that of pal 5 ( especially because the distance to gd1 is much better constrained than that to pal 5 above ) . as discussed above , we fix the progenitor s location to @xmath124 and @xmath125 and thus model the gd1 stream as being a leading arm .",
    "we stress that this is simply the location of the progenitor in our approximation , not the true location of the progenitor .",
    "we explore the sensitivity of the stream track to the gravitational potential in figure  [ fig : gd1track ] .",
    "similar to the sensitivity analysis for pal 5 in figure  [ fig : pal5track ] , we use the bulge , disk , and halo parameters of the best - fit three - component potential to the data in @xmath15  [ sec : priorfit ] obtained by fixing @xmath93 , @xmath126 , and @xmath69 as the fiducial potential family , but we find the best - fitting @xmath6 , @xmath44 , and gd1 progenitor parameters by fitting to the gd1 data in order to have a fiducial model that fits the data well for this sensitivity analysis .",
    "we then vary @xmath6 and @xmath95 around their best - fitting values and compute the stream track in all phase  space components .",
    "the results from this are displayed in figure  [ fig : gd1track ] .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : gd1track ] that varying the halo axis ratio has almost no effect on the stream s track in distance or any of the velocity components .",
    "changing @xmath95 has a small effect in the same components .",
    "however , the stream s location on the sky varies significantly for different @xmath6 or @xmath95 . within this potential family ,",
    "@xmath95 can be constrained by the stream s distance , proper motion , and line - of - sight velocity independent of @xmath6 and the stream s location in the sky can then essentially constrain @xmath6 . thus",
    ", we again expect little to no correlation between the constraints on @xmath6 and those on the other parameters of the model for the gd1 data .",
    "@xmath95 will similarly again be somewhat degenerate with the phase ",
    "space location of the progenitor .",
    "we explore the posterior pdf for the potential and progenitor parameters for gd1 using mcmc for the 32 potential families . because for gd1",
    ", unlike for pal 5 , we have measurements of all six phase  space components the fit is more strongly constrained and every potential family prefers similar parameters .",
    "we find that @xmath127 with no significant correlations with any of the other model parameters .",
    "the circular velocity is constrained to be @xmath128 , correlated with the proper motion of the progenitor .",
    "the progenitor is at @xmath129@xmath8082@xmath130@xmath8008@xmath131 .",
    "the only significant correlations between the progenitor parameters are between the proper motion components .",
    "similar to the fit to pal 5 above , we find that each of the 32 potential families provides an equally - good fit to the gd1 data .",
    "thus , the gd1 data again do not hold much information about the global properties of the gravitational potential . a similar investigation to",
    "that shown in figure  [ fig : pal5postex ] demonstrates again that while the effective prior on the local radial and vertical force differs significantly between the 32 potential families , the posterior pdf of the forces near gd1 is almost exactly the same in all 32 cases . here ,",
    "we compute the forces at @xmath132 and @xmath133 , chosen to be close to the center of the gd1 stream data .",
    "the prior and posterior pdf for the radial and vertical force at the center of the gd1 data is displayed in figure  [ fig : gd1post ] combining the results from all 32 potential families .",
    "it is clear that the posterior is much more sharply peaked than the prior and that the gd1 data therefore strongly constrain the force field in their vicinity .",
    "the ratio of the posterior and the prior ( the likelihood ) is shown in the right panel .",
    "much as for pal 5 , the likelihood is anisotropic with the principal axes approximately aligned with the directions of constant overall potential flattening @xmath12 and the direction perpendicular to this . for gd1 , the likelihood peaks at @xmath134 .",
    "the ratio of the widths in the two principal directions is again about three .",
    "we can thus summarize the information about the gravitational potential provided by the gd1 data alone as @xmath135 and @xmath136 where @xmath112 and @xmath58 are measured in @xmath115 at @xmath132 and @xmath137 .",
    "samples from the mcmc chains for gd1 are compared with the data in figure  [ fig : gd1samples ] .",
    "all of these match the data well .",
    "the samples are color - coded by their value of the vertical force near the center of the stream , to illustrate how the measurement in equation   could be improved by future data .",
    "it is clear that the main improvement would again come from sub @xmath138 measurements of the proper motion along the stream .",
    "the gd1 data that we fit in the previous subsection was previously analyzed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "because @xcite fit an orbit to this data , which is improper and has been superseded by the @xcite analysis , we focus on the latter , but briefly return to @xcite at the end of this subsection .",
    "@xcite perform a similar fit as the one in this paper , fitting a stream track to the phase ",
    "space location of the data , but they compute the model stream tracks using orbit integration of tracer particles stripped from a model progenitor and assume a simple flattened logarithmic potential rather than the three - component potential that we use . apart from the difference in potential , this is essentially the same approach as we follow here , except that their prescription for the phase ",
    "space distribution of the tidal debris at the time of stripping is different from ours in detail and that we use action  angle coordinates to compute a smooth representation of the present - day track , while they use monte - carlo orbit integration to reconstruct the present - day track .",
    "thus , we expect to find essentially the same results as @xcite . however , our constraints on the potential flattening and @xmath95 are significantly tighter than those found by @xcite .",
    "to investigate the cause of this difference , we have repeated our fit to the gd1 data , but using a flattened logarithmic potential with free parameters @xmath12 and @xmath95 ( @xmath139 $ ] ) , setting @xmath140 ( but we get similar results for @xmath141 ) , and using the same flat priors as @xcite . in this case",
    "the fit is much faster than for our three - component potential families , because orbit integration in this simple potential is much faster , and we can obtain 10,000 mcmc samples in a matter of hours .",
    "we find that @xmath142 and @xmath143 in this case .",
    "the constraint on @xmath12 is weaker than in the case of the three - component potential models and is in good agreement with that of @xcite ; we also recover the same correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath95 .",
    "our best - fit value for @xmath95 is somewhat smaller than that of @xcite although within the formal uncertainties , which may be due in part because of our higher assumed solar - motion component @xmath76 . ; the uncertainty in @xmath95 is similar .",
    "overall , the two analyses agree well .    therefore , we conclude that our modeling of the gd1 data in terms of three - component potential families provides tighter constraints on the gravitational potential than using a simple logarithmic potential .",
    "this is probably due , at least in part , to the fact that the simple logarithmic potential does not realistically describe the structure of the potential .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the offset between a tidal stream and a single orbit is very small for the flattened logarithmic potential and @xcite also find that simply fitting the gd1 data as an orbit returns the same results as their stream fit .",
    "however , gd1 is close enough to the disk that in a more realistic potential the stream  orbit offset is larger and varies with @xmath12 @xcite . comparing orbits to the stream tracks for pal 5 and gd1 shown in figures  [ fig : pal5track ] and [ fig : gd1track ] directly demonstrates that the location of the tracks varies more than that of orbits when changing the potential .",
    "provided that one is willing to assume that the potential is closer to a disk - plus - halo than to a logarithmic potential , this effect should lead to stronger constraints on the potential and our modeling of the potential in terms of three - component potential families capitalizes on this .",
    "finally , @xcite claim that the gd1 data can not constrain the flattening of the halo without informative priors on the disk and only find a lower limit @xmath144 from the gd1 data .",
    "we , however , find that the gd1 data do provide an informative constraint on the shape of the halo .",
    "this is in part due to the fact that we only allow reasonable values for the mass of the disk . even though our potential families explore a wide range of possible disk parameters",
    ", the disk always has @xmath145 , while @xcite allow unrealistic values above this value and have a maximum - likelihood @xmath146 . however ,",
    "this is not the only cause of our better constraint , because we find the same best - fit value of @xmath147 for all potential families and furthermore , @xmath6 is uncorrelated with @xmath44 , which scales the mass of the disk within each family .",
    "thus , the main improvement comes from properly modeling the gd1 data as a stream in a three - component potential , which leads to tighter constraints on the potential and on @xmath6 in particular .",
    "it is clear that the pal 5 data provide a more direct measurement of the shape of the halo than the gd1 data , because the pal 5 data are located much further from the disk than the gd1 data .",
    "in sections  [ sec : pal5 ] and [ sec : gd1 ] above , we inferred values of the halo axis ratio of @xmath148 and @xmath127 for the pal 5 and gd1 streams .",
    "these measurements were obtained by fitting general potential families , inspired by fits to data on the rotation curve , vertical kinematics , etc . from @xmath15  [ sec : priorfit ] , but not required to provide a good fit to those data .",
    "we saw that each of 32 potential families provided an equally good fit to the stream data and that the inferred value of @xmath6 was uncorrelated with @xmath95 , indicating that these @xmath6 values should not be significantly changed if we further require the potential to fit the constraints from @xmath15  [ sec : priorfit ] . in this section",
    "we perform fits to the data in @xmath15  [ sec : priorfit ] plus the measurements for pal 5 from equations  ( [ eq : pal5qm ] ) and ( [ eq : pal5fm ] ) and for gd1 from equations  ( [ eq : gd1qm ] ) and ( [ eq : gd1fm ] ) .",
    "first , we add the pal 5 and gd1 constraints separately , obtaining @xmath149 for pal 5 and @xmath150 for gd1 , in line with the measurements from the stream data directly , but with slightly different uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainties for gd1 are somewhat larger than those found from considering the 32 potential families in @xmath15  [ sec : gd1constraints ] because we no longer demand that @xmath151the prior in the analysis in @xmath15  [ sec : gd1constraints]and because we only use the gd1 constraints on the forces , not the full gd1 data .",
    "the @xmath6 values obtained for pal 5 and gd1 are uncorrelated with any of the other potential parameters describing the bulge , disk , and halo or with @xmath43 and @xmath44 . because gd1 is located at a galactocentric radius of @xmath152 and pal 5 at a radius of @xmath153 , this hints at a decrease in the axis ratio with galactocentric radius , although the values are entirely consistent with each other .    fitting all constraints simultaneously , we find that @xmath154 , again with no correlation with any of the other parameters describing the potential .",
    "the @xmath155 range spans @xmath156 to @xmath157 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mwpot14_post ] displays the joint two - dimensional posterior pdf for @xmath6 versus all of the other model parameters , similar to figure  [ fig : mwpot14_prior ] before the addition of the stream data . the halo is thus constrained to be spherical to about @xmath158 . the scale radius of the dark ",
    "matter halo is constrained to be @xmath159 , which is a significant improvement over the constraint without the pal 5 or gd1 data ( which was @xmath160 ) .",
    "this improvement is due to the additional force measurements at @xmath161 and @xmath162 , which allow the radial profile of the halo to be better determined .",
    "the mass of the dark ",
    "matter halo within 20 kpc is also well constrained by these data : @xmath163 ( we define the mass as the average of @xmath164 at constant spherical @xmath165 for the non - spherical dark  matter halos , but the exact definition is unimportant as we find the halo to be consistent with spherical ) .",
    "such a halo mass and scale radius are fully consistent with the expected mass and concentration for the milky way s halo .",
    "to investigate how these results depend on the assumed density distribution of the disk , we have repeated this fit for a double - exponential disk model without and with an additional gas component that is the same as that in @xmath15  [ sec : priorfit ] .",
    "the best - fit value of the halo axis ratio in both cases is slightly , but not very significantly , lower : @xmath166 and @xmath167 for without and with gas , respectively ; the @xmath155 lower limit is @xmath168 in both cases .",
    "the mass within 20 kpc and the scale radius of the halo are almost unchanged .",
    "the detailed mass profile of the disk therefore only has a minor effect .",
    "the scale length and height of the disk in all of the disk models , or @xmath43 and @xmath44 are as expected not significantly better constrained after adding in the stream constraints .",
    "as discussed in the introduction of this paper , we expect the milky way , with its massive , maximal disk @xcite to have @xmath169 .",
    "this is almost @xmath155 below our best value for @xmath6 ( the @xmath155 lower limit is @xmath170 ) .",
    "thus , our finding that the halo is spherical is in tension with the predictions from numerical simulations .",
    "better data on the pal 5 and gd1 streams from , e.g. , _ gaia _ or similar data on additional streams will allow us in the near future to better determine whether this tension is real or not .",
    "to summarize current measurements of the force field in the inner milky way , we display the force field in the best - fit model in figure  [ fig : forcefield ] .",
    "we include direct measurements of the forces from the pal 5 and gd1 streams from this paper to demonstrate how they agree with those derived from the joint fit .",
    "we also include a summary of the results on the rotation curve @xcite and vertical - force curve @xcite .",
    "because these are not measured at the same location ( the rotation curve being measured at @xmath171 and the vertical force measured at @xmath172 ) , we move the radial - force measurements from the rotation curve to @xmath173 using the fact that @xmath174 @xcite and assuming the @xmath175 measured by @xcite . while there remains a large volume to be explored , this figure clearly demonstrates the improvement in our understanding of the halo s potential and its shape provided by the pal 5 and gd1 force measurements .",
    "in this paper we have performed the first proper stream fits to observational data using the action  angle approach to modeling stellar streams ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is also the first analysis to combine data from multiple streams to improve our knowledge of the milky way s gravitational potential within 20 kpc from the center .    comparing our fits to previous analyses of the same ( for gd1 ) or similar ( for pal 5 ) data",
    ", we note that our analysis is much faster while simultaneously exploring a wider range of potentials than that considered by @xcite for gd1 and @xcite for pal 5 .",
    "because the action  angle approach directly provides a smooth stream track that can be computed using @xmath176 orbit integrations per model , we can evaluate the likelihood of different models in tens of seconds .",
    "this is the case , even though we are modeling the dark ",
    "matter halo using the flattened density of equation  , for which computing the potential and forces is non - trivial and requires numerical integration . by approximating the stream as a single orbital torus over the observable , high - surface brightness part of the stream",
    ", we also keep the number of parameters the same as in the orbit fit of gd1 by @xcite ( for a single of our 32 potential families ) , which means that our fit explores a volume of the same dimensionality as in the simple orbit approximation , while properly fitting a stream .",
    "thus , we are able to fit the stream without resorting to high - performance computing and are thus able to easily fit multiple streams .    by exploring a wide range of potential families for both the pal 5 and gd1 streams",
    ", we have shown that the only information gained about the milky way s gravitational potential appears to be the local forces .",
    "this is because we can fit these streams equally well for all a priori likely potentials that explore a wide range of disk - to - halo ratios , disk profiles , and halo radial profiles .",
    "however , in each of 32 potential families that we consider for each stream , the a posteriori probable forces in the vicinity of the stream are the same . despite this , we find that the _ form _ of the potential does matter in the fit , because comparing the results of our three - component potential fits to a simple logarithmic - potential fit , we find tighter and somewhat different constraints on the local forces .",
    "this is due to the fact that our three - component potential families properly take into account the effect of the varying offset between the stream track and an orbit for different potentials , which is absent in the less realistic logarithmic potential .    for both the pal 5 and gd1 streams",
    ", we find that the ratio of the local forces is more strongly constrained than their overall amplitude .",
    "this is because , when fitting the phase  space data for both streams , an overall force - amplitude change can be traded off for differences in the distance or proper motion of the stream or progenitor ( see figures  [ fig : pal5track ] and [ fig : gd1track ] ) .",
    "therefore , we express our constraints on the gravitational potential from both streams in terms of a measurement of the potential flattening @xmath12 on the one hand and in terms of a constraint on the forces projected onto the direction of constant flattening .",
    "these constraints are given in equations   and for pal 5 and equations   and for gd1 .",
    "all of these constraints have divided out the effective prior due to the potential families used in the fit and are therefore pure measurements based on the data for pal 5 and gd1 alone .",
    "the new force measurements are summarized in figure  [ fig : forcefield ] , which demonstrates that they agree very well with the overall best - fit force field to a variety of dynamical data in addition to the stream data from this paper .    because the streams considered here are exquisitely sensitive to the flattening of the potential , they provide a strong constraint on the axis ratio @xmath6 of the dark ",
    "matter halo s density . for gd1 and",
    "pal 5 individually we measure @xmath150 for gd1 ( @xmath161 ) and @xmath149 for pal 5 ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "the gd1 constraint is weaker because the stream is located much closer to the disk ; the pal 5 constraint is especially stringent because at its @xmath177 location , the potential is almost entirely dominated by the dark ",
    "matter halo and the overall potential flattening that we measure ( @xmath178 ) is almost directly that of the halo .",
    "while the estimates are consistent , the radial trend is towards a more oblate halo further out .",
    "the combined constraint from pal 5 and gd1 is @xmath179 .",
    "this measurement of the halo axis ratio is obtained in the context of a three - component potential model for the milky way , but displays no correlations with the other parameters describing the potential .",
    "this result is at odds with the misaligned , triaxial halo at @xmath180 found to describe the kinematics of the sgr stream well @xcite . from numerical simulations including the effect of growing a massive baryonic disk",
    ", we expect the milky way to have @xmath181 , which is in @xmath182 tension with our measurement . while the tension is too mild currently to strongly disfavor the collisionless cold dark matter model for the formation of dark matter halos , this hints at interactions in the dark sector that sphericalize the milky way halo .",
    "we also measure the total mass of the halo within 20 kpc to be @xmath183 with a scale radius of @xmath159 .",
    "such a halo mass and scale radius are fully consistent with the expected mass and concentration for the milky way s halo .",
    "the available data on tidal streams will soon increase in both quantity and quality with the release of the _ gaia _ data . especially the precise , sub @xmath138 proper motion measurements for the brightest stream members will significantly improve the measurements of the local forces from these streams ( see figure  [ fig : pal5samples ] and figure  [ fig : gd1samples ] ) .",
    "it will also increase the amount of data on other , more distant streams like the orphan stream and potentially wholly new streams .",
    "the methodology of the @xcite stream model as used in this paper will then allow fast , flexible fits to all of the different streams that can be combined to further build up our direct measurements of the force field as in figure  [ fig : forcefield ] and be interpreted in terms of disk and halo models . because steady  state modeling of the smooth halo will also allow tight constraints on the gravitational forces in the same volume , a comparison between the results from steady  state modeling ",
    "sensitive to the current forces  and those from streams ",
    "affected by the forces over the entire lifetime of the stream  may also allow direct inferences about the growth of the milky way s dark  matter halo ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
