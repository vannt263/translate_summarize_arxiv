    "a major result in ergodic theory in the late 1980 s was the proof of the return times theorem by j. bourgain @xcite ( which was later simplified by j. bourgain , h. furstenberg , y. katznelson , d. ornstein in @xcite ) .",

    "one of the keys to the argument was to decompose the given function using the kronecker factor in order to prove the result independently for both the eigenfunctions and those functions in the orthocomplement of the kronecker factor .",
    "using factors in convergence proofs in ergodic theory has long been a very useful tool .",
    "the notion of a characteristic factor is originally due to h. furstenberg and is explicitly defined by h. furstenberg and b. weiss in @xcite .",

    "the uniform upper bounds are derived after integration combined with a @xmath56 argument .",
