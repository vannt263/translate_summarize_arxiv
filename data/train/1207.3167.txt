    "the idea of embedding our universe in a higher dimensional non - compactified space - time has attracted considerable interest in the last decade , due to the proposal by randall and sundrum  @xcite that our four - dimensional ( 4d ) space - time could be a three - brane embedded in a 5-dimensional ( 5d ) space - time ( the bulk ) . according to the brane - world scenario , the physical fields ( electromagnetic , yang - mills etc . ) observed in our 4d universe are confined to the three - brane .",
    "only gravity can freely propagate both on the brane and in the bulk , with the gravitational self - couplings not significantly modified .",
    "the model allows for a large , or even infinite non - compact extra dimension , in the simplest case the brane being identified to a domain wall in a 5d anti - de sitter space - time .",
    "even with the fifth dimension uncompactified , standard 4d gravity can be reproduced on the brane in a certain limit . for a review of the dynamics and geometry of brane universes ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .    at very high energies , in the presence of large 5d curvatures , significant deviations from the standard einstein theory could occur in brane - world models , due to the nonstandard model 5d fields , possible asymmetric embeddings of the brane into the bulk or a variable brane tension  sms00,311 . at the electro - weak scale of about 1  tev gravity",
    "is largely modified .",
    "the cosmological and astrophysical implications of the brane - world theories have been extensively investigated in the physical literature  all2,hgh , sol .    on the vacuum brane",
    "the gravitational field equations depend on the generally unknown brane projections of the weyl curvature of the bulk , generating non - local brane stresses , which in a spherically symmetric setup can be expressed in terms of two functions , the dark radiation @xmath1 and the dark pressure @xmath2 , respectively @xcite . on a vacuum brane",
    "several classes of spherically symmetric solutions of the static gravitational field equations have been found in @xcite .",
    "dark matter is one of the central issues in modern astrophysics ( see @xcite for an extensive review of the recent results of the search for dark matter ) .",
    "the necessity of considering the existence of dark matter at a galactic and extra - galactic scale is required by two fundamental observational evidences , the behavior of the galactic rotation curves , and the mass discrepancy in clusters of galaxies , respectively . on the galactic / intergalactic scale the rotation curves of spiral galaxies  binney , sal2 , sal3",
    "provide one of the best evidences showing the problems newtonian gravity and/or standard general relativity have to face .",
    "the rotational velocities of hydrogen clouds in stable circular orbits increase near the center of the galaxy , in agreement with the standard gravitational theory , but then remain nearly constant at a value of @xmath3 km / s  @xcite .",
    "hence we obtain a mass profile of the form @xmath4 .",
    "this result implies that the mass within a distance @xmath5 from the center of the galaxy increases linearly with @xmath6 , even at large distances where very little luminous matter does exist .",
    "the second important astrophysical evidence for dark matter comes from the study of the clusters of galaxies .",
    "generally it is found that the virial mass @xmath7 is considerably greater than the observed baryonic mass @xmath8 , @xmath9 , typical values of @xmath10 being about 20 - 30  @xcite .",
    "this behavior of the galactic rotation curves and of the virial mass of galaxy clusters is usually explained by postulating the existence of some dark ( invisible ) matter , distributed in a spherical halo around the galaxies .",
    "the dark matter is assumed to be a cold , pressure - less medium .",
    "many possible candidates for dark matter have been proposed , the most popular ones being the wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) ( for a review of the particle physics aspects of the dark matter see  @xcite ) . while extremely small , their interaction cross sections with normal baryonic matter , are expected to be non - zero , so that their direct experimental detection may be possible .",
    "however , up to now no direct evidence or annihilation radiation from dark matter has been observed , and no non - gravitational evidence for dark matter does exist . therefore , it seems that the possibility that einstein s ( and the newtonian ) theory of gravity breaks down at the scale of galaxies can not be excluded _",
    "a priori_.    in brane - world models the rotational galactic curves can be naturally explained without introducing any supplementary hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the non - zero contribution of the weyl tensor from the bulk generates a modified , spherically symmetric geometry , in which galaxies are embedded .",
    "the dark radiation @xmath1 and the dark pressure @xmath2 act similarly to a matter  distribution outside the galaxy .",
    "the particles moving in this geometry feel the gravitational effects of @xmath1 , which can be expressed in terms of an equivalent mass ( the dark mass ) @xmath11 .",
    "the dark mass is linearly increasing with the distance , and proportional to the baryonic mass of the galaxy , @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "therefore it would be of uttermost importance to have independent tests , which could discern between various dark matter models and modified gravity models , which include brane - worlds .",
    "gravitational lensing and the study of the light deflection by black holes and galaxies is an important physical effect that could provide specific signatures for testing the brane - world models ( for a review of the gravitational lensing by brane - world black holes see @xcite ) .",
    "observables related to the relativistic images of strong field gravitational lensing could in principle be used to distinguish between different brane - world black hole metrics in future observations .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to consider the lensing in the dark radiation dominated region of the brane - world models .",
    "physically , this region corresponds to particles gravitating in circular orbits and at constant speed around the galactic center  @xcite .",
    "the galactic rotation curves show a large variety of behaviors , and , in particular , they also depend on the considered galaxy type . by analyzing an extended set of spiral galaxy rotation curves",
    "it has been proposed that the rotation curves of these galaxies can be described by a universal rotation curve ( urc ) @xcite .",
    "n - body simulations provide a universal mass profile in the @xmath13 cold dark matter ( @xmath13cdm ) cosmological scenario , and , consequently , a universal equilibrium circular velocity of the virialized objects , as galaxies . by combining kinematical data of inner galactic regions with global observational properties ,",
    "the urc of disc galaxies and the corresponding mass distribution out to their virial radius was obtained .",
    "the existence of a universal rotation curve is also consistent with the predictions of the brane world models , which imply the existence of of a universal weyl fluid , acting in a uniform way at all galactic scales . in the present paper",
    ", we will analyze the lensing properties in both the constant velocity region of the rotation curves , as well as in the declining or increasing regions , where the behavior of the rotation curves can be modeled by a simple power law @xcite .    by fixing two radius values at the observer and source , respectively ,",
    "we derive an exact lens equation relating two angular variables .",
    "this equation allows to obtain all the observationally relevant quantities , like image position , the apparent brightness and the image distortions .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review the basic properties of the brane world models and of the weyl fluid in section  [ sect2 ] . the metric properties valid in the region of constant or power law type tangential velocities are also discussed .",
    "the mathematical problem of the embedding is considered in section  [ emb ] .",
    "particular solutions of the field equations describing the geoemtric properties in the constant and power law velocity regions are presented in section  [ sect4 ] .",
    "the deflection of light and the lensing properties in the brane world models in the weyl fluid dominated regions are obtained in section  [ sect5 ] . in section  [ sect6 ]",
    "we compare the theoretical predictions of the model with the observational data .",
