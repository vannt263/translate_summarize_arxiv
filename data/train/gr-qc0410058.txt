    "it gives me great pleasure to dedicate this note to mike ryan in honor of his 60th birthday .",
    "it is especially rewarding to be able to include several of mike s favorite research themes including mixmaster dynamics and spatially inhomogeneous cosmologies  where he has made important contributions .",
    "the @xmath0 formulation of einstein s equations has served as the starting point for most numerical simulations . while the precise set of einstein s equations most suitable for simulations is a subject of active investigation ( for a review see @xcite ) , the basic structure of the adm form  evolution equations for ( something related to ) the induced spatial metric and ( something related to ) the spatial extrinsic curvature plus ( some form of ) the hamiltonian and momentum constraints  will most likely remain . as is well known , the einstein evolution equations preserve the constraints but the discretized evolution equations need not do so . to date , most simulations of binary black holes and/or neutron stars have solved only the evolution equations .",
    "experience with these simulations has demonstrated that failure to solve the constraints allows the growth of constraint violating modes that can cause the codes to crash .",
    "the main argument against numerical enforcement of the constraints has been the cost in compute time of solving the elliptic constraint equations .",
    "advances in computational power , improved elliptic solvers , and the growing awareness of the problem of instabilities caused by constraint violation have led to increased interest in constrained evolution @xcite .    in this note ,",
    "i shall discuss a further reason to consider constrained evolution  especially for the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is given schematically by @xmath1 = 0\\ ] ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are respectively the extrinsic curvature and induced metric of the spatial hypersurface , @xmath4 is the determinant of @xmath3 , @xmath5 $ ] is the scalar curvature of @xmath3 , and @xmath6 is the trace of @xmath2 . note first the indefinite sign of @xmath7 which can appear in either the `` kinetic '' terms involving @xmath2 or in the  potential \" term containing @xmath8 .",
    "thus to maintain the solution @xmath9 requires a delicate balance among the variables .",
    "failure to achieve this balance in a numerical simulation can yield not only numerical instability but also  even in a stable evolution  qualitatively incorrect behavior . in the following , three examples of collapsing cosmological spacetimes with 3 , 2 , and 1 spatial killing field will be used to illustrate qualitatively incorrect behavior that results if the hamiltonian constraint is allowed to evolve freely in a simulation .    collapsing cosmological spacetimes are characterized by two main types of behavior  asymptotic velocity term dominance ( avtd ) and local mixmaster dynamics ( lmd)first described by belinskii et al ( bkl ) ( e.g.  @xcite )",
    ". both types of behavior arise when the dynamics becomes local ",
    "variables at each spatial point evolve as a separate spatially homogeneous universe .",
    "the basic building block of the approach to the singularity is the kasner universe , characterized by fixed collapse rates along the principle spatial axes .",
    "this is in contrast to bianchi ix ( mixmaster ) collapse where an infinite sequence of `` bounces '' off the spatial scalar curvature change one kasner epoch into another with different fixed collapse rates .",
    "the relationship between one kasner epoch and the next includes bounces that are sensitive to initial conditions and can be determined from conservation of `` momentum '' through the bounce @xcite .",
    "collapsing cosmologies exhibit lmd if , at ( almost ) every spatial point , bounces from one kasner - like epoch to another may be demonstrated and shown to obey the relevant bounce laws .",
    "in contrast , avtd behavior is characterized by a final kasner epoch at ( almost ) every spatial point after a possible final bounce .",
    "rigorous demonstration of avtd behavior has been provided @xcite . with the exception of spatially homogeneous cosmologies @xcite",
    ", lmd has been plausibly demonstrated only through numerical simulation @xcite .    in the remainder of this note",
    ", we shall consider three examples where lmd can be seen only if the hamiltonian constraint is explicitly enforced .",
    "these examples are the spatially homogeneous vacuum , diagonal bianchi ix cosmology @xcite , the two spatial killing field generic @xmath10-symmetric vacuum spacetime @xcite , and the one spatial killing field vacuum @xmath11-symmetric cosmology @xcite .",
    "while failure to enforce the hamiltonian constraint can lead to instability , we shall focus on simulations that evolve stably but indicate that the approach to the singularity is avtd rather than lmd .",
    "the mixmaster universe is described by the metric @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 depend only on the time @xmath16 , and the spatial 1-forms @xmath17 satisfy the appropriate @xmath18 relationship for bianchi ix .",
    "einstein s equations may be found from the variation of the superhamiltonian ( lapse times the hamiltonian constraint ) specialized for these models as @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 are canonically conjugate to @xmath14,@xmath15 and @xmath22 where the ellipsis indicates terms that are ( almost ) always negligible . in the absence of the potential @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 ) , the kasner solution is obtained .",
    "( [ mixmasterh ] ) defines the dynamics in minisuperspace ( mss ) .",
    "the kasner solution represents the free particle in mss . for the kasner solution , eq .",
    "( [ mixmasterh ] ) may be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the addition of the potential ( [ mixmasterv ] ) causes ( almost ) every kasner epoch to end in a bounce off one of the exponential terms in @xmath23 . after the bounce ,",
    "the behavior is again described by ( [ kasnercircle ] ) but with different kasner parameters .",
    "as first discussed by bkl , every kasner epoch can be identiifed by a single parameter @xmath27 ( related to the anisotropic collapse rates ) such that the @xmath28 kasner epoch is related to the @xmath29 one in mixmaster dynamics through @xmath30 as the mixmaster universe evolves toward the singularity , the ratio of the duration of the bounce to the duration of the kasner epoch goes to zero .",
    "the role of the hamiltonian constraint ( [ mixmasterh]) as it becomes arbitrarily close to ( [ kasnercircle ] ) except at the bounce  is to keep the configuration on the `` kasner circle '' defined by @xmath31 .",
    "a typical evolution may be found in @xcite , fig .",
    "a numerical simulation of mixmaster collapse with a code that can follow the evolution through hundreds of bounces @xcite shows qualitatively different behavior depending upon whether or not the hamiltonian constraint is enforced .",
    "figure [ mixkasnercircle ] shows a comparison of the kasner circle indicator @xmath6 vs time @xmath16 for constrained and unconstrained simulations .",
    "the constrained simulation maintains @xmath31 ( except at bounces ) while the unconstrained one evolves to @xmath32 . with @xmath32 ,",
    "the system point is moving too slowly in mss to bounce off the potential .",
    "thus the unconstrained simulation yields the spurious result that the model has a last bounce and is avtd .",
    "the simulation does not become unstable .",
    "there is no code crash  just a physically wrong result .",
    "( from some initial data , the unconstrained evolution leads to @xmath33 .",
    "this does become unstable and crashes . )",
    "figure [ mixkasnercircle ] also compares the evolution from the same initial data while solving the constraint at every @xmath34 time steps for @xmath35 .",
    "the evolution is monitored by the sequence of @xmath27-values obtained for the kasner segments .",
    "two evolutions become qualitatively distinct when the integer parts of @xmath27 differ for the same segment .",
    "the sequence of @xmath27-values obtained from ( [ umap ] ) is sensitive to initial conditions when an era ends [ @xmath36 .",
    "note that the evolutions are qualitatively identical for a large number of bounces independent of @xmath34 and that they begin to differ at about the same place .",
    "this epoch is essentially the point at which information about the initial value of @xmath27 is lost ( in the double precision that is used ) .",
    "thus one can not really choose one of the solutions as more correct than another .",
    "the lesson here appears to be that constraint solving  at least from time to time  is essential for the accurate simulation of collapsing homogeneous mixmaster models .      as our next example",

    "the gowdy model is recovered if @xmath68 . the first order equation for @xmath61 obtained from the variation of ( [ hgal ] )",

    "a typical evolution is shown in @xcite .",
    "the set of equations obtained from the variation of ( [ hgal ] ) plus the momentum constraint do not comprise the full set of einstein equations obtained from ( [ galmetricnew ] ) and expressed as @xmath69 .",
    "one also obtains a redundant wave equation for @xmath61 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this wave equation may be used instead of the hamiltonian constraint to evolve @xmath61 to produce an unconstrained evolution .",
    "figure [ galp ] shows respectively the wave amplitude @xmath59 and @xmath70-like parameter @xmath71 ( see @xcite ) at the same representative spatial point for constrained and unconstrained evolution from the same initial data .",
    "it is clear that the lmd discussed in detail and understood quantitatively in @xcite through `` bounce laws '' for @xmath72 can not be reproduced without explicit enforcement of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "once again , there is no numerical instability associated with failure to enforce the constraint .",
    "three examples have been presented where failure to enforce the hamiltonian constraint has led , not to instability , but to qualitatively incorrect behavior .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint consists of kinetic energy - like and potential energy - like terms . in collapsing cosmologies with lmd behavior , the kinetic terms either dominate or intermittently dominate the dynamics .",
    "if the hamiltonian constraint is not enforced , the relationship among the momenta in the kinetic term will become incorrect .",
    "however , these momenta comprise the coefficients @xmath73 of the time @xmath16 in potential terms of the form @xmath74 .",
    "how these terms grow and decay determine whether the approach to the singularity is avtd or lmd ( see the discussion in @xcite ) . with the wrong coefficient  or even the wrong sign for @xmath73a term that should grow exponentially may decay and vice versa in a numerical simulation .",
    "there are collapsing cosmological spacetimes that do not require explicit enforcement of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "examples already mentioned include the polarized @xmath11 models and the gowdy cosmologies .",
    "thus it seems as if the `` delicate '' lmd behavior must be present for enforcement of the hamiltonian constraint to be needed .",
    "enforcement of the momentum constraint appears to be less critical .",
    "however , momentum constraint violation can be shown to lead to incorrect spatial waveforms in collapsing cosmologies .",
    "garfinkle has demonstrated lmd in generic collapse without explicit constraint enforcement ( although damping was introduced to suppress constraint violating modes ) @xcite .",
    "the variables he used are more naturally adapted to the constraint hypersurface but are not suitable for binary black hole evolution @xcite .",
    "the lesson from the examples presented here is that failure to enforce the hamiltonian constraint can yield qualitatively incorrect behavior in a numerical simulation even in the absence of instability . while this does not occur in all classes of spacetimes and for all choices of variables and formulations ,",
    "failure to enforce the constraint may be dangerous when properties of the solution are unknown .",
