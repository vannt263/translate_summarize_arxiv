    "in cerium , ytterbium , uranium and other anomalous rare - earth and actinide compounds , the interplay between kondo effect and magnetism leads to the formation of various interesting phenomena which still attract large attention .",
    "@xcite both effects depend strongly on the hybridization between @xmath0 and conduction electrons , which in turn significantly influence the level of localization of the @xmath0-electrons .",
    "the extent of the localization is sensitive to various external parameters , such as temperature and pressure , but most importantly to the spatial extension of the orbitals .",
    "actually , in the case of cerium compounds , 4@xmath0-electrons are usually well localized , while in the case of uranium and other actinide compounds , 5@xmath0-electrons can be either localized or itinerant , or in - between , depending on the studied system .",
    "moreover , in the case of 5@xmath0-electrons , the experimental data do not clearly distinguish between a localized 5@xmath7 configuration and a mixed - valence regime .",
    "thus , there is always a challenge to decide which is the best framework for discussing actinide materials .",
    "the nature of the electronic structure of actinide metals has been studied since a long time and extensively reviewed .",
    "@xcite    the difference between the @xmath8- and @xmath4-electrons leads to different magnetic properties of rare - earth and actinide compounds .",
    "@xcite in the case of cerium kondo compounds , a competition between the kondo effect on each ce atom and the magnetic ordering of the ce magnetic moments through the rkky interaction has been successfully described by the so - called `` doniach diagram '' .",
    "@xcite in this diagram , both the nel temperature @xmath9 ( or the curie temperature @xmath10 ) and the kondo temperature @xmath11 are obtained as functions of the kondo exchange interaction constant , @xmath5 . in most of the cerium compounds , the magnetic ordering temperatures , @xmath9 or @xmath10 , are rather low , typically of order 5 to 10 k. with increasing pressure ( i.e. with increasing @xmath5 ) ordering temperatures pass through a maximum and then tend to zero at the quantum critical point , above which the systems are non magnetic heavy fermion ones .    the situation in actinide compounds is more complex , and it is now established that some of them exhibit a coexistence of magnetic order and kondo effect . indeed , this phenomenon was observed in several uranium compounds , like ute,@xcite ucu@xmath12sb@xmath13,@xcite or uco@xmath14sb@xmath13@xcite in which a ferromagnetic order with large curie temperatures ( equal , respectively , to @xmath15 k , 113 k and 64.5 k ) and a logarithmic kondo - type decrease of the resistivity above @xmath10 has been experimentally detected . a similar behavior has been observed in the neptunium compounds ,",
    "npnisi@xmath13 @xcite and np@xmath13pdga@xmath16,@xcite with curie temperatures equal to , respectively , @xmath1751.5 k and 62.5 k.    the origin of this fundamentally different behaviors lies in the fact that 5@xmath0-electrons are generally less localized than the 4@xmath0-electrons and have tendency to partial delocalization . in the latter case ,",
    "5@xmath0-electrons have dual , localized and delocalized , nature which leads to reduction of magnetic moments .",
    "both phenomena have been experimentally detected .",
    "for example , magnetic moments observed in ute are substantially smaller than the free - ion values for either the @xmath1 or the @xmath18 configurations .",
    "@xcite on the same side , in the series of uranium monochalcogenides , us lies closest to the itinerant side for the @xmath4-electrons , use is in the middle and the @xmath4-electrons are more localized in ute , as evidenced by magnetization measurements.@xcite moreover , the curie temperature of ute is passing through a maximum and is then decreasing with applied pressure , which is interpreted as a weak delocalization of the @xmath4-electrons under pressure.@xcite the dual nature of the @xmath4-electrons , assuming two localized @xmath4-electrons and one delocalized electron , has been also studied by zwicknagl _",
    "@xcite who have accounted , by using band calculations , for the mass enhancement factor experimentally observed in some uranium compounds .",
    "another important difference between magnetic cerium and uranium compounds lies in the value of the @xmath4-electron spins @xmath19 which is always larger than 1/2 in uranium systems ( to avoid any confusion , in the following @xmath19 designs always the spin of the @xmath0-localized electrons and @xmath20 the spin of the conduction electrons ) . for spins @xmath19 larger than 1/2",
    ", kondo effect is more complex and depends on the number of screening channels : the underscreened kondo impurity problem and more generally the multichannel impurity problem have been studied extensively @xcite and solved exactly by the bethe ansatz method .",
    "@xcite it has been clearly established that the large spin @xmath19 of the @xmath0-electrons can be completely screened at @xmath21 by spins of conduction electrons only if the number of screening channels @xmath22 is equal to @xmath23 . if this is not the case , the problem is more complicated as shown by nozieres and blandin .",
    "@xcite    here we are interested by the case of the underscreened kondo effect , which occurs when @xmath22 is smaller than @xmath23 ; in this case , in contrast to the regular kondo impurity case , the spin is only partially screened at low temperatures , and this leads to a reduced effective spin @xmath24 . for a spin @xmath2 , this happens if there is only one active screening channel , i.e. , when only one conduction band is present near the fermi level .",
    "indeed , for the systems studied here , this is an oversimplification : generally all screening channels are not equivalent , thus , it is natural to consider that only one channel is coupled more strongly to the local spin .",
    "this channel will dominate the behavior , but other screening channels might play a role at lower temperatures , resulting in a two - stage kondo screening with two kondo temperatures.@xcite very recently , the underscreened impurity problem has been widely discussed in relation with experiments performed on quantum dots coupled to ferromagnetic leads,@xcite and in molecular quantum dots ( so called molecular transistors).@xcite    in a concentrated kondo system , these reduced effective spins @xmath25 interact ferro- or antiferromagnetically through rkky exchange interaction , leading to magnetic ordering of the reduced moments .",
    "thus coexistence of magnetic ordering and kondo effect is expected to occur more easily in the underscreened case than in the standard @xmath26 kondo lattice .",
    "the first attempt to describe the coexistence of ferromagnetism and kondo effect in uranium compounds has been performed with the help of an underscreened kondo lattice ( ukl ) model which considered localized @xmath0-spins @xmath19=1 to describe a 5@xmath27 configuration of uranium ions.@xcite this model describes the kondo interaction , @xmath5 , between localized @xmath19=1 spins and @xmath3 spins of conduction electrons , and an inter - site ferromagnetic exchange interaction between the @xmath0-spins , @xmath6 .",
    "the mean - field treatment of the ukl model gives an analog of the doniach phase diagram , and qualitatively accounts for the coexistence of ferromagnetism and kondo effect .",
    "however , this model is based on the assumption of localized 5@xmath0-electrons .",
    "of course , this assumption makes a constraint on systems which can be described by the ukl , because , as we already discussed , many metallic actinides do not have fully localized electrons . to improve the model for these compounds",
    ", one needs to include in the ukl a possibility for 5@xmath0-electron delocalization .",
    "this is the main goal of the present study .",
    "the article is organized as follows : we start by considering , in section [ sec : sw ] , the underscreened anderson lattice ( ual ) model , in which the charge transfer is present from the beginning , and we transform it by using the schrieffer - wolff transformation@xcite for @xmath28 , which allows for an effective @xmath0-band term , in addition to the exchange kondo interaction between the @xmath2 @xmath0-spins and the @xmath3 spins of the conduction electrons . then , in section [ sec : mf ] we present the mean field treatment of the model and in section [ sec : rc ] we compute the curie and kondo temperatures as a function of the different parameters and in particular of the @xmath0-bandwidth .",
    "we obtain new phase diagrams which could account for the pressure dependence of uranium systems such as ute compound .",
    "the standard model to describe the physics of the heavy fermion compounds is the periodic anderson lattice model whose hamiltonian can be written as :    @xmath29    the first term describes a conduction @xmath30-electron band :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 creates a conduction quasiparticle with spin @xmath33 and momentum @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the energy of conduction electrons .",
    "the term @xmath36 includes all local energy terms of the @xmath0-electrons and it is given by :    @xmath37~ , \\ ] ]    where @xmath38 is the energy of the two - fold degenerate @xmath0-level and @xmath39 is the number operator for @xmath0-electrons on lattice site @xmath40 , orbital @xmath41 and spin @xmath33 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the coulomb repulsions among electrons in the same and in the different orbitals , respectively , and @xmath44 is the hund s coupling constant . for @xmath45 electrons per site ,",
    "the ground state of @xmath36 is the triplet state with @xmath2 .",
    "we assume here that this triplet state is much lower in energy than the singlet states .",
    "this is achieved if @xmath46 is much smaller than @xmath47 and than @xmath42 .",
    "we study the sw transformation in this limit , assuming that 2 electrons on the same site can only be coupled in the @xmath2 state . both subsystems , localized @xmath0-electrons and conduction band , are coupled via a hybridization term ,    @xmath48    where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are creation and annihilation operators for @xmath0-electrons , carrying spin and orbital indexes , @xmath33 and @xmath51 , respectively .    in the schrieffer - wolff transformation ,",
    "the @xmath52 hybridization term is eliminated by a canonical transformation .",
    "thus , using the classical method explained in ref .",
    ", we start the procedure by writing the hamiltonian as :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 .",
    "then , we look at the scattering of an initial state @xmath55 to a final state @xmath56 , through an intermediate state @xmath57 , where the states @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are eigenstates of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are their eigenvalues , respectively .",
    "the sw transformation consists in replacing the @xmath62 term of the hamiltonian by an effective interaction which is of second order in the hybridization parameter @xmath63 of the starting hamiltonian @xmath62 .",
    "the detailed description of the calculations can be found in ref . and .",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian is given by :    @xmath64    where :    @xmath65    the sw transformation has been initially performed for the case of one @xmath8-electron in the @xmath66 configuration . here , we will present a derivation of the sw transformation in the case of a @xmath1 configuration , corresponding to a @xmath0-spin @xmath2 , and to the so - called `` underscreened kondo lattice '' model where the @xmath2 spins are coupled to a non - degenerate conduction band .",
    "we study the sw transformation for 2 @xmath0-electrons per site and allowing fluctuations of the number of @xmath0-electrons between 1 and 2 .",
    "several interactions are generated by the sw transformation.@xcite below we present the derivation of the most relevant terms , leading to both local and intersite effective interactions , namely the kondo interaction and the effective hopping of @xmath0-electrons .",
    "first , we derive the @xmath67 exchange hamiltonian for @xmath2 localized @xmath0-spins .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates of @xmath58 are , therefore , given by :    @xmath68    and the corresponding eigenvalues are    @xmath69    the sw transformation leads to the standard kondo - like @xmath67 exchange hamiltonian , but here with @xmath0-spins @xmath2 , and it is given by :    @xmath70\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the different components of the spin @xmath2 read :    @xmath71    and the corresponding exchange integral is :    @xmath72    this exchange integral @xmath73 can be easily simplified , because @xmath35 can be restricted to values very close to the fermi energy .",
    "then , the difference between @xmath34 and @xmath74 can be neglected in both the values of @xmath35 and of @xmath75 .",
    "we also assume that the mixing parameter does not depend on the orbital index @xmath41 .",
    "thus , @xmath73 can be approximated in the following by :    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the fermi level and @xmath78 is the value of @xmath63 at the fermi level .",
    "gives the definition of the kondo exchange interaction , @xmath5 that we will use in the following .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that the kondo effect is large when the energy @xmath79 is very close to the fermi energy .",
    "in fact the denominator in eq . is the energy difference between the ground state energy @xmath80 of two @xmath0-electrons in @xmath55 and @xmath56 states and the energy of the intermediate state @xmath57 with one @xmath0-electron : @xmath81 .      among the different terms emerging from the sw transformation we consider in detail those that correspond to a non - local interaction involving 2 different sites @xmath40 and @xmath82 . in this case , the relevant initial and final states @xmath55 and @xmath56 are two - sites states with a total occupation of three @xmath0-electrons , allowing charge fluctuations between sites @xmath40 and @xmath82 .",
    "consequently , an effective @xmath0 bandwidth is obtained in the @xmath83 order in @xmath84 .",
    "thus , we derive an effective band hamiltonian , @xmath85 , as the sum of three terms which arise from the schrieffer - wolff transformation and where the sum over @xmath40 and @xmath82 refers to different sites :    @xmath86    where :    @xmath87    @xmath88    @xmath89    these three terms can be simplified in the mean field approximation by introducing average occupation numbers @xmath90 . for simplicity , we will neglect all interorbital transfer terms . with these assumptions , we can see that the @xmath85 terms can be considered as effective @xmath0-hopping terms between @xmath40 and @xmath82 sites with a spin dependent hopping ( see next section ) .",
    "if the @xmath34 dependence of @xmath84 is neglected , as is often assumed , one can deduce from eqs .",
    ", and that there is no intersite hopping .",
    "thus , the @xmath34 dependence of @xmath84 is at the origin of the effective @xmath0-bandwidth and has to be taken into account .",
    "this @xmath34 dependence is due to non - local hybridization between @xmath0 and @xmath30 electrons , which has no influence on the kondo interaction , but has to be taken into account for intersite interactions . in the following we write the coefficient which enters in the expression of @xmath85 as :    @xmath91    where the function @xmath92 includes the @xmath34-dependence of @xmath93 , while the @xmath94-dependence of @xmath35 is not essential here , but could be also included .    finally , the resulting transformed hamiltonian contains two terms : @xmath95 , that gives the kondo exchange interaction for spin @xmath2 and the important and new term @xmath85 , which can be considered as an effective band term for the @xmath4-electrons .",
    "thus , in addition to the kondo interaction , we have derived here a term which leads to a finite @xmath0-bandwidth ; this newly introduced term will be shown as giving a better description of uranium and actinide compounds where the @xmath4-electrons are less localized than the @xmath8-electrons in rare earth compounds .    besides this effective band term , there are other intersite interactions which lead to rkky exchange , but they arise only to @xmath96 order in hybridization @xmath84 .",
    "we do not compute all these terms , but , instead , we will introduce them phenomenologically as an additional intersite exchange parameter of the model , @xmath6 .",
    "combining all terms obtained in the preceding section , we can write the new effective hamiltonian as :    @xmath97    the heisenberg interaction @xmath6 is considered here as a ferromagnetic exchange between nearest neighbors only . in fact",
    "rkky interactions are long range and oscillating , but since our aim is to study the coexistence of ferromagnetism and kondo effect , we consider only ferromagnetic interactions . the mean field approach has been previously described in ref . .",
    "for the kondo part @xmath95 , it is based on a generalization of a functional integration approach described by yoshimori and sakurai for the single impurity case @xcite and by lacroix and cyrot for the @xmath26 kondo lattice case.@xcite    here we introduce the following mean field parameters : the average occupation numbers @xmath90 , @xmath98 and the `` kondo '' parameter @xmath99 . we restrict ourselves to uniform solutions in which all these quantities are site and orbital independent , i.e. , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "thus , @xmath85 can be written as :    @xmath103    the effective band dispersion depends on spin but not on the orbital indexes . then :    @xmath104    with @xmath105~ , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and where @xmath92 is the dispersion relation for the @xmath0-band .",
    "we assume , for simplicity , that the @xmath0-band dispersion is similar to the conduction electron dispersion , i. e. , @xmath106 .",
    "we also assume that the @xmath0-band should be narrower than the conduction band , so @xmath107 .",
    "parameter @xmath108 can be included in the local energy @xmath38 , and @xmath109 is a multiplicative coefficient that can be absorbed in the definition of @xmath110 .",

    "we define the kondo temperature as the temperature where @xmath135 and @xmath147 vanish .",
    "the fact that the kondo parameter vanishes at a particular temperature is a well known artefact of the mean field approximation .",

    "3a,3b and 3c are obtained for three different characterizations of the f - bandwidth , cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "we notice that the temperatures @xmath11 and @xmath10 are obtained as the temperatures at which the mean field parameters ( @xmath0 and @xmath30 magnetizations and the kondo parameters @xmath152 ) vanish . in the three cases we note",
    "that the kondo temperature @xmath11 becomes non - zero only above a critical value @xmath153 which varies from case to case . in all cases ,",
    "once non - zero , the kondo temperature rapidly increases for larger values of @xmath5 .",
    "the curie temperature , @xmath10 , is non - zero above a given @xmath5 value in case ( a ) , below a given @xmath5 value for case ( b ) and is non - zero for all studied values of @xmath5 for case ( c ) .",
    "the reason for these different behaviors is easy to understand . in case",
    "a ) the f - bandwidth is constant and the system needs a finite value of @xmath5 to get magnetic ordering because f - electrons are itinerant even at small @xmath5 . in case",
    "b ) the f - bandwidth increases linearly with @xmath5 , so , for low values of @xmath5 the f - electrons are localized and they are magnetic even for @xmath154 ; thus as soon as @xmath5 is different from zero , magnetic ordering occurs .",
    "when increasing @xmath5 the f - bandwidth also increases , and magnetism is destroyed because of the itinerant character of the f - electrons .",
    "finally in case c ) the f - bandwidth depends on both @xmath5 and magnetization , and the dependence is different for up and down spin electrons;it can be seen on figure 3 that this complex dependence of the bandwidth leads to small variation of the curie temperature , with a weak maximum .",
    "however a crossing point , at which @xmath10 and @xmath11 are equal is obtained in all cases .    concerning the kondo effect , in all cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c )",
    "a peculiar behavior has been obtained for values of @xmath5 just above this crossing point : at the temperature @xmath155 indicated on fig .",

    "[ fig4 ] , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath135 for @xmath115 , @xmath114 but for values of @xmath5 near the crossing of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath156 for case ( a ) , @xmath157 for case ( b ) and @xmath158 for case ( c ) .",
    "it appears clearly that , with decreasing temperature , the kondo effect occurs first , then there is a coexistence of kondo effect and ferromagnetism , and finally the kondo effect disappears to yield only a strong ferromagnetism at extremely low temperatures .",
    "this behavior can be interpreted in the following way : kondo effect for a spin @xmath2 can not be complete , as explained in the introduction .",
    "thus if exchange is large enough , the ordering of the remaining @xmath0-moments occurs in the kondo phase .",
    "however , at lower temperature , when these magnetic moments are large , they act as an internal magnetic field that destroys the kondo effect .",
    "it should be pointed out that there is at present no experimental evidence in favor or in contrast of such an effect in actinide compounds at very low temperature .",
    "another interesting result that can be pointed out is the decrease of the curie temperature for large @xmath5 above the intersection point particularly in case ( b ) , but also within a small range of value of @xmath5 in case ( c ) .",
    "this decrease can probably be considered as resulting from the `` delocalization '' of the 5@xmath0-electrons .",
    "let us also remark that @xmath5 increases with increasing pressure and that the two figs .",
    "[ figtctk]b ) and [ figtctk]c ) can give a description of the experimentally observed variation of @xmath10 with pressure in ute compound , which is passing through a maximum and then decreasing with applied pressure.@xcite    to summarize our paper , the present work improves the previous @xmath2 ukl model of ref . by explicitly including the effect of a weak delocalization of the @xmath4-electrons .",
    "within this improved model , we have obtained new phenomena in the region where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are of the same order of magnitude : a possible disappearance of the kondo effect at low temperature , which is a direct consequence of the underscreened kondo effect , and a maximum of @xmath10 as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "it is worth to note that , in our model , the delocalization of the @xmath4-electrons increases when @xmath5 increases , i.e. when pressure is applied ; then the magnetization decreases and in the same way the curie temperature .",
    "therefore , the change in the curie temperature at large @xmath5 is more influenced by delocalization than by competition between magnetism and kondo effect .",
    "this is a different result compared with the case of cerium compounds , where the magnetization is destroyed by kondo effect , i.e. by the screening of the magnetic moment . in the underscreened @xmath2 kondo lattice , because kondo screening can never be complete , the kondo effect alone does not destroy ferromagnetism .    to conclude",

    "the first effect works against magnetism , while the second one favors magnetism .",
    "the competition between these two effects leads to complex phase diagrams which can improve the description of some actinide compounds and explain in particular the maximum of @xmath10 observed experimentally in ute compound with increasing pressure ."

    "<S> magnetic properties of uranium and neptunium compounds showing the coexistence of kondo screening effect and ferromagnetic order are investigated within the anderson lattice hamiltonian with a two - fold degenerate @xmath0-level in each site , corresponding to @xmath1 electronic configuration with @xmath2 spins . </S>",
    "<S> a derivation of the schrieffer - wolff transformation is presented and the resulting hamiltonian has an effective @xmath0-band term , in addition to the regular exchange kondo interaction between the @xmath2 @xmath0-spins and the @xmath3 spins of the conduction electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained effective kondo lattice model can describe both the kondo regime and a weak delocalization of @xmath4-electron . within this model </S>",
    "<S> we compute the kondo and curie temperatures as a function of model parameters , namely the kondo exchange interaction constant @xmath5 , the magnetic intersite exchange interaction @xmath6 and the effective @xmath0-bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> we deduce , therefore , a phase diagram of the model which yields the coexistence of kondo effect and ferromagnetic ordering and also accounts for the pressure dependence of the curie temperature of uranium compounds such as ute . </S>"
