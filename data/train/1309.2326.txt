    "the * platonic solids *  the convex polyhedra with equivalent faces composed of congruent convex regular polygons  have been known and studied by mathematicians and philosophers alike for millennia .",
    "more broadly , another class of convex polyhedra which are also well - known to mathematicians are the * archimedean solids * : the semi - regular convex polyhedra composed of two or more types of regular polygons meeting in identical vertices , with no requirement that faces be equivalent . there are three categories of such archimedean solids : ( i ) the platonic solids ; ( ii ) two infinite series solutions - the prisms and anti - prisms ; and ( iii ) fourteen further exceptional cases .    in @xcite , a novel approach to the archimedean solids was taken by interpreting the graphs of these solids as clean * dessins denfants * in the sense of grothendieck .",
    "we recall that a dessin is a bipartite graph drawn on a riemann surface and that _",
    "clean _ is the criterion that all the nodes of one of the two possible colours have valency two @xcite .",
    "the underlying riemann surface we will choose throughout will be simply the sphere @xmath1 onto which we can embed the solids ; furthermore , we will draw them in a planar projection .",
    "now , the planar graph of any polytope can be interpreted as a clean dessin by inserting a black node into every edge of the graph , and colouring every vertex white . given any such clean dessin",
    ", one can extract a remarkable array of group theoretic and algebraic properties .",
    "indeed , the motivation of @xcite was to investigate some of these properties for the interesting class of highly symmetric dessins which correspond to the archimedean solids .    in a parallel vein ,",
    "trivalent clean dessins can be naturally associated to conjugacy classes of subgroups of the modular group in a manner we will soon describe ; this further extends to a correspondence with k3 surfaces @xcite and to gauge theories @xcite .",
    "this paper constitutes an codification of the above directions into a unified outlook . while @xcite focused on finding the * belyi maps * corresponding to each of the dessins for the archimedean solids , here we shall approach these dessins from the group - theoretic angle discussed in @xcite , by considering their connections to subgroups of the famous * modular group * , and a more general class of groups known as * hecke groups*. recall that the modular group @xmath2 is the group of linear fractional transformations @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the presentation of @xmath6 is @xmath7 .",
    "a natural generalisation is to consider groups with presentation @xmath8 : such groups , which we shall denote @xmath9 , are the hecke groups .",
    "clearly , @xmath10 is the modular group .    with this in mind",
    ", every clean dessin denfant can be associated to the conjugacy class of a subgroup of a certain hecke group , or free product of hecke groups , in the following way : black nodes are associated with elements of the cyclic group @xmath11 , while @xmath12-valent white nodes are associated with elements of the cyclic group @xmath13 . for a dessin with white nodes with multiple valencies ,",
    "the different valency white nodes are associated with the different @xmath14 , so that a clean dessin with white nodes of a single valency is associated with a conjugacy class of subgroups of a certain hecke group , while a clean dessin with white nodes of multiple valencies is associated with a conjugacy class of subgroup of a group that is isomorphic to the free product of the relevant hecke groups .",
    "this association made , each dessin can be interpreted as the * schreier coset graph * of the corresponding hecke group @xcite , which is the cayley graph of the hecke group quotiented by some finite index subgroup . from this coset graph , the permutation representation for the associated conjugacy class of subgroups can be extracted . in this paper",
    ", we shall use these data to compute the generators for a representative of the conjugacy class of hecke subgroups corresponding to each of the exceptional archimedean solids as explicit @xmath15 matrices .",
    "once we have obtained these results , we shall moreover investigate whether any of these subgroups are so - called _ congruence _ subgroups .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , in section 2 we present some technical details regarding hecke groups and dessins denfants .",
    "we show that it is possible to interpret each clean dessin as the schreier coset graph for a conjugacy class of subgroups of a certain hecke group , or free product of hecke groups .",
    "we then show that the belyi map associated to the particular clean dessin in question is the map from the generalisation of the * modular curve * associated to each conjugacy class of subgroups of a hecke group in question to @xmath16 . in section 3",
    ", we find the permutations for the conjugacy classes of subgroups of hecke groups corresponding to every archimedean solid , and provide explicit generating sets of matrices for representatives of those conjugacy classes of subgroups in the exceptional cases . finally",
    ", we remark on the congruence properties of these subgroups .",
    "in this section , we first recall some essential details regarding both hecke groups and clean dessins denfants . we begin by considering the modular group @xmath17 , as although this is isomorphic to only one particular hecke group , it is by far the most well - studied , and we shall draw upon the presented results at many points in the ensuing discussion . subsequently , we discuss hecke groups more generally , before moving on to consider clean dessins and their associated belyi maps .    with these well - known results in hand ,",
    "we then describe how every such clean dessin is isomorphic to the schreier coset graph for a certain conjugacy class of subgroups of a hecke group , or free product of hecke groups ( henceforth we may refer to such conjugacy classes as _ classes of hecke subgroups _ ; where there is no ambiguity we may use @xmath18 to denote such classes ) .",
    "we then take a short digression in order to resolve some tangential questions regarding the construction of these schreier coset graphs which have yet to be presented explicitly in the literature .",
    "next , we describe the connection between the belyi maps associated to the clean dessins in question and the algebraic curves corresponding to precisely the same classes of hecke subgroups as arose in the discussion of coset graphs .      to begin our discussion , we recall some essential details regarding the modular group @xmath6 .",
    "this is the group of linear fractional transformations @xmath19 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "it is generated by the transformations @xmath20 and @xmath21 defined by : @xmath22 the presentation of @xmath6 is @xmath23 , and we will later discuss the presentations of certain modular subgroups .",
    "the @xmath24 matrices for @xmath21 and @xmath20 are as follows : @xmath25    letting @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the elements of order 2 and 3 respectively , we see that @xmath6 is the free product of the cyclic groups @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it follows that @xmath24 matrices for @xmath30 and @xmath31 are : @xmath32    with these basic details in hand , we should consider some notable subgroups of @xmath6 .",
    "the most important subgroups of @xmath6 are the so - called _ congruence _ subgroups , defined by having the the entries in the generating matrices @xmath21 and @xmath20 obeying some modular arithmetic .",
    "some conjugacy classes of congruence subgroups of particular note are the following :    * principal congruence subgroups : @xmath33 * congruence subgroups of level @xmath34 : subgroups of @xmath6 containing @xmath35 but not any @xmath36 for @xmath37 ; * unipotent matrices : @xmath38 * upper triangular matrices : @xmath39 * the congruence subgroups @xmath40 for certain choices of @xmath34 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "we note here that : @xmath44    in section 3 of this paper , we shall remark on the connections between some specific conjugacy classes of congruence modular subgroups and the archimedean solids .      we can now extend our discussion of the modular group @xmath17 to the more general hecke groups @xmath9 .",
    "the hecke group @xmath9 has presentation @xmath8 , and is thus the free product of cyclic groups @xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath9 is generated by transformations @xmath20 and @xmath21 now defined by : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is some real number to be determined .",

    "explicitly places a constraint which allows for a solution of @xmath51 , we find that the following general expression , as well as some important values for small @xmath12 : @xmath52 in particular , @xmath51 are algebraic numbers .      by way of extension of the above discussion of subgroups of the modular group @xmath6 , it is useful to consider congruence subgroups of hecke groups . as stated in @xcite ,",
    "the hecke groups are discrete subgroups of @xmath53 ; in fact , the matrix entries are in @xmath54 $ ] , the extension of the ring of integers by the algebraic number @xmath46 .",

    "a * dessin denfant * in the sense of grothendieck is an ordered pair @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is an oriented compact topological surface and @xmath68 is a finite graph * * satisfying the following conditions",
    "@xcite :    1 .",
    "@xmath69 is connected .",
    "2 .   @xmath69 is _ bipartite _ , i.e. consists of only black and white nodes , such that vertices connected by an edge have different colours .",
    "@xmath70 is the union of finitely many topological discs , which we call the _",
    "faces_.    we can interpret any polytope as a dessin by inserting a black node into every edge , and colouring all vertices white .",
    "this process of inserting into each edge a bivalent node of a certain colour is standard in the study of dessins denfants and gives rise to so - called _ clean _ dessins , i.e. , those for which all the nodes of one of the two possible colours have valency two .",
    "an example of this procedure for the cube is shown in figure [ f : dessineg ] .",
    "now recall that there is a one - to - one correspondence between dessins denfants and * belyi maps * @xcite .",
    "a belyi map is a holomorphic map to @xmath16 ramified at only @xmath71 , i.e.",
    "for which the only points @xmath72 where @xmath73 are such that @xmath74 . we can associate a belyi map @xmath75 to a dessin via its _ ramification indices _ : the order of vanishing of the taylor series for @xmath75 at @xmath72 is the ramification index @xmath76 at that @xmath77th ramification point @xcite . to draw the dessin from the map , we mark one white node for the @xmath77th pre - image of 0 , with @xmath78 edges emanating therefrom ; similarly , we mark one black node for the @xmath79th pre - image of 1 , with @xmath80 edges .",
    "we connect the nodes with the edges , joining only black with white , such that each face is a polygon with @xmath81 sides @xcite .",
    "the converse direction ( from dessins to belyi maps ) is detailed in e.g. @xcite .",
    "as already discussed , the hecke group @xmath9 has presentation @xmath8 , and is thus the free product of cyclic groups @xmath11 and @xmath13 . given the free product structure of @xmath9 , we see that its cayley graph is an infinite free @xmath12-valent tree , but with each node replaced by an oriented @xmath12-gon . now , for any _ finite index _",
    "subgroup @xmath82 of @xmath9 , we can quotient the cayley graph to arrive at a finite graph by associating nodes to right cosets and edges between cosets which are related by action of a group element .",
    "in other words , this graph encodes the permutation representation of @xmath9 acting on the right cosets of @xmath82 .",
    "this is called a * schreier coset graph * , sometimes also referred to in the literature as a _ schreier - cayley coset graph _ , or simply a _",
    "coset graph_.    there is a direct connection between the schreier coset graphs and the dessins denfants for each class of hecke subgroups @xcite :    the dessins denfants for a certain conjugacy class of subgroups of a hecke group @xmath9 can be constructed from the schreier coset graphs by replacing each positively oriented @xmath12-gon with a white node , and inserting a black node into every edge .",
    "conversely , the schreier coset graphs can be constructed from the dessins by replacing each white node with a positively oriented @xmath12-gon , and removing the black node from every edge .",
    "let @xmath83 and @xmath84 denote the permutations induced by the respective actions of @xmath30 and @xmath31 on the cosets of each subgroup . we can find a third permutation @xmath85 by imposing the following condition , thereby constructing a * permutation triple * : @xmath86    the permutations @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 give the * permutation representations * of @xmath9 on the right cosets of each subgroup in question . as elements of the symmetric group , @xmath83 and @xmath84",
    "can be easily computed from the schreier coset graphs by following the procedure elaborated in @xcite , i.e. , by noting that the doubly directed edges represent an element @xmath30 of order 2 , while the positively oriented triangles represent an element @xmath31 of order @xmath12 .",
    "since the graphs are connected , the group generated by @xmath30 and @xmath31 is transitive on the vertices .",
    "clearly , @xmath83 and @xmath84 tell us which vertex of the coset graph is sent to which , i.e. which coset of the modular subgroup in question is sent to which by the action of @xmath9 on the right cosets of this subgroup .",
    "consider now a clean dessin denfant with white nodes with @xmath34 different valencies ( in the above , we assumed that all the white nodes of the dessin had the same valency ) .",
    "it is still possible to interpret this dessin as a schreier coset graph , though in this case the coset graph will correspond to a conjugacy class of subgroups of a group isomorphic to the free product of cyclic groups @xmath87 , where the @xmath88 denote the different valencies of the white nodes of the dessin . since , to recall , @xmath89",
    ", we see that dessins with _",
    "multiple _ white node valencies correspond to conjugacy classes of subgroups of free products of hecke groups .      as detailed above ,",
    "schreier coset graphs are built from simple edges @xmath90 and @xmath12-gons @xmath91 which are assumed to be positively oriented . reversal of @xmath12-gon orientation corresponds to applying the automorphism of @xmath9 that inverts each of the two generators @xmath30 and @xmath31 . at this point",
    "though , it is worth answering an intriguing tangential question : to what conjugacy classes of subgroups do the coset graphs correspond when _ arbitrary _ @xmath12-gons are reversed in orientation ?    to answer this question , first consider the schreier coset graphs for the conjugacy classes of congruence subgroups of the modular group @xmath92 and @xmath93 , as shown in figure [ f : flip ] ( these coset graphs were originally presented in @xcite ; the associated dessins denfants are drawn in @xcite ) .",
    "blue lines correspond to permutations @xmath83 generated by @xmath30 , while red triangles correspond to permutations @xmath84 generated by @xmath31 , and we assume initially that all such triangles are positively oriented . as stated in @xcite ,",
    "these two coset graphs are not isomorphic , as they have different circuits .",
    "+         +    what happens if we swap the orientation of an arbitrary triangle in one of these coset graphs ?",
    "for example , what happens if we choose the third - from - left triangle in the coset graph for @xmath92 to be _ negatively _ oriented rather than positively oriented ?",
    "such a modified coset graph is drawn in figure [ f : gamma0 - 8 ] .        to answer this question",
    ", we read the relevant permutations off of the original and altered coset graph . in the original case ,",
    "the corresponding conjugacy class of modular subgroups @xmath92 is generated by the permutations : @xmath94    in the second , altered case , the corresponding conjugacy class of modular subgroups is that generated by the permutations : @xmath95    note that the triple @xmath96 has changed to @xmath97 : this is the only change .",
    "now , at this point we can use the @xcite algorithm presented in section 3.2 of @xcite to compute a generating set of matrices for a representative of the conjugacy class of subgroups corresponding to our original and modified coset graphs , taking the above permutations as input .",
    "of course , we would need to modify the algorithm in order to study classes of hecke subgroups more generally ; we present this modified code explicitly in the appendix . in the original case ,",
    "such a generating set is : @xmath98    from the definition of @xmath99 , we see that these are generators for a representative of the conjugacy class of congruence subgroups @xmath100 , as expected . in the modified case ,",
    "a generating set is given by : @xmath101    brief reflection on these matrices suffices to make apparent that these are generators of a representative of the conjugacy class of congruence subgroups @xmath93 . by reversing the orientation of the chosen triangle in the coset graph for @xmath100 , we have obtained the permutations for @xmath93 .",
    "hence , this modified coset graph no longer corresponds to @xmath100 , but rather to @xmath93 .",
    "the reasons for this are easily stated in general terms : swapping @xmath12-gon orientations in schreier coset graphs changes the permutations defining the associated conjugacy class of subgroups of the relevant hecke group .",
    "these permutations need not define the same conjugacy class of subgroups as the original permutations .",
    "in fact , in general they will _ not _ , and will instead define the subgroup whose schreier coset graph with all _ positively _ oriented @xmath12-gons has the same cycles as the modified coset graph , with arbitrary @xmath12-gon orientations .",
    "this final point is nicely viewed in geometrical terms for our specific example : by choosing the third - from - left triangle in the coset graph for @xmath100 to be negatively oriented , we obtain a coset graph which has the same cycles as that for @xmath93 when all the triangles are chosen to be positively oriented .",
    "let @xmath102 be prime and let @xmath103 be the subgroup of matrices congruent to ( plus or minus ) the identity modulo @xmath102 .",
    "then @xmath104 acts on the completed upper half - plane @xmath105 , and the quotient @xmath106 can be given the structure of a riemann surface , known as a * modular curve*. defining the subgroup @xmath107 , the @xmath79-map @xmath108 is a galois cover ramified ( with suitable normalisation ) at @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath79 is a belyi map from @xmath109 to @xmath16 associated to a dessin drawn on the riemann surface @xmath109 .",
    "generalising now from @xmath17 to all hecke groups @xmath9 , we first note that , as detailed in @xcite , the quotient space @xmath110 is a sphere with one puncture and two elliptic fixed points of order 2 and @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , all hecke groups @xmath9 can be considered as triangle groups , and the hecke surface @xmath110 is a riemann surface @xcite . clearly , we are interested in the class of algebraic curves defined in analogy to the modular curve above , with the property that there exists a hecke subgroup @xmath111 such that the map @xmath112 is a galois cover ramified at @xmath71 .    with this in mind ,",
    "let @xmath67 be a compact riemann surface which admits a regular tessellation by hyperbolic @xmath12-gons .",
    "such a surface admits reconstruction from a torsion - free subgroup @xmath82 of finite index in a hecke group @xmath9 in the following way . the compact surface @xmath113 obtained from the group @xmath82 has finitely many _",
    "cusps _ added to the surface @xmath114 , one for each @xmath82-orbit of boundary points at which the stabiliser is non - trivial .",
    "the holomorphic projection @xmath115 induced from the identity map on the universal covering extends to a belyi map @xmath116 from the compactification , with each cusp of @xmath67 mapped by @xmath117 to the single cusp @xmath118 of @xmath9 , which compactifies @xcite the plane @xmath110 to @xmath119 .",
    "the connection to dessins is then as follows : choose any particular clean dessin denfant .",
    "we have already described how this dessin can be interpreted as a schreier coset graph for a particular hecke group @xmath9 ( or free product of hecke groups ) .",
    "in addition though , the above results demonstrate that the belyi rational map associated to the dessin is precisely the map @xmath120 , with each cusp of @xmath67 mapped by @xmath117 to the single cusp @xmath118 of @xmath9 .",
    "with the results of the previous section in hand , we can proceed to apply the theory to the so - called _ archimedean solids_. in this section , we first give a technical definition of these geometrical entities .",
    "we then identify the hecke group for which each of the archimedean solids has a corresponding conjugacy class of subgroups , before giving the permutation representations @xmath83 and @xmath84 for each corresponding class .",
    "we then ( in every case where possible ) find a representative of these classes of subgroups associated to each archimedean solid by specifying a generating set for that representative , following the procedure in @xcite .",
    "finally , we follow up some residual questions from @xcite , investigating whether the trivalent archimedean solids , when interpreted as dessins denfants , correspond in general to conjugacy classes of _ congruence _ subgroups of the modular group @xmath6 .",
    "the platonic solids are well - known to us , and are the regular , convex polyhedra .",
    "they are the tetrahedron , cube , octahedron , dodecahedron and icosahedron . in order to introduce the wider class of",
    "so - called _ archimedean solids _ , consider planar graphs without loops , and with vertices of degree @xmath121 .",
    "following @xcite , let us call the list of numbers @xmath122 , where the @xmath123 are the number of edges of the adjacent faces taken in the counter - clockwise direction around the vertex , the _ type _ of that vertex .",
    "two such lists are _ equivalent _ if one can be obtained from the other by ( a ) making a cyclic shift and ( b ) inverting the order of the @xmath123 .",
    "a solid is called * archimedean * if the types of all its vertices are equivalent @xcite .",
    "we emphasize a subtlety here .",
    "as stated in the introduction , one informal way of defining the archimedean solids is as the semi - regular convex polyhedra composed of two or more types of regular polygons meeting in identical vertices , with no requirement that faces be equivalent .",
    "_ identical vertices _ is usually taken to mean that for any two vertices , there must be an isometry of the entire solid that takes one vertex to the other .",
    "sometimes , however , it is only required that the faces that meet at one vertex are related isometrically to the faces that meet at the other . on the former definition , the so - called _ pseudorhombicuboctahedron _ , otherwise known as the _ elongated square gyrobicupola _ , is not considered an archimedean solid ; on the latter it is .",
    "the formal definition of the archimedean solids above corresponds to the second , broader definition of identical vertices ; following @xcite , it is this definition which we shall use . for a more extended discussion of this point ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .    [",

    "this task shall be undertaken in the following subsection .      can the archimedean solids all be associated with conjugacy classes of subgroups of the modular group , and are those subgroups congruence ?",
    "the answer to the first question is straightforwardly _ no _ : only the trivalent solids are such that , interpreted as dessins , they are subgroups of the modular group , which is isomorphic to the free product of cyclic groups @xmath127 and @xmath128 , as detailed above . hence , only those archimedean solids labelled ` yes ' in the column ` trivalent ? ' of table [ archtable ] can be associated with subgroups of the modular group .",

    "this is to be expected : we already know that the truncated tetrahedron corresponds to the congruence subgroup @xmath169 @xcite",
    ".      permutations @xmath83 and @xmath84 for this dessin corresponding to the 3-prism , obtained from our general formula presented in are :    @xmath171    we can now check whether the modular subgroup associated to the 3-prism is congruence by implementing the following code in :    ` sage : g2 = arithmeticsubgroup_permutation ( `   + ` s2=(1,6)(4,9)(7,3)(2,10)(5,13)(8,16)(11,15)(14,18)(17,12 ) , `   + ` s3=(1,2,3)(4,5,6)(7,8,9)(10,11,12)(13,14,15)(16,17,18 ) ) `   + ` sage : g2.is_congruence ( ) `   + ` false `    hence we see that the 3-prism is an archimedean solid whose corresponding modular subgroup is _ not _ congruence .",
    "our result for the 3-prism above demonstrates that the prisms in general do not correspond to conjugacy classes of congruence subgroups of the modular group , when interpreted as clean dessins denfants .",
    "however , we know that _ some _ prisms _ do _ correspond to conjugacy classes of congruence subgroups : we have seen that the 8-prism corresponds to the conjugacy class of subgroups @xmath170 . we hence conclude that the prisms do not _ in general _ correspond to conjugacy classes of congruence subgroups of the modular group , though there are exceptions .",
    "repeating the working presented in the examples above for the remaining trivalent , exceptional archimedean solids gives the following result :    the truncated tetrahedron is the _ only _ trivalent , exceptional archimedean solid which corresponds to a conjugacy class of congruence subgroups of the modular group .",
    "in this paper , we have elaborated the connections between clean dessins denfants and conjugacy classes of subgroups of hecke groups , or free products of hecke groups .",

    "this current work extends the connections between dessins denfants , group theory , and algebraic curves - which has previously focused largely on the modular group @xmath17 - to a much wider class of groups .",
    "when it comes to applying this theory , we have first shown how , through interpretation as clean dessins denfants , each of the archimedean solids can be associated with a conjugacy class of subgroups of hecke groups . we have explicitly computed the matrix generators of these corresponding hecke subgroups . moreover , we have presented a number of results regarding the congruence properties of these subgroups . this work is useful not only as an illustration of the connections between hecke groups and clean dessins , but also because it develops one more area of study of the archimedean solids , and extends the work in this area already carried out in @xcite .",
    "possible developments of this work abound .",
    "for example , one might be interested in establishing whether the conjugacy classes of subgroups of hecke groups for the archimedean solids which correspond to subgroups of @xmath133 and @xmath134 are congruence .",
    "no general algorithm for checking the congruence properties of a hecke group currently exists .",
    "there is , however , an algorithm for determining whether a subgroup of @xmath6 is congruence @xcite , which we have employed ( via implementation in @xcite ) in this paper . to extend this algorithm to general hecke groups",
    "is clearly an interesting task for future pursuit .    from an algebro - geometrical point of view",
    ", the subgroups of the modular group can be quotiented , upon adjoining cusps , to give modular curves which are riemann surfaces of some genus .",
    "the tetrahedron , cube and dodecahedron correspond to @xmath172 for @xmath173 , which are all genus 0 , torsion free subgroups of @xmath6 .",
    "it would be interesting to explore the geometry of all the riemann surfaces obtainable from the list of archimedean solids .",
