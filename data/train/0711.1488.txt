    "the study of high-@xmath0 superconductivity is one of the most attractive realms in the last two decades .",
    "since the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) directly probes the electronic occupied states , it has become an important technique to investigate the electronic properties of cuprates@xcite .",
    "recently , the oxygen isotope effect has been detected with arpes in bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath3 ( bi2212 ) by two groups@xcite , and a common feature is noticed that the spectra are shifted with the @xmath4o/@xmath5o substitution , providing direct evidence for electron - phonon ( @xmath2-ph ) coupling in this material . however , since the first report by gweon _",
    "et al._@xcite , this isotopic band shift has become an controversial issue@xcite , as the observed shift is up to 40 mev , much larger than the isotopic energy change of oxygen phonon , @xmath6 5 mev@xcite .",
    "very recently , douglas _",
    "et al._@xcite repeat the experiment , but find the shift is only 2@xmath73 mev .",
    "thus it turns out to be an interesting problem whether the large shift observed by gweon _",
    "et al . _ is possible or not in the cuprates . in this paper",
    "we shall look into this isotope induced band shift from a theoretical point of view .    in the cuo@xmath1 plane of cuprates , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the electronic transfer is affected by the vibration of oxygen atoms between the initial and final cu sites , resulting in an off - diagonal type @xmath2-ph coupling . in order to have an insight into the isotope effect of bi2212",
    ", we start from a half - filled hamiltonian including the electron - electron ( @xmath2-@xmath2 ) repulsion and the above mentioned off - diagonal @xmath2-ph coupling ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 throughout this paper ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath13 at the cu site @xmath14 on a square lattice ( see in fig .",
    "the electrons hop between two nearest neighboring cu sites , denoted by @xmath15 , with a transfer energy @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the strength of coulomb repulsion between two electrons on the same cu site with opposite spins .",
    "the oxygen phonon is assumed to be of the einstein type with a frequency @xmath18 and a mass @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the mass change factor of phonon due to the isotope substitution . in the third term",
    ", @xmath22 is the dimensionless coordinate operator of the oxygen phonon locating between the nearest - neighboring cu sites @xmath14 and @xmath23 , and the sum denoted by @xmath24 just means a summation over all the phonon sites in the lattice .",
    "conduction plane in cuprates .",
    "the copper atom ( white circle ) is on the @xmath14-th site of a simple square lattice .",
    "the oxygen atom ( black circle ) is located between the nearest - neighboring cu sites , and @xmath25 denotes its displacement from the equilibrium position . ]    in the conduction plane of cuo@xmath1 , the electronic hopping integral @xmath26 can be expanded to the second order terms with respect to the phonon displacements @xmath22 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the bare hopping energy and @xmath29 the off - diagonal quadratic @xmath2-ph coupling constant . here",
    "we note the linear @xmath2-ph coupling does not occur owing to the lattice symmetry of present model . whereas the inter - site @xmath2-@xmath2 interaction is included in the screened values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "in this section , we develop a path - integral theory for a model with both @xmath2-@xmath2 and @xmath2-ph interactions . by making use of the trotter s decoupling formula ,",
    "the boltzmann operator is written as , @xmath30 applying the hubbard - stratonovitch transformation@xcite and the gaussian integral formula@xcite , we decouple the two - body parts , so that the @xmath2-@xmath2 and @xmath2-ph correlated terms are replaced by a two - fold summation over the auxiliary spin and lattice configurations , which is the so - called path - integral . in this way",

    "2(a ) , we plot the ratio @xmath69 versus @xmath29 , at @xmath17=2.0 and @xmath68=10 , where @xmath70 is the band shift at the @xmath71 point of brillouin zone [ @xmath72=(0,0 ) ] , and @xmath73 is the isotopic change of phonon energy .",
    "the filled circles are calculated by qmc , and the solid curve by the mean - field theory with hartree - fork approximation ( hfa ) as a guide for eyes . here",
    "both theories figure out an increase of @xmath69 with @xmath29 , which means if the @xmath2-ph coupling is strong enough , a large band shift can be generated in the cost of a small @xmath73 . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the ratio @xmath69 versus @xmath17 are shown for three different @xmath29 s , where the discrete symbols and continuous curves are the qmc and hfa results , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that the ratio @xmath69 increases with @xmath29 . meanwhile , for a fixed @xmath29 , the ratio declines slightly as @xmath17 increases .",
    "this behavior indicates that the band shift is owing to the @xmath2-ph coupling , whereas the presence of @xmath17 partially reduces this effect . in terms of figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) , one can see the band shift is actually a measure of the @xmath2-ph coupling strength in the system .",
    "if the result of ref .",
    "[ 2 ] is correct , the @xmath2-ph coupling must be strong in bi2212 .",
    "on the contrary , ref . [ 3 ] shows that the coupling can not be very large .",
    "in summary , by using the path - integral qmc method , we study the isotopic shift in the arpes of bi2212 based on a model including both @xmath2-@xmath2 and off - diagonal quadratic @xmath2-ph interactions .",
    "our calculation demonstrates that the band shift is primarily triggered by the @xmath2-ph coupling , while the presence of @xmath2-@xmath2 repulsion tends to suppress this effect ."
