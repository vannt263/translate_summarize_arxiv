    "all spectra were rebinned using standard procedures .",
    "data were selected in the energy ranges 0.14.0  kev ( lecs ) , 1.810  kev ( mecs ) , and 15100  kev ( pds ) where the instrument responses are well determined and sufficient counts obtained .",

    "the photo - electric absorption cross sections of morrison & mccammon ( @xcite ) and the abundances of anders & grevesse ( @xcite ) are used throughout .",

    "these factors were constrained to be within their usual ranges during the fitting .",
    "all spectral uncertainties and upper - limits are given at 90% confidence .",
    "initially , simple models were tried , including absorbed power - law , thermal bremsstrahlung and cutoff power - law models , all yielding unacceptable results for the broad band spectrum .",
    "when a power - law model is used , examination of the residuals shows a curved spectrum in the energy range 210 kev and a structured soft excess below about 1 kev .",
    "several different combinations of spectral model were tried next , always including a power - law , which is required by the pds data .",
    "both a blackbody and a bremsstrahlung were added to the power - law in order to account for the curvature of the 210  kev spectrum , but always gave unacceptable results , primarily due to the structured residuals below 1  kev .",
    "an absorbed (  @xmath24 ) multicolour disk - blackbody ( the diskbb model in xspec ) ( with kt@xmath25  1.8  kev ) together with an absorbed power - law with @xmath26 gives significantly better results , but again low - energy residuals are present .",

    "( @xcite ) assumes that the gravitational energy released by the accreting material is locally dissipated into blackbody radiation , that the accretion flow is continuous throughout the disk and that the effects of electron scattering on the spectrum are negligible .",
    "there are only two parameters in the model : r@xmath27 where r@xmath28 is the innermost radius of the disk , @xmath29 the inclination angle of the disk , d@xmath30 the source distance in units of 10  kpc , and kt@xmath28 the blackbody effective temperature at r@xmath28 .",
    "the limitations of this model are discussed in merloni et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the low metallicity of the hosting globular cluster ( @xmath00.01 solar ) prompted us to try using a photoelectric absorption model with variable abundances ( vphabs in xspec ) , together with a photoelectric absorption fixed at the interstellar value of @xmath31  atom  @xmath2 .",
    "different combinations of linked abundances were tried .",
    "first , fixing the he abundance at the cosmic value and linking all the abundances of the metals together as a single parameter .",
    "then , linking c , n and o together and grouping the other metals ( ne , na , mg , al , si , s , cl , ar , ca , cr , fe , co , ni ) as another parameter , both fixing the abundance of the metals at 0.01 of the solar value and letting it vary freely . in all cases",
    "unacceptable results are obtained .",
    "no k@xmath32 iron line is present with a 90% confidence upper limit to the equivalent width of a narrow line of 50  ev .",
    "the positive residuals below 1  kev suggest the presence of either ( 1 ) partial covering , ( 2 ) an ionized absorber or ( 3 ) an additional soft component .",
    "thus , we first used the same model as before ( a power - law plus a disk - blackbody ) , but allowed the absorption of each component to vary separately , while being constrained to be not less than the galactic value .",
    "significantly better fits were obtained when the disk - blackbody suffered extra absorption , and so the absorption of the power - law component was set equal to the galactic value , @xmath33 ( @xmath31  atom  @xmath2 ) .",
    "the model can be written as follows :    @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the normalizations of the disk - blackbody and power - law components , and @xmath8 is the additional column density of the disk - blackbody .",
    "the best - fit values are  = @xmath37 atom @xmath2 , kt@xmath38 = @xmath39  kev , r@xmath40 = @xmath41  km , @xmath42 . although the fit is not formally acceptable with a @xmath43 of 177 for 125 degrees of freedom ( dof ) , the overall shape of the spectrum is reasonably well accounted for by this model .",
    "a significantly better fit is obtained if a partial covering absorption ( the pcfabs model in xspec ) replaces the different absorbing column for the two components .",
    "this model consists of a column density fixed at the galactic value , together with partial covering absorption for the previous two components ( a disk - blackbody and a power - law ) :    @xmath44 \\ ; ( i_{dbb } + \\ ;   i_{pl } ) , } \\ ] ] where   is the intrinsic absorption for both spectral components and f is the covering fraction ( @xmath45 ) . the @xmath46 is significantly reduced to 147.5 for 125 dof .",
    "the count and photon spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldarat ] and the best - fit parameters given in table  [ tab : spec_av ] .    in order to test the second possibility , we replaced the partial covering absorption with an ionized absorber ( absori in xspec ) in our best fit model .",
    "the new model resulted in a worse fit , both when the iron abundance was fixed at the  value ( @xmath46 = 176.6 for 125 dof and an ionization parameter l / nr@xmath47 = @xmath48 ) and when fixed at the solar value ( @xmath46 = 166.3 for 125 dof and an ionization parameter of @xmath49 ) .",
    "the final possibility is the presence of an additional soft component . to test this hypothesis ,",
    "we included a bremsstrahlung ( t @xmath50 kev ) , a blackbody , and a broad gaussian line to the disk - blackbody and power - law model .",
    "none of these additional components significantly improved the fit , giving values of @xmath46/dof of 229/124 , 890/127 and 245/123 , respectively .",
    "thus , we exclude the possibility that the low - energy residuals are caused by such an additional component .",
    "we therefore conclude that of the models tried , the partial covering gives the most reasonable fit and we refer to this subsequently as the best - fit model .",
    "the lower limit to any high energy cutoff is 60  kev at 90% confidence level . since fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] indicates that there are strong energy dependent intensity variations , we next investigated whether the best - fit model could be successfully applied to individual intensity selected spectra .",
    ".best - fit parameters for the overall bepposax spectrum .",
    "the model consists of a partial covering ( pcfabs ) absorption , , for a diskbb and a power - law ( see text ) .",
    "flux is in the 210  kev energy range and in units of .",
    "the luminosity ( 210  kev ) has been corrected for interstellar absorption and assumes a distance of 10.4  kpc ( durrel & harris @xcite ) [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we present results of a 1999 november bepposax observation of covering two partial eclipses and compare these with an earlier asca observation when the source had a similar 210  kev intensity .",
    "the decrease in the 0.110  kev flux during the partial eclipses is smooth and gradual and lasts for at least 0.2 in phase and the secondary minimum at @xmath51 is broader than the primary minima .",
    "the overall variation in the hardness ratios hr1 and hr2 reveals a complex behaviour , with a large change of the hr1 during the partial eclipses . in particular , no spectral softening with increasing intensity",
    "is found , contrary to the exosat results of callanan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the 0.1100  kev bepposax spectrum is unusually complex and can not be fit by any of the usual models applied to lmxrb such as an absorbed power - law and a blackbody .",
    "a good fit is obtained with the combination of a power - law and a disk - blackbody modified by a partial covering absorption ( with additional absorption fixed at the interstellar value ) .",
    "the same model provides a reasonable fit to an asca sis spectrum obtained in 1995 .",
    "we have divided the bepposax data into 4 intensity selected intervals and fit the above best - fit model to these data .",
    "we find a positive correlation between the disk - blackbody normalization and the source intensity with the disk - blackbody contributing between 24% and 62% of the total 210  kev flux .",
    "the absorption , the blackbody kt , @xmath9 , and the power - law normalization do not vary systematically as the 210  kev source intensity varies by a factor @xmath02 .",
    "a phase selected spectral analysis also shows a correlation of the disk - blackbody normalization with source intensity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "the variability of the disk - blackbody component dominates the overall intensity and hardness variations of the source .",
    "the variation in hardness ratio hr1 during the partial eclipse is better modeled by a variation in the contribution of the disk - blackbody component .",
    "the absorbing column density remains constant ( within uncertainties ) during and after the partial eclipse ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] ) .",
    "the secondary minimum is one of the most variable and puzzling feature of this source .",
    "its location at @xmath52 is difficult to explain in terms of material located in a bulge formed by the impact of an accretion stream with the outer edge of the the disk since this is usually located at @xmath53 ( see e.g. , white & holt @xcite ; mason & cordova @xcite ) .",
    "i93 and christian et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggest that the secondary minimum is due to obscuring material located in a ring at the circularization radius in the accretion disk , as in the model by frank et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . however , we find no evidence for a higher @xmath8 during the secondary minimum ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phase ] ) .",
    "we caution however , that the complex low - energy  spectrum makes the detailed interpretation of any spectral changes difficult .",
    "it is interesting to speculate as to the physical nature of the different components required to fit the  spectrum .",
    "the disk - blackbody component is most likely emission from the inner regions of the accretion disk and/or from a boundary layer ( see e.g. , popham & sunyaev @xcite ) .",
    "this emission is then scattered into the line of sight by the extended adc .",
    "the power - law component is usually interpreted as being due to the comptonization of soft photons by hot electrons located in the adc . in this case",
    ", the photon index translates into a comptonization y parameter of @xmath00.7",
    ". this non - thermal component does not show any evidence for a cut - off , with a lower limit of 60  kev , indicating that the electron temperature must be @xmath5420  kev .",
    "it is interesting to note that the adc source x1822371 has also a very complex x - ray spectrum . if the bepposax and asca spectra are fit with simple power - law model then a strong deficit is visible at @xmath01.5  kev",
    "this may be modeled as an edge at @xmath01.3  kev together with the intersection of power - law and blackbody components ( parmar et al .",
    "@xcite ) . there is also low - energy complexity in the spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ldarat ] ) , but no edge is required .",
    "this difference may be related to the low abundance appropriate to .",
    "it is suprising that the intensities of the two spectral components in  do not vary in the same way in the intensity selected fits .",
    "this would be the case if the modulation was simply caused by the geometric obscuration of a homogeneously emitting adc .",
    "the fact that the power - law normalization during the partial eclipses is perfectly consistent ( within the uncertainties ) with the values outside the partial eclipses ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : par ] ) , implies that the region emitting this component is significantly larger than the companion star . on the other hand",
    ", we note that the uncertainties on the power - law normalizations are large and an obscuration of an homogeneously emitting adc by a factor of @xmath03 during the partial eclipse by the companion star ( with the estimated dimensions ) would be undetectable as a decrease of this same factor in the power - law normalization ( within the uncertainties ) .",
    "the nature of the absorbed component required in both the bepposax and asca spectral fits is uncertain .",
    "one possibility is that this is emission that passes through structure at the outer edge of the accretion disk after first being scattered in the adc . rather than a single value of @xmath8 ,",
    "the measured valued would then represent an average , since a range of absorbing columns would be expected in this case .",
    "the orbital period p=17.11 hr implies the presence of a ( sub)giant companion ( e.g. , verbunt & van den heuvel @xcite ) .",
    "the parameters of the binary system can be derived from the orbital period @xmath55 and assuming the mass ratio , q , between the mass of the companion m@xmath56 and the mass of the neutron star m@xmath57 .",
    "taking m@xmath58 m@xmath22 ( the typical mass for a turn - off star in a globular cluster ) and m@xmath59 , the binary separation is a = 3@xmath60  cm , the radius r@xmath56 of the companion star , filling the roche lobe , is r@xmath61  cm , the disk radius is r@xmath62  cm , the diameter of the extended x - ray source ( adc ) is @xmath63  cm ( i93 ) .",
    "the nature of  is intriguing . the fact that  contains a neutron star was firmly established by the detection of a radius expansion x - ray burst during a @xmath64 observation in 1988 ( dotani et al .",
    "@xcite , van paradijs et al .",
    "although the @xmath64 large area counter has a large field of view ( 0.8@xmath65 x 1.7@xmath65 ) , it is clear that the burst came from  since there was no other known x - ray source in the field of view and between the precursor and the main peak of the burst there was a significant reduction in the persistent x - ray flux .",
    "thus the burst must almost certainly have come from the source of the persistent emission , .",
    "the detection of such a luminous ( @xmath7  erg  s@xmath4 at the peak , assuming isotropic emission ) burst indicates that at times the surface of the neutron star is directly observed . the evidence that  is primarily an adc source comes mainly from the extremely low @xmath66 ratio , typical of other adc sources ,",
    "the partial x - ray eclipses and the optical spectrum which resembles that of other adc sources ( e.g. , downes et al .",
    "1996 ) .    this apparantly discrepant nature could be resolved if the highly energetic burst ionized the absorbing material in the line of sight , as proposed by smale et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for an x - ray burst observed from the dipping lmxrb x1916053 . following smale et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , the number of photons per unit area emitted by the burst and available to ionize the obscuring material can be calculated from @xmath67 , where l is the luminosity of the burst , @xmath68 t the duration of the most luminous part of the burst , @xmath69 is the mean x - ray energy , and r the distance of the obscuring material to the source .",
