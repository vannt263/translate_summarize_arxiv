    "the performance of many single - photon based applications , such as optical quantum computing @xcite and quantum cryptography @xcite , critically depends on the ability to create single photons in pure spatiotemporal states and at high rates .",
    "there exist two basic types of single - photon sources to fulfill this need .",
    "the first is based on anti - bunched emission from single - emitter systems , such as atoms @xcite , ions @xcite , molecules @xcite , semiconductors @xcite , and quantum - dots @xcite .",
    "the second is based on `` heralding , '' in which one photon ( the `` signal '' ) is detected and used as a trigger to herald the presence of a paired photon ( the `` idler '' ) .",
    "sources of this type have been demonstrated mainly in guided nonlinear media , such as @xmath0 waveguides @xcite and @xmath1 fibers @xcite . heralded",
    "sources using guided media have one key advantage that the photons are generated in a single well - defined spatial mode , as opposed to a mixture of modes in the case of single - emitter sources .",
    "single photons produced in mono - mode fibers via heralding , in particular , can be losslessly coupled into standard telecom fibers @xcite .",
    "they thus have the potential to be a valuable resource for networked quantum information processing capable of harnessing the existing fiber - based telecommunications infrastructure .",
    "although heralded single - photon sources have several advantages , it is challenging to achieve simultaneously a high single - photon purity ( i.e. , high heralding efficiency ) and a high production rate , as such sources are constrained by a fundamental trade - off between the two .",
    "for example , a common method for achieving high purity is to apply narrowband spectral filtering to the signal photons before they are detected @xcite .",
    "this method rejects most of the usable pairs , resulting in a low single - photon production rate .",
    "an alternate method is to use spectrally - factorable photon - pair states @xcite .",
    "in such a method , however , one has to wait for a relatively long time before a second short - duration photon can be heralded . as a result ,",
    "the repetition rate of the heralded single - photon creation is restricted , resulting in a relatively low production rate .    to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "we have recently proposed a new approach to heralding pure single photons which does not rely on narrowband filtering or factorable photon - pair states @xcite .",
    "the idea is to apply appropriate spectral and temporal filtering to the signal photons , so that when detected , they collapse onto a single spectral ( temporal ) state . based on a simplified model , neglecting the effect of simultaneous multiple photon - pair emission , we have demonstrated via simulation that both a high purity and a high production rate can be simultaneously achieved , regardless of the spectral correlation properties of the paired photons .    in this paper , we extend our previous study @xcite to include the effect of multiple photon - pair emission . our goal is to identify the appropriate spectral and temporal filters for the various photon - pair correlations , for which the trade - off between high heralding efficiency and high production rate is optimally mitigated . to this end",
    ", we develop a multimode theory which describes the heralded creation of single photons in the presence of multipair emission .",
    "we then use the theory to numerically optimize the spectral and temporal filter widths for a variety of photon - pair correlations .",
    "the results reveal that while the optimization conditions vary for different correlations , the final performance using optimized filters is always quite similar . this",
    "interesting fact suggests that the key to achieving high performance in the heralded creation of single photons is to apply an appropriate measurement scheme to the signal photons .",
    "this approach is distinctly superior to the much recent effort that has been devoted to tailoring the phase - matching properties of nonlinear media in order to obtain spectrally factorable photon - pair states @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we present the multimode heralding theory in sec .",
    "[ model ] , study the optimization of measurement schemes in sec .  [ odt ] , and then conclude briefly in sec .",
    "in this section we develop a multimode theory modeling the heralded creation of single photons that generally applies to @xmath0 waveguides and @xmath1 fibers @xcite . in this model ,",
    "photon pairs are created via spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) or spontaneous four - wave mixing ( sfwm ) driven by pulsed pumps .",
    "the signal photons are passed through spectral and temporal filters before being measured by an on - off detector @xcite .",
    "a `` click '' of the detector heralds the presence of at least one idler photon . for the sake of computational simplicity , we assume a rectangular - shaped spectral filter with an angular - frequency bandwidth @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is in hz . for the temporal filter , we consider a rectangular shutter with a @xmath4-second time window that is shorter than the inherent time resolution of the detector . such a time shutter can be built using , for example , an ultrafast all - optical quantum switch @xcite .",
    "we next model the heralding stage .",
    "existing studies have been based on the schmidt - decomposition analysis , in which the joint two - photon spectral function ( [ psi2 ] ) is expanded onto a set of orthogonal schmidt modes .",
    "the purity of heralded single - photon states is then estimated from the expansion coefficients @xcite .",
    "this analysis , however , is inapplicable to photon - pair states containing more than one pair of photons .",
    "moreover , it is not physically rigorous because such schmidt modes in general are not the eigenmodes of the measurement apparatus for the signal photons . instead",
    ", a rigorous analysis must be developed following the quantum - measurement postulate , where a detection event collapses the signal - photon state onto an eigenstate of the measurement apparatus .",
    "for the present setup , such eigenstates correspond to a set of time- and bandwidth- limited modes that are chosen by following the standard procedure for the detection of band - limited signals over the measurement time @xcite . in the frequency domain ,",
    "the measurement eigenstates containing one and two photons are given by @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the order number of the eigenstates , and @xmath34 is a dimensionless parameter determining the mode structure .",
    "the mode function @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the angular prolate spheroidal functions .",
    "its corresponding eigenvalue is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the radial prolate spheroidal function . ordering @xmath39",
    ", @xmath40 represents the fundamental detection mode of our interest .    with the eigenstates ( [ 1 m ] ) and ( [ 2 m ] ) , the positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) for registering signal photons by an on / off detector is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the total detection efficiency including transmission losses and the inherent quantum efficiency of the detector . in arriving at this povm , we have assumed that at most two photons reach the detector simultaneously , consistent with our previous approximation that at most two pairs of photons can be created per pump pulse .",
    "furthermore , we have neglected the effects of both dark counts and after - pulsing in the detector .",
    "with @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ pon ] ) , the probability of a detector click is computed via @xmath45 , where the trace is carried over both the signal and idler photon states . from eqs .",
    "( [ psi1])([psi22 ] ) and ( [ 1m])([pon ] ) , we obtain @xmath46 where @xmath47 here , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the ( un - normalized ) heralded one - photon and two - photon wavefunctions for the idler photons , respectively , defined as @xmath50    from eqs .  ( [ p ] ) and ( [ ps ] ) , the detection efficiency of signal photons , i.e. , the probability for the signal - photon detector to click given that at least one photon pair is emitted , is given by @xmath51 after a detector click , one or more idler photons are heralded , whose reduced density matrix is given by @xmath52 , where the trace is carried over the signal - photon states only .",
    "after some algebra , we obtain @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the normalized reduced density matrices describing the idler - photon states containing one and two photons , respectively .",
    "they satisfy @xmath56 . for the one - photon density matrix ,",
    "we explicitly obtain @xmath57    in order to characterize the properties of the heralded photons , we expand @xmath54 onto a set of eigenstates @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , with ordered eigenvalues @xmath60 such that @xmath61 .",
    "we then compute the heralding efficiency @xmath62 defined as the probability of finding the idler photon in the single - photon state @xmath63 upon a detector click . from eq .",
    "( [ rhoi ] ) , we obtain @xmath64 we note that there is an alternate definition of heralding efficiency , which is the probability that an idler photon can be detected after heralding . that definition , however , does not capture the quality of the heralded photons and some measurement giving the purity of the heralded state must be specified .",
    "in contrast , the metric @xmath62 defined in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) captures both the detection efficiency and the purity of the heralded photons .",
    "the other important characteristic is the maximally - achievable production rate @xmath65 of the heralded photons , which can be defined as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the minimum amount of time required for a single heralding cycle . in practice",
    ", it is given by the largest of the following : the detection window @xmath4 , the temporal length of the pump pulses , the temporal length of the signal photons after the filter , and the underlying pulse length of the heralded state @xmath63 .",
    "for practical considerations , in this paper we define explicitly @xmath68,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are the coherence times of the pump pulses , the filtered signal photons , and the heralded state @xmath63 , respectively ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an explicit definition of the coherence time ) .    from eqs .",
    "( [ h ] ) and ( [ r ] ) , it is clear that there is an inherent trade - off between the heralding efficiency @xmath62 and the single - photon production rate @xmath65 .",
    "indeed , for given pump bandwidth @xmath72 , phase - matching coefficients @xmath73 , filtering bandwidth @xmath3 , and measurement window @xmath4 , the values of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath67 are fixed .",
    "then , @xmath65 increases monotonically with @xmath76 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath62 decreases monotonically with @xmath76 , due to the growing background emission of multiple photon pairs .",
    "hence , one must sacrifice the production rate @xmath65 for a higher heralding efficiency @xmath62 , or vice - verse .",
    "lastly , in the weak pumping regime where almost all single - photon sources operate in , the probability of emitting multiple photon pairs is much smaller than that of emitting a single pair .",
    "thus to a good approximation , @xmath77 hence , the trade - off between @xmath62 and @xmath65 is approximately linear .",
    "using the multimode theory developed in the previous section , we now study the optimization of measurement schemes for the best heralding performance in the presence of various photon - pair spectral correlations .",
    "this involves numerically identifying the appropriate spectral and temporal filtering windows which simultaneously maximize the heralding efficiency @xmath62 and the production rate @xmath65 .",
    "we first consider the photon - pair state ( [ psi1 ] ) with @xmath78 .",
    "this state exists approximately in a variety of photon - pair sources where the bandwidths of the phase - matching spectra are much broader than those of the pump and the signal spectral filter @xcite .",
    "the two - photon ( single - pair ) state in this case is not factorable according to the schmidt decomposition analysis , with the degree - of - factorization @xmath79 in the limit of large @xmath3 @xcite . in fig .",

    "we have chosen @xmath83 and @xmath84 such that in the weak - pump limit the heralding efficiency @xmath85 .",
