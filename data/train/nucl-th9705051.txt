    "dilepton production in heavy ion collisions is considered as a relatively clear signature of the nature of matter produced in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "this is one of reasons why the enhanced production of dileptons as observed recently in heavy ion collisions by ceres @xcite , helios @xcite and na-38 @xcite has received so much of attention .",
    "an attractive explanation of the peculiar dilepton mass shape is based on the brown - rho @xcite conjecture of decreasing @xmath1-meson mass with increasing density and temperature of hadronic matter , related to partial restoration of chiral symmetry .    when included into the transport codes the decreasing @xmath1-meson mass together with effects due to higher nucleon and @xmath2 resonancies can lead to a qualitative agreement with data @xcite .",
    "good description of dilepton mass spectra in s - au and s - w interactions has been obtained under the same assumption of the behaviour of @xmath3 by li , ko and brown @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present note is to point out that the formation time of pions produced in heavy - ion collisions leads also to modifications of the shape of dilepton mass spectrum enhancing the production of lighter dileptons with respect to heavier ones .",
    "the concept of the formation time has appeared a long time ago in connection with the problem of how fast is the electromagnetic field accompanying a charged particle reconstructed after an abrupt change of the momentum of the particle .",
    "early literature on the question can be traced back e.g. from ref.@xcite . in connection with production of secondary particles in hadronic collisions",
    "the concept has been introduced by stodolsky @xcite . in analysis of data",
    "@xcite on multiparticle production in proton - nucleus interactions it has turned out @xcite that the cascading of secondaries is considerably lower than expected under the assumption that a secondary pion is able to interact immediatelly after it has been produced in a nucleon - nucleon collision and this has been ascribed to the formation time of secondary particles .",
    "the term `` formation time '' has somewhat different meaning in different models .",
    "in what follows we shall understand this term as the time interval between the time of the collision in which the secondary hadron has been produced and the time when this hadron is able to interact strongly ( with the full cross - section ) with other hadrons .",
    "for the dilepton production in @xmath4 interaction the formation time is relevant , since the process goes via the intermediate @xmath1-meson stage @xmath5 and the first part of the process is strong .",
    "we also assume that the formation time of a pion is characterized by @xmath6 which denotes the formation time of the pion in its rest frame and in other frames it is lorentz dilated .    to see in a very qualitative way the effect of formation time on dilepton spectra consider a set of pions produced at @xmath7 in a volume of typical dimension @xmath8 .",
    "a pion with four - momentum @xmath9 is unable to interact before time @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the lorentz time - dilation factor . within this time the pion traverses the distance @xmath12 .",
    "faster pions traverse longer distances before interacting . as a consequence thereof ,",
    "interactions of slower pions are prefered and this leads to softening of dilepton spectra produced via @xmath0 .",
    "this mechanism will be important in situations when each of pions undergoes only a few collisions .",
    "when the number of collisions , even for fast pions is large , the system thermalizes and the spectrum of dileptons corresponds to interactions of fully formed pions in such a thermalized system .",
    "suppose that the system of pions produced in a heavy ion collision is described by a distribution function @xmath13 in phase space , where @xmath14 .",
    "the standard expression for the rate of dilepton production is ( see e.g. @xcite ) :    @xmath15 \\label{1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 is the cross - section for @xmath0 at given @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the relative velocity .",
    "distribution functions @xmath13 depend on the cross - section @xmath20 for @xmath21 which regulates scattering of pions , and on the value of the formation time .",
    "multiplying and dividing the right - hand side of eq.(2.1 ) by @xmath22 and integrating over @xmath23 we obtain    @xmath24 \\label{2}\\ ] ]    which can be rewritten as @xmath25    where @xmath26 is simply distribution of the number of @xmath27 collisions as a function of the mass of the @xmath27 system and @xmath28 denotes the ratio of the number of @xmath29 collisions to all @xmath30 interactions .",
    "the expression @xmath26 is calculated by monte - carlo method in a given cascade code .",
    "the term @xmath31 is the total @xmath27 cross - section including @xmath32 and @xmath33 waves plus possibly higher ones .",
    "the term @xmath34 is the @xmath35 cross - section which can be taken in the simplest approximation as    @xmath36^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\big[1-\\frac{4m_{e}^2}{s}\\big]^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\big[1 + 2\\frac{m_e^2}{s}\\big]|f_{\\pi}|^2 \\label{4}\\ ] ]    this result follows directly from a calculation of the feynman diagram . neglecting the electron mass @xmath37 with respect to @xmath17 we obtain    @xmath36^{\\frac{1}{2 } }    \\label{5}\\ ] ]    the form- factor squared @xmath38 can be simply parametrized in the bright - wigner approximation as    @xmath39    in practical calculations we have used a multiple scattering model @xcite inspired by that used by humanic @xcite , see also ref.@xcite .",
    "since @xmath27 interactions are most likely responsible for the enhanced production of dileptons with masses below 1gev/@xmath40 we have studied only a simple version of the multiple scattering model in which all secondary hadrons are pions .",
    "the initial state for the evolution of the cascade is given by set of momenta and positions in which pions are created in nucleon - nucleon sub - collisions .",
    "this initial state has been generated by the monte - carlo model of zvada @xcite .",
    "we have used isospin averaged @xmath27 cross section ( see e.g. appendix in ref.@xcite ) :    @xmath41    the total cross - section is obtained by integrating over a half of the angular space ( due to identity of particles ) @xmath42    here @xmath43 is the phase shift in the partial wave with isospin @xmath44 and orbital momentum @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the cms scattering angle , @xmath47 is the cms energy squared and @xmath48 denotes the cms momentum .",
    "rescattering program follows trajectory of each pion in short time steps and when the distance between two pions is smaller than @xmath49 the pions scatter according the cross- section given by eq.(2.7 ) .",
    "the scattering angle is determined in cms frame of two pions being scattered and then momenta of pions are transformed back to the global frame of the simulation .",
    "the scattering is assumed @xcite to take time interval @xmath50 of the order of 1fm / c , which roughly corresponds to @xmath51 . during this time interval",
    "the participating pions are unable to interact again .    in contradistinction to other monte - carlo cascade codes , like e.g.@xcite",
    "we take initial conditions directly from a realistic model @xcite of pion production in nuclear collisions and introduce the formation time @xmath52 in the way discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the formation time characterizes the formation of pion in its rest frame .    for times lower than lorentz",
    "dilated formation time @xmath53 a pion created in the initial state is unable to interact .",
    "the formation time is lorentz dilated , whereas the time @xmath50 is fixed in the global frame of simulation which is cms of pb+pb system .",
    "rate of collisions per pion varies from 3.7 for @xmath54 to 1.0 for @xmath55 in our simulation .",
    "we guess that effects of non - locality ( see e.g. @xcite ) present also in our rescattering simulation do not influence substantially results for dilepton mass spectrum .",
    "we have run the rescattering program for three different values of formation time parameter @xmath6 using initial state of pion gas generated by cascading generator @xcite for pb+pb 160 gev / n b=7fm collisions",
    ". mass spectrum of dileptons was calculated according to the equation ( 2.3 ) from the mass spectrum of @xmath27 collisions obtained from the simulation .",
    "cross sections given by ( 2.4 ) and ( 2.8 ) were properly normalized and resulting distribution of dileptons was rescaled to the @xmath56 mev bin size , charged multiplicity @xmath57 and yield of dileptons per unit of rapidity . in fig.1",
    "we present the shape and magnitude of dilepton mass spectrum as a function of the formation time @xmath6 .",
    "the interpretation of this dependence is simple .",
    "dilepton yields for low masses are almost independent on @xmath6 since slower pions are formed rather fast . on the other hand dileptons with masses in the @xmath1-meson region",
    "are suppressed for larger values of the formation time .",
    "this is due to the lorentz dilation factor @xmath58 which permits faster pions to escape from the interaction region with little or no rescattering or annihilation .    0.7 cm    = 10.7 cm    1.7pt    0.5 cm    in fig.2 we compare the excess of dileptons as observed by ceres collaboration @xcite with our calculations of dilepton production due to @xmath30 annihilation as given in fig.1 .",
    "data points and the line which gives the expected dilepton production as extrapolated from proton - nucleus interactions are taken from @xcite .",
    "our results presented in fig.1 are added to the extrapolated continuous line .",
    "0.7 cm    = 10.7 cm    1.7pt    0.5 cm    the comparison shows that a rough and qualitative agreement could be reached for formation times @xmath59 fm .",
    "this comparison ( fig.2 ) can only serve as a very qualitative argument , since the extrapolation procedure usually used to get the background line in fig.2 is based on assumption that @xmath1-meson dilepton decays and other contributions to dilepton production can be simply rescaled from proton - nucleus to nucleus - nucleus collisions",
    ". this may be quite a rough approximation since @xmath1-mesons and other resonancies rescatter in pb - pb collisions with much larger probability than in proton - nucleon case .",
    "we think that quantitative analysis can be based only on a detailed monte - carlo code containing @xmath1-mesons and other resonancies in the initial state and taking their rescattering into account .",
    "we have shown above that the value of formation time @xmath6 strongly influences the shape and magnitude of the mass spectrum of dileptons produced in @xmath30 annihilation .",
    "this concerns in particular the ratio of low mass dileptons to those in the @xmath1-meson region .",
    "we have also shown that the shape and order of magnitude of the dilepton production due to @xmath60 annihilations roughly corresponds to the excess of dileptons as observed by the ceres and helios collaborations at the cern sps , both in the low mass and @xmath1-meson region .",
    "contribution around @xmath61 mev / c@xmath62 may still be missing .",
    "the excess of dileptons as observed at cern - sps is of a similar shape as that observed by dls collaboration @xcite .",
    "we think that the question whether formation time effects in calculations like @xcite can bring models closer to data deserves a detailed study .",
    "we are indebted to peter zvada for generating the initial state for our rescattering code and to a.nogov for collaboration at the early stages of this study .",
    "this work was supported by grant committee vega g - f01 in slovak republic ."
