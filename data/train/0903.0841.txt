    "a rigorous proof of phase transitions for continuous models of the statistical mechanics is still an open problem if the interactions between particles are described by conventional in physics potential functions .",
    "the first and yet to this moment the only example of the rigorous proof of the phase transition in a continuous model is the result by j.l .",
    "lebowitz , a.  mazel and e.  presutti in @xcite .",
    "the potential functions in @xcite are a pre - limiting version of the mean - field interaction , see @xcite , having a large but finite radius of the interactions , and a four - body stabilizing potential function .    in the present work",
    ", we investigate the percolation properties of an interacting particle ensemble .",
    "we describe a phase diagram of the continuous system in the plane @xmath0 , _ the poisson rate  the inverse temperature_. the interaction is defined by pair potential functions .",
    "we do not prove the phase transition driven by boundary conditions as in @xcite .",
    "however we think that the transition : _ the percolation  the non - percolation _ can be considered as a phase transition relatively , for example , to the conductivity of the matter or the velocity of the sound propagations .",
    "the book @xcite gives a rather complete picture of the state of the continuum percolation theory for the ideal gas from the mathematical point of view .",
    "much attention in @xcite is drawn to the boolean percolation problem for the poisson point processes in @xmath2 .",
    "points of a configuration of the process are considered as the centers of closed balls of a random radius ( _ boolean radius _ ) such that the radii corresponding to different points are independent of each other ( and also independent of the process ) and identically distributed .",
    "the existence of an unbounded connected component in the set composed by the union of all random balls means the percolation .",
    "the unbounded component is called an infinite cluster .",
    "one of the main results in @xcite which is related to the present article is about the existence of a critical value @xmath3 of the rate of the poisson point processes .",
    "namely , the value @xmath3 distinguishes the percolation and the non - percolation , where the last means that with the probability 1 only bounded connected components exist in the union of the balls .",
    "it is asserted in @xcite that with the probability 1 there are no infinite clusters when @xmath4 and there exists an infinite cluster when @xmath5 .",
    "we consider the same problem but for a non - ideal gas , which is determined by some interaction potential function and the poisson free measure with the rate @xmath6 a non - percolation condition was studied in the work @xcite for positive finite range potential functions .",
    "the boolean radius is equal to the range of the interaction .",
    "a new proof of this result can be found in @xcite .",
    "next we give a brief description of our results not concerning the conditions .",
    "we study the case when the potential function takes as positive as negative values .",
    "the potential function determines a gibbs measure of which the percolation properties we investigate . in this case",
    "a new parameter enters into the game it is temperature @xmath7 . by a tradition we more often use the inverse temperature @xmath8 .",
    "the results we present here outline two regions in the plane @xmath0 of the percolation and the non - percolation with probability 1 for a boolean radius @xmath9 .",
    "we do not seek the solution as precise as possible .",
    "our aim is to outline the regions such that they have typical forms .",
    "namely ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) :    the region of the non - percolation can be described as follows .",
    "_ there exists a density value @xmath10 such that for any @xmath11 there exists an inverse temperature @xmath12 such that for any @xmath13 all clusters are finite with gibbs probability 1 . _",
    "the region of the percolation can be described as follows .",
    "_ for any density @xmath14 there exists an inverse temperature @xmath15 such that for all @xmath16 there exists an infinite cluster with gibbs probability 1 .",
    "there exists a density value @xmath17 such that @xmath18 if @xmath19 _",
    "our results provide estimates of the parameter regions separating the areas of the existence @xmath20 and of the non - existence @xmath21 of an infinite cluster .",
    "there exists a region between @xmath20 and @xmath21 where our result does not give the answer on the percolation .",
    "the result shows in particular that for any small density @xmath14 there exists an infinite cluster if temperature is low enough .",
    "another feature is also that the non - existence of an infinite cluster may only be at a small density , @xmath11 .",
    "this fact is in accord with the result ( @xcite ) of the boolean non - percolation for the ideal gas .",
    "the conditions under which we prove the percolation and the non - percolation are different .",
    "we prove the percolation result in @xmath1 only .",
    "it is necessary as well , that the potential function has an attractive part .",
    "however , we do not assume a hard core .",
    "our proof of the non - percolation requires the hard - core condition .",
    "the attractive part of the potential as well as the dimension of the euclidean space are not restrictions for our proof of the non - percolation . besides , all results are proved for a non - random boolean radius @xmath9 .",
    "the technics for the proofs of the existence and of the non - existence of an infinite cluster drastically differ .",
    "for the existence of an infinite cluster we use technics close to the contour methods ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the non - existence is proved by a coupling of the gibbs state and a branching process .",
    "the extinction of the branching process leads to the non - existence of infinite clusters .",
    "we use a branching process with interactions between offsprings in the same generations and between the generations .",
    "the hard core condition prevents the accumulations of a large offspring amount which can appear because of attractive interactions between the offsprings .",
