    "the study of pion double charge exchange ( dcx ) has been pursued with the aim of elucidating the mechanisms of multiple pion interactions in nuclei . whatever the details of the mechanism , this reaction must at least result in the charges of two nucleons being changed .",
    "indeed , it has been found that the simplest picture of the reaction , in which it proceeds by successive single charge exchanges ( see fig .  1 ) , provides a qualitative explanation of the systematics that are observed @xcite .",
    "serious investigation of the inclusive dcx reaction began in 1980 , with the first measurement using modern equipment of the doubly differential cross section for @xmath3o@xmath4x at three angles with 240 mev pions performed at sin ( now psi ) @xcite .",
    "subsequently , an extensive series of measurements of inclusive double charge exchange cross sections was carried out at the los alamos meson physics facility @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 reaction was studied in @xmath6he , and the @xmath7 reactions in nine nuclei : @xmath8he , @xmath0li , @xmath1be , @xmath2c , @xmath3o , @xmath9ca , @xmath10rh , and @xmath11pb .",
    "doubly differential cross sections were measured for each target over the outgoing pion energy range from 10 mev up to the kinematic limit , at three to five angles for incident pion energies in the range from 120 to 270 mev .",
    "some 300 pion energy spectra have been obtained with good statistics and absolute accuracies of 10 - 15% .",
    "the systematics of the reaction in @xmath3o , @xmath9ca , @xmath10rh , and @xmath11pb revealed by these experiments has been previously discussed @xcite .",
    "briefly , it is found that only in @xmath3o do the doubly differential cross sections much resemble the most likely phase space distribution ( that containing a pion , two nucleons and a residual nucleus ) or , in fact , any other reasonable distribution generated by assuming that the mechanism is governed by a constant matrix element . in the heavier nuclei",
    "the distribution of outgoing pions is strongly peaked toward lower energies and depleted at higher energies when compared to the phase space distribution .",
    "the doubly differential cross sections for dcx in @xmath6he and @xmath8he exhibited striking double peaked outgoing pion energy spectra at forward angles ( 25@xmath12 , 50@xmath12 ) that evolved into a single peak distribution as the angle of observation reached 130@xmath12 .",
    "this feature was most pronounced at an incident energy of 240 mev , but persisted at incident energies down to 150 mev in @xmath8he @xcite and 120 mev in @xmath6he @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report measurements of the doubly differential cross section for inclusive dcx in the light @xmath13-shell",
    "nuclei @xmath0li , @xmath1be , and @xmath2c .",
    "these observations will serve to trace the evolution of the double peaked structure into a nearly featureless spectrum as the complexity of the target nucleus is increased .",
    "a second objective of the present work was to investigate , by comparing the @xmath14 reactions in @xmath15li and @xmath16li , the effect on the dcx cross section of a single extra neutron in the target nucleus .",
    "only fragmentary data for dcx in these nuclei existed prior to the present measurement .",
    "_ have reported a few measurements at 0@xmath12 for @xmath4 in li and be @xcite and @xmath17 in @xmath16li , @xmath1be , and @xmath2c @xcite , at incident energies in the 200 mev region .",

    "in the present experiment , the inclusive dcx processes @xmath7 have been investigated by measuring the doubly differential cross sections , @xmath21 , at three to five angles in the range 25@xmath12130@xmath12 , for incident pion energies between 120 and 240 mev . at each angle , the range of outgoing pion energies from 10 mev up to the kinematic limit for each reaction was covered .",
    "preliminary results of this experiment were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the experiment was performed with incident @xmath22 beams from the high - energy pion channel ( `` p@xmath6 '' ) at the los alamos meson physics facility .",
    "the outgoing pions were detected using a 180@xmath12 vertical bend , double focusing magnetic spectrometer , with an effective solid angle of about 16 msr and a momentum bite of about 8% , as shown in fig .",

    "_ @xcite and will be treated only briefly here .",
    "the detector system had five components : a wire chamber ( wc0 ) placed in the mid - plane of the spectrometer , two wire chambers ( wc1 and wc2 ) near the focal plane that were used to reconstruct trajectories , a 1.6 mm scintillator ( s1 ) behind wc1 and wc2 that provided an accurate time reference for the trigger as well as pulse height information , and a fluorocarbon ( fc-88 ) erenkov detector that distinguished electrons from pions .",
    "the trigger was a fourfold coincidence among the three wire chambers and the scintillator .",
    "inclusion of wc0 guaranteed that a particle had passed through the spectrometer .",
    "the timing information available from this chamber was also used to distinguish pions from very slow protons .",
    "all of the targets ( @xmath15li , @xmath16li , @xmath1be , @xmath2c ) in this experiment were solid rectangular slabs .",
    "in addition , a polyethylene ( ch@xmath23 ) target was employed to simultaneously normalize both the beam flux and spectrometer acceptance by observing elastic @xmath24 scattering .",
    "the targets were mounted in aluminum frames on a ladder that could be raised or lowered ( to place the target of interest in the incident beam ) and rotated about the vertical axis ( to orient the plane of the target at an appropriate angle with respect to the beam ) .    before reaching the target ,",
    "the pion beam passed through an ionization chamber that was used to determine the relative flux . since this device was sensitive to all charged particles in the beam , it was necessary to normalize the flux measurement each time the beam transport elements were adjusted .",
    "downstream of the target the pion beam impinged on a ch@xmath23 slab from which pions scattered at 90@xmath12 on each side of the beam were detected by scintillator telescopes , in order to monitor the position of the incident beam and to provide a cross - check of the ionization chamber .    to measure the doubly differential dcx cross sections each target",
    "was exposed to an incident pion beam and events were recorded at a series of spectrometer momentum settings until the measured statistical uncertainties in the number of detected pions were approximately 5% .",
    "data were collected at 10 mev intervals in outgoing pion energy .",
    "in addition , background observations were made at a selected set of spectrometer settings using an empty target frame .",
    "each time the incident pion charge or energy was changed , a series of ch@xmath23 normalizations was performed .",
    "the goal of this experiment was to measure a doubly differential cross section for each reaction , incident pion energy , scattering angle , and outgoing pion energy .",
    "the doubly differential cross section is related to observable quantities as follows : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of pions detected , @xmath27 is the number of incident pions , @xmath28 is the effective thickness of the target , @xmath29 is the target density , @xmath30 is the effective solid angular acceptance , @xmath31 is the range of outgoing pion energy , @xmath32 is the correction of the spectrometer acceptance due to multiple scattering and energy loss , @xmath33 is the correction due to pion decay , and @xmath34 is the dead - time correction .    the analysis procedure is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and will only be summarized here .",
    "( see also refs .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "calibration constants relating time differences of the signals from the wire chambers to positions on the focal plane were established by placing a collimated @xmath35fe source at precisely measured positions in front of the chambers . in the data analysis ,",
    "the position information from wc1 and wc2 for each event was used to reconstruct the particle trajectory back to the focal plane of the spectrometer .",
    "reconstructed trajectories were tested for conformity with the distribution in phase space of particles that could have been transmitted by the spectrometer from the target to the focal plane .",
    "positive pions and protons were generally distinguished on an event - by - event basis by means of their different pulse heights in the scintillator , or , in some cases , by their time - of - flight between wc0 and s1 .",
    "since pions and electrons both emit erenkov radiation in fc-88 at spectrometer settings greater than 180 mev / c ( @xmath36 mev ) , it was not possible to use the erenkov detector to distinguish electrons from pions on an event - by - event basis . instead , a statistical method was used , which is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and is very similar to that described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the momentum acceptance , @xmath37 , and dispersion were determined by changing the spectrometer magnetic field to move a @xmath24 elastic scattering peak across the spectrometer focal plane . the relative acceptance as a function of focal plane position obtained by this method",
    "was used to correct @xmath38 .",
    "the effective total momentum acceptance was determined to be about 8% by integration across the entire focal plane .      the absolute number of incident pions , @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : xsect ] ) , was obtained by comparison of @xmath24 elastic scattering measurements with known cross sections determined from the energy - dependent phase shift program scatpi  @xcite .",
    "the effective total solid angle , @xmath30 , was included in this calibration .",
    "this procedure was repeated at several scattering angles for each setting of the beam transport system in order to improve the accuracy of the normalization , as well as to check for the presence of angle - dependent systematic errors .      a linear interpolation between the spectrometer momentum settings at which empty - frame ( background ) measurements were made was used to obtain the background contribution which",
    "was then subtracted from the raw dcx spectra .",
    "the largest backgrounds occurred at the lowest measured outgoing pion energy of 10 mev and were about 25% of the foreground .",
    "corrections were made to account for other effects that would change the shape and magnitude of the measured cross sections .",
    "the number of pions detected was reduced by decay as they traveled from the target to the detectors .",
    "approximately 80% of the pions survived at 200 mev , while at 10 mev only 30% survived . some of the decay muons traversed the spectrometer , while others did not .",
    "moreover , it was possible for pions emerging from the target that would not have traversed the spectrometer to decay into muons that could do so .",
    "since the detector system could not separate the muons from pions , these effects were accounted for by monte carlo methods which produced the factor @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : xsect ] ) .",
    "this procedure is described in detail in refs.@xcite .",
    "the fraction of muon contamination ranges from 1% at 10 mev to 20% at 200 mev outgoing pion kinetic energy .",
    "energy loss and multiple scattering in the target and in wc0 changed the effective acceptance of the spectrometer ; these were corrected for by the factor @xmath32 , which was determined by simulation to be different from unity only for outgoing pion energies less than 30 mev .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath32 was about 1.3 .",
    "integration of the doubly differential cross sections over outgoing pion energy , using the trapezoid rule , yielded an angular distribution .",
    "the angular distributions were fitted with sums of legendre polynomials , which were integrated to determine a quantity which we term the `` total reaction cross section . '' the uncertainties in these procedures are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and were less than , or comparable to , the systematic uncertainties discussed in the next section .",
    "the uncertainty in the normalization of the cross section contains contributions from uncertainties in the thicknesses of the targets ( 23% ) and in the phase shift prediction of the free @xmath24 cross section ( 2% ) @xcite . the uncertainty in the determination of a particle s position in the spectrometer focal plane and of the spectrometer acceptance function are each estimated to be 1% .",
    "for the measurements at 180 mev and 240 mev there is an additional 4% uncertainty in a correction for trigger inefficiency .",
    "the uncertainties due to the determination of electronics deadtime , spectrometer dispersion , and wire chamber efficiency were insignificant compared to those listed above . in addition , there is an uncertainty due to slowly varying changes in the response of the ionization chamber used to monitor the incident beam flux .",
    "these variations were monitored by comparison with the primary proton beam monitor and the downstream scattering monitor , and were observed to occur on roughly the same time scale as changes of spectrometer angle . the resulting uncertainty is thus treated as an angle - dependent uncertainty .",
    "there are also uncertainties that depend on the outgoing pion energy .",
    "these include contributions from the electron - pion separation procedure , which were between 2% and 5% , from estimates of the corrections for energy loss and multiple scattering in the target and in the mid - spectrometer wire chamber , and from effects of pion decay and muon contamination , which contributed an additional 5% .",
    "table i lists the systematic uncertainties for each incident beam .      for incident",
    "pion energies above about 170 mev , detection of an outgoing pion of charge opposite to that of the incident pion no longer provides a unique signature of dcx , as the processes @xmath39 or @xmath40 can occur on one of the target nucleons .",
    "although the contribution of pion - induced pion production ( pipp ) is negligible ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) for incident energy 180 mev , this effect must be taken into account at 240 mev .    to estimate the contribution of pipp",
    ", we follow the procedure used in ref .",
    "@xcite . assuming that pipp in a nucleus occurs as a quasi - free process on a single nucleon , the effects of absorption and other competing @xmath41-nucleus reactions and of the nuclear medium are taken into account by multiplying the free nucleon pipp cross section by an `` effective '' number of nucleons , @xmath42 .",
    "an extensive study of @xmath41-nucleus reactions was reported by ashery _",
    "et al._@xcite , from which values of @xmath42 were extracted .",

    "] at 240 mev , the double - peaked structure is prominent in @xmath8he , apparent in the li isotopes , disappearing for @xmath1be , and is absent in @xmath2c and @xmath3o . at 180 mev the double - peaked structure is only seen in the @xmath8he spectrum , although the data for @xmath0li and @xmath1b exhibit strength at high energy that does not appear in the @xmath2c and @xmath3o spectra .",
    "we note that in @xmath8he the double peaks are still visible at 150 mev @xcite , and in @xmath6he at all energies down to 120 mev @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the relative size of the pipp contribution , shown as the dotted curves in fig .",
    "8(a ) , decreases with increasing @xmath52 .",
    "the origin of the double - peaked structure has been discussed previously ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and has been argued to be consistent with a sequential single charge exchange mechanism . in the @xmath57 resonance region",
    "the @xmath41-nucleon cross section is strongly forward- and backward - peaked .",
    "two forward scatterings or two backward scatterings , which are favored over scattering at intermediate angles , can yield an outgoing dcx pion at forward angles : in the former case the pion emerges with high energy ; in the latter case it emerges with lower energy . a theoretical model based on these ideas",
    "was developed by kinney and successfully applied to dcx data on @xmath8he @xcite and , subsequently , @xmath6he @xcite .",
    "given the prominent double - peaked structure in the @xmath15li cross section , we have extended the model to this nucleus , and will show the results in the next section .",
    "alqadi and gibbs @xcite have presented calculations for dcx in @xmath8he which they compare with the data given in ref .",
    "these authors found that including pipp in their intranuclear cascade model was essential to produce reasonable agreement with the data at 240 mev , and suggest that this mechanism is largely responsible for the low - energy peak in the pion energy spectra .",
    "the contribution of pipp for @xmath58 , obtained as discussed previously , is shown by the dashed curves in fig .",
    "8(a ) .",
    "as described in the previous section , the doubly differential cross sections were integrated to yield angular distributions ( see ref .",
    "a typical set of results , those for @xmath15li , is shown in fig .",
    "9 . for this nucleus and",
    "the other nuclei investigated , the angular distribution is seen to be forward peaked at 240 mev and to become more isotropic as the incident energy decreases .",
    "no significant difference is seen in the angular dependences of the @xmath4 and @xmath17 cross sections in those nuclei for which both were measured .",
    "although the angular distributions are relatively featureless , their shape does exhibit a consistent @xmath52-dependence , becoming less forward - peaked as @xmath52 increases . as a measure of the forward - peaking , the ratios of the cross sections measured at @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the @xmath61 reactions at 240 mev for @xmath62 were calculated and are displayed in table iii .",
    "the observed trend is consistent with the increased probability of absorption of forward - going pions as @xmath52 increases ; the dcx pion has a greater chance of escaping from the `` rear '' of a heavy nucleus .",
    "the unusually small ratio seen for @xmath11pb@xmath17 may be attributable to the large excess of neutrons , with which the incoming @xmath19 preferentially interacts , in this nucleus .",
    "total dcx reaction cross sections were determined as described in the previous section ; the results for the light @xmath13-shell nuclei are given in table iv .",
    "the quoted errors include statistics , systematics , and the uncertainties arising from the integration procedures .",
    "the numbers in parentheses for 240 mev incident pions are the cross sections after the subtraction of the estimated contributions of pipp .    for a self - conjugate nucleus , the @xmath4 and @xmath17 cross",
    "sections should be equal , apart from differences attributable to the different binding energies of the final state nuclei , which would affect primarily the high - energy end of the outgoing pion energy spectrum .",
    "the total cross sections for dcx in @xmath3o and @xmath9ca were found to be equal within the experimental uncertainties @xcite , although the @xmath17 cross section slightly exceeded the @xmath4 cross section for @xmath9ca .",
    "table iv shows the two cross sections for @xmath15li to be essentially equal within errors .",
    "starting from the notion that double charge exchange proceeds by sequential single charge exchange scatterings competing with more probable reactions that either interrupt the sequence or scatter pions out of the nucleus before it starts , a `` scaling rule''was found which organizes the @xmath52-dependence of the total cross section for both the @xmath4 and @xmath17 reactions @xcite . according to this rule the total cross section for dcx should vary as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number of nucleons ( @xmath44 or @xmath43 ) on which dcx occurs for a given incident pion charge ( positive or negative ) ; the factor @xmath65 is proportional to the projected area of the nucleus .",
    "total dcx reaction cross sections in nuclei ranging in mass from @xmath15li to @xmath11pb are found substantially to obey this rule ; only the isotopes of he violate it @xcite .",
    "given that the scaling rule is based on the classical transport of pions through nuclear matter , it is perhaps surprising that the agreement is so good , especially for the light nuclei .",
    "the validity of the rule has recently been discussed by buss _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "let us examine the predictions of the scaling rule in more detail for the light @xmath13-shell nuclei .",
    "by comparing the @xmath7 cross sections in @xmath15li and @xmath16li , one can examine the effect of adding one neutron . for @xmath4",
    "one is adding a target nucleon ; for @xmath17 one is adding a source of competing reactions and the number of target nucleons is unchanged .",
    "( 2 ) predicts the ratios @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "note that in the absence of competing reactions @xmath68 would be equal to unity .",
    "the observed ratios are given in table v. the agreement between experiment and prediction for @xmath68 is excellent at both 180 and 240 mev ; the observed values of @xmath69 slightly exceed those predicted .",
    "we can further examine the rule by comparing the @xmath4 and @xmath17 reactions in the @xmath70 nuclei . in @xmath16li and @xmath1be ,",
    "the extra neutron should enhance the @xmath4 reaction by providing more targets for the charge - exchange reactions and suppress the @xmath17 reaction by providing more targets for the competing reactions .",
    "( 2 ) predicts ratios of @xmath4 to @xmath17 of 2.67 in @xmath16li and 2.08 in @xmath1be .",
    "the experimental ratios of the total cross sections , given in table vi , are seen to agree well with these predictions at 240 mev but to exceed them at 180 mev .    to avoid additional uncertainties and assumptions , the ratios in tables v and vi",
    "were obtained from the measured cross sections without the subtraction of pipp .",
    "it was found that performing this subtraction does not alter the ratios outside their uncertainties and thus does not alter the conclusions drawn .",
    "in the intranuclear cascade calculation of oset and collaborators @xcite , the probabilities for pion quasi - elastic scattering and absorption are computed using a microscopic model in which the pion is propagated classically through the nucleus .",
    "quasi - elastic single charge exchange as well as non - charge exchange interactions are allowed , and thus this model can be employed to generate dcx cross sections based on the sequential single charge exchange mechanism .",
    "the calculation is performed in infinite nuclear matter , invoking the local density approximation to evaluate the reaction probabilities .",
    "further details of the calculation may be found in ref .",
    "results of this calculation have previously been compared with dcx data on @xmath3o , @xmath9ca , @xmath10rh , and @xmath11pb @xcite .",
    "@xcite also contains some comparisons with results of the present experiment for @xmath1be and @xmath2c .",
    "the predictions of this model are compared with the present data for @xmath15li@xmath4 and @xmath16li@xmath4 at 240 mev in figs .",
    "10 and 11 , respectively .",
    "a persistent feature of the calculations is a low - energy peak that is not seen in the data .",
    "a hint of the double - peaked structure seen in the forward - angle spectra does appear in the calculation , but the high energy peak is at too high an energy and of insufficient amplitude to match that observed .",
    "comparison of this calculation with data on @xmath1be shows qualitatively similar results ",
    "see fig .",
    "6 of ref .  @xcite .",
    "if one attributes the measured strength in the low - energy region of the forward angle spectra to pipp , as suggested by the work of alqadi and gibbs @xcite , then the disagreement between the measured and calculated doubly - differential cross sections is even more striking .    given the disparities in the measured and calculated doubly differential cross sections , comparison of the integrated cross sections may not be very meaningful .",
    "however , it can be seen by inspection of the energy spectra that the magnitude of the cross section is better reproduced by the theory for @xmath16li than for @xmath15li .",
    "12 shows the theory and measurement for @xmath16li@xmath17 at 240 mev .",
    "the comparison of theory and experiment is qualitatively similar to that for @xmath16li@xmath4 .",
    "calculations have also been performed @xcite at 180 mev and 120 mev .",
    "although the calculation reproduces the approximate isotropy of the cross sections at these lower energies , quantitative comparisons are on the whole no more successful than at the higher energy .",
    "but perhaps it is not surprising that a calculation designed for heavy nuclei can not predict the details of the dcx process in these very light nuclei .",
    "vicente - vacas and oset @xcite comment that a major weakness of their calculation is the fact that the model @xcite predicts narrower quasi - elastic scattering peaks than are observed , and that this might have a bearing on the discrepancy seen between theory and measurement for light nuclei .",
    "we next compare our data with the predictions of a model developed by kinney @xcite based on the sequential single charge exchange mechanism .",
    "this treatment is an extension of some of the work of van loon @xcite and relies on the formalism developed by thies @xcite to describe inelastic , multistep reactions with quantum - mechanical transport theory .",
    "the essential features of the calculation are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; an extended description is contained in ref . @xcite . in this model",
    "the incident pion interacts sequentially with two like - charge nucleons only , and thus only the leading , or `` double scattering '' , term in the transition matrix is used , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath71 where the @xmath72 are the in - medium transition operators ( @xmath73-matrices ) for scattering from the @xmath74th nucleon , and @xmath75 is the in - medium pion propagator .",
    "what distinguishes this calculation from simpler folding models @xcite is the non - static treatment of the @xmath76 interaction , which is important because in the energy region of the @xmath57 resonance , the interaction between the pion and the nucleon varies strongly with pion - nucleon relative energy .",
    "also , the binding of the nucleons is taken into account via an approximate prescription .",
    "the predictions of this model have been compared with dcx data on @xmath6he @xcite and @xmath8he @xcite .",
    "here we extend the calculations to @xmath15li , and accordingly must modify the initial state wave function to take into account the presence of the @xmath13-shell proton and neutron .",
    "we describe the @xmath15li nucleus by a product of @xmath77 and @xmath78 harmonic oscillator wave functions : @xmath79 .",
    "the dcx amplitude is summed over the three possible sequences of first and second interactions : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath80 sequence is seen to contribute about 25% and the combined @xmath81 and @xmath82 sequences about 75% to the total amplitude @xcite .    in fig .",
    "13 we compare the results of this calculation with the measured doubly differential cross section at five angles for incident pion energy 240 mev , with two assumptions for the value of the average nuclear potentials @xmath83 and @xmath84 at the first and second scattering , respectively .",
    "the solid curves ( lower branches ) represent the calculation for @xmath85 mev ; the dashed curves ( lower branches ) that for @xmath86 .",
    "the sequential scattering model does indeed predict a high energy peak in the forward angle cross sections that is reasonably close , both in magnitude and in position in energy , to that seen in the data ; the evolution of this peak to larger angles is also quite well reproduced .",
    "whereas for @xmath6he and @xmath8he this calculation predicted a double - peaked spectrum at forward angles that agreed fairly well with the data , the inclusion of a @xmath13-shell nucleon seems to greatly diminish the low - energy peak , compared with the data .",
    "the question arises as to whether the primary origin of the observed low - energy peaks at 240 mev in the light @xmath13-shell dcx data is in fact pipp , as was suggested by alqadi and gibbs @xcite for dcx in @xmath8he .",
    "the upper branches of the solid and dashed curves were obtained by adding the estimated pipp cross sections from fig .  5 ( which assume a phase - space distribution ) to the calculated dcx cross sections .",
    "the agreement with the data is seen to be surprisingly good , and may be fortuitous , given the simplicity of the assumptions made for both dcx and pipp .",
    "the dcx calculations in fig .  13 show very little dependence on the nuclear potential .",
    "however , when the calculation is compared to the data at 25@xmath12 for incident energies 120 , 180 , and 240 mev ( fig .",
    "14 ) , we see that the choice of the potential has a significant effect . whereas the calculation for @xmath86 provides a fairly good representation of the magnitude of the cross section at all three energies , that for @xmath87 mev produces a prediction that is approximately three times too large at 180 mev and five times too large at 120 mev .",
    "the same phenomenon was seen in the comparison of this model with data on @xmath6he and @xmath8he : only by setting both potentials to zero could the magnitude of the predicted cross section be brought close to the data at 120 and 180 mev .",
    "a systematic study of the inclusive dcx process in light @xmath13-shell nuclei has been performed for incident pion energies between 120 mev and 240 mev .",
    "the relative magnitudes of the cross sections were found to be roughly consistent with a `` scaling rule''@xcite derived by assuming dcx to proceed via two sequential single charge exchange ( sscx ) reactions in competition with other processes .",
    "the data are compared with the predictions of two theoretical models : an intranuclear cascade model of oset and collaborators @xcite and a model developed by kinney @xcite based on the sscx mechanism .",
    "although one would expect the model of oset , which allows multiple interactions , to provide a better reproduction of the data , this does not appear to be the case .",
    "in particular , the strength at low outgoing pion energies , which one would expect to arise from multiple interactions , is calculated to be much larger than that seen in the data . either the effect of these interactions has been overestimated , or one or more of the approximations in this calculation has produced a distortion of the spectrum .",
    "the calculation of kinney @xcite provides an overall better representation of the data for @xmath15li , particularly if pipp is included .",
    "although a double - peaked structure in the forward angle spectra is expected if sscx is the dominant mechanism , the structure seen for @xmath15li and @xmath16li at 240 mev probably contains a contribution from pipp .",
    "we note that the data at 180 mev for these nuclei do not exhibit a low - energy peak .",
    "however , pipp can not provide the complete explanation , since for @xmath6he and @xmath8he the low - energy peak persists to energies well below the pipp threshold .",
    "we suggest that both sscx and pipp mechanisms are at work to produce pions of charge opposite to that of the incident beam .",
    "the double peak signature of sscx appears clearly in @xmath6he and @xmath8he owing to the simplicity of these nuclei .",
    "as @xmath52 increases , the presence of additional nucleons affords the possibility of more than two interactions , and `` washes out '' this structure .    in conclusion ,",
    "the work reported in this paper completes a systematic study of the @xmath52-dependence of the inclusive double charge exchange process at intermediate energies .",
    "results for lighter @xcite and heavier @xcite nuclei have been published previously .",
    "although many qualitative features of the inclusive dcx process are now fairly well understood , a quantitative theoretical description of the measured cross sections has yet to be achieved .",
