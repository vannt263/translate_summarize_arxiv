    "<S> einstein condensation ( bec ) has recently been realized in dilute vapours of spin  polarized alkali atoms , using advanced techniques for cooling and trapping@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these condensates consist of several thousands to several million atoms confined in a well which is generated from nonuniform magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the confining potential is accurately harmonic along the three cartesian directions and has cylindrical symmetry in most experimental setups .    </S>",
    "<S> the determination of thermodynamic properties such as the condensate fraction and the internal energy as functions of temperature is at present of primary interest in the study of these condensates@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of bec is fundamentally affected by the presence of the confining potential@xcite and finite size corrections are appreciable , leading for instance to a reduction in the critical temperature@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the correction to the transition temperature due to interactions has been recently computed by giorgini @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the condensate fraction was recently measured@xcite for a sample of around 40000 @xmath0rb atoms , the observed lowering in transition temperature being in agreement with theoretical predictions within experimental resolution . in the same work the internal energy was measured during ballistic expansion and found to be significantly higher in the bec phase than predicted by the ideal  gas model . while the increase is easily understood as a consequence of the interatomic repulsions , </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative estimate is still lacking .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we present a two  fluid mean  field model which is able to explain the above  mentioned effects , giving results in agreement with experiment for both the condensate fraction and the internal energy as functions of temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> we describe the condensate by means of the gross  pitaevskii ( gp ) equation for its wave function @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 being the scattering length , @xmath5 is the confining potential and @xmath6 is the average non  condensed particle distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath7 in the third term arises from exchange@xcite and we neglect the term involving the off  diagonal density of non  condensed particles . </S>",
    "<S> following bagnato @xcite we treat the non  condensed particles as non  interacting bosons in an effective potential @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> thermal averages are computed with a standard semiclassical bose  </S>",
    "<S> einstein distribution in chemical equilibrium with the condensate , i.e. at the same chemical potential @xmath9 . in particular , the density @xmath6 is @xmath10 we fix the chemical potential from the total number of particles @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 and the semiclassical density of states is @xmath14 this completes the self  consistent closure of the model </S>",
    "<S> .    equation ( [ eqgp ] ) can be solved analytically in the experimentally relevant situation @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 . except for a small region close to the phase transition </S>",
    "<S> the interaction parameter @xmath18 entering the gp equation is large and the kinetic energy can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> this yields @xmath19 where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) for @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the present strong  coupling solution neglects the condensate zero  point energy @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> as giorgini , pitaevskii and stringari@xcite pointed out finite  size effects are thereby excluded .    before presenting the complete numerical solution of the self  consistent model defined by equations ( [ eqserien1])([eqpsir ] ) and comparing its predictions with existing experimental data@xcite , we display perturbative solutions at zero and first  order .    an approximate semi </S>",
    "<S> analytical solution can be obtained by treating perturbatively interactions involving the `` dilute gas '' of non  condensed particles . to zero order in @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath26 and equation ( [ eqrhodef ] ) gives @xmath27 \\label{eqrhoc}\\ ] ] for @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the self  consistent zero  </S>",
    "<S> order solution is then completed by equation ( [ eqntot ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that no assumption of weak interactions _ within the condensate _ has been made .    </S>",
    "<S> we now proceed to compute the first order correction to the above zero  order solution . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath31 and expand equation ( [ eqrhodef ] ) to first order in @xmath32 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the choice of the expansion parameter @xmath32 $ ] ensures that the perturbative expansion is regular , since the correction to @xmath33 vanishes where the zero  order term vanishes . with the additional approximation @xmath34 in the first  order term </S>",

    "<S> order solution is then completed by equation ( [ eqntot ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we have solved numerically the simplified two  fluid model , first treating the parameter @xmath38 to all orders ( equations [ eqserien1][eqpsir ] ) , then to zero order ( equations [ eqntot ] and [ eqn0mu][eqn0sopratc ] ) and finally to first order ( equations [ eqntot ] and [ eqn0approx][eqrho1e ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> each case involves solving the integral equation ( [ eqntot ] ) to obtain @xmath9 as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath39 ; the non  perturbative solution also involves the local nonlinear problem posed by equations ( [ eqserien1 ] ) and ( [ eqpsir ] ) . the small differences between our three results justify _ a posteriori _ a perturbative treatment . </S>",
    "<S> experimental parameters are taken from the work of ensher @xcite : @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified numerically that our results depend weakly on @xmath11 in the region explored in the experiments and therefore have used a fixed @xmath41 in all our computations . </S>",
    "<S> we use as energy units the semiclassical ideal  gas critical temperature @xmath43 , @xmath44 being the riemann zeta function .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fign0 ] compares the temperature dependence of the condensate fraction @xmath45 with the experimental results of ensher @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lowering of the transition temperature due to interactions is clearly visible , even if the smoothness of our results around the transition prevents a precise assessment of an interaction  induced shift in @xmath46 from the numerical solution . it should be noticed that the strong  coupling solution of the gp equation is not valid for @xmath39 close to @xmath46 , since it requires @xmath47 , and that our mean field model does not include critical fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> both effects being relevant only in a narrow window around @xmath46@xcite , we expect our results to be meaningful in most of the temperature range . </S>",
    "<S> recently giorgini @xcite solved numerically the popov approximation to the finite  temperature generalization of the gp equation within a semiclassical wkb approximation . </S>",
    "<S> their results for the temperature dependence of the condensate fraction are in very good agreement with the predictions of our more naive model except for @xmath48 , where they find a sharp change in the slope of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> their result for the interaction  induced shift in critical temperature @xmath50 is also in good agreement with our curves .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ figeqst ] reports our results for the temperature dependence of the internal energy . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the experimentally measured quantity is the sum of the kinetic energy and of the interaction energy , not including the confinement potential energy due to the rapid switching off of the trapping potential@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the average single particle energy @xmath51 - 1\\right\\ } $ ] obtained from the semiclassical density of states contains twice the interaction energy , and  assuming that on average the kinetic and potential terms are equal  is twice the measured quantity . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy of condensed atoms is negligible in our strong  coupling limit and their interaction energy per particle is @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity directly comparable to the experimental data is therefore @xmath53 , which we plot in figure [ figeqst ] obtaining good agreement with the measured values . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated internal energy does not contain any sharp feature at transition , paralleling the result discussed above for the condensate fraction . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly the rapid rise in the specific heat is considerably smoothed with respect to the ideal  </S>",
    "<S> gas result ( see figure [ figcv ] ) . apart from this small region around transition , our results on @xmath54 above and below @xmath46 imply a significant reduction of the increase in specific heat across the phase transition .    in conclusion , we have presented a mean  field , semiclassical two  fluid model and discussed its perturbative and non  perturbative solution in the experimentally relevant parameter range . </S>",
    "<S> our results on the temperature dependence of the condensate fraction and of the internal energy are in agreement with recent experimental measurements , accounting for the pronounced increase in internal energy with respect to the noninteracting boson case measured below @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also verified that our model reproduces the results obtained for the condensate fraction with a more refined theory by giorgini . </S>"
