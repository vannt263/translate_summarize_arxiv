    "entanglement  @xcite , arguably the most spectacular and counterintuitive manifestation of quantum mechanics , is observed in composite quantum systems .",
    "it signifies the existence of non - local correlations between measurements performed on particles that have interacted in the past , but now are located arbitrarily far away .",
    "we say that a two - particle state @xmath1 is entangled , or non - separable , if it can not be written as a simple tensor product @xmath2 of two states which describe the first and the second subsystems , respectively , but only as a superposition of such states : @xmath3 . when two systems are entangled , it is not possible to assign them individual state vectors .",
    "the intriguing non - classical properties of entangled states were clearly illustrated by einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) in 1935  @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that quantum theory leads to a contradiction , provided that we accept ( i ) the reality principle : if we can predict with certainty the value of a physical quantity , then this value has physical reality , independently of our observation ;   is an eigenstate of an operator @xmath4 , namely , @xmath5 , then the value @xmath6 of the observable @xmath7 is , using the epr language , an element of physical reality . ]",
    "( ii ) the locality principle : if two systems are causally disconnected , the result of any measurement performed on one system can not influence the result of a measurement performed on the second system .",
    ", where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the space and time separations of the two events in some inertial reference frame and @xmath10 is the speed of light ( the two events take place at space - time coordinates @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) . ]",
    "the epr conclusion was that quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory .",
    "the suggestion was that measurement is in reality a deterministic process , which merely appears probabilistic since some degrees of freedom ( hidden variables ) are not precisely known .",
    "of course , according to the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics there is no contradiction , since the wave function is not seen as a physical object , but just as a mathematical tool , useful to predict probabilities for the outcome of experiments .",
    "the debate on the physical reality of quantum systems became the subject of experimental investigation after the formulation , in 1964 , of bell s inequalities  @xcite .",
    "these inequalities are obtained assuming the principles of realism and locality .",
    "since it is possible to devise situations in which quantum mechanics predicts a violation of these inequalities , any experimental observation of such a violation excludes the possibility of a local and realistic description of natural phenomena . in short",
    ", bell showed that the principles of realism and locality lead to experimentally testable inequality relations in disagreement with the predictions of quantum mechanics .",
    "many experiments have been performed in order to check bell s inequalities ; the most famous involved epr pairs of photons and was performed by aspect and coworkers in 1982  @xcite .",
    "this experiment displayed an unambiguous violation of a bell s inequality by tens of standard deviations and an excellent agreement with quantum mechanics .",
    "more recently , other experiments have come closer to the requirements of the ideal epr scheme and again impressive agreement with the predictions of quantum mechanics has always been found .",
    "nonetheless , there is no general consensus as to whether or not these experiments may be considered conclusive , owing to the limited efficiency of detectors .",
    "if , for the sake of argument , we assume that the present results will not be contradicted by future experiments with high - efficiency detectors , we must conclude that nature does not experimentally support the epr point of view . in summary ,",
    "the world is not locally realistic .",
    "i should stress that there is more to learn from bell s inequalities and aspect s experiments than merely a consistency test of quantum mechanics .",
    "these profound results show us that _ entanglement is a fundamentally new resource _ , beyond the realm of classical physics , and that it is possible to experimentally manipulate entangled states . a major goal of quantum information science  @xcite is to exploit this resource to perform computation and communication tasks beyond classical capabilities .",
    "entanglement is central to many quantum communication protocols , including quantum dense coding  @xcite , which permits transmission of two bits of classical information through the manipulation of only one of two entangled qubits , and quantum teleportation  @xcite , which allows the transfer of the state of one quantum system to another over an arbitrary distance .",
    "moreover , entanglement is a tool for secure communication  @xcite .",
    "finally , in the field of quantum computation entanglement allows algorithms exponentially faster than any known classical computation  @xcite . for any quantum algorithm operating on pure states , the presence of multipartite",
    "( many - qubit ) entanglement is necessary to achieve an exponential speedup over classical computation  @xcite .",
    "therefore the ability to control high - dimensional entangled states is one of the basic requirements for constructing quantum computers .",
    "random numbers are important in classical computation , as probabilistic algorithms can be far more efficient than deterministic ones in solving many problems  @xcite .",
    "randomness may also be useful in quantum computation .",
    "_ random pure states _ of dimension @xmath15 are drawn from the uniform ( haar ) measure on pure states   is the unique measure on pure @xmath15-level states invariant under unitary transformations .",

    ", it can be simply visualized as a uniform distribution on the _ bloch sphere _",
    "the generic state of a qubit may be written as @xmath17 where the states of the _ computational basis _",
    "@xmath18 are eigenstates of the pauli operator @xmath19 .",
    "the qubit s state can be represented by a point on a sphere of unit radius , called the bloch sphere .",

    "+ we also point out that ensembles of _ random mixed states _ are reviewed in  @xcite . ]",
    "the entanglement content of random pure quantum states is almost maximal  @xcite and such states find applications in various quantum protocols , like superdense coding of quantum states  @xcite , remote state preparation  @xcite , and the construction of efficient data - hiding schemes  @xcite .",

    "finally , random states may form the basis for a statistical theory of entanglement .",
    "while it is very difficult to characterize the entanglement properties of a many - qubit state , a simplified theory of entanglement might be possible for random states  @xcite .",
    "the preparation of a random state or , equivalently , the implementation of a random unitary operator mapping a fiducial @xmath0-qubit initial state , say @xmath22 , onto a typical ( random ) state , requires a number of elementary one- and two - qubit gates exponential in the number @xmath0 of qubits , thus becoming rapidly unfeasible when increasing @xmath0 . on the other hand , pseudo - random states approximating to the desired accuracy",
    "the entanglement properties of true random states may be generated efficiently , that is , polynomially in @xmath0  @xcite . in a sense ,",
    "pseudo - random states play in quantum information protocols a role analogous to pseudo - random numbers in classical information theory .",
    "random states can be efficiently approximated by means of random one- and two - qubit unitaries  @xcite or by deterministic dynamical systems ( maps ) in the regime of quantum chaos  @xcite .",
    "these maps are known to exhibit certain statistical properties of random matrices  @xcite and are efficient generators of multipartite entanglement among the qubits , close to that expected for random states  @xcite .",
    "note that in this case deterministic instead of random one- and two - qubit gates are implemented , the required randomness being provided by deterministic chaotic dynamics . a related crucial question , which i shall discuss in this review , is whether the generated entanglement is robust when taking into account unavoidable noise sources affecting a quantum computer . that is , decoherence or imperfections in the quantum computer hardware  @xcite , that in general turn pure states into mixtures , with a corresponding loss of quantum coherence and entanglement content .",
    "this paper reviews previous work concerning several aspects of the relationship between entanglement , randomness and chaos .",
    "in particular , i will focus on the following items : ( i ) the robustness of the entanglement generated by quantum chaotic maps when taking into account the unavoidable noise sources affecting a quantum computer ( sec .",
    "[ sec : stabilitymultipartite ] ) ; ( ii ) the detection of the entanglement of high - dimensional ( mixtures of ) random states , an issue also related to the question of the emergence of classicality in coarse grained quantum chaotic dynamics ( sec .",
    "[ sec : detect ] ) ; ( iii ) the decoherence induced by the coupling of a system to a chaotic environment , that is , by the entanglement established between the system and the environment ( sec .",
    "[ sec : chaoticenvironments ] ) . in order to make this paper accessible also to readers without a background in quantum information science and/or in quantum chaos , basic concepts and tools concerning bipartite and multipartite entanglement ,",
    "random and pseudo - random quantum states and quantum chaos maps are discussed in the remaining sections and appendixes .",
    "in this section , we show that _ for pure states _ @xmath1 a good measure of bipartite entanglement exists : the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrices . given a state described by the density matrix @xmath23 ,",
    "its von neumann entropy is defined as @xmath24 note that , here as in the rest of the paper , all logarithms are base @xmath25 unless otherwise indicated .",
    "first of all , a few definitions are needed :    _ entanglement cost _ : let us assume that two communicating parties , alice and bob , share many einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pairs  ] and that they wish to prepare a large number @xmath26 of copies of a given bipartite pure state @xmath1 , using only local operations and classical communication . if we call @xmath27 the minimum number of epr pairs necessary to accomplish this task , we define the entanglement cost as the limiting ratio @xmath28 , for @xmath29 .",
    "_ distillable entanglement _ : let us consider the reverse process ; that is , alice and bob share a large number @xmath26 of copies of a pure state @xmath1 and they wish to concentrate entanglement , again using only local operations supplemented by classical communication .",
    "if @xmath30 denotes the maximum number of epr pairs that can be obtained in this manner , we define the distillable entanglement as the ratio @xmath31 in the limit @xmath29 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath32 .",
    "otherwise , we could employ local operations and classical communication to create entanglement , which is a non - local , purely quantum resource ( it would be sufficient to prepare @xmath26 states @xmath1 from @xmath27 epr pairs and then distill @xmath33 epr states ) . furthermore , it is possible to show that , asymptotically in @xmath26 , the entanglement cost and the distillable entanglement coincide and that the ratios @xmath28 and @xmath31 are given by the reduced single - qubit von neumann entropies .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the von neumann entropies of the reduced density matrices @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the process that changes @xmath26 copies of @xmath1 into @xmath39 copies of @xmath40 is asymptotically reversible .",
    "moreover , it is possible to show that it is faithful ; namely , the change takes place with unit fidelity when @xmath29 . provides a measure of the distance between two , generally mixed , quantum states @xmath23 and",
    "@xmath41 : @xmath42 the fidelity of a pure state @xmath1 and an arbitrary state @xmath41 is given by @xmath43 which is the square root of the overlap between @xmath1 and @xmath41 . finally , the fidelity of two pure quantum states @xmath44 and @xmath45 is defined by @xmath46 , with @xmath47 when @xmath44 coincides with @xmath45 and @xmath48 when @xmath44 and @xmath45 are orthogonal .",
    "for further discussions on this quantity see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "the average fidelity between random states is studied in  @xcite . ]",
    "the proof of this result can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we can therefore quantify the entanglement of a bipartite pure state @xmath1 as @xmath49 it ranges from @xmath50 for a separable state to @xmath51 for maximally entangled two - qubit states ( the epr states ) .",
    "hence , it is common practice to say that the entanglement of an epr pair is @xmath51 _ ebit_.      the fact that @xmath52 is easily derived from the schmidt decomposition .    _ the schmidt decomposition theorem _ : given a pure state @xmath53 of a bipartite quantum system , there exist orthonormal states @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 such that @xmath58 with @xmath59 positive real numbers satisfying the condition @xmath60 ( for a proof of this theorem see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to stress that the states @xmath54 and @xmath56 depend on the particular state @xmath1 that we wish to expand .",
    "the reduced density matrices @xmath61 and @xmath62 have the same non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "their number is also the number @xmath39 of terms in the schmidt decomposition ( [ schmidtdec ] ) and is known as the _ schmidt number _ ( or the _ schmidt rank _ ) of the state @xmath1 . a separable pure state , which by definition can be written as @xmath63 has schmidt number equal to one .",
    "thus , we have the following entanglement criterion : a bipartite pure state is entangled if and only if its schmidt number is greater than one .",
    "for instance , the schmidt number of the epr state ( [ eprstate ] ) is @xmath25 .",
    "it is clear from the schmidt decomposition ( [ schmidtdec ] ) that @xmath64 if @xmath15 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 denote the dimensions of the hilbert spaces @xmath67 , @xmath55 and @xmath57 , with @xmath68 and @xmath69 , we have @xmath70 a maximally entangled state of two subsystems has @xmath65 equally weighted terms in its schmidt decomposition and therefore its entanglement content is @xmath71 ebits .",
    "for instance , the epr state ( [ eprstate ] ) is a maximally entangled two - qubit state .",
    "note that a maximally entangled state @xmath1 leads to a maximally mixed state @xmath72 .",
    "the purity of state described by the density matrix @xmath23 is defined as @xmath73 we have @xmath74 the purity is much easier to investigate analytically than the von neumann entropy .",
    "moreover , it provides the first non - trivial term in a taylor series expansion of the von neumann entropy about its maximum .",
    ", with @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we obtain @xmath77p(\\rho_a).\\ ] ] ] the purity ranges from @xmath78 for maximally entangled states to @xmath51 for separable states .",
    "one can also consider the _ participation ratio _ @xmath79 , which is the inverse of the purity .",
    "this quantity is bounded between @xmath51 and @xmath65 and is close to @xmath51 if a single term dominates the schmidt decomposition ( [ schmidtdec ] ) , whereas @xmath80 if all terms in the decomposition have the same weight ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the participation ratio @xmath82 represents the effective number of terms in the schmidt decomposition .",
    "a natural extension of the discussion of this section is to consider _ bipartite mixed states _ , @xmath83 @xmath84 ) , instead of pure states .",
    "however , mixed - state entanglement is not as well understood as pure - state bipartite entanglement and is the focus of ongoing research ( for a review , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    by definition , a ( generally mixed ) state",
    "is said to be separable if it can be prepared by two parties ( alice and bob ) in a `` classical '' manner ; that is , by means of local operations and classical communication .",
    "this means that alice and bob agree over the phone on the local preparation of the two subsystems @xmath7 and @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , a mixed state is separable if and only if it can be written as @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are density matrices for the two subsystems .",
    "a separable system always satisfies bell s inequalities ; that is , it only contains classical correlations .",
    "given a density matrix @xmath89 , it is in general a non - trivial task to prove whether a decomposition as in ( [ sepdecomposition ] ) exists or not  @xcite .",
    "we therefore need separability criteria that are easier to test .",
    "two useful tools for the detection of entanglement , the peres criterion and entanglement witnesses , are reviewed in appendix  [ app : separability ] .",
    "a simple argument helps understanding why the bipartite entanglement content of a pure random state @xmath1 is almost maximal . in a given basis @xmath90 the density matrix for the state @xmath91 is written as follows : @xmath92 where @xmath93 are the components of the state @xmath1 in the @xmath90 basis . in the case of a random state the components are uniformly distributed , with amplitudes @xmath94 and random phases . here",
    "@xmath15 is the hilbert space dimension and the value @xmath95 of the amplitudes ensures that the wave vector @xmath1 is normalized . the density matrix can therefore be written as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a @xmath98 zero diagonal matrix with random complex matrix elements of amplitude @xmath99 .",

    "the reduced von neumann entropy of subsystem @xmath7 is given by @xmath110 , the maximum entropy that the subsystem @xmath7 can have .",
    "the exact mean value @xmath111 of the bipartite entanglement is given by page s formula , obtained  @xcite by considering the ensemble of random pure states drawn according to the haar measure on @xmath112 : @xmath113 where @xmath114 denotes the ( ensemble ) average over the uniform haar measure .",
    "for @xmath115 , @xmath116 is close to its maximum value @xmath117 .",

    "remarkably , if we consider the _ thermodynamic limit _ , that is , we fix @xmath121 and let @xmath122 , then the reduced von neumann entropy concentrates around its average value ( [ epage ] ) .",

    "this observation implies , in particular , the concentration of the entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath72 around its average value  @xcite .",
    "this in turn implies that when the dimension @xmath15 of the quantum system is large it is meaningful to apply statistical methods and discuss typical ( entanglement ) behavior or random states , in the sense that almost all random states behave in essentially the same way .      for random states ,",
