    "one of the biggest ever discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental data was @xmath1 and @xmath2 production observed by cdf @xcite at the tevatron . with the recent development of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) fragmentation functions the experimental data can be accommodated within reasonable uncertainties . in the following",
    "i shall briefly describe the essence of pqcd fragmentation functions @xcite , then summarize @xmath0 meson production based on these pqcd fragmentation functions @xcite and the highlights of some recent activities on applying the pqcd fragmentation functions to explain anomalous @xmath1 and @xmath2 production @xcite .",
    "finally , i shall discuss a fragmentation model @xcite based on these pqcd fragmentation functions for the fragmentation of heavy quarks into heavy - light mesons , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this model is more attractive than previous fragmentation models since it is based on pqcd and the pqcd fragmentation functions have the correct heavy quark behavior .    in general , fragmentation of quarks and gluons",
    "lies in the nonperturbative regime so that the fragmentation functions can not be calculated from first principle .",
    "but there is a particular class of fragmentation functions , namely those for heavy quarks or gluons fragmenting into heavy - heavy bound - states , that is calculable in pqcd .",
    "heavy - heavy bound - states refer to heavy quarkonia , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 mesons .",
    "to visualize let us consider the hadronization of a heavy quark @xmath9 into a meson @xmath10 , which is schematically shown in fig .",
    "it is the lowest order 1-gluon exchange diagram that describes the hadronization process . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the central part is the creation of the quark - pair @xmath11 out of the vacuum , followed by the binding of @xmath12 to @xmath9 to form the meson @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the natural scale of this process is of order @xmath14 , specifically we choose it to be @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] could be used to picture the fragmentation of a heavy quark into a heavy - light meson when @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the natural scale is then equal to @xmath18 , which is close to @xmath19 , so that we do not expect the process to be calculable by pqcd .",
    "the nonperturbative physics involved demands a model calculation .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ fig1 ] can also be used to describe the production of @xmath7 , @xmath6 , and @xmath8 mesons when @xmath16 and @xmath20 .",
    "but the main difference is that the natural scale of the process is now of order @xmath21 , which is much larger than @xmath19 . in other words ,",
    "the fragmentation process can be reliably calculated as an expansion in @xmath22 . while the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] represents the lowest order @xmath23 term ; higher order corrections can be systematically calculated .",
    "the arguments for the calculability of gluon fragmentation into charmonium and bottomium within pqcd are essentially the same .",
    "even though we can calculate the fragmentation process by pqcd , there are bound - state effects that have to be taken care of .",
    "the nonperturbative bound - state effects can be parameterized by , _",
    "e.g. _ , wavefunctions or derivatives of wavefunctions of the bound - states at the origin . for the case of s - wave mesons",
    "there is only one nonperturbative parameter ",
    "@xmath24 , the wavefunction at the origin ; while for p - wave mesons there are two nonperturbative parameters , which correspond to the color - singlet and color - octet mechanisms .",
    "fragmentation into different spin - orbital states can be obtained by using the appropriate spin projections .",
    "the @xmath25 quark fragmentation functions can be calculated by this expression @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the mass of the meson , @xmath29 is the amplitude for producing a @xmath13 and @xmath30 from an off - shell @xmath31 with virtuality @xmath32 ( fig .",

    "@xcite , and the results for p - wave can be found in refs .",
    "the fragmentation functions for charm quark into charmonium can be obtained by putting @xmath42 in the above expressions , and can be found in ref .",

    "likewise , the photon and lepton fragmentation functions into charmonium were calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a couple of remarks about these pqcd fragmentation functions are in order .",
    "( i ) the scale of the pqcd fragmentation functions calculated should be of order of the heavy quark mass @xmath44 .",
    "we choose it to be @xmath45 , which is the minimum virtuality of the fragmenting quark . in the case of gluon fragmentation functions ,",
    "the scale is set at @xmath46 .",
    "these fragmentation functions obey the usual altarelli - parisi evolution equations such that fragmentation functions at higher scale can be obtained by evolving the altarelli - parisi equations .",
    "( ii ) the inputs to these pqcd fragmentation functions are simply the masses of charm and bottom quarks , and the wavefunctions at the origin ( also derivatives of the wavefunctions and color - octet wavefunctions for higher orbital states ) .",
    "all of these quantities can be reliably obtained from potential models or from lattice simulations .",
    "since the inputs can be reliably obtained from other sources , these pqcd fragmentation functions have high predictive power .    in sec .",
    "ii the fragmentation approach for calculating the @xmath0 meson production is described , and the same approach has been used to calculate the fragmentation contribution to the @xmath47 and @xmath2 production , as will be summarized in sec .",
    "iii . sec .",
    "iv describes a fragmentation model .",
    "the fragmentation approach has been used in calculating the fragmentation contribution to the production of @xmath48 , charmonium , and bottomium .",
    "this approach is based on factorization , in which the production process is separated into the production of high energy partons ( quarks and gluons ) and the fragmentation of these partons into the meson . in this section ,",
    "i summarize the results from a series of studies @xcite on the production rates of the s - wave and p - wave @xmath49 mesons , as well as , the inclusive production of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath49 mesons belong to another heavy - quark bound state family , which is made up of a @xmath50 antiquark and a @xmath51 quark .",
    "the spectroscopy for the spin - orbital states is similar to that of charmonium and bottomium , and @xmath49 can be obtained by interpolating between charmonium and bottomium .",
    "according to potential models @xcite , the 1s , 1p , 1d , 2s , and possibly the whole set of 2p states lie below the bd threshold .",
    "a very peculiar feature of the excited @xmath8 states is that the annihilation channel is suppressed relative to the electromagnetic or hadronic transitions into lower - lying states .",
    "therefore , when an excited state is produced it will cascade into the ground state with emission of photons and pions . hence , all the 1s , 1p , 1d , 2s , and probably 2p states contribute to the inclusive production of the ground state @xmath0 meson .",
    "the d - wave fragmentation functions are not available yet but they are expected to contribute only a very small fraction .",
    "the differential cross section for producing a @xmath49 meson in a spin - orbital state @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 \\ ; , \\label{*}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 s are the parton distribution functions , @xmath55 s are the subprocess cross sections , and @xmath56 s represent the parton fragmentation functions at the scale @xmath57 .",
    "the factorization scale @xmath57 is chosen in the order of the @xmath58 of the parton , so as to avoid large logarithms in @xmath55 , and the resulting large logarithms of order @xmath59 in @xmath56 can be summed by the altarelli - parisi equations .",
    "the gluon fragmentation functions at the initial scale are @xmath60 suppressed relative to the @xmath50 fragmentation functions , so we simply take the initial gluon fragmentation functions to be zero .",
    "this is justified since the majority of the gluon fragmentation comes from the altarelli - parisi evolution , and we called it the induced gluon fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath50 and gluon fragmentation functions into a @xmath49 state @xmath52 satisfy the following evolution equations @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 are the usual altarelli - parisi splitting functions .",
    "the initial conditions to the above equations are simply the initial @xmath50 fragmentation functions and the initial gluon fragmentation functions , which are set to zero .",
    "we can also examine the relative importance of these fragmentation functions .",
    "the initial @xmath64 is of order @xmath23 , even when it is evolved to a higher scale it is still of order @xmath23 . in contrast , the initial @xmath65 is of order @xmath66 , but at a higher scale @xmath57 it is of order @xmath67 via the altarelli - parisi evolution .",
    "therefore , at a sufficiently large scale the induced @xmath68 is as important as the @xmath50 quark fragmentation .",
    "the resulting @xmath58 spectra for the s - wave and p - wave states are shown in fig .",
    "we can now predict the inclusive production rate of the ground state @xmath0 meson .",
    "we add up the cross sections from all s - wave and p - wave production , and the inclusive cross sections of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath69 is shown in table [ table1 ] at the tevatron .",
    "variations with factorization scale between @xmath70 to @xmath71 , where @xmath72 , are also illustrated .",
    "the variation is at worst a factor of two , and substantially reduced at @xmath73 gev . with a production cross section of about 5 nb and 100 pb@xmath74 integrated luminosity at the tevatron",
    "there are about @xmath75 mesons .",
    "the detection mode for the @xmath0 meson will be @xmath76 , where @xmath77 can be a @xmath78 , @xmath79 , or @xmath80 , and @xmath1 can be detected easily through its leptonic decay modes .",
    "when @xmath77 is @xmath81 or @xmath82 , it will be a striking signature of three - charged leptons coming from a common secondary vertex .",
    "the combined branching ratio of @xmath83 is about 0.2% .",
    "this implies that there will be of order @xmath84 such distinct events for 100 pb@xmath74 luminosity at the tevatron .",
    "however , this mode does not afford the full reconstruction of the @xmath0 . if @xmath77 is some hadronic states , _",
    "e.g. _ , pions , the events can be fully reconstructed and the @xmath0 meson mass can be measured .",
    "the process @xmath85 is likely to be the discovery mode for @xmath0 .",
    "its combined branching ratio is about 0.03% , which implies about 300 such distinct events at the tevatron with a luminosity of 100 pb@xmath74 .",
    "the production rates of @xmath0 at the lhc will be of order @xmath86 with 100 fb@xmath74 luminosities , promising a very exciting experimental program on @xmath0 mesons at the lhc .",
    ".the inclusive production cross sections for the @xmath0 meson at the tevatron including the contributions from all the s - wave and p - wave states below the @xmath87 threshold as a function of @xmath88 .",
    "the acceptance cuts are @xmath89 gev and @xmath90 .",
    "[ table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there also exist complete @xmath91 calculations on the production of s - wave @xmath0 mesons @xcite .",
    "there is a controversy whether the fragmentation contribution will dominate the production of @xmath0 mesons at the large @xmath58 regions over the non - fragmentation ( recombination ) contribution .",
    "the controversy arises because the set of fragmentation diagrams is a gauge - invariant subset of the whole set of feynman diagrams at the order @xmath92 .",
    "so there is a competition between the fragmentation diagrams and the recombination diagrams .",
    "nevertheless , the bottom line is that the fragmentation approach identifies the correct scale for the fragmentation diagrams , and should give a lower bound on the production cross section of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "in this section , i highlight some recent activities on @xmath1 and @xmath2 production at the tevatron . before the recent cdf data @xcite , the dominant mechanism of @xmath1 production at high @xmath58 region was believed to be the fusion mechanism , @xmath93 , followed by the radiative decay of @xmath94 , while for @xmath2 production the dominant mechanism is @xmath95 because of the absence of @xmath96 states .",
    "but the cdf measurements on @xmath1 and @xmath2 exposed large discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental data .",
    "the discrepancies demonstrate that there must be either some other unknown production mechanisms or simply that perturbative qcd is not valid in this case .    in order",
    "that perturbative qcd is still the means to understand the production of heavy quarkonia , it is advantageous to consider higher order contributions , which are more important than the lowest order fusion mechanism .",
    "it was shown explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite that the contributions to @xmath1 and @xmath2 production from gluon , charm quark , and photon fragmentation are more important than the lowest order fusion mechanisms beyond certain values of @xmath58 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . ) among all the fragmentation contributions that are relevant to @xmath1 production , the largest one comes from gluon fragmentation into @xmath97 followed by the radiative decay @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "the gluon fragmentation @xmath99 consists of two pieces , one of which is the color - singlet part of order @xmath23 and the other piece is the color - octet part of order @xmath60 .",
    "when the fragmentation contributions are included , the theoretical prediction matches the experimental data within a factor of 2  3 @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , which is within the uncertainties from the mass of charm quark , the factorization scale , higher order qcd corrections , and relativistic corrections .",
    "while anomalous @xmath1 production seems to be solved , however , the data for @xmath2 production is still a factor of 20  30 above the theoretical prediction , even after including the fragmentation contributions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath96 states are predicted to be above the @xmath100 threshold and therefore do not contribute to @xmath2 production .",
    "this discrepancy is sometimes referred as the @xmath2 anomaly .",
    "of course , there have been speculative solutions to the anomaly .",
    "the most obvious solution is the hypothesis that @xmath96 states are metastable such that they decay with appreciable branching ratios into @xmath2 @xcite . according to potential models , the @xmath96 states are above the @xmath100 threshold , but the decay of @xmath101 might be suppressed due to a d - wave suppression .",
    "therefore , an appreciable fraction of @xmath96 can decay into @xmath2 . in order to explain the @xmath2 anomaly ,",
    "a branching ratio @xmath102% is needed .",
    "however , such a large branching ratio is unflavored by potential models .",
    "there is also another mechanism due to braaten and fleming @xcite , who proposed that the production is via gluon fragmentation into a color - octet @xmath103 state , which then nonperturbatively emits a pair of gluons to make the transition into @xmath2 state .",
    "this mechanism is suppressed by powers of @xmath104 , which is the relative velocity between @xmath51 and @xmath105 inside the charmonium .",
    "but on the other hand , this fragmentation is flavored by two powers of @xmath60 compared to the color - singlet fragmentation function ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "it means that this fragmentation mechansim could be potentially large because the corresponding fragmentation function is only of order @xmath60 , though suppressed by powers of @xmath104 .",
    "the major uncertainty is the determination of the nonperturbative parameter associated with the soft emission of the gluon - pair in color - octet @xmath106 state .",
    "this mechanism can be tested rather easily because the @xmath2 produced will be entirely transversely polarized @xcite , and the polarization can be easily measured experimentally by looking at the angular distribution of the muon pair in the decay of @xmath2 .",
    "if this mechanism is tested to be important , it will significantly affect all hadro- , photo- , and electro- production of charmonium .",
    "in fact , a very recent analysis indicated that only about one third of the prompt @xmath1 comes from @xmath97 decays , while the rest is from direct @xmath1 production .",
    "it means that there is another important production mechanism other than the gluon fragmentation into @xmath97 s followed by the radiative decay of @xmath97 s into @xmath1 .",
    "this might be the hint showing the importance of braaten - fleming s color - octet mechanism @xcite in @xmath1 production as well .",
    "in this section i describe a fragmentation model @xcite for the fragmentation of heavy quarks into heavy - light mesons .",
    "this model is based on the pqcd fragmentation functions that are presented in eqs .",
    "( [ dz1 ] ) and ( [ dz2 ] ) for s - wave mesons , and in ref .",
    "@xcite for p - wave mesons .",
    "but since most of the experimental data are on s - wave states , i concentrate on eqs .",
    "( [ dz1])([dz2 ] ) .",
    "let me rewrite the fragmentation functions here : @xmath107 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath108 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath109 , instead of being given in terms of the wavefunction and the running coupling constant , is now treated as a free parameter governing the overall normalization together with another free parameter @xmath110 , @xmath110 being the mass ratio @xmath111 .",
    "this model , in the limit @xmath112 , approaches the fragmentation of a very heavy quark into a heavy - light meson . in reality , the heavy quark is either @xmath113 or @xmath51 , and the light component is @xmath114 , @xmath115 , or @xmath116 , and therefore @xmath110 is a small parameter . in principle , when the lighter constituent quark becomes a light quark , there is that nonperturbative physics involved in the fragmentation process .",
    "but we do expect our pqcd fragmentation functions with @xmath109 and @xmath110 as free parameters can at least provide a qualitative picture and hence a reasonable model for fragmentation into heavy - light mesons .",
    "this model is suitable for @xmath117 , ... and @xmath118 , ... mesons .",
    "this fragmentation model has certain advantages over previous models @xcite in the literature .",
    "first of all , this model lies on a firm basis of pqcd .",
    "it is rigorously correct in the limit when @xmath119 and higher order corrections can be systematically calculated .",
    "the spirit of our model is the continuation of @xmath14 to a value close to @xmath19 .",
    "the most obvious advantage of this model is the ability to predict different results for different spin - orbital states with only two parameters , in contrast to the peterson model .",
    "another advantage is that the fragmentation functions for the same orbital angular momentum share the same paramter @xmath109 , as shown in eqs  ( [ model ] )  ( [ model1 ] ) .",
    "this is a substantial improvement when ratios of the fragmentation functions are measured , in which the @xmath109 dependence cancels out .",
    "for example , our model can predict the ratio @xmath120 as a function of @xmath110 only , where @xmath121 is the vector meson and @xmath122 is the pseudoscalar .",
    "another theoretical issue is that the pqcd fragmentation functions are consistent with heavy quark symmetry , which i explain in more detail next .",
    "according to an analysis using the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite , the fragmentation function for a heavy quark @xmath9 into a hadron @xmath123 containing a single heavy quark @xmath9 at the heavy quark mass scale @xmath44 is @xmath124 which is a heavy quark mass expansion in @xmath125 and @xmath126 is a rescaled variable of @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "the leading term is of order @xmath129 , i.e. , @xmath44 , while the next - to - leading term is of order @xmath130 .",
    "the pqcd fragmentation functions in eqs .",
    "( [ model ] ) and ( [ model1 ] ) can be expanded in powers of @xmath110 and reexpressed in terms of @xmath126 , as @xmath131 the above expansions in powers of @xmath110 are consistent with the hqet analysis @xcite that the leading term is order @xmath129 .",
    "actually , if examined more carefully , the leading terms of the @xmath132 and @xmath133 expressions are exactly in the ratio of 1:3 , which is the value predicted by heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "the next - to - leading terms are not in the ratio of 1:3 , and they explicitly break the spin symmetry .",
    "this fact also prompted us to derive the pqcd fragmentation functions independently from the hqet lagrangian @xcite . by using the leading and the next - to - leading terms of the hqet lagrangian , we succeeded in obtaining the same results as the heavy quark mass expansions in eqs .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) .",
    "therefore , with the consistency with heavy quark symmetry and hqet we have more confidence in applying our pqcd fragmentation functions as a fragmentation model for heavy quark fragmenting into heavy - light mesons , namely , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , ... when more data on p - wave mesons are available , comparisons with the p - wave fragmentation functions can also be made .",
    "for the moment the data are more or less entirely on the s - wave states .",
    "i shall demonstrate a couple of comparisons between the predictions by this model and the experimental data .",
    "we shall look at @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "\\(a ) @xmath136 for the charm system is defined as @xmath138 , which is a measure of the population of @xmath139 in a sample of @xmath140 and @xmath139 mesons .",
    "since fragmentation is the dominant production mechanism for charm mesons and @xmath141 mesons dominate , @xmath136 can be expressed in terms of the fragmentation functions @xmath142 which is a function of @xmath110 only .",
    "the prediction by the pqcd fragmentation model is shown by the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . at @xmath143 , the heavy quark mass limit , @xmath144 , which is exactly the value given by the naive spin counting . at @xmath145 @xmath136 is always smaller than 0.75 , which implies that @xmath139 is produced less than given by heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the mass splitting between @xmath140 and @xmath139 mesons , which can be accounted for by the @xmath146 term in the hqet .",
    "a compilation of data on @xmath136 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the updated branching ratio @xmath147 was used , and the average @xmath148 .",
    "this value of @xmath136 also indicates that @xmath139 mesons are produced less than it should be as given by heavy quark spin symmetry . for the charm",
    "quark we take @xmath149 gev and the light constituent quark mass to be 0.3 gev , therefore @xmath150 .",
    "the data is then plotted on the graph and very good agreement is obtained . recently , the data for @xmath151 system has also been available with @xmath152 @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath153 gev and @xmath154 gev again , therefore @xmath155 .",
    "the prediction is still less than 1@xmath156 from the data point . from the figure",
    "we can see that if we choose a smaller value of @xmath157 , say 0.2 gev , we could even get a better agreement .",
    "the errors in @xmath136 certainly allow us to vary @xmath157 more than 0.15 gev such that the prediction is still within @xmath158 . or , we can use the experimental value of @xmath136 to fix the parameter @xmath110 .",
