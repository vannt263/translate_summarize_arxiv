    "<S> it has been found that the s@xmath0f instability exhibits the nucleation nature : only when a speed peak amplitude is large enough , the s@xmath0f instability occurs ; in contrast , speed peaks of smaller amplitudes cause dissolving speed waves of a local increase in speed ( dissolving acceleration waves ) in synchronized flow . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the s@xmath0f instability governs traffic breakdown  a phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow ( f@xmath0s transition ) at the bottleneck : the nucleation nature of the s@xmath0f instability explains the metastability of free flow with respect to an f@xmath0s transition at the bottleneck . </S>"
