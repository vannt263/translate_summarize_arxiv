    "the study of the dynamics of suspensions of charged particles is interesting both because of the subtle physics underlying many electrokinetic phenomena and because of the practical relevance of such phenomena for the behavior of many synthetic and biological complex fluids  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "electrokinetic effects can be used to control the transport of charged and uncharged molecules and colloids , using electrophoresis , electro - osmosis , and related phenomena  @xcite .",
    "as micro - fluidic devices become ever more prevalent , there are an increasing number of applications of electro - viscous phenomena that can be exploited to selectively transport material in devices with mesoscopic dimensions  @xcite .    in virtually all cases of practical interest ,",
    "electroviscous phenomena occur in confined systems of a rather complex geometry .",
    "this makes it virtually hopeless to apply purely analytical modeling techniques . but also from a molecular - simulation point of view electroviscous effects present a formidable challenge .",
    "first of all , the systems under consideration always contain at least three components ; namely a solvent plus two ( oppositely charged ) species .",
    "then , there is the problem that the physical properties of the systems of interest are determined by a number of potentially different length scales ( the ionic radius , the bjerrum length , the debye - hckel screening length and the characteristic size of the channels in which transport takes place ) . as a result ,",
    "fully atomistic modeling techniques become prohibitively expensive for all but the simplest problems .",
    "conversely , standard discretization of the macroscopic transport equations is ill suited to deal with the statistical mechanics of charge distributions in ionic liquids , even apart from the fact that such techniques are often ill - equipped to deal with complex boundary conditions .    in this context ,",
    "application of mesoscopic ( `` coarse - grained '' ) models to the study of electrokinetic phenomena in complex fluids seem to offer a powerful alternative approach .",
    "such models can be formulated either by introducing effective forces with dissipative and random components , as in the case of dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd )  @xcite , or by starting from simplified kinetic equations , as is the case with the lattice - boltzmann method ( lb ) .",
    "the problem with the dpd approach is that it necessarily introduces an additional length scale ( the effective size of the charged particles ) .",
    "this size should be much smaller than the debye screening length , because otherwise real charge - ordering effects are obscured by spurious structural correlations ; hence , a proper separation of length scales may be difficult to achieve . a lattice - boltzmann model for electroviscous effect",
    "was proposed by warren  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the densities of the ( charged ) solutes are treated as passive scalar fields .",
    "forces on fluid element are mediated by these scalar fields .",
    "a different approach was followed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where solvent and solutes are treated on the same footing ( namely as separate species ) .",
    "this method was then extended to couple the dynamics of charged colloids to that of the electrolyte solution . as we shall discuss below",
    ", both approaches have practical drawbacks that relate to the mixing of discrete and continuum descriptions .",
    "the lb model that we introduce below appears at first sight rather similar to the model proposed by warren .",
    "however , the underlying philosophy is rather different .",
    "we propose to consider the _ fluxes _  between connected nodes as the basic physical quantities that determine the evolution of local densities .",
    "such a formulation ensures local mass conservation , does not rely on fluxes or gradients computed at the lattice nodes ( which constitutes a source of error in other models due to the need to approximate them on a lattice ) , and by choosing a symmetric formulation for the link fluxes in terms of the nodes that are affected , we can recover the proper equilibrium without spurious fluxes .",
    "our model relies on an lb formulation for mixtures .",
    "hence , the improvements of the formulation based on link fluxes will overcome some of the limitation of previous lb models for mixtures based on gradient expansions of a free energy  @xcite .",
    "the method described is very flexible , and in particular general boundary conditions are easily implemented .",
    "this feature makes also the proposed formulation attractive , since it avoids problems related to mass and charge conservation at fluid - solid interfaces , an artifact that has plagued previous lb implementations .",
    "it is then possible to model the dynamics of colloidal particles and polyelectrolytes in solution .",
    "the electrostatic interaction between them is derived from the charge distribution in the fluid .",
    "hence , we do not need to assume any specific form for the interaction between charged colloids , or between monomers in a polyelectrolyte .",
    "electro - osmosis , the sedimentation potential , electrophoresis or other electrokinetic phenomena can be easily treated within the model . in this paper",
    "we consider the first two to illustrate the capabilities of the method .",
    "the electrolyte is treated at the poisson - boltzmann level .",
    "we are not restricted to the linearized debye - hckel regime and can study the electrokinetic effects at high charge densities , being only limited by ionic condensation ( as happens for example in cylinders ) .",
    "the model we introduce will miss effects due to charge correlations .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the hydrodynamics of fluid mixtures to set the general background . in section 3",
    "we describe the proposed numerical method and subsequently , in section 4 , we discuss how to model general solid interfaces within this lattice model .",
    "section 5 focuses on the special case of interest to treat electrokinetic phenomena . in section 6",
    "we validate the method by analyzing different situations of interest , including electro - osmosis and sedimentation .",
    "in some respects , the dynamics of electrolytes at hydrodynamic scales is analogous to that of multicomponent mixtures .",
    "the simplest electrolyte model consists of two ionic species and a neutral solvent . in order to provide the general framework for the description of electrolyte dynamics , we first briefly review the dynamics of mixtures on hydrodynamic length and time scales . as in all hydrodynamic descriptions , the starting point of any discussion are the laws of conservation of mass and momentum .",
    "every species of the fluid mixture satisfies the usual mass conservation law : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the velocity and @xmath2 the density distribution of the species labeled by @xmath3 . the total density , @xmath4 , is also conserved , and satisfies an equation analogous to eq .",
    "( [ single species mass conservation ] ) with respect to the barycentric velocity @xmath5 , which describes the evolution of a fluid element .",
    "if we refer the motion of all species to this common velocity , then eq .",
    "( [ single species mass conservation ] ) can be expressed as @xmath6 where we have introduced the relative current of species @xmath7 , @xmath8 , which accounts for all dynamical effects arising from the mismatch in velocities between the different species .",
    "on very short time scales , such currents are controlled by friction relaxation . however , for mixtures composed of molecular constituents ( as is usually the case in electrolytes ) , the inertial time scale is extremely small ; hence the relative current can be assumed proportional to a thermodynamic driving force , which is proportional to the gradient of the chemical potential . as a result , the relative current of species @xmath9 becomes diffusive and can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the boltzmann constant and @xmath14 the inverse temperature .",
    "@xmath15 is the chemical potential decomposed in an ideal and excess part , while @xmath16 corresponds to the diffusion coefficient that determines the flux of species @xmath9 induced by spatial variations in the chemical potential of species @xmath7 . for the sake of simplicity , we concentrate on the case where cross diffusion is neglected , and hence @xmath17 . by substituting the chemical potential in eq .",
    "( [ diffusive current ] ) , we can then express mass conservation in the form of a set of convection - diffusion equations , expressing the two mechanisms that control density evolution for each species , @xmath18 .\\ ] ]      next , we consider momentum conservation . on the same length and time scales , momentum conservation implies that the barycentric velocity follows the navier - stokes equation , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the shear and bulk fluid viscosities , respectively , while @xmath22 is the external force acting on a fluid element .",
    "the effect of the interactions among the different species enters as a net force expressed as the gradient of the local pressure , @xmath23 . in the presence of spatial gradients ,",
    "the pressure has in general a tensorial character , and can be derived from the free energy of the system .",
    "however , for ideal electrolytes , the local pressure can always be expressed as a scalar .",
    "hence , for the sake of simplicity we will consider this situation in what follows . as a result",
    ", we only need to input the free energy of the mixture to determine both the pressure and chemical potentials .",
    "specifically , if we know the free energy per unit volume @xmath24+\\beta f^{ex}$ ] , then @xmath25 where the free energy , the chemical potential and the pressure are position dependent .",
    "the first term of the pressure corresponds to the ideal - gas contribution , @xmath26 while the other two contain all the information of the interactions among the fluid species .",
    "if there is one majority neutral component , which only contributes to the ideal part of the pressure , then the excess component of the pressure can be identified as the osmotic pressure of the mixture . in general",
    ", the pressure gradient follows from gibbs - duhem , @xmath27 and acts as a force .",
    "we will use this interpretation in the lb implementation discussed in the next section .    using the last expression for the pressure gradient",
    ", the navier - stokes equation reads @xmath28",
    "we propose a model that combines a description of momentum dynamics based on lattice - boltzmann , with a numerical description of the convection - diffusion equation .",
    "quantities are defined on the nodes of a lattice , @xmath29 , and time evolves in discrete time steps .",
    "the lattice is prescribed by specifying its connectivity .",
    "the connections of each node are determined by specifying the set of allowed velocities , @xmath30 , where the sub - index @xmath9 runs over all the allowed velocities .",
    "then , each node @xmath29 is connected to the nodes @xmath31 .      for convenience ,",
    "let us rewrite the convection - diffusion equation , eq .",
    "( [ smoluchowski ] ) , in the form @xmath32 where the diffusive flux is @xmath33 for the sake of clarity , we discuss separately the change in density of the species @xmath3 due to diffusion and to advection .",
    "the total change in time of the density is simply the sum of the two contributions .",
    "let us assume for the time being that the mixture diffuses in a fluid at rest .",
    "( [ smolu solution ] ) then becomes @xmath34 integrating both sides of this equation over a volume @xmath35 and using the green s formula @xmath36 , we obtain : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the outward unity vector normal to the surface , @xmath39 , enclosing the volume @xmath40 .",
    "as we have pointed out previously , we will consider densities defined on nodes of a lattice and the time evolution evolves at constant time steps . in this case , we can identify the volume @xmath40 with the volume associated to that node , and @xmath39 is related to the connectivity of the lattice nodes .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ `` green '' ] ) states that the change of the total number of particles enclosed in the volume corresponding to node @xmath29 equals the sum of the outward fluxes .",
    "such fluxes can only take place by mass transport to the neighboring nodes that are connected to the central node , according to the structure of the predetermined lattice connectivity .",
    "hence , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of particles of species @xmath7 at node @xmath43 , while @xmath44 accounts for the fraction of particles of species @xmath7 going to node @xmath31 . if we consider the velocity moving opposite to @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath45 , we have @xmath46 because these fluxes are always defined considering that the particles move away from the reference node .",
    "this unambiguously show that the fluxes are related to the links joining the connected nodes , rather than being quantities defined on the nodes .",
    "it is worth noting that in the previous balance equation the relevant quantity is the number of particles of species @xmath7 at node @xmath29 , @xmath47 , rather than its number density , @xmath48 . if we take the volume of a cell as our unit of volume , then @xmath49 .",
    "however , in the presence of solid boundaries this distinction may become relevant .",
    "the prefactor @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ discrete smolu ] ) is related to the geometrical structure of the lattice .",
    "rather than connecting it directly with the area of the wigner - seitz cell that can be associated to node @xmath29 , we derive its magnitude by computing how density diffuses to the neighboring nodes . in section  [ sec : effective diffusion ] we will compute explicitly this geometric prefactor for a particular lattice . in the following , when referring to link mobility , we will use the symbol @xmath51 .",
    "using link fluxes to compute the variation of the densities of the different species avoids approximating the divergence on a lattice , a source of lattice artifacts , and the related potential spurious fluxes that may appear .",
    "moreover , the use of these link fluxes also imposes locally mass conservation to machine accuracy , avoiding the errors caused by the discretization of the spatial gradient operator .",
    "we must still provide a prescription to implement the diffusive fluxes .",
    "these are in principle given by eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) and involve spatial gradients between two neighboring lattice nodes . in equilibrium ,",
    "@xmath52 $ ] and , as a consequence , eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) predicts that all diffusive fluxes vanish .",
    "however , the direct implementation of eqn .",
    "( [ flux ] ) on a lattice will suffer from discretization errors that will result in small but noticeable spurious fluxes . to eliminate this effect , it is convenient to write the expression for the flux on a link as @xmath53.\\ ] ] because , in this expression , the gradient becomes identically zero when the density distribution corresponds to its equilibrium form .",
    "this also holds for the discretized form to be discussed below .",
    "consistent with the idea that the flux can be expressed in terms of link mass fluxes , we propose a symmetrized implementation of @xmath54 involving magnitudes defined in the two connected nodes , @xmath29 and @xmath55 .",
    "in particular , we write the flux of species @xmath7 along the link @xmath56 as @xmath57,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the distance between the two neighboring nodes .",
    "this symmetrized formulation ensures that , to machine accuracy , @xmath59 , and mass is conserved for the model elementary dynamic processes .",
    "note that , based on the mass conservation expression , eq .",
    "( [ discrete smolu ] ) , the global mass change of node @xmath29 is the sum of the link fluxes , @xmath54",
    ". mass evolution in the diffusive limit is described only on the basis of mass flux divergence , as we have described . in general , the procedure developed based on link fluxes provides a consistent framework to obtain other gradients if needed .      local density",
    "can also be altered due to advection if there is a local velocity of the fluid .",
    "if , for the time being , we disregard diffusion , the advection mechanisms can be written in the form , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the barycentric fluid velocity . in principle , the change in the number of particles could be computed on the basis of the advection along each link , in a way similar to eq .",
    "( [ discrete smolu ] ) .",
    "however , as we will describe in the next section , the model we will introduce provides the velocity at each node , rather than the link velocity . in order to avoid numerical artifacts and spurious diffusion due to the interpolation to get such a link velocity",
    ", we propose an alternative implementation of the advection process .",
    "we still consider that @xmath47 give us the number of particles in a volume element centered around node @xmath29 .",
    "since we know the velocity of that node , @xmath62 , in one step the node will _ virtually _ displace to @xmath63 . as a result ,",
    "the volume associated to node @xmath29 will intersect some neighboring cells of the real lattice ( see fig.[fig1:advection ] ) . we then distribute the amount of particles @xmath64 into the intersected volumes proportionally to the intersected region . in fig .",
    "[ fig1:advection ] , we depict in shadow the volumes that correspond to the fraction of the density that is transported in the new cells .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it greatly reduces the spurious diffusion that usually results during advection in lattice models . to be more precise , even with the present method",
    ", advection will cause some spurious diffusion ( proportional to the flow velocity ) .",
    "however , in section  [ sec : effective diffusion ] we show that , in practice , this effect is negligible .      in order to simulate the hydrodynamic flow of the fluid , we make use of the lattice - boltzmann approach .",
    "this technique has been used extensively to model hydrodynamic flows in complex geometries  @xcite .",
    "it is equivalent to solving a discretized version of the boltzmann equation with a linearized collision operator .",
    "this method describes the dynamics of a fluid in terms of the densities of particles that `` live '' on the nodes of a cubic lattice and have discrete velocities @xmath65 , where @xmath9 labels the links between a lattice point @xmath29 and its neighbors .",
    "the values of the velocities are chosen such that , in one time step , a particle moves along a link from one lattice node to its neighbor . in the lattice - boltzmann model ,",
    "the unit of length is equal to the lattice spacing and the unit of time is equal to the time step .",
    "in addition , the unit of mass ( or , equivalently , energy ) is fixed by the requirement that , in the continuum limit , the transport equations for the lattice model approach the navier - stokes equation .",
    "this imposes a relation between the temperature and the speed of sound ( see below eq .",
    "[ n - s ideal ] ) .",
    "the central dynamic quantity in the lattice - boltzmann approach is the one - particle distribution function , @xmath66 , which describes the probability of having a particle at site @xmath43 at time @xmath67 with velocity @xmath68 .",
    "the hydrodynamic variables are obtained as moments of this distribution function over the lattice velocities , @xmath56 ; e.g. density and momentum can be obtained as @xmath69 respectively .    in the presence of external forces , @xmath70",

    "hence , one needs to specify the equilibrium distribution as well as the collision operator .",
    "the collision operator ensures mass and momentum conservation ( i.e. @xmath74 ) .",
    "its eigenvalues also determine the viscosity of the fluid . the equilibrium distribution appearing in eq .",

    "are chosen to ensure that the anisotropy of the lattice does not affect the hydrodynamic behavior of the model , as well as ensuring that all the distribution functions are non negative .",
    "moreover , @xmath78 is the speed of sound and its value depends on the values of the coefficients @xmath77 , but it is always smaller than unity ( in lattice units ) . finally , the term @xmath79 accounts for the external force .",
    "it satisfies @xmath80 and @xmath81 . for a more detailed description of how to model the external force ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that in the hydrodynamic limit one recovers the navier - stokes equation @xmath82 since the third term on the rhs is the pressure gradient for an ideal gas , if we fix the temperature such that @xmath83 , we then recover eq .",
    "( [ general navier - stokes ] ) for an ideal mixture . for non - ideal mixtures",
    ", we will introduce the missing contribution to the pressure gradients as a local external force , @xmath70 .    introducing the mixture non - ideality as a local effective force implies that the fluid reacts with the appropriate susceptibility to applied external fields , although in the absence of spatial gradients the equilibrium distribution corresponds to that of an ideal gas .",
    "since we are not concerned with local structure , the model can be regarded as an effective kinetic model , similar in structure to a linearized vlasov equation .",
    "hence , this approach differs from previous proposals which try to derive the hydrodynamics of non - ideal mixtures from kinetic models of mixtures@xcite or from a modification of the equilibrium distribution to recover the equilibrium pressure@xcite .    for a particular choice of the shear viscosity , @xmath84 in lattice units  @xcite , the general dynamic rule eq .",
    "( [ lb1 ] ) simplifies to , @xmath85.\\ ] ] for the sake of convenience , we implement the model with this simplified updating rule .",
    "however , it is straightforward to implement the more general form that allows us to impose other values of the viscosity .",
    "the peculiarities of the non - ideality of the mixture enters through the forcing term ( @xmath70)in eq .  ( [ eta16 ] ) .",
    "this forcing term can be decomposed into an external field and an interaction contributions , @xmath86 .",
    "this interaction force , as previously described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gibbsduhem ] ) , has the form @xmath87 . using the same approach that we have used to model the convection - diffusion equation , we can determine the force acting on each link , @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , for the particular case where the diffusion matrix is diagonal , @xmath89.\\ ] ] the advantage of using the force exerted on the links is that again , we keep a symmetric dependence on the neighboring nodes , and moreover @xmath90 . yet , in the lattice - boltzmann update rule , we need the force acting on the node .",
    "this force can be obtained averaging the link forces , @xmath91    let us now introduce an alternative way of treating the same systems .",
    "there are situations , as is the case in electrolytes , where one of the components of the mixture is dominant , and plays the role of the solvent . in this case , we can single out this component , @xmath92 , and treat it separately from the rest . in particular , since @xmath93 , we can approximate the overall density by the solvent density ( @xmath94 ) , and the overall momentum by the solvent momentum ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "if we then relate the moments of the distribution function @xmath96 to the solvent density , i.e. @xmath97 and @xmath98 instead of eqs .",
    "( [ rholb ] ) , we impose a constant solvent density in the incompressible regime .",
    "hence , the rest of the components will need to compensate their densities to avoid any net local density variation .",
    "although this incompressibility constraint is not exact , it may be a convenient approximation . from the point of view of the link force , eq .",
    "( [ eq : flink ] ) , it has the computational advantage that one gets @xmath99 and it reduces to the link diffusive flux previously computed , eq .",
    "( [ linkflux ] ) . in this case",
    "the navier - stokes equation becomes @xmath100+{\\bf f}^{ext},\\ ] ] and by taking @xmath101 , we recover an appropriate behavior when @xmath102 .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that densities of different species are dealt with on different footing , which may prove advantageous in certain applications , specially when dealing with boundary conditions that act differently on the solvent and solute , as it is the case if dealing with semipermeable membranes .",
    "numerically , in this case there is a net force only when the density distribution deviates from its local equilibrium value , in contrast with the original method , where the density coming from the advection contribution balances the local force .",
    "this ensures an additional way to avoid spurious artifacts from the underlying lattice .",
    "if the fluid mixture is confined between walls , or if colloids are added to the mixture , we need to specify how the densities and distribution function will interact with solid interfaces . to account",
    "fully for such an interaction , we need to describe in turn how the distribution function behaves , how the particle number evolves , and how we estimate the interacting force at the surface .    at a solid surface",
    "we expect hydrodynamic `` stick '' boundary conditions to apply . one way to impose these is to apply the so - called `` bounce - back rule '' on the links .",
    "however , the standard version of this procedure ( see for example ladd  @xcite ) allows the fluid to leak into the solid . although this leakage is usually innocuous , there are cases ( a typical example being when electrostatics is part of the excess chemical potential ) where this leakage may change the density of the solvent inside the solid , leading to a corresponding error in the pressure gradient .",
    "there exist alternative bounce - back rules that do not allow for any fluid leakage  @xcite .",
    "the formulation of our model in terms of link fluxes simplifies the implementation of boundary conditions for the fluxes of the different species densities , @xmath103 .",
    "since the convection - diffusion equation involves only mass conservation , it is enough to impose that there is no net flux on any link that joins a fluid node and a solid node .",
    "we accomplish this by imposing that the diffusive flux @xmath104 on such a link , and that the flux due to advection also vanishes .",
    "this second requirement is achieved by a kind of partial bounce - back move : the number of particles that would have been assigned to a solid node after advection is reflected back to its node of origin .    the updating rule , both for the number densities of the convection - diffusion equations and for the lattice boltzmann distribution function , requires the evaluation of gradients of chemical potentials . to this end , we need to specify the values of the excess chemical potentials on neighboring nodes , and those may involve the values of the fluid densities in contact with the solid wall .",
    "we consider that the relevant value of the density is that in contact with the wall , which is somewhere in between the fluid and the solid node .",
    "such value can be obtained by requiring that it is consistent with the no - flux condition for the link flux of that species .",
    "the no flux condition is satisfied requiring ( see eq .",
    "( [ linkflux ] ) ) , @xmath105},\\ ] ] which should be understood as the extrapolation of the fluid density to ensure the absence of flux diffusion , and in general it is an implicit equation to obtain an estimate of the extrapolated number of particles , @xmath106 .",
    "note that this fictitious extrapolated density is a property of the link , not of the node .",
    "as we have mentioned in section [ section : model ] , the formulation based on the fluxes is based on the evolution of the number of particles contained in a given volume element . for the fluid nodes in the absence of solid interfaces",
    "the particle number is proportional to the number density .",
    "this is no longer the case close to a solid wall .",
    "this difference is pertinent because the excess chemical potential and the pressure are functions of the number density , @xmath103 .",
    "while for a wall at rest , one can still consider that the wall is equidistant from the nodes and @xmath64 and @xmath103 coincide , for a moving solid surface , the position of the solid boundary will change as it moves . in this case , a coefficient @xmath107 that establishes how close the solid boundary is to the fluid node should be introduced . in the limiting case that the solid boundary is reaching the neighboring fluid node",
    ", the corresponding cell has a volume that is approximately half the volume of a usual cell , hence @xmath108 ; in the opposite case when the solid surface reaches the solid node one gets accordingly @xmath109 .",
    "this coefficient then allows us to relate @xmath110 .",
    "although there exist different ways in which this coefficient may be computed , any smooth function that accounts for the volume change will be enough to avoid abrupt changes in the density when a fluid nodes is absorbed or created by the moving boundary .",
    "in the previous sections we have developed a model to simulate general non - ideal fluid mixtures .",
    "we will now analyze the special case in which the fluid mixture is an electrolyte .",
    "the simplest electrolyte model corresponds to a three - species mixture , two of them being the ionic species , @xmath111 and @xmath112 with charges @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and the third one being the neutral solvent @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath115 is the elementary charge , and @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the valencies of the ions . the local charge can then be expressed as @xmath118 $ ] .",

    ", @xmath92 stands for the charge density of the solid surfaces , if there are confining walls or moving suspended particles in the electrolyte .",
    "obviously , @xmath128 will be non - zero only on those solid surfaces .",
    "the equations ( [ eq : freeenergypb ] ) , ( [ electrokin ] ) , and ( [ poisson ] ) are commonly referred to as the electrokinetic equations .",
    "the electrostatic potential @xmath129 can be computed using standard techniques .",
    "specifically , we have implemented a successive over - relaxation scheme ( sor)@xcite as described in more detail in ref .",
    "the advantage of this model is that it does not presume a specific type of boundary condition , and can be easily generalized to deal with media of different dielectric constants .",
    "although not as fast as other methods for solving the poisson equation , it is adequate for our purposes because , once the local equilibrium charge profiles are achieved , the calculation of the disturbed electrostatic potential due to external forces is much less time consuming than the iteration part related to lattice - boltzmann and convection - diffusion .",

    "having verified that the model correctly reproduces the equilibrium behavior , we next turn to the calculation of flow caused by an external electric field .",
    "we apply a constant external electric field that is parallel to the slit , @xmath179 .",
    "this field causes hydrodynamic flow as it exerts a force on those fluid elements that carry a net charge .",
    "if we take @xmath180 as the component along the walls and refer to @xmath181 as the coordinate perpendicular to the walls , then , at the poisson - boltzmann level , the exact solution for the fluid flow in the steady state can be written as @xcite : @xmath182 , \\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the shear viscosity of the fluid . in our simulations",

    "( [ v flow ] ) , with @xmath185 ) that is exact in the debye - hckel limit .",

    "this suggests that the effect of electrostatic forces on the hydrodynamic flow is correctly taken into account in the simulations .      in the previous sections we have seen that the appropriate equilibrium charge distribution is reproduced both in the linear and non - linear regimes of the poisson - boltzmann equation , and that also a charge distribution induces the correct fluid profiles .",
    "we must still show that the opposite coupling works correctly , i.e. we must compute the hydrodynamic drag on a charged object in the absence of external electrical fields .    to this end , we compute the sedimentation velocity of an array of charged spheres immersed in an electrolyte solution . in this case , the velocity of the colloidal particle induces a fluid flow that determines the steady charge distribution around the sphere . this charge distribution in turn affects the sedimentation velocity of the particle .",
    "hence , all the different couplings between charge , electrostatic potential and fluid flow are present . such a scenario has been analyzed previously with a different model @xcite and analytically at infinite dilution @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", we can again check our simulations against known results .",
    "the system that we consider consists of a charged sphere of radius @xmath186 in a three - dimensional box of size @xmath187 .",
    "because of periodic boundary conditions , this corresponds to a periodic array of spheres with volume fraction @xmath188 . in the simulation , we first allow the electrolyte to equilibrate with the particle at rest in the absence of external forces ; hence the system develops its equilibrium double layer .",
    "then , we apply the gravity as an external body force applied to the fluid , i.e. we move in the system of reference of the colloid .",
    "in this way we avoid the problem of updating the particle s position due to its motion @xcite . by forcing the colloid to be at rest ,",
    "we will not conserve momentum , but by computing the mean fluid velocity in the steady state ( which is reached on a timescale of order @xmath189 ) , we can obtain the sedimentation velocity .    we have fixed the bjerrum length to @xmath190 and the radius of the sphere to @xmath191 in lattice units .",

    "since @xmath93 , we have performed most calculations using the second version of our simulation scheme , as described at the end of section  [ lb paragraph ] . however , we also performed some simulations using the original model ( taking the solvent density as the overall density ) .",
    "the only difference that we observe between the two implementations is a small variation in the numerical value of the sedimentation velocity .",
    "however , this difference already shows up for sedimentation of a neutral sphere .",
    "it is due to a small change in the fluid viscosity that is caused by a small difference in the overall fluid density in the two implementations .",
    "the valency of the macro - ion was chosen to be z=10 which corresponds to the small charge limit .",
    "although our computational scheme should also work outside the debye - hckel limit , we restrict ourselves to this regime , because it is only in this limit that we can compare with existing analytical results .",
    "specifically , booth predicted that the sedimentation velocity , @xmath198 , of a weakly charged sphere of valency @xmath199 in the dilute limit can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the sedimentation velocity of a neutral sphere , and @xmath202 is a constant that can be computed analytically in the debye hckel limit .",
    "for the simplified situation of monovalent co- and counter - ions , @xmath203 , which have the same diffusivity , @xmath204 , the expression for @xmath202 simplifies to @xmath205 where @xmath206 is a linear combination of exponential integral functions  @xcite and is a function of the inverse debye length , @xmath207 .",
    "we have checked that the sedimentation velocity scales as predicted with the viscosity .",
    "we have also verified that we are indeed in the linear regime where the sedimentation velocity is proportional to the applied gravitational field . in particular , for the two values of the density considered , @xmath92 , the linear regime was obtained for forces per unit of volume such that the flow velocity never exceeded @xmath208 in lattice units .",
    "[ fig4:diffusion dependence ] shows the sedimentation velocity of a weakly charged sphere ( @xmath209 ) as a function of the inverse debye screening length .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the sedimentation velocities scales with the ionic diffusivity in the way predicted by eq .",
    "[ booth simple ] .",
    "the inset in the same figure shows that this scaling breaks down at higher colloidal charges ( @xmath210 ) , i.e. outside the range of validity of the linearized poisson - boltzmann description .",
    "[ fig5:booth test ] shows the reduced sedimentation velocity ( @xmath211 ) as a function of @xmath212 for a range of volume fractions .",
    "as the volume fraction decreases , the curves approach booth s infinite - dilution result , while the minimum sedimentation velocity moves toward the minimum value predicted by theory . in order to compare quantitatively the simulation results with booth s",

    "( [ eq : booth ] ) , we must extrapolate the computed values for @xmath213 from the finite @xmath214-values of the simulations to the infinite - dilution limit , @xmath215 .",
    "for neutral spheres hashimoto has shown that that the sedimentation velocity converges very slowly to its infinite - dilution value , namely as  @xcite @xmath216 ladd has numerically verified this dependence  @xcite . for charged spheres , due to the electrostatic screening",
    ", we still expect that the dominant @xmath214 dependence comes from excluded volume ; previous results indicate that this is indeed the case @xcite .",
    "when performing the dilute limit expansion , we therefore decided to single out the major volume fraction dependence by normalizing the simulation results with the stokes drag coefficient , i.e. computing the low density limit of @xmath217 . as a result , it is reasonable to obtain the same functional dependence on @xmath214 as hashimoto with a slightly different amplitude . specifically , we expect @xmath218 where @xmath127 is much less than one .",
    "eventually , the dilute limit is obtained by extrapolating eq .",

    "the estimated error in the limiting sedimentation velocity is rather large .",
    "it could have been reduced by computing more values of the sedimentation velocity at low volume fractions .",
    "in addition , there is some uncertainty in the value of the effective sphere radius . in the light of these uncertainties , the agreement with the booth limit in fig .",
    "[ fig5:booth test ] is gratifying .",
    "we pointed out in section  [ section : model ] that one of the incentives for developing the present model was to eliminate any mixing of continuous - space gradients and discretized gradient operators .",
    "the reason is that the inevitable approximations associated with the discretization of gradient operators usually lead to the appearance of spurious mass and momentum fluxes , even in equilibrium .",
    "such spurious fluxes are present in particular whenever there exist spatial inhomogeneities related for example to the presence of liquid interfaces . in the present approach ,",
    "we only use lattice - gradient operators that have been constructed such that , in equilibrium , no flow can result . to demonstrate the effect that this has , we compare the present method with an existing `` mixed '' method .",
    "in particular , we consider a spherical colloid of radius @xmath220 , at rest in an electrolyte in a cubic box of diameter @xmath221 .",

    "[ fig6:spurious currents].a shows that spurious currents , although small , are certainly not negligible in this case .",
    "moreover , their magnitude is clearly correlated with the distance to the colloidal particle : the largest currents appear in the region where the spatial gradients are largest . for highly charged spheres ( i.e. outside the linear debye - hckel regime ) these spurious fluxes will become larger . in contrast , in fig .",
    "[ fig6:spurious currents].b ( present model ) , the spurious fluxes are at the level of machine precision .",
    "in fact , to make them visible at all , we had to multiply the momentum fluxes by a factor @xmath222 relative to the old model .",
    "in other words : the residual fluxes are controlled by machine accuracy .",
    "even at this level one can not detect a correlation between the fluxes and the position of the sphere .",
    "we can conclude that the proposed model eliminates the appearance of spurious equilibrium fluxes .",
    "we have introduced a new model to simulate the collective dynamics of non - ideal fluid mixtures , with special emphasis on its use to study electrokinetic phenomena .",
    "the method relies on a lattice - boltzmann model , where the interactions are introduced as effective forces . in this respect ,",
    "our model resembles a vlasov kinetic model , as opposed to previous kinetic lattice models . in our approach",
    "the fluxes between neighboring lattice nodes are the fundamental dynamical objects that couple external fields to both electrical conduction and hydrodynamic flow .    as a result of the symmetric formulation of the flux between neighboring nodes we can impose strict local mass conservation . as a consequence ,",
    "the present model is free of spurious boundary fluxes that plague all other lattice - boltzmann models of fluid mixtures .",
    "moreover , a link - based description has the additional advantage that boundary conditions are easily implemented .    secondly , by using a multi - step approach",
    ", we can vary ionic mobilities over many orders of magnitude .",
    "this feature of our model allows us to explore electroviscous effects over a wide range of peclet numbers .",
    "we have shown that flow causes spurious advection - diffusion . however ,",
    "this effect is well understood and can be made negligible in most practical cases .",
    "we have checked the performance of the model by studying equilibrium diffuse layers , showing that it is possible to recover both low and high charge density regimes . in the latter , the only limitation is related to computational resources , because a finer grid is required to resolve the narrower charge profiles that develop nearly highly charged walls . to test the coupling of electrostatics and fluid flow ,",
    "we have computed the sedimentation velocity of a charged sphere .",
    "these simulations indicate that the existing theoretical predictions are reproduced in the low - charge , low - density limit . as the charge of the colloid",
    "is increased , the simulation results start to deviate from the theoretical predictions that apply in the linearized poisson - boltzmann regime .",

    "<S> the method is based on identifying the elementary fluxes between nodes , which ensures the absence of spurious fluxes in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the model is suitable to study electro - osmotic flows . as an illustration </S>",
    "<S> , we show that , by introducing appropriate dynamic rules in the presence of solid interfaces , we can compute the sedimentation velocity ( and hence the sedimentation potential ) of a charged sphere . </S>",
    "<S> our approach does not assume linearization of the poisson - boltzmann equation and allows us for a wide variation of the peclet number . </S>"
