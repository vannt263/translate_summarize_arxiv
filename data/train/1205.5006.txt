    "between the photosphere and corona lies the chromosphere , a region of relatively cool plasma that is most conspicuous in the hydrogen h@xmath1 balmer line . the upper chromosphere is dominated by spicules , thin jets of chromospheric plasma that reach heights of @xmath2  km or more above the photosphere .",
    "although spicules were described already by secchi in 1877 , understanding their physical nature has progressed only slowly ( reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the launch of the hinode satellite @xcite and the combined use of adaptive optics and image post - processing @xcite in ground - based observing have revolutionized our view of spicules .",
    "there are ( at least ) two types @xcite .",
    "type  i spicules reach heights of 2 - 9  mm , show up- and downward velocities of 1030  kms@xmath0 , and have lifetimes of 310  minutes .",
    "they probably correspond to on - disk dynamic fibrils caused by shock waves that propagate upward into the chromosphere @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "type  ii spicules reach larger heights at velocities of order 50100  kms@xmath0 .",
    "they have shorter lifetimes , of order 100s , and usually only exhibit upward motion before their rapid fading in the chromospheric lines in which they are detected . on the disk",
    "they appear as rapidly moving absorption features in the blue wings of chromospheric lines @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on this intriguing class of features .",
    "our previous studies suggest that type  ii spicules represent impulsively accelerated chromospheric material that is continuously heated while it rises @xcite .",
    "the cause of the heating and acceleration are unknown , but a magnetic process such as reconnection and/or flux emergence is most likely .",
    "type  ii spicules show other motions in addition to radial outflow . in the ca  ii",
    "h line they are seen to sway to - and - from transversely with amplitudes of order 1020  kms@xmath0 and periodicities of 100500s , suggesting alfvnic waves @xcite .",
    "the continuation of these motions in transition region and coronal lines suggests that they may help drive the solar wind @xcite .",
    "other types of motion are less well established .",
    "@xcite reported that some spicules appear as double threads with evidence of spinning motion .",
    "and @xcite suggest that similar spinning explains the tilts of ultraviolet lines in so - called explosive events producing larger - scale macro spicules .",
    "spectral - line tilts were noted earlier in observations at the limb and also attributed to spicule rotation , or not interpreted @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we definitely confirm the indications for twisting spicular motions by unequivocally detecting torsional spicule modulation in limb spectroscopy and imaging spectroscopy with unprecedented spectral and spatial resolution .",
    "we analyze various data sets obtained with the swedish 1-m solar telescope ( sst , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on la palma : slit spectroscopy with the tri - port polarimetric echelle - littrow spectrograph and imaging spectroscopy with the crisp imaging spectropolarimeter ( crisp , * ? ? ?",
    "all observations used adaptive optics . with the trippel spectrograph we observed the caiih line at 396.8  nm with nominal spectral resolution of 1.6  pm .",
    "a slit - jaw camera of the same type was slaved to the spectrum camera .",
    "the data were binned to 0.49  pm spectral and 0.068  spatial pixel sizes .",
    "the spectrograms were corrected for dark current , gain variations , and spectrograph distortions following @xcite .",
    "we use a 55min duration , 0.91s cadence sequence of caiih spectrograms taken on 2009 october 8 in excellent seeing .",
    "the slit was set parallel to the limb at various heights above the limb ranging from 3  to 10 .",
    "the exposure time was 800  ms .",
    "crisp contains a dual fabry - prot interferometer and allows for fast ( @xmath350  ms ) wavelength tuning within a spectral region .",
    "high spatial resolution and precise alignment between the sequentially taken images for different tunings is achieved with the image restoration technique of @xcite and @xcite . in section  [ sec : results ] we present results from two crisp data sets : a 17min sequence at the ultra - high cadence of 0.44s sampling h@xmath1 ( 656.3  nm ) only at @xmath4  m  ( @xmath5  kms@xmath0 ) , registering the limb near ar11230 on 2011 june 11 , and an earlier 36min , 17s cadence sequence of finely spaced h@xmath1 and ca  ii 854.2  nm profile samplings registering the limb on 2010 june 27 .",
    "the best - fit solution has field - aligned velocities of 60  kms@xmath0 , torsional velocities of 30  kms@xmath0 and swaying motions of 15  kms@xmath0 with periods of 100 - 300s .",

    "the best - fit solution has field - aligned velocities of 60  kms@xmath0 , torsional velocities of 30  kms@xmath0 and swaying motions of 15  kms@xmath0 with periods of 100 - 300s .",
    "significant discrepancies occur for wave periods that are much higher or lower than these values . ]",
    "our various observations all show clear evidence of torsional motions on very small scales , of order 0.7  or less . we first demonstrate these in the trippel spectra .",
    "since the slit was oriented approximately parallel to the limb , it crossed many spicules . in figure",
    "[ fig : lx ] ( top row ) we show two @xmath6 cuts , selecting moments when the slit was located at least several arcseconds above the limb to avoid the enormous line - of - sight superposition at and just above the limb .",
    "the slit - jaw images indeed show many distinct spicules that seem at least partially resolved .",
    "each spectral @xmath6 panel contains multiple cases in which a spicule appears as a thin bright streak across the spectrum , with a small tilt from the horizontal wavelength direction and a substantial offset from nominal line center .",
    "we detected such behavior throughout the 55-min sequence at all sampled heights .",
    "the tilted - streak morphology indicates relative redshift on one side of a spicule , blueshift on the other .",
    "this reversal in transverse motion is the signature of torsional spicule motion .",
    "in addition , the substantial offsets of the tilted streaks from nominal line center can be understood as the superposition of swaying motion and a projection of field - aligned flow onto the line - of - sight .",
    "next , we examine how our data can be used to separate and constrain the magnitudes and other properties of these three types of spicular motion .",
    "figure  [ fig : lx ] ( bottom row ) shows the temporal variation of the caiih profile . although significant line - of - sight superposition occurs",
    ", we find clear evidence of quasi - sinusoidal episodes in the dopplershifts .",
    "to get an idea of the typical amplitudes and periods of such oscillations we overplot simple functions @xmath7 and find that amplitudes of order 20 - 40 kms@xmath0 and periods of order 100 - 200s are common .",
    "swaying and torsional motions can both produce such sinusoidal signature in @xmath8 plots , but they have a different appearance in a time sequence of successive @xmath6 plots , with swaying motions showing wiggling of the entire streak - like feature whereas torsional modulation shows up as a tilted streak that shrinks into a more vertical feature and then becomes tilted with opposite sign .",
    "detailed inspection of many such plots showed that temporal undulation as in figure  [ fig : lx ] ( bottom row ) is sometimes associated with swaying and sometimes with torsional modulation .",
    "our data inspection thus reveals evidence for three distinct types of spicular motion .",
    "given the limitations of our data sets ( in particular the enormous line - of - sight superposition at the limb and variations in seeing quality ) , we find that the best method to derive statistical properties of these different motions is to compare the observations with monte carlo simulations .",
    "we adapt methodology used previously by @xcite and @xcite : we consider @xmath9 spicules and impose on each a field - aligned flow @xmath10 , a torsional motion @xmath11 , and a swaying motion @xmath12 .",
    "inspired by our earlier analyses of type  ii spicules we assume that , during their lifetime @xmath13 , they continuously grow with constant velocity @xmath10 along a straight path , inclined by an angle @xmath1 from the vertical and with an azimuth angle @xmath14 , until they fade rapidly from view . the torsional and swaying motions are assumed to have periods @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , with random phase .",
    "figures  [ fig : mc1 ] and [ fig : mc2 ] shows examples of comparisons between observed @xmath6 and @xmath8 plots and results from these monte carlo simulations for different parameter choices .",
    "we made many such plots with large parameter variation and defined a best - fit solution by selecting parameter combinations that reproduce the observed behavior the best .",
    "per spicule this best - fit choice takes @xmath10 randomly from a gaussian distribution around 60 kms@xmath0 with standard deviation @xmath17",
    "kms@xmath0 ( similar to what is found by pereira et al . , in prep .",
    ") , @xmath13 from a gaussian distribution around 120s with @xmath18s ( pereira et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , @xmath1 from a gaussian distribution around 20 degrees with @xmath19 degrees ( based on slit - jaw images ) , @xmath14 from a uniform distribution over 0 - 360  degrees , @xmath11 from a gaussian distribution around 30  kms@xmath0 with @xmath19  kms@xmath0 , @xmath12 from a gaussian distribution around 15  kms@xmath0 with @xmath20  kms@xmath0 , and both @xmath16 and @xmath15 from a uniform distribution over 100 - 300s .",
    "comparison of the @xmath6 and @xmath8 panels for this best - fit solution with the observations in the top left panels of figures  [ fig : mc1 ] and [ fig : mc2 ] and in figure  [ fig : lx ] shows that the best - fit solution reproduces , statistically , the appearance of both types of data , with a similar multitude of slightly tilted streak - like features in @xmath6 and similar sinusoidal swings in @xmath8 .    how well defined are the best - fit parameters , given the large number of free parameters in our simulations ? to answer this question we ran multiple simulations in which we changed the distribution for only one parameter , keeping all others fixed .",
    "examples are given in the lower rows of figures  [ fig : mc1 ] and [ fig : mc2 ] .",
    "in the first panel of the second row ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mc1 ] ) the mean swaying amplitude is doubled and gives an overall zig - zag pattern with too many extremes .",
    "similarly , doubling the mean torsional amplitude gives streaks that are too wide in velocity .",
    "removing the swaying ( bottom - left panel ) produces too little zig - zag motion in @xmath6 .",
    "no torsional motion gives streaks that are too narrow in velocity .",
    "similarly , in the @xmath8 panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : mc2 ] , doubling the frequencies to periods of 50 - 100s of the swaying or torsional motion leads to too many wiggles , whereas lower frequencies ( periods 300 - 600s ) yield too few wiggles .",
    "note that it is more difficult to determine the periods since these often exceed the spicule lifetimes ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in summary , our monte - carlo analysis provides reasonably well - defined constraints . in order to reproduce the appearance of our limb",
    "spectra the torsional and swaying motions should be of order 30 and 15 kms@xmath0 , respectively , with periodicities of order @xmath21s .",
    "the next issue is whether the transverse swaying and torsional modulations represent propagating waves .",
    "since our limb spectra sample only one height above the limb at a time , we address this question with crisp imaging spectroscopy in h@xmath1 .",
    "the ultra - high cadence sequence permits the construction of doppler images by subtracting the images taken in the red and blue wings ( corresponding to @xmath22 kms@xmath0 dopplershift ) . in these",
    "we often observe very fast propagation of the doppler signal .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig : dop ] where the apparent phase speed is 285  kms@xmath0 .",
    "values in the range 100 - 300 kms@xmath0 are common .",
    "this is the order of magnitude expected for the alfvn speed in structures with densities of order @xmath23  @xmath24 @xcite and magnetic field strengths of order 10 - 30  gauss @xcite .",
    "determining whether these dopplershift modulations represent swaying or torsional motion is not straightforward . in our dopplergrams , torsional modulation will show up as a black - and - white pattern across a spicule only when the sum of the swaying motion and projection of the field - aligned flow happens to be zero .",
    "the large offsets from line center in figure  [ fig : lx ] suggest that such cancellation does not occur often",
    ". direct separation of the torsional and swaying modes is impeded by the combination of very high phase speed , sparse wavelength sampling , and relatively low cadence , i.e. , lack of simultaneity between the red- and blue - wing samplings .",
    "nevertheless , the black - and - white pattern of the spicule at @xmath25s in figure  [ fig : dop ] seems direct evidence of significant torsional motion .",
    "its propagation at about 300  kms@xmath0 provides further support that the observed rotational motions are a signature of torsional alfvn waves that propagate outward along spicules .",
    "our observations and analysis lead to the conclusion that spicules undergo three different types of motions at the same time : field - aligned flow aligned with the spicule axis , swaying that moves the spicule as a whole transverse to its axis , and torsional motion around its axis .",
    "the superposition of these motions complicates the interpretation of spicule spectroscopy and imaging considerably .",
    "our monte carlo simulations served to disentangle them and indicate that our observations are compatible with field - aligned flows of order 50 - 100  kms@xmath0 , swaying of order 15 - 20  kms@xmath0 , and torsional motion of order 25 - 30  kms@xmath0 .",
    "we also found evidence that the swaying and torsional motions are both signatures of alfvnic waves with periods of order 100 - 300s with propagation along the spicule axis at phase speeds as high as 100 - 300  kms@xmath0 .",
    "our data are inadequate to decide whether only upward propagation occurs , or whether propagation in both directions or even standing waves are as important for the torsional motions as they seem to be for swaying motions @xcite .",
    "our results impact several long - standing issues .",
    "first , any interpretation of observed spicular motion is likely wrong if not all three kinetic modes are properly accounted for .",
    "the classic reports of field - aligned outflows of order 20 - 30 kms@xmath0 from doppler shifts at the limb did not include torsional and swaying contributions .",
    "this introduces additional uncertainty in the historically reported values for field - aligned spicular flows , which are already plagued by poor spatio - temporal resolution .",
    "second , juxtaposition of the three modes of motion explains the appearance of spicular features in the blue and red wings of caii854.2  nm and h@xmath1 close to the limb .",
    "such images show rows ( `` bushes '' ) of near - vertical absorption features that are comparable to the on - disk `` rapid blue excursions '' ( rbes ) of @xcite . when these are compared between near - simultaneous red and blue outer - wing samplings , the red - shifted and blue - shifted features",
    "appear with remarkably similar , though not identical , morphology and orientation .",
    "precise fine - scale overlap is rare but the bush patterns often appear roughly the same . an h@xmath1 example pair is shown in the lower panels of figure  [ fig : crisp_lambdax ] .",
    "such outer - wing similarity has been interpreted as presence of similar field - aligned flows pointing towards and away from the observer , but the asymmetry of near - limb line - of - sight projection should then cause large morphological inequality .",
    "it is much more likely that large - amplitude transverse motions dominate the visibility close to the limb of outer - wing features and that they cause morphological equality through near - cospatial and alternating red and blue dopplershift modulation .",
    "the upper panels of figure  [ fig : crisp_lambdax ] indeed show spicular doppler tilts in the central spectrum panels , much like the off - limb ones in figure  [ fig : lx ] .",
    "this suggests that on - disk rbes also undergo torsional motion .",
    "our observations confirm the speculation of that torsional motions likely occur on smaller scales than their sumer observations of macrospicules and explosive events .",
    "our results also support the early work by @xcite and suggestions by @xcite that upward propagating alfvn waves explain indications of high - speed propagation of doppler signals along spicules .",
    "the presence and/or observed periods of propagating torsional alfvn waves can in principle provide information about the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of the guiding structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such idealized models are not yet a good representation of actual , highly dynamic spicules but may illustrate the potential diagnostic value of spicular wave observations .",
    "the ubiquity of torsional spicule motion also provides support for scenarios of spicule formation in which non - linear coupling of torsional alfvn waves to other wave modes on expanding flux tubes leads to significant field - aligned flows that drive the plasma upwards .",
    "however , none of these models can explain both the large observed field - aligned flows and the rapid heating to at least transition - region temperatures .",
    "this suggests that while torsional motions may play a role in providing upward momentum in spicules , other components of spicule formation are still missing .    while our monte carlo simulation assumes the presence of only the @xmath26 torsional mode ,",
    "the observations show also evidence for more complex torsional modes with @xmath27 ( see example at y=34  in top left panel of figure  [ fig : lx ] ) .",
    "our results thus may provide support for the recent hypothesis @xcite that complex torsional motions are generated in the interaction between convective motions and photospheric flux tubes , and that they may be responsible for heating of the chromosphere and corona .",
    "the observed torsional motions imply that spicules , given their ubiquity , play a major role in the transport of helicity through the solar atmosphere . in addition",
    ", our results suggest that the energy flux carried by alfvnic motions into the corona and heliosphere may be twice as large as the previous estimates that were based on swaying motions only .",
