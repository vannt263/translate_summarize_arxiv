    "a forefront area of research , both experimental and theoretical , concerns the exploration of the properties of matter under extreme conditions of temperature and/or density and the determination of the equation of state ( pressure versus density ) associated with it .",
    "its knowledge is of key importance for our understanding of the physics of the early universe , its evolution to the present day , compact stars , various astrophysical phenomena , and laboratory physics ( for an overview , see , for example , @xcite ) . on the earth ,",
    "relativistic heavy - ion colliders provide the only tool by means of which such matter can be created and its properties studied . on the other hand , however , it is well known that nature has created a large number of massive stellar objects , i.e. , white dwarfs and neutron stars , which contain matter in one of the densest forms found in the universe .",
    "neutron stars are associated with two classes of astrophysical objects  pulsars and compact x - ray sources .",
    "matter in their cores possess densities ranging from a few times the density of normal nuclear matter to about an order of magnitude higher , depending on star mass . to the present day",
    ", about 600 pulsars are known , and the discovery rate of new ones is rather high .",
    "this is accompanied by an impressive growth rate of the body of observed pulsar data , like pulsar temperatures determined by the x - ray observatories einstein , exosat , and rosat @xcite .    in this paper , we shall apply a broad collection of modern , field - theoretical equations of state ( eos ) to the study of the cooling behavior of both neutron stars and their strange counterparts  strange matter stars  which should exist if 3-flavor strange quark matter is more stable than confined hadronic matter .",
    "this collection of eoss was derived under numerous model assumptions about the behavior of superdense stellar matter .",
    "to mention several are : the many - body technique used to determine the equation of state ; the model for the nucleon - nucleon interaction ; description of electrically charge neutral neutron star matter in terms of either only neutrons , neutrons and protons in generalized chemical equilibrium ( @xmath0 equilibrium ) with electrons and muons , or nucleons , hyperons and more massive baryon states in @xmath0 equilibrium with leptons ; behavior of the hyperon coupling strengths in matter , inclusion of meson ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) condensation ; treatment of the transition of confined hadronic matter into quark matter ; and assumptions about the true ground state of strongly interacting matter ( i.e. , absolute stability of strange quark matter relative to baryon matter ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : structure ]",
    "we introduce the set of equations that govern the cooling behavior of massive stars .",

    "is given by ( schwarzschild metric ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the radially dependent metric functions .",
    "equations ( [ eq : gmunu ] ) and ( [ eq : ds ] ) combined with the law of energy - momentum conservation , @xmath9 , lead to @xmath10 which describe the structure of static stars that are in general - relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium ( tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations , cf .",
    "the metric function @xmath11 is determined by @xmath12    the baryon number @xmath13 is introduced as an integration variable , since this is the only conserved quantity in relativistic field theory .",
    "@xmath14 is the total mass within a sphere that contains @xmath13 baryons .",
    "its surface area is equal to @xmath15 .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 denotes pressure as a function of baryon number , @xmath17 is the total energy density , and @xmath18 the baryon number density . finally , we mention that the functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are related to each other by the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "the corresponding boundary conditions are given by @xmath21 the quantity @xmath22 is defined by the relation @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes a given star mass .",
    "the photosphere of the star is treated separately from the structure equations ( [ eq : tov.r])([eq : tov.p ] ) for two reasons : firstly , the equation of state of the photosphere depends much more sensitively on temperature than the core s equation of state , which can be treated at zero temperature ; secondly , because of a scaling behavior ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) the structure equations of the photosphere need to be solved only once , for a properly chosen star mass .",
    "the interface between crust and photosphere is located at the density @xmath25 .",
    "we shall use the value given by van riper @xcite , @xmath26  g@xmath27 .",
    "since the central star temperature drops down to less than @xmath28 within a few minutes after birth @xcite , the effects of finite temperatures on the equation of state can be neglected to a very good approximation .",
    "consequently , the four differential equations ( [ eq : tov.r])([eq : tov.p ] ) do not depend on time and thus need to be solved only once , at the beginning of the numerical cooling simulation .",
    "the thermal evolution is described by the partial differential equations of energy balance @xcite , @xmath29 and thermal energy transport , @xmath30 the microphysical input into equations ( [ eq : ebal ] ) and ( [ eq : etran ] ) are the neutrino emissivity per unit volume , @xmath31 , heat capacity per unit volume , @xmath32 , and thermal conductivity , @xmath33 .",
    "the boundary conditions for ( [ eq : ebal ] ) and ( [ eq : etran ] ) read @xmath34 where @xmath35 is fixed by the properties of the photosphere at @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the initial condition for the star s temperature can be assumed , without loss of generality , to be @xmath37  k , because the star s thermal evolution at times greater than say a few months does not depend on the exact initial temperature profile inside the star .",
    "equations ( [ eq : ebal ] ) and ( [ eq : etran ] ) were solved numerically by means of a newton - raphson - like algorithm .",
    "table [ tab : inputs ] summarizes the    .input quantities for the cooling simulations performed in this paper [ tab : inputs ] [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     associated neutrino emissivities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : emis ] .",
    "[ fig : emis ]      the most important neutrino process in the crust is neutrino - antineutrino pair production by electron bremsstrahlung . in early estimates",
    "it was found that the contribution of this process to cooling is competitive with standard cooling via the modified urca process .",
    "however , recent investigations have shown that the mass of the ionic crust is reduced by a factor of two to three if one considers the recently established value @xmath38 for the transition density between crust and core @xcite , instead of the older value @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "additionally , considerations by pethick and thorsson @xcite have pointed out that the standard perturbative treatment of determining @xmath40 is not sufficiently accurate below a temperature of @xmath41  k. furthermore taking the electronic band structure into account can reduce the energy emission rates exponentially for temperatures below @xmath41  k. we include these corrections to the emissivities derived by itoh et al . in @xcite . additionally to the above process , pair , photon and plasmon processes",
    "may also be important in the low density regime .",
    "their effects have been estimated too by itoh et al . in @xcite , and will be used in our calculations .",
    "neutrino - antineutrino pair bremsstrahlung production can also occur in the core according to @xmath42 we note that the emissivity of the last bremsstrahlung process , equation ( [ eq : br3 ] ) , becomes very important if the neutrons become superfluid . in this case",
    "this process dominates all other processes . for the processes ( [ eq : br1 ] ) to ( [ eq : br3 ] ) we use the emissivities as calculated by friman and maxwell @xcite .",
    "the beta decay and electron capture processes , @xmath43 also known as the direct urca processes , were not included in cooling calculations @xcite until recently , since energy and momentum conservation can only be fulfilled if the proton fraction exceeds a critical value ( cf .",
    "section [ subsec : dirurca ] ) .",
    "most interestingly , many of the older , non - relativistic models for the equations of state of neutron star matter indeed do not lead to sufficiently high enough proton fractions . consequently ,",
    "the so - called modified urca process , which is characterized by the occurrence of a bystander particle which is necessary to conserve both energy and momentum of the baryons that are being scattered , i.e. , @xmath44 were considered to be the dominant cooling mechanism of neutron stars .",
    "the emission rates associated with processes ( [ eq : modurc ] ) were calculated by friman and maxwell @xcite . there",
    "the exchanged @xmath1 meson is treated as a free particle .",
    "such an approximation neglects the influence of the medium on the propagating pion .",
    "furthermore , the exchanged pions undergo weak transitions ( so - called exchange current effect ) .",
    "an estimate of the influence of such effects , performed by voskresenski and senatorov @xcite , shows that the neutrino emissivities may increase by up to several orders of magnitude . the implications of these effects of cooling will be studied in a different investigation @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , the direct urca process ( [ eq : dirurca ] ) is only possible if the proton fraction exceeds a certain critical value @xcite . if the star is assumed to be made up of only neutrons , protons and electrons , the critical proton fraction amounts about @xmath45 . in one",
    "includes hyperons and muons too , the critical value increases slightly to @xmath46 .",
    "in contrast to older , non - relativistic equations of state which predict proton fractions that lie below the critical values , modern non - relativistic as well as relativistic equations of state contain sufficiently large enough proton fractions such that the direct urca process becomes possible .",
    "the proton fraction depends crucially on the asymmetry energy which unfortunately is not known at higher densities . from our study",
    "we find that the proton fraction is generally larger for the relativistic equations of state than for the non - relativistic ones .",
    "this trend can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : protonfraction ] , where the proton fractions    [ fig : protonfraction ]    are shown for several equations of state of our collection . the critical energy densities beyond which the direct urca becomes possible , are indicated . because of the different asymmetry behaviors of these equations of state , the critical densities vary considerably from one equation of state to another .",
    "this , in turn , links the onset of the direct urca process to the condition of a sufficiently large enough star mass . for the emissivities of the direct urca process we shall use those calculated by lattimer et al . @xcite .",
    "the emissivity of the direct process exceeds the one of the modified process by up to ten orders of magnitude , at low temperatures of @xmath47  k.    so far we have considered the direct urca process in neutron star matter made up of protons and neutrons only .",
    "strange baryons and @xmath48 isobars , however , which may exist in such matter rather abundantly too , also produce neutrinos via direct urca processes of the following type , @xmath49 such processes have been studied first by prakash et al .",
    "@xcite , and the implications for cooling of neutron stars were explored in @xcite .",
    "we have included the above processes in cooling simulations elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it was found that the cooling behavior due to direct urca among the nucleons only dominates over the energy loss associated with processes the ( [ eq : durca2 ] ) . or , in quantitative terms",
    ", the cooling curves obtained by restriction to the direct urca process among non - superfluid nucleons ( section [ ssec : edurca ] ) remain practically unchanged .      in the charged pion ( @xmath50- )",
    "condensed phase , the quasi - particle urca processes @xmath51 are possible . the quasi - particle state @xmath52 is given by the superposition of proton and neutron states , @xmath53 with the mixing angle @xmath54 .",
    "the emissivity for this process was calculated by maxwell et al .",
    "@xcite .    in recent years",
    ", some authors made a strong case for the condensation of kaons in the cores of neutron stars ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the critical density beyond which this process may take place is uncertain .",
    "estimates lie in the range of @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the emissivities of the quasi - particle direct urca processes , @xmath56 are reduced , relative to the uncondensed case , by a factor of @xmath57 @xcite . additionally to ( [ eq : kmes1 ] ) there are two more processes , @xmath58 whose emissivities were calculated by thorsson et al . @xcite .",
    "the density dependence of the mixing angle @xmath54 and the value of the critical density , @xmath59 are taken from @xcite .",
    "the possible existence of quark matter in the cores of neutron stars has already been outlined in sect .",
    "[ ssec : eos : comparison ] .",
    "the latest calculations on this topic predict an onset of the transition of confined hadronic matter into quark matter at @xmath60 .",
    "( this is not to be confused with the possibility of absolutely stable strange matter , to which we will return in sect .",
    "[ sec : strangestars ] ) .",
    "the following weak processes are important in quark matter consisting of up , down and strange quarks , @xmath61 we shall use the neutrino emission rates given by duncan , shapiro , and wasserman @xcite to simulate the cooling history of neutron stars containing a mixed phase of baryons and quarks in their interior ( hybrid stars ) and strange stars .",
    "we tested the correctness of our numerical code by means of comparing the outcome of several cooling calculations with those obtained by other authors .",
    "as an example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : vanrip ] we compare    [ fig : vanrip ]    our surface temperatures , obtained for a particular model for the equation of state , with the corresponding results obtained by van riper @xcite .",
    "the agreement is extremely good for all star ages . to achieve this agreement , however , we had to reduce the core s thermal conductivity , which was not specified by van riper , from the value given in @xcite by a factor of 40 .",
    "otherwise deviations of about @xmath62 were obtained at star ages between @xmath63 to 10  years .",

    "the photon yields of three pulsars ( psr s 1706 - 44 , 1823 - 13 , and 2334 + 61 ) contain too few photons in order to perform spectral fits .",
    "the luminosities are calculated by using the totally detected photon flux .",
    "these pulsars are marked with triangles in the figures .",
    "the spectra of seven pulsars , including the crab pulsar ( psr 0531 + 21 ) , can only be fitted by a power - law type spectrum or a blackbody spectrum with a very high effective temperature , and an effective area much smaller than the neutron star surface .",
    "their x - ray emission is predominated by magnetospheric emission .",
    "therefore , their temperatures , determined from the spectral fits , are probably too high .",
    "theses pulsars are marked with solid dots .",
    "3 .   finally , there are four pulsars ( i.e. , 0833 - 45 ( vela ) , 0656 + 14 ,",
    "0630 + 18 ( ge - minga ) , and 1055 - 52 ) that allow two - component spectral fits , where the softer blackbody components corresponds to the actual surface emission of the neutron star and the harder to some magnetospheric emission .",
    "these pulsars are marked with squares .    when discussing spectra of neutron stars one should keep in mind that neutron stars are not black bodies , because hydrogen and helium in their atmospheres modify the blackbody spectrum .",
    "besides , strong magnetic fields can also affect the surface emission .",
    "with respect to the luminosity determinations we note that the luminosities determined via hydrogen- or helium - atmospheric models are generally lower by a factor of about three than those determined via blackbody spectral fits .",
    "the inverse is true for the temperature which is smaller by a factor of about two .",
    "an uncertainty in temperature by a factor of two varies the luminosity , according to the stefan - boltzmann law ( @xmath80 ) , by a factor of 16 .",
    "it is thus not appropriate to perform a comparison with surface temperatures of stars @xcite .",
    "instead one should be using the luminosities , as is the case here .",
    "figure [ fig : standard ] shows the cooling history of a neutron star    [ fig : standard ]    with @xmath81 that cools down via the standard scenario only , i.e. , fast cooling processes are not allowed .",
    "the different curves correspond to different models for the equation of state .",
    "one sees that the standard cooling behavior depends only weakly on the equation of state .",
    "the uv@xmath82+uvii   model cools somewhat faster at later times than the other two models .",
    "this is due to the rather soft behavior of the uv@xmath82+uvii   equation of state at intermediate nuclear densities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] ) , which leads to neutron stars with small radii ( figs .",
    "[ fig : rho : r:0.5][fig : rho : r:1.8 ] ) .",
    "obviously , most of the observed data are not in agreement with the assumption of standard cooling .",
    "specifically vela s ( 0833 - 45 ) luminosity lies considerably below the computed curves .",
    "the data of psr 0630 + 18 ( geminga ) and a few others are in relatively good agreement , however . , which , due to lack of information , usually is taken to be constant during a pulsar s spin - down .",
    "moreover a canonical value of @xmath83 @xcite , which corresponds to a slow - down by emission of pure magnetic dipole radiation , is assumed .",
    "this too constitutes a rather crude approximation . ]      as mentioned above , one way by means of which neutron stars can cool very efficiently is the direct urca process @xcite .",
    "this is demonstrated graphically in figs .",

    "the proton fraction in the stars with @xmath85 is for all three cases below the threshold density for the direct urca process .",
    "hence these stars cool via the standard mechanism , the modified urca process .",
    "the cooling behavior of all other stars at early stages is dominated by the direct urca process .",
    "the sudden drop in luminosity at ages of several hundred years has its origin in the fact that the core cools down much faster through the enhanced cooling process than the crust .",
    "this causes a temperature inversion in young stars .",
    "after several hundred years , depending on the thickness of the crust , the `` _ _ cooling wave _ _ '' , built up by the temperature gradient , reaches the star s surface which leads to the sudden luminosity drops .",
    "( an estimate of the time needed by the cooling wave to reach the surface can be found in @xcite . )",
    "the drop of luminosity increases with massive , since the region inside the core of a star where the direct urca process is possible grows with density .",
    "the drop is most strongly pronounced for uv@xmath82+uvii .",
    "this has its origin in the @xmath86   neutron - superfluid which does not extent into the central core .",
    "changes in the hyperon couplings strengths in matter influence the cooling curves only very little , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : universal ] for neutron stars of several different    [ fig : universal ]    masses .",
    "( note that this may be drastically different if the direct urca process among hyperons occurs is dense stellar matter @xcite . )",
    "the star with @xmath87 does not contain hyperons , since its core is not dense enough to reach the threshold density for hyperon population .",
    "hence there is only one cooling curve in this case .",
    "the situation is different for the heavier stars shown in this figure , for which the hyperon concentration increases with star mass @xcite .",
    "the hyperons are coupled to the meson fields either with the same strengths as the nucleons , i.e. , @xmath88 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : ghyp ] ) ) , or are chosen such that mutual compatibility between the @xmath11 binding energy in saturated nuclear matter , neutron - star masses , and experimental data on hypernuclear levels is achieved ( cf .",
    "[ ssec : eos : comparison ] ) . as for the other figures of this section ,",
    "the direct urca process among the nucleons is included , and no superfluidity is taken into account .",
    "the impact of pion condensation on the cooling of neutron stars @xcite is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pion.g300 ] .",
    "[ fig : pion.g300 ]    comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : dr.g300 ] shows that the cooling behavior of such stars is qualitatively similar to the one of stars which cool via the direct urca process .",
    "the threshold density of the pion condensate lies at @xmath89 , just slightly above normal nuclear matter saturation density . hence all stars displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pion.g300 ] , with the exception of @xmath90 , possess a pion condensate and therefore show enhanced cooling triggered by the condensate .",
    "the cooling behavior of kaon - condensed stars ( see also @xcite ) is qualitatively similar to those of pion - condensed stars .",
    "this is graphically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kaon.g300 ] for the    [ fig : kaon.g300 ]    g@xmath84  equation of state .",
    "there is however a significant quantitative difference between both types of condensation which concerns the threshold densities .",
    "it amounts for kaon condensation about @xmath91 @xcite , which is by a factor of @xmath92 larger than the threshold density established for pion condensation , @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "a density of @xmath91 is reached only in the most massive star model , @xmath94 , constructed for g@xmath84 .",
    "hence the other two models cool via the modified urca process only . for the purpose of comparison , the central density of the @xmath95 neutron star amounts @xmath96 which lies almost by a factor of two below the kaon threshold",
    "the situation would be different for softer models for the equation of state , which lead to higher central neutron star densities .",
    "for the broad collection of modern equations of state of ref .",
    "@xcite we find central densities in @xmath97 stars that range from about @xmath98 to @xmath99 .",
    "the latter value comes much closer to the critical value for kaon condensation derived in @xcite , which , of course , is model dependent too and thus not accurately known .",
    "clearly , the smaller the threshold density the faster the cooling of compact stars via kaon condensation will be .",
    "as discussed before , modern investigations of the possible transition of baryon matter into quark matter predict transition densities less than twice normal nuclear matter density .",
    "such densities are easily reached in neutron stars with masses @xmath100 @xcite ( see also discussion at the end of section [ ssec : kaon ] ) . to simulate the cooling history of such ( hybrid ) stars",
    "we apply glendenning s g@xmath101  equation of state , whose specific properties have been discussed in connection with table [ tab : eos2 ] .",
    "the weak reaction processes of the quarks are those given in equations ( [ eq : quark1 ] ) and ( [ eq : quark2 ] ) .",
    "they speed up the energy loss of a star considerably , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : k240b180 ] , where the solid curves correspond to    [ fig : k240b180 ]    enhanced cooling caused by the quarks ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the dashed curves refer to stars with no quarks in their cores , which therefore cool more slowly .",
    "note that the density in the light stars with @xmath102 is not high enough to reach the transition into quark matter .",
    "enhanced quark cooling is therefore not possible for these stars .",
    "finally , if the quarks should form a superfluid , the emission of neutrinos is suppressed and cooling proceeds at a much slower pace ( dotted curves ) .",
    "bailin and love have stated that quarks might become superfluid @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there exists  as far as we know  no estimation of the gap energy of superfluid quark matter . therefore , in order to simulated this effect , we simply assumed a plausible value of @xmath103  mev for the @xmath104   pairing state of quarks , which was taken to be constant over the whole density range .",
    "we restrict ourself to determine the cooling behavior of strange stars which are either bare or possess the densest possible hadronic crust that can be carried by such objects ( inner crust density equal to neutron drip density ) .",
    "figure [ fig : sm.nosf ] reveals that , no    [ fig : sm.nosf ]    matter how thick the crust , such stars cool very rapidly @xcite . among the body of observed luminosities ,",
    "there is presently one data point that would be consistent with the assumption that the underlying object is a strange star .",
    "this interpretation is not stringent of course , because some of the enhanced cooling mechanisms studied above might do as well .",
    "if one treats the quarks as superfluid , neutrino production ceases and therefore cooling is considerably slowed down . to simulate this effect",
    "qualitatively we assumed a density - independent energy gap of @xmath103  mev .",
    "the numerical outcome of such a simulation is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm.sf ] .",
    "one sees that in    [ fig : sm.sf ]    this case the cooling behavior of strange stars is similar to the enhanced cooling behavior of neutron stars ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig : dr.uvu][fig : k240b180 ] ) . hence , with the exception of psr 0540 - 69 practically all observed pulsar luminosities can now be reproduced too . a quantitative clarification of the question as to whether or not quark matter indeed becomes superfluid , and if so , at which densities , attains particular interest from astrophysics too .",
    "there is also the possibility that the quark flavors become superfluid at different densities .",
    "consequently the heat capacity would be somewhat smaller . to simulate this possibility we reduce the heat capacity by an ( arbitrary ) factor of three .",
    "the consequences for the cooling behavior are shown by the dotted curves in [ fig : sm.sf ] .    in closing this section",
    ", we mention that one of the main differences between the cooling behavior of neutron stars and strange quark matter stars concerns the time needed for the cooling wave to reach the surface .",
    "this time is much shorter for strange quark matter stars because their crusts have a thickness of only @xmath105  km as opposed to @xmath106  km for stars with @xmath107 .",
    "we have already pointed out in section [ sec : observations ] that the observed cooling data of pulsars marked with squares in our figures appear to be the most significant ones .",
    "primarily these data should be reproduced by theoretical cooling calculations . as we have seen above ( section [ sec : standard ] )",
    "the luminosities of a few pulsars , like 1951 + 32 and 1055 - 52 , appear to be compatible with the standard cooling scenarios .",
    "depending on the model employed for the equation of state , this may also be the case for geminga and pulsars 0656 + 14 , 2334 + 61 ( cf .",

    "others , however , like the famous vela pulsar ( psr 0833 - 45 ) and psr s 1706 - 44 , 1929 + 10 , which have rather low observed luminosities , may require the introduction of so - called fast ( or enhanced ) cooling processes , which are characterized by higher neutrino emission rates by means of which stars cool more rapidly . a final decision on this issue  standard versus enhanced cooling @xcite  is presently hampered by the uncertainties in a number of quantities , including the modified urca neutrino - emission rate , superfluid gaps , equation of state , and mass and age of the star .",
    "nevertheless , subject to the enormous progress that is being made presently in exploring the behavior of superdense matter @xcite , one may feel confident that this will change in the foreseeable future .",
    "figure [ fig : enhanced.nosf ] compares the influence of different    [ fig : enhanced.nosf ]    enhanced neutrino emission processes , i.e. , direct urca , pion and kanon condensation , and quark urca , on the cooling behavior of a neutron star with mass @xmath95 .",
    "the nucleons and quarks are treated as non - superflid particles .",
    "one sees that the inclusion of any of these enhanced cooling processes reduces the star temperature too quickly in order to get agreement with the observed data points .",
    "the only exception is psr 1929 + 10 .",
    "the most significant data points ( squares ) , however , lie considerably above the enhanced cooling curves .",
    "the enhanced cooling scenarios can be slowed down if one assumes that the neutrons in the cores of neutron stars are superfluid , as was the case in figs .",
    "[ fig : dr.uvu][fig : k240b180 ] .",
    "the only problem left then concerns the horizontal `` plateaus '' in these figures at star ages between @xmath108 and @xmath109 years which tend to lie somewhat too high for stars with canonical mass , @xmath95 , to be consistent with the data .",
    "note , however , that one gets agreement with some of the data points if the star mass is assumed to be different from the canonical value .",
    "another possibility to get agreement consists in varying the gap energy , @xmath110 , which , as mentioned in section [ sec : superfl ] , is not very accurately know .",
    "this is particularly the case for the high - density @xmath86   superfluid .",
    "a reduction of this gap by a factor of two , for instance , moves the cooling curves up right into the region where the oberved data is concentrated , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : redsf ] .",
    "[ fig : redsf ]    of course there are other possibilities , besides reducing the gap energy , by means of which agreement with the observed data may be achieved .",
    "for example , the superfluid phase of neutrons might not reach the center of very massive neutron stars , as is the case for stars constructed for uv@xmath82+uvii   ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dr.uvu ] ) .",
    "this is due to the smaller proton fraction and the resulting higher fermi momenta of neutrons .",
    "another possibility is an additional cooling process not suppressed by superfluidity , as , for example , the superfluid pair - breaking process @xcite , or so - called internal heating of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "we have applied a broad collection of modern , field theoretical models for the equation of state of superdense matter to the investigation of the cooling behavior of compact stars , which comprise neutron stars and their strange counterparts , the hypothetical strange stars .",
    "the models for the equation of state were derived elsewhere , using many - body approximation techniques at different levels of sophistication and complexity .",
    "furthermore , uncertainties in the behavior of matter at extreme densities , like the phenomenon of meson condensation , superfluidity , hyperon degrees of freedom , transition to quark matter , and absolute stability of strange quark matter are incorporated in this collection .    besides _ standard _ cooling , which , subject to uncertainties in the neutrino emission - rate of the modified urca process , superfluid gaps etc .",
    "section [ sec : con ] ) , gives agreement between the theoretical cooling curves and the observed data for some but not all pulsars ( the obtained luminosities are considerably too high in some cases ) , we studied various _ enhanced _",
    "cooling mechanisms too .",
    "these are connected to higher neutrino - emission rates coming from the direct urca process , @xmath1 and @xmath2meson condensates , and up , down and strange quarks in the cores of neutron stars .",
    "it turns out that the enhanced processes altogether cool the star models too rapidly in order to get agreement with the data .",
    "so one is left with introducing processes which delay somewhat the cooling as driven by the enhanced processes .",
    "a plausible candidate is superfluidity , of which there occur probably two different types in the cores of neutron stars , namely @xmath104   and @xmath86 . due to the complicated theoretical analysis",
    ", the density dependences and widths of the associated superfluid gaps can not be determined exactly , especially in the latter case . by using the more reliable @xmath104   gaps we find that already small changes of the theoretical value for the @xmath86   gap shift the cooling curves into the region of observed data , giving an overall good agreement .",
    "an accurate determination of the superfluid gaps in neutron star matter seems therefore of particular interest .",
    "most interestingly , we find that  for a given star mass  not a single model for the equation of state of our collection is able to explain more than just a few data points !",
    "this makes one wonder if the observed data are possibly associated with stars of _ different _ masses .",
    "we recall that the canonical neutron star mass is about @xmath111 , and the observed data @xcite seem to concentrate about this value .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of pulsars with quite different masses , e.g. , neutron stars in binary systems that accrete mass from their companions , seems equally plausible .",
    "if one assumes that the observed luminosities are indeed coming from stars with different masses , those of vela and crab could amount @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively , then one may have a reason for the different cooling behaviors .",
    "as mentioned repeatedly , the absolute stability of strange quark matter would have implications of greatest importance for various branches of physics @xcite .",
    "it is agreed on that compact stars form ideal environments where such matter could be found . adopting a simple model for the eos of strange matter , we studied the cooling history of stars made up of such matter , too . if the emissivities and heat capacities of quark matter used here constitute reliable estimates , which , at present , is an unresolved issue , we find that pulsars like geminga , monogem , and psr 1055 - 52 could be ruled out as strange pulsar candidates .",
    "there is however one pulsar , psr 1929 + 10 , which could be interpreted as a strange star .",
    "of course , the qcd related uncertainties in the properties of strange matter do not allow to draw any stringent conclusions yet . in order to provide a feeling for how sensitive the cooling history of strange stars depends on the transport properties of strange matter",
    ", we also performed cooling simulations where the emissivity and heat capacity were slightly varied , due to a possible superfluid behavior of the quarks .",
    "as it turns out , this moves the cooling curves right into the region of the luminosity  age plane where most of the observed data are concentrated .",
    "so there is clearly a big need for reliably determined transport properties of strange quark matter . at the present level of development it seems to us that no definitive decision can be made as to whether the observed",
    "luminosities are being emitted from conventional neutron stars or their strange counterparts .    in summary",
    ", we find that really stringent conclusions about the behavior of superdense matter on the basis of the observed cooling data can not be made at present .",
    "however this situation would change if besides the luminosity and the age also the mass of just a single pulsar could be determined !",
    "the rapid discovery pace of newly observed pulsars in combination with the enormous progress that has been made in observational x - ray astronomy are very encouraging in this respect .",
    "2.truecm + we would like to thank k. a. van riper for sending us his tables of the mantle temperature as a function of luminosity , @xmath114 , which were used in our cooling calculations .",
