    "<S> we report an experiment in which one determines , with least tomographic effort , whether an unknown two - photon polarization state is entangled or separable . </S>",
    "<S> the method measures whole families of optimal entanglement witnesses . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce adaptive measurement schemes that greatly speed up the entanglement detection . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments are performed on states of different ranks , and we find good agreement with results from computer simulations .    * introduction *    entangled states play an important role in the manipulation of quantum information , be it for present - day quantum key distribution or future quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> one may need to verify if a certain quantum state  perhaps emitted by a source of quantum - information carriers or obtained as the output of a quantum computation  is entangled or not . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , the expectation value of an _ entanglement witness _ is telling : the state is surely entangled if a negative value is obtained . a positive value , however , is inconclusive  the unknown state could be entangled or separable , the witness can not tell , but other witnesses might be able to . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of a witness was first used by m. , p. , and r.  horodecki @xcite , and the term `` witness '' was introduced by terhal @xcite ; for reviews that cover all important aspects of entanglement witnesses , see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> how many witnesses , then , does one need to measure until a conclusion is reached ? </S>",
    "<S> the answer to this question is given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : if one solely relies on the expectation values of the witnesses one by one , one may never get a conclusive answer ; if , however , the expectation values of suitably chosen witnesses are jointly used for an estimation of the quantum state , @xmath0 witnesses suffice for a @xmath1-dimensional quantum system .    the number can be further reduced by exploiting all the information gathered when determining the expectation values of the witnesses measured in succession . in the case of a two - qubit state ( @xmath2 ) , for instance , one never has to measure more than six witnesses , rather than @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be demonstrated by an experiment such as the one proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; we are here reporting its laboratory realization .    </S>",
    "<S> * witnesses and witness families *    a hermitian observable @xmath4 is an entanglement witness if @xmath5 for _ all _ separable states @xmath6 and @xmath7 for at least one entangled state @xmath8 . for each entangled state </S>",
    "<S> , there are some witnesses that detect it ( `` @xmath9 '' ) , but many other witnesses will give an inconclusive result ( `` @xmath10 '' ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall concern ourselves with two - qubit systems  in the experiment , they are polarization qubits of a down - converted photon pair  and focus on optimal decomposable witnesses @xcite of the form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the ket of an entangled pure two - qubit state , and @xmath13 denotes the partial transposition on the second qubit . </S>",
    "<S> this witness is optimal in the sense that no other witness can detect some entangled states in addition to the states already detected by @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the generic example is @xmath14 with @xmath15 , on which all other @xmath12s can be mapped by local unitary transformations .    for any @xmath16 , </S>",
    "<S> the eigenkets of the resulting witness , @xmath17 are the same : the two product kets @xmath18 and @xmath19 as well as the two bell kets @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this whole family of entanglement witnesses can , therefore , be measured by the projective measurement of their common eigenstates  the _ witness basis _ of the family . for a separable state , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 for all @xmath16 , and this requirement implies the witness - family criterion @xcite @xmath22 here , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the probabilities for the two product states , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are those for the bell states ; we estimate these probabilities from the observed frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , once the frequency data are obtained from the measurement , a negative value of @xmath27 reveals that the unknown state @xmath28 is entangled .    </S>",
    "<S> three remarks are in order . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) the expectation value of one witness @xmath29 is a linear function of the @xmath30s , whereas @xmath27 is a quadratic function . </S>",
    "<S> this is reminiscent of , yet different from , the `` nonlinear entanglement witness '' of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which requires a joint measurement on two copies of the unknown state . </S>",
    "<S> our _ witness - family measurement _ uses only one copy at a time . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) also , the nonlinear witnesses of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite are quite different ; their evaluation requires complete or almost complete knowledge of the state . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) the witnesses @xmath29 can also be measured by other schemes , such as that of barbieri _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite who extracted the expectation value of @xmath31 from local measurements that examine the two qubits individually . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , we perform a joint measurement on both qubits , which implements the projective measurement in the eigenbasis of @xmath29 and so realizes the most direct measurement of the witness . </S>",
    "<S> see the appendix for more details about ( ii ) and ( iii ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our witness - family measurement provides estimates for _ three _ two - qubit observables ( four @xmath30s with unit sum ) , whereas the expectation value of a single witness is only one number . as discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , this can be exploited for quantum - state reconstruction after measuring six witness families , related to each other by the six local unitary transformations of table  [ tbl : six ] : each witness family provides the expectation values of one ( of six ) single - qubit observables and of two ( of nine ) two - qubit observables . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a measurement of all six witness families constitutes an informationally complete ( ic ) measurement for full tomography of an unknown two - qubit state ; thereby , all six single - qubit parameters and six two - qubit parameters are obtained once , while three two - qubit parameters are determined twice . </S>",
    "<S> this offers the possibility of measuring an ic set of witness families such that , if all families give an inconclusive result ( @xmath32 ) , a full state estimation can be performed for identifying @xmath28 . with @xmath28 then at hand , its separability can be determined straightforwardly by , for example , checking the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite .    .[tbl : six]the six witness families that enable full tomography of the two - qubit state . </S>",
    "<S> the single - qubit unitary operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 transform the first family into the other five families . </S>",
    "<S> the pauli operator @xmath35 permutes @xmath36 and @xmath37 ; the clifford operator @xmath38 permutes the three pauli operators cyclically . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the angles @xmath16 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , for which the various @xmath41s are realized , are reported in table  [ stbl : six ] . as an example , we consider @xmath42 and verify that @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are correct choices . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , they are : @xmath46 since the global phase factor is irrelevant .    * hom interferometer *    to implement the most direct measurement of the witness bases , we make use of a hom interferometer . for its optimization </S>",
    "<S> , we first remove the bss in the output ports of the pbss ; see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : exp ] . </S>",
    "<S> next , we address the outputs of the two detectors in the transmission ports of the two pbss to a coincidence unit , where we record the coincidence rate for the input two - photon state @xmath47 . a translation stage with a step size of @xmath48 is used to control the temporal overlap between the photons , and the spatial overlap is controlled by adjusting the mirrors that direct the two beams to interfere on the bs . </S>",
    "<S> the interferometer is optimized at where the coincidence rate is minimal , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sfig : homdip ] . </S>",
    "<S> the visibility of the hom dip is @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> imperfections in the bs ratios , the wps , and the polarization controllers limit the maximum experimental achievable visibility of the dip </S>",
    "<S> . nevertheless , the visibilities of the hom dips obtained in our experiment exceed @xmath50 for all the data collected for the construction of the histograms shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : data ] .     </S>",
    "<S> an example of a hom dip obtained in our experiment for the state @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the visibility , @xmath52 , of the hom dip above is @xmath49 ; other hom dips observed for different polarization states are similar to this one . ]    * data analysis *    here we illustrate how data were analyzed to obtain fig .  3 in the main text . </S>",
    "<S> for the witness family measurement , the first family is chosen at random among the six families . </S>",
    "<S> if the measurement of this family gives a negative value of @xmath27 , the state is detected to be entangled and no further measurement is needed . if the result is inconclusive , then one uses the adaptive scheme to choose the next family , until a conclusive result is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the result is @xmath53 , the number of witness families that have to be measured in order to detect the entanglement ; see table  [ tbl : expl ] for illustrations .    </S>",
