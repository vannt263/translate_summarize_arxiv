    "however , the area compressibility decreases as a function of the system size , as already found in @xcite : this decrease is due to the fact that a larger number of oscillation modes are introduced in the system as its projected area is increased .",

    "the results contained in this paper puts in evidence that in a bilayer membrane , the surface tension @xmath100 appearing in the elasticity hamiltonian ( [ fapp ] ) and the mechanical surface tension @xmath38 are two distinct thermodynamic quantities , which have to be measured independently for a full characterization of the system elastic properties , although for a constrained system , the geometrical constraints impose a relation between them .",
    "it would be interesting to measure these two quantities in a real system , e.g , a lipid vesicle manipulated with a micropipette .",

    "<S> we study the elastic response of bilayer membranes with fixed projected area to both stretching and shape deformations . </S>",

    "<S> thus , both the surface tensions , related to each type of deformation , are measured for the same system . </S>",
    "<S> these surface tensions are found to assume different values in the same bilayer membrane : in particular they vanish for different values of the projected area . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a simple theory which relates the two quantities and successfully apply it to the data obtained with computer simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> bilayer membranes are composed of amphiphilic molecules whose hydrophobic part is strongly insoluble in water . </S>",
    "<S> such molecules tends to form interfaces with the solvent in order to reduce the interfacial energy @xcite : a bilayer is thus formed by two adjacent sheets of amphiphilic molecules separating two aqueous phases . </S>",
    "<S> the interest in such structures resides in the fact that they play an outstanding role in the organization of biological cells : bilayer membranes of lipids form the basic structure of a cell s plasma membrane and of internal membranes , which surround the organelles in eukaryotic cells , such as the nucleus , mitochondria and the golgi apparatus @xcite .    in a fluid membrane fluctuating freely in a solvent , all internal degrees of freedom , related , e.g , to the hydrocarbon chain conformation , and to to the local molecular density , relax on a fast time scale . </S>",
    "<S> the membrane is then characterized by a zero shear modulus , i.e. any shear deformation induces a flow of the amphiphilic molecules within the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> such a system is then subject to only two types of elastic deformations : bending deformations and stretching deformations . </S>",
    "<S> the first are deformations normal to the membrane plane which change the membrane shapes , while the latter are in - plane deformations which change the local area per molecule projected onto the membrane midplane .    </S>",
    "<S> the surface of a fluctuating membrane can thus be viewed as an interface with the solvent , and we will call _ fluctuation _ surface tension the surface tension of the bilayer membrane associated to shape fluctuations . the surface tension of an interface saturated by surfactant molecules </S>",
    "<S> is expected to vanish ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and thus the fluctuation surface tension of a fluid membrane fluctuating freely in a solvent is usually assumed to be zero . however in the case of a constrained bilayer membrane , such as those fixed on a frame , the geometrical constrain can lead to a non vanishing surface tension . </S>",
    "<S> non vanishing fluctuation surface tension have been observed , e.g. , in @xcite .    on a macroscopic length scale , </S>",
    "<S> a membrane fixed on a frame can be treated as an elastic sheet : if one of the sides of the frame is movable and one tries to change the frame area by pulling or pushing on this side , an elastic force will appear which will tend to restore the preferred value of the frame area . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter describing such elastic behaviour is the _ mechanical _ surface tension and can assume non negative values too @xcite .    intuitively , one would expect that the two surface tensions associated with the two different membrane deformations , namely shape deformation and lateral stretching , are different quantities , see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and discussion therein . </S>",
    "<S> however , in experiments , they are usually measured by observing the one or the other type of deformation , and so one can not compare them experimentally for the same system . on the contrary , the two surface tensions can be measured using computer simulations of model membranes , and this has been done in two previous works @xcite . but in one case , the two surface tensions have been found to be equal within the statistical errors @xcite , while in the other case they have been found to be proportional with respect to each other @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is thus the systematical study and comparison between the fluctuation surface tension and the mechanical surface tension , measured by observing both the types of deformation in the same bilayer membrane . in the present paper we consider bilayer membrane with fixed projected area . </S>",
    "<S> the projected area correspond to the area of the frame in the picture drawn above . by using model bilayer membrane and computer simulations , we measure both the surface tension associated to shape deformation and that associated to stretching deformations . </S>",
    "<S> we show , for the first time , that in the same system these two quantities assume different values , and in particular they do not vanish for the same value of the projected area . the model used here for the computer simulations , </S>",
    "<S> have been largely used in previous works and has been quite successful in describing many dynamic and elastic properties of real bilayer membranes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] , we describe the model bilayer , together with the computer simulation techniques which we use in the present work . in section [ mis_s ] </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the theory of the mechanical surface tension and the method adopted to measure it . </S>",
    "<S> we then show the results for such quantity obtained by computer simulations . in section [ mis_s ] , after reviewing the classical elasticity theory for the shape fluctuations of bilayer membranes , we show the results for the shape fluctuation surface tension , obtained by computer simulations . in section [ compare_sec ] , </S>",
    "<S> the two quantities are compared , and a simple theory which connects them is introduced and discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss our results and conclude in section [ concl ] .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we consider a bilayer membrane made up of @xmath0 amphiphilic molecules , at temperature @xmath1 , spanning a square frame of area @xmath2 , its effective area being @xmath3 . </S>"
