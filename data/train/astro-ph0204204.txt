    "the heavy element enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) provides a valuable constraint on physical processes that play critical roles in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "elements heavier than boron are synthesized in stars ( presumably mostly located within galaxies ) , and understanding how these elements are removed from galaxies and transported into the igm will likely yield insights on galaxy evolution . is the igm enriched by supernova - driven galactic winds , dynamical processes such as tidal or ram - pressure stripping , or all of these mechanisms ?",
    "how does this affect / regulate star formation in galaxies ?",
    "igm enrichment also has cosmological implications .",
    "for example , the processes which deposit heavy elements in the igm will also deposit energy , and this `` feedback '' can have important effects on cosmological structure growth ( e.g. , kaiser 1991 ; ponman , cannon , & navarro 1999 ; cen & bryan 2001 ; voit & bryan 2001 ) .    igm enrichment has been modeled using methods ranging from semi - analytic calculations to hydrodynamic simulations , and a variety of theoretical predictions have been made regarding the heavy element content of intergalactic gas at both high and low redshifts ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1999b ; ferrara , pettini , & shchekinov 2000 ; aguirre et al .",
    "these predictions can be tested using qso absorption lines to estimate the metallicity of the igm in a variety of contexts .",
    "observations of qso absorption - line systems have shown that the high - redshift igm is remarkably - widely enriched with metals ( cowie et al .",
    "1995 ; tytler et al .",
    "1995 ) , and statistical analyses have indicated that this enrichment extends even to the absorbers with the lowest column densities ( ellison et al .",
    "2000 ; schaye et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "recently , high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) uv spectroscopy of 3c 273 with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ has provided an opportunity to probe the igm enrichment within a particularly interesting environment : the virgo cluster / supercluster . in this paper",
    "we derive constraints on the heavy element abundances in two ly@xmath1  clouds in the immediate vicinity of this cluster .",
    "the sight line to 3c 273 extends through the virgo cluster `` southern extension '' ( e.g. , binggeli , popescu , & tammann 1993 ) , although the projected distance from the sight line to m87 and the x - ray region is substantial ( @xmath14 mpc ) . in the 3c 273 spectrum , there are three ly@xmath1  clouds at virgo redshifts ; in this paper we are mainly interested in the virgo absorbers at @xmath2  = 0.00337 and 0.00530 .",
    "the connections between these virgo absorption systems and nearby galaxies have been extensively studied ( see  4.3 ) , but measurements of the metallicities of these ly@xmath1   absorbers have not been previously obtained .",
    "it is now possible to estimate the metal abundances in these virgo ly@xmath1  clouds due to two observational advances .",
    "first , sembach et al . (",
    "2001 ) have presented a surprising result from the _ fuse _ observation : the virgo absorber at @xmath2  = 0.00530 is detected in _ seven _ higher lyman series lines ( ly@xmath15  - ly@xmath4 ) .",
    "this clearly establishes that the column is substantially higher than previously thought ; from a curve - of - growth ( cog ) analysis , sembach et al .",
    "( 2001 ) derive log n ( ) = 15.85@xmath16 , an increase by a factor of more than 40 over the previous estimate based on fitting the profile of ly@xmath1  only .",
    "line at this redshift , hurwitz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) provided the first evidence that the column density of this system was substantially higher than expected based on profile fitting of the ly@xmath1 transition alone .",
    "however , with only ly@xmath1 and ly@xmath15 , they were unable to tightly constrain @xmath17(h i ) and @xmath18 ( see their figure 4 ) . ] more importantly , the column density and doppler parameter are accurately constrained from the cog .",
    "second , the high signal - to - noise stis observations at 7 km s@xmath0  resolution have enabled the detection of very weak lines in the 3c 273 spectrum , including weak lines of , , and at @xmath2  = 0.00530 . in this paper",
    ", we use these weak metal lines and the new measurement to explore the heavy element enrichment of this virgo ly@xmath1   system at @xmath2  = 0.00530 .",
    "we also constrain the metallicity of the lower - redshift virgo ly@xmath1  cloud ( @xmath2  = 0.00337 ) based on the detection of and the absence of .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the new stis observations and absorption line measurements , and we briefly comment on the well - known galaxy structures at virgo redshifts in the vicinity of the 3c 273 sight line . in  3 we model the ionization of the gas and derive constraints on the metallicity , density , and temperature of the ly@xmath1  absorbers .",
    "we discuss the implications of the measurements and the nature of the absorbing gas in  4 , and we summarize the main results in  5 . in the appendix we provide additional details on new galactic ism measurements to supplement the analysis in  4 . throughout the paper ,",
    "we report heliocentric wavelengths and redshifts , km s@xmath0  assuming the standard definition of the local standard of rest ( kerr & lynden- bell 1986 ) . ] and we assume @xmath19 km s@xmath0  mpc@xmath0 and @xmath20 .",
    "observations of 3c 273 were obtained with the e140 m echelle mode of stis , using the @xmath21 aperture , on 2000 may 2 and 2000 june 21 - 22 .",
    "this mode provides a resolution of 7 km s@xmath0  ( fwhm ) and records the spectrum between 1150 and 1700   with only a few small gaps between orders at @xmath22 1615   ( kimble et al .",
    "1998 ; woodgate et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the total integration time was 18.67 ksec , and this resulted in signal - to - noise ratios ranging from @xmath236 to 66 per resolution element .",
    "the data reduction followed standard procedures , including the scattered light correction developed by the stis investigation definition team .",
    "a selected portion of the final spectrum is shown in figure  [ virgolya ] .",
    "this portion of the spectrum spans the wavelength range of ly@xmath1  lines at redshifts within the virgo cluster / supercluster .",
    "hst _ studies have detected two ly@xmath1  clouds within the virgo cluster at high significance levels at @xmath2  = 0.003 and 0.005 , but a third ly@xmath1  absorber at @xmath2  = 0.007 was reported in some studies but not confirmed ( see  3.3.1 of morris et al .",

    "@xmath25 m   is detected at @xmath2  = 0.00745 .",
    "figure  [ virgolya ] also indicates the expected wavelengths of ly@xmath1  lines at the mean redshifts of several virgo galaxy structures near the 3c 273 sight line .",
    "it has long been recognized that there are several large `` clouds '' of galaxies in the immediate vicinity of the virgo cluster that have distinct kinematics and morphologies ( e.g. , de vaucouleurs 1961 ) . according to binggeli , popescu , & tammann ( 1993 ) , the 3c 273 sight line pierces the structures known as the virgo `` southern extension '' ( @xmath26 km s@xmath0 , velocity dispersion @xmath27 km s@xmath0 ) and the virgo w cloud ( @xmath28 km s@xmath0 , @xmath29 = 356 km s@xmath0 ) .",
    "the virgo w cloud is also in this region ( @xmath30 km s@xmath0 , @xmath29 = 301 km s@xmath0 ) .",

    "we note that the model is required to produce the observed column density , log @xmath17 ( ) = 15.85 , and consequently as @xmath73 is increased and the gas becomes more highly ionized , the thickness of the slab is increased to match the observed column .",

    "( 1995 ) with regard to h ionization , local sources of photoionization , such as x - rays from the hot gas in the virgo cluster or uv flux escaping from nearby galaxies , are unlikely to be important compared to photoionization by the background uv flux from qsos .",
    "we confirm that the heavy element results presented above are insensitive to these issues .",
    "for example , if we include x - ray flux from the hot gas ( following  3.1.4 in weymann et al .",
    "1995 ) in the cloudy model , we find only miniscule changes in the column densities of interest compared to figure  [ model ] .",
    "similarly , if we assume that the radiation field is _ dominated _ by the uv flux from stars , we obtain very similar constraints on the heavy element abundances . even lower and column densities",
    "are predicted in this case , so the observational constraints in table  [ lineprop ] are easily satisfied .",
    "however , if stellar flux were competitive with the qso background , the gas density would be higher ; the combined flux from the qso / agn background and the stellar sources leads to a higher photon density , so the gas density must also be higher to produce the same ionization parameter .",
    "we next consider the possibility that the absorption occurs in a multiphase medium in which the , , and lines do not entirely come from the same gas .",
    "as shown in figure  [ multiphase ] , the centroids of these lines ( see also column 5 in table  [ lineprop ] ) marginally support this hypothesis : the and lines are blueshifted by @xmath235 km s@xmath0  compared to the centroid of the absorption .",
    "also , the profile appears to show two components with the weaker component more closely aligned with the and lines .",
    "however , the and lines are very weak and therefore could be misleading due to noise . consequently , we conclude that while there are reasonable indications that this is a multiphase absorption system , this requires confirmation with higher s / n data .",
    "even if the absorber is a multiphase medium , we can still derive useful estimates of the heavy element abundances because the , , and absorption should predominantly originate in the same , lower - ionization , phase . to show this , we plot in figure  [ ionfracs ] the ion fractions of , , , and vs. log @xmath73 from the same model shown in figure  [ model ] .",
    "we also show the gas temperature predicted by the model over this range of @xmath73 . from this figure",

    "the bulk of the detected in higher lyman series lines should be affiliated with the / gas .",
    "however , the higher - ionization -bearing gas may produce weaker absorption that may be detectable in the ly@xmath1  transition ( unless it is confined to the strongly saturated portion of the ly@xmath1  profile ) .",
    "more importantly , it is evident from figure  [ ionfracs ] that some arising in the / phase is likely to be detectable , and this may explain the indications of a weaker component in the profile at the velocity of the and lines .",
    "the column density of this weaker component is poorly constrained due to blending of the two components and the s / n of the data , but fitting two components to the profile with the fitzpatrick & spitzer ( 1997 ) profile - fitting code and the line spread functions from the stis handbook ( leitherer et al .",

    "however , at higher s / n levels , and/or absorption associated with this more highly ionized component should be detectable .",
    "it is possible that some of the absorption that we have already detected is associated with the more highly ionized extra component .",
    "if so , then we have overestimated [ c / h ] and we have underestimated [ si / c ] . decreasing [ c / h ] and increasing [ si / c ] to compensate for",
    "this would only strengthen our interpretation of the nature of this absorber (  4 ) .",
    "the model has some interesting implications . with these constraints on @xmath93 ,",
    "the model predicts @xmath94 k ( see figure  [ ionfracs ] ) , and the cloud pressure @xmath95 k @xmath10 . however , the thickness of the gas slab is only @xmath2370 pc for log @xmath96 .",
    "this is vastly smaller than expected for a gravitationally confined ly@xmath1  cloud with an ordinary ratio of baryons to dark matter ; a photoionized , self - gravitating cloud with log @xmath17 ( ) = 15.85 , the inferred temperature , and a gas fraction @xmath97 would be several orders of magnitude larger ( see schaye 2001 ) .",
    "the inferred absorber thickness is somewhat sensitive to the ionization parameter .",
    "for example , if we decrease the density to log @xmath93 = @xmath98 ( i.e. , log @xmath99 ) , then the thickness increases to @xmath100 pc .",
    "this is still much smaller than expected for a self - gravitating cloud .",
    "the cloud mass is uncertain due to the unknown geometry and impact parameter .",
    "if spherical , the cloud has a rather small baryonic mass on the order of @xmath101 m@xmath78 , but the mass could be substantially larger with other geometries .",
    "similar properties have recently been derived for a subset of weak systems at @xmath102 1 ( rigby , charlton , & churchill 2002 ) .    the small line - of - sight size implied by the model indicates that either ( 1 ) the fraction of the absorber mass in the form of baryonic gas is extremely small ( @xmath103 ) , ( 2 ) the absorber is pressure - confined by an external medium , or ( 3 ) the gas is out of equilibrium and will rapidly expand or evaporate .",
    "a small @xmath104 could arise in a small dark matter halo that expelled most of its gas in an early episode of star formation .",
    "mac low & ferrara ( 1999 ) have shown that sn can expel most of the ism from a very low - mass object .",
    "alternatively , the baryons may have been photoevaporated from a small dark matter halo during the reionization epoch ( e.g. , klypin et al . 1999 ; barkana & loeb 1999 ) . assuming the current gas mass is @xmath105 m@xmath78 ,",
    "the required @xmath106 would imply that the mass of the dark matter halo is @xmath107 m@xmath78 .",
    "a substantial fraction of the gas can be removed from a dark matter halo in this mass range ( see references above ) .",
    "however , the baryon removal process must be remarkably efficient , and the gas which remains in the dark matter halo must be in a relatively quiescent state ( there is some evidence of component structure in the absorption lines , but the profiles are quite simple compared to many qso absorption systems ) . furthermore , the fact that the baryonic mass ( and therefore the implied dark matter halo mass ) could be substantially higher with other ( perhaps more likely ) geometries such as a filament or sheet makes baryon evacuation more difficult and the required @xmath106 value more improbable .",
    "it seems more likely that the absorber is pressure confined by an external medium . for purposes of illustration ,",
    "figure  [ lya005 ] shows how the ly@xmath1  profile at @xmath2  = 0.00530 can easily accomodate a broad component with a @xmath108value as large as 41 km s@xmath0 .",
    "if due to the external confining medium , this broad - component doppler parameter implies that @xmath109 k , and therefore the external medium would need a density @xmath110 @xmath10 to confine the metal - bearing gas with the pressure derived above .",
    "this is a plausible density for a galaxy halo or the intracluster medium in a galaxy group .",
    "however , the fit shown in figure  [ lya005 ] is not unique , and it is possible that a substantially broader component is present . a sufficiently broad and weak component could be hidden in the noise , particularly since the strength of such a feature could be inadvertently reduced by the continuum fitting process .",
    "consequently , @xmath111 could be substantially higher and @xmath112 accordingly lower .",
    "we now constrain the metallicity of the 3c 273 ly@xmath1  cloud at @xmath2  = 0.00337 , first assuming the gas is collisionally ionized (  3.2.1 ) , and then considering the possibility that it is photoionized (  3.2.2 ) .",

    "this interpretation has interesting implications .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath85group elements , including silicon , are overabundant relative to iron by roughly 0.3 dex in low metallicity stars in various locations in the milky way ( wheeler et al .",
    "1989 ; mcwilliam 1997 , and references therein ) . following tinsley ( 1979 ) , this is generally believed to indicate that the heavy element enrichment is dominated by the output from type ii supernovae ( sn ii ) .",
    "the nucleosynthetic origins of carbon are somewhat complex , and carbon abundance trends in stars are highly uncertain , but mcwilliam ( 1997 ) notes that there are no compelling indications that c is overabundant ( relative to fe ) in low - metallicity galactic halo stars .",
    "furthermore , some galactic chemical evolution models can produce overabundances of si relative to c , with [ si / c ] as high as @xmath230.5 ( e.g. , timmes et al .",
    "therefore there is reason to expect [ si / c ] @xmath23 0.3 in low - metallicity objects such as this virgo ly@xmath1  cloud .",
    "there is also long - standing evidence that @xmath85group elements are overabundant ( with respect to iron ) in the x - ray emitting hot intracluster medium ( icm ) in several clusters including virgo ( e.g. , canizares et al .",
    "1982 ; mushotzky et al .",
    "1996 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "this has usually been ascribed to galactic winds driven predominantly by sn ii ( e.g. , loewenstein & mushotzky 1996 , but see the discussion of caveats in gibson , loewenstein , & mushotzky 1997 ) .",
    "more recent analyses have concluded that the fe abundances increase in the central regions of several clusters while the @xmath85group abundances remain more - or - less constant ( e.g. , finoguenov , david , & ponman 2000 ; kaastra et al .",
    "this likely indicates that ejecta from type ia sn contribute to the icm enrichment in the central regions where the cd and other old elliptical galaxies are located , but sn ii ejecta from early `` protogalactic '' winds dominate the enrichment in the rest of the icm .",
    "the sight line to 3c 273 is @xmath176 away ( i.e. , projected distance @xmath177 mpc ) from m87 and the x - ray emitting icm in the virgo cluster .",
    "consequently , it is interesting that the virgo ly@xmath1  absorber at @xmath2  = 0.00530 also shows evidence of an overabundance of one of the @xmath1 elements .",
    "this may indicate that the early sn ii winds affect a very broad region of the cluster , a region much more extended than the easily observed hot gas .",
    "this also has implications for the issues briefly noted in  1 .",
    "for example , if the intergalactic gas within virgo is enriched by dynamical processes such as ram - pressure stripping , the abundance patterns should reflect a significant contribution from sn ia ( gunn & gott 1972 ) .",
    "the observation of sn ii abundance patterns favors supernova driven winds as the source of enrichment .",
    "furthermore , if the @xmath2  = 0.00530 absorber is a small blob entrained in the hot gas of a galactic wind , then the hotter wind gas could provide the pressure required to confine the absorber , as discussed in  3.1 .",
    "we note that analogous abundance trends have been observed in other contexts in low- and high - redshift absorption systems .",
    "for example , richter et al . (",
    "2001 ) have measured abundances in the high - velocity cloud ( hvc ) complex c near the milky way using absorption lines detected in the spectrum of pg1259 + 593 and a well - constrained cog .",
    "they report [ o / h ] = @xmath178 , [ si / h ] = @xmath179 , and [ fe / h ] = @xmath180 .",
    "it is interesting to note the overabundance ( albeit marginal ) of the @xmath85group elements o and si with respect to fe in this object which , based on its large angular extent , is probably relatively close to the galaxy ( @xmath181 10 kpc ; wakker et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this case",
    "the abundance trends could be entirely due to dust , which depletes iron more strongly than o and si and can thereby mimic @xmath1 overabundances .",
    "the virgo absorber at @xmath2  = 0.00530 could be analogous to this hvc , although its column density is substantially lower .",
    "there is also evidence of @xmath85group overabundances in high - redshift damped ly@xmath1  absorption systems ( e.g. , lu et al . 1995 , 1996 ; prochaska & wolfe 1999 ) . in comparisons of this virgo ly@xmath1  absorber to higher redshift systems , it is important to note that low@xmath182 and high@xmath182 absorbers with the same @xmath17 ( ) are probably not dynamically equivalent .",
    "in cosmological simulations , a ly@xmath1  system with a given column density at @xmath102 0 has the same overdensity as a system at @xmath102 3 with a larger @xmath17 ( ) by a factor of @xmath23 50 ( dav et al .",
    "therefore this virgo ly@xmath1  absorber may be more analogous to a lyman limit system at high redshift .",
    "however , damped ly@xmath1  and lyman limit absorbers are generally thought to be associated with individual galaxies . despite its location within the virgo supercluster ( or perhaps because of this ) , it is difficult to attribute the @xmath2  = 0.00530 system to such a galaxy . after the virgo ly@xmath1  absorbers in the 3c 273 spectrum were discovered ( morris et al .",

    "ugc 7549 is notable only because it is the brightest galaxy in the vicinity of 3c 273 ; in other respects it appears to be an ordinary spiral galaxy .",

    "this object is intriguing because the envelope has a complex , two - component morphology , and the dwarf galaxy shows regions of active star formation ( giovanelli , williams , & haynes 1991 ) .",
    "this is the type of galaxy that may be able drive a wind with which the @xmath2  = 0.00530 system could be associated ( see heckman et al .",
    "2001 for an observational example of such a wind ) .",
    "theuns , mo , & schaye ( 2001 ) have suggested that dwarf galaxy winds `` may break up into clouds , which coast to large distances [ @xmath23300 kpc ] without sweeping up a significant fraction of the igm . ''",
    "the small size and mass derived for the @xmath2  = 0.00530 ly@xmath1  cloud is qualitatively consistent with this suggestion , and as noted above , a small cloud entrained in a wind could be naturally pressure confined . however , while it is tempting to assign the gas in this absorber to one of these galaxies , we see no clear method to determine which one , if any , is the correct assignment . given the complex velocity field within the virgo cluster , it remains possible that some of these galaxies are interlopers , i.e. , the three - dimensional distances from the ly@xmath1  cloud to the galaxies are larger than implied by their velocity differences .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence that the two 3c 273 absorbers in virgo and their nearest galaxies are part of a large - scale filament ( penton et al .",
    "2001 ) , in which case the absorption line system may not be associated with any particular galaxy but rather is part of the general intragroup gas .",
    "lacking a specific galaxy to which this absorption system can clearly be assigned , it is interesting to consider whether this virgo absorber might be a relatively pristine gas cloud that has only been enriched by a putative first generation of stars , i.e. , the `` population iii '' stars ( e.g. , qian , sargent , & wasserburg 2002 ) . using the population iii yields calculated by heger & woosley ( 2002 ) , oh et al .",

    "given the low equivalent width , this absorber may not be located in the _ typical _ low- overdensity environment expected based on the cosmological simulations ( see , e.g. , figure 4 in cen et al .",
    "2001 ) , but this is only one case , and it is quite likely that analogous systems can be found in the simulations . like the @xmath2  = 0.00530 system",
    ", there are no galaxies very near the sight line at @xmath2  = 0.00337 ( hoffman et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) , and it is not clear whether or not this absorber is in a virialized region .",
    "additional galaxy redshift measurements currently underway ( k. mclin et al .",
    ", in preparation ) will help illuminate the nature of this absorption system .",
    "other absorbers at higher redshifts have line properties similar to the @xmath2  = 0.00337 system , e.g. , similar lower limits on / and evidence of broad components in the ly@xmath1  profiles ( e.g. , tripp & savage 2000 ; tripp et al .",
    "2001 ; savage et al .",
    "it is interesting to note that in all of these absorbers , the broad lines are juxtaposed with at least one narrow line .",
    "this might be expected if the broad - component gas was shock - heated as high - velocity gas collided with the lower - ionization gas that gives rise to the observed narrow component . on the other hand ,",
    "if the broad component is due to hubble broadening over a long pathlength ( as may be required if the is photoionized , see tripp et al .",
    "2001 ) , then there is no particular reason to expect the observed correspondence between the broad and narrow lines .",
    "the 3c 273 system at @xmath2  = 0.00337 is particularly valuable for understanding these absorbers because the low redshift allows an intensive investigation of the absorber environment , and because the qso is the brightest known .",
    "we have obtained good constraints on the abundances of carbon and silicon in a ly@xmath1  absorption system at @xmath2  = 0.00530 in the spectrum of 3c 273 ; this absorber is located within the southern extension of the virgo cluster .",
    "based on ionization modeling , we find that the carbon abundance in the gas phase is roughly 1/15 of the solar abundance , and si , an @xmath85element , is overabundant relative to c by @xmath230.2 dex . the h density is @xmath196 @xmath10 , the absorber thickness is @xmath2370 pc , and the gas pressure @xmath197 40 @xmath10 k. the small line - of - sight thickness suggests that the absorber is pressure confined by an external medium or is out of equilbrium and will soon expand or evaporate ( a self - gravitating cloud would require a remarkably high dark matter to baryon ratio ) .",
    "the si overabundance is probably not due to dust depletion . instead , this likely reflects an intrinsic abundance pattern .",
    "overabundances of @xmath85group elements have been observed in the hot x - ray emitting gas in the virgo cluster , and these abundance patterns are believed to be produced by galactic winds containing predominantly sn ii ejecta .",
    "we favor such an explanation for this 3c 273 absorber as well because there are no galaxies particularly nearby , as might be expected in other scenarios , but there are galaxies at projected distances of @xmath23200 kpc which could plausibly drive an escaping wind .",
    "the projected distance from the 3c 273 sight line to the region detected in x - rays is @xmath233 mpc , and therefore the putative sn ii winds may be widespread in the virgo cluster .",
    "if this result is found for other sight lines , sn ii winds , perhaps `` protogalactic '' winds , may not be unique to the central regions of clusters and may in fact be a general phenomenon in galaxies .",
    "detections of other heavy elements in this absorber will require substantial improvements in the s / n of the spectrum ( at the same resolution ) .",
    "perhaps the most promising transition to search for in future observations is the strongest transition at 2382.8  .",
    "we have also estimated the metallicity of the ly@xmath1/ absorber at @xmath2  = 0.00337 in the 3c 273 spectrum .",
    "we obtain [ o / h ] @xmath132 from photoionized as well as collisionally ionized models .",
    "if the gas is collisionally ionized , then the lower limit on the / ratio requires @xmath198 k in the phase .",
    "several other sight lines to qsos behind the virgo supercluster have recently been observed or will be observed during the next year with the stis e140 m echelle mode .",
    "for example , it will be useful to examine the sight line to rxj1230.8 + 0115 ( read , miller , & hasinger 1998 ) , which is only 54 from 3c 273 .",
    "these nearby sight lines will likely provide additional valuable constraints on the heavy element enrichment of the igm .",
    "we are indebted to gary ferland and collaborators for the construction of cloudy , and for making the code freely available .",
    "we also thank jane charlton , john mulchaey , bill oegerle , joop schaye , and especially ken sembach for helpful comments .",
    "this research was supported by nasa grant nas5 - 26555 .",
    "tmt acknowledges additional support from nasa ltsa grant nag5 - 11136 .",
    "as discussed in  4 , there are relatively few galactic interstellar clouds in which the column densities have both been reliably measured .",
    "this is primarily because @xmath17 ( ) is difficult to measure in the milky way ism ; the resonance transitions are usually very badly saturated , and when the spin - changing ] @xmath312325 line is detectable , the corresponding resonance transitions are strongly saturated .",
    "there is a spin - changing ] transition at 2335   that can be observed when the ] @xmath312325 line is detected .",
    "however , detection of these semiforbidden transitions is challenging , and they have mainly been observed in sight lines such as @xmath137 oph through relatively dense clouds .    the recent high - resolution survey of interstellar absorption lines carried out by jenkins & tripp ( 2001 ) has fortuitously revealed a few additional high - velocity interstellar clouds in the spectra of two stars , hd116781a and hd122879 , in which @xmath17 ( ) and @xmath17 ( ) can both be accurately measured .",
    "the continuum - normalized and absorption profiles of these high - velocity features are shown in figure  [ mw116781 ] . due to the very high resolution of the spectra ( @xmath199 ) ,",
    "it is unlikely that these high - velocity lines are affected by unresolved saturation .",
    "consequently , we can obtain reliable column density measurements . in the direction of hd116781a , at least two components are readily apparent in the high velocity gas .",
    "to deblend these components and obtain their individual column densities , we have used the profile- fitting software of fitzpatrick & spitzer ( 1997 ) with the line - spread function for this slit from the stis handbook .",
    "the heliocentric velocities , doppler parameters , and column densities obtained in this way are summarized in table  [ mwlineprop ] .",
    "table  [ mwism ] reports the [ si / c ] values derived from these column densities .",
    "there may be evidence of additional components in these profiles , but these additional components are not sufficiently well - constrained to justify addition of more lines to the fits .",
    "we note that due to the weakness of the line , the wings of the profile in the hd122879 spectrum might be lost in the noise .",
    "this could lead to underestimates of the @xmath65value and @xmath17 ( ) in this cloud .",
    "based on apparent column density ratios and fits to the line forced to take on larger @xmath108values , we estimate that log @xmath17 ( ) might be underestimated by 0.2 dex .",
    "the error bars in table  [ mwism ] reflect this source of uncertainty .",
    "a full discussion of the nature of these high - velocity features is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , a few comments are in order .",
    "( 1 ) the absorption lines occur at velocities well outside the velocity range expected for normal galactic rotation in these directions ( see table 2 in jenkins & tripp 2001 ) , i.e. , these are `` forbidden - velocity '' clouds . ( 2 ) the [ si / c ] abundances derived from the two high - velocity components toward hd116781a are quite similar ( and consistent with the same value within the 1@xmath29 uncertainties ; see table  [ mwism ] ) , but there are large differences in [ si / c ] toward hd116781a and hd122879 at @xmath200 km s@xmath0  ( see table  [ mwism ] ) .",
    "it seems unlikely that these differences are due to intrinsic changes in the interstellar abundances given the spatial separation between the sight lines ( @xmath23190 pc at the estimated distance of hd116781a ) . as discussed in  4 , it is possible that some of the differences in [ si / c ] are driven by ionization .",
    "the differences between the hd116781a and hd122879 sight lines are dramatic ; @xmath17 ( ) is only @xmath230.3 dex smaller toward hd122879 , but the column density is reduced by an order of magnitude . based on the modeling of sembach et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , such large changes can not be attributed to ionization effects if the gas is predominantly photoionized . however",
    ", this could occur if the gas is predominantly collisionally ionized ( see sutherland & dopita 1993 ) and the gas temperature exceeds @xmath2315,000 k. this would not be surprising since these clouds may well be shock - heated , given their large departures from normal galactic rotation .",
    "in addition , some of the differences in [ si / c ] between the sight lines may be due to more substantial dust grain destruction in the direction of hd116781a .",
    "this could occur if silicon is incorporated into more fragile portions of dust grains while c is locked into more resilient dust components .",

    "<S> we model the ionization of the gas and derive [ c / h ] = @xmath5 , [ si / c ] = @xmath6 , and log @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the model implies a small absorber thickness , @xmath8 pc , and thermal pressure @xmath9 @xmath10 k. it is most likely that the absorber is pressure confined by an external medium because gravitational confinement would require a very high ratio of dark matter to baryonic matter . </S>",
    "<S> based on a sample of milky way sight lines in which carbon and silicon abundances have been reliably measured in the same interstellar cloud ( including new measurements presented herein ) , we argue that it is unlikely that the overabundance of si relative to c is due to depletion onto dust grains . </S>",
    "<S> instead , this probably indicates that the gas has been predominately enriched by ejecta from type ii supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> such enrichment is most plausibly provided by an unbound galactic wind , given the absence of known galaxies within a projected distance of 100 kpc and the presence of galaxies capable of driving a wind at larger distances ( e.g. , 1225 + 01 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such processes have been invoked to explain the observed abundances in the hot , x - ray emitting gas in virgo . </S>",
    "<S> however , the sight line to 3c 273 is more than 10@xmath11 away from the x - ray emission region . </S>",
    "<S> we also constrain the metallicity and physical conditions of the virgo absorber at @xmath2  = 0.00337 in the spectrum of 3c 273 based on detections of and and an upper limit on . if this absorber is collisionally ionized , the / limit requires @xmath12 k in the -bearing gas . for either collisional ionization or photoionization </S>",
    "<S> , we find that [ o / h ] @xmath13 at @xmath2  = 0.00337 . </S>"
