    "it is amazing how a topic as classic as string mechanics , which has been tended for centuries , may still surprise and challenge us with unsolved problems .",
    "this is the case for the _ chain fountain _ , the anomalous behaviour of a chain falling under gravity which has already fascinated the millions who viewed the movie of s. mould  @xcite , myself included . in words ,",
    "one end of a long metal chain sitting in a pot is raised above the pot s rim and let fall towards the floor .",
    "contrary to everybody s expectation , in most experimental circumstances , the chain instead of falling straight down climbs appreciably higher than the pot s rim before falling , thus drawing a steady curve in space which resembles a fountain s spray .",
    "chains , cords , and strings have been the object of theoretical mechanics since 16141615 when , according to truesdell  @xcite , beeckman is likely to have found that the equilibrium shape of a string uniformly loaded along a line ( such as a suspension bridge ) is a parabolic arc .",
    "james bernoulli is usually credited with the discovery of the analytic form for the equilibrium shape of a chain under gravity , called the _",
    "catenary _ from the latin word for chain .",
    "more recently , that is to say , in the late 19th century , it was remarked by airy  @xcite that the catenary is also the steady shape of a string being drawn at constant speed , the passage from equilibrium to steady motion only resulting in offsetting uniformly the string s tension by a quantity proportional to the velocity square .",
    "plenty of historical remarks illuminating the pedigree of this problem can also be found in the papers by biggins and warner  @xcite , upon which i further elaborate in this work .    that an arc of inverted catenary is also the steady shape of a falling chain there can be no doubt .",
    "the boundary conditions to which such an arc is subjected are essential to the understanding of the dynamics of chain fountains , and here opinions may differ .",
    "biggins and warner  @xcite proposed that the chain is actually lifted up at the detach point and pulled down at the deposition point , the corresponding forces being produced by the pot and the floor , respectively .",
    "several arguments are given in @xcite that reduce both forces to elementary physical mechanisms involving the nature and shape of the links constituting the chain .",
    "suggestive as these arguments may be , they eventually result in separate constitutive assumptions for the tension @xmath0 of the chain at the pickup and putdown points , which read as @xmath1 respectively , where @xmath2 is the mass per unit length of the chain , @xmath3 is the velocity at which it is drawn , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are dimensionless parameters .. in , where both ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) of @xcite are combined , the dimensionless parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 appear to be constitutive of both the chain and the environment it comes in contact with . ] according to biggins and warner s explanation , the negative contribution to @xmath8 , @xmath9 , amounts precisely to the reactive upward force exerted by the pot onto the chain s link being set in motion .",
    "contrariwise , the tension @xmath10 , which is exerted on the chain by the heap of links being freely collected at the foot of the fountain , is not required to vanish , as if the terminal link were still freely flying before the impact with the floor , in accord with some recent studies @xcite , which have already advanced theoretically and also confirmed experimentally such a hypothesis .    here",
    "i do not question the validity of , but i want to derive from first principles , expressing both @xmath6 and @xmath7 in terms of a single internal constitutive parameter pertaining only to how the chain is made . the way to achieve this will be by regarding both the pickup and putdown points as standing shocks that dissipate energy at the rate dictated by a classical law for internal impacts . to this end",
    ", we need first recall the theory of shocks in one - dimensional continua .",
    "luckily this task is made easy by a paper of oreilly and varadi  @xcite who , elaborating on earlier work of green and naghdi  @xcite , proposed an elegant and rather comprehensive theory , which in sec .",
    "[ sec : shocks ] is applied to the case at hand .",
    "section  [ sec : shocks ] , which is the heart of the paper , is split in several subsections to make it easier for the reader retrace the different elements of the theory developed here .",
    "the discussion proposed in the final sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] draws a closer comparison with the theory of biggins and warner and indicates further possible applications of the present theory .",
    "think of a chain as an _ inextensible _ string with uniform mass density @xmath2 per unit length , parameterized in the reference configuration by the arc - length @xmath11 . the position in space occupied by a material point of the string is represented by the mapping @xmath12 .",
    "here @xmath11 , which designates the convected variable , could as well be used to designate the arc - length in the present configuration .",
    "correspondingly , the velocity @xmath13 is defined by @xmath14 , where a superimposed dot represents differentiation with respect to time @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , @xmath16 is the acceleration .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the _ external _ force acting per unit length of the string and @xmath18 the internal tension that arises as a reaction to the inextensibility constraint .",
    "the balance of linear momentum along any smooth arc of the string is expressed by @xmath19 where a prime @xmath20 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath11 ( see , for example , ( * ? ? ? * sec.34 ) ) .      in this context , a _ shock _ propagating along the string is described by a function , @xmath21 , identifying the point in the reference configuration carrying a discontinuity in speed ( and acceleration ) . specifically , we assume that @xmath22 is continuous at @xmath23 , because the string breaks nowhere , but @xmath13 is discontinuous .",
    "similarly , both the unit tangent @xmath24 , the principal unit normal @xmath25 , and the curvature @xmath26 of the curve representing the present shape ( at time @xmath15 ) of the string are discontinuous at @xmath27 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : shock ] .     of the string .",
    "the points @xmath28 and @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , delimit the arc under consideration .",
    "the point @xmath31 is a singular point , where the unit tangent @xmath24 is discontinuous , with traces @xmath32 and @xmath33 on the two sides . ]",
    "we shall call @xmath31 a _ singular point_. we denote by @xmath32 and @xmath33 the two limiting values of @xmath24 across a singular point . here and below , for any quantity @xmath34 , superscripts @xmath35 refer to the traces of @xmath34 across @xmath31 from the sides of increasing and decreasing @xmath11 , respectively . also , we shall employ the customary notation @xmath36 , for the _ jump _ of @xmath34 across a singular point .",
    "the shock speed is @xmath37 relative to both the reference and present shapes ( as a consequence of the string s inextensibility ) .",
    "a kinematic compatibility condition arises for the jumps of both @xmath13 and @xmath38 , as a result of the requirement that both the velocity and acceleration of the geometric point which instantaneously coincides in space with a singular point can be expressed in two different , but equivalent ways ( see , for example , @xcite ) :    [ eq : kinematic_compatibility ] @xmath39 @xmath40    the balance of linear momentum for an arbitrary small arc enclosing a singular point ( that is , for @xmath41 and @xmath42 in fig .",
    "[ fig : shock ] ) , requires that @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the concentrated supply of momentum that must be provided at a singular point to sustain the shock . in a similar way ( see again @xcite for more details ) , the energy balance at a singular point results into the following equation , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the concentrated power supply involved in the shock . of @xcite ; what here is denoted @xmath46 was there denoted @xmath47 . for @xmath48 , energy is lost in the shock . according to sommerfeld s book @xcite ( see , pp.2829 and problem i.7",
    ", pp.241 , 257 ) , the energy loss in chain dynamics is a concept first introduced by lazare carnot , the father of sadi ( this latter known for his contributions to the theory of heat ) , who was a writer on mathematics and mechanics ( besides later becoming one of the most loyal of napoleon s generals ) . see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . ] for a dissipative shock , @xmath46 is negative and measures the energy lost per unit time by the internal frictions that hamper the shock as it goes by . while in our setting the force @xmath44 will be provided through the contact of the chain with the external world , @xmath46 is of a constitutive nature , which needs to be further specified ( see sec .

    "sec : shock_dissipation ] ) .",
    "equations and express only the mechanical balances at a singular point .",
    "the former is also known as the _ rankine - hugoniot _ jump condition for one - dimensional continua @xcite .",
    "interesting versions of the jump conditions in , , and above occur when the string is amorphously quiescent on one side of the shock . in this context ,",
    "for definiteness , we shall refer to such a shock as _",
    "external _ , while the shock described so far will be referred to as _ internal_. an external shock is an attempt at formalizing the notion of _ continually _ imparted impacts introduced in the work of cayley  @xcite ; as such , it is more than just an internal shock with vanishing velocity on one side . at an external shock ,",
    "mass is not conserved , as the string is there in contact with a reservoir , where a shapeless deposit of mass serves as a supply of links abruptly injected one - by - one into the moving string .",
    "more generally , the moving system receives from the external reservoir supplies of mass , linear momentum , and energy , which enter the corresponding balance laws . letting @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and dropping everywhere the superscript @xmath51 to avoid clutter , by the same reasoning leading us to , , and",
    ", we obtain that    [ eq : jump_external_plus ] @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55    where @xmath56 and @xmath57 denote the appropriate supplies",
    ". similar expressions , apart from changing @xmath56 and @xmath57 into their opposite , are obtained if @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "combining , , and , we see that @xmath60 similarly , if at a singular point the string comes instantaneously to a halt , instead of being instantaneously set in motion , equations are replaced by @xmath61    equations and , in particular , allow us to interpret @xmath56 as the _ continuous - impact _ force envisaged by cayley @xcite to describe mechanical systems in which particles of infinitesimal mass are continuously taken into `` connexion '' or are continuously lost . in both cases , an external shock is propagating backwards relative to the string at the same scalar velocity as the material in the string , so that the shock results steady in space .",
    "thus , with the aid of and , we can also phrase in terms of external shocks the dynamics of systems with variable mass , for which cayley  @xcite had proposed an _",
    "ad hoc _ variational principle .",
    "the complementary expressions for @xmath57 give the energy lost ( or gained ) by the string in being either set in motion or brought to a halt instantaneously .",

    "[ sec : energy_balance ] . )      when the shock is internal , that is , the singular point is both followed and preceded by mass in motion , the shock dissipation @xmath46 should depend only on the impact mechanism responsible for the abrupt change in velocity . to posit a constitutive law for @xmath46 ,",
    "we seek inspiration in the laws of impact which were already introduced in 1668 by wallis and wren  @xcite , as recounted , for example in whittaker s treatise @xcite .",
    "when in a system of mass - points all impacts happen to be characterized by the same restitution coefficient @xmath62 , the kinetic energy after a single impact decreases by @xmath63 times the kinetic energy of the _ lost _ motion , the motion that would have been composed with the motion before the impact to reproduce the motion after the impact @xcite . by applying this law to the elementary transfer of mass through the shock suffered by a string , interpreted as an internal impact , we justify setting @xmath64 where @xmath65 will be treated as a phenomenological parameter .",
    ", i note that for a _ plastic _",
    "impact , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , whereas , for a _ perfectly elastic _ impact , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "however , in the absence of a microscopic mechanism illuminating the origin of @xmath46 , these correspondences are purely formal and @xmath70 remains a constitutive parameter of the string . ] in the ideal limit where @xmath71 , the shock is not dissipative . on the other hand , for @xmath67 ,",
    "the shock is maximally dissipative . in practice ,",
    "for a chain @xmath70 should depend on both the material and shape of the constitutive links .",
    "could equally well be regarded as an external energy sink , instead of the energy lost in an internal impact .",
    "the latter interpretation , however , provides a better justification for the explicit law posited in .",
    "moreover , linking @xmath70 to an internal dissipation process makes it constitutive of the string alone , a property that seems to have some experimental ground ( see sec .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] to a possible way of determining @xmath70 experimentally , as i think that recently it has already been found , though perhaps inadvertently .      before solving the balance equations for a fountain chain , we need to specify , albeit in an idealized fashion , both the pickup and putdown mechanisms that we envisage",

    "the dynamics of the smooth arc of a chain fountain is governed by equation , while equations through are to be enforced at the singular points identified above .",
    "we shall seek the solution to the problem within a special class , that of steady motions . to this end , we assume that the trajectory followed by the chain s links is invariable in time and that the spatial velocity field @xmath13 on it takes the form @xmath81 , with @xmath3 constant .    projecting both sides of equation along the tangent @xmath24 , the principal normal @xmath25 and the binormal @xmath82 to the chain s steady shape , we arrive at @xmath83 where @xmath26 is the shape s curvature and @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 are the components of @xmath17 along @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath87 , respectively ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "i have privileged one class of solutions upon possible others , as i believe that that represents more closely the physical nature of the anomalous phenomenon being described by this idealized mathematical model , but the strategy proposed here could easily be applied to find solutions in other classes as well .",
    "thus , treating both @xmath119 and @xmath3 as parameters , only two equations would be missing for the moment .",
    "one comes from the geometric condition @xmath122 which prescribes the total downfall of the chain ( see fig .  [",

    "both the internal and external shocks that feature in the chain fountain solution described above entrain an energy supply , which according to is dissipative for all internal shocks , and by and may be either dissipative or productive for external shocks .",
    "the aim of this closing subsection is evaluating all the energy supplies involved in the solution and showing that , once all contributions are duly accounted for , the total energy is perfectly balanced .",
    "we begin by computing the energy dissipated at the internal shocks steadily residing at @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) , which will be denoted by @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively .",
    "it follows from , , and that @xmath192 where , as above , @xmath110 is given as a function of @xmath149 and @xmath119 through .",
    "likewise , we apply and to the external shocks in @xmath77 and @xmath78 , where , in cayley s language , the chain connects and disconnects , respectively , with the exterior . with the aid of and ,",
    "we write the corresponding energy supplies as    [ eq : w_ast_minus_plus ] @xmath193-\\frac12{\\lambda v^3},\\ ] ] @xmath194    finally , we compute the power @xmath195 expended by the active external force @xmath96 .",
    "it readily follows from that @xmath196 where @xmath8 and @xmath10 are the internal tensions at @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , and use has been made of and .",
    "combining together all the powers in , , and , we see that they add up to zero identically , in accord with the fact that for a steady solution the total kinetic energy @xmath197 is constant , and so the total balance of energy requires that @xmath198    a final comment is perhaps wanted about the sign of the powers obtained above . clearly , @xmath195 is positive , whereas both @xmath190 and @xmath191 are negative , as expected . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath199 is positive , indicating that energy is put into the system to produce a continuously instantaneous deposition of links ; such an energy gain is exactly compensated by a loss involved in the specular pickup of links , as indicated by , where however @xmath200 may have other sign , without affecting the total balance .",
    "i had promised in the introduction that i would relate the phenomenological coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 in to a single constitutive parameter .",
    "i am now in a position to fulfill that promise .",
    "combining together and , and comparing with the expressions for the tensions @xmath8 and @xmath10 thus obtained , we readily see that @xmath201 which express @xmath6 and @xmath7 in terms of one constitutive parameter , @xmath70 , and the kinematic parameters @xmath162 of the solution . as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : shock_resolution ] , these latter may also be related through @xmath170 and @xmath171 in to the friction coefficients @xmath165 and @xmath166 , which unlike @xmath70 can be viewed as external coupling parameters .",
    "alternatively , it easily follows from that @xmath202 by using in the values @xmath203 and @xmath204 measured in @xcite together with the angle @xmath205 , for which fig .",
    "5 of @xcite shows the best agreement between predicted and observed shapes of the chain , we readily obtain that @xmath206 and @xmath207 . while the latter agrees qualitatively with the shapes observed in @xcite ,",
    "the former is a first indirect measurement of @xmath70 .",
    "i also alluded to the possibility that @xmath70 might have already been measured for some special chains .",
    "this indeed emerges from reading the work of hamm and gminard  @xcite in the context of the theory presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : shocks ] .",
    "hamm and gminard revisited an old problem for a special system with variable mass : the dynamics of a straight chain falling vertically under gravity and accumulating on the pan of a scale .",
    "they observed experimentally that the free tip of the chain falls with an acceleration greater than the acceleration of gravity @xmath97 and proposed an equation to describe this motion featuring a dimensionless parameter , @xmath208 , which was determined by fitting the experimental data . for a ball chain",
    ", they found @xmath209 and for a loop chain , @xmath210 .",
    "moreover , they argued that `` it might be tempting to interpret @xmath208 as characterizing the dissipation at the bottom .",
    "however , the values of @xmath208 measured for a hard and a soft surface are the same '' and concluded that @xmath208 `` must depend on the structure of the chain '' .",
    "now , their equation of motion ( 5 ) can also be obtained by interpreting as a dissipative shock the kink at the bottom where the chain impinges on the scale s pan . subjecting this shock to",
    ", one easily gives the balance equation of linear momentum the same form ( 5 ) of @xcite , with their @xmath208 just equal to our @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "that dissipation plays a crucial role in these problems is clearly witnessed by the explicit solution obtained in sec .  [ sec : shocks ] , in which the limit as @xmath71 is highly singular and would break the required compatibility conditions , such as .",
    "another feature of the complete solution for the chain problem given here has been observed as well , though only qualitatively .",
    "it is apparent from the movies in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the chain being picked up exerts a backward force on the rows of chain being sucked in , a force which eventually sets the latter in motion .",
    "for such a force , now delivers an explicit expression .",
    "it is my hope that this and the other explicit details of the solution found here could prompt an experimental validation of the theory , whose main hypothesis is the existence in a chain of the internal dissipative shocks described by ."
