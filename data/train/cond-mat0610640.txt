    "the theoretical description of the physical properties of strongly correlated electrons in an external time - dependent electric field is an important problem in condensed matter physics .",
    "one reason is the potential for using strongly correlated materials in electronics , due to their tunability .",
    "these materials have unusual and interesting properties , which can be modified by slightly varying physical parameters , like temperature , pressure , or carrier concentration .",
    "for example , the conductance of nanoelectronic devices can be controlled by tuning the carrier concentration and applying an electric field@xcite . moreover , because of the small size of nanoelectronic devices , an electric potential of the order of @xmath2 produces electric fields on the order of @xmath3 or higher .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the response of such systems to a strong electric field .",
    "recent progress in nanotechnology has resulted in many experimental results on strongly correlated electron nanostructures in time - dependent electric fields which must also be understood .",
    "one such system is the quantum dot , which can be described by a kondo impurity attached to two leads , through two tunnel junctions@xcite .",
    "other examples of important experiments on strongly correlated systems in time - dependent electric fields include an unusually strong change in the optical transmission in the transition metal oxide@xcite @xmath4 . and the dielectric breakdown of a mott insulator that occurs in the quasi - one - dimensional cuprates @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , when a strong electric field is applied @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , since most electron devices have nonlinear current - voltage characteristics , it is important to understand how electron correlations will modify this effect .    due to the complexity of these problems , there is a dearth of theoretical results on different models available .",
    "similar to equilibrium , the simplest cases to analyze are the one - dimensional case and the approximation of infinite dimensions , where dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) can be applied .",
    "the zero dimensional problem ( quantum dot ) in the case of a kondo impurity coupled to two leads , or sources of electrons , has also been studied by different groups . in particular , the case of a single - impurity anderson model was examined in refs .   and",
    "a bethe ansatz approach with open boundary conditions has now been developed for similar problems@xcite .",
    "an attempt to describe optical transmission experiments@xcite in @xmath6 was performed in the framework of the one - dimensional two - band hubbard model , where the problem on a twelve site periodic ring was solved exactly . in ref .  , the spectral properties of the hubbard model coupled to a periodically time varying chemical potential were studied to second order in the coulomb repulsion with iterated perturbation theory . the possibility of the breakdown of a mott insulator in the 1d hubbard model was discussed in ref .   by numerically solving the time - dependent schroedinger equation for the many - body wave function .",
    "the electrical and the spectral properties of the infinite - dimensional spinless falicov - kimball model in an external homogeneous electric field have also been examined .",
    "the spinless falicov - kimball model is one of the simplest models for strongly correlated electrons that acquires the main features of a correlated electron system .",
    "it consists of two kinds of electrons : conducting @xmath7-electrons and localized @xmath8-electrons .",
    "these two different electrons interact through an on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "the model can be regarded as a simplified version of the hubbard model , where the spin - up ( @xmath7 ) electrons move in the background of the frozen spin - down ( @xmath8 ) electrons .",
    "the falicov - kimball model was originally introduced as a model to describe valence - change and metal - insulator transitions@xcite , and later was interpreted as a model for crystallization or binary alloy formation@xcite .",
    "much progress has been made on solving this model with dmft in equilibrium , where essentially all properties of the conduction electrons in equilibrium are known ( for a review , see ref .  ) .",
    "we have already studied the nonequilibrium response of the conduction electrons in the falicov - kimball model to a uniform electric field turned on at a particular moment of time with an exact numerical dmft formalism@xcite .",
    "we solved a system of generalized nonequilibrium dmft equations for the electron green function and self - energy and found interesting effects caused by the electric field . in particular",
    ", we saw how the conduction - electron density of states ( dos ) evolved from a wannier - stark ladder of delta functions at the bloch frequencies to broadened peaks with maxima located away from the bloch frequencies .",
    "another interesting phenomenon we found was that the bloch oscillations of the electric current can survive out to long times in the interacting case , when the amplitude of the electric field is large .",
    "these results were determined by numerically solving a system of the equations for the green function and self - energy defined on a complex time contour ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : keldysh ] ) , according to the kadanoff - baym - keldysh nonequilibrium green function formalism@xcite .",
    "the numerical results were obtained for a finite time interval because computer resources restrict the contour to be a finite length .",
    "therefore , the steady state could not be rigorously reached .",
    "our original motivation for this work , was to find a simple perturbation theory that could reach the steady state , at least for weak electron - electron interactions .",
    "surprisingly , we found that a transient - based perturbation theory breaks down once the time becomes larger than @xmath1 , as described in detail below . nevertheless , even though the perturbation theory can not give a definite answer about the steady state of the system",
    ", it does allow us to study the physical properties of the system in the transient regime , and for small @xmath0 , we can extend the work farther than can be done with the exact numerical techniques . therefore , it might help us understand the evolution of the system toward the steady state in the case when the electron correlations are weak . in this contribution",
    ", we calculate the response of the falicov - kimball model to an external electric field by calculating the strictly truncated electron self - energy to second order in @xmath0 .",
    "we focus on the time - dependence of the electric current and the density of states in the case of a constant electric field turned on at time @xmath9 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we define the problem in section ii and introduce the nonequilibrium dynamical mean - field theory formalism to solve it in section iii . in section iv , the expressions for the nonequilibrium green functions are derived .",
