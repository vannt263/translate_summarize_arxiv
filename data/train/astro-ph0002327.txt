    "her x-1 is a 1.24 second period accretion - powered x - ray pulsar in a 1.7 day circular orbit with a normal stellar companion , hz her .",
    "in addition to these basic periodicities this binary system has long been known to display an unusual 35-day long cycle of high and low x - ray flux states . within a single 35-day cycle",
    "are found a main high and short high x - ray flux state lasting roughly ten and five days each respectively and separated by ten day long low states ( see e.g. scott & leahy 1999 ) .",
    "pulsations are detected during the high states but cease during the intervening low states .",
    "the high states are punctuated by deep x - ray eclipses every 1.7 days indicating a line - of - sight close to the binary plane .",
    "a phenomenon currently known to exist only in her x-1 is a repeating , systematic evolution of the pulse profile that occurs during the 35-day cycle .",

    ", we present a simple phenomenological model for the pulse evolution based upon the occultation of the central x - ray source by the inner edge of a tilted , precessing , accretion disk .",
    "this choice is motivated by the observed association of pulse shape changes with _",
    "decreases _ in overall x - ray flux near the end of the main high state ( see scott 1993 ; scott et al . 1997a ; deeter et al . 1998 ; joss et al . 1978 and soong et al .",
    "1990a ) and the well known ability of a tilted , twisted , counter - precessing accretion disk to phenomenologically account for much of the complex 35-day optical and x - ray behavior displayed by the her x-1/hz her system ( petterson 1975 ; petterson 1977 ; gerend & boynton 1976 ; crosa & boynton 1980 ; boynton , crosa & deeter 1980 ; middleditch 1983 ) .",
    "we stress that most of the observed 35-day behavior has been associated with the _ outer _",
    "portion of the accretion disk whereas we will demonstrate that the pulse evolution must be an _ inner _ disk phenomenon .",
    "previous attempts to model the pulse shape evolution have relied on a combination of neutron star free precession and obscuration by the accretion disk ( trmper et .",
    "al . 1986 ; kahabka 1987 , 1989 ) , obscuration by `` flaps '' of matter at the juncture of the accretion disk and pulsar magnetosphere ( petterson et al . 1991 ) and obscuration of the pulsar by a tilted precessing disk ( bai 1981 ; averitsev et al . 1992 ) .",
    "none of these previous models attempted to explain more than a few aspects of the pulse evolution .",

    "her x-1 exhibits a rich variety of phenomena that appear to be well explained by an accretion disk that is tilted , counter - precessing and twisted .",
    "we review some of the observational arguments for such a disk ( see priedhorsky & holt 1987 for an earlier review ) and include some relevant new observations and interpretation .",
    "the occurrence of two distinct x - ray high states within the 35-day cycle has long been known .",
    "the main high state was found soon after the discovery of her x-1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the dimmer short high state was first recognized in copernicus observations ( fabian et al .",
    "1973 ) and later in _ ariel 5 _ and _ uhuru _ observations ( cooke & page 1975 ; jones & forman 1976 ) .",
    "few extensive observations of the short high state were made until 1989 with _",
    "( deeter et al .",
    "1998 ) . in figure 1",
    "we show the 1 - 37 kev lightcurve obtained with _ ginga _ in 1989 and for the august 1991 main high state .",
    "the august 1991 observation caught a turn - on to the main high state which is confirmed by simultaneous monitoring at lower sensitivity with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) .",
    "the regularity of occurrence of the short high state ten days after the end of the main high state is now clearly demonstrated by the ongoing monitoring of her x-1 with the rxte all sky monitor ( asm ) ( see figure 1 ; scott & leahy 1999 ; and shakura et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the companion star hz her is strongly heated by x - rays emanating from the neutron star and shows little variation in total magnitude , averaged over an orbital cycle , throughout the 35-day cycle ( gerend & boynton 1976 , deeter et al .",
    "optical pulsations produced by reprocessing of the primary x - ray flux have been observed during both the high and low states ( middleditch & nelson 1976 , middleditch 1983 ) .",
    "these observations show that total x - ray production at the neutron star is relatively constant , eliminating gross periodic changes in accretion rate as the cause of the high - low cycle .",
    "the strongest evidence for a tilted , counter - precessing disk in her x-1 comes from the complex set of systematic changes in the optical orbital photometric light curve over the 35-day cycle that can be explained by a combination of disk emission and disk shadowing / occultation of the heated face of hz her ( gerend & boynton 1976 ) .",
    "the occurrence of two distinct x - ray high states within the 35-day cycle has been attributed to obscuration of the central x - ray source by a tilted , twisted , counter - precessing accretion disk ( petterson 1975 ; petterson 1977 ) .",
    "such a disk geometry can be idealized as a set of tilted , concentric rings in which the azimuth of the line - of - nodes of each successively smaller ring shifts smoothly as one moves radially inwards ( petterson 1977 )",
    ". the presence of _ two _ high states per 35-day cycle is naturally explained when the observer s line - of - sight lies close to the binary plane . the appearance of pulsations with significant cold matter absorption at the onset of either high state ( hereafter turn - on ) , is interpreted as the emergence of the pulsar from behind the tilted , outer rim of the accretion disk . the flux decline observed at the end of each high state shows little to no absorption effects and begins as the line - of - sight to the pulsar is approached by the hot , tilted _ inner _ edge of the precessing accretion disk .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in figure 2 and compared to a succession of high states observed with _ ginga _ in 1989 and with an averaged 35-day lightcurve observed with the asm on rxte .",
    "the direction of disk precession is apparently retrograde or `` counter - precessing '' .",
    "the evidence for this comes from x - ray and optical observations and theoretical considerations .",
    "x - ray absorption dips are observed in the main high state just before eclipse that march toward earlier orbital phase as the high state progresses and at a frequency near but slightly lower than the sum of the orbital and 35-day frequencies ( crosa & boynton 1980 , scott & leahy 1999 ) .",
    "the optical lightcurve of hz her exihibits a systematic pattern of changes and a harmonic decomposition revealed that nearly all power is confined to a discrete set of frequencies composed of sums of the orbital and 35-day frequencies ( deeter et al .",
    "a uniformly counter - precessing disk will repeat the same disk - star orientation at the sum of the orbital and 35-day frequencies as will any phenomena dependent on the orientation .",
    "prograde precession should cause phenomena to repeat at the difference of the orbital and 35-day frequencies but no such phenomena are observed .",
    "theoretically , a tilted disk should also precess in a retrograde fashion ( katz 1973 ) .",
    "x - ray pulsations appear during the flux rise at the start of the high states ( i.e. the turn - on ) accompanied by cold matter absorption in the x - ray spectrum ( e.g. parmar , sanford & fabian 1980 ) .",
    "the only short high state turn - on that has been well observed to date is the may 1989 short high state which is compared in figure 3 to the august 1991 main high state turn - on .",
    "the turn - on s are nearly identical in form and both show an increase in softness ratio characteristic of cold matter absorption . the turn - on s",
    "are modeled in figure 3 by an x - ray point source emerging through an atmosphere with a gaussian density profile lying above the plane of a tilted , precessing disk .",
    "the disk angular velocity is @xmath0 @xmath1 , the scale height is @xmath2 the disk radius and the disk is tilted at @xmath3 with respect to the orbital plane of her x-1 .",
    "the optical depth at the base of the disk atmosphere is 30 .",
    "the disk model is described in more detail in section 7 .",
    "the two turn - on s last about 3 hours in contrast to the eclipse egress which lasts only a few minutes ( e.g. leahy 1995b ) .",
    "the pulse profile exhibits no significant changes during the turn - on but merely increases in flux in different energy bands ( deeter et al .",
    "the x - ray observations coupled with the optical observations imply that the primary cause of the high - low flux cycle is obscuration .    the flux after the beginning of the main high state often shows a gradual increase by 20 - 50% over the next 1 - 4 days .",
    "the pulse profile is relatively constant in shape during this period .",
    "we propose that the x - ray flux rise is the result of viewing the neutron star through a hot dense lower corona lying just above the outer accretion disk surface . as the elevation of the observer s line - of - sight increases with respect to the nominal outer disk plane the amount of obscuration will decrease .",
    "this effect should also be present in the short high state and in the system lmc x-4 where a tilted precessing disk is also postulated to occur ( lang et al .",
    "the existence of another much larger and lower density scattering corona is indicated by the existence of low state flux at 5% of the peak main high state flux ( e.g. choi et al . 1997 ; mihara et al .",
    "a two layer disk corona has been discussed theoretically by schandl & meyer ( 1994 ) .",
    "the lower corona has a temperature of @xmath4 k while the upper corona has a temperature of @xmath5 k. the observed @xmath6 flux increase implies a column density of @xmath7 @xmath8 at the base of the lower corona for pure thompson scattering . from figure 2 , the duration of the flux increase implies a vertical angular thickness to the lower corona of @xmath9 with respect to the nominal outer disk plane .",
    "if pure obscuration by a precessing , tilted , thin , and _",
    "planar _ disk were the cause of the high - low flux cycle then one might expect to observe : 1 ) rapid flux cutoffs at the ends of the high states equivalent to the high state turn - on s 2 ) identical pulse profiles during the main and short high states and 3 ) nearly identical fluxes during the main and short high states except for variations caused by geometric differences in coronal obscuration .",
    "in contrast , both types of high state show gradual flux declines that last several days and without significant absorption effects .",
    "a tilted and _ twisted _ disk can explain the gradual flux decline if the disk is twisted in the direction of precession such that the azimuthal angle between the outer and inner disk line of nodes is @xmath10",
    ". in a tilted and twisted disk the line - of - nodes and tilt of individual contiguous disk rings varies smoothly as one moves from the outer to inner disk radii .",
    "the hot , inner region of the disk gradually covers the x - ray emitting region during a transition to a low state .",
    "we illustrate this type of disk model in figure 2 and compare it to the lightcurve observed with _",
    "ginga _ and an average lightcurve from the rxte / asm .",
    "a tilt of @xmath11 for the outermost ring is determined from the assumption of an observer elevation of @xmath12 and the observed 35-day phase separation of @xmath13 for the main and short high state turn - on s . ]",
    "the required outer disk tilt is independent of the outer disk thickness .",
    "we note that the geometry of the disk model proposed in schandl & meyer ( 1994 ) is inconsistent with the observations since it predicts cold matter absorption at the start of the main high state with a gradual flux decline caused by a covering up of the neutron star by an inner disk corona and the same events , but in _ opposite _ sequence , during the short high state ( e.g. see their figure 12 ) .",
    "however , the same sequence of events is observed in both the main and short high states .",
    "the overall spectral changes during the main high state were further explored by comparing the 20 - 50 kev pulsed flux average main high state lightcurve observed with batse with a 2 - 12 kev flux average main high state observed with rxte / asm . following the procedure described in scott & leahy ( 1999 ) , the batse pulsed flux light curve over the timespan mjd 49933 to mjd 50507 , obtained from folded - on - board data ( see bildsten et al .",
    "1997 ) , was sorted into orbital phase `` 0.2 '' turn - on main high states or `` 0.7 '' orbital phase turn - on s and averaged .",
    "seven main high states were used to construct the average 0.2 turn - on main high state lightcurve and eight for the average 0.7 turn - on main high state .",
    "likewise , for the 2 - 12 kev rxte / asm a similar sorting and folding was done to construct average light curves for the timespan mjd 50146 to mjd 50947 with 12 and 10 main high states averaged to form , respectively , the average 0.2 turn - on and 0.7 turn - on main high state lightcurves . during the flux decline at the end of the main high state , the 20 - 50 kev pulsed flux dropped to the level of the background flux more than one day preceding a similar drop in the 2 - 12 kev flux in both turn - on type main high states . in figure 4",
    "we compare the softness ratio formed by the two lightcurves .",
    "the turn - on at 35-day phase 0.0 shows a rapid increase in softness ratio consistent with decreasing absorption .",
    "the pre - eclipse dips also show up as decreased softness consistent with absorption .",
    "however , the softness ratio shows a large _ increase _ during the flux decline near the end of the main high state followed by a large decline .",
    "the softness ratio increase is incompatible with either absorption or an energy independent thomson scattering of an unresolved point source by a corona or disk atmosphere ( as in the schandl & meyer 1994 model ) as the sole cause of the flux decline .",
    "therefore the flux decline at the end of the main high state can not be the result of an occultation of a _ point _ source by either a cold or a hot disk edge .",
    "the peak short high state x - ray flux is only 30% that of the peak main high state flux and exhibits a quite different pulse profile .",
    "dramatic changes in the pulse profile are observed during the last few days of the main high state and throughout the short high state ( see deeter et al .",
    "1998 and next section ) .",
    "if an obscuring region causes the gradual flux decline and the density scale height was much larger than the linear size of the pulse emitting region then minimal pulse shape changes would be observed as well as little difference in pulse profile between the main and short high states .",
    "two possible explanations for the high state flux declines , pulse shape evolution and the low short high state flux are 1 ) systematic changes in the x - ray beaming direction are occurring in addition to those caused by neutron star rotation and/or 2 ) the scale height of a precessing obscuring inner disk region is indeed comparable in size to the pulse emitting region .",
    "if explanation 1 ) is correct then we are observing a combination of an obscuration of a point source causing the flux declines and beaming changes that cause both pulse shape changes and the main and short high state flux difference .",
    "this possibility has been advocated by trmper et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and kahabka ( 1989 ) using beam changes caused by free precession of the neutron star coupled with obscuration by a precessing disk . in 2 ) the flux declines , the main and short high state flux and pulse shape differences and the pulse shape changes are caused purely by progressive disk occultation of an extended source .",
    "we will discuss both these explanations in more detail after reviewing the phenomenology of the pulse evolution and phase alignment of the main and short high state pulses .",
    "we now review the salient features of the pulse profiles and their evolution presented in figures 5 and 6 and documented in scott ( 1993 ) and deeter et al .",
    "the early 1 - 37 kev main high state pulse profile consists of a large main pulse and a smaller interpulse superposed on an underlying weakly pulsed component ( see figure 5 for profiles and nomenclature of specific pulse features ) .",
    "the main pulse consists of two unequal shoulders ( or peaks ) at energies below 5 kev , but at higher energies a third central peak appears that grows with energy and dominates the main pulse profile above @xmath14 kev .",
    "these energy dependent features of the pulse are well known ( see e.g. soong et al .",
    "we display a subset of the _ ginga _ observations in figure 6 showing the evolution of the pulse profile during the main and short high states displayed in figure 1 . from _ ginga _ and other observations , we propose that the main high state pulse profile evolution consists of three basic events listed in order of decreasing duration : 1 ) a deepening and widening of a `` gap '' in the underlying component near the pulse phase of the _ preinterpulse minima _ that begins early in the main high state and continues until the end ( i.e. pulse phase @xmath15 in figure 6 , top panels ) .",
    "this phenomenon can also be observed in _",
    "uhuru _ and _ heao 1 _ pulse profiles ( joss et al .",
    "1978 ; soong et al .",
    "1990a ) and in recent rxte observations ( scott et al .",
    "the well known quasi - sinusoidal pulse profile that `` appears '' near the end of main high state may simply be the uncovering of this already present gap due to the disappearance of the overlying main pulse .",
    "the quasi - sinusoidal profile is the last pulsed feature to disappear before the high states end .",
    "2 ) the disappearance of the _ leading _ and then the _ trailing shoulder _ of the main pulse over a roughly two day period that starts six to seven days after the main high state turn - on . the main pulse shows relatively little change before this point .",
    "the disappearance of the leading shoulder of the main pulse near the end of the main high state has been noted many times previously ( e.g. soong et al . 1990a ; joss et al . 1978 ; kahabka 1989 ; sheffer et al . 1992 ; scott 1993 ; scott et al . 1997a ; deeter et al . 1998 ) .",
    "3 ) a rapid decay and disappearance of the spectrally _ hard central peak _ of the main pulse was observed with _",
    "ginga _ over an @xmath16 hour period that took place within the time span of the shoulder decay .",
    "a similar rapid decay of the main pulse was observed by _",
    "heao 1 _ but at lower resolution ( soong et al .",
    "1990a ) . in the context of the occultation model described below",
    ", this pulse shape evolution pattern suggests the presence , respectively , of three pulse emitting regions of decreasing size each roughly centered on the pulsar .",
    "two short high states have been observed in enough detail to follow the pulse evolution .",
    "these are the _ ginga _ observations shown in figure 1 and recent rxte observations ( see scott et al .",
    "however with these two short high state observations , combined with the fragmentary observations of other short high states , we can describe the following evolution pattern . as the short high state commences",
    ", the pulse profile is quite different in shape and lower in flux by @xmath17 relative to the main high state pulse . both _",
    "ginga _ and _ exosat _ observations of the short high state profile reveal a _ small hard peak _ and a larger _ soft peak _ separated by @xmath18 in pulse phase and superposed on a _ quasi - sinusoid _",
    "( see figure 6 ) . during _",
    "exosat _ observations ,",
    "the _ small hard peak _ was actually larger than the _ soft peak _ at energies above @xmath19 kev ( kahabka 1987 , 1989 ) .",
    "_ ginga _ observations also showed the _ small hard peak _ increasing in amplitude relative to the _ soft peak _ with increasing energy , but not exceeding that of the _ soft peak_. the rxte observation of the november 1996 short high state did not reveal the presence of the _ small hard peak_. the _ ginga _ observations show the _ small hard peak _ disappearing within one day of the turn - on as did the earlier _ exosat _ observation ( kahabka 1987 ) .",
    "the _ ginga _ and rxte observations showed that the _ soft peak _ also declined in flux , but more slowly , and disappeared three to four days after turn - on .",
    "a narrowing in width occurred in both cases .",
    "the short high state _",
    "soft peak _ contains an even softer component on the trailing side of the peak indicated by a spectral softening at approximately pulse phase @xmath20 ( see fig .",
    "the very soft component is apparent as long as the _ soft peak _ is present .",
    "the _ exosat _",
    "pulse profiles presented by kahabka ( 1987 , 1989 ) also show this very soft component on the trailing side of the _ soft peak_.    the amplitude of the _ quasi - sinusoid _ first increases and then decreases as the may 1989 short high state progresses , and is about @xmath18 out of phase compared with the main high state _ quasi - sinusoid _ ( see section 4 ) .",
    "a similar flux increase of the _ quasi - sinusoid _ can be seen in the short high state profiles displayed in figure 4.3 of kahabka ( 1987 ) .",
    "the overall flux stays relatively constant for about four days following the short high state turn - on , but this is due to a flux _ increase _ in the _ quasi - sinusoid _ just balancing a flux _ decrease _ in the _ small hard peak _ and the _ soft peak_. the overall flux of the _ quasi - sinusoid _ is roughly half that of the main high state _ quasi - sinusoid_. as in the main high state , the gap that defines the _ quasi - sinusoid _ shows a decrease in width and depth at increasing energies .    in summary ,",
    "the main high state pulse evolution involves a decay preferentially on the leading edge of the _ main pulse _ and _ interpulse _ that begins late in the high state .",
    "in addition , the formation and continuous slow evolution of an underlying _ quasi - sinusoidal _ profile may also be occurring .",
    "the short high state involves the narrowing , decay and disappearance at very different rates of the two peaks in the profile superposed on an underlying _ quasi - sinusoid_. evolution of the _ quasi - sinusoid _ is much slower and involves only subtle changes in the profile .",
    "these changes are illustrated in figure 6 .",
    "overall , comparison of the _ ginga _ observations with other observations of the pulse evolution are consistent with a repeating , stable and systematic pattern of change in the pulse profile .",
    "future observations are needed to explore the details and stability of the pulse evolution during the short high state and especially the main high state flux decline .",
    "the overall pulse evolution pattern can only be completely understood if the proper phase alignment of the main and short high state pulse profiles is known . to properly align the main and short high state profiles two methods",
    "might be tried : 1 ) extrapolating the pulse timing ephemeris between high states across the low state where pulsations are unobservable or 2 ) matching pulse features that are common to each profile .",
    "figure 5 displays a main high state pulse profile , a closeup of the _ interpulse _ of the same main high state profile , and a short high state profile .",
    "both profiles are taken from an early point in their respective high states when the effects of the pulse profile evolution are minimal .",
    "the two high state profiles were phase aligned using the pulse timing extrapolation given in deeter et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , in which a pulse phase ephemeris is extrapolated from the april and june 1989 main high states into the june 1989 short high state .    at first glance",
    "the main and short high state pulse profiles seem quite different but there are actually a number of features common to each profile .",
    "the bottom of each panel has a hardness ratio for the profile .",
    "note that the hardness ratio of the main high state profile shows a dip at pulse phase 0.6 and a spectral hardening near pulse phase 1.0 .",
    "the short high state profile also possesses a similar soft dip and spectral hardening separated by 0.4 in pulse phase .",
    "the phase alignment suggested by the spectral features implies that the main high state _",
    "interpulse _ and the short high state peak _",
    "soft peak _ should be matched together .",
    "examination of figure 5 shows that these two features exhibit very similar shapes , fluxes and energy dependence .",
    "the primary differences between the two features may simply be due to the different backgrounds upon which each feature rests , since the underlying _ quasi - sinusoid _ is shifted by 0.5 in phase between the two high states .    the spectral softening at pulse phase 0.6 in either high state profile is apparent in all the high states observed by _ ginga _ with the exception of the anomalous june 1989 main high state .",
    "the spectral softening is also readily apparent in both the main and short high state profiles of the _ exosat _ observations ( see kahabka 1987 , 1989 ) .",
    "energy dependent differencing of the _ ginga _ pulse profiles was used to isolate this soft excess feature .",
    "a pulse profile in a high energy band was scaled until a fit to the surrounding pulse in a lower energy band was obtained and then the difference was taken .",
    "this process revealed that the soft excess feature is very similar in shape , flux and color in all the high states which suggests that it is the _ same _ feature in both the main and short high states ( see scott 1993 ) .",
    "the presence of the same soft excess feature in both the main high state _",
    "interpulse _ and short high state _ soft peak _ strongly supports the phase alignment of figure 5 .",
    "the phase alignment also suggests that the _ hard central peak _ of the main high state pulse profile and the _ small hard peak _ of the short high state profile are corresponding features .",
    "there is a significant flux difference between these two features but both hard peaks increase in width and amplitude at higher energies relative to the surrounding pulse .",
    "the width increase of the _ small hard peak _ is only marginally observable in figure 5 , but is readily apparent in kahabka ( 1989 ) and in rxte / pca observations . in the _ exosat _ observation of the short high state shown by kahabka ( 1989 ) , the _ small hard peak _",
    "is actually larger than the _ soft peak _ at higher energies .",
    "we can now describe the following similarities and differences of features in the main and short high state profiles based upon the phase alignment of figure 5 .",
    "the main high state interpulse and the short high state _ soft peak _ are the _ same _ feature , as is the soft excess feature within each profile .",
    "the short high state _ small hard peak _ is a greatly reduced version of the _ hard central peak _ of the main high state .",
    "the large soft two peaked component underlying the _ hard central peak _ in the main high state is absent in the short high state profile .",
    "the _ quasi - sinusoidal _ profile of the short high state is reduced in flux by about 50% compared to the main high state _ quasi - sinusoid _ and shifted in phase by roughly 0.5 .",
    "the short high state profile can be viewed as a modified version of the main high state profile rather than a completely distinct pulse .",
    "the initial appearance and probable phase alignment of the short high state pulse profile require an explanation of 1 ) the disappearance of the soft shoulders of the main high state main pulse .",
    "2 ) the large drop in flux of the main high state hard central peak 3 ) the nearly equivalent amplitudes of the main high state interpulse and the short high state soft peak .",
    "4 ) the @xmath21 drop in flux and @xmath22 phase difference between the two high state quasi - sinusoidal profiles .",
    "force - free precession of the neutron star with a fixed beam geometry has been proposed as the cause for the pulse shape change between the main and short high states by trmper et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and was later elaborated in kahabka ( 1987 ) , gelman & trmper ( 1988 ) and kahabka ( 1989 ) .",
    "they noted that free precession alone can not explain the overall high - low cycle since the beams needed to model the observed main high state pulse are too wide to disappear from view and cause a low state .",
    "for example , the unpulsed and quasi - sinusoidal components of the profile must be produced by unbeamed emission or very wide beams , so free precession can not cause these pulse components to disappear at the end of a high state .",
    "a model based solely on free precession also has great difficulty explaining the cold matter absorption seen during turn - on in both kinds of high states .",
    "therefore , a periodic obscuration of the x - ray source by the accretion disk is also assumed to explain the disappearance of the pulses and the overall high - low cycle . a composite model with a precessing disk acting as an occulting body and a freely precessing neutron star in which both cause pulse shape changes has been proposed by kahabka ( 1989 ) .",
    "the period and phase of both the precessing disk and the freely precessing neutron star must be closely locked together to prevent longterm drift between the pulse evolution pattern and the high - low intensity cycle ( for example , the leading edge decay of the _ main pulse _ has only been observed at the end of the main high state ) .",
    "the observed random walk in the phase of the main high state poses some difficulties for phase locking since a freely precessing neutron star should be a relatively good clock ( see boynton , crosa & deeter 1980 ; trmper et al .",
    "1986 and baykal et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "a spinning body can exhibit periodic , force - free precession if two of its three principal axes of inertia are unequal ( i.e. a symmetric top with @xmath23 ) .",
    "a review of the basic equations of free precession can be found in bisnovatyi - kogan , mersov & sheffer ( 1990 ) .",
    "free precession can cause major changes in the observed pulse profile that repeat over the course of successive precession cycles . the pulse profile at a given pulse phase changes due to the slow variation in the angle between the magnetic dipole axis and the observer s line - of - sight .",
    "beams emanating from the magnetic polar caps or from any fixed location on the neutron star ( other than the figure axis ) will appear to a distant observer to `` wobble '' in rotational latitude over the precession cycle .",
    "either end of the dipole axis , when facing the observer , will oscillate sinusoidally in latitude during one free precession cycle .",
    "the observed free precession light curve is highly dependent on the angle between the angular momentum axis and the observer s line - of - sight and the emission beam geometry and will be symmetric about the precession phases of the latitude extrema in the dipole motion .",
    "the sensitivity to the beam profile depends mostly on the beam width .",
    "a narrow beam produces pulse components that can appear and disappear from view as the wobbling takes place while components from wider beams will merely show variations in amplitude .",
    "another potentially observable signature of free precession is a characteristic variation in the pulse period over the free precession cycle ( bisnovatyi - kogan , mersov & sheffer 1990 ; bisnovatyi - kogan & kahabka 1993 ) .",
    "measurement of this effect was initially a major motivation for observing her x-1 with _",
    "ginga_. we can estimate the size of the period change expected between the main and short high state using equation 7 of bisnovatyi - kogan & kahabka ( 1993 ) to be @xmath24 s. however the known random walk in pulse frequency ( see bildsten et al .",
    "1997 ; deeter 1981 ) also causes pulse period changes .",
    "the expected period change between the main and short high state is given by : @xmath25 and has a value of @xmath26 s for a noise strength @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29 days .",
    "the expected period changes are thus comparable and would be difficult to separate unless many main - short - main high state pulse period measurements could be made . currently , the most observable potential manifestation of free precession is the pulse evolution observed between and within the high states .",
    "the ability of free precession to account for the change in pulse profile between the main and short high states was tested by kahabka ( 1987 ) using _ exosat _ observations .",
    "the main high state pulse profile was modeled using a gaussian pencil beam for the _ hard central peak _ and a coaxial gaussian fan beam for the _ soft leading _ and _ trailing peaks_. the _ interpulse _ is produced by an identical antipodal fan beam .",
    "the opening angle of the fan beam was determined to be about @xmath30 .",
    "we show a sequence of pulse profiles evolving over the 35-day cycle using the parameters determined by kahabka ( 1987 , 1989 ) in figure 7 .",
    "the pulses occur one day apart over the 35-day cycle and do not include the unpulsed or quasi - sinusoidal component .",
    "the main high state must be centered roughly about day zero with the short high state occurring 18 days later . from the figure several features can be noted : ( 1 ) the _ interpulse _ and the _ soft two peak component _ are always visible .",
    "( 2 ) the _ interpulse _ flux increases ( or decreases ) as the _ main pulse _ flux decreases ( or increases ) . ( 3 ) no leading edge decay of either the _ main pulse _ or _ interpulse _ occurs .",
    "( 4 ) the pulse profile evolves smoothly and slowly over the 35-day cycle , with no rapid profile changes .",
    "( 5 ) the decrease in pulsed intensity is only about 10%-20% between the main and short high state .",
    "all of these features are inconsistent with the evolution actually observed as described in section 3 .",
    "related criticisms of free precession have been made by bisnovatyi - kogan , mersov & sheffer ( 1990 ) . in kahabka ( 1989 ) , a precessing disk was assumed to cause the leading edge decay of the _ main pulse _ during the termination of the main high state with some contribution from free precession .",
    "however , this model has difficulty in explaining the actual short high state profile and the subsequent disappearance of both peaks in the profile as noted in points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above .",
    "a freely precessing neutron star with approximately axisymmetric fan and pencil beams has several general problems in explaining the observed pulse evolution in her x-1 .",
    "( 1 ) the pencil beam can not disappear from view without the fan beam disappearing as well .",
    "the _ small hard peak _ of the short high state appears to be the same pulse component as the _ hard central peak _ of the main high state ( see section 4 ) , but without the surrounding _ soft two peaked component _ that is presumably produced by a fan beam .",
    "( 2 ) the preferential decay of one side of a fan beam can not occur due to free precession .",
    "the two cuts across a fan beam , which result in a two - peaked pulse component , should change in amplitude and width simultaneously as precession occurs .",
    "( 3 ) rapid profile changes , such as those observed near the end of the main high state or the beginning of the short high state , are difficult to explain unless the beam profile has sharp edges . for example , the flux of the _ hard central peak _ dropped by more than 70% in 6.7 hours near the end of the april 1989 main high state . if we assume that the _ hard central peak _ is produced by a pencil beam and that the precessional motion of the pulsar is responsible for its amplitude decrease , then we can estimate the _ latitudinal _ width of the pencil beam .",
    "we conservatively estimate that the _ hard central peak _ flux drops to zero in approximately 12 hours . in this period ,",
    "the beam axis moves approximately through an angle @xmath31 away from the observer s line - of - sight . with @xmath32 ,",
    "this produces a latitudinal width over this portion of the beam of about @xmath33 .",
    "we can also estimate the _ longitudinal _ width of this portion of the beam to be @xmath34 from the observed pulse shape as the beam sweeps _ across _ our line - of - sight .",
    "the beam responsible for the _ hard central peak _ would have to be @xmath35 times broader in longitude than in latitude , a quite improbable situation .",
    "to explain a rapid change in the pulse profile observed with _",
    "heao 1 _ near the end of a main high state ( soong et al .",
    "1987 ) with a free precession model , shakura , postnov & prokhorov ( 1998 ) have invoked a temporary transition from a symmetric top to a triaxial neutron star caused by a `` quake '' during the main high state flux decline .",
    "the quake induces a rapid shift in the rotational latitude of the magnetic axis and thus induces rapid changes in the observed pulse profile .",
    "this explanation may work for one case of observed rapid pulse profile change but the rapid decline of the pulse during the main high state now appears to be a normal and repeating phenomenon rather than an anomalous event ( see deeter et al .",
    "it seems rather improbable that neutron star quakes could be arranged to regularly occur during the 35-day phase of the main high state flux decline but not to occur at other times .",
    "in addition , there appears to be no evidence for an expected phase shift caused by the quake based on _ ginga _ and rxte observations . in conclusion",
    ", we find little evidence supporting neutron star free precession as the cause of the pulse shape changes in her x-1 .",
    "if the neutron star is not undergoing free precession then the precessional motion of the inner disk becomes the primary candidate causing pulse evolution .",
    "pulse shape changes might be caused by modulation of matter flow onto the magnetic field lines by a changing aspect between the magnetosphere and a tilted , precessing accretion disk .",
    "the cycle of high and low states can be attributed to obscuration by the precessing accretion disk while the pulse shape evolution results from variations in the accretion column structure induced by the changing pattern of matter entry onto the magnetic field lines . as a naive example of a possible variation ,",
    "assume the accreting matter attaches directly to a dipole magnetic field at a radius @xmath36 and then travels along the field lines onto the magnetic poles .",
    "the angular extent of the accretion cap will be given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the radius of the neutron star ( lamb , pethick & pines 1973 ) .",
    "an increase in @xmath36 will cause a decrease in the accretion column radius at the neutron star surface and concentrate the energy released by the accretion into a smaller area . a decrease in @xmath36 will have the opposite effect .",
    "a full evaluation of the coupling between a tilted , precessing accretion disk , the neutron star magnetosphere and the net effect on the pulsar beam involves complex physics that has not been undertaken as yet and is beyond the scope of this discussion .",
    "it seems plausible that some degree of systematic pulse evolution should be caused by a changing disk orientation , but we argue that this is unlikely to be the _ primary _ cause of the pulse shape changes observed in her x-1 .",
    "nonlinear changes in the flow rate and pattern could be responsible for rapid changes observed in the pulse profile , but these rapid changes must be scheduled to occur just as the overall flux declines at the end of the main high state and not at other times .",
    "this mechanism should also cause both _",
    "increases _ and _ decreases _ in the pulse profile . in the visible high states only decreases in pulse features are ever observed .",
    "the most complicated pulses are apparent at the beginning of the high states with a subsequent disappearance of features as the high state progresses .",
    "nature would have to conspire so that increases in the amplitude of pulse profile components occur only during the low state .",
    "petterson et al . ( 1991 ) have qualitatively presented a time dependent disk obscuration model for the pulse evolution that relies on obscuration provided by `` flaps '' of matter at the points where a tilted accretion disk meets the neutron star s magnetosphere .",
    "these `` flaps '' rotate at the pulse period and move in pulse phase as the tilted disk precesses .",
    "it is not clear whether the physics of disk - magnetosphere coupling will produce obscuring flaps of this type , but in any case the model has some qualitative problems when confronted by the observed pulse profiles . during the short high state , the interpulse flux for the `` flaps '' model is larger than during the main high state ( compare figs .",
    "2b and 3b of petterson et al . 1991 ) .",
    "the _ ginga _",
    "observations show that the soft peak flux is _ the same or smaller _ during the short high state than that of the main high state interpulse with which it is identified ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "similar behavior in the _ exosat _ observations can also be seen in fig .  1 of petterson et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . during the short high state",
    "the `` flaps '' model predicts that the main pulse flux should decrease due to increasing `` flap '' obscuration , while the interpulse flux should increase , contrary to the _ ginga _ observations . in the main high state , the main pulse flux and",
    "the interpulse flux should also change in an opposing manner according to the `` flaps '' model , but both fluxes are observed to decrease .",
    "the apparent stability and repeating nature of the pulse evolution may be the result of a resolved occultation of the pulse emission region by the inner edge of a tilted , precessing accretion disk .",
    "two different occultation sequences , and hence two different sets of pulse shape changes will occur , as the observer sees the inner disk edge sweeping alternately ` upwards ' and ` downwards ' across the pulse emitting region and these events will be @xmath39 apart in disk precession phase .",
    "the pulse shape changes observed during both high state types require the `` scale height '' of the disk ( or more generally the `` occulter '' ) to be roughly the size of the dominant pulse emitting region i.e. a few neutron star radii , which will then naturally produce pulse shape changes associated with decreases in x - ray flux . to pursue the occultation idea further",
    "a simple geometric model is developed and qualitatively compared to the observations .",
    "the model proposed below is a considerably refined version of the model originally proposed by bai ( 1981 ) .",
    "a disk occultation model requires at least two components .",
    "a model for the tilted and precessing disk itself is necessary , and a model for the pulsar emission geometry . in the simplest approximation ,",
    "the pulsar beams do not depend on the azimuth of the disk and the disk simply occults the pulse emitting region .",
    "this is probably not entirely true since the disk is coupled to the neutron star through the magnetosphere and the azimuthal progression of a tilted disk may cause some changes in the accretion column and hence the pulse shape .",
    "however , these complexities will be ignored for now and the beams from the pulsar are assumed to be decoupled from the disk . with the choice of a physical location for the beam emission region with respect to the neutron star ,",
    "the apparent spatial location of each beam component as seen by the observer can be computed .",
    "likewise , the occulting disk may have also have a complex geometry due to interaction with the magnetosphere , among other effects , but we will assume a simple planar disk shape .",
    "the sequence of pulse shape changes can be modeled by sweeping the disk over the pulse emission region and comparing the predicted pulse shape changes with the observations .",
    "the least obscured pulse should occur early in the main high state after the pulsar emerges from behind the outer disk rim .",
    "the main and interpulse profiles are clearly asymmetric about their maxima at this time but we will provisionally make several assumptions to simplify the modeling process .",
    "we will first assume that the beam is axisymmetric , the magnetic field is purely dipole and that identical beam emission regions exist at the ends of an axis that is close to but not necessarily identical with the magnetic dipole axis .",
    "we attribute the _ hard central peak _ of the main pulse to a pencil beam directed along the beam axis and the softer flanking shoulders to a surrounding fan beam ( similar to kahabka 1987 ) .",
    "the interpulse is produced as the edge of the fan beam emanating from the antipodal magnetic pole grazes the observer s line - of - sight .",
    "we assume gaussian intensity profiles for the beams since kahabka ( 1987 ) has shown that the pulse profile of her x-1 can be well fit with a small number of gaussian components and this is confirmed by fitting the ginga profiles .",
    "a simple gaussian beam model for both the fan and pencil beams is used and is given by : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the angle from the beam axis , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the pencil and fan beam amplitudes and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the beam widths .",
    "the fan beam opening angle is given by @xmath46 .",
    "three constant flux components are present , two due to magnetospheric emission ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) and one due to low state coronal emission @xmath49 .",
    "values for the beam components are given in table 1 .",
    "the soft two shoulder component in the main high state main pulse results from a cut of the line - of - sight across the two edges of the fan beam `` cone '' , while the interpulse results from a grazing cut along the edge of the `` cone '' .",
    "the large difference in the amplitudes of the main pulse and the interpulse require the line - of - sight to be @xmath50 from the neutron star s rotational equator . since previous optical and x - ray observations show that the observer is offset by @xmath51 relative to the binary plane ( gerend & boynton 1976 ; middleditch 1983 ; deeter et al .",
    "1991 ) the neutron star rotation axis must be inclined by @xmath52 to the orbital axis .    to model",
    "the physical location of the primary pulsar beams requires some additional assumptions .",
    "theoretically , beam models have been divided into slab and column geometries depending on the physical mechanism assumed to decelerate the infalling plasma .",
    "column models assume that either a radiation pressure shock or a collisionless shock lies above the neutron star surface and decelerates the flow .",
    "brainerd & mszros ( 1991 ) have shown that the radiation pressure for the luminosity of the her x-1 is too weak to significantly decelerate the infalling plasma .",
    "it thus seems prudent to assume a slab geometry for the magnetic polar cap of her x-1 . in the slab model the infalling plasma",
    "is decelerated at the neutron star surface and the emitting region is a thin cap only a few meters in height ( mszros & nagel 1985 ) . in more complex models ,",
    "x - ray radiation emitted from the foot of the accretion column is backscattered as it rises through the accretion column ( e.g. brainerd & mszros 1991 ) .",
    "thus the beam consists of direct emission from the polar cap and a backscattered component .",
    "we will first consider a simple pulsar model in which a single emitting point lying on the neutron star surface is chosen to approximate the _ beam _ emission region . the _ pulse _ emission region will have a width of @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the neutron star radius .",
    "an observer will see the emitting point sweep out an ellipse as the neutron star rotates with the surface blocking the emitting point for a portion of the rotation period .",
    "we will refer to this beam geometry as a `` direct fan beam '' geometry .",
    "the beam pattern originating from the emitting point consists of a pencil beam surrounded by a concentric fan beam as in equation 2 ( see figure 8 , top panels ) .",
    "this was the same beam pattern and emission geometry used in the free precession model in section 5 .",
    "we will also consider a second beam / emission model in which the fan beam emission is produced by backscattered radiation from the accretion column that is focused around the neutron star and beamed in the antipodal direction , a `` reversed fan beam '' geometry .",
    "this beaming configuration will produce a similar pulse profile but the spatial locations of the pulse components will be significantly altered ( see figure 8 , bottom panels ) .",
    "the fan beam components will now be observed to originate at some distance above the neutron star surface and @xmath55 .",
    "the _ interpulse _ will now be emitted by the same magnetic pole that produces the _ hard central peak _ while the _ soft shoulders _ of the main pulse come from the opposite pole .",
    "a similar fan and pencil beam configuration has been discussed theoretically by brainerd & mszros ( 1991 ) . in their model , a fan beam is produced from magnetic polar cap radiation that is preferentially backscattered by the incoming accretion flow and then gravitationally focused around the neutron star .",
    "the accretion column is calculated to be optically thin to thomson scattering while the fan beam photons are produced by cyclotron resonance scattering .",
    "only photons at energies less than or equal to the surface cyclotron frequency will be scattered in the accretion column .",
    "support for this pulse profile interpretation is provided by the observed cyclotron absorption feature in her x-1 , which reaches a maximum absorption depth at the pulse phase of the hard central peak and by the disappearance of the main pulse shoulders above the @xmath56 kev cyclotron line energy ( soong et al .",
    "( 1990b ) ) .",
    "the location of the reversed fan beam emission was modeled by assuming the emission occurred from a point at a height of @xmath57 .",
    "this is the cyclotron scattering height of 10 kev photons for a surface field strength corresponding to a cyclotron line energy of 40 kev , a simple dipole field and a neutron mass of @xmath58 .",
    "softer photons will scatter from higher up and harder photons from lower down so the apparent emission region location is energy dependent . the pulses displayed in figure 8 approximately model the main high state pulse profile observed in the _ ginga _ @xmath59 kev band .",
    "gravitational lightbending of the photon trajectories causes the photons to appear to be emitted from a region higher above the neutron star surface than for the case when no lightbending is present .",
    "we illustrate this effect in figure 9 where trajectories are calculated using the equations taken from brainerd & mszros ( 1991 ) and riffert & mszros ( 1989 ) .",
    "a reversed fan beam with an opening angle of @xmath60 with respect to the accretion column and a profile with a half width of @xmath61 was used to calculate the nonattenuated fan beam intensity since this was a good approximation to the beam pattern shown in figure 9 .",
    "the location of the fan beam emitting point was calculated using a sinusoidal approximation to the photon impact parameter for the case of lightbending in figure 9 .",
    "the disk is modeled as an infinite plane with a circular hole centered on the neutron star .",
    "the circular hole has a radius @xmath62 and a gaussian density profile in the direction perpendicular to the disk plane characteristic of an @xmath63disk of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) .",
    "the vertical disk density profile is described by : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the vertical distance above the inner disk midplane , and requires the specification of the free parameters @xmath66 , the midplane density of the disk and @xmath67 , the disk `` scale height '' . to model the occultation ,",
    "the disk is assumed to be simply a linear edge with a minimum distance @xmath68 from the neutron star as seen by the observer .",
    "the disk selectively obscures the pulse emitting region .",
    "when the observer s line of sight lies at an angle @xmath69 above the disk midplane the disk edge will appear to be at a distance @xmath70 from the neutron star .",
    "the optical depth of the disk material will be caused by thomson scattering due to the complete ionization of hydrogen and helium in the inner disk region .",
    "the optical depth will therefore follow the density distribution and is assumed to scale as : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the optical depth scale height , and @xmath73 is the optical depth at @xmath65=0.0 .",
    "the total attenuation caused by the disk for any emitting point depends only on its height above ( or below ) the disk midplane and the angle @xmath69 .",
    "the observer s line - of - sight to the emitting point will pass through a range of heights above the disk plane , so the total optical depth must be found by integrating along this path .",
    "the total optical depth is calculated using : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the height above the disk midplane where the ray connecting the observer and the emitting point intersects the inner disk edge . the extinction to the emitting point is then given by : @xmath76 the effect of the twisted disk is taken into account by having the optical depth increase to infinity as @xmath75 becomes increasingly negative ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the geometric orientation of the neutron star and the inner disk are determined by tilt and azimuth angles .",
    "the tilt is specified with respect to an axis that will be identified as ( but is not required to be ) the stellar binary axis .",
    "reasonable values for the disk tilt lie in the range of @xmath77 in order to fit the overall high state light curve with a tilted , twisted , counter - precessing disk ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "if one assumes the disk edge is cutting across the face of the neutron star at 35-day phases 0.23 and 0.58 ( from observing the pulse evolution ) then a tilt of @xmath78 can be derived .",
    "can this simple model reproduce , qualitatively , the features observed in the main high state pulse evolution ?",
    "figure 8 ( top panel ) shows the approximate spatial locations of the pencil beam and fan beam emission regions for the direct fan beam model .",
    "the neutron star rotation is prograde in figure 8 so a counter - precessing inner disk edge will sweep across the neutron star face from right - to - left in the figure .",
    "we define case 1 disk orientation as illustrated in the top panel of figure 8 , that is , the disk covers the neutron star from top - to - bottom as well as right - to - left .",
    "case 2 disk orientation is defined as the case that the disk covers the neutron star face from right - to - left , bottom - to - top , as illustrated in the lower panel of figure 8 .",
    "a straightforward consideration of the twisted disk geometry shows that during a full 35-day precession period , case 1 and case 2 both occur , separated by one - half a precession period .    the relatively long period during the main high state when the pulse profile shows only small changes",
    ", simply means that the line - of - sight to the pulsar is far from the obscuring inner disk edge .",
    "as the disk edge approaches the pulsar , it is clear from figure 8 ( top panel ) , that in both case 1 and case 2 , the _ trailing _ shoulder ( bb ) of the main pulse will disappear before the pencil beam ( c ) or the leading shoulder ( ba ) . in case 2 , the _ interpulse _ ( a ) will disappear before the pencil beam ( c ) and in case 1 they disappear at nearly the same time .",
    "neither case reproduces the pulse evolution behavior observed in either high state .",
    "reorienting the neutron star spin axis about the line - of - sight will alter the occultation sequences .",
    "if the upper spin pole in figure 8 is tipped toward the right ( toward the oncoming disk edge ) then case 1 will produce a pulse profile sequence in which the order of disappearance will be 1 ) the leading and trailing soft shoulders ( ba and bb ) , 2 ) the hard central peak ( c ) , 3 ) the interpulse ( a ) .",
    "case 1 does not resemble the observed main high state pulse evolution sequence .",
    "but it can can reproduce the short high state sequence if the emergence from the turn - on only reveals the occultation _",
    "after _ the disappearance of the two soft shoulders . if case 1 gives the short high state sequence then case 2 must give the main high state sequence .",
    "however , in case 2 the trailing shoulder ( bb ) disappears first , then the hard central peak ( c ) will disappear , both before the leading shoulder ( ba ) , contrary to the observations .",
    "one can consider all the different possible combinations of neutron star spin and motions of the disk edge .",
    "this has been done and the results ( of whether a satisfactory occultation sequence is obtained ) are summarized in table 2 .",
    "only two of the eight possibilities result in occultation sequences in the correct order for both the main and short high states .",
    "one requires a reverse neutron star spin in one case and a prograde disk precession in the other case . is a retrograde rotation of the neutron star or a prograde precession of the disk possible ?",
    "the long term spinup trend observed in her x-1 ( nagase 1989 ) and the frequency behavior of optical pulsations from the lobes of the companion star hz her ( middleditch & nelson 1976 ) both strongly argue for a prograde pulsar spin .",
    "likewise , the preeclipse dip recurrence period and the predominance of integer combinations of the _ sum _ of the orbital and 35-day frequency in the power density spectrum of the optical light curve strongly indicate a _",
    "counter_-precession for the accretion disk ( deeter et al .",
    "1976 ; crosa and boynton 1980 ) .",
    "thus we discard the direct fan beam model , since it can not give the correct occultation sequence and keep prograde spin and retrograde precession .",
    "we also note that those occultation sequences from the direct fan beam model , even though in the correct order , have a difficulty . for the short high state",
    "the observed sequence starts with a weak hard pulse ( c ) but has no evidence whatsoever for any trace of the leading ( ba ) or trailing ( bb ) shoulders .",
    "this is very hard to achieve in the direct fan beam model since the hard pulse ( c ) and soft shoulders ( ba , bb ) are produced in directly adjacent locations .",
    "the above qualitative difficulties in matching the observed sequence of pulse profile changes can be resolved using a `` reversed '' fan beam , as we show next .",
    "both the observed main and short high state pulse evolution can be reproduced qualitatively if the neutron star is tilted as shown in the lower panels of figure 8 .",
    "case 1 ( disk tilted as in the upper panel ) reproduces the main high state decay of the _ leading _ soft shoulder ( ba ) followed by the",
    "_ hard central peak _ ( c ) and the _ trailing _ soft shoulder ( bb ) .",
    "the short high state evolution is produced by the case 2 disk orientation as shown in the lower panel of figure 8 .",
    "the observed evolution requires complete occultation of the soft shoulders ( ba , bb ) of the main pulse before the short high state turn - on .",
    "this can be readily accomplished since the shoulders ( ba , bb ) are from regions well separated from the location of the _ hard central peak _",
    "the shorter length of the short high state and the required initial partial occultation of the pulse emitting region can be produced by the same offset of the observer s line - of - sight from the binary plane . in figure 10a and 10b , a disk occultation and the resulting pulse profile changes",
    "are illustrated using the model disk and beam profiles described earlier .",
    "the parameters used are displayed in table 1 .",
    "the main high state pulse evolution is modeled in figure 10a .",
    "the leading edge decay of both the fan beam and the interpulse occurs as the disk edge sweeps across the neutron star face .",
    "the actual timing of the decay of the soft shoulders and the interpulse put important constraints on the apparent tilt of the neutron star relative to the disk edge , which is also quite sensitive to the actual locations of the emitting regions .",
    "for the model shown in figure 10a , the interpulse decays away a bit early relative to the soft shoulders compared to the observations .",
    "in addition the decay of the trailing soft shoulder is delayed compared to the observations since the model disk edge appears to be too sharp . however , making the disk edge fuzzier will tend to wash out the short high state sequence , assuming a fixed inner disk ring tilt and radius .",
    "this model predicts that the pencil beam ( _ hard central peak _ , c ) , should show a trailing edge decay , but observing this effect requires a known pulse ephemeris during this decay phase .",
    "lastly , as the disk edge cuts across the neutron star face , short term variations in the pulse profile should occur in addition to the longer term systematic changes , due to variations in the disk opacity as material is accreted onto the neutron star .",
    "the short high state pulse evolution is modeled in figure 10b .",
    "the disk motion will cause the pencil beam ( _ small hard peak _ , c ) to decay away first followed by the interpulse ( a ) . the more edge - on view of the inner disk plane at the start of the short high state will lengthen the traversal of the disk edge across the neutron star face relative to the main high state and this is consistent with the slow disappearance of the interpulse ( _ soft peak _ , a ) relative to the same event during the main high state .",
    "in contrast to the main high state , no significant leading edge decay of the pulse components is predicted during the short high state and none is observed .",
    "the short high state must begin with the accretion disk partially obscuring the pulse emission region to account for both the different pulse shape and the lower short high state flux .",
    "the placement of the inner disk edge at the turn - on is probably somewhat variable due to changes in the total disk twist and elevation so this model predicts that the short high state pulse profile should be quite variable as well at the start of the turn - on .",
    "depending on the exact placement of the inner disk edge , the _ small hard peak _ ( c ) may be larger , smaller , or completely attenuated compared to the interpulse in figure 6 .",
    "likewise , the disk edge may be advanced enough that the interpulse is gone as well at the turn - on .",
    "the evolution of the quasi - sinusoidal components is modeled by the occultation of emission regions d and e in figure 10 .",
    "the deepening of the pre - interpulse minima early in the main high state and the persistence of the quasi - sinusoidal pulse after the disappearance of the main pulse suggests an occultation of an emission region much larger in size than the neutron star .",
    "radiation scattered from the inflowing magnetospheric material many neutron star radii above the surface may produce this emission .",
    "if we assume 1 ) the magnetospheric flow is optically thin to thomson scattering as in the brainerd & mszros model and 2 ) that accretion onto a magnetic pole occurs over a range of magnetic azimuth less than @xmath18 , then two equal and constant flux pulse components may be produced by scattering in the accretion flows .",
    "the locus of scattering points illuminated by the hard pencil beam ( c ) over a neutron star rotation period are indicated by d and e in the rightmost panels of figure 8 .",
    "d and e are much further away from the neutron star than the emission components a , ba , bb and c ( middle column of panels in figure 8) : the small circle between d and e indicates the neutron star surface . since the emission from e is due to the magnetospheric flow onto the the opposite pole on the neutron star from the flow producing the emission at d , the instantaneous location of scattered emission on e will be @xmath18 different in pulse phase from the instantaneous location of the emission on d. d and e are still close enough to the neutron star that light travel time delays are negligible . in the absence of any occultation",
    ", the instantaneous scattering from d and e are visible at all pulse phases so the total emission from d and e appears unmodulated .",
    "a third , small , constant - flux contribution should also be present from the much larger accretion disk corona that produces the low state flux .",
    "the main and short high state quasi - sinusoidal pulse evolution and the preinterpulse deepening can together be interpreted as an occultation of the x - ray illuminated , magnetospheric flow ( regions d and e ) .",
    "both the upper and lower magnetospheric flows will sweep out cones as the neutron star rotates , which cross the `` plane of the sky '' at pulse phases 0.25 and 0.75 . for the neutron star orientation show in figure 8 ( lower panels ) , a deepening is predicted in the pulse profile during the main high state near pulse phase 0.25 as the outer portion of the upper magnetospheric flow rotates behind the oncoming disk edge .",
    "the _ widening _ will continue as the occultation progresses but the _ deepening _ will stop since the flux at pulse phase 0.25 will then be produced mostly by the unocculted , antipodal , magnetospheric flow .    near the middle of the main high state , a second deepening is predicted at pulse phase 0.75 as the disk begins to occult the lower magnetospheric flow . at the short high state turn - on",
    ", the lower magnetospheric flow will already be occulted , accounting for the @xmath79 drop in flux observed in the `` quasi - sinusoid '' . the constant flux produced by the upper magnetospheric flow",
    "will now be preferentially occulted near pulse phase 0.75 as the occultation progresses , producing a dip there , and an @xmath39 phase shift between the two high state `` quasi - sinusoids '' .",
    "the dip should widen as the short high state progresses . the initial increase and",
    "then decrease of the overall quasi - sinusoidal flux occurs simply because the line - of - sight is moving away from the outer disk edge and through decreasing accretion disk coronal density as the inner disk occultation progresses .",
    "a comparison of the model in figure 10 with the observations readily shows that while many features of the quasi - sinusoidal evolution can be modeled , there is a problem with component e. at the end of the main high state , the quasi - sinusoid peaks at pulse phase 0.75 , whereas component d is near minima , implying that it is out - of - phase by 0.5 .",
    "the short high state provides no constraint on e since it is completely occulted .",
    "the `` fix '' to the simple model needed to produce the asymmetry in the soft shoulder peaks should also affect the location of pulse component e and may solve this problem . in any case",
    ", using two rotating rings to model the quasi - sinusoids is probably a gross simplification of the actual situation since the interaction geometry of the accretion column with the disk should be quite complex .",
    "in addition , another weakly pulsed component may be present due to scattering or reemission from the inner disk edge",
    ". this may be the cause of the low energy sinusoid that appears to be in phase with the higher energy quasi - sinusoid ( see e.g. mccray et al .",
    "we note that the pulse evolution of the soft energy quasi - sinusoid ( @xmath80 kev ) is at present unknown and that its observation may provide valuable clues about the inner disk .",
    "recent bepposax observations of a short high state flux decline ( oosterbroek et al .",
    "2000 ) discovered an increase in relative absorption that can be explained by assuming seperate scattering and absorption regions .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with a gradual inner disk occultation of an extended scattering region associated with the accretion column .",
    "the radius of the inner disk edge can be estimated from the duration of the main high state occultation event .",
    "let @xmath81 be the inner disk radius and @xmath82 the radius of the pulse emitting region . from the reversed beam model @xmath82 is about @xmath83 for the region emitting the main pulse .",
    "the velocity of the disk edge is given approximately by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the angular velocity of the disk precession ( equal to @xmath86 ) and @xmath87 is the tilt angle of the inner disk .",
    "the inner disk radius can now be estimated from : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the duration of the occultation of the main pulse emitting region . from the april 1989 main high state , @xmath90 days .",
    "the inner disk tilt angle is estimated to be between @xmath77 .",
    "these parameter values produce an estimate of @xmath91 .",
    "this is much smaller than the corotation radius of @xmath92 where the orbital angular velocity equals that of the neutron star , assuming a 12 km neutron star radius and @xmath93 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the reverse fan beam model with prograde neutron star spin and retrograde disk precession naturally accounts for the major features of the observed main and short high state pulse evolution .",
    "it also accounts for a number of other features , as described above , e.g. the @xmath18 phase shift between the two high state `` quasi - sinusoids '' .",
    "the model proposed here for the pulse evolution cycle in her x-1 consists of an occultation of the neutron star by the inner edge of a tilted and precessing disk .",
    "the leading edge decay of the main and interpulses during the main high state preclude a beam geometry consisting of a pencil beam surrounded by a fan beam and emitting from the neutron star surface .",
    "however , reversing the fan beam so that is emitted in the antipodal direction with respect to the pencil beam and at some distance above the stellar surface allows the leading edge decay to be reproduced by an occultation in a natural fashion .",
    "the observed short high state evolution pattern then arises naturally with this geometry .",
    "cyclotron resonant scattering in the accretion column is an attractive mechanism for producing a pencil beam surrounded by an reversed fan beam .",
    "the energy of the cyclotron resonance is directly proportional to the local magnetic field strength and this decreases with altitude above the neutron star surface .",
    "when the energy of an upward traveling photon equals the local cyclotron energy , scattering will occur .",
    "this creates a natural energy dependent filtering process for photons emitted in the accretion cap and divides the beam into three components .",
    "hard photons ( especially those above the surface cyclotron frequency ) will escape in a pencil beam .",
    "softer photons will be backscattered and gravitationally focused around the neutron star in an antipodally directed fan beam .",
    "finally , photons scattered from the accretion column isotropically will produce a constant pulse component .",
    "the softest photons will scatter from the highest altitudes in the accretion column .",
    "the neutron star rotation will cause the highest altitude emission ( d and e in figure 8) to rotate with pulse phase .",
    "the occultation of this high altitude emission by the precessing disk edge creates gaps in the constant emission profile and therefore a `` quasi - sinusoidal '' profile . a hard pencil beam ( c ) , a softer fan beam ( ba and bb ) and a quasi - sinusoidal component ( d and e ) qualitatively match the observed energy dependence in the main high state profile .",
    "this type of beam model may be applicable to other x - ray pulsars as well , for example vela x-1 , which displays a pulse profile consisting of two doubled peaked components at soft x - ray energies , possibly superposed on a quasi - sinusoidal component , that fills in at harder x - rays in a way quite similar to the her x-1 main pulse ( white , swank & holt 1983 ) .",
    "in the case of vela x-1 , the observer s line - of - sight would have to be located much closer to the neutron star spin equator than in her x-1 .",
    "while an occultation model apparently has many attractive features , a roughly @xmath30 tilt is required between the neutron star spin axis and the binary axis of the system .",
    "is this plausible ?",
    "a large tilt to the neutron star may have originated in the supernova explosion that gave it birth .",
    "the accretion of matter from the companion will cause angular momentum to be accreted by the neutron star .",
    "since the direction of the time averaged accreted angular momentum is along the binary axis of the system , the neutron star s spin axis should become coaligned with the binary axis . this event will take some time and the accreted angular momentum will spin up the neutron star .",
    "in fact , the alignment timescale and the spin - up timescale should be comparable .",
    "the measured spin - up time of her x-1 is about @xmath94 years .",
    "this timescale is the same as that predicted for the entire x - ray emitting phase of her x-1 ( savonije 1978 ) .",
    "therefore , if her x-1 is currently tilted that tilt will in all likelyhood be maintained throughout the rest of the x - ray emitting phase .",
    "however the important question is what is the _ current _ ratio of accreted angular momentum to that at the start of the x - ray emitting phase ?",
    "her x-1 may be near the start of the x - ray emitting phase .",
    "the x - ray emitting phase ends when the accretion flow becomes great enough to smother the neutron star and prevent pulsations .",
    "historical optical observations of hz her show that the x - ray heating and hence the mass accretion rate has ceased occasionally for years to decade - long periods over the last hundred years ( jones , forman & liller 1973 ; hudec & wenzel 1986 ) .",
    "the current state of mass transfer depends on the x - ray heating of hz her and is inhibited by the x - radiation pressure .",
    "thus hz her must be close to , but not quite , filling its roche lobe .",
    "this state of affairs is more consistent with her x-1 being at the beginning rather than the end of its x - ray phase .",
    "if so , then a highly tilted neutron star can plausibly exist in the her x-1 system .",
    "another point in favor of such an interpretation is the 1.24 second pulse period of her x-1 .",
    "this period is typical of the radio pulsar population .",
    "a period longer than 3 seconds or much shorter than 1 second would unequivocally show that her x-1 has been spun down or spun up by a significant history of interaction with circumstellar matter .",
    "finally , a tilted neutron star should cause a persistent asymmetry in the optical orbital lightcurve about orbital phase 0.5 .",
    "no such asymmetry was reported by deeter et al .",
    "( 1976 ) but later studies of the orbital optical lightcurve with more data indicate the presence of just such an asymmetry ( e.g. voloshina , lyuti & sheffer 1990 ; thomas et al . 1983 ) .",
    "the properties required of the inner disk to fit the observed pulse evolution are a scale height comparable to the neutron star diameter and a small inner radius ( @xmath95 ) . for comparison , the corotation radius is @xmath96 for her x-1 . the predicted magnetospheric radius , @xmath36 , for disk accretion depends on assumptions on the boundary conditions . using the known parameters for her x-1 ( leahy & scott 1998 ) ,",
    "one obtains @xmath97 cm for the model of kiraly & mszros ( 1988 ) ; @xmath98 cm for the model of lamb ( 1988 ) ; and @xmath99 k cm for the formula of finger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ( which has the special case of @xmath100 for the model of ghosh & lamb , 1978 ) .",
    "the model of aly ( 1980 ) for a highly conducting disk , gives only a slightly smaller value for the disk inner radius : @xmath101 cm ( for @xmath102 near @xmath103 , the dependence on @xmath102 is @xmath104 , so the minimum @xmath36 is @xmath105 of this for @xmath106 ) .",
    "the disk viscosity parameter is @xmath107 , @xmath108 is defined in lamb ( 1988 ) , k is a dimensionless parameter , which finger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) find to be @xmath109 for a0535 + 26 , and @xmath102 is the tilt of the dipole axis from the equatorial plane . in all cases",
    "the predicted disk radius greatly exceeds the inner disk radius required by the occultation model .",
    "another observation relevant to the magnetospheric radius is the spinup rate of her x-  1 .",
    "it is the smallest among the accretion - powered pulsars and indicates the slowest rate of net angular momentum accretion . during the giant outbursts of be - transients , an x - ray flux vs. spin - up rate correlation has been observed in which spin - up occurs at a rate consistent with the fiducial torque ( e.g. finger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; bildsten et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; nelson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; scott et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ) .",
    "the formula for the fiducial accretion torque @xmath110 is given by @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the magnetospheric radius for spin - up , @xmath113 is the mass accretion rate and @xmath114 is the mass of the neutron star .",
    "this formula assumes all the angular momentum of the accreting matter at @xmath112 is given to the neutron star .",
    "the known spin - up rate gives a value for @xmath115 km : clearly too small to be physical .",
    "the small disk radius from the occultation model is much larger than this .",
    "this implies that the actual torque on the neutron star must be smaller than the fiducial torque , to allow a magnetospheric radius as large as @xmath116 . in the ghosh & lamb ( 1978 , 1979 ) model of an aligned rotator",
    ", a residual portion of the magnetic field is not screened by currents near the magnetospheric radius and will interact with material orbiting beyond the corotation radius .",
    "the interaction adds a negative torque component to the total torque .",
    "a smaller net torque will be exerted if the magnetospheric radius approaches the corotation radius of the neutron star .",
    "thus nearly any spin - up rate can be obtained within a small range of magnetospheric radii near to but inside the corotation radius .",
    "so it is not surprising that the predicted magnetospheric radius from the ghosh and lamb model for her x-1 is nearly equal to the corotation radius given above .",
    "however , it is well known that the ghosh and lamb model is not consistent with the spin behaviour of many x - ray pulsars ( e.g. bildsten et al . 1997",
    "; nelson et al .",
    "in summary , different models give a magnetospheric radius from the spin - up rate of her x-1 in a wide range between @xmath54 and @xmath117 .    how does one account for an inner disk edge which is at @xmath116 ?",
    "it is much smaller than the predicted neutron star magnetosphere radius , yet may be much larger than the radius predicted from simple spin - up .",
    "we speculate on what may be the real physical origin of the @xmath116 disk inner edge .",
    "one possibility is that the dipole magnetic field is much smaller than that indicated by the observed x - ray cyclotron line so that the predicted magnetospheric radius is much smaller .",
    "the magnetospheric radius decreases from @xmath118 to @xmath119 if the dipole component of b is a factor of 25 less than deduced from the cyclotron line .",
    "the cyclotron line would be explained as arising in non - dipolar magnetic fields in the accretion region at the neutron star surface .",
    "an emission region concentrated in a non - dipolar surface pocket of the field and producing a pencil beam would likely be difficult to distinguish from a similar emission region in the case of a pure dipole .",
    "another explanation has been put forth by baushev & bisnovatyi - kogan ( 1999 ) in which a magnetic field of @xmath120 g is estimated for her x-1 from the observed cyclotron line energy by assuming a large anisotropy exists in the electron momentum distributions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field lines . whether either of these possibilities is viable will probably require much more research .",
    "an alternative to a reduced dipole field is a stable , thin inner disk which penetrates far into the magnetosphere .",
    "however , this seems very unlikely : the magnetosphere is very stiff due to the steep gradient of magnetic pressure and energy density ( as @xmath121 ) for a dipole field .",
    "models which have the disk penetrate as deeply as possible ( e.g. aly 1980 ) , do not have an inner radius very much less than other models ( tilting the magnetic axis gives a reduction at most by a factor 3 in the inner disk radius ) .",
    "so a disk penetrating far into the magnetosphere appears to be unfeasible .",
    "another possibility is that current models for determining the magnetospheric radius are inadequate .",
    "for example , miller & stone ( 1997 ) use magnetohydrodynamic calculations to show that the balbus - hawley instability and magnetic braking have dramatic effects on the magnetospheric boundary .",
    "they also result in outflowing winds along field lines opened up by reconnection .",
    "it is quite possible that the small inner disk in her x-1 is due to such effects .",
    "we note that mass outflows are quite likely as there is extended x - ray emission from a large corona in her x-1 .",
    "the model described in this paper is phenomenological and highly idealized .",
    "the purpose was to show that an inner disk occultation can explain the observations and has reasonable physical grounds for support .",
    "considerable refinement of the model remains to be done .",
    "the decay of the soft shoulders of the main pulse occurs earlier in the main high state than an axisymmetric beam model predicts .",
    "the soft shoulders of the main high state main pulse are unequal in amplitude .",
    "these problems might indicate an offset in the dipole axis .",
    "an occultation of the neutron star by the inner accretion disk explains the pulse evolution cycle of her x-1 in a natural fashion .",
    "many of the details of the observed evolution can be accounted for by invoking a reversed fan beam geometry around a neutron star significantly inclined to the binary axis of the system .",
    "the leading edge decay of the main pulse and interpulse during the main high state is properly predicted . during the short high state , the rapid disappearance of the small hard peak as well as the slower decay of the soft peak are predicted .",
    "note that the soft peak shows little decay of either the leading or trailing edge and this is also predicted by the occultation model . in summary ,",
    "most of the curious pulse shape changes observed during the main and short high states are tied together with a single simple occultation model .",
    "we note that no previous model for the pulse shape changes , including free precession , has been able to account for the observed details of the pulse evolution .",

    "<S> _ ginga _ and rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) observations have allowed an unprecedented view of the recurrent systematic pulse shape changes associated with the 35-day cycle of hercules x-1 , a phenomenon currently unique among the known accretion - powered pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> we present observations of the pulse shape evolution . </S>",
    "<S> an explanation for the pulse evolution in terms of a freely precessing neutron star is reviewed and shown to have several major difficulties in explaining the observed pulse evolution pattern . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we propose a phenomenological model for the pulse evolution based upon an occultation of the pulse emitting region by the tilted , inner edge of a precessing accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic and repeating pulse shape changes require a _ resolved _ occultation of the pulse emission region . </S>",
    "<S> the observed pulse profile motivates the need for a pulsar beam consisting of a composite coaxial pencil and fan beam but the observed evolution pattern requires the fan beam to be focused around the neutron star and beamed in the antipodal direction . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral hardness of the pencil beam component suggests an origin at the magnetic polar cap , with the relatively softer fan beam emission produced by backscattering from within the accretion column , qualitatively consistent with several theoretical models for x - ray emission from the accretion column of an accreting neutron star . </S>"
