    "in the last years , the fabrication of quasi - one - dimensional quantum rings became possible @xcite .",

    "the number of electrons on the ring can be controlled by the gate electrode .",
    "the experimental studies of the rings with only one or two electrons were reported by lorke _",
    "@xcite the possibility to vary the number of particles from very few to several hundreds enables experimentalists to tune the electron - electron interaction in a wide range .",
    "one of the most striking consequences of the interaction is the formation of a wigner crystal @xcite , a many - body state with electrons localized at discrete lattice sites . yet",
    "it is well known that in an infinite one - dimensional system the fluctuations destroy the long - range order@xcite .",
    "this raised doubts about the existence of a one - dimensional wigner crystal which has become a long - debated subject . only in the nineties glazman _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that the arbitrarily weak pinning potential stabilizes the one - dimensional wigner crystal .",
    "it was proven that the pinning potential suppresses the long - wavelength fluctuation modes which are responsible for destroying the long - range order . due to the pinning potential",
    "the wigner state is always localized in contrast to the electron liquid state @xcite .",
    "thus in the presence of a weak impurity the wigner transition should manifest itself as electron localization .",
    "the critical @xmath2 for a 1d system estimated in the work of glazman _",
    "_ was of the order of unity .",
    "for the two - dimensional electron gas tanatar and ceperley found a critical value @xmath4 , using a monte - carlo technique @xcite .",
    "the reason for this large value is a very small shear modulus of the two - dimensional wigner crystal @xcite . in three dimensions a wigner crystal",
    "is expected at @xmath5 ( ref . ) .",
    "electron localization seems to be a convenient signature to observe a formation of the pinned one - dimensional wigner crystal .",
    "however , in numerical simulations it is not quite evident how to quantify the localization of a correlated many body state .",
    "several indirect criteria such as the inverse participation number @xcite or the curvature of the ground state energy @xcite have been suggested to distinguish between a localized and a delocalized state .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the electrons ability to carry electric current  which is the most direct indication of the delocalized vs. localized behaviour  has not yet been explored . in this work",
    "we calculate the persistent current in a one - dimensional quantum ring penetrated by a magnetic flux .",
    "we apply a weak impurity potential which pins a wigner state but practically does not influence the electron liquid state .    in the density range where a wigner crystal already exists as a ground state",
    "the persistent current has been studied analytically by krive _",
    "et al._@xcite for smooth potentials allowing semiclassical treatment . in a perfect ring",
    "the wigner crystal rotates as a whole producing exactly the same current as non - interacting electrons . in the presence of a weak impurity potential",
    "the persistent current was found to be suppressed exponentially with the increasing impurity strength or the wigner crystal stiffness @xcite .",
    "we use density functional theory ( dft ) to calculate self - consistently the persistent current in a one - dimensional system with ten electrons . in the limit of vanishing ( on a scale of the inter - electron coulomb repulsion ) repulsive",
    "potential we find that the current is independent of @xmath0 for @xmath6 . at larger @xmath0 the persistent current decreases exponentially with increasing @xmath7 , indicating a localization of the electrons . at the transition",
    "point the system undergoes a second - order phase transition which can be seen by considering the amplitude of the density oscillations @xmath8 as an order parameter .",
    "we find that in a crystalline phase @xmath8 exactly follows a square root behaviour @xmath9 .",
    "the stronger pinning potentials smear the phase transition such that no distinct transition point can be observed .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model of a one - dimensional quantum ring with the gaussian impurity potential .",
    "we briefly discuss the oep approximation @xcite which is used for the exchange potential .",
    "we also introduce an electron localization function @xcite which is helpful for a real - space visualization of the electron localization . in section",
    "iii we describe the computational method for solving the self - consistent kohn - sham equations . in section",
    "iv we present our results for the persistent current as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we consider impurity potentials of various amplitude and width and show how these parameters influence the current .",
    "the conclusions are given in section v.",
    "we study a system of @xmath10 interacting spinless electrons in a one dimensional ring of circumference @xmath11 .",
    "the ring geometry is accounted for via periodic boundary conditions and @xmath12 denotes the coordinate along the ring .",
    "a persistent current is induced by a vector potential @xmath13 with a tangential component @xmath14 that provides a magnetic flux @xmath15 through the ring .",
    "the vector potential is chosen such that the electrons move in a field - free space .",
    "additionally , we introduce a repulsive gaussian potential centered at @xmath16 @xmath17 which should pin the wigner crystal phase .",
    "we calculate the ground state current density for a given value of the magnetic flux and for a given strength and width of the impurity potential using density functional theory .",

    "the electron - electron interaction is described by an effective one - particle scalar potential @xmath22 . here , @xmath23 is the hartree potential and @xmath24 is the exchange contribution .",
    "the latter is calculated in the kli version @xcite of the oep method @xcite .",
    "the central assumption of the oep method is that the exchange - correlation energy functional can be written explicitely in terms of the kohn - sham orbitals .",
    "a common choice is the `` exact exchange '' functional @xmath25 which has the form of the fock energy but the wavefunctions @xmath20 are the kohn - sham orbitals rather than the hartree - fock orbitals .",
    "minimization of the full energy functional with respect to the density leads to an integral equation for the exchange - correlation potential . in this work we use the exact - exchange functional and",
    "apply the kli approximation which allows to transform the oep integral equation into a considerably simpler algebraic equation .",
    "still , it retains important features of the exact xc potential such as the derivative discontinuities and correct asymptotic behaviour @xcite .",
    "since dft in the kohn - sham formulation is essentially a mean - field theory , fluctuations are not accounted for in our calculations .",
    "it is well known that fluctuations are particularly important in one dimension @xcite .",
    "but since even an infinite one - dimensional wigner crystal is stabilized by an arbitrarily weak pinning potential @xcite we expect that the fluctuations are effectively suppressed not only due to the pinning potential , but also due to the finite size of the ring .    whether the ground state of a many electron system is an electron gas - like one or a wigner crystal state depends on the ratio of the kinetic energy and the coulomb energy .",
    "in one dimension this ratio is simply proportional to the electron density @xmath26 , whereas in two and three dimensions it is proportional to @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "hence for high densities the kinetic energy dominates and the ground state is electron gas - like whereas for low densities the coulomb repulsion favours the crystalline state .    experimentally it is most straightforward to vary the electron density to switch between weakly and strongly interacting regimes . yet",
    "the variation of the electron number should alter the persistent current even in a non - interacting system which conceals the interaction effects .",
    "as we use a `` persistent current criterion '' to identify the wigner transition we prefer to exclude the aforementioned trivial single particle contribution and to retain only the influence of many - body effects . it can be done using an alternative ( though somewhat artificial ) way of controlling the ratio of kinetic and coulomb energy .",
    "namely , let us consider the effective electron mass @xmath29 as a free parameter . in one dimension ,",
    "the energy ratio @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the bohr radius and the `` true '' effective electron mass in the host material .",
    "the persistent current density @xmath33\\\\    -\\frac{\\hbar}{m_{0}^{\\ast}}\\frac{2\\pi}{l}\\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_{0}}n(x )    \\label{eq : current}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] should be calculated with the fixed `` true '' effective electron mass @xmath32 . here",
    ", @xmath34 is the flux quantum and @xmath35 is the density .",
    "also , the ratio of the kinetic energy to the impurity potential must be kept constant when changing @xmath0 via changing @xmath29 . otherwise the current density of a system of non - interacting electrons",
    "would depend on @xmath0 .",
    "the impurity potential strength @xmath36 must be renormalized as @xmath37    the potential renormalization ( [ potrenorm ] ) guarantees that the artificial variation of the electron mass results in a dependence of the persistent current on @xmath0 solely due to the electron - electron interaction .",
    "equation ( [ eq : current ] ) expresses the current density via the kohn - sham orbitals within the framework of the ordinary density - based dft .",
    "it is not , however , strictly justified since the common dft kohn - sham equations by construction yield the exact ground state density but not the current density .",
    "strictly speaking , one has to employ the current density functional theory @xcite ( cdft ) which expresses the ground - state energy functional as a functional of the density and the paramagnetic current density .",
    "the kohn - sham orbitals in cdft thus give the exact current density of the interacting system .",
    "however , the cdft corrections are , as a matter of fact , usually very small .",
    "for example in a recent paper @xcite is shown that the orbital magnetic moments in magnetic ( fe , co and ni ) and non - magnetic ( si and ge ) solids calculated with cdft only slightly differ from those calculated with dft .",
    "hence we expect that eq .",
    "( [ eq : current ] ) evaluates the current reasonably well , keeping in mind , that for our purposes not the current value itself , but its critical @xmath0-dependence close to the wigner transition is of interest .",
    "in addition to the current density we also use the electron localization function ( elf ) @xcite to visualize the electrons localization .",
    "the idea behind the definition of the elf is that the more localized electron produces a stronger repulsion of the other like - spin electrons due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "according to this picture the elf measures the probability to find a second electron ( with the parallel spin ) anywhere close to a reference electron .",
    "it is defined such that its value of one half means a homogeneous electron - gas like state whereas a value of one refers to a perfectly localized electron at this point in space .    in its original definition @xcite",
    "the elf was formulated for the real wavefunctions only .",
    "recently it was generalized to the time - dependent case @xcite where complex wavefunctions have to be employed .",
    "this form of the elf is also suitable for the current - carrying static system we consider .",
    "it is given by @xmath38 with @xmath39 in this expression @xmath40 is the kinetic energy density of the kohn - sham system and @xmath41 is the respective quantity in a one - dimensional homogeneous electron gas with density @xmath42 .",
    "for numerical solution of the kohn - sham equations ( [ ks - eq ] ) we use a real space method .",
