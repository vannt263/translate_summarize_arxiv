    "the classical arnold - liouville theorem @xcite describes the geometry of an integrable hamiltonian system ( ihs ) with @xmath0 degrees of freedom near regular level sets of the moment map : locally near every regular invariant torus there is a system of action - angle coordinates , and the corresponding foliation by invariant lagrangian tori is trivial . in particular , there is a free symplectic @xmath0-dimensional torus action which preserves the moment map .",
    "the local base space of this trivial foliation is a disk equipped with a unique natural integral affine structure , given by the action coordinates .",
    "a good account on action - angle coordinates , and their generation for mishchenko - fomenko noncommutative integrable systems and libermann symplectically complete foliations , can be found in the paper @xcite by dazord and delzant , and references therein .    however , ihs s met in classical mechanics and physics always have singularities , and most often these singularities are nondegenerate in a natural sense .",
    "thus the study of nondegenerate singularities ( = tubular neighborhoods of singular level sets of the moment map ) is one of the main step toward understanding the topological structure of general ihs s .",
    "the question is : what can be said about the structure of nondegenerate singularities of ihs s ?",
    "what remains true from arnold - liouville theorem in this case ?    in recent years , several significant results have been obtained concerning this question .",
    "firstly , the local structure of nondegenerate singularities is now well - understood , due to the works by birkhoff , williamson , rssmann , vey and eliasson ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the second well - understood thing is elliptic singularities and systems `` de type torique '' , through the works by dufour , molino and others ( cf . e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , boucetta and molino @xcite observed that the orbit space of the integrable system in case of elliptic singularities is a singular integral affine manifold with a simple singular structure .",
    "integrable systems with elliptic singularities are closely related to torus actions on symplectic manifolds , which were studied by duistermaat , heckman and others ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "third , codimension 1 nondegenerate singularities were studied by fomenko @xcite from the topological point of view , and was shown to admit a system of @xmath1 action and @xmath1 angle coordinates in my thesis @xcite .",
    "fourth , some simple cases of codimension 2 singularities were studied by lerman , umanskii and others ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , for general nondegenerate singularities , the question had remained open .",
    "here we listed only `` abstract '' works .",
    "there are many authors who studied singularities of concrete well - known integrable systems , from different viewpoints , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a more or less satisfactory answer to the question posed above , which incorporates cited results .",
    "namely , we will show that , for a nondegenerate singularity of codimension @xmath2 in an ihs with @xmath0 degrees of freedom there is still a locally free symplectic torus group action ( of dimension @xmath3 ) , which preserves the moment map .",
    "there is a normal finite covering of the singularity , for which the above torus action becomes free , and the obtained torus bundle structure is topologically trivial .",
    "there is a coisotropic section to this trivial bundle , which gives rise to a set of @xmath4 action and @xmath4 angle coordinates . and the most important result , which completes the picture is as follows : the singular lagrangian foliation associated to a nondegenerate singularity is , up to a normal finite covering , homeomorphic to a direct product of singular lagrangian foliations of simplest ( codimension 1 and/or focus - focus codimension 2 ) singularities .    thus , we have the following topological classification of nondegenerate singularities of integrable hamiltonian systems : every such singularity has a unique natural , i.e. when the singularity contains a fixed point , but when @xmath5 in some cases it s false . when it s false , the number of minimal models is finite ] canonical model ( or may be also called minimal model because of its minimality ) , which is a direct - product singularity with a free component - wise action of a finite group on it , cf . theorem",
    "[ thm : adp ] .",
    "this finite group is a topological invariant of the singularity , and may be called galois group .    canonical models for geodesic flows on multi - dimensional ellipsoids were computed in @xcite . in @xcite we will discuss how the method of separation of variables allows one to compute canonical model of singularities of integrable systems .",
    "it is an interesting problem to study singularities of systems which are integrable by other methods ( lie - group theoretic , isospectral deformation , etc . ) . in this direction ,",
    "some results connected with lie algebras were obtained by bolsinov @xcite .",
    "isospectral deformation was deployed by audin for some systems @xcite .",
    "all the results listed above are true under a mild condition of topological stability .",
    "this condition is satisfied for all nondegenerate singularities of all known ihs s met in mechanics and physics .",
    "( notice that this condition is rather a structural stability but not a stability in lyapunov s sense ) . without this condition , some of the above results still hold .",
    "we suspect that our results ( with some modifications ) are also valid for integrable pde . in this direction , some results were obtained by ercolani and mclaughlin @xcite .",
    "( note : there seems to be an inaccuracy in theorem 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the above results have direct consequences in the global topological study of ihs s , which are discussed in @xcite .",
    "for example , one obtains that the singular orbit space of a nondegenerate ihs is a stratified integral affine manifold in a natural sense , and one can compute homologies by looking at the bifurcation diagram , etc .",
    "our results may be useful also for perturbation theory of nearly integrable systems ( see e.g. @xcite for some results concerning the use of the topology of singularities of ihs s in poincar - melnikov method ) , and for geometric quantization .",
    "* about the notations*. in this paper , @xmath6 denotes a torus , @xmath7 a disk , @xmath8 the integral numbers , @xmath9 the real numbers , @xmath10 the complex numbers , @xmath11 the two element group .",
    "all ihs s are assumed to be smooth , nonresonant , and by abuse of language , they are identified with poisson actions generated by @xmath0 commuting first integrals .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a treatment of arnold - liouville theorem , and when we say that we use this theorem we will often in fact use the following statement : if @xmath12 is a vector field with periodic flow such that on each liouville torus it equals a linear combination of hamiltonian vector fields of first integrals , then @xmath12 is a symplectic vector field .    *",
    "organization of the paper*. in section [ section : local ] we recall the main known results about the local structure of nondegenerate singularities of ihs s .",
    "section [ section : singleaf ] is devoted to some a priori non - local properties of nondegenerate singularities and singular lagrangian foliations associated to ihs s .",
    "then in section [ section : codim1 ] and section [ section : focus ] we describe the structure of nondegenerate singularities in two simplest cases : codimension 1 hyperbolic and codimension 2 focus - focus . the main results , however , are contained in the subsequent sections , where we prove the existence of hamiltonian torus actions in the general case , topological decomposition , and action - angle coordinates . in the last section we briefly discuss various notions of nondegenerate ihs s , and the use of integrable surgery in obtaining interesting symplectic structures and ihs s .",

    "point @xmath25 is called simple if @xmath57 , i.e. if @xmath25 is either codimension 1 elliptic , codimension 1 hyperbolic , or codimension 2 focus - focus .",
    "it is useful to know the group of local linear automorphisms for simple fixed points of linear ihs s ( with one or two degrees of freedom respectively ) , for these local linear automorphisms serve as components of the linearization of local automorphisms of nonlinear ihs s .",

    "note that in eliasson s paper there are some minor inaccuracies ( e.g. lemma 6 ) , and there is only a sketch of the proof of symplectomorphism for cases other than elliptic . for elliptic case , a new proof is given by dufour and molino @xcite .",
    "lerman and umanskii @xcite also considered the smooth case with @xmath48 , but their results are somewhat weaker than the above theorem . rigorously speaking , the cited papers proved the above theorem only for the case of fixed points .",

    "thus the local topological structure of the singular lagrangian foliation near a nondegenerate singular point is the same as of a linear poisson action , up to diffeomorphisms .",
    "it is diffeomorphic to a direct product of a non - singular component and simple singular components . here",
    "a non - singular component means a local regular foliation of dimension @xmath3 and codimension @xmath3 , a simple singular component is a singular foliation associated to a simple singular fixed point .",
    "in particular , if @xmath25 is a nondegenerate singular point , then we can describe the local level set of the moment map which contains @xmath25 as follows : if @xmath25 is a codimension 1 elliptic fixed point @xmath75 , then this set is just one point @xmath25 .",

    "the local level set is diffeomorphic to a direct product of local level sets corresponding to the above simple cases , and a disk of dimension equal to the rank of the moment map at @xmath25 .",
    "note that the cross and 2-dimensional cross have a natural stratification ( into one 0-dimensional stratum and four 1-dimensional strata ; one 0-dimensional stratum and two 2-dimensional strata respectively ) .",

    "also , the local structure of nondegenerate singular leaves is given by proposition [ prop : locallevelset ] .",
    "one can imagine a singular leaf , at least in case it is nondegenerate , as a stratified manifold - the stratification given by the orbits of various dimensions , and the codimension of the leaf equals @xmath0 minus the smallest dimension of the orbits .",

    "all singularities are assumed to be nondegenerate .",
    "recall that , given an ihs in @xmath16 , its orbit space has a natural topology which we will use : the preimages of open subsets of the orbit space are saturated open subsets of @xmath100 .",

    "thus , the orbit space , under the condition of nondegeneracy , is a good topological space . a point in the orbit space @xmath101",

    "this assumption is called topological stability .",
