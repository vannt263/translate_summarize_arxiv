    "the observed flatness of rotation curves of spiral galaxies implies the existence of massive halos of dark matter extending to r @xmath7 30 kpc . the rate of microlensing observed toward the lmc suggests that a substantial fraction of the dark halo surrounding the galaxy is in the form of massive compact halo objects ( machos ) with masses in the range of 0.05 - 1 m@xmath8 ( alcock et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the nature of these objects is not known but , due to their gravitational effects and the difficulty in their detection , they must have high mass - to - light ratios and could be black holes , cool low - mass stars , white dwarfs or brown dwarfs .",
    "low - mass stars and brown dwarfs are both potentially detectable in near - infrared bands .",
    "ngc 5907 is a nearby edge - on sb galaxy located at ( r.a , decl . )",
    "= ( 15h 15.9 m , 56@xmath9 19 ) with an inclination angle of 87@xmath9 .",
    "its distance , from fisher and tully ( 1981 ) , is taken to be 11.4 mpc ( for h@xmath10 = 75 km s@xmath11mpc@xmath11 ) , giving a linear scale of 3.3 kpc arcmin@xmath11 .",
    "barnaby and thronson ( 1992 ) observed it in the near - infrared ( nir ) and reported its h band ( 1.68 @xmath0 m ) bulge - to - disk luminosity ratio to be low , 0.05 . based on their models ( barnaby and thronson 1994 ) , estimates for the h - band bulge light of this galaxy at 5 , 10 , 20 kpc from its center are 24 , 6 , and 1 nw m@xmath3sr@xmath11 , respectively .",
    "sackett et al .",
    "( 1994 ) reported the detection in the r - band of a faint halo of emission at r = 6 kpc about this galaxy .",
    "this result was confirmed by lequeux et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in the v and i bands and by james and casali ( 1996 ) and rudy et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the j and k bands .",
    "rudy et al . found the observed color to be peculiar and best modelled by low - mass stars with near - solar metallicity .",
    "recently , shang et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found a faint ring extending to @xmath1240 kpc from the plane of the galaxy , evidence for recent tidal disruption of the disk of ngc 5907 , and raised the issue of whether the emission detected at r@xmath126 kpc is associated with the dark halo , or with a disrupted component of the disk .",
    "most recently , zheng et al.(1999 ) have obtained deep intermediate - band photometry to distances of @xmath12 15 kpc at 6660 and 8020 , which can be compared to the wider bands r and i. their results are in good agreement with previous , published results , yet their analysis concludes that any excess light seen does not originate from the inferred symmetrical dark halo .",
    "instead , they attribute the asymmetric surface brightness as an artifact of the faint ring and of residual light from imperfectly masked stars .",
    "finally , zepf et al . ( 2000 ) imaged a region at 4.4 kpc from the galaxy center with the nicmos instrument on the hst and detected far fewer stars than expected for a normal stellar population with the expected near - solar metallicity . the connection between the faint extended emission around ngc 5907 and the halo of matter that extends to r @xmath7 30 kpc remains in doubt .",
    "a spherical halo that produces a flat rotation curve is constrained to have a mass density proportional to r@xmath3 . therefore , assuming that the mass - to - light ration ( m / l ) of the halo is constant implies that the surface brightness of the halo will scale as r@xmath11 .",
    "emission from the disk and bulge of the galaxy drops off more rapidly with radius than the required r@xmath11 of such a halo .",
    "therefore any emission from the halo should be separated more easily from that of the disk and bulge at large galactic radii ; the halo would be easier to detect against the galaxy .",
    "experiments sensitive to larger radii , ( uemizu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , bock et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ) , are also less likely to be contaminated by components of the disk and allow for an accurate determination of the sky brightness - important factors in light of recent work by zheng et al .",
    "consequently , deep nir observations of the galaxy extending to larger radii are important to answer the question of the existence and nature of ngc 5907 s halo .",
    "unfortunately , most ground - based observations have limited sensitivity to a halo at large radii because of the difficulty in detecting low surface brightness against the night - sky background .",
    "nite , the near - infrared telescope experiment , is a lhe - cooled , wide - field , 3.5 - 5@xmath0 m camera that is carried above the earth s atmosphere by a sounding rocket .",
    "the background against which a faint halo must be detected is dominated by the zodiacal light which is at a minimum at these wavelengths .",
    "this wavelength band is also near optimum for detecting low - mass stars and brown dwarfs , both because they are relatively brighter in this band and because the disk and bulge of the galaxy are relatively dimmer .",
    "a halo formed of these objects may be detected more easily at longer wavelengths than the optical bands used from the ground .",
    "as well , recent models ( allard et al . 1997 ) suggest that searches at 4.5 - 5@xmath0 m should offer the best possibility for finding brown dwarfs .",
    "the optical system consists of a 16.5 cm , f/2.2-folded gregorian telescope .",
    "the 256@xmath1256 indium - antimonide ( insb ) array is located at the focal plane . the image scale is 17  pixel@xmath11 ; the total field is 1.2@xmath9@xmath11.2@xmath9 .",
    "the array is continuously read out at a 3.8 hz frame rate using a `` sampling up the ramp '' technique implemented to simplify the flight electronics and provide the maximum flexibility in post - flight data analysis .",
    "the array is reset every 10s to avoid saturation on bright stars .",
    "the entire optical system is cooled below 30 k within a supercritical helium cryostat . the insb array is maintained at 30 k to optimize its performance .",
    "previous results obtained with nite are reported in uemizu et al .",
    "further details concerning the instrument are given by bock et al .",
    "the instrument was launched from the white sands missile range , new mexico , at 00:22 ( mdt ) , 1998 may 22 on a black brant ix ( 36.175 ur ) sounding rocket .",
    "the payload separated from the rocket motor at 86 s after launch and the experiment door opened . the cooled telescope extended outside of the payload at 90 s so that the cooled baffle tube would not view the emission from the warm payload door . at 132",
    "s the lid covering the telescope aperture deployed , and the cold shutter in front of the field stop opened , commencing observations of the sky . at 473",
    "s , the shutter closed , terminating the observation .",
    "the telescope observed ngc 5907 during most of this time . during the flight , the detector temperature remained stable , varying less than 0.2@xmath5 during the observations .",
    "the temperatures of the cooled mirror and baffle tube were also stable throughout the observations .    in order to",
    "accurately correct variations in responsivity across the array , the galaxy was placed sequentially at four different positions across the array , acquiring two 10 s exposures at each position .",
    "we intended to image the galaxy at the center of each quadrant of the array , but an offset in the attitude control system shifted the images toward one corner of the array .",
    "after one cycle of eight exposures , the positions were deliberately offset by several pixels for the second cycle , for a total of sixteen 10 s exposures .",
    "we observed a contaminating source of emission , probably caused by emission from the tumbling booster , during the middle of the second image cycle .",
    "this contaminated the sky background sufficiently ( raising the background flux from 320 to 720 nw m@xmath3sr@xmath11 from exposures 10 to 16 , see figure 1 ) that only the first 10 exposures were used in the analysis .",
    "the bright calibration star @xmath13 dra , separated from the galaxy by @xmath123.3 degrees , was observed at the beginning and at the end of the observations .",
    "the first observation of @xmath13 dra , which was well - centered on the array , as well as the guide star @xmath14 boo , were used to characterize the point - spread function and to calibrate the camera .",
    "we processed the images to remove instrumental and environmental effects . a _",
    "master dark frame _ was made from a set of 11 dark frames obtained @xmath1230 minutes before launch with the cold shutter closed .",
    "the value of each pixel in the master dark frame was determined by taking the median of the dark frame values at that pixel and iteratively removing outlying ( more than 3@xmath4 from the median ) values ( _ 3@xmath4 clipping _ ) .",
    "we formed _ dark - subtracted frames _ by subtracting this master dark frame from each of the 10 frames used in the analysis .",
    "we removed point sources from each of these dark - subtracted frames by iterative 3@xmath4 clipping .",
    "the average flux in the remaining pixels was taken to be the average _ sky level _ of each of the frames .    a relative gain correction ( _ flat - field frame _ )",
    "was derived from the sky data .",
    "each of the dark - subtracted frames was normalized by its average sky level .",
    "a large region ( 30 kpc ) about the galaxy was masked out .",
    "the average of the 10 frames at each position in the array was iteratively 3@xmath4 clipped to produce a preliminary _",
    "sky flat_. pixels where the 3@xmath4 clipping left no remaining data for either the master dark frame or the sky flat were not used in subsequent analysis .",
    "each dark - subtracted frame was divided by the preliminary sky flat and then again iteratively 3@xmath4 clipped to produce the flat - fielded sky levels .",
    "these levels were removed from the dark - subtracted , flat - fielded frames .",
    "a mosaic image was formed from these 10 frames .",
    "the frames were registered relative to one another by iteratively offsetting images to maximize the correlation function of the two images .",
    "we measured the point - spread function ( psf ) using a combination of bright ( but not saturated ) field stars , the calibration star @xmath13 dra and the bright guide star @xmath14 boo .",
    "the psf drops to 5@xmath110@xmath15 of its maximum at a radius of 28. the psf has a faint extended envelope that is likely caused by imperfections on the primary mirror .",
    "the psf is approximately circular with a radial dependence of r@xmath16 + 0.021r@xmath17 as shown in figure 2 .",
    "a preliminary mask was generated by treating as foreground stars all pixels @xmath18 3 @xmath4 above the sky background and masking out all pixels within a radius where the brightness of the point source would exceed 2.5 nw m@xmath3sr@xmath11 ( 0.5 of the sky background noise ) .",
    "the process of creating the sky flat was iterated , applying the preliminary mask at the outset in order to eliminate residual contamination in the sky background levels and in the pixels used to create the sky flat .",
    "the new sky flat had a small proportion ( @xmath126@xmath5 ) of its pixels where no value could be assigned due to a lack of data ; for these pixels , there was no image that did not contain a `` star '' .",
    "these pixels were ignored in subsequent analysis .",
    "the second sky flat and set of sky levels were used to produce the final mosaic image , shown in figure 3 .",
    "the initial mosaic image had a residual background level ; the usefulness of reprocessing was evidenced by the disappearance of the residual in the iterated image .",
    "a final point - source mask was made from the iterated image in the manner described above , and this mask was used to iterate the entire process of forming the image one more time .",
    "although the loss of data owing to a lack of flat - field information increased in the second iteration , our analysis of the radial profile of the galaxy , described below , was stable .",
    "the result of the first iteration , shown in figure 3 , was used in the final analysis .    to determine the surface brightness profile of the galaxy ,",
    "as described below , a @xmath1945@xmath9 wedge was added to the final mask in order to remove the contamination of the disk of ngc 5907 to the surface brightness profile .",
    "the final image of the galaxy is shown with the mask applied in figure 4 .",
    "the surface brightness was calibrated to @xmath19 3@xmath5 ( statistical uncertainty ) using photometry on the stars @xmath13 dra ( johnson 1966 ) and @xmath14 boo ( ukirt standards , www.jach.hawaii.edu/ jacpublic/ukirt/astronomy/calib/ukirt@xmath20stds.html ) , with zero - magnitude fluxes from johnson ( 1965 ) and cohen et al .",
    "the psf was used to correct for saturation .",
    "the 1 @xmath4 dispersion of the sky background per pixel in the regions of the combined image that we use in this analysis is approximately 5 nw m@xmath3sr@xmath11 .",
    "the measured sky brightness is 291@xmath1910 nw m@xmath3sr@xmath11 in our band , which is in rough agreement with dirbe results at a solar elongation of 90@xmath9 ( leinert et al .",
    "the surface brightness profile is produced by averaging pixels in circular annuli , each 1 pixel ( 17  ) wide , centered on the galaxy .",
    "the averaging process used a set of relative weights based upon the number of individual exposures used to obtain the pixel in the mosaiced image .",
    "the noise calculated on the average used this set of relative weights as well . an iterative 3@xmath4 rejection on the pixels of each annulus eliminates any residual point sources .",
    "a spherically symmetric halo with a flat rotation curve has a mass density    @xmath21    the mass column density distribution , @xmath22 , is obtained by integrating along a line of sight through the spherically symmetric halo .",
    "@xmath23    the rotation curve is measured out to a distance of 32 kpc ; at large radii the rotational velocity is 220 km s@xmath11 ( sancisi and van alhada 1987 ) . using this and the solar output in our",

    "the measured flux from 1 to 35 ( 3.3 - 116 kpc ) is fitted to a four - parameter function , ar@xmath28 + br@xmath11 + c. the first term traces the emission from the bulge and disk of the galaxy including the effects of the finite psf ; the last term fits for any systematic residual of the sky background after processing ; and the second term , br@xmath11 , tests for the existence of a halo following the mass distribution for a flat rotation curve .",
    "figure 5 plots the surface brightness profile of ngc 5907 .",

    "the reduced @xmath30@xmath31 of the fit is 1.32 for 118 degrees of freedom .",
    "the result of @xmath30@xmath31 greater than 1 may be due to either residual structure from flat fielding errors at 1@xmath5 of the sky background , an imperfect model , or additional structure on the sky .",
    "a possible source of bias for the halo component b is the wings of the psf .",
    "the extended wing is a positive component , and would tend to force a false positive result for b. therefore , a value of b consistent with zero is not caused by the halo being hidden by the psf .",
    "our result is a non - detection of the halo with a 1@xmath4 statistical uncertainty of 1.4 nw arcmin m@xmath3sr@xmath11 , corresponding to a brightness of @xmath12 0.1@xmath5 of the zodiacal light background at a radius of @xmath12 15 kpc .",

    "if we assume that the detections of emission at shorter wavelengths and smaller radii shown in figure 6 are sampling the same population of sources , then the spectrum of m / l for ngc 5907 does not present a consistent picture for the halo .",

    "a possible resolution of the discrepancy is that the emission detected at r@xmath610 kpc by several groups is associated with a source that does not dominate the halo at larger radii .",

    "( 1998 ) measured a significant warp along the galaxy to @xmath1240 kpc and an ellipse - shaped ring structure perpendicular to the galaxy out to @xmath1240 kpc , suggestive of a past interaction between ngc 5907 and a dwarf galaxy .",
    "a dwarf irregular galaxy is present at the end of the observed warp in the disk of ngc 5907 .",
    "if this interaction has disrupted the bulge of the galaxy , the bulge s mass density may drop off less steeply than the @xmath12r@xmath39 that is usually observed .",
    "the edge of the bulge could then mimic a halo at small radii , but may not extend throughout the whole of the dark halo .",
    "therefore , the outer halo could be composed of an entirely different population from the inner halo , or nonbaryonic matter .",
