    "quantum tunneling has always been one of the most fascinating  and counterintuitive  manifestation of quantum phenomena in nature  @xcite . among the most well - known examples of this kind ,",
    "are non - planar molecules , in which an atom or a group of atoms oscillates between the two wells of the potential energy surface , also at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "there has been a great amount of interest in the study of coherent tunneling in molecular systems , and how and under which physical conditions this coherence may be suppressed due to environmental interactions  @xcite .",
    "the relevant property of the molecule can be effectively modeled by a particle of mass @xmath1 moving in a double - well potential @xmath2 with two minima at @xmath3 ; here @xmath4 is a generalized inversion coordinate .",
    "the minima , associated with the two localized ( say , chiral ) states of the molecule , are separated by a barrier @xmath5 . if we denote the small - amplitude vibration in either well by @xmath6 , then in the limit @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the temperature of the bath and @xmath9 is boltzmann constant ) , the state of the system is effectively confined in the two - dimensional hilbert space spanned by the two lowest eigenstates .    as custom ,",
    "we denote by @xmath10 and @xmath11 the ground and first excited state of the relevant part of the hamiltonian , separated by the energy difference @xmath12 .",
    "they are delocalized states , since they must be also eigenstates of the parity operator .",
    "the localized  or chiral  states , are the combinations : @xmath13 where @xmath14 has @xmath15 as eigenstates .",
    "the position operator @xmath16 reduces to @xmath17 , which has the localized states @xmath18 as eigenstates .",
    "a very interesting problem is the behavior of a non - planar molecule in a gas , and how the tunneling between different classical configurations depends on the thermodynamic variables of the gas .",
    "several approaches have been developed , for analyzing the system - bath interaction .",
    "one of the best understood ones is decoherence  @xcite , and in particular collisional decoherence  @xcite , which is ubiquitous in quantum physics .",
    "the application of decoherence to the study of the coherent tunneling of a molecule in a gas has been first done by  @xcite .",
    "different alternative approaches to the problem include the mean field theory  @xcite , or various modeling of the dephasing process induced by intermolecular interactions  @xcite , by photons  @xcite , or by phonons  @xcite",
    ". however , decoherence seems to cover the widest ranges of physical situations .    when analyzing decoherence phenoma , the starting point is the lindblad - type master equation  @xcite , which in the two - dimensional approximation reads : @xmath19 -\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\left(\\hat{\\rho}-\\hat{\\sigma}_{z}\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{\\sigma}_{z}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the density matrix of the relevant molecule , and @xmath21 the decoherence rate .",
    "the task of ( collisional ) decoherence is to give a microscopic expression for @xmath21 . in this article",
    "we propose a general master formula for computing the decoherence rate @xmath21 for non - planar molecules .",
    "the advantage of our formula  differently from previous approaches  is that it can be easily applied to many different molecules in a large variety of background gases .",
    "as we will show , even in its simplest form , it gives results which are in excellent agreement with known data .",
    "the key , and simple , observation is that energy eigenstates are superpositions in _ space _ of one or more atoms of the molecule , and for this reason they decohere upon interaction with an environment .",
    "therefore we may apply the theory of quantum brownian motion  @xcite to such atoms , in order to compute the loss of coherence due to the scattering with the bath particles . in the dilute gas limit , and when the scattering is recoil - free , the decoherence master equation takes the form @xcite : @xmath22|\\textbf{x}'\\rangle -f\\left(\\textbf{x}-\\textbf{x}'\\right)\\left\\langle \\textbf{x}|\\hat{\\rho}|\\textbf{x}'\\right\\rangle\\ ] ] with @xmath23 the hamiltonian of the isolated brownian particle , @xmath24 its position eigenstates , and : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the density of bath particles , @xmath27 the reduced mass of bath particles , @xmath28 the bath particle momentum , @xmath29 the distribution of such momenta , and : @xmath30 is the decoherence cross section ; @xmath31 is the scattering amplitude , and @xmath32 the scattering angle between directions @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    in the limit where the two - dimensional approximation is valid",
    ", the spatial coherence is between the two minima of the double  well potential , which are separated by a distance @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that , for all important bath particles momenta @xmath28 , the decoherence cross section @xmath36 does not change appreciably .",
    "we can then write : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the most probable momentum , for an ideal gas at equilibrium at temperature @xmath8 . for isotropic scattering ,",
    "we have  @xcite : @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "( [ tab : eq4 ] ) can be easily computed in two limiting cases : the low temperature limit @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 ; and the high temperature limit @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 .    for values of @xmath6 in the infra  red range ( @xmath45@xmath46hz ) , which is the typical range of molecular vibrations , @xmath47 of the order of few angstrom , and @xmath27 of @xmath48@xmath49 for masses of typical background gases ( e.g. , from h@xmath0 to air ) , one has : @xmath50@xmath51 and @xmath52@xmath53 .",
    "this means that both the two dimensional approximation and the high temperature limit are valid in most interesting physical situations . in this case",
    ", the variable @xmath54 is large , @xmath55 , thus : @xmath56 , which is the total cross - section .",
    "if we consider the scattering interaction as given by a central potential and use the phase - shift method @xcite , the scattering amplitude @xmath57 can be expressed as : @xmath58 , with @xmath59 the legendre polynomials , and @xmath60 the phase shifts .",
    "the phase shifts have suitable integral representations depending on the scattering potential . collecting the above results",
    ", we can write : @xmath61 where we used @xmath62 .",
    "( [ tab : eq5 ] ) and , with it , decoherence theory , is very powerful : it tells that the effect of a gas medium on the tunneling properties of a molecule can be reduced to the two - body interaction ( scattering ) between the relevant molecule and a single gas molecule .",
    "the gas as a whole enters only though its thermodynamics parameters .",
    "( [ tab : eq5 ] ) is also very general , because can be immediately applied to any situation , where a non - planar molecule is immersed in a gas medium ( within the limits of validity of the general approach , previoulsy discussed ) .",
    "( [ tab : eq5 ] ) is also independent from the internal - rotational states of the non - planar molecule .",
    "computing the phase shifts @xmath60 can prove quite hard .",
    "one can provide a handy expression in the hard - sphere limit : @xmath63 $ ] with @xmath64 the distance of closest approach of the centers of the two colliding spheres , @xmath65 the spherical bessel functions and @xmath66 the spherical neumann functions  @xcite .",
    "the hard - sphere limit is the zero - th order approximation one can make .",
    "however it turns out to be very good , because intermolecular interactions typically have a finite effective range , and the main contribution to @xmath21 comes essentially from scattering in this effective region . considering the effective range as that of a hard - sphere",
    ", we can find a very simple and general expression for @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , as we will show in the following examples , the hard - sphere limit provides a very good description of decoherence effects in the tunneling properties of a molecule .",
    "it also offers a geometric , and very intuitive , way to understand the decoherence mechanism , reducing it to the bouncing of two spheres . in this way",
    ", one can understand why , in the calculations , one has to include a steric factor @xmath67 , which takes into account only those directions of approach of a gas molecule , which can contribute to decoherence : an atom attached to a molecule can be `` hit '' by a bath particle only from the directions which are not hindered by the rest of the molecule .",
    "we now apply this setup to two interesting physical situations .",
    "in  @xcite , the inversion - line frequency of ammonia has been experimentally measured as a function of the gas pressure @xmath68 .",
    "the frequency is found to decrease from 0.78 @xmath69 at @xmath70 , to zero above @xmath71 atm ( see fig .  [ trid ] ) . this phenomenon was first explained qualitatively in @xcite ; to our knowledge",
    ", the first complete theoretical analysis is provided in @xcite , based on the mean field theory .",
    "the inversion frequency turns out to be : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the critical pressure derived theoretically .",
    "the theoretical formula , reported in fig .  [ trid ] , is in very good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the mean field theory provides a ` static ' approach to the problem .",
    "decoherence theory provides a ` dynamical ' approach , and its predictions partly differ , as we now show .",
    "this comes through the explicit solution of eq .",
    "( [ tab : eq2 ] ) . by writing @xmath74 , all information is contained in the bloch vector @xmath75 .",
    "the experimental results obtained by cavity - resonator technique are connected to the relative occupation probability @xmath76 @xcite , whose time evolution , in the under  damped case , reads @xcite : @xmath77,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the characteristic inversion frequency , @xmath78 , is : @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "since the experiment in  @xcite has been performed at room temperature , the high temperature limit holds and , according to eq .",
    "( [ tab : eq5 ] ) , we can write the critical pressure as follows : @xmath81 as expected , eq .",
    "( [ eq : decrate ] ) predicts a decrease of the inversion frequency , due to the interaction of each molecule with the rest of the gas .",
    "moreover , eq .  ( [ eq : pcr ] ) provides a microscopic expression for @xmath82 , without free parameters .    a good estimate for the total cross section @xmath83 can be provided in the hard - sphere limit , previously discussed .",
    "the hard - sphere radius is equal to twice the effective hard - sphere radius of ammonia ( @xmath84  ) @xcite . in computing the total cross section",
    ", the relevant contribution comes from those terms with @xmath85 @xcite ; this gives @xmath86 ( where @xmath87 is bohr radius ) .",
    "in the calculations , we have chosen the masses as follows . according to the double - well description",
    ", the mass @xmath1 of the brownian particle corresponds to the reduced mass @xmath88  @xcite with @xmath89 mass of hydrogen and @xmath90 mass of nitrogen .",
    "the mass @xmath27 entering the calculation of the total cross section and of the decoherence rate refers to the reduced mass of the brownian and bath particle ( @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) of  @xcite ) : @xmath92 , with @xmath93 the mass of ammonia .",
    "we have to multiply the cross section by a steric factor @xmath94 , since not all collisions of a bath particle with the brownian particle result to decoherence ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) ) . by taking @xmath95 @xmath69 and @xmath96k  @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pcr ] ) gives : @xmath97atm .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ trid ] , eq .",
    "( [ eq : decrate ] ) matches well the experimental data at low pressures , but clearly fails at high pressures .",
    "this does not come as a surprise , since the microscopic model used to compute @xmath21 is valid only in the diluted gas case . as explained in @xcite , in the case of ammonia ,",
    "the region @xmath98 , where many - body collisions become important , is far from the dilute gas limit .",
    "it is important to note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : decrate ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : decratejl ] ) predict a different behavior at very low pressures . while , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : decrate ] ) , the inversion frequency @xmath78 approaches @xmath99 with an horizontal slope for @xmath100 , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : decratejl ] ) the slope is negative .",
    "the experimental data seem to suggest that the slope gradually becomes horizontal , confirming our prediction .    .",
    "the dots are experimental data taken from  @xcite ; the solid line refers to eq .",
    "( [ eq : decrate ] ) , with @xmath101atm ; the dashed line refers to eq .",
    "( [ eq : decratejl ] ) of  @xcite , with @xmath102atm . in both cases ,",
    "@xmath99 ( frequency at @xmath103 ) has been taken equal to 0.78 @xmath69 , as reported in  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    there is also a strong theoretical reason why it should be so .",
    "( [ eq : decrate ] ) is a direct consequence of eq .",
    "( [ tab : eq2 ] ) , i.e. of a lindblad - type master equation , which is the result of very general mathematical requirements , such as the quantum dynamical semigroup ( qds ) structure , and complete positivity  @xcite .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to perform the experiment again , to assess the low pressure behavior of the inversion - line frequency of ammonia .",
    "in  @xcite the decoherence rate @xmath21 of a bath of helium ( he ) on a @xmath104 molecule is studied with heavy numerical machinery .",
    "actually , its value is not explicitly given , but can be estimated from eq .",
    "( 2 ) of the paper .",
    "we assume that the decoherence cross section @xmath105 ( notation of  @xcite ) is constant over significant bath particles momenta and , according to fig .",
    "( 1 ) of the paper , equal to @xmath106 for the considered temperature @xmath107 .",
    "then eq .",
    "( 2 ) of the paper gives @xmath108hz .",
    "we now apply our framework to give an independent estimate for @xmath21 , using eq .",
    "( [ tab : eq5 ] ) . the brownian particle has the reduced mass @xmath109 with @xmath110 the mass of sulfur and @xmath111 the mass of deuterium .",
    "for @xmath27 we use @xmath112 with @xmath113 the mass of he . in the hard - sphere limit ,",
    "it is reasonable to consider @xmath64 as the sum of the hard - sphere radius of he ( 1.085  ) and the van der waals radius of d ( 1.2  )  @xcite . under the conditions of @xmath114 and @xmath107 used for the experiment proposed in  @xcite , the high temperature limit holds . in computing the total cross section",
    ", the relevant contribution comes from those terms with @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "one obtains @xmath116 .",
    "this result has to be multiplied by a factor 2 , since there are two d atoms superimposed for each molecule , and also by a steric factor @xmath117 , which takes into account that each d atom does not collide with bath particles coming from all directions , due to the presence of the sulfur atoms ( see fig.[fig : d2s2col ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath118 and , according to eq .",
    "( [ tab : eq5 ] ) , @xmath119 .",
    "our result is in very good agreement with the one predicted by  @xcite .",
    "our approach to the tunneling properties of non - planar molecules in a gas offers a simple and general formula for computing the decoherence rate , and its dependence on the thermodynamic variables of the gas .",
    "it is flexible and applies to all situations where a molecule is immersed in a gas , which is the most common case , when tunneling properties are under study .",
    "the only three limitations are : the diluted - gas limit , the two - dimensional approximation and the high - temperature limit , which are satisfied in most physical conditions .",
    "the hard sphere limit represents the grossest type of approximation , but as we have seen its predictions are in excellent agreement with previous analyses . and",
    "it has the advantage of reducing a complex many - body problem to a simple geometric calculation .",
    "this opens the way to easy estimates of decoherence effects also for very complicated molecules in highly structure gases .    _",
