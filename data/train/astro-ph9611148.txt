    "a comparison of the mass - density distribution , as reconstructed from peculiar velocity data , with the light distribution ( i.e. , galaxies ) provides information on how well the mass traces light ( see chapter by dekel , and 1994 ) . the basic underlying relation between peculiar velocity and density",

    "no strong conclusion can therefore be reached at present regarding the values of @xmath277 or @xmath348 .",
    "the larger and more accurate surveys currently underway , including high precision velocity measurements , will likely lead to the determination of @xmath277 and possibly its decomposition into @xmath348 and @xmath206 ( e.g. , cole et al .",

    "clusters of galaxies can also serve as efficient tracers of the large - scale peculiar velocity field in the universe ( bahcall , gramann and cen 1994 ) . measurements of cluster peculiar velocities are likely to be more accurate than measurements of individual galaxies , since cluster distances can be determined by averaging a large number of cluster members as well as by using different distance indicators .",
    "using large - scale cosmological simulations , bahcall et al . ( 1994 ) find that clusters move reasonably fast in all the cosmological models studied , tracing well the underlying matter velocity field on large scales .",
