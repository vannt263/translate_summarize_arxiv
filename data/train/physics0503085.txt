    "the heider balance @xcite is a final state of personal relations between members of a society , reached when these relations evolve according to some dynamical rules .",
    "the relations are assumed to be symmetric , and they can be friendly or hostile . the underlying psycho - sociological mechanism of the rules is an attempt of the society members to remove a cognitive dissonance , which we feel when two of our friends hate each other or our friend likes our enemy . as a result of the process ,",
    "the society is split into two groups , with friendly relations within the groups and hostile relations between the groups . as a special case ,",
    "the size of one group is zero , i.e. all hostile relations are removed .",
    "hb is the final state if each member interacts with each other ; in the frames of the graph theory , where the problem is formulated , the case is represented by a fully connected graph .",
    "recently a continuous dynamics has been introduced to describe the time evolution of the relations @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the relations between nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1were represented by matrix elements @xmath2 , which were real numbers , friendly ( @xmath3 ) or hostile ( @xmath4 . as a consequence of the continuity , we observed a polarization of opinions : the absolute values of the matrix elements @xmath2 increase . here",
    "we continue this discussion , but the condition of maximal connectivity is relaxed , as it could be unrealistic in large societies .",
    "the purpose of first part of this work is to demonstrate , that even if hb is not present , the above mentioned polarization remains true . in section",
    "ii we present new numerical results for a society of @xmath5 members , represented by barabsi - albert ( ba ) network @xcite .",
    "although this size of considered social structure is rather small , it is sufficient to observe some characteristics which are different than those in the exponential networks . in second part ( section iii )",
    "we compare the results of our equations of motion with some examples , established in the literature of the subject .",
    "the section is closed by final conclusions .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath2 is determined by the equation of motion @xcite    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is a sociologically justified limitation on the absolute value of @xmath2 @xcite . here",
    "initial values of @xmath2 are random numbers , uniformly distributed in the range @xmath9 . the equation is solved numerically with the runge - kutta iv method with variable length of timestep @xcite , simultaneously for all pairs @xmath10 of linked nodes .",
    "the method of construction of ba networks was described in @xcite .",
    "the connectivity parameter is selected to be @xmath11 , because in this case the probability @xmath12 of hb has a clear minimum for ba networks of @xmath5 nodes , and @xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "this choice of @xmath14 is motivated by our aim to falsify the result on the polarization of opinions .",
    "this polarization was demonstrated @xcite to be a consequence of hb ; therefore , the question here is if it appears also when hb is not present .",
    "an example of time evolution of such a network is shown in fig .",
    "our result is that the polarization is present in all investigated cases . as time increases ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath2 gets wider and finally it reaches a stable shape , with two large peaks at @xmath15 and one smaller peak at the centre , where @xmath16 . in fig .",
    "3 , we show a series of histograms of @xmath17 in subsequent times ( a - e ) .",
    "particular networks differ quantitatively with respect to the heights of the peaks , but these differences are small .",
    "we note here that when some links are absent , the definition of hb should be somewhat relaxed , because some other links , which do not enter to any triad @xmath18 , will not evolve at all .",
    "therefore we should admit that some negative relations survive within a given group .",
    "we classify a final state of the graph as hb if there are no chains of friendly relations between the subgroups . on the other hand",
    ", more than two mutually hostile subgroups can appear .",
    "these facts were recognized already in literature @xcite .",
    "surprisingly enough , subgroups of @xmath19 nodes are never found in our ba networks . on the contrary , in the exponential networks groups of all sizes were detected . in figs .",
    "4 and 5 we show diagrams for ba networks and exponential networks , respectively .",
    "each point at these diagrams marks the value of @xmath2 and the size of the subgroup which contains nodes @xmath10 .",
    "links between different subgroups are omitted .",
    "we see that for ba networks ( fig.4 ) , the lowest value of @xmath20 is 97 .",
    "the remaining three nodes are linked with all other nodes by hostile relations .",
    "@xcite , an example of polarization of opinions on the lustration law in poland in 1999 was brought up .",
    "the presented statistical data @xcite displayed two maxima at negative and positive opinions and a lower value at the centre of the plot . in our simulations performed for fully connected graphs @xcite , the obtained value for the center was zero .",
    "however , it is clear that in any group larger than , say , 50 persons some interpersonal relations will be absent . taking this into account",
    ", we can claim than the statistical data of @xcite should be compared to the results discussed here rather than to those for a fully connected graph .",
    "here we reproduce a peak of the histogram at its centre , on the contrary to the results in @xcite .",
    "this fact allows to speak on a qualitative accordance of the results of our calculations with the statistical data of @xcite .",
    "next example is the set of data of the attendance of 18 southern women in local meetings in natchez , missouri , usa in 1935 @xcite .",
    "these data were used to compare 21 methods of finding social groups .",
    "the results were analysed with respect to their consensus , and ranked with consensus index from 0.543 ( much worse than all others ) to 0.968 . to apply our dynamics",
    ", we use the correlation function @xmath21 as initial values of @xmath2 .",
    "our method produced the division ( 1 - 9 ) against ( 10 - 18 ) , what gives the index value 0.968 .",
    "as a by - product , the method can provide the time dynamics of the relations till hb and , once hb is reached , the leadership within the cliques @xcite .",
    "we should add that actually , we have no data on the possible friendship or hostility between these women , then the interpretation of these results should be done with care .",
    "last example is the set of data about a real conflict in the zachary karate club @xcite .",
    "the input data are taken from @xcite .",
    "all initial values of the matrix elements are reduced by a constant @xmath22 to evade the case of overwhelming friendship .",
    "the obtained splitting of the group is exactly as observed by zachary : ( 1 - 8,11 - 14,17,18,20,22 ) against ( 9,10,15,16,19,21,23 - 34 ) .",
    "these results were checked not to vary for @xmath22 between 1.0 and 3.0 .",
    "the status of all group members can be obtained with the same method as in the previous example .    to conclude , the essence of eq .",
    "( 1 ) is the nonlinear coupling between links @xmath2 , which produces the positive feedback between the actual values of the relations and their time evolution .",
    "we should add that the idea of such a feedback is not entirely new .",
    "it is present , for example , in boltzmann - like nonlinear master equations applied to behavioral models @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", it is absent in later works on formal theory of social influence @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the theories of status @xcite are close to the method of transition matrix , known in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .    99 f. heider , j. of psychology * 21 * ( 1946 ) 107 .",
