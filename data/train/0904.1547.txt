    "coulomb s inverse square law for the force between two charges is one of the central features of classical electrodynamics .",
    "its experimental discovery by cavendish , coulomb , and robison was an important step in the development of classical electrodynamics culminating in maxwell s equations . over the last more than 200 years coulomb s law",
    "has been tested with increasing precision and at various length scales ( s. , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the first detected deviation from it in the form of the lamb shift was one of the first indications of `` new physics '' in the form of _ quantum _ electrodynamics  @xcite .    nowadays ,",
    "precise tests of coulomb s law can serve as a powerful probe to search for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "a classical application is the search for a photon mass ( s. , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "beyond that , tests of coulomb s law can even be used to search for new particles in so - called hidden sectors which interact only very weakly with the particles of the standard model and which are accordingly difficult to detect in conventional collider experiments .",
    "due to their feeble interactions constraints on hidden - sector particles are often quite weak and they may be light with masses in the ev - range or even below .",
    "hidden sectors appear in many extensions of the standard model .",
    "in fact , it may be exactly those hidden sectors that give us crucial information on how the standard model is embedded into a more fundamental theory as , e.g. , string theory .",
    "this makes it very desirable to have new , complementary probes of such particles .",
    "one example of a hidden sector particle that can be searched for in using tests of coulomb s law is massive extra u(1 ) gauge bosons  @xcite . in this note",
    "we will argue that they can also be used to search for another interesting class of hidden - sector particles , namely particles with a small electric charge , so - called minicharged particles ( s.  @xcite for a test via the lamb shift ) .",
    "minicharged particles ( mcps ) arise naturally and consistently in a wide variety of extensions of the standard model based on field  @xcite and string theory  @xcite .",
    "expectations for the size of their charge cover a wide range from @xmath0 to @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the best current laboratory limits in the sub - ev mass range are of the order of @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "[ bounds ] ) .",
    "astrophysical bounds ( s. , e.g. ,  @xcite ) are considerably stronger but also somewhat model dependent  @xcite from cosmology . ] .",
    "therefore , it is of particular importance to find new ways to search for minicharged particles in laboratory experiments . in this note",
    "we will show that cavendish type experiments searching for a deviation from coulomb s law can be used for this purpose .     whereas the red dashed curve gives a limit  @xcite from polarization experiments  @xcite@xmath3 and applies for a pure minicharged particle scenario .",
    "the shaded areas are excluded in both scenarios . ]",
    "minicharged particles cause a deviation from coulomb s law via their effect on the vacuum polarization in particular , via the uehling potential  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a non - vanishing vacuum polarization modifies the electric potential of a charge @xmath4 ( s. , e.g.  @xcite ) , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an on - shell renormalized version of the vacuum polarization , e.g. , @xmath7    for the vacuum polarization contribution of a particle of charge @xmath8 to the potential a standard textbook calculation  @xcite gives , @xmath9 . \\ ] ] for large distances , @xmath10 , @xmath11 drops off exponentially whereas for small distances , @xmath12 , it s behavior is logarithmic as expected from the running gauge coupling , @xmath13 \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad{\\rm for}\\quad mr\\gg 1 , \\\\\\nonumber \\!\\!&\\approx&\\!\\",
    "! \\frac{q\\alpha}{r}\\left[-\\frac{2\\alpha\\epsilon^2}{3\\pi}\\log(2mr)-a\\right ] , \\quad a\\approx\\frac{2\\alpha\\epsilon^2}{3\\pi}\\gamma \\quad\\quad\\,\\,\\,\\,{\\rm for}\\quad mr\\ll 1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so far we have considered the case where the minicharged particles have no further interactions . however , one of the most natural ways in which minicharges arise is via kinetic mixing  @xcite of the electromagnetic u(1 ) gauge boson with an extra `` hidden '' gauge boson under which the standard model particles are uncharged .",
    "for such a theory the lagrangian reads @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the field strength tensor for the ordinary electromagnetic u(1)@xmath16 gauge field @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the field strength for the hidden - sector u(1)@xmath19 field @xmath20 , _ i.e. _ , the hidden photon .",
    "the first two terms are the standard kinetic terms for the photon and hidden photon fields .",
    "because the field strength itself is gauge invariant for u(1 ) gauge fields , the third term is also allowed by gauge and lorentz symmetry .",
    "this term corresponds to a non - diagonal kinetic term , a so - called kinetic mixing . from the viewpoint of the low energy",
    "effective theory @xmath21 is a completely arbitrary parameter .",
    "typical expectation in extensions of the standard model range from @xmath0 to @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "accordingly we will treat @xmath21 in the following as a small parameter , @xmath22 .",
    "the kinetic term can be diagonalized by a shift @xmath23 the only effect on the visible sector field @xmath17 is a multiplicative change of the gauge coupling , @xmath24    we can now see how a minicharge arises for example for a hidden matter fermion @xmath25 that has charge one under @xmath20 . applying the shift   to the coupling term , we find : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the hidden - sector gauge coupling .",
    "we can read off that the hidden - sector particle now has a small electric charge @xmath28 under the visible electromagnetic gauge field @xmath17 which has gauge coupling @xmath29 .",
    "the interesting questions is now what is the effect of a vacuum polarization caused by the hidden sector particle @xmath25 , i.e. the minicharged particle .",
    "the vacuum polarization can be most easily calculated in the unshifted basis where @xmath25 couples only to the hidden sector field @xmath20 .",
    "accordingly its only effect is that the @xmath20 field has to be renormalized by a factor , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is given exactly by the same expression , eq .",
    ", as for @xmath32 only with @xmath33 replaced by the full hidden sector gauge coupling @xmath34 .",
    "this renormalization entails that @xmath21 , too , has to be renormalized , @xmath35 in turn , this then affects the renormalization eq .   of the ordinary electromagnetic gauge coupling after the diagnalization eq .",
    ", @xmath36 where we have treated @xmath31 as a small parameter and have used the relations eqs .  , to obtain the last equality .",
    "the right hand side is exactly the expression that appears in eq .  .",
    "accordingly , the vacuum polarization effects in theories with kinetic mixing cause the same . ] deviations from coulomb s law as in models with only minicharged particles .",
    "the bounds derived in the following are therefore independent of the specific way in which the minicharge arises .",
    "having identified the modification of the potential we can now turn to how it can be detected in experiments . currently , one of the most sensitive tests of the coulomb potential is a variation of the concentric sphere setup used by cavendish .",
    "the idea behind this experiment is that if and only if the potential has a @xmath37 form the inside of a charged sphere is field free and the potential accordingly constant . in other words ,",
    "the potential difference between a charged outer sphere and an uncharged inner sphere is zero if and only if the electric potential has the coulomb form .",
    "deviations from this form would lead to a non - vanishing potential difference that can be measured .",
    "in general , the potential of a sphere with a charge @xmath4 and a radius @xmath38 at the distance @xmath39 from the center of the sphere is @xmath40,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 it is straightforward to check that for a coulomb potential @xmath42 , the potential inside the sphere , i.e. for @xmath43 , is constant .",
    "explicitly one finds @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    in the simplest version of the cavendish experiment one",
    "has an outer sphere of radius @xmath46 , charged to a certain voltage , and then measures the relative voltage difference to the uncharged inner sphere of radius @xmath47 , @xmath48 on the right hand it is understood that @xmath49 is the part arising from the non - coulomb part @xmath11 .",
    "using eq .   for @xmath11 we can easily find ,",
    "@xmath50 inserting into we find , @xmath51 we expect the best bounds for small masses @xmath52 . in this limit",
    "we have , @xmath53 in this regime we therefore have , @xmath54 where we have assumed @xmath55 in the second line .",
    "in such a setup , plimpton and lawton  @xcite achieved already 1936 a sensitivity of the order @xmath56 .",
    "this corresponds to a bound of the order of @xmath57 .",
    "later experiments used a somewhat more complicated setup with several spheres .",
    "the latest and most precise  @xcite uses four spheres with radii @xmath58 .",
    "a very high voltage is applied between the outer two and the voltage difference is measured between the innermost pair .",
    "one can easily derive the appropriate expression for this case , @xmath59}{1+c\\left[\\delta u(c , c)+\\delta u(d , d)-2\\delta u(c , d)\\right]}\\right|,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 .",
    "for this quantity the experiment achieves a precision  @xcite , @xmath61 from our earlier discussion we expect @xmath62 for small masses . for larger masses @xmath63",
    "we expect a rapid weakening of the bound due to the exponential decay of the uehling potential ( cf .",
    "eq .  ) in this regime",
    ". the bound obtained from a numerical evaluation of eq .",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ bounds ] as the black area .",
    "we can see that for small masses this is the best laboratory bound that applies for minicharged particles with and without an additional massless hidden photon .",
    "in this note we have shown that tests of coulomb s law can be used to search for minicharged particles .",
    "minicharged particles leave their imprint on the potential between charges via their contribution to the vacuum polarization resulting in the uehling contribution to the potential .",
    "very precise laboratory limits on deviations from the coulomb potential arise from cavendish type experiments . using these",
    "we find a limit of @xmath64 in the mass range below @xmath65 ( cf . also fig .",
    "[ bounds ] ) . in this mass range",
    "this is the best laboratory bound for minicharged particles in theories where the minicharge arises from kinetic mixing .    as a final note we would like to point out that the cavendish experiments  @xcite we used to derive our bounds were performed nearly 40 years ago .",
    "one could hope that with current technology significant improvements are possible .",
    "therefore , precision tests of coulomb s law may yet again help us to explore the frontier of new physics .",
    "the author would like to thank markus ahlers , holger gies , javier redondo and andreas ringwald for helpful comments .",
