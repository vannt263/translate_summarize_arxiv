    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has proved to be a very successful theory , but still has problems . among these ,",
    "one that is considered fundamental is the vast difference between the electroweak and gravitational scales , known as the _ hierarchy problem _ , which might be solved introducing extra dimensions .",
    "the gravitational theory of einstein can be generalized in several ways , specially in higher dimensional spacetimes .",
    "one of the simplest generalizations is due to cartan , who proposed that the torsion does not necessarily vanishes.@xcite    cartan s extension of general relativity , can be naturally written in the first order formalism , using two independent kind of fields : ( a ) the vielbeins , which encode the information carried by the metric , and ( b ) the spin connection , which encipher the way the parallel transport is performed . however , in general the spin connection possesses an antisymmetric part , that is not present in the levi - civita one , which introduces torsion to the picture . in this formalism",
    ", gravity can be coupled to fermionic matter naturally .",
    "since the field equation for the spin connection is algebraic , it can be used to substitute the torsion in terms of the spin of fermion fields .",
    "the new action contains standard general relativity and matter fields with an additional contact four - fermion interaction.@xcite    in four dimensions , within the most straightforward torsional extension of einstein - hilbert gravity , the effective four - fermion interaction term has a coupling constant proportional to newton s gravitational constant , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the planck s mass ; although in the most general torsional generalization of einstein gravity , the effective four - fermion interaction term has a coupling constant proportional to a yet undetermined constant .",
    "therefore , at first glimpse this interaction is highly suppressed .",
    "nevertheless , in the last twenty years diverse scenarios have proposed that the existence of extra dimensions could solve the hierarchy problem , due to the introduction of a ( higher dimensional ) fundamental gravity scale of roughly @xmath5.@xcite recently , limits to the fundamental scale of gravity have been set up by direct searches of quantum black holes@xcite and the influence of the exchange of virtual gravitons on dilepton events@xcite .",
    "these might be compared with gravitational theories with torsion through their observables torsional observables@xcite , including some generalisations to higher dimensional spacetimes@xcite or lorentz violating models.@xcite    on the other hand , atlas and cms collaborations have presented experimental limits for the coupling constant of four - fermion contact interaction.@xcite adequately interpreted , these results are useful for imposing bounds on the value of the fundamental gravity scale , @xmath6 , in the context of theories with torsion . by extension , it is possible to find limits on the size of the eventual extra dimensions .",
    "the aim of this work is to obtain updated bounds and limits on the typical size of the extra dimensions using data coming from the lhc experiment .",
    "the paper is organised as follows , in sec .",
    "[ sec : cef ] , for the sake of completeness , a brief presentation of cartan s generalisation of gravity coupled with fermions is presented . in the next sections constraints",
    "are found for different higher dimensional scenarios , such as those proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali@xcite in sec .",

    "[ sec : res ] a summary of results and conclusions is presented .",
    "it is a well - known fact that einstein s gravity is a field theory for the metric , and the spacetime connection is required to be torsion - free ( see for example ref .  ) .",
    "interestingly , when the first order formalism of pure gravity is considered , _",
    "i.e. _ with all matter fields turned off , whose fields are the vielbeins and spin connection , the torsion - free imposition is nothing but the equation of motion for the spin connection.@xcite    however , for gravity coupled with fermionic matter , this condition changes and introduces a four - fermion contact interaction .",
    "the modification of the fermionic lagrangian due to the presence of torsion is presented below , using the notation in ref .  .",
    "the cartan - einstein action in @xmath7-dimensions is , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the vielbeins 1-form and curvature 2-forms respectively , and these are related with the spin connection 1-form , @xmath11 , and torsion 2-form , @xmath12 , , and @xmath13 . ] through the so called structural equations , @xmath14 additionally , the dirac action in arbitrary dimension is @xmath15 with @xmath16 the exterior derivative twisted by the spin connection , @xmath17 with @xmath18 the generators of the spinorial representation of the lorentz group .    since the total action is @xmath19 the equations of motion for the whole system are , s denote the anti - symmetric product of @xmath20-matrices . ]",

    "is a constraint , it can be substituted back into the action .",

    "the gravitational effects , other than the generation of a four - fermion interaction , are neglected .",
    "hereon , our objective will be to compare the four - fermion interaction coming from this gravity model with the four - fermion interaction limits found at the lhc experiments .",
    "early proposals of contact four - fermion interaction signals in colliders are found in @xcite .",
    "these works inspired searches at the lhc experiments .",
    "in particular , atlas and cms collaborations have found limits on the scale of four - fermion contact interaction , by analyzing the invariant mass and angular distribution of dijets@xcite . the strongest constraint comes from an interaction of chiral fermions in the form @xmath26 which is experimentally excluded for @xmath27 , assuming that the coupling constant @xmath28 .    in this section",
    "the above limit is compared with the four - fermion interaction coming from the cartan - einstein gravity action , , while the fermion in arbitrary dimension is denoted with the capitalized one , @xmath29 . ]",

    "therefore , in the following the spacetime will be considered to be @xmath37-dimensional , where the @xmath0 extra dimensions are either compact or extended , and differentiation between models is made according to this characteristic . in order to achieve the goal of comparison , it is necessary to reduce the dimension of the spacetime from @xmath7 down to four .",
    "although the dimensional reduction could be a complex procedure , we will sketch how a term like eq .   appears .",
    "first , in the contraction @xmath38 one splits the indices to consider the four - dimensional contribution,@xcite i.e. , @xmath39where the ellipsis stand for additional terms , but the focus will be on the first one , because it will rise the kind of interaction comparable with the experimental data .",
    "second , the antisymmetric product of three elements of the four - dimensional clifford algebra is equal to the product of the missing element of the clifford algebra times the chiral element , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "next , the higher dimensional spinor @xmath29 can be decomposed ( or compactified ) as the product of the four - dimensional times @xmath0-dimensional spinors,@xcite @xmath41 where the standard kaluza - klein decomposition for fermionic fields has been used , and @xmath42 ) . nonetheless , for the purpose of comparison with the term in eq .",
    "( where all spinors are left - handed ) , we restrict ourselves to the case of equal profiles . ]",
    "@xmath43 denotes the coordinates on the four - dimensional spacetime , @xmath44 denotes the extra dimensional coordinates , and also dirac spinors ( in four dimensions ) have been decomposed in terms of weyl spinors .",
    "therefore , after integration of the extra dimensions , the effective four - dimensional theory would have a term of the desired form @xmath45 dimensional analysis gives two possibilities .",
    "either the effective coupling constant is directly related to the fundamental gravitational scale , @xmath46 , or is related to the effective four - dimensional one @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the redefined planck mass after the dimensional reduction .",
    "these two interpretations originate different limits , which rise the bound limits presented below . in the following",
    ", the limits corresponding to the first interpretation will be called @xmath49 , while the limit given by the second interpretation will be called @xmath50      add models@xcite consist of a four - dimensional spacetime with a set of @xmath0 compact extra dimensions , with typical length @xmath51 .",
    "matter is confined to the four - dimensional spacetime for energies below @xmath52 , while gravity propagates through the whole spacetime .",
    "this configuration allows to solve the hierarchy problem , because the natural scale for gravity is not the effective four - dimensional one , but rather the @xmath37-dimensional .",
    "the relation between the fundamental gravitational scale , @xmath6 , and the four - dimensional effective one , @xmath4 is given by @xmath53 additionally , the coupling constant of the einstein action is @xmath54 .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that add scenarios are restricted to @xmath55 , because of gravitational phenomenology.@xcite    from eq .",
    ", it follows that the typical radii of the extra dimensions are @xmath56 assuming that the scale of the four - fermion interaction , @xmath57 , is essentially the fundamental scale of gravity , @xmath6 , one finds sizes of the extra dimensions from roughly a few micrometers down to a few tens femtometers , depending on the number of extra dimensions considered , as shown in the second column of table  [ tab : add - r ] .",
    "these results are a refinement of the original add claim .    on the other hand , the effective coupling constant in four dimensions , @xmath58 , should be related directly with the fundamental scale of gravity , i.e. , @xmath59 , or in a similar way as before @xmath60 hence , one finds another limit for the typical size of the extra dimensions , as shown on the third column of table  [ tab : add - r ] .",
    "when considering randall - sundrum brane - worlds scenarios,@xcite with metric @xmath61 the relation between the four - dimensional planck mass , @xmath4 , and the fundamental ( five - dimensional ) planck scale , @xmath6 , is given by @xmath62 a well - known modulus stabilization method would ensure that the product @xmath63@xcite , the relation between the gravitational scales and the length of the extra dimension is found to be @xmath64    analyzing both limits as in the previous section , the limit on the extra dimension size is @xmath65 the range is particularly wide because there is a single extra dimension .",
    "although brane - worlds of codimension higher than one have been considered@xcite , without a carefully thought - out moduli stabilization process the bounds on the extra dimensions sizes are equal to those found in sec .",
    "[ sec : add ] ( shown in table  [ tab : add - r ] ) .",
    "in this work we have used the limits on four - fermion chiral contact interactions obtained by the lhc collaborations in order to constrain the typical size of eventual extra dimensions in models where gravity admits torsion in the bulk .",
    "depending of the approach , there are two types of interpretations .",
    "these approaches , that we refer to as type a and type b , yield to constraints differ by at least two orders of magnitude . according to the table  [ tab : add - r ] , and the limits of eq .  , it is more likely to rule out the type b interpretation .    for a codimension 2",
    "we have found an upper bound for the radius of the extra dimensions of the order of @xmath66 , which is comparable to the limits obtained from direct search of the kaluza - klein excitations of the graviton@xcite . nevertheless , for higher numbers of extra dimensions we found that the constrains are a lot more stringent .",
    "this is due to the fact that the fundamental gravitational scale , @xmath6 , is related with the effective one , say @xmath48 , through higher powers , reducing the dependence of the model on the size of the extra dimensions .",
    "this result provides an example of the possibility of testing non - trivial extensions of general relativity using collider data .",
    "a refining of the analysis can be achieved by introducing different profile functions to left and right chiralities in eq .  , and performing the dimensional reduction analysis.@xcite    this model illustrates that in the context of extra dimensions , extensions of the gravitational sector might produce interesting effects in collider phenomenology .",
    "for example , even the physics underlying quark masses might have a gravitational origin in the bulk.@xcite moreover , the same type of contact interaction , generates corrections to very precisely measured electroweak observables , such as the @xmath67 decay , and their comparison to experimental values provide additional constraints on the scales of the effective coupling constant.@xcite additionally , the structure of the contact interactions and their universality allows a new contact interaction among neutrinos , which may be important in cosmological contexts .",
