    "the broad emission lines of high - redshift quasars are luminous enough to study physical properties of quasars such as central black hole mass , accretion rate and metallicity of broad emission line regions in the early universe .",
    "recent optical observations of emission lines such as c and n reveal supersolar abundances in quasar broad emission line regions even at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the lack of evolution of the fe / mg uv emission line ratio of quasars apparently continues out to @xmath3=6.4 @xcite .",
    "the rest - frame optical fe emission as well as hydrogen balmer emission lines in high - redshift quasars can not be measured from the ground facilities .",
    "these measurements can be pursued with the akari @xcite which has a unique capability to take near - infrared spectra in @xmath4  from the space as well as mid - infrared ( 5 - 14 , 18 - 26 ) with the infrared camera ( irc ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore one can trace the redshifted emission lines toward the high - redshift universe with the akari .",
    "a quasar , rx j1759.4 + 6638 , at a redshift of 4.320 was discovered as the most distant rosat x - ray selected object known at the time by @xcite near the north ecliptic pole ( nep ) . in this paper , we report the near - infrared spectroscopy of this quasar and the detection of an h@xmath0 emission line at @xmath5 .",
    "previous studies @xcite performed the measurements of the h@xmath0 emission line in high - redshift quasars in the near - infrared spectroscopy and the redshifts of their sample only reached @xmath6 because the wavelength of redshifted h@xmath0 emission lines is affected by strong thermal emission of a telescope .",
    "therefore this is the first spectroscopic detection of an h@xmath0 emission line in a quasar beyond z=4 , while h@xmath0 detections in photometric observations are reported by @xcite for quasars at z@xmath7 by using the spitzer irac .",
    "our spectroscopic detection is caused by a benefit of high sensitivity spectroscopy with a cooled telescope from the space .    through this paper ,",
    "we adopt a flat cosmology with @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "rx j1759.4 + 6638 was observed by the akari irc on 2006 april , may , october and 2007 february .",
    "as summarized in table [ tab : tab1 ] , we made six pointed observations using the irc spectroscopic mode aot04 .",
    "there are three observing modes : np , ng , and npng modes .",
    "the np mode uses the near - infrared prism with spectral resolving power @xmath11 @xmath12 19 at 3.5@xmath13 m . in this mode , a target",
    "is put on the imaging area of near - infrared detector . in the np mode , a mir - s spectroscopic observation of a target is performed simultaneously . the ng",
    "mode uses the near - infrared grism ( @xmath14 120 at 3.6@xmath13 m ) , in which a target is put on a small aperture for a point source grism spectroscopy .",
    "the other , npng , is a special observing mode for a calibration using the prism and the grism in the first half observation and the second , respectively .",
    "the first four observations with the npng mode were done for the wavelength calibration using the planetary nebula ngc 6543 in the performance verification phase . during these observations ,",
    "the spectra of rx j1759.4 + 6638 were obtained serendipitously .",
    "the remaining observations were targeted observations for this quasar using the akari director time in order to confirm the serendipitous detections in the performance verification phase .",

    "np +    the data were processed through the irc spectroscopic toolkit @xcite to produce calibrated data frames .",
    "the data were converted into dark - subtracted , linearity corrected and flat - field corrected frames after data that had strong cosmic rays on the target object were removed with visual investigation .",
    "multiple frames were combined , and one - dimensional background - subtracted spectra of the target quasar were extracted from the combined data with the aperture width of 3 pixels ( 4.5 in the nir ) .",
    "the resultant spectra were scaled by a factor of 1.6 for the aperture correction .",
    "in addition to the error estimation by the irc spectroscopic toolkit using the sky variation near a target , we also calculated the root mean square of signal between each frames .",
    "the original error estimation was recognized to be overestimated due to the contamination of other sources and the variations of signals between each frame were used as the background error of spectra here .",
    "the photometric calibration of the spectrum was based on akari irc observations of standard stars , while the wavelength calibration was based on observations of emission line stars and planetary nebulae @xcite . at this time",
    "we estimate that the overall uncertainty in the wavelength calibration is @xmath16 m at 3.5@xmath13 m .",
    "the series of pv phase observations ( i d 5020047.1 , 5020048.1 , 5020049.1 and 5020050.1 ) detected the h@xmath0 emission line only tentatively because the contamination of a faint near - infrared source affected positions of the h@xmath0 emission line . the targeted np observation ( i d 5124044.1 ) was arranged after we checked that the dispersion direction was free from any other object using the deep n3-band image of the akari north ecliptic pole ( nep ) survey ( figure [ fig : fig1 ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ng spectroscopy ( i d 5124035.1 ) and all mir - s data , which were taken simultaneously during np observations , provided spectra with low signal - to - noise ratio only .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] presents the resultant observed spectrum of the np observation on the top panel with a black thick line . on the spectrum , there are two features ; a bump at the wavelength of 3.47  and a dip on the shorter wavelength side of the bump .",
    "the bump is located at the h@xmath0 emission line corresponding to @xmath3=4.29 . for the check of their reliabilities",
    ", we divided their data in half and reduced them separately . on the top panel of figure [ fig : fig2 ] , two spectra of first and second half data",
    "are also shown in blue and red lines , respectively .",
    "both the dip and the bump are shown in both data sets .",
    "in addition , we also checked that the response function of the np prism did not produce these features as shown on the bottom panel of figure [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "thus both features , the bump and the dip , are real .",
    "the other possible explanation of the bump is the contamination of other sources .",
    "however , as mentioned above , we arranged the np observation when the dispersion direction was free from any other objects .",
    "there is no contamination in the dispersion direction as shown in figure [ fig : fig1 ] , and therefore we conclude that the detection of the h@xmath0 emission line is reliable .",
    "to determine the wavelength center and the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) , we fit a gaussian function to this spectrum after smoothing the spectrum with 3 pixels ( figure [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "the detail measurements of the h@xmath0 emission line are summarized in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "the redshift from the h@xmath0 emission line is found to be @xmath17 , in agreement with the previous measurements of redshifts , @xmath3=4.320 @xcite and 4.32 @xcite by using restframe - ultraviolet emission lines from the ground - base optical spectroscopy .",
    "the h@xmath0 line flux is @xmath18 , corresponding to the luminosity of h@xmath0 emission line @xmath19 at @xmath3=4.3 .",
    "while the h@xmath0 emission line flux is affected by two [ n ] lines located at blue and red side of the h@xmath0 line , their contribution of [ n ] emission lines to the h@xmath0 line flux is only 3 percents in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) composite @xcite and is ignored in this paper .",
    "the fwhm of the h@xmath0 emission line is found to be unresolved and @xmath20 which is comparable to the instrumental resolution @xmath21 when we made the 3-pixel smoothing data .",
    "the restframe equivalent width ( ew ) of the h@xmath0 emission line is 0.071@xmath220.015 @xmath13 m which is converted from the observed ew of 0.38@xmath220.08 @xmath13 m at @xmath3=4.3 .",
    "however there is a dip of the continuum around 3.2@xmath23 in figure [ fig : fig2 ] and the dip makes it difficult to measure the h@xmath0 line flux and the ew accurately . this dip might be a broad absorption line feature , while there are no features of broad absorption lines in the restframe uv spectra@xcite .",
    "thus the reason of this dip is still uncertain .",
    "we also measured the nir and mir - s photometric fluxes of this quasar with the irc during the course of the akari nep - deep survey @xcite .",
    "the results of the nir and mir - s bands are summarized in table [ tab : tab3 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3 ] presents the comparison of the irc spectrum of rx j17759.4 + 6638 with irc photometric result as well as the median spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of low - redshift quasars @xcite . assuming that the n3-band flux includes the h@xmath0 emission line flux and the n2- and n4-bands represent continuum level",
    ", the flux of the h@xmath0 emission line , @xmath24 , from the photometric data agrees with the spectroscopic measurement of the h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "the uncertainty of the line flux from the photometric data is dominated by the systematic errors of photometric calibration .",
    "the observed fluxes of emission lines and continuum level are consistent with the photometric study within their uncertainties .",
    "comparing our measurements with the median sed of low - redshift quasars @xcite , rx j1759.4 + 6638 has quite typical spectral energy distribution , which suggests no significant evolution in the rest - frame optical- and near - infrared wavelengths .",

    "the ly@xmath0 line flux from @xcite changed into less than half of the measurements in @xcite on a timescale of about 1 yr ( rest frame ) suggesting that this quasar is variable .",

    "in addition , the line profile of ly@xmath0 is strongly affected by the intervening column of intergalactic neutral hydrogen @xcite .",
