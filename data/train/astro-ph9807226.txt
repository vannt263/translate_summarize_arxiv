    "supersoft x - ray sources are believed to be accreting white dwarfs burning material on their surface ( van den heuvel et al .",

    "quasi - stable h burning requires high mass transfer rates ( @xmath2 @xmath3 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 yr@xmath1 , iben @xcite ) . such high transfer rates which are at least a factor 10 higher than those occurring in cataclysmic variables may be achieved by thermally unstable roche lobe overflow when the mass donor star is more massive than the accreting object .",
    "steady thermonuclear burning allows the white dwarf to increase its mass since processed material can remain at the surface of the accreting object .",
    "a large fraction of snia could originate in such systems when the white dwarf mass approaches the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "a recent review of these systems can be found in kahabka & van den heuvel ( @xcite ) .    and",

    "because of the large interstellar absorption , only the very high energy part ( e @xmath6 0.5kev ) of the intrinsically soft energy distribution is offered to observation .",
    "the resulting x - ray spectrum peaks at 0.8kev and is unique among supersoft sources ( hartmann & heise @xcite ) . optical photometric and spectroscopic observations suggest an orbital period of @xmath3 3.8d ( motch @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of bipolar jets with velocities in the range of 1,000 - 4,000 km s@xmath1 has been recently reported in two supersoft sources , (: crampton et al .",

    "we report on the discovery of a well formed bipolar outflow with a projected velocity of @xmath3 5,200 km s@xmath1 in .",
    "was observed during two consecutive nights on 1997 june 7 and 8 ut with the eso - danish 1.54 m telescope and dfosc equipped with the loral - lesser 2k3eb - c1w7 chip .",
    "all spectra have 15mn exposure times and on all occasions we used grism # 7 with a slit width of 2.5  in order to accommodate the rather bad seeing ( @xmath3 2 ) prevailing during the entire run .",
    "in addition to these spectroscopic data , several 2mn long v band exposures were accumulated over the two nights . during the first night",
    ", 3 spectra were obtained in about 1 hour from jd start times 2,450,606.5499 to 2,450,606.5821 .",
    "the 5 spectra collected during the second night span 2.8 hours from jd 2,450,607.4666 to 2,450,607.5823 .",
    "all data were reduced using standard midas procedures .",
    "two dimensional spectra were calibrated in wavelength using he+ne arc lamps exposures closest in time to the science frame .",
    "a s / n optimized procedure extracted one dimensional spectra .",
    "the spectral range extends from 3,800 to 6,900  with a pixel size of 1.47 .",
    "spectral resolution is degraded by the large slit width and bad seeing .",
    "fwhm resolution estimated from the minimum observed width of h@xmath0  is about 7.3 .    in fig .",
    "[ meanspectra ] we plot the average of the three june 7 spectra exhibiting the jet feature together with the average of the five june 8 spectra which are typical of the normal state of the source .",
    "the redshifted h@xmath0component unfortunately coincides in wavelength with the @xmath76678.15 and @xmath76683.2 emission lines .",
    "no jet feature is seen at @xmath74686 which is the second brightest emission line in the observed wavelength range . using h@xmath0  jet lines as template",
    ", we can put an upper limit of 2.4  to the equivalent width ( ew ) of the blue component .",
    "average spectra of both nights show evidence for p cyg profile in the central h@xmath0  emission .",
    "[ jetspectra ] shows that the jet velocity does not change on a time scale of one hour . within the statistical uncertainties ,",
    "the jet profile remains constant , showing a clear asymmetric extension towards low absolute velocities . during the first night , the central h@xmath0  line exhibits shoulders moving in velocity from one spectrum to the other ( @xmath3 20mn ) .",
    "such variations are not seen during the following night .",
    "we tried to correct the red jet component profile for contaminating and lines by subtracting the mean june 8 spectrum shifted by the 44 kms@xmath1 velocity difference . in the wavelength intervals void of sharp line features ( i.e. excluding the h@xmath0  and / lines )",
    ", we smoothed the june 8 continuum with a gaussian of 7.3  fwhm , equal to the spectral resolution .",
    "this procedure preserves the best statistics and allows correction for weak water vapour absorption bands which are abundant bluewards of h@xmath0 .",
    "the resulting pure jet spectrum is shown on fig .",
    "[ jetonly ] .",
    "peak intensities of both components compare remarkably well . after correction , the slight asymmetry of the raw red component profile ( see fig .",
    "[ jetspectra ] ) seems to have vanished .",
    "this could be due to changing / line emission strength between the first and the second night .",
    "independently of any correction error due to / lines , the red and blue component profiles appear to have different widths , the red profile being about 8(360kms@xmath1 ) less extended towards low absolute velocities than the blue one .",
    "the ew of the blue component is 4.1 , slightly larger than those of ( 3 , becker et al .",
    "@xcite ) and rxj0513.9 - 6951 ( 2.6 , southwell et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in contrast , the ew of the central h@xmath0   ( 4.9 ) and @xmath84686  ( 7.8 ) lines in  are significantly smaller than those of other supersoft sources exhibiting jets .",
    "the upper limit on the @xmath84686  to h@xmath0  ew ratio for blueshifted components ( @xmath3 0.6 ) is compatible with those observed in other sources and does not suggest a lower excitation level in the jet of    the v magnitude of  was 17.213@xmath90.016 and 17.133@xmath90.026 on june 7 and 8 ut respectively .",
    "these magnitudes are within the range of those reported for the source since 1992 ( motch et al .",
    "@xcite ; motch @xcite ) and there is therefore no evidence that the appearance of the jet is accompanied by any large change in optical continuum emission .",
    "the detailed shape of the shifted h@xmath0  lines , in particular their extended wings towards small absolute velocities potentially contains valuable information on jet geometry and kinematics .",
    "we therefore designed a simple kinematic jet model derived from that used by becker et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the jet is described as a cone of half opening angle @xmath10 in which all atoms move with velocity @xmath11 . within the cone",
    ", material is assumed to be flowing uniformly per unit solid angle . in order to compute line profiles we further assumed that the outflow emission region is optically thin and convolved the model profile with a gaussian of fwhm = 333kms@xmath1 ( @xmath12 = 142kms@xmath1 ) representing the instrumental profile .",
    "since we only have a snapshot observation at an unknown orbital phase , we can not constrain the orientation of the jet with respect to orbital plane or with respect to the axis joining the two stars . in our case ,",
    "the only relevant angles are @xmath10 and the angle @xmath13 between the line of sight and the jet axis . in this simplified geometry ,",
    "the jet axis is aligned with the @xmath14 axis and the line of sight is contained in the @xmath15-@xmath14 plane . a flow making an angle @xmath16 with respect to jet axis and an angle @xmath17 with respect to the @xmath15 axis",
    "will have a projected component @xmath18 on the line of sight .",
    "the jet components extend in velocity from about 3,800 to 5,800kms@xmath1 with a peak at 5,200kms@xmath1 .",
    "any effect related to orbital motion is likely to be negligible since the k amplitude of the line is only @xmath380kms@xmath1 ( motch @xcite ) and since the duration of the observation ( @xmath3 1h ) is small with respect to the suspected orbital period ( p@xmath19 @xmath3 3.8d ) .",
    "considering the uncertainties resulting from the / line contamination , we did not try to fit a model jet profile to the redshifted h@xmath0component .",
    "the width of the blue component profile and its asymmetry , namely its larger extension towards low absolute velocities , can be accurately represented by a well opened jet seen at rather low inclination . as shown on fig .",
    "[ figfit ] , the fit is surprisingly good considering the simplicity of the model ( @xmath20 = 38.1 ) . at the 99% confidence level , the formal accepted ranges of inclinations @xmath13 are 7  to 13  and 20  to 29   and those of half - opening jet angles @xmath10 are 17  to 27  and 34  to 41 .",
    "large inclination angles correspond to small jet opening angles .",
    "the range of @xmath10 values compares well with that derived for  by becker et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . in the framework of this simple model",
    "the difference in profile shape between the blue and red components could reflect different opening angles ( assuming inclinations are identical ) .    alternatively , the width and asymmetry of the blueshifted profile could be due to an intrinsic spread of material velocity in the outflow .",
    "this would allow much narrower opening angles , more consistent with the conception of a jet .",
    "in this picture , the difference in profile shape and extent between the blue and red components may be for instance interpreted in terms of occultation of the low velocity part of an accelerating jet by the accretion disc .",
    "finally , line profiles may also be intrinsically broadened by keplerian velocity in the inner parts of the accretion disc ( becker et al .",
    "is the third supersoft source in which collimated outflows are observed demonstrating that jets are common phenomena in this class of high mass transfer rate accreting binaries .",
    "however , compared to other supersoft sources , the jet of  appears to be a rather rare and rapidly variable phenomenon .",
    "the jet was detected during only one among 23 nights of observation performed since the identification of the source in 1992 , and it disappeared in less than 24h . for comparison ,",
    "the jet of rxj0513.9 - 6951 is almost constantly seen at about the same velocity .",
    "crampton et al .",
    "( @xcite ) report non - detection during only one or two nights . on the other hand ,",
    "the jet of  is transient on time scales of months ( becker et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the observation of a jet with a projected velocity of @xmath3 5,200kms@xmath1 confirms that  belongs to the class of supersoft sources in spite of its unusual x - ray spectrum .",
    "in particular , if the jet velocity is of the order of the escape velocity from the central object ( see e.g. , livio @xcite ) then the m / r ratio of the source is similar to that of a white dwarf .",
    "wind velocities of the order of 6,000kms@xmath1 are indeed observed in some cataclysmic variables ( drew @xcite )    fits of nlte model atmospheres to asca data ( ebisawa et al .",
    "@xcite ) and rosat pspc data ( hartmann & heise @xcite ) indicate high effective temperatures close to 70ev and amazingly small source radii in the range of 160 - 370(@xmath21/1kpc)km .",
    "the reduced emitting area has been sometimes considered as evidence that the source was in fact a neutron star with an extended atmosphere ( hartmann & heise @xcite , kylafis & xilouris @xcite ) .",
    "if the jet originates from the close surrounding of the x - ray emitting surface then the source radius is of the order of 10@xmath22 cm for solar masses objects , independently of the actual nature of the central engine , white - dwarf or shrouded neutron star .",
    "from this point of view ,  does not look different from other supersoft sources and its distance should be at least 10kpc in order for the x - ray emitting region to reach a radius similar to that of the jet producing region . at 10kpc ,",
    "the bolometric luminosity is 5 10@xmath23 erg s@xmath1   and the radius of the source is at most 3,700 km suggesting a very massive white dwarf .",
    "however , as the bulk of the energy distribution of  is masked by photoelectric absorption , it is still possible that spectral fits give somewhat biased source parameters .",
    "optical data do not rule out such large distances .",
    "the interstellar absorption towards the source ( n@xmath24  @xmath3 1.3 10@xmath25 @xmath26 , motch et al .",
    "@xcite ) is similar to the integrated galactic value while a large part of the reddening probably takes place rather locally in the vela sheet molecular cloud located at 425pc . at 10kpc",
    ", the intrinsic v magnitude of  is m@xmath27 = @xmath284 , two magnitudes brighter than the brightest of the magellanic supersoft sources , rxj0513.9 - 6951 .",
    "this high optical luminosity could reflect the long orbital period and large accretion disc of . in supersoft sources ,",
    "the white dwarf luminosity due to nuclear burning is much larger than the total accretion luminosity of the disc and x - ray reprocessing in the disc and on the secondary atmosphere should play an important role ( see e.g. popham & distefano @xcite ) . if as for low - mass x - ray binaries m@xmath27 scales as 1.67@xmath29log(p@xmath19 )",
    "( van paradijs and mcclintock @xcite ) , then the larger orbital period and accretion disc in  may already explain a 1.2 magnitude difference .",
    "different disc rim structures ( meyer - hofmeister et al .",
    "@xcite ) and uncertainties on a@xmath27 could account for the rest of the difference in absolute magnitude between  and rxj0513.9 - 6951 .",
    "in addition , a large visual flux emission from the x - ray heated structures of the binary would explain the absence of detectable late type features in the optical spectrum . in a @xmath3 3.8d orbit",
    ", the roche lobe filling evolved star is expected to have m@xmath27 @xmath3 0 ( motch @xcite ) .    for stable shell burning",
    ", the nuclear luminosity mainly depends on the mass of the burning envelope and is thus insensitive to short time scale changes in mass accretion rate ( fujimoto @xcite ) . only for the most massive white dwarfs which undergo high accretion rates and retain light envelopes",
    "can the nuclear luminosity vary significantly on a time scale of a week .",
    "if the appearance of the jet is due to a sudden increase of the mass accretion rate onto the white dwarf , only the much weaker accretion luminosity may vary on short time scales .",
    "therefore , no large and fast change in bolometric nor optical luminosity is expected to accompany the jet , in agreement with the v band photometry .",
    "jet inclinations larger than @xmath3 60  seem unlikely as they would imply outflow velocities in excess of the escape velocity of the most massive white dwarfs ( @xmath30 11,000kms@xmath1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the velocity dispersion is mainly of geometric origin then the shape of the h@xmath0  blue component profile implies @xmath13 @xmath31 29 . since the jet is likely to be emitted perpendicularly to the plane of the accretion disc ( becker et al .",
    "@xcite ) it is probable that  is seen at low inclination angles , consistent with the lack of detected x - ray eclipses . as for  ( becker et al .",
    "@xcite ) , such low inclinations may be incompatible with the relatively large amplitude of the photometric light curve .",
    "however , possible jet precession in  does not allow to draw definite conclusions ."
