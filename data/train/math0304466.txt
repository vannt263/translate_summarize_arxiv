    "-5 mm    the constantly intensifying ties between combinatorics and geometry are among the most significant developments in discrete mathematics in recent years .",
    "these connections are manifold , and it is , perhaps , still too early to fully evaluate this relationship .",
    "this article deals only with what might be called _ the geometrization of combinatorics_. namely , the idea that viewing combinatorial objects from a geometric perspective often yields unexpected insights . even more concretely",
    ", we concentrate on finite metric spaces and their embeddings .    to illustrate the underlying idea , it may be best to begin with a practical problem .",
    "there are many disciplines , scientific , technological , economic and others , which crucially depend on the analysis of large bodies of data .",
    "technological advances have made it possible to collect enormous amounts of interesting data , and further progress depends on our ability to organize and classify these data so as to allow meaningful and insightful analysis .",
    "a case in point is bioinformatics where huge bodies of data - dna sequences , protein sequences , information about expression levels etc .",
    "all await analysis .",
    "let us consider , for example , the space of all proteins .",
    "for the purpose of the current discussion , a protein may be viewed as a word in an alphabet of 20 letters ( amino acids ) .",
    "word lengths vary from under fifty to several thousands , the most typical length being several hundred letters . at this writing , there are about half a million proteins whose sequence is known .",
    "algorithms were developed over the years to evaluate the similarity of different proteins , and there are standard computer programs that calculate distances among proteins very efficiently .",
    "this turns the collection of all known proteins into a metric space of about half a million elements .",
    "proper analysis of this space is of great importance for the biological sciences .",
    "thus , this huge body of sequence data takes a geometric form , namely , a finite metric space , and it becomes feasible to use geometric concepts and tools in the analysis of this data .    in the combinatorial realm",
    "proper , and in the design and analysis of algorithms , similar ideas have proved very useful as well .",
    "a graph is completely characterized by its ( shortest path , or geodesic ) metric .",
    "the analysis of this metric provides a lot of useful information about the graph .",
    "moreover , given a graph @xmath0 , one may modify @xmath0 s metric by assigning nonnegative _ lengths _ to @xmath0 s edges . by varying these edge lengths ,",
    "a family of finite metrics is obtained , the properties of which reflect a good deal of structural information about @xmath0 .",
    "we mention in passing that there are other useful and interesting geometric viewpoints of graphs .",
    "thus , it is useful to geometrically realize a graph by assigning vectors to the vertices and posit that adjacent vertices correspond to orthogonal vectors",
    ". graphs can encode the intersection patterns of geometric objects .",
    "these are all interesting instances of our basic paradigm : in the study of combinatorial objects , and especially graphs , it is often beneficial to develop a perspective from which the graph is perceived geometrically .    aside from what has already been thus accomplished , this approach holds a great promise .",
    "combinatorics as we know it , is still a very young subject .",
    "( there is no official date of birth , and euler was undoubtedly a giant in our field , but i think that the dawn of modern combinatorics can be dated to the 1930 s ) . discrete mathematics stands to gain a lot from interactions with older , better established fields .",
    "this geometrization of combinatorics indeed creates clear and tangible connections with various subfields of geometry .",
    "so far the study of finite metric spaces has had substantial connections with the theory of finite - dimensional normed spaces , but it seems safe to predict that useful ties with differential geometry will soon emerge . with the possible incorporation of probabilistic tools , now commonplace in combinatorics , we can expect very exciting outcomes .",
    "a good sign for the vitality of this area is the large number of intriguing open problems .",
    "we will present here some of those that we particularly like . in a recent meeting ( haifa , march 02 ) ,",
    "a list of open problems in this area has been collected , see http://www.kam.mff.cuni.cz/@xmath1matousek/haifaop.ps .",
    "more extensive surveys of this area can be found in  @xcite chapter 15 , and  @xcite .    in view of this description , it should not come as a surprise to the reader that this theory is characterized as being    * _ asymptotic : _ we are mostly interested in analyzing large , finite metric spaces , graphs and data sets . *",
    "_ approximate : _ while it is possible to postulate that the geometric situation agrees perfectly with the combinatorics , it is much more beneficial to investigate the approximate version .",
    "this leads to a richer theory that is quantitative in nature . rather than a binary question whether perfect mimicking is possible or",
    "not , we ask _ how well _ a given combinatorial object can be approximated geometrically . *",
    "_ algorithmic : _ existential results are very important and interesting in this area , but we always prefer it when such a result is accompanied by an efficient algorithm . * it is mostly _ comparative : _ there are certain classes of finite metric spaces that we favor .",
    "these may have a particularly simple structure or be very well understood .",
    "other , less well behaved spaces are being compared to , and approximated by , these  nice \" metrics .",
    "so , how should we compare between two metrics ?",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 be two metric spaces and let @xmath4 be a mapping between them .",
    "we quantify the extent to which @xmath5 expands , resp .",
    "contracts distances : @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    finally , the main definition is : @xmath8 .    in other words , we consider the tightest constants @xmath9 for which @xmath10 always holds , and define @xmath11 as @xmath12 .",
    "we call @xmath5 an _ isometry _ when @xmath13 .",
    "this deviates somewhat from the conventional definition , and a map that multiplies all distances by a constant ( not necessarily @xmath14 ) is being considered here as an isometry .",
    "the least distortion with which @xmath2 can be embedded in @xmath3 is denoted @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath16 is a class of metric spaces , then the infimum of @xmath17 over all @xmath18 is denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath16 is the class of finite - dimensional @xmath20 spaces @xmath21 we denote @xmath19 by @xmath22 .",
    "one of the * major problems * in this area is :    given a finite metric space @xmath2 and a class of metrics @xmath16 , find the ( nearly ) best approximation for @xmath23 by a metric from @xmath16 . in other words , find a metric space @xmath24 and a map @xmath4 such that @xmath11 ( nearly ) equals @xmath19 .",
    "the classes of metric spaces @xmath16 for which this problem has so far been studied are : ( i ) metrics of normed spaces , especially @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "( ii ) metrics of special families of graphs , most notably trees , as well as convex combinations thereof .",
    "one more convention : speaking of @xmath20 , either means infinite dimensional @xmath20 , or , what is often the same , that we do not care about the dimension of the space in which we embed a given metric .    to get a first feeling for this subject ,",
    "let us consider the smallest nontrivial example .",
    "every @xmath28-point metric embeds isometrically into the plane , but as we show now , the metric of @xmath29 , the @xmath30-vertex tree with a root and three leaves , has no isometric embedding into @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath32 , resp .",
    "@xmath33 be the image of the root and the leaves of this tree .",
    "since @xmath34 and @xmath35 for all @xmath36 , it follows that the three points @xmath37 are colinear for every @xmath36 .",
    "thus , all four points are colinear , leading to a contradiction .",
    "it can be shown that the least distorted image of this graph in @xmath31 is in the plane with @xmath38 degree angle among the edges .",
    "below ( section  [ sec_l2 ] ) we present a polynomial - time algorithm that determines @xmath39 , the least @xmath31 distortion for any finite metric @xmath2 .",
    "another easy fact which belongs into this warm - up section is that @xmath40 for every finite metric @xmath2 .",
    "that is , the space @xmath41 space contains an isometric copy of every finite metric space .",
    "+ * acknowledgment : * helpful remarks on this article by r. krauthgamer , a. magen , j. matouek , and yu .",
    "rabinovich are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "-5 mm    this is by far the most developed part of the theory .",
    "there are several good reasons for this part of the theory to have attracted the most attention so far .",
    "consider the practical context , where a metric space represents some large data set , and where the major driving force is the search for good algorithms for data analysis .",
    "if the data set you need to analyze happens to be a large set of points in @xmath31 , there are many tools at your disposal , from geometry , algebra and analysis .",
    "so if your data can be well approximated in @xmath31 , this is of great practical advantage .",
    "there is another reason for the special status of @xmath31 in this area . to explain it , we need to introduce some terminology from banach space theory .",
    "the _ banach - mazur distance _ among two normed spaces @xmath23 and @xmath42 , is said to be @xmath43 , if there is a _ linear _",
    "map @xmath4 with @xmath44 . what we are doing here may very well be described as a search for the metric counterpart of this highly developed linear theory .",
    "see  @xcite for an introduction to this field and  @xcite for a comprehensive cover of the nonlinear theory .",
    "the grandfather of the linear theory is the celebrated theorem of dvoretzky  @xcite .",
    "[ dvoretzky ] for every @xmath45 and @xmath46 , every @xmath45-dimensional normed space contains a @xmath47-dimensional space whose banach - mazur distance from @xmath31 is @xmath48 .",
    "thus , among embeddings into normed spaces , embeddings into @xmath31 are the hardest to come by .",
    "we begin our story with an important theorem of bourgain  @xcite .",
    "[ bour_thm ] every @xmath45-point metric space , the cardinality of the metric space in question . ] embeds in @xmath31 with distortion @xmath49 .",
    "not only is this a fundamental result , bourgain s proof of the theorem readily translates into an efficient randomized algorithm that finds , for any given finite @xmath2 an embedding in @xmath31 of distortion @xmath49 .",
    "the algorithm is so simple that we record it here . given the metric space @xmath2 , we map every point @xmath50 to @xmath51 , an @xmath52-dimensional vector",
    ". coordinates in @xmath53 correspond to subsets @xmath54 , and the @xmath55-th coordinate in @xmath51 is simply @xmath56 , the minimum of @xmath57 over all @xmath58 . to define the map @xmath5",
    ", we need to specify , then , the collection of subsets @xmath55 that we utilize .",
    "these sets are selected randomly .",
    "namely , you randomly select @xmath59 sets of size @xmath14 , another @xmath59 sets of size @xmath60 , of size @xmath61 .    in view of bourgain s theorem ,",
    "several questions suggest themselves naturally :    * is this bound tight ?",
    "the answer is positive , see theorem  [ expander ] . * given that @xmath62 over all @xmath45-point metrics is @xmath63 , what about metrics that are closer to @xmath31 ?",
    "is there a polynomial - time algorithm to compute @xmath64 ( that is , the least distortion in an embedding of @xmath23 into @xmath31 ) ?",
    "again the answer is affirmative , see below and theorem  [ sdp ] .",
    "* are there interesting families of metric spaces for which @xmath65 is substantially smaller than @xmath66 ?",
    "indeed , there are , see , e.g. , theorem  [ tree ] .",
    "so let us proceed with the answers to these questions .",
    "_ expanders _ are graphs which can not be disconnected into two large subgraphs by removing relatively few edges .",
    "specifically , a graph @xmath0 on @xmath45 vertices is said to be an @xmath67-_(edge)-expander _ if , for every set @xmath55 of @xmath68 vertices , there are at least @xmath69 edges between @xmath55 and its complement .",
    "it is said to be @xmath70-_regular _ if every vertex has exactly @xmath70 neighbors .",
    "the theory of expander graphs is a fascinating chapter in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science .",
    "it is not obvious that arbitrarily large @xmath70-regular graphs exist with expansion @xmath67 bounded away from zero .",
    "in fact , in the early days of this area , conjectures to the contrary had been made .",
    "it turns out , however , that expanders are rather ubiquitous . for every @xmath71 , the probability that a randomly chosen @xmath70-regular graph has expansion @xmath72 tends to @xmath14 as the number of vertices @xmath45 tends to @xmath73 .",
    "it turns out that the metrics of expander graphs are as far from @xmath31 as possible .",
    "[ expander ] let @xmath0 be an @xmath45-vertex @xmath70-regular @xmath67-expander graph ( @xmath71 , @xmath46 ) .",

    "if we compare between the graph itself and its image under an embedding in @xmath31 , this discrepancy must be accounted for by a metrical distortion .",

    "we are now able to complete the proof of theorem  [ multicommodity ] .",
    "we retain the terminology of the discussion around that theorem .",
    "linear programming duality yields the following alternative expression for the maximum @xmath70-commodity flow problem on @xmath176 : @xmath177 here the minimum is over all graphical metrics @xmath164 on @xmath0 .",
    "namely , you assign nonnegative _",
    "lengths _ to @xmath0 s edges and @xmath164 is the induced shortest path metric on @xmath0 s vertices .",
    "now let @xmath164 be the graphical metric that minimizes this expression . a slight adaptation of bourgain s embedding algorithm yields an @xmath100 metric @xmath178 so that @xmath179 for all @xmath180 and @xmath181 for all @xmath120 .",
    "but the minimum of @xmath182 over @xmath100 metrics is attained for @xmath178 a cut metric , since cut metrics are the extreme rays of the cone of @xmath100 metrics @xmath16 .",

    "such an algorithm would solve at one fell swoop a host of interesting ( and hard ) problems such as max - cut , graph bisection and more .",
    "this hope is hard to realize , since the ellipsoid method ( e.g.  @xcite ) applies only to convex bodies for which we have efficient _ membership and separation oracles_. for the convex cone @xmath16 , that would mean that we need to efficiently determine whether a given a real symmetric matrix @xmath183 , represents the metric on @xmath45 points in @xmath100 .",
