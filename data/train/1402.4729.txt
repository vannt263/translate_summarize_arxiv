    "<S> the @xmath0-user multiple - input single - output ( miso ) broadcast channel ( bc ) with hybrid channel state information at the transmitter @xmath1 is considered . in this framework , there is perfect and instantaneous @xmath2 from a subset of users and delayed @xmath2 from the remaining users . </S>",
    "<S> we present new results on the degrees of freedom @xmath3 of the @xmath0-user miso bc with hybrid @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for the case of @xmath4 transmit antennas , we show that with perfect @xmath2 from one user and delayed @xmath2 from the remaining two users , the optimal @xmath5 is @xmath6 . for the case of @xmath0 transmit antennas and the same hybrid @xmath2 setting , it is shown that a higher @xmath5 of @xmath7 is achievable and this result improves upon the best known bound . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , with @xmath0 transmit antennas , and the hybrid @xmath2 setting in which there is perfect @xmath2 from two users and delayed @xmath2 from the third one , a novel scheme is presented which achieves @xmath8 @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> our results also reveal new insights on how to utilize hybrid channel knowledge for multi - user scenarios . </S>"
