    "the observable universe is close to a flat friedmann model , the so - called einstein - de sitter universe , in which the energy density , @xmath3 takes the critical value , @xmath4 , and the homogeneous spatial surfaces are euclidean .",
    "all astronomical evidence shows that we are quite close to this state of flatness , although a value of @xmath5 in the vicinity of @xmath6 is preferred by several observations .",
    "it is therefore disquieting to notice that the flat friedmann model containing dust or blackbody radiation is unstable as time increases .",
    "small deviations from the exact @xmath7 model grow quickly in time , typically like @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the expansion factor of the universe .",
    "the observed @xmath10 state therefore requires extreme fine tuning of the cosmological initial conditions , assumed to be set at planck epoch , because @xmath11 has increased by a factor of order @xmath12 from that epoch to the present .",

    "flatness problem_. if the universe is slightly open at planck time , within a few planck times it would become totally curvature dominated .",
    "if it is initially slightly closed , it would quickly collapse to planck density again . explaining its current state requires an extraordinarily close proximity to perfect flatness initially , or some sequence of events which can subsequently reverse expectations and render the flat solution asymptotically stable .",
    "particle physics theories naturally contain self - interacting scalar matter fields which violate the strong energy condition ( so the density and pressure , @xmath13 , obey @xmath14 ) .",
    "these can make the flat solution asymptotically stable with increasing time , allowing the asymptotic state to naturally be close to flatness .",
    "cosmological histories in which a brief period of expansion is dominated by a matter field or other effective stress which violate the strong energy condition , and so exhibit gravitational repulsion , are called `` inflationary '' .",
    "solutions to the flatness problem have been proposed in the context of inflationary scenarios @xcite , pre - big - bang models @xcite , and varying speed of light cosmologies @xcite . in all of these theories , @xmath7 becomes an asymptotically stable attractor for the expanding universe .",
    "the observed @xmath15 state results then from a temporary period of calculable physical processes , rather than from highly tuned initial conditions . in such scenarios",
    "the price to be paid is that @xmath5 should be very close to unity , @xmath16 @xmath17 , if one is not to invoke an unmotivated fine tuning of the initial conditions again .",

    "the _ lambda problem _ is to understand why the cosmological constant term , @xmath26 in the friedmann equation does not overwhelmingly dominate the density and curvature terms today ( quantum gravity theories suggest that it ought to be about @xmath27 times bigger than observations permit @xcite ) .",
    "the _ quasi - lambda problem _ is to understand how it could be that this contribution to the friedmann equation could be non - zero and of the same order as the density or curvature terms ( as some recent supernovae observations suggest @xcite ) .    in section  [ eqns ]",

    "our numerical code matched this analytical result to very high accuracy . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot numerical results for a radiation - dominated universe .",
    "we comment on four possible situations , illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig4 ] .",
    "if @xmath23 is a constant ( @xmath87 ) then the flat universe ( @xmath88 ) is unstable ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "there are two attractors at @xmath89 and @xmath90 , showing that the universe tends to become curvature dominated . for slightly closed universes",
    "this means evolution towards a big crunch singularity . for slightly open universes",
    "it means evolution towards a milne universe ( @xmath89 ) which in the case of constant @xmath28 is simply an expanding empty spacetime with @xmath91 .",
    "if the speed of light were to increase with @xmath9 ( @xmath92 with @xmath93 ) the situation is the same , but with a stronger repulsion from @xmath88 .",
    "if @xmath92 with @xmath94 , then , as pointed out in @xcite , the flatness problem is solved if @xmath95 is not too far from zero initially .",
    "in fact , @xmath88 is now an attractor ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the non - perturbative analysis reveals two novelties : there is an unstable node at @xmath96 and @xmath97 is an attractor .",
    "this means that if the universe at any given initial time satisfies @xmath98 it will not evolve towards the flat attractor .",
    "instead , it will evolve towards a big crunch with @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , for closed universes , the flatness problem is solved only if they are not too positively curved .",
    "it is curious to note that the situation is different for open universes .",
    "no matter how far they are from flatness they will always evolve towards the einstein - de sitter model at late times .",
    "this was first pointed out in @xcite , where it was noted that in vsl theories the einstein - de sitter universe is an attractor even if the universe is initially minkowski ( empty ) or de sitter ( dominated by a cosmological constant ) .",
    "the greatest novelty , however , appears for the case in which @xmath100 .",
    "although @xmath88 is now unstable , there is a stable attractor at @xmath96 ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the system is now repelled from @xmath89 but is attracted to @xmath99 .",
    "hence we have the following scenario : all closed universes evolve towards a big crunch , no matter how close to flatness they are initially .",
    "thus a selection process excludes even slightly closed universes . _  _ in contrast , flat and all open models ( no matter how low their density ) evolve towards an open model with @xmath101 , a value that lies between @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and is typically of order unity .",
    "we therefore have a solution to the quasi - flatness problem , for open , but not for closed universes .",
    "the @xmath104 case is a transition case in between the last two situations just described ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . in this case",
    "@xmath88 is a saddle : stable if approached from below but unstable from above .      in quasi - flat scenarios the major contribution to the matter density of the universe",
    "is the term resulting from violations of energy conservation .",
    "this can be seen from @xmath105 derived above . taking radiation as an example ( @xmath73 ) ,",
    "if @xmath77 we are pushed towards the attractor @xmath7 and the energy - violation term ( second term ) becomes negligible . in scenarios",
    "in which the quasi - flatness problem is solved the converse happens : the second term dominates .",
    "matter is continuously being created and this provides the dominant contribution to cosmic matter at any given time . matter which was created in the past gets diluted away by expansion very quickly . in effect",
    ", we have a state of permanent `` reheating '' .",
    "this scenario has a passing resemblance with the steady state universe , in which the so called @xmath86 field continuously creates more and more matter .",
    "if we couple a changing @xmath23 say to the lagrangian of the standard particle physics model then all particles are produced , and whether they behave like matter or radiation depends on whether @xmath106 or @xmath107 .",
    "if @xmath85 the energy density in created matter decreases , and the universe cools down as it expands . hence there will necessarily be a radiation to matter transition in these scenarios , just like in the standard big bang theory with constant @xmath108 and @xmath23 .",
    "a complication arises when we attempt to model the evolution through this transition because the structure of the attractors changes . for a radiation - dominated universe",
    "one requires @xmath109 for the open attractor @xmath110 to be achieved . for a matter - dominated universe",
    "the attractors for open universes are given by @xmath111 and are achieved when @xmath112 .",
    "hence , if @xmath113 we have attraction towards a ( quasi - flat ) open universe during the radiation - dominated epoch which is then driven towards flatness in the subsequent matter - dominated epoch . if @xmath114 we have attraction to a ( quasi - flat ) open model in both epochs but the universe will evolve from a trajectory asymptoting to @xmath22 toward one asymptoting to @xmath111 after the matter - radiation equality time .",
    "the solution ( [ soleps ] ) is then no longer valid because @xmath64 is time dependent .",
    "for radiation , @xmath73 , we can solve the field equations by generalising the method introduced for scalar - tensor theories introduced in ref .",

    "we see that    @xmath263 and we have a solution to the quasi - lambda problem ( _ ie _ the problem of why @xmath264 and @xmath265 are of similar order today ) .",
    "recall that in this case we have @xmath85 , @xmath266 and so the asymptote is again of the form @xmath267",
    "scenarios in which the quasi - flatness problem is solved are considerably more exotic than the vsl solution to the flatness problem . unlike flat scenarios they have a planck epoch , something which may be a problem .",
    "we discuss this issue in the appendix .",
    "these scenarios possess several other unusual features . in standard flatness vsl scenarios ,",
    "the expansion factor in the radiation - dominated phase is still @xmath268 .",
    "standard nucleosynthesis should still be valid unless there are changes to other aspects of relevant strong and weak interaction physics ( which seems likely ) .",
    "however in scenarios which solve quasi - flatness we have @xmath269 , which for a @xmath270 attractor means @xmath271 .",
    "this could easily conflict with the nucleosynthesis constraints .",
    "however it is not enough to state that the expansion factor at nucleosynthesis time is different : the couplings , masses , decay times , etc , going into nucleosynthesis are all different @xcite .",
    "one must rework the whole problem from scratch before ruling out these scenarios on grounds of discordant nucleosynthesis predictions .",
    "structure formation is another concern .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the comoving density contrast @xmath272 and gauge - invariant velocity @xmath273 are subject to the equations : @xmath274 where @xmath275 is the comoving wave vector of the fluctuations , and @xmath276 is the entropy production rate , @xmath277 the anisotropic stress , and the speed of sound @xmath278 is given by @xmath279 note that the thermodynamical speed of sound is given by @xmath280 . since in standard big bang models evolution",
    "is isentropic : @xmath281 .",
    "when @xmath282 the evolution need not be isentropic .",
    "however , we keep the definition @xmath283 since this is the definition used in perturbative calculations .",
    "one must however remember that the speed of sound given in ( [ cs ] ) is not the usual thermodynamical quantity . with this definition one",
    "has @xmath284 for adiabatic perturbations ; that is , the ratio between pressure and density fluctuations mimics the ratio of its background rate of change .",
    "let us assume a radiation - dominated background . for superhorizon modes ( @xmath285 )",
    "there is a power - law solution , @xmath286 with @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",
    "the general solution takes the form : @xmath289 where @xmath119 and @xmath170 are constants in time . for a constant @xmath23 ( @xmath87 ) this reduces to the usual @xmath290 growing mode , and @xmath291 decaying mode .",
    "if the flatness problem is to be solved , one must have @xmath77 .",
    "if this condition is satisfied there is no growing mode .",
    "this is an expression , in the context of machian bd scenarios , of the link between solving the flatness problem and suppressing density fluctuations .",
    "flatness is imposed in vsl by violations of energy conservation , acting so as to leave the universe is a state with @xmath7 .",
    "this process acts locally , so it also suppresses density fluctuations .",
    "alternatively , we can see that the approach to flatness everywhere means that inhomogeneous variations in the spatial curvature must also die away .",
    "accordingly , we see that in vsl scenarios there is a strong connection between solving the flatness problem , and predicting a perfectly homogeneous universe .",
    "quasi - flat scenarios therefore risk not solving the homogeneity problem . on the other hand there",
    "could some mechanism for amplifying thermal fluctuations to become seeds for the large scale structure of the universe @xcite .",
    "indeed the equations above should provide a transfer function converting the thermal white noise spectrum into a tilted or flat spectrum .",
    "if this were the case , then these theories would predict a link between the spectral tilt and @xmath200 .",
    "finally , one may wonder whether such @xmath166 could ever arise in a dynamical vsl theory .",
    "in work in preparation @xcite we address this issue , with the result that indeed if @xmath292 is a scalar field with a brans dicke type of dynamics : @xmath293 then one has a machian solution with an exponent @xmath294 related to the coupling @xmath33 of the theory . hence there will be a range of coupling values for which the flatness problem is solved , and a range for which the quasi - flatness problem is solved . in the latter case , not only",
    "can we predict an open attractor but also the value of @xmath200 of the universe is related to a coupling constant .",
    "we have performed an extensive analysis solutions to brans - dicke theories , with varying @xmath28 , in which the speed of light is also permitted to vary in time .",
    "we have found cosmological scenarios with novel features . for power - law variations in the velocity of light with the cosmological scale factor we identified the cases where the flatness problem can be solved .",
    "these generalise the conditions found in earlier investigations of this vsl theory . unlike in inflationary universes which solve the flatness problem ,",
    "no unusual matter fields are required in the early universe .",
    "we have also identified the cases in which the quasi - flatness problem can be solved ; that is , where there can be asymptotic approach at late times to an open universe with a density close to that of the critical value .",
    "similarly , we identified those variations of @xmath23 which provided solutions of the lambda problem and the quasi - lambda problem .",
    "the possibility of solving the quasi - flatness and quasi - lambda problems in this way is a genuine novelty of the vsl theory that distinguishes from the standard inflationary universe scenario .",
    "we have also discussed some problems with the vsl scenario , highlighting in particular the matter - radiation transition solutions and the role of the planck epoch in setting initial conditions ( see appendix for further details ) .",
    "we have also examined the behaviour of inhomogeneous perturbations to the homogeneous and isotropic solutions and found the conditions for density perturbations to grow or decay .",
    "our investigations reinforce the conclusions of our earlier investigations of varying-@xmath23 theories without varying @xmath28 : the scope for obtaining cosmological models which share a number of appealing properties , which closely mirror those of the observed universe , suggest that cosmologies with varying @xmath23 should be thoroughly explored .",
    "it is a challenge to find observational predictions which would allow future satellite probes of the microwave background radiation structure to distinguish them from inflationary universe models ( with constant @xmath23 ) .",
    "we hope that this paper will serve as a further stimulus to undertake those investigations and to search out new ways of testing the constancy of the traditional constants of nature @xcite .",

    "jdb is supported by a pparc senior fellowship .",
    "the machian vsl scenario , in which @xmath154 , introduced by barrow @xcite has significant advantages to the phase transition scenario , in which the speed of light changes suddenly from @xmath295 to @xmath296 preferred by albrecht and magueijo @xcite . in the phase transition scenario one runs into the problem of having to decide when to lay down `` natural initial conditions '' ( that is @xmath95 and @xmath297 of order 1 ) . for a phase transition occurring at time @xmath298 ,",
    "the planck time @xmath299 ( built from the constants as they were before the transition ) is much smaller than @xmath300 . but why should we lay down natural initial conditions just before the phase transition ? if the only scales in the problem are the ones set by the constants as they were before the transition , then natural initial conditions should be set at @xmath301 .",
    "if we are to lay down natural initial conditions at @xmath301 then the universe goes off the attractor well before the phase transition .",
    "a catastrophic phase precedes the phase transition , in which the universe becomes milne ( curvature dominated ) or de sitter ( @xmath1 dominated ) .",
    "albrecht and magueijo noted that this catastrophic phase is not the end of the universe in vsl scenarios .",
    "a varying speed of light would not write off milne or de sitter universes , but would still push them towards an einstein - de sitter universe",
    ". the only universes which would be selected out in this process are the ones with positive curvature , which would end in a big crunch , well before the phase transition .",
    "the machian scenario does not have this problem , if we are content with solving the flatness but not the quasi - flatness problem .",
    "if we consider the radiation dominated phase , @xmath154 with @xmath77 , and @xmath268 , then we have @xmath302 .",
    "hence there is no planck time in these scenarios : as @xmath303 , one has @xmath304 . as we go back in time , the universe becomes hotter and hotter , but the planck temperature also increases , and is never achieved at any time .",
    "the idea of setting natural initial conditions at planck time does not make sense in these scenarios .",
    "we have a universe constantly pushed towards an attractor , which is flat , and has zero cosmological constant .",
