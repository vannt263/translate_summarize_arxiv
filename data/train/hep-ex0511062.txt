    "charmonium was discovered in 1974 . during the next 10 years",
    "a great amount of discovery physics was done by the @xmath0 colliders at slac , desy and orsay . in the 1990 s",
    "the fermilab @xmath6 experiments e760/e835 brought unprecedented mass resolution and precision to charmonium spectroscopy , and the bes detector also made numerous contributions at the beijing @xmath0 collider .",
    "the bes ii detector has since accumulated the world s largest data set with 59 million @xmath7 and 14 million @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , the fermilab experiments were limited because their detector did not have the capability to identify charged hadrons , and the bes detector had limited capability for photon detection .",
    "in contrast , the cleo detector , operating at the cesr @xmath0 collider , is a state - of - the - art solenoidal detector with 93% of @xmath8 coverage .",
    "it contains an excellent csi electromagnetic calorimeter with @xmath9 at 5 gev ( 4% at 100 mev ) , excellent charged particle tracking with @xmath10 at 1 gev/@xmath11 , and a rich detector .",
    "this allows for precision charmonium spectroscopy using @xmath12 fb@xmath13 of @xmath0 data in the bottomonium region ( @xmath14 gev ) , @xmath15 pb@xmath13 of data taken at @xmath1 ( @xmath16 gev ) , and @xmath17 pb@xmath13 taken just belw @xmath1 ( @xmath18 gev ) .",
    "the list of measurements made at cleo in the charmonium region is quite impressive .",
    "they include discovery measurements and precision measurements as described in the following . to put my presentation in perspective , the charmonium spectrum is shown in fig . 1 ( left ) .     potential ( solid line ) , and its coulombic and confinement parts ( dotted lines ) . the approximate locations of the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 states are shown.,width=268 ]",
    "spin singlet states are notoriously difficult to populate in @xmath0 collisions . for example , @xmath24 and @xmath25 can only be reached by weak m1 radiative transitions from the directly produced vector states @xmath7 and @xmath1 , and radiative transition to @xmath26 is forbidden by @xmath27parity conservation . however ,",
    "identification of these states is crucial for understanding the spin ",
    "spin hyperfine interaction in the @xmath28 system .",
    "the nature and development of the hyperfine interaction in going from @xmath19 to @xmath20 states , and in going from @xmath29 to @xmath30wave states , can only be detemined by identifying the spin  singlet partners of the well  established spin ",
    "triplet states , @xmath7 , @xmath1 , and @xmath31 . as fig .",
    "1 ( right ) illustrates , the @xmath20 and @xmath32 states sample mainly the confinement part of the @xmath28 interaction , and determining their hyperfine splitting may be expected to shed light on the nature of the confinement interaction .    *",
    "2.1 the radial excitation of the charmonium ground state , @xmath25 *    both @xmath24 and @xmath33 states are well  established and measured .",
    "the hyperfine splitting is known to be @xmath34 mev .",
    "in contrast , while @xmath35 , or @xmath36 , is well established with @xmath37 mev , until now @xmath25 , or @xmath2 , has remained unidentified . the crystal ball s @xcite claim of the observation of @xmath2 with @xmath38 mev was never confirmed .",
    "several subsequent attempts to find @xmath2 were unsuccessful .",
    "these included @xmath6 experiments e760 and e835 at fermilab @xcite , two ",
    "photon fusion experiments at delphi and l3 at lep , and a recent @xmath1 inclusive photon measurement at cleo @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the breakthrough came , of all the places , from the observation of @xmath2 in @xmath39 decays by belle @xcite .",
    "it was followed by its observation in @xmath40 fusion by us at cleo @xcite , and by babar @xcite ( see fig .",
    "the present world average is @xmath41 mev , which leads to the hyperfine splitting @xmath42 mev .",
    "this is a factor @xmath43 smaller than @xmath44 , and needs to be understood .",
    "is this due to configuration mixing or due to some special aspect of the hyperfine @xmath45 interaction in the confinement region ?",
    "it is worth noting that the width of @xmath2 is essentially unmeasured so far , and that it may shed light on the possible configuration mixing in @xmath2 .",
    "* 2.2 the singlet @xmath46 state , @xmath26 , of charmonium *    if there ever was a more elusive state than @xmath25 , it is @xmath26 , the singlet p - state of charmonium .",
    "its identification is important to determine the hyperfine splitting of p - states . and far greater precision in its mass determination than for @xmath47 is required because it is predicted that @xmath48 for the generally accepted scalar confining potential .    since the @xmath3 , with @xmath49 ,",
    "can not be populated in a radiative transition from the @xmath50 @xmath1 state , neither slac nor bes experiments have ever claimed to observe @xmath51 . in 1992 ,",
    "the fermilab @xmath6 experiment e760 claimed to have identified @xmath3 in the reaction @xmath52 , but larger luminosity runs in 1996 and 2000 have failed to confirm this `` observation '' @xcite .",
    "now , we have made a firm ( significance @xmath53 ) observation of @xmath3 at cleo @xcite . at cleo - c data",
    "were taken at @xmath1 , with 3.08 million @xmath1 .",
    "we have analyzed these data for the population of @xmath3 in the isospin forbidden reaction , @xmath54 both inclusive and exclusive analyses were done , and an accurate determination of @xmath3 mass was made in recoils against @xmath55 s whose energy could be measured with precision ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .    two independent * inclusive analyses * , different in details of event selection , were made .",
    "the decay @xmath56 was identfied by loosely constraining the photon energy in one analysis , and by loosely constraing the @xmath57 mass in the other analaysis .",
    "completely consistent results were obtained . in the * exclusive analysis * , instead of constraining @xmath58 or @xmath59 ,",
    "seven known decay channels with a total branching fraction of @xmath60 were measured . once again , consistent results were obtained .     in (",
    "left ) inclusive analysis and ( right ) exclusive analysis at cleo @xcite.,width=230 ]    the overall result obtained was @xmath61 , or @xmath62    two results follow from our unambiguous observation of @xmath3 .",
    "the first is that @xmath63 is not very different form the pqcd prediction of zero , as was feared by some theorists .",
    "the second is that higher statistics data need to be taken at cleo in order to arrive at a statistically significant result for @xmath63 .",
    "we note that in a recent publication , e835 has claimed evidence for @xmath3 in the reaction @xmath64 in a combined analysis of data from their 1996 and 2000 runs .",
    "however , only ( 7 + 6= ) 13 counts were observed , and the significance of the observation was only @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic form factors of composite particles provide deep insight into their structure , and play an important role in determining the momenta above which perturbative qcd can be considered reliable , a question about which there has been great controversy .    we have used the cleo - c data for @xmath0 collisions at @xmath67 gev with a total integrated luminosity of 20.7 pb@xmath13 to determine the timelike form factors of the kaon and proton at @xmath68 gev@xmath69 @xcite .",

    "this new cleo result has resolved the long  standing discrepancy between the results for the two  photon width of @xmath83 as measured at @xmath0 colliders , via the production of @xmath83 in two  photon fusion , and as measured in @xmath6 annihilation , via the decay of @xmath83 into two photons .",

    "the cleo result leads to @xmath87 , and therefore @xmath88 using pqcd with first order radiative corrections .",
    "in 2003 belle @xcite announced the discovery of an unexpected narrow state , x(3872 ) , in @xmath39decays .",

    "the average of the masses measured by the four experiments is @xmath89 mev .",
    "note that this is very close to @xmath90 mev @xcite .",
    "the unique decay , the narrow width , and the closeness of its mass to @xmath91 have given rise to intense theoretical speculations about the nature of x(3872 ) .",
    "is it a charmonium state ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) , or a hybrid ( @xmath92 ) , or a glueball mixed with vector charmonium ( @xmath50 ) , or a unique ` dimeson ' , a @xmath95 ( @xmath92 , @xmath96 ) molecule ? to sift through these speculations",

    "using 3.08 million @xmath1 decays , cleo @xcite has measured the decays @xmath106 with @xmath107 , many of them for the first time .",
    "a rather curious feature of these results is that the branching ratios for all @xmath108 pairs are nearly the same , @xmath109 .",
    "this is surprising , considering that phase space is quite different for the different @xmath108 pairs .",
    "a simple prediction of pqcd is that the ratio @xmath112 bes has studied this over a long time by measuring many hadronic decays of @xmath1 .",
