    "deutsch @xcite formulates the model of quantum computer which is referred to as quantum turing machine ( qtm ) .",
    "then it is pointed out that there exists a halting scheme problem in case that a qtm takes different time steps for different branches of computation @xcite .",
    "this problem is avoided by bernstein and vazirani @xcite who considers qtm that has the same time steps for all different branches .",
    "the universal quantum turing machine is constructed in this context .",
    "ozawa @xcite proves that the halting scheme is equivalent to the quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) monitoring of the output observable .",
    "linden and popescu @xcite argue that the halting scheme proposed by ozawa @xcite is not consistent with unitarity of the evolution operator and the halting scheme problem is still unsolved .",
    "then ozawa proposes qtm with well - behaved halt flags , and arbitrary qtm can be simulated by this kind of qtm @xcite .",
    "moreover , this kind of qtms obeys a halting protocol , which requires one measurement of the halt flag after one time step .",
    "he shows that the halting protocol does not affect the computing result of qtm .",
    "that means the probability distribution of the output is not affected by monitoring of the halt flag .",
    "thus the halt scheme problem is solved though the qtm may halt probabilistically .",
    "miyadera and ohya @xcite prove it is impossible to efficiently distinguish between those qtms which halts deterministically and those which halts probabilistically .",
    "there are also some discussions about halting of universal qtm @xcite .    in this paper , we consider those qtms which halts deterministically .",
    "firstly , we define a subclass of qtm ( called sr - qtm ) which has the same time steps for all branches of computation and has deterministic tape head position .",
    "then we propose a new way named quantum state transition diagram ( qstd ) to describe sr - qtm .",
    "it is proved that any quantum circuit consisting of cnot and single - qubit gates can be efficiently simulated by sr - qtm .",
    "then , based on universal quantum circuit of near - trivial transformations @xcite , we present a sr - qtm which is universal for all near - trivial transformations @xcite , so we have shown that there exists a qtm which is universal for a subclass of qtm .",
    "finally , the computational power of sr - qtm is analyzed and we prove the computational equivalence ( in the bounded error setting ) between qtm and sr - qtm .",
    "since sr - qtm halts deterministically , the halting scheme problem dissolve in this sense .",
    "qtm is defined by a triplet ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) @xcite , where @xmath0 is a finite alphabet with an identified blank symbol @xmath3 , @xmath1 is a finite set of states with an identified initial state @xmath4 , and final state @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , and @xmath2 , the quantum transition rules , is a function @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 indicate the direction in which the tape head move , and @xmath10=\\{@xmath11 @xmath12 there is a deterministic algorithm that computes the real and imaginary parts of @xmath13 to within @xmath14 in time polynomial in @xmath15}. in the process of quantum computing , the state may be transformed into certain superposition of states in @xmath1 .",
    "qtm measures its state after each step of computing , and the state collapses to one component state .",
    "thus the qtm collapses to certain computational branch and continues its next computation according to the transition function .",
    "* definition 1*. a qtm is called stationary qtm , if it takes the same time steps for all branches of computation , and its tape head always go back to the start cell when the computation terminates .    * definition 2*. a qtm is called unidirectional qtm @xcite , if @xmath16 whenever @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    for a unidirectional qtm , the transition @xmath19 is written as @xmath20 because the transition direction @xmath21 is decided only by the state @xmath22 .",
    "next we define rotational qtm and sr - qtm as follows :    * definition 3*. a qtm is called rotational qtm , if it is unidirectional and satisfies the condition : @xmath23 whenever @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    from our definition of rotational qtm , it can be included that the state to be entered is only related to current state and the content in the tape head .",
    "thus , the transition function of rotational qtm such as @xmath26 can be written as @xmath27 .",
    "we say a qtm has deterministic tape head position @xcite , if this qtm is observed at any time during its computation , the probability that the tape head will be observed in any given location will be either 0 or 1 .",
    "* definition 4*. a qtm is called stationary rotational qtm ( sr - qtm ) if it has deterministic tape head position , and satisfies the conditions in both definition 1 and definition 3 .",
    "in order to further understand sr - qtm , we present a new method called quantum state transition diagram ( qstd ) to describe sr - qtm . the qstd for qca(quantum cellular automata )",
    "is proposed by hook and lee @xcite , but it is different from ours .    by the definition of sr - qtm , the state @xmath22 in the transition @xmath26 is only related with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and the transition direction @xmath21 only depends on @xmath22 , so the transition can be written as @xmath27 .    in qstd ( for instance , fig.[fig1 ] ) , there are two kinds of elements : circle with an alphabet in it , and the line connecting two circles . in the circle ,",
    "the alphabet represents the state , and the arrow over the alphabet indicates the direction in which the tape head move ( the alphabet without arrow is the start state ) . in each line connecting two circles , there is only one arrow which indicates the state which the current state is transferring to .",
    "the alphabet on the tail / head of the line represents the content to be read / write . in the middle of line ,",
    "a number is marked to represent the transition amplitude .",
    "for a given sr - qtm , we can draw a qstd to describe it according to the following two rules :    \\(1 ) for each transition rule of sr - qtm such as @xmath27 , where @xmath30 , the qstd can be represented in fig.[fig1 ] ( suppose @xmath31 ) .",

    "suppose @xmath31 , the left qstd can be simplified as the right one in fig.[fig2 ] .",

    "sr - qtm can be used to efficiently simulate quantum gates such as cnot gate , toffoli gate and the single - qubit rotations in @xmath53 . in this section",
    ", we will construct some sr - qtms simulating these quantum gates , and these sr - qtms will be described using qstd .",

    "the tape head initially stay in cell @xmath42 , and finally go back to cell @xmath42 after carrying out the cnot operation between cell @xmath58 and cell @xmath47 .",
    "it should be noticed that , similar to the construction in fig.[fig3 ] , the cnot operation between any two cells can be efficiently simulated by a sr - qtm .",
    "the qstd of sr - qtm which carries out cnot operation between cell @xmath58 and cell @xmath47 . ]    a simple verification is given to prove that the sr - qtm in fig.[fig4 ] can realize the cnot operation .",

    "it can be seen from the qstd in fig.[fig4 ] that the sr - qtm has @xmath63 steps for all branches of computation .",
