    "an opinion is commonly accepted that quantum gravity should manifest itself only on the planck scale of energies , i.e. it is a high - energy phenomenon .",
    "the value of the planck energy @xmath0 gev has been got from dimensional reasonings .",
    "still one wide - spread opinion is that we know a mechanism of gravity ( bodies are exchanging with gravitons of spin 2 ) but can not correctly describe it .    in a few last years",
    ", the situation has been abruptly changed .",
    "i enumerate those discoveries and observations which may force , in my opinion , the ice to break up .    \\1 . in 1998 , anderson s team reported about the discovery of anomalous acceleration of nasa s probes pioneer 10/11 @xcite ; this effect is not embedded in a frame of the general relativity , and its magnitude is somehow equal to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the hubble constant , @xmath3 is the light velocity .    \\2 . in the same 1998 , two teams of astrophysicists , which were collecting supernovae 1a data with the aim to specificate parameters of cosmological expansion , reported about dimming remote supernovae @xcite ; the one would be explained on a basis of the doppler effect if at present epoch the universe expands with acceleration .",
    "this explanation needs an introduction of some `` dark energy '' which is unknown from any laboratory experiments .",
    "\\3 . in january 2002 ,",
    "nesvizhevsky s team reported about discovery of quantum states of ultra - cold neutrons in the earth s gravitational field @xcite . observed energies of levels ( it means that and their differences too ) in full agreement with quantum - mechanical calculations turned out to be equal to @xmath4 ev .",
    "the formula for energy levels had been found still by bohr and sommerfeld .",
    "if transitions between these levels are accompanied with irradiation of gravitons then energies of irradiated gravitons should have the same order - but it is of 40 orders lesser than the planck energy by which one waits quantum manifestations of gravity .",
    "the first of these discoveries obliges to muse about the borders of applicability of the general relativity , the third - about that quantum gravity would be a high - energy phenomenon .",
    "it seems that the second discovery is far from quantum gravity but it obliges us to look at the traditional interpretation of the nature of cosmological redshift critically .",
    "an introduction into consideration of an alternative model of redshifts @xcite which is based on a conjecture about an existence of the graviton background gives us odds to see on the effect of supernova dimming as an additional manifestation of low - energy quantum gravity . under the definite conditions ,",
    "an effective temperature of the background may be the same one as a temperature of the cosmic microwave background , with an average graviton energy of the order of @xmath5 ev .    in this contribution ( it is a short version of my summarizing paper @xcite ) , the main results of author s research in this approach are described . it is shown that if a redshift would be a quantum gravitational effect then one can get from its magnitude an estimate of a new dimensional constant characterizing a single act of interaction in this model .",
    "it is possible to calculate theoretically a dependence of a light flux relaxation on a redshift value , and this dependence fits supernova observational data very well at least for @xmath6 .",
    "further , it is possible to find a pressure of single gravitons of the background which acts on any pair of bodies due to screening the graviton background with the bodies @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the pressure is huge ( a corresponding force is @xmath7 times stronger than the newtonian attraction ) but it is compensated with a pressure of gravitons which are re - scattered by the bodies . the newtonian attraction arises if a part of gravitons of the background forms pairs which are destructed by interaction with bodies .",
    "it is interesting that both hubble s and newton s constants may be computed in this approach with the ones being connected between themselves .",
    "it allows us to get a theoretical estimate of the hubble constant .",
    "an unexpected feature of this mechanism of gravity is a necessity of `` an atomic structure '' of matter - the mechanism does nt work without the one .",
    "collisions with gravitons should also call forth a deceleration of massive bodies of order @xmath1 - namely the same as of nasa s probes .",
    "but at present stage it turns out unclear why such the deceleration has _ not _ been observed for planets .",
    "the situation reminds by something of the one that took place in physics before the creation of quantum mechanics when a motion of electrons should , as it seemed by canons of classical physics , lead to their fall to a nucleus .",
    "so , in this approach we deal with the following small quantum effects of low - energy gravity : redshifts , its analog - a deceleration of massive bodies , and an additional relaxation of any light flux .",
    "the newtonian attraction turns out to be the main statistical effect , with bodies themselves being not sources of gravitons - only correlational properties of _ in _ and _ out _ fluxes of gravitons in their neighbourhood are changed due to an interaction with bodies .",
    "there does still not exist a full and closed theory in this approach , but even the initial researches in this direction show that in this case quantum gravity can not be described separately of other interactions , and also manifest the boundaries of applicability of a geometrical language in gravity .",
    "let us introduce the hypothesis , which is considered in this approach as independent from the standard cosmological model : there exists the isotropic graviton background .",
    "photon scattering is possible on gravitons @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a photon and @xmath10 is a graviton , if one of the gravitons is virtual .",
    "the energy - momentum conservation law prohibits energy transfer to free gravitons . due to forehead collisions with gravitons ,",
    "an energy of any photon should decrease when it passes through the sea of gravitons .    from another side , none - forehead collisions of photons with gravitons of the background will lead to an additional relaxation of a photon flux , caused by transmission of a momentum transversal component to some photons .",
    "it will lead to an additional dimming of any remote objects , and may be connected with supernova dimming .",
    "we deal here with the uniform non - expanding universe with the euclidean space , and there are not any cosmological kinematic effects in this model .",
    "we shall take into account that a gravitational `` charge '' of a photon must be proportional to @xmath11 ( it gives the factor @xmath12 in a cross - section ) and a normalization of a photon wave function gives the factor @xmath13 in the cross - section .",
    "also we assume here that a photon average energy loss @xmath14 in one act of interaction is relatively small to a photon energy @xmath15 then average energy losses of a photon with an energy @xmath16 on a way @xmath17 will be equal to @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a constant . if a _ whole _",
    "redshift magnitude is caused by this effect , we must identify @xmath20 where @xmath3 is the light velocity , to have the hubble law for small distances @xcite .    a photon energy @xmath11 should depend on a distance from a source @xmath21 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an initial value of energy .",
    "the expression ( 2 ) is just only so far as the condition @xmath24 takes place .",
    "photons with a very small energy may lose or acquire an energy changing their direction of propagation after scattering . early or late such photons should turn out in the thermodynamic equilibrium with the graviton background , flowing into their own background .",
    "decay of virtual gravitons should give photon pairs for this background , too .",
    "perhaps , the last one is the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "it follows from the expression ( 2 ) that an exact dependence @xmath25 is the following one : @xmath26 if an interaction with the graviton background is the only cause of redshifts .",
    "it is very important , that this redshift does not depend on a light frequency . for small @xmath27",
    "the dependence @xmath25 will be linear .",
    "the expressions ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) are the same that appear in other tired - light models ( compare with @xcite ) . in this approach ,",
    "the ones follow from a possible existence of the isotropic graviton background , from quantum electrodynamics , and from the fact that a gravitational `` charge '' of a photon must be proportional to @xmath15    there are two difficulties in this model : ( i ) possible blurring of point sources , and ( ii ) the rise to fall time of the light curve for sn1a sources ( the relativistic time dilation effect ) @xcite is in apparent conflict with the ideas here and of any `` tired light '' explanation of effect .",
    "the problems are now open .",
    "i think that for ( i ) , a solution will be based on the following : an average graviton energy is not equal to zero , and after multiple non - forehead collisions , photons should be rejected from the registered flux - without a loss of definition of the source . for (",
    "ii ) , a discrete character of photon energy losses ( for some more details , see the very end of subsection 2.3 ) would lead to a deformation of the light curve and may give something like to time dilation - but now , it is only the idea .",
    "photon flux s average energy losses on a way @xmath28 due to non - forehead collisions with gravitons should be proportional to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a new constant of the order @xmath31 these losses are connected with a rejection of a part of photons from a source - observer direction",
    ". such the relaxation together with the redshift will give a connection between visible object s diameter and its luminosity ( i.e. the ratio of an object visible angular diameter to a square root of visible luminosity ) , distinguishing from the one of the standard cosmological model .",
    "let us consider that in a case of a non - forehead collision of a graviton with a photon , the latter leaves a photon flux detected by a remote observer ( an assumption of a narrow beam of rays ) .",
    "the details of calculation of the theoretical value of relaxation factor @xmath30 which was used in author s paper @xcite were given later in the preprint @xcite .",
    "so as both particles have velocities @xmath32 a cross - section of interaction , which is `` visible '' under an angle @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , will be equal to @xmath34 if @xmath35 is a cross - section by forehead collisions .",
    "the function @xmath36 allows to take into account both front and back hemispheres for riding gravitons .",
    "additionally , a graviton flux , which falls on a picked out area ( cross - section ) , depends on the angle @xmath37 we have for the ratio of fluxes : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the fluxes which fall on @xmath35 under the angle @xmath33 and normally , @xmath41 is a square of side surface of a truncated cone with a base @xmath35 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    = 12.98 cm    finally , we get for the factor @xmath42 @xmath43 by @xmath44 a formed cone contains self - intersections , and it is @xmath45 .",
    "by @xmath46 we have @xmath47 .",
    "after computation of simple integrals , we get : @xmath48 in the considered simplest case of the uniform non - expanding universe with the euclidean space , we shall have the quantity @xmath49 in a visible object diameter - luminosity connection if a whole redshift magnitude would caused by such an interaction with the background ( instead of @xmath50 for the expanding uniform universe ) . for near sources ,",
    "the estimate of the factor @xmath30 will be some increased one .",
    "the luminosity distance ( see @xcite ) is a convenient quantity for astrophysical observations .",
    "both redshifts and the additional relaxation of any photonic flux due to non - forehead collisions of gravitons with photons lead in our model to the following luminosity distance @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 .      to compare a form of this predicted dependence @xmath54 by unknown , but constant @xmath2 , with the latest observational supernova data by riess et al .",
    "@xcite , one can introduce distance moduli @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is an unknown constant ( it is a single free parameter to fit the data ) ; @xmath57 is the luminosity distance in units of @xmath58 .",
    "= 12.98 cm    in figure 2 , the hubble diagram @xmath59 is shown with @xmath60 to fit observations for low redshifts ; observational data ( 82 points ) are taken from table 5 of @xcite .",
    "the predictions fit observations very well for roughly @xmath6 .",
    "it excludes a need of any dark energy to explain supernovae dimming .",
    "discrepancies between predicted and observed values of @xmath59 are obvious for higher @xmath61 : we see that observations show brighter sne that the theory allows , and a difference increases with @xmath61 .",
    "it is better seen on figure 3 with a linear scale for @xmath57 ; observations are transformed as @xmath62 with the same @xmath60 . ; it might be partially caused by quickly raising contribution of a dispersion of measured flux : it should be proportional to @xmath63 . ]",
    "= 12.98 cm    it would be explained in the model as a result of specific deformation of sn spectra due to a discrete character of photon energy losses .",
    "today , a theory of this effect does not exist , and i explain its origin only qualitatively @xcite . for very small redshifts",
    "@xmath27 only a small part of photons transmits its energy to the background ( see fig . 8 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore any red - shifted narrow spectral strip will be a superposition of two strips .",
    "one of them has a form which is identical to an initial one , its space is proportional to @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an average number of interactions of a single photon with the background , and its center s shift is negligible ( for a narrow strip ) .",
    "another part is expand , its space is proportional to @xmath66 and its center s shift is equal to @xmath67 where @xmath68 is an average energy loss in one act of interaction .",
    "an amplitude of the red - shifted step should linear raise with a redshift . for big @xmath27 spectra of remote objects of the universe would be deformed .",
    "a deformation would appear because of multifold interactions of a initially - red - shifted part of photons with the graviton background .",
    "it means that the observed flux within a given passband would depend on a form of spectrum : the flux may be larger than an expected one without this effect if an initial flux within a next - blue neighbour band is big enough - due to a superposition of red - shifted parts of spectrum .",
    "some other evidences of this effect would be an apparent variance of the fine structure constant @xcite or of the cmb temperature @xcite with epochs .",
    "in both cases , a ratio of red - shifted spectral line s intensities may be sensitive to the effect .",
    "also , this effect should be taken into account when one analyzes a temporal evolution of supernova spectra to detect the relativistic `` time dilation '' effect @xcite .",
    "let us consider that a full redshift magnitude is caused by an interaction with single gravitons . if @xmath69 is a cross - section of interaction by forehead collisions of a photon with an energy @xmath11 with a graviton , having an energy @xmath70 we consider really ( see ( 1 ) ) , that @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a space angle element , and the function @xmath73 has a constant value for any @xmath74 . if @xmath75 is a spectral density of graviton flux in the limits of @xmath72 in some direction ( @xmath76 is a graviton frequency , @xmath77 ) , i.e. an intensity of a graviton flux is equal to the integral @xmath78 @xmath79 is an equivalent temperature of the graviton background , we can write for the hubble constant @xmath80 introduced in the expression ( 1 ) : @xmath81 if @xmath82 can be described by the planck formula for equilibrium radiation , then @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the stephan- boltzmann constant . as carriers of a gravitational `` charge ''",
    "( without consideration of spin properties ) , gravitons should be described in the same manner as photons , i.e. one can write for them : @xmath85 now let us introduce a new dimensional constant @xmath86 , so that for forehead collisions : @xmath87 then @xmath88 where @xmath89 is an average graviton energy . assuming @xmath90 and @xmath91 we get the following rough estimate for @xmath92 @xmath93 ( see below subsection [ subsec:4.3 ] for more exact estimate of @xmath86 and for a theoretical estimate of @xmath2 ) that gives us the phenomenological estimate of cross - section by the same and equal @xmath11 and @xmath89 : @xmath94",
    "as it was reported by anderson s team @xcite , nasa deep - space probes ( pioneer 10/11 , galileo , and ulysses ) experience a small additional constant acceleration , directed towards the sun ( the pioneer anomaly ) . today , a possible origin of the effect is unknown .",
    "it must be noted here that the reported direction of additional acceleration may be a result of the simplest conjecture , which was accepted by the authors to provide a good fit for all probes .",
    "one should compare different conjectures to choose the one giving the best fit .",
    "we consider here a deceleration of massive bodies , which would give a similar deformation of cosmic probes trajectories @xcite .",
    "the one would be a result of interaction of a massive body with the graviton background , but such an additional acceleration will be directed against a body velocity .",
    "it follows from a universality of gravitational interaction , that not only photons , but all other objects , moving relative to the background , should lose their energy , too , due to such a quantum interaction with gravitons . if @xmath20 it turns out that massive bodies must feel a constant deceleration of the same order of magnitude as a small additional acceleration of cosmic probes .",
    "let us now denote as @xmath11 a full energy of a moving body which has a velocity @xmath95 relative to the background .",
    "then energy losses of the body by an interaction with the graviton background ( due to forehead collisions with gravitons ) on the way @xmath28 must be expressed by the same formula ( 1 ) : @xmath18 where @xmath96 if @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a time , and @xmath99 then we get for the body acceleration @xmath100 by a non - zero velocity : @xmath101 we assume here , that non - forehead collisions with gravitons give only stochastic deviations of a massive body s velocity direction , which are negligible . for small velocities : @xmath102 if the hubble constant @xmath2 is equal to @xmath103 ( it is the theoretical estimate of @xmath2 in this approach , see below subsection [ subsec:4.3 ] ) , a modulus of the acceleration will be equal to @xmath104 that has the same order of magnitude as a value of the observed additional acceleration @xmath105 for nasa probes .",
    "i must emphasize here that the acceleration @xmath106 is directed against a body velocity only in a special frame of reference ( in which the graviton background is isotropic ) .",
    "i would like to note that a deep - space mission to test the discovered anomaly is planned now at nasa by the authors of this very important discovery @xcite .",
    "it is very important to understand , why such an acceleration has not been observed for planets .",
    "this acceleration will have different directions by motion of a body on a closed orbit , and one must take into account a solar system motion , too . as a result , an orbit should be deformed . the observed value of anomalous acceleration of pioneer 10 should represent the vector difference of the two accelerations @xcite : an acceleration of pioneer 10 relative to the graviton background , and an acceleration of the earth relative to the background .",
    "possibly , the last is displayed as an annual periodic term in the residuals of pioneer 10 @xcite .",
    "if the solar system moves with a noticeable velocity relative to the background , the earth s anomalous acceleration projection on the direction of this velocity will be smaller than for the sun - because of the earth s orbital motion .",
    "it means that in a frame of reference , connected with the sun , the earth should move with an anomalous acceleration having non - zero projections as well on the orbital velocity direction as on the direction of solar system motion relative to the background . under some conditions ,",
    "the earth s anomalous acceleration in this frame of reference may be periodic .",
    "the axis of earth s orbit should feel an annual precession by it .",
    "this question needs a further consideration .",
    "it was shown by the author @xcite that screening the background of super - strong interacting gravitons creates for any pair of bodies both attraction and repulsion forces due to pressure of gravitons .",
    "for single gravitons , these forces are approximately balanced , but each of them is much bigger than a force of newtonian attraction .",
    "if single gravitons are pairing , an attraction force due to pressure of such graviton pairs is twice exceeding a corresponding repulsion force if graviton pairs are destructed by collisions with a body .",
    "in such the model , the newton constant is connected with the hubble constant that gives a possibility to obtain a theoretical estimate of the last .",
    "we deal here with a flat non - expanding universe fulfilled with super - strong interacting gravitons ; it changes the meaning of the hubble constant which describes magnitudes of three small effects of quantum gravity but not any expansion or an age of the universe .",
    "if gravitons of the background run against a pair of bodies with masses @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( and energies @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) from infinity , then a part of gravitons is screened .",
    "let @xmath111 is a cross - section of interaction of body @xmath112 with a graviton with an energy @xmath113 where @xmath76 is a graviton frequency , @xmath114 is the same cross - section for body @xmath115 in absence of body @xmath116 a whole modulus of a gravitonic pressure force acting on body @xmath112 would be equal to : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is a graviton spectrum with a temperature @xmath79 ( assuming to be planckian ) , the factor @xmath119 in front of @xmath120 is introduced to allow all possible directions of graviton running , @xmath121 is another average energy of running gravitons with a frequency @xmath76 taking into account a probability of that in a realization of flat wave a number of gravitons may be equal to zero , and that not all of gravitons ride at a body .",

    "this conclusion , as we shall see below , stays in force for the case of graviton pairing , too .      to ensure an attractive force which is not equal to a repulsive one",
    ", particle correlations should differ for _ in _ and _ out _ flux .",
    "for example , single gravitons of running flux may associate in pairs @xcite .",
    "if such pairs are destructed by collision with a body , then quantities @xmath121 will be distinguished for running and scattered particles .",
    "graviton pairing may be caused with graviton s own gravitational attraction or gravitonic spin - spin interaction .",
    "left an analysis of the nature of graviton pairing for the future ; let us see that gives such the pairing .    to find an average number of pairs @xmath151 in a wave with a frequency @xmath76 for the state of thermodynamic equilibrium , one may replace @xmath152 by deducing the planck formula .",

    "an estimate of distances to objects with given @xmath61 is changed , too : for example , the quasar with @xmath209 @xcite should be in a distance approximately @xmath210 times bigger than the one expected in the model based on the doppler effect .",
    "= 12.98 cm    we can assume that the graviton background and the cosmic microwave one are in a state of thermodynamical equilibrium , and have the same temperatures .",
    "cmb itself may arise as a result of cooling any light radiation up to reaching this equilibrium .",
    "then it needs @xmath211 to get through the very edge of our cosmic `` ecumene '' .",
    "some other possible cosmological consequences of an existence of the graviton background were described in @xcite .",
    "observations of last years give us strong evidences for supermassive and compact objects ( named now supermassive black holes ) in active and normal galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "massive nuclear `` black holes '' of @xmath212 solar masses may be responsible for the energy production in quasars and active galaxies @xcite . in a frame of this model",
    ", an existence of black holes contradicts to the equivalence principle .",
    "it means that these objects should have another nature ; one must remember that we know only that these objects are supermassive and compact .",
    "there should be two opposite processes of heating and cooling the graviton background @xcite which may have a big impact on cosmology . unlike models of expanding universe , in any tired light model one has a problem of utilization of energy , lost by radiation of remote objects . in the considered model , a virtual graviton forms under collision of a photon with a graviton of the graviton background",
    ". it should be massive if an initial graviton transfers its total momentum to a photon ; it follows from the energy conservation law that its energy @xmath213 must be equal to @xmath214 if @xmath215 is an initial graviton energy . in force of the uncertainty relation ,",
    "one has for a virtual graviton lifetime @xmath216",
    "@xmath217 i.e. for @xmath218 it is @xmath219 in force of conservation laws for energy , momentum and angular momentum , a virtual graviton may decay into no less than three real gravitons . in a case of decay into three gravitons , its energies should be equal to @xmath220 with @xmath221 so , after this decay , two new gravitons with @xmath222 inflow into the graviton background .",
    "it is a source of adjunction of the graviton background .",
    "from another side , an interaction of gravitons of the background between themselves should lead to the formation of virtual massive gravitons , too , with energies less than @xmath223 where @xmath223 is a minimal energy of one graviton of an initial interacting pair . if gravitons with energies @xmath224 wear out a file of collisions with gravitons of the background , its lifetime increases .",
    "in every such a collision - decay cycle , an average energy of `` redundant '' gravitons will double decrease , and its lifetime will double increase . only for @xmath225 cycles , a lifetime will increase from @xmath226 to @xmath227 gyr .",
    "such virtual massive gravitons , with a lifetime increasing from one collision to another , would duly serve dark matter particles . having a zero ( or near to zero ) initial velocity relative to the graviton background",
    ", the ones will not interact with matter in any manner excepting usual gravitation .",
    "an ultra - cold gas of such gravitons will condense under influence of gravitational attraction into `` black holes '' or other massive objects . additionally to it , even in absence of initial heterogeneity , the one will easy arise in such the gas that would lead to arising of super compact massive objects , which will be able to turn out `` germs '' of `` black holes '' .",
    "it is a method `` to cool '' the graviton background .",
    "so , the graviton background may turn up `` a perpetual engine '' of the universe , pumping energy from any radiation to massive objects .",
    "an equilibrium state of the background will be ensured by such a temperature @xmath228 for which an energy profit of the background due to an influx of energy from radiation will be equal to a loss of its energy due to a catch of virtual massive gravitons with `` black holes '' or other massive objects .",
    "in such the picture , the chances are that `` black holes '' would turn out `` germs '' of galaxies . after accumulation of a big enough energy by a `` black hole '' ( to be more exact , by a super - compact massive object ) by means of a catch of virtual massive gravitons ,",
    "the one would be absolved from an energy excess in via ejection of matter , from which stars of galaxy should form .",
    "it awaits to understand else in such the approach how usual matter particles form from virtual massive gravitons .",
    "there is a very interesting but non - researched possibility : due to relative decreasing of an intensity of graviton pair flux in an internal area of galaxies ( pairs are destructed under collisions with matter particles ) , the effective newton constant may turn out to be running on galactic scales .",
    "it might lead to something like to the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) by mordehai milgrom ( about mond , for example , see @xcite ) . but to evaluate this effect , one should take into account a relaxation process for pairs , about which we know nothing today .",
    "it is obvious only that gravity should be stronger on a galactic periphery .",
    "it follows from the above consideration that the geometrical description of gravity should be a good idealization for any pair of bodies at a big distance by the condition of an `` atomic structure '' of matter .",
    "this condition can not be accepted only for black holes which must interact with gravitons as aggregated objects .",
    "in addition , the equivalence principle is roughly broken for black holes , if the described quantum mechanism of classical gravity is realized in the nature .",
    "because attracting bodies are not initial sources of gravitons , a future theory must be non - local in this sense to describe gravitons running from infinity .",
    "the le sage s idea to describe gravity as caused by running _ ab extra _",
    "particles was criticized by the great physicist richard feynman in his public lectures at cornell university @xcite , but the pioneer 10 anomaly @xcite , perhaps , is a good contra argument pro this idea .",
    "the described quantum mechanism of classical gravity is obviously asymmetric relative to the time inversion . by the time inversion",
    ", single gravitons would run against bodies to form pairs after collisions with bodies .",
    "it would lead to replacing a body attraction with a repulsion .",
    "but such the change will do impossible the graviton pairing .",
    "a future theory dealing with gravitons as usual particles should have a number of features which are not characterizing any existing model to image the considered here features of the possible quantum mechanism of gravity .",
    "if this mechanism is realized in the nature , both the general relativity and quantum mechanics should be modified .",
    "any divergencies , perhaps , would be not possible in such the model because of natural smooth cut - offs of the graviton spectrum from both sides .",
    "gravity at short distances , which are much bigger than the planck length , needs to be described only in some unified manner .",
