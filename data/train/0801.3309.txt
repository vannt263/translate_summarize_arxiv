    "it is well known that every closed , orientable , connected @xmath1-manifold @xmath0 can be obtained by integral surgery on a link in @xmath3 .",

    "for convenience , we use the word _",
    "simple @xmath4-link _ to denote an @xmath4-component link with all its components being unknots in @xmath3 .",
    "then the minimal number @xmath5 of the components in all integral simple @xmath4-link surgery presentations for @xmath0 is a topological invariant of @xmath0 , that is : @xmath6    @xmath7 + for example : @xmath8 and @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a lens space ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "however , it is not easy to compute @xmath5 in general . in particular , let @xmath12 denote the @xmath1-manifold got from integral surgery on a knot @xmath13 with surgery index @xmath14 .",
    "then it is easy to see that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the unknotting number of @xmath17 .",
    "but in fact , we can prove the following :    [ main ] for any knot @xmath13 and any integer @xmath14 , @xmath18 , i.e. we can always construct @xmath12 by doing an integral surgery on a simple @xmath1-link in @xmath3 .",
    "* remark : * in @xcite , d.auckly defined a topological invariant called _ surgery number _ of a closed @xmath1-manifolds . by his definition ,",
    "the surgery number of @xmath12 is @xmath19 for any knot @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath5 defined above can be considered as another type of surgery number which is more subtle than auckly s in the sense that @xmath20 could be different for different knot @xmath17 .",
    "+ the geometric and topological properties of @xmath12 have been studied intensively , which reveals much topological information of the knot @xmath17 itself .",
    "theorem   ought to be useful to understand the geometry and topology of @xmath12 and hence @xmath17 in the future .",
    "in this section , we will introduce some special operations on a knot diagram called _ skein - move_. we will see that the skein - move along with plane isotopies and the reidemeister moves can turn any knot diagram on a plane into the diagram of a simple @xmath21-link . + first of all , for any knot @xmath13 , we can use plane isotopy and reidemeister moves to turn any diagram of @xmath17 into the form that all crossings in the diagram are on a short arc of @xmath17 .",
    "+ the idea is : starting from any diagram @xmath22 of @xmath17 , we consider @xmath22 as the closure of a @xmath19-tangle @xmath23 .",
    "then we label the crossings on @xmath23 according to their first appearance when we travel from the bottom end @xmath24 of @xmath23 to the top end @xmath25 of @xmath23 , see figure   for example . notice that we will meet each crossing of @xmath23 twice in the process , but",

    "see the figure   for example .",
    "+    denote the crossings by @xmath27 according to their labels .",
    "then , start from the crossing @xmath28 , we can extend a small segment of the strand ( overstrand or understrand ) at @xmath28 down along the arc of @xmath23 that connects @xmath28 and the bottom end @xmath24 , until it meet the line segment @xmath29 . to be more precise ,",
    "when we travel along the tangle starting from @xmath24 and meet the crossing @xmath28 at the first time , if we are standing on the understrand of @xmath28 , we extend the overstrand of @xmath28 down via the process described .",
    "otherwise , we extend the understrand of @xmath28 down ( see the figure  [ p : tangle ] ) . obviously , this will reduce the number of crossings of the tangle above the line segment @xmath29 by @xmath19 .",
    "next , we do the same extension process to strands at @xmath30 one by one according to their labeled order . when we finish this ,",
    "all the crossings of the tangle will be moved to the segment @xmath29 .",
    "then connect @xmath25 and @xmath26 via a simple arc far away from @xmath23 , we get a diagram of @xmath17 in the required form .",
    "this form of knot diagram is called _ well - posed_. + * remark : * the dowker notation ( see @xcite ) of a well - posed knot diagram with @xmath14-crossings has the property that : in the two numbers associated to each crossing , one is @xmath31 , the other is @xmath32 .",
    "+ next , we orient the knot from @xmath26 to @xmath24 .",
    "the general picture of a well - posed knot diagram is like figure  [ p : gd ] .",
    "notice that , we can always use the skein move defined in figure  [ p : gd ] to turn a well - posed knot diagram into a two - component link @xmath2 . and",

    "suppose @xmath17 is a knot in @xmath3 , let @xmath33 be a small tubular neighborhood of @xmath17 and @xmath34 . up to isotopy , @xmath35 has a _",

    "@xmath36 which is homologically trivial in @xmath37 . and",
    "let @xmath14 be a _ meridian _ of @xmath35 which bounds a disk in @xmath38 .",

    "a @xmath39-surgery is called _ integral _ if @xmath46 .",

    "+ moreover , we can similarly define surgery on any link @xmath47 .",
    "the surgery is called _ integral _ if the surgery on each component of @xmath2 is integral .",
    "integral surgery on a link @xmath48 decides an integer @xmath49 for each component @xmath50 in @xmath2 , which is called a _ framing _ of @xmath2 .",
    "a link @xmath2 with a fixed framing will be called _",
    "framed link_. so we can also say that any closed orientable @xmath1-manifolds can be got from a surgery on a framed link in @xmath3 .",
    "+ surgery on different framed links may give the same @xmath1-manifold .",
    "following are two elementary operations on a framed link @xmath2 called _ kirby moves _ ( see @xcite ) which do not change the corresponding @xmath1-manifold . +     * k@xmath19 move * : :    add or delete an unknotted circle with framing @xmath51    which belongs to a @xmath1-ball that does not intersect the    other components on @xmath2 .",
    "+   * k@xmath21 move * : :    slide one component @xmath52 onto another component    @xmath53 .",
    "namely , let @xmath54 be a longitude of    the tubular neighborhood of @xmath53 whose linking number    with @xmath53 is the framing index @xmath55 of    @xmath53 .",
    "now replace @xmath52 by    @xmath56 where @xmath57 is any band    connecting @xmath52 to @xmath54 and disjoint from    the other components of @xmath2 .",
    "the framing of    @xmath58 is @xmath59 where    @xmath60 is the linking number of @xmath52    and @xmath53 in @xmath3 with respect to some    orientations of them .",
    "the rest of the framed link    @xmath2 remains unchanged . to compute    @xmath60 ,",
    "we orient @xmath52 and    @xmath53 in such a way that together they define an    orientation on @xmath58 .",
    "so different orientations of    @xmath52 and @xmath53 may end up with different    framed links ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+      moreover , it is shown in @xcite that any two framed links which give the same @xmath1-manifolds can always be transformed into each other via a finite number of kirby moves .",
    "we can use this to show the following lemma .",
    "[ cancel ] if in a framed link @xmath61 a component @xmath62 is an unknot with framing zero which links only one other component @xmath52 geometrically once , then @xmath63 may be moved away from the link @xmath61 without changing the resulting @xmath1-manifold and framings of other components , and cancelled ( see the following figure [ p : cancel ] ) +      * proof of theorem  [ main ] : * by the discussion of previous section , we can turn a knot diagram @xmath17 into a simple @xmath21-link diagram via plane isotopy , reidemeister moves and the skein move , and vice versa .",
    "now suppose @xmath17 is framed by @xmath14 , it corresponds to a closed @xmath1-manifolds @xmath12 via integral surgery .",
    "of course , doing skein move to @xmath17 will not preserve the corresponding @xmath1-manifold in any sense .",
    "however , the figure  [ p : trans ] below shows that doing an integral surgery on a well - posed diagram of @xmath17 is equivalent to doing integral surgeries on its corresponding simple @xmath21-link under skein - move and an additional @xmath64-framed unknot . in the figure  [ p : trans ]",
    ", @xmath23 inside the rectangular box represents a tangle of two unknotted strings .",
    "the proof is just a direct application of kirby moves and lemma  [ cancel ] .",
    "therefore , integral surgery on a framed simple @xmath1-link can give @xmath12 for any knot @xmath17 and any integer @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 +        1 .",
    "the diagrams for @xmath68 have no self crossings and the geometric intersection number of @xmath52 or @xmath53 with a @xmath21-disk bounded by @xmath62 is @xmath19 .",
    "+ 2 .   we can fix the framing on one of the @xmath68 to be @xmath19 ( or @xmath69 ) in the simple @xmath1-link .",
    "there are infinite different framings on a fixed simple @xmath1-link that can give the same @xmath1-manifold @xmath12 !",
    "we can require the linking number @xmath70 in the simple @xmath1-link by doing second kirby moves to @xmath52 and @xmath62 in the figure  [ p : trans ] .",
    "+    * remark : * obviously , integral surgeries on simple @xmath1-links will give lots of @xmath1-manifolds other than @xmath12 .",
    "we can change the way how @xmath62 is linked to @xmath68 and the surgery index of @xmath62 . so theorem  [ main ] may be useful for us to construct some interesting examples like integral homology @xmath1-spheres other than @xmath71 . +        obviously , if @xmath73 , @xmath74 must be lens space .",
    "but it is not clear how to classify closed @xmath1-manifolds @xmath74 with @xmath75 . in particular",
    ", we can ask the following question .",
    "+ * question 1 : * for what knot @xmath17 and integer @xmath14 , @xmath76 ?",
    "+ there are some obvious candidates for the question . for example",
    ": if the unknotting number of @xmath17 is @xmath19 , @xmath76 for any @xmath14 .",
    "but it is not clear how to give a complete answer to this question . in particular , it is interesting to know whether @xmath76 for all knot @xmath17 and @xmath77 . + also , it is natural to consider @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "for example when @xmath17 is the unknot , @xmath45 is the lens space @xmath80 .",
    "suppose the continued fraction decomposition of @xmath81 is @xmath82 $ ] , where @xmath83= x_1 - \\frac{1}{\\displaystyle x_2                                  - \\frac{1}{\\displaystyle \\cdots x_{n-1}-                                  \\frac{1}{\\displaystyle x_n}}}\\ ] ] then @xmath80 has a surgery presentation as shown in the figure  [ p : lens ] .",
    "so @xmath84 .",
    "notice that there are examples for @xmath85 $ ] with @xmath86 but @xmath87 .",
    "in fact , in @xcite , it is shown that @xmath88 could be obtained by @xmath89-surgery on the @xmath90-cable knot about the trefoil knot , so @xmath91 while @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "more examples of getting lens space via integral surgeries on knots in @xmath3 can be found in @xcite .",
    "+      * question 2 : * does there exist an integer @xmath93 such that @xmath94 for all @xmath95 ? + * remark : * @xcite also gave a way of presenting @xmath45 by an integral surgery on some link .",
    "but we will not get any universal bounds of @xmath78 for all @xmath17 and @xmath39 via the method in @xcite .",
    "+ theorem  [ main ] provides an interesting way to see @xmath12 via surgery diagrams . from the proof of theorem  [ main ]",
    ", we can see that the topological information of @xmath12 is completely encoded in how @xmath52 and @xmath53 are linked together and the surgery index @xmath14 .",
    "notice all the crossings in the diagrams of @xmath96 are between @xmath97 .",
