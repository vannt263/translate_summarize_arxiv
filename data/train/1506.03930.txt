    "that is , there can be introduced in a natural way an ordering on the set of all maximal blocks of a complete tolerance , such that the factor set , together with this ordering , is again a complete lattice .",
    "we show that the same holds for complete @xmath17-tolerances on completely lattice @xmath17-ordered sets .",
    "more precisely , we use the usual definition of fuzzy tolerance and corresponding factor set and introduce an @xmath17-order on the factor set of completely lattice @xmath17-ordered set by a complete @xmath17-tolerance , such that the new @xmath17-order is again a complete lattice @xmath17-order .    to prove this main result",
