    "the paradigmatic example is the _ prisoner s dilemma _ ( pd ) game in which the four payoffs are ranked as @xmath7 .",
    "it clearly pays more to defect whatever the opponent s strategy : the gain will be @xmath8 if the other cooperates and @xmath9 if he defects .",

    "classical evolutionary game theory constitutes a mean - field - like approximation which does not include the effect of spatial , correlated structures of populations .",

    "this cellular automaton was explored by nowak and may  @xcite , who found that such spatial structure allows cooperators to build clusters in which the benefits of mutual cooperation can outweigh losses against defectors , thus enabling cooperation to be sustained , in contrast with the spatially unstructured game , where defection is always favored .",

    "moreover , those clusters so necessary to sustain cooperation may now evaporate .",
    "both these effects promote defection and the number of cooperators is expected to decrease . on the other hand , dilution  @xcite and mobility decrease the competition for local resources and help to avoid retaliation and abuse ( although that may require more contingent movements ) , thus tending to increase cooperation . in the evolutionary game context , diffusion was studied by several authors , sometimes as a cost to wander between patches without spatial structure  @xcite or as a trait connected with laying offspring within a given dispersal range  @xcite .",
    "an explicit diffusive process was studied in the framework of the replicator equation  @xcite , extended to include a diffusive term  @xcite ; however , the interactions were still mean field like .",

    "models with alternating viscosities , which reflect different stages of development that can benefit from the clusterization of cooperators or from dispersal , have also been considered and promote altruism , since the high viscosity phase allows interactions between close relatives and the low viscosity phase reduces the disadvantages of local competition among related individuals . in cases of populations with only a highly viscous phase ,",
    "the effects of interactions among relatives and competition for local resources tend to balance and thus the evolution of altruistic behavior is inhibited  @xcite .",

    "cooperation was found not only to be possible and robust but , for a broad range of the parameters ( density , viscosity , etc ) , often enhanced when compared to the strongly viscous ( no mobility ) case .",

    "another relevant question regards the existence of any fundamental difference between those games when mobility is introduced .",
    "in particular , in those cases where the spatial structure is known to inhibit cooperation  @xcite , does mobility change this picture ?",
    "our objective here is to present a more comprehensive analysis and extend our previous study in several directions , trying to shed some light on the above questions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the following section describes the details of the model and simulation .",
    "then , we present the results for two possible implementations depending on the order of the diffusive and offspring steps . finally , we present our conclusions and discuss some implications of the results .",
    "the model is a two dimensional stochastic cellular automaton in which cells are either occupied by unconditional players ( cooperators or not ) or vacant . at time @xmath19 , the variable @xmath20 is 0 if the corresponding lattice cell is empty , or @xmath21 depending on whether the agent at that site cooperates ( 1 ) or defects ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the relevant quantity is the normalized fraction of cooperators , @xmath23 , after the stationary state is attained , defined as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the `` magnetization '' @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the system size and @xmath28 is the fraction of occupied sites , that is kept fixed at all times ( when @xmath29 , we call the system diluted ) .",
    "the symbol @xmath30 stands for an average over the ensemble of initial configurations .",
    "we call `` active '' a site that has changed strategy since the previous step . at each time step , all individuals play against all its four nearest neighbors ( if present ) , collecting the payoff from the combats . after that",
    ", it may either move or try to generate its offspring .",
    "we consider a best - takes - all reproduction : each player compares its total payoff with those of its nearest neighbors and changes strategy following the one ( including itself ) with the greatest payoff among them .",
    "this strategy changing updating rule preserves the total number of individuals , thus keeping @xmath31 constant .",
    "if a tie among some of the neighbors occurs , one of them is randomly chosen . during the diffusive part",
    ", each agent makes an attempt to jump to a nearest neighbor site chosen randomly , that is accepted , provided the site is empty , with a probability given by the mobility parameter @xmath32 . notice that @xmath32 does not measure the effective mobility , that depends on both @xmath32 and @xmath31 , but only a tendency to move , space allowing",
    ". however , different combinations of both parameters could give the same effective mobility ( measured , for example , through the mean square displacement ) , but that parameter alone would not suffice to characterize the game , since spatial correlations are determined by @xmath31 . among the several ways of implementing the reproductive and diffusive steps ,",
    "here we consider two possibilities , named contest - offspring - diffusion ( cod ) and contest - diffusion - offspring ( cdo ) . in the former ,",
    "as the name says , each step consists of combats followed by the generation of offspring done in parallel , and then diffusion , while in the latter , the diffusion and offspring steps are reversed .",
    "of course , the stochasticity introduced by the mobility disappears under some conditions ( e.g. , @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) , and the final outcome may now depend on the initial conditions .",
    "we explore many choices of the payoff parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 while @xmath2 and @xmath1 are kept fixed at 0 and 1 , respectively , and compare the effects of diffusion with those obtained either for the related spatial weak version  @xcite or for the randomly mixed limit .",
    "square lattices of sizes ranging from @xmath35 to @xmath36 with periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "averages are performed over at least 100 samples and equilibrium is usually attained before 1000 network sweeps are completed , although in some cases not even @xmath37 sweeps are enough to bring the system to an equilibrium fixed point .",
    "the initial configuration has @xmath38 individuals placed randomly on the lattice , equally distributed among cooperators and defectors .",

    "@xcite considered only the weak limit @xmath43 of the pd game for @xmath39 and @xmath5 , that is , inside the region where , for @xmath33 , both strategies coexist along with active sites .",

    ".  [ fig.cod_rhoc2 ] exactly superposes with the results for all values of @xmath4 in the aforementioned interval , @xmath15 included .",
    "this can be more clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.cod_s ] , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath4 are varied , and a plateau in the interval @xmath45  @xcite is observed ( although the value of @xmath23 in the plateau depends on both @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "besides this active phase , the system presents a large number of different phases , with sharp transitions between them . for comparison , the no mobility case  @xcite , @xmath34 ,",
    "is also included , as well as the cooperators density when @xmath33 ( solid black line ) .",
    "the transition points , calculated considering the several possible local neighborhoods  @xcite , are represented by vertical dashed and dotted lines located at the points where @xmath4 equals to @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "in addition to these transitions , a few more are introduced when the system is diluted ( vertical dotted lines ) , @xmath53 , each phase being characterized by the fraction of cooperators and by the way they organize spatially  @xcite . when mobility is introduced after the offspring generation ( cod dynamics )",
    ", no new transition appears . dilution ( without mobility ) allows cooperation for small values of @xmath4 ( @xmath54 ) , which is absent with @xmath33 . for low densities in particular ,",
    "clusters are small and isolated ; therefore , depending on the initial condition , cooperators succeed in forming pure clusters .",
    "however , as soon as mobility is introduced , this disorder driven phase disappears since small cooperative clusters are easily predated by wandering defectors . in this low density situation ,",
    "cooperation is only sustained when the exploitation is not too strong ( larger values of @xmath4 ) , as can be seen in the case @xmath55 and @xmath42 , where cooperation exists only for @xmath56 . for intermediate densities ,",
    "some phases may coalesce , like the large @xmath4 region for @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "interestingly , mobility has a non trivial effect in the negative response that is already present at @xmath33 or @xmath34 . when the sucker s payoff @xmath4 increases ( less exploitation ) , one expects higher levels of cooperation . but the opposite behavior is sometimes observed , and the number of cooperators may also decrease .",
    "an example occurs when @xmath33 as @xmath4 increases beyond the transition point 0.6 , and @xmath23 attains a new plateau , far below the previous one .",
    "however , with mobility such effect may be enhanced , attenuated or reverted .",
    "[ fig.cod_s ] depicts many examples of such behavior .",
    "moreover , for a fixed @xmath31 , mobility affects different phases in diverse ways .",
    "for example , for @xmath57 , when @xmath32 changes from 0.1 to 0.5 , the cooperative phase at @xmath59 disappears , while the one for @xmath60 suffers no alteration .",
    "when @xmath42 , instead , this region splits into five smaller regions .",
    "therefore , whether large or small mobility is better for cooperators strongly depends on both @xmath32 and @xmath31 .",
    "for example , for @xmath61 , @xmath23 increases with @xmath32 when @xmath4 is large and decreases for smaller values .",
    "the behavior of @xmath23 as a function of the mobility is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.cod_m ] . in some cases cooperation is an increasing function of the mobility and the optimal value is thus @xmath42 . on the other hand , it may also be detrimental for cooperation , and @xmath23 steadily decreases with @xmath32 . in this latter case",
    ", a non zero but very small mobility gives the optimal value .",
    "the most important result is obtained when we compare the simulations with what one would obtain in a large randomly mixed population .",
    "a simple mean field  @xcite argument leads to three possible solutions : two absorbing states , @xmath62 and 1 , and a mixed case with @xmath63 where we have already considered @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath4 and @xmath3 , one of these solutions may become the stable one . in the mean - field pd case",

    "the solution given by eq .",
    "[ eq.mf ] , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.cod_s ] as a curved line , is only stable in the sd game .",

    "nevertheless , when both dilution and mobility are introduced , cooperation is not so often inhibited . indeed , in fig .",
    "[ fig.cod_s ] one can see that in many cases the spatially distributed population outperforms the randomly mixed population in terms of cooperative behavior .     for mobilities @xmath34 ( top ) and @xmath42 ( bottom ) , @xmath6 , @xmath5 , @xmath66 and several values of @xmath4 with cod dynamics for the sh game .",

    "isolated clusters of cooperators are able to survive and even at very low densities cooperation is sustained .",

    "is strongly enhanced and @xmath58 for all values of @xmath13 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that mobility also changes the dependence on the density : with @xmath42 all curves are monotonically increasing functions of @xmath31 , while for @xmath34 they are always decreasing for low @xmath4 and non - monotonic for larger values .",

    "[ fig.cdo_s ] .",
    "cooperators close to defectors have low payoff ; therefore , if they do not move , in the next step their strategy will be replaced by d. on the other hand , if they do move away , there is a probability of surviving depending on the new neighborhood they encounter ( at low densities , for example , they may be isolated after the move , and thus survive ) .",
    "moreover , cooperators that detach from a cooperative neighborhood have high payoff and may replace the defectors they find .",
    "indeed , for many values of the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 , cooperators fully dominate the system , even in the region of small @xmath4 values where the cod dynamics allows no cooperators to survive . while all phases appearing in the cod dynamics were already present when @xmath34 , in the cdo case a few new phases appear .",
    "these mobility driven transitions can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.cdo_s ] and are marked by solid vertical lines at @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath22 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and 0 .",
    "in particular , a new transition appears at @xmath15 and , differently from all other cases where the weak pd behavior was representative of a wide range of values of @xmath4 , in this case , although the weak and the strict pd ( @xmath18 ) still behave in the same way , the small-@xmath4 sd becomes different .",
    "even though the density of the two phases is very similar , they are in fact different since the final configurations are slightly different even if we prepare two systems ( for example , one with @xmath73 and the other with @xmath74 ) with identical initial conditions and subject to the same sequence of random numbers .",
    "the main question posed at the beginning was how mobility affects the outcome of different games beyond the weak dilemma at the frontier between the pd and the sd studied in ref .",
    "a main novelty emerges in the context of the sd game : mobility restores the enhancing factor of the spatial structure also found in the pd game , at variance with the @xmath34 case where cooperation is usually lower than the fully mixed case  @xcite . in general , when agents are able to randomly diffuse on the lattice , unmatched levels of cooperation can be attained for wide ranges of the parameters .",
    "moreover , differently from the pd and sh games , the spatial sd presents negative responses when the value of @xmath4 increases : instead of enhancing the amount of cooperation as one would expect , @xmath23 sometimes decreases .",
    "this effect , absent in the fully mixed case , is also observed even in the absence of mobility , something that has not been previously noticed .",
    "cooperators are spatially organized in different ways depending on the game they play .",
    "for example , the clusters may be more compact or filamentous .",
    "this spatial structure rules the effect that mobility has on the fate of the game .",
    "we considered three regions of interest in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 plane , the genuine prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) game ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , the snowdrift ( sd ) game ( @xmath12 and @xmath14 ) and the stag hunt ( sh ) game ( @xmath17 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "let us analyze what happens for each of the three games separately .",
    "we start with the genuine pd where qualitative differences with respect to the weak dilemma occur only for values of @xmath4 below a threshold @xmath75 , a region in which cooperation is completely extinguished in the presence of mobility .",
    "this is reasonable since by increasing the penalization for the sucker s behavior ( decreasing @xmath4 ) one finally reaches a point below which c agents perform badly and can not overcome the filter of selection . for the cod variant at @xmath39 , @xmath76 no matter the density @xmath31 and for all @xmath77 considered .",
    "on the other hand , for the cdo variant , @xmath75 depends strongly on @xmath31 .",
    "it is remarkable that , even for very severe sucker s penalizations ( down to @xmath78 in the figure , but whatever smaller value will do , and since there is no further transition below @xmath69 , even any negativelly large one ) , for intermediate values of @xmath31 ( e.g. @xmath79 ) , the universal cooperation state ( @xmath58 ) , or a state very close to that , can still be attained .    in less severe dilemmas than the pd",
    " mutual defection pays less than the sucker s payoff in the sd , and mutual cooperation pays more than cheating in the sh  cooperation is , as one would have expected , in general higher . in the case of the sd , cooperation is often enhanced with respect to the weak dilemma with cod dynamics , while an unprecedented state of universal cooperation ( @xmath58 ) can be sometimes reached with the cdo one .",
    "hauert and doebeli  @xcite noticed that cooperation is often inhibited by spatial structure with @xmath23 being usually lower than its value in a randomly mixed population , where for large systems one of the three solutions @xmath80 , 0 or 1 is stable .",
    "dilution and mobility change dramatically this scenario .",
    "when only dilution ( but no mobility ) is present , cooperation in a spatially distributed system is higher than in the random mixed limit either for intermediate densities or small values of @xmath4 .",
    "when mobility is added , only high densities follow the behavior of the @xmath81 situation where spatial structure inhibits cooperation . on the contrary , for not so high densities cooperation is enhanced in the sd game when @xmath67 . in this way , in the presence of mobile agents , it is again possible to make the statement that spatial structure promotes cooperation . in the cod sh",
    ", the combination of mobility and large density ( @xmath82 ) leads to a boost in @xmath23 or even to universal cooperation .",
    "on the other hand , for smaller values of @xmath31 , provided the sucker s",
    "payoff @xmath4 is also small , @xmath23 is lower .",
    "so a crucial difference is that , for a given mobility , the level of cooperation grows with the density of agents , different from the behavior at @xmath34 .",
    "accessing the actual payoff involved in real situations is not an easy task , and it has been suggested that many examples that have been interpreted as realizations of the pd are also compatible with the sd and the sh games ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to this , mobility effects on the cooperation of real organisms are still largely unknown , as they are difficult to isolate from other factors and , as the theoretical results presented here have shown , even a tiny amount of mobility is able to produce very strong changes in the final result .",
    "although mobility may have an effect similar to noise , allowing shallow basins to be avoided , they are not equivalent . for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , several different dynamics , with and without noise , gave consistent results for the inhibition of cooperation in the sd game with spatial structure , while mobility drastically changes this outcome .",
    "since the results seem to strongly depend on the chosen dynamics ( although we have only considered `` best - takes - over '' updatings , it has two possible variants , cdo and cod ) , an important , yet open , question concerns the existence of an unifying principle , in hamilton s sense  @xcite , relating the parameters of the game , that tells us when cooperative behavior might be expected when mobile agents are present .",
