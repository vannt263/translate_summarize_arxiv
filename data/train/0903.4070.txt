    "_ @xcite ( abbreviated as vfw ) claimed that there was a contradiction between two results concerning the putative accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "their reasoning was , in brief , this ( italics mark quotations ) : on the one hand , hirata and seljak @xcite ( abbreviated as hs ) claimed to have proved that in a perfect fluid cosmological model that is geodesic , rotation - free and obeys the strong energy condition @xmath5 , a certain generalisation of the deceleration parameter @xmath6 must be non - negative .",
    "but on the other hand , iguchi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( hereafter inn ) did obtain simulated acceleration in lematre ",
    "tolman ( l  t ) models @xcite with @xmath7 that obey hs s conditions .",
    "this _ contradiction _ is resolved by showing that l ",
    "t models that simulate accelerated expansion also contain a _ weak singularity _ , and in this case the derivation of hs breaks down .",
    "in addition to this , there are _ other singularities that tend to arise _ in l ",
    "t models , and vfw _ have failed to find any singularity - free models that agree with observations .",
    "_    this leaves the impression that physically acceptable inhomogeneous models are unable to account for observations .",
    "it is shown here that this reasoning is not correct . in brief , our theses are the following :    \\1 .",
    "of the five definitions of the deceleration parameter given by hs , only @xmath0 is a correct invariant measure of deceleration of fluid expansion .",
    "their @xmath3 derives from a taylor expansion of the luminosity distance ",
    "redshift relation , @xmath8 , in powers of @xmath9 , done separately for each direction .",
    "their @xmath2 is based on the angular average of a taylor expansion of @xmath10 , and is conceptually different from what is done in observational practice .",
    "although all these definitions reduce to the familiar @xmath6 in flrw models , they have different values and distinct meanings in an inhomogeneous model .",
    "in particular @xmath3 and @xmath2 are not measures of deceleration in an inhomogeneous model .",
    "hs s @xmath2 does not correctly represent the observers deceleration parameter @xmath6 .",
    "when observers assume that our real universe is in the flrw class , @xmath6 is the same in all directions .",
    "but when they consider inhomogeneous and anisotropic models , they have to measure the distance ",
    "redshift relation for each direction separately rather than average the measured results over directions , as this would mean destroying useful information .",
    "thus , hs s @xmath2 that represents the result of such averaging does not correspond to the observations actually done in relation to this quantity .",
    "hs s reasoning is correct ( in the approximate sense ) up to their eq .",
    "( 31 ) , which allows one to calculate @xmath3 at the centre of symmetry in a lematre  tolman ( l  t ) model .",
    "but , at a spherical centre , the final result is the opposite to what they intended  no limitation on the sign of @xmath11 follows ( see our secs .",
    "[ hsproblems ] and [ fproblems ] ) .",
    "thus , there is no contradiction involved in a decelerating inhomogeneous model imitating observational relations of an accelerating flrw model .",
    "even so , it is incorrect to use an approximate equation to decide whether some quantity is positive or negative .",
    "what vfw call a _ weak singularity _ is not a singulalrity .",
    "it is also not true that _ other singularities _ invalidate the l ",
    "the differential equations for the _ inverse problem _  given observational data functions , calculate the lt model that would give them  are indeed singular at the apparent horizon .",
    "vfw refer to this location as a _ critical point _ , and to this phenomenon as a _ pathology_. in truth , this is simply the reconvergence of the observer s past null cone towards the big bang , that is a consequence of the decelerating cosmic expansion when lambda is zero , long known in the flrw case , e.g @xcite . though some authors ( inn and vfw among them ) were unable to propagate their solutions through the ` critical point ' , this difficulty was overcome by lu and hellaby @xcite and in fact the ah relation was used to provide extra information by mcclure and hellaby @xcite .",
    "since these misunderstandings have propagated into the literature , it is essential to resolve these issues .",
    "but the most important point to be stressed is this : what one wants to reproduce , in connection with the distant type ia supernovae , is not the accelerated expansion of the universe , but the observed luminosity distance ",
    "redshift relation .",
    "the apparent dimming of supernovae ( first reported by riess _",
    "_ @xcite and perlmutter _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) stems from a comparison between observations and the einstein - de sitter model , the ` old ' standard model of the universe .",
    "the first proposed explanation , originating from the assumption that the universe should be friedmannian , is an accelerated expansion .",
    "however , this acceleration is not the phenomenon to be explained , but a component of a particular explanation  one that assumes homogeneity on the scale in question .",
    "since in the following we often refer to the l  t model , we summarise here the basic facts about it in the case @xmath7 . for more extended expositions see refs .",
    "the metric of the l ",
    "t model is : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an arbitrary function , and @xmath14 is determined by the integral of the einstein equations : @xmath15 @xmath16 being another arbitrary function .",
    "equation ( [ 2.2 ] ) has the same algebraic form as one of the well - known friedmann equations , except that here it contains arbitrary functions of @xmath17 in place of arbitrary constants .",
    "the friedmann limit follows when @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the corresponding friedmann constants and scale factor .",
    "the solution of ( [ 2.2 ] ) may be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is one more arbitrary function called the bang - time function ; in the friedmann limit it is constant .",
    "the @xmath25 sign applies for an expanding region , @xmath26 applies for a collapsing region .",
    "the mass density is    @xmath27    the pressure is zero , and so the matter ( dust ) particles move on geodesics .",
    "the equations determining the l  t model are covariant with the transformations @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , we may use such a transformation to give one of the functions @xmath29 a handpicked form , provided the chosen function is monotonic in the range under investigation .",
    "an incoming radial null geodesic is given by the differential equation @xmath30 and its solution is denoted @xmath31 .",
    "the general solution determines the past null cone ( pnc ) of the observer situated at the centre of symmetry .",
    "we use the hat @xmath32 and the subscript @xmath33 to indicate evaluation on the pnc",
    ". then the redshift along the pnc , @xmath34 , is given by @xcite : @xmath35_\\wedge ~,\\ ] ] and the area and luminosity distances are @xmath36 equations ( [ 2.5 ] ) and ( [ 2.6 ] ) can be solved numerically once @xmath16 , @xmath13 and @xmath24 are specified .",
    "t model may possibly have a curvature singularity at the centre of symmetry .",
    "the singularity will be absent when there is no point mass there , and the mass density is finite .",
    "this will happen when the conditions given below are obeyed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the derivation ) .",
    "let @xmath37 be the radial coordinate of the centre of symmetry , where @xmath38 for all @xmath39 , and let @xmath40 .",
    "we choose the @xmath17-coordinate so that @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 constant",
    ". then , in a neighbourhood of @xmath44 , the functions behave as follows : @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 being constants , where the symbols @xmath48 will denote quantities with the property @xmath49",
    "hirata and seljak @xcite give in their paper five alternative definitions of the deceleration parameter , three of which we briefly recall here for reference . in all cases",
    "it is assumed that the spacetime is filled with a perfect fluid obeying einstein s equations with zero cosmological constant .",
    "hs assume that the fluid moves geodesically , but for the beginning we shall drop this assumption .",
    "their first definition of the deceleration parameter is : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the ( local ) hubble parameter and @xmath52 is the velocity field of the fluid .",
    "then , using these definitions , the raychaudhuri equation may be rewritten as follows : @xmath53 + \\frac { 4 \\pi g } 3 ( \\rho + 3p),\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the acceleration of the fluid , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the shear and rotation tensors , respectively , @xmath57 is the mass density and @xmath58 is the pressure .",
    "it follows that with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath0 must be non - negative .",
    "this result applies in particular to the l ",
    "t models ( where @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) and to the flrw models ( where @xmath63 ) .",
    "the definition ( [ 3.1 ] ) is invariant , applies in all geometries , is a generalization of the deceleration parameter long used in the flrw geometries , and measures the relative change of the expansion scalar along the flow lines of the perfect fluid . with @xmath64 we have @xmath65 , so the expansion slows down toward the future of the comoving observers .",
    "this is the case in all cosmological models that obey the assumptions listed above .",
    "the quantities @xmath3 and @xmath66 refer to a taylor expansion of the luminosity distance - redshift relation @xmath10 : @xmath67 where @xmath66 and @xmath3 are functions of the angle of observation .",
    "the definitions of @xmath68 and @xmath2 follow by averaging ( [ 3.3 ] ) over the full solid angle @xmath69 at each fixed @xmath70 : @xmath71 these equations have the same algebraic form as the corresponding equation in an flrw model .",
    "by considering a bundle of null geodesics converging to a point in space , hirata and seljak @xcite derived an equation relating the quantities in ( [ 3.4 ] ) to the invariants of flow of a perfect fluid filling the spacetime .",
    "flanagan s ( hereafter f , @xcite ) equation is more general , and it reads , in hs s notation , @xmath72.\\ ] ] ( hs s result is the subcase @xmath73 . )    equation ( [ 4.1 ] ) has the appearance of being exact and covariant .",
    "unfortunately , it is neither .",
    "as we show below , its derivations , both by hs and by flanagan , contain approximations ( some not explicitly spelled out ) and involve averaging over directions , which produces coordinate - dependent results at locations corresponding to coordinate singularities .",
    "approximations may be good for some purposes , but not when one intends to show that some quantity is positive .",
    "below we note instances where hs and f introduced approximations in their reasoning .      we have no objections to the reasoning of hs up to their eq .",
    "having established the relation between the luminosity distance @xmath70 and the redshift @xmath9 ( their ( 24 ) ) , and between the radiation amplitude and the expansion scalar @xmath74 of the radiation field ( their ( 25 ) ) , hs then copy a relation between @xmath74 ( @xmath75 in hs s notation ) and the affine parameter @xmath76 from ref .",
    "@xcite ( hs s eq . ( 26 ) ) .",
    "this requires a comment .    to obtain this relation",
    "one considers another family of rays , originating at the centre of a source ( call it a star for brevity ) .",
    "the star is assumed spherical and having the radius @xmath77 .",
    "one of the rays hits the observer .",
    "the values of the affine parameter along this ray are @xmath78 at the observer , @xmath79 at the surface of the star and @xmath80 at the centre of the star .",
    "the relation is then @xmath81.\\ ] ] in ref .",
    "@xcite this is obtained as an approximate solution of the raychaudhuri equation for null geodesics , which is @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are , respectively , the expansion , shear and rotation of the null congruence @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the ricci tensor in spacetime .    equation ( [ 4.2 ] ) without the second term on the right is the exact solution of ( [ 4.3 ] ) in the case @xmath88 .",
    "thus the approximation involved in ( [ 4.2 ] ) is that the contributions to @xmath89 from shear , rotation and lensing by matter are negligible compared to @xmath90 .",
    "these are additional assumptions about light propagation in spacetime ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 negligible ) and about the spacetime itself ( @xmath91 negligible ) .",
    "however , hs s ( 38 ) is used by vfw as if it were exact . when @xmath92 hold exactly , the goldberg ",
    "sachs theorem @xcite applies , which says that the spacetime must be algebraically special , with @xmath93 being the double principal null congruence of the weyl tensor .",
    "the assumption @xmath94 , when imposed on the l ",
    "t spacetime , reduces it to the schwarzschild solution .",
    "therefore , hs s equation ( 38 ) , when treated as exact , involves strong assumptions that do nt apply to the l ",
    "t model , or even the flrw model .",
    "the two errors shown below have no meaning for the final result because ( in the approximation in which hs worked ) they cancelled out in the end , but they might be confusing . hs s equation ( 27 ) should actually read @xmath95 i.e. it is the inverse of what they wrote . similarly",
    ", their equation ( 28 ) should actually read @xmath96 ( where @xmath97 is the radiation amplitude ) , i.e. again the inverse of their result . since hs assumed @xmath98 , the above",
    "is approximately equal to @xmath99 which results in hs s eqs .",

    "since we will later refer to their ( 31 ) , we copy it here : @xmath100 the meaning of the symbols in ( [ 4.7 ] ) is as follows .",
    "since hs work under the assumption that @xmath101 for the cosmic fluid , comoving and synchronous coordinates exist in which the metric @xmath102 has the properties @xmath103 , @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the time coordinate and @xmath106 , @xmath107 , are the space coordinates .",

    "flanagan s paper @xcite addressed the question of whether superhorizon perturbations can cause apparent acceleration .",
    "he concluded that if their effect on @xmath6 is negative , it must be too small to _ be responsible for the acceleration of the universe . _",

    "( 9 ) is : @xmath181 the meaning of the symbols is as follows : @xmath182 is the set of coordinates of the observer at the point @xmath183 , @xmath184 is the set of coordinates of the light source at the point @xmath185 , @xmath186 is the four - velocity of the cosmic medium at @xmath183 ( the observer is comoving ) , @xmath187 is the four - velocity of the medium parallel - transported from @xmath185 to @xmath183 along the light ray , @xmath188 is synge s @xcite world function for @xmath183 and @xmath185 , and the coefficients are @xmath189 , @xmath190 .    the quantity in ( [ 6.1 ] )",

    "nevertheless , it is easy to verify that ( [ 6.2 ] ) is equal to the usual formula .",

    "however the fractional differences are of order @xmath213 , which we have argued above is of order @xmath214 and is small .",
    "_    this is correct in the context of his paper .",

    "more important , however , is the fact that vfw do not try to find an l ",

    "vfw write as if flrw models are known to solve the _",

    "what is usually done is to solve the fitting problem : choose your favorite type of cosmological metric and find the free functions and parameters that make it best fit the data .",

    "at least two of these misunderstandings are widespread and therefore it is worth putting the record straight .",
    "the first error - correction to be made is that a conical density profile at the origin is not a singularity in any accepted sense , and there are no physical problems associated with it . in some situations",
    "a conical profile may be a good model of structures that are strongly centrally concentrated .    secondly , critical points in the inverse problem are generic . when solving the ` inverse problem ' as defined in sec .",
    "[ trcrgen ] for a realistic l  t or flrw model , and finding that the differential equations diverge at some redshift , one must be aware that this is an inevitable consequence of the apparent horizon , where the diameter distance is maximum .",
    "the chances that real observational data _ exactly _ satisfy the full transcriticality conditions for any given model , homogeneous or not , are essentially zero .",
    "such divergent behaviour does not indicate any physical problem with the underlying l  t or flrw model , and transcritical solutions in a variety of models that closely reproduce the observed @xmath8 do exist .",
    "actually this point seems not to be well understood and other examples of this misunderstanding can be found in the literature ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our point three is that one should be careful when extending flrw definitions of some functions to other cosmological models . in most such cases ,",
    "when inhomogeneities are present , the flrw parameters do not mean the same thing as in the homogeneous case .",
    "it is very common to get acceleration and supernova dimming mixed up .",
    "the interpretation of the supernova dimming as an accelerated expansion ( which is due to the use of flrw models ) has firmly taken root , which is why some have focussed on acceleration in the fluid expansion . in the l ",
    "t models , the ` acceleration ' defined from @xmath10 using ( [ 3.3 ] ) exhibits a behaviour different from the @xmath0 of the fluid flow defined by ( [ 2.1 ] ) , even though they coincide for flrw models .",
