    "the hubble deep field ( williams et al .  1996 ; hdfn ) presented the deepest view of the universe in what is now the best studied 5 square arcminutes of the sky . with the addition of the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( woodgate et al .",
    "1998 ; stis ) and the near infrared camera and multiobject spectrometer ( thompson et al . 1998 ; nicmos ) , the opportunity was presented to expand on the hdf program with an ambitious observation of the field around the z=2.25 qso j2233 - 6033 ( boyle 1997 ) .",
    "this hubble deep field south ( williams et al .  2000 ; hdfs ) provided a spectroscopic investigation of the matter along the line of sight to the qso ( ferguson et al .",
    "2000 ) , the deepest image ever taken at optical wavelengths ( gardner et al .",
    "2000 ) , and deep optical and ir images of parallel fields ( casertano et al .",

    "september , we obtained broad - band @xmath0 imaging of half of a square degree around the hdfs .",
    "we have cataloged over 40,000 galaxies .",
    "the first results from the project ( palunas et al .  2000a , hereafter paper i ) were a study of qsos in this field . here",
    "we present a measurement of the evolution of large - scale structure in the universe , using the angular correlations of galaxies as a function of photometric redshifts determined from our multi - color data .",

    "galaxy clustering traces overdense regions in the distribution of dark matter .",
    "high - redshift galaxies occur at the most extreme peaks in the density field and are thus biased tracers of mass  i.e .",
    ", luminous matter is more strongly clustered than dark matter ( kaiser 1984 ) .",
    "subsequently , the clustering of the dark matter increases more rapidly than that of galaxies , so that the two distributions approach one another and are more similar today than in the past .",
    "in other words , the galaxy clustering bias is less .",
    "the way in which the bias decreases is a function of the cosmological parameters @xmath10  and @xmath11  ( e.g. kauffman et al . 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , by measuring the evolution of the galaxy - galaxy correlation function , we can constrain models of structure formation .",
    "clustering has often been estimated from catalogues of two - dimensional sky coordinates of galaxies in order to infer the three - dimensional , physical correlation function , @xmath12 , using limber s equation ( e.g. , peebles 1980 ) .",
    "an important recent study of this type is the apm galaxy survey ( maddox et al .",
    "1996 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "spectroscopic surveys have allowed direct measurement of @xmath12  for local galaxies over a wide field ( e.g. lin et al .",
    "studies at high redshift have had to rely on pencil - beam redshift surveys ( e.g. giavalisco et al .",
    "1998 ) or wide - field photometric surveys in a single filter ( postman et al .",
    "photometric redshifts now make it possible to combine the best of both techniques . while not accurate enough to determine @xmath12 , they are sufficient to assign the galaxies to redshift bins and study the evolution of  with redshift directly , rather than inferring the evolution from varying the magnitude limit ( connolly , szalay , & brunner 1998 ; arnouts et al .",
    "1999 ; brunner , szalay , & connolly 2000 ) . we have used this method to trace the evolution of clustering to z=1 .    in section 2 , we summarize the observations and data reduction . in section 3",

    "we present our conclusions in section 6 . unless otherwise noted , a cosmology of @xmath13 km s@xmath14  mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16  is assumed .",
    "we obtained @xmath0  imaging using the big throughput camera ( wittman et al .",
    "1998 ; btc ) on the blanco 4-m telescope at ctio .",
    "observations were taken over three nights , 1998 september 16 - 18 .",
    "integration times and seeing conditions are listed in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the btc consists of four 2048@xmath172048 pixel ccds spaced in a grid , with a plate scale of 0.43/pixel .",
    "there are 5.4 wide gaps between the detectors , so it is necessary to observe in a dithered - grid pattern .",
    "the telescope was pointed at a grid of positions designed to fill in the gaps while maximizing the exposure time on a region around the hdfs quasar .",
    "we used 4 main positions spaced by 11.5 . at each position ,",
    "small offsets were made ( @xmath18 ) in order to measure the sky accurately in the object frames .",
    "the total area surveyed ( to varying signal - to - noise ratio , snr ) was 2116@xmath19 .",
    "initial data reduction is carried out using standard iraf procedures and btcproc , a pipeline reduction package for btc data ( wittman et al .",
    "the standard procedures include the usual ccd processing routines , such as bias subtraction , flat - fielding , and sky subtraction .",
    "the flat fields are created as `` super - flats '' from median combinations of all data taken throughout the night on a given chip in a given filter .",
    "the large format btc images have substantial optical distortions which affect the relative positions of objects , the plate scale , and the shapes of objects across the field of view .",
    "btcproc  is designed to correct these distortions .",
    "first , a smoothed sky frame is subtracted from each exposure ( after the usual flat - fielding , etc . ) .",
    "then , preliminary source catalogs for each image are created in btcproc using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "an initial geometric correction is applied to each catalog using an @xmath20-band astrometric solution provided by the btc team ( wittman 1999 ; private communication ) .",
    "the catalog photometry is also corrected for variations in the plate scale .",
    "all of the preliminary catalogs are then matched to a fiducial position , in our case to the first @xmath20-band exposure , and a new astrometric solution is calculated for each image .",
    "the solution for each image is parameterized with four two - dimensional , cubic polynomials , one for each chip .",
    "an additional correction for geometric distortion in the shapes of objects is calculated to circularize the point spread function of stars selected from the catalogs .",
    "the photometry from the initial catalogs is used to match the relative photometry between images and chips .",
    "distortion corrected images are registered and then scaled by the photometry of stars in common . finally , the registered , scaled images are combined by taking the median of each pixel value .",
    "the combined images are aligned ( shifted and rotated ) to j2000 coordinates , using astrometric observations of the hdfs field ( zacharias et al .",
    "we measure an rms positional error of 0.07 arcseconds ( 0.16 pixels ) in the astrometry of 223 stars .",
    "a final catalog is constructed , again using sextractor . in order to obtain color information through uniform apertures ,",
    "objects are identified in each band and then measured on the same pixels in the other bands . for objects with strong @xmath20-band detections , that aperture is adopted for the photometry of the object ; otherwise the highest snr band is allowed to define the object .",
    "the btc data are observed through the sloan @xmath21  filter , the johnson @xmath22  and @xmath23  filters , and the cousins @xmath20  and @xmath3  filters .",
    "we fix our photometric system to that used by landolt ( 1992 ) ; that is , johnson @xmath24  and cousins @xmath25 .",
    "the photometry is calibrated using observations of the landolt ( 1992 ) standard fields 95 and 113 .",
    "multiple stars are measured on each chip and photometric growth curves are constructed .",
    "comparison of the johnson and sloan @xmath21  filters demonstrates that small color corrections are sufficient to place our observations onto the same system as landolt .",
    "photometric errors are taken from the sextractor catalogs .",
    "for use in this paper , all photometric data are converted from counts to flux density , @xmath26 , using the photometric zeropoints provided by bessel ( 1990 ) .",
    "star - galaxy separation is performed using the same method as in paper i. objects are classified based on their magnitude , fwhm , and sextractor s _ class _  parameter .",
    "objects brighter than @xmath27  are considered stars if they have @xmath28  in the @xmath20-band . for objects with @xmath29",
    ", stars are defined as objects with @xmath30  and _ _ class__@xmath31 . at faint magnitudes ( @xmath32 ) , objects with @xmath33  and _ _",
    "class__@xmath34  are classified as stars .",
    "the classification is limited by the poor seeing of the observations ( @xmath35  in the @xmath20-band ) ; however , the star - galaxy separation is verified by comparing our classifications to those in the wfpc2 flanking fields ( lucas et al . 2000 ) . for objects with @xmath36 , we find that the two data sets agree on the classification of 92%  of the objects detected .",
    "the number of objects classified as stars is within @xmath37%  of the prediction from galactic star counts ( bahcall & soneira 1981 ) .",
    "the catalog contains 53,657 objects with @xmath38 , of which 46,983 are classified as galaxies . for the photometric redshift analysis",
    ", we select the subset of the galaxies which are clearly detected ( @xmath39 ) in @xmath40  and either @xmath21  or @xmath3 , for a total of 29,023 galaxies .",
    "photometric redshifts have been successfully determined for many catalogs of galaxy photometry , most notably the hdfn observations ( see koo 1985 , brunner et al .",

    "1998 ) . the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a candidate galaxy",
    "is compared to a database of template spectra ; the best fit between the two is considered to give the photometric redshift . the idea , while simple , depends on the complicated question of choosing the proper template spectra .",
    "lanzetta et al .  (",
    "1996 ) have found that `` redshifting '' empirical spectra of four morphological types of local galaxies provides a sensitive means of fitting seds .",
    "the observed spectra adopted as input to their technique are those of coleman , wu & weedman ( 1980 ; hereafter cww ) .",
    "brunner et al .   ( 1997 ) prefer to use galaxy spectra actually measured at various redshifts as the template database .",
    "the limitation to that technique is the dearth of @xmath41  galaxy spectra available for comparison . finally , many groups ( e.g. giallongo et al .",
    "1998 ) have used the synthetic spectra of bruzual & charlot s gissel96 models ( see bruzual & charlot 1993 ) as templates .",
    "although the advantage to synthetic spectra is the inclusion of evolution in the galaxy spectra , lanzetta et al .   argue that evolution mostly has the effect of moving the sed from one galaxy type to another .",
    "we adopt the simplest of these approaches to fitting the photometric data .",
    "we compare the measured points to an `` augmented cww template set '' , constructed from the cww observed spectra and a single , bluer gissel96 model .",
    "the starburst model is taken from the gissel96 library with 0.5 gyr age , solar metallicity , and a salpeter imf .",
    "the cww spectra lack a blue starburst spectrum like the ones seen in ( e.g. ) the kinney et al .",
    "( 1993 ) library .",
    "we expect that the cww spectra will better represent evolved , low - redshift galaxies than the youngest high - redshift ones , which are often strikingly similar to low redshift starbursts ( see conti , leitherer & vacca 1996 ) .",
    "thus , we include cww spectra for the likely low - z objects and a gissel96 starburst model spectrum for the likely high - z ones .",
    "a similar approach is taken by gwyn et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , though they include more than one starburst . following the usual approach to template selection",
    ", we do not include any agn in the seds ( but see hatziminaoglou , mathes , & pello 2000 ) .",
    "the contamination by agn is expected to be very small . in 12-selected samples , which are significantly less biased against finding seyferts than our optically selected sample ,",
    "only @xmath42%  are spatially resolved agn ( rush , malkan , & spinoglio 1993 ) .",
    "we now review the specifics of our technique .",
    "for all the template spectra ,  is calculated over 102 redshifts .",
    "the redshift grid is evenly spaced in the square root of redshift .",
    "other authors choose linearly or logarithmically spaced redshift points ; however , we find that the square root is the best compromise to obtain sufficient coverage at both large and small redshifts .",
    "the @xmath43  test comparing the model seds to the observed photometric data is performed with the usual procedure . for each object observed , @xmath44 ^ 2 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath45  is the observed flux for each filter @xmath46 , with uncertainty @xmath47 , and @xmath48  is the flux predicted by the template model spectrum .",
    "the template fluxes are normalized to the observed data by a constant , @xmath49 , which is determined ( following giallongo et al .",
    "1998 ) to minimize @xmath43 , such that d@xmath50d@xmath51 : @xmath52       \\big/       \\sum_i \\left [ f_{t , i}^{2 } \\over { \\sigma^{2}}\\right]\\ ] ]    given the varying sensitivity between filters , many objects are not detected in one or more bands .",
    "this problem is particularly evident in the @xmath21-band data , given the difficulty of obtaining good @xmath21-band photometry from the ground . in cases where no object is detected in a given filter",
    ", we use the measured flux from the region where the object is detected in other filters .",
    "since our data are distortion corrected with a large set of astrometric positions , the registration should prevent this technique from introducing spuriously high flux from other objects ( splitting of faint objects in such cases is handled by sextractor ) .",
    "the hundreds of  values form a surface , where the independent variables are the redshift and the galaxy template and the dependent variable is @xmath53 , the reduced  ( see e.g. bevington 1969 ) .",
    "these surfaces typically contain 3 - 6 minima of varying depth .",
    "each minimum corresponds to a photometric redshift for the object being tested .",
    "the most likely inferred luminosity of each galaxy is favored : rather than simply eliminating the extreme solutions ( @xmath54  or @xmath55 ) , we form a weighting function , @xmath56 , by which we divide the @xmath53  values .",
    "this function takes the form of a schechter function ( thus values near @xmath57  are weighted highly , while the low luminosity end rolls off slowly , and the high luminosity end drops precipitously  see figure [ fig : zerr ] ) . specifically , @xmath58  and @xmath59 .",
    "this weighting function is not meant to represent the actual luminosity function of the galaxies , and no luminosity evolution is included .",
    "rather @xmath56  is used to discriminate between extremely different minima in the common sense way that would be applied if each -map were inspected by a person .",
    "cases are rare in which multiple minima of substantially different redshift fall in the most probable ( @xmath60 ) regime .",
    "accurate redshift estimation requires wavelength coverage of the strong spectral features .",
    "for example , at low redshifts the strongest feature is the 4000  break .",
    "however , at @xmath61  this break redshifts into the near - ir . as a result ,",
    "many surveys ( e.g. connolly et al .",
    "1997 ) have demonstrated the need for ir data to obtain accurate @xmath62  for the interesting @xmath63  era . at @xmath64",
    "the 912  lyman break redshifts into the blue end of the optical .",
    "the signal from this feature has led to the successful @xmath65- and @xmath22-band dropout technique ( e.g. steidel et al .",
    "1996 , madau et al .",
    "1996 ) of identifying lyman break galaxies ( hereafter lbgs ) and the use of photometric redshifts to identify galaxies at @xmath66  ( lanzetta 1999 ) .    in the case of the btc data presented in this paper",
    ", we have @xmath0  photometry for all galaxies in the catalog . as a result ,",
    "our analysis is limited to galaxies with @xmath67 , where our spectral coverage is sufficient to detect the characteristic features .    to calibrate the accuracy of our procedure",
    ", we have created catalogs of simulated observations .",
    "the basis for these simulations is the gissel96 models at a variety of ages , with solar metallicity .",
    "we expect that the dominant source of error in redshift recovery will be photometric noise , and so the effect of including non - solar metallicity input spectra to the simulations would be small .",
    "the gissel96 input spectra sample galaxies from e through sc as well as galaxies with strong starbursts . to obtain the simulated catalog , we randomly sample",
    "the distribution of spectroscopically measured redshifts for bright ( @xmath68 ) galaxies in the hdfn and redshift the input spectra .",
    "this distribution is estimated using a smooth function fit to the hdfn data which have large gaps at @xmath41 .",
    "since our data are not deep enough to detect @xmath21-band dropouts , we only model galaxies up to @xmath69 . simulated galaxies at @xmath70  have lyman forest blanketing applied using the decrements of madau ( 1995 ) .",
    "the redshifted spectra are scaled to a random sampling of hdfn @xmath3-band magnitudes , and random photometric error is added to each data point , within the expected error bars for our btc data . those objects with snr sufficient for detection",
    "are retained in the simulated catalog .",
    "figure [ fig : zsim residual ] shows the residual redshift error after applying our photometric redshift estimator to each simulated object .",
    "as expected , the @xmath41  regime is the most problematic for optical data , as the 4000  break redshifts into the near ir , while the lyman break is still in the ultraviolet .",
    "we find typical redshift errors at the 15 - 20% level for @xmath71 .",
    "however , a number of @xmath72  galaxies are mis - identified as lower redshift objects .",
    "table [ tab : z_mis_id ]  shows the proportion of misidentified objects in several redshift ranges .",
    "this effect would be greatly reduced by adding ir observations . in the table , we list contamination of each bin by objects in bins that are not adjacent ; that is , objects misidentified by the amount of the typical errors are not considered to be contamination , and some overlap at the boundaries of the bins is expected .",
    "we also apply our photometric redshift procedure to two catalogs of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies .",
    "the first is the current set of hdfn galaxies , as tabulated by fernandez - soto et al .",
    "figure [ fig : z hdfn ]  shows the comparison between our  estimator applied to the hdfn wfpc2 data and the spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "typical redshift residuals are @xmath73  for @xmath74 .",
    "the lower residuals with this data are the result of more precise photometry .",
    "the second spectroscopic data set is the catalog of aat spectra for galaxies around the hdfs ( glazebrook et al .",
    "2000 ; in preparation ) .",
    "more than 50 galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the objects in that catalog are in our field , so that a direct comparison with the btc photometric redshift results is possible .",
    "objects that are not resolved from neighbors or are severely contaminated from proximity to bright stars are discarded , leaving 31 galaxies . of these , 19 have redshifts that glazebrook et al .",
    "consider reliable ; i.e. , they have quality flags 3 or 4 which indicate greater than 50%  probability for the redshift .",
    "figure [ fig : z glazebrook ]  shows the comparison with our inferred redshifts .",
    "good agreement is found for most of the aat sample , since it is restricted to @xmath75 .",
    "also in figure [ fig : z glazebrook ] , we compare our photometric redshift for objects in the hdfs wfpc2 field to estimates made from the hst data by yahata et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and gwyn et al .",
    "those groups agree to within @xmath76  on the redshifts of @xmath77  galaxies in the wfpc2 field that we detect and resolve , and the comparison is made using those objects .",
    "agreement is found within the errors between our estimates and theirs .      for the galaxy catalog",
    ", we have calculated the error in the redshift inferred for individual objects .",
    "these individual errors will not be used in the clustering analysis presented in this paper , but may be of interest in future work .",
    "one common method of calculating the error on photometric redshift is to apply the standard @xmath78  statistic ( e.g. giallongo et al .",
    "1998 ) , i.e. , the error , @xmath79 , is calculated by measuring the width in redshift of the @xmath43  trough at the points where the value of @xmath80 .",
    "this statistic produces good estimates of the error in @xmath62  as long as the minimum value of  is close to unity .    for many galaxies in our catalog , however the value of @xmath81  is significantly greater or smaller than one .",
    "our simulations show that this is not an indication of insufficient resolution in the models ; nor is it the result of systematic photometric errors ( our extensive checks will be presented in paper iii ) .",
    "accordingly , we adapt the @xmath78  method to our data by normalizing our  maps such that @xmath82  before measuring the width of the @xmath78  trough . for galaxies having values of  near unity ,",
    "this reverts to the usual method .",
    "the values we obtain for @xmath79  are consistent with the errors measured in our simulations ( see table [ tab : z_mis_id ]  in section [ sec : zphot cal ] ) .",
    "as expected , @xmath79  roughly increases with redshift and with photometric error .",
    "figure [ fig : zhist ]  shows the number - redshift relation , @xmath4  for the photometric redshifts of the galaxies in our catalog .",
    "our result is compared to the distribution from yahata et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the hdfs .",
    "the distribution of inferred redshifts agrees fairly well , although they see a sharp peak at @xmath83  that is not present in our data .",
    "this may be the result of the small area over which their redshifts are estimated .",
    "glazebrook et al .",
    "( 2000 ; in preparation ) see evidence for a cluster at @xmath84  in the wfpc2 field .",
    "the estimates of @xmath4  by yahata et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are for a few hundred galaxies in the wfpc2 and nicmos fields , and so could be biased by such a cluster .",
    "we also compare to the counts for photometric redshifts in the hdfn ( fernandez - soto et al .",
    "1999 and the references therein ) , and the spectroscopic redshifts from the canada france redshift survey ( lilly et al .",
    "our number - redshift counts show a good agreement with both samples out to @xmath85 .",
    "the sample of galaxies for which we can fit redshifts is characterized by figure [ fig : pzmodel ] .",
    "no brightness cut apart from that implicit in the fitting procedure is applied .",
    "the top row of plots shows histograms of sed type in each redshift bin , and the bottom row shows the distribution of @xmath86  for each type .",
    "the distance modulus of each galaxy is computed using @xmath15 and @xmath87 .",
    "the absolute magnitude is k - corrected using the best - fit sed .",
    "also , a small correction is made for foreground extinction @xmath88 ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) . if the sed types are coded as successive integers , then the mean sed type , which is shown in the top row of plots as a short vertical line , moves very little between the @xmath89  ranges .",
    "fernandez - soto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) similarly find little evolution in the median galaxy type , although their type distribution is centered closer to the irregular galaxy model .",
    "as expected for a magnitude - limited sample , the objects at high redshift are intrinsically brighter than those at low redshift for a given sed type .",
    "thus , any derived quantities as a function of redshift may be affected by the implicit luminosity selection , and similarly for different apparent magnitude cuts . in the case of spatial correlation statistics ,",
    "such effects are called luminosity bias ( park et al .",
    "1994 , kauffmann et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in the highest - redshift bin ,",
    "the distribution of best - fit sed types is peaked in the neighborhood of the mean type .",
    "an apparent deficit of e / s0 galaxies is especially conspicuous .",
    "this effect likely results from the combination of two factors : spectral evolution and a selection bias .",
    "spectral evolution affects the distribution of sed types at @xmath2 because our small set of 5 sed templates is static , and each sed is labeled with the corresponding present - day galaxy type .",
    "thus a young , rather blue galaxy at @xmath90 that is fated to become a normal elliptical might be fit best by an sed appropriate to a present - day spiral .",
    "accordingly , we expect that evolution will be reflected in the choice of template , resulting in a deficit of apparent e / s0 sed types at higher redshift . for the hdf - north , using a template set similar to ours , fernandez - soto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find that significantly more galaxies are matched by the bluer templates at higher redshifts , though they still do find some galaxies to be classified as e / s0 .",
    "however , the hdf data include the near - infrared @xmath91 passbands , whereas we are limited to the optical",
    ".    selection bias may also affect the distribution of sed types . in order to fit a photometric redshift",
    ", we require a galaxy to be detected in at least 4 contiguous bands of the set @xmath0 . because the 4000   break at @xmath90  is longward of the peak response in @xmath20 , the rate of inclusion of red galaxies is expected to be less than that of blue galaxies .",
    "however , the sed type fitted for any galaxy in this redshift bin is also less meaningful than at lower redshifts because of relatively large photometric error in most of the bands . as a result",
    ", misclassification may contribute somewhat to the e / s0 deficit .",
    "the redshift itself is not affected either by this ambiguity or by sed evolution , since it relies primarily on the location of the 4000   break .",
    "our photometric redshift catalog can be used to examine the clustering evolution of galaxies at redshifts smaller than unity . with redshift uncertainties",
    "@xmath92 , physical clustering in three dimensions can not be evaluated directly ; instead , the angular correlation function is calculated for galaxies selected in redshift bins .",
    "one measure of galaxy clustering is the spatial two - point correlation function @xmath93 , which gives the excess probability of finding a galaxy at a given distance from another galaxy as compared to a uniformly random location .",

    "it is possible that the bias is less apparent at high redshift where the @xmath36  cutoff is not faint enough to include the intrinsically fainter ( less clustered ) galaxies .",
    "the apparent dearth of e / s0 galaxies in the highest - redshift bin ( figure [ fig : pzmodel ] ) suggests that this bin may also be affected by a morphological clustering bias , such as that seen in the local universe ( hermit et al .",
    "1996 ; santiago & strauss 1992 ; giovanelli , haynes , & chincarini 1986 ; davis & geller 1976 ) .",
    "the local bias is in the sense that early - type galaxies are more strongly clustered than late - type galaxies .",
    "hence , if the highest - redshift bin is biased in favor of luminous galaxies and against e / s0 galaxies , then a morphological and a luminosity bias may work in opposite directions .",
    "however , any morphological effect appears to be diluted by its involving only @xmath160 of the galaxies , if the distribution of morphologies is extrapolated from that at @xmath161 . in any case , the highest redshift bin is naturally the one most subject to any such systematic effects and most in need of additional observations .",
    "for the assumed cosmology and local clustering scales , the values of @xmath136  that we measure are best fit by @xmath8  among all the @xmath7  curves , though they are also marginally consistent with the @xmath162  case .",

    "moreover , the shape of both @xmath165  models is similar .",

    "most of the models shown in figure [ fig : acfvsz ]  ( @xmath165 , baugh et al . ) are no further than @xmath169 away from the data points , and so can not be ruled out by these data alone .",
    "by contrast , figure [ fig : awcompare ] , which shows a similar plot for flux - limited samples , suggests that @xmath116 is favored over the other models plotted .",
    "however , a detailed comparison between samples selected by photometric redshift and those selected solely by flux limit is probably not meaningful .",
    "the reason is that the clustering strength of the models is strongly affected by the integration over redshift ( the depth dimension ) via the assumed selection function @xmath145 . in turn , @xmath146 depends on the distribution of intrinsic galaxy luminosities and colors .",
    "although we assume a standard form of @xmath146 for each of our two samples defined solely by flux limit ( efstathiou et al .",
    "1991 ) , we have no independent check on the correctness of this assumption . similarly , the true selection function for each of our photometric - redshift bins is also uncertain , as noted previously .",
    "our results for the two types of galaxy selection are consistent in that catalog subsets dominated by the lower redshifts show stronger clustering than those dominated by the higher redshifts .",
    "the sample defined solely by @xmath159 ( figure [ fig : awcompare ] ) is more clustered than that defined solely by @xmath36 , and the sample defined by @xmath170 is more clustered than those with @xmath171 . furthermore , the selection functions adopted for integrating the clustering evolution models are at least roughly consistent with one another , since reasonable models yield correlation strengths in the range delineated by the observations for both types of catalog subsample .",
    "nevertheless , the primary purpose of fitting photometric redshifts is to be able to model @xmath145 for a given subsample in a way that is both straightforward and independent of intrinsic galaxy properties .",
    "if the random error in photometric redshift is well characterized , then the actual selection function of a given sample should be better determined with this method than with a simple apparent magnitude cutoff .",
    "accordingly , our expectation is that the model comparison in figure [ fig : acfvsz ]  is more robust than that in figure [ fig : awcompare ] , to within the error bars",
    ".    the ability of studies like this one to discriminate between models of clustering evolution can be improved by increasing either the photometric depth or the sky area .",
    "greater depth would provide a check for the present measurements both through improved photometry and through an extension of the redshift range .",
    "a greater sky area would improve the precision of the clustering amplitude by increasing the number of galaxy pairs at every redshift .",
    "our data are consistent with a popular scenario for the evolution of clustering with redshift .",
    "as we noted above , more data will help distinguish between these cases .",
    "kauffmann et al .  ( 1999 ) discuss the predictions of hierarchical cdm models on the observed clustering of galaxies .",
    "they explain that in a low density , @xmath9-dominated universe ( @xmath9cdm ) , there is a `` dip '' ( their phrasing ) in the amplitude of galaxy clustering around @xmath2 .",
    "this dip occurs between the era of strong dark matter clustering traced by unbiased luminous galaxies ( low redshift ) and the era in which the observable galaxies are highly biased tracers of the densest ( earliest clustered ) regions . in a high density universe ,",
    "the dip is absent , since structures form later and galaxies are more highly biased at higher redshifts ; in that case , the clustering strength is constant for @xmath74  and then rises sharply with redshift .",
    "cdm models also predict that the dip is weaker for redder , more luminous galaxies .",
    "arnouts et al .",
    "( 1999 ) demonstrate similar features in a wider array of cdm models , but with the same distinction between high density and low density universes . in our data , we find evidence for a decline out to @xmath2 , though the lack of higher redshift points prevents us from testing with our data alone whether this is a dip or an indication of a continuing decline .",
    "however , a reliable data point at @xmath172  from the lyman break galaxies ( giavalisco et al .",
    "1998 ) suggests that a dip must occur somewhere in the intervening redshift range .",
    "the strength of this effect is magnified by the fact that at higher redshifts we appear to be seeing blue galaxies , for which the dip is expected to be stronger .",
    "our data are consistent with @xmath9cdm predictions for a low density universe . although the strength of the evolution is debated , this scenario has been suggested by several studies ( e.g. postman et al .",

    "errors in @xmath173 are poissonian in the number of galaxy pairs in each @xmath103 bin ( peebles 1980 , landy & szalay 1993 ) ; however , because @xmath103  bins are correlated , the naive least - squares error in the weighted average of @xmath174 is incorrect . rather than trying to find the covariance matrix of all the @xmath103 bins , a typical approach is to use a resampling method .    in general",
    ", resampling is similar to monte carlo methods , in that error is computed using artificial data sets drawn by chance ; however , the data points are taken from the actual observations , rather than from an idealized model distribution .",
    "these samples are processed in the same way as the original data , and the standard deviation among all the answers is within a scale factor of the random error for the full observed data set .",

    "an analysis of the bootstrap for two - point correlation is given by snethlage ( 1999 ) , who finds that the resulting variances are too large .",
    "accordingly , we adopt an alternative resampling plan , based on the drawing of subsamples smaller than the original data set , without replacement ; this method is known technically as the _ delete-@xmath175 jackknife _ , where @xmath175 is the number of points omitted to form each subsample ( efron & tibshirani 1993 ) . the jackknife is known in general to be applicable to a wider range of problems than the bootstrap ( davison & hinkley 1997 ) . our argument for its use here is that each subsample represents a physically plausible distribution on the sky that is similar to the original , except sparser .",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath136 fitted from multiple subsamples of a given size is scaled to the full number of data points , @xmath126 , by multiplying by @xmath176 . in this case , @xmath177 is the number of galaxy _ pairs _ , so that the error is scaled by @xmath178 .",

    "one distinction between the two types of error is that the magnitude of systematic error can only be explored and not thoroughly characterized , whereas random error is a function of some reasonably well - understood distribution . assessing systematic error involves anticipating possible problems that are not seen clearly in the measurements ; for if the effects were well - defined , they could be corrected and relegated to the category of calibration .    like random error",
    ", systematic error is estimated through a repeated computation of the correlation strength ; however , in this case , the subsets of the original data are chosen deliberately rather than randomly .",
    "we take systematic error to be the result of additional structure imposed on the observed galaxy distribution by photometric non - uniformity .",
    "two mechanisms are considered : ( 1 ) the dithering and the mosaicking of data from several chips , which result in variation by a factor of a few in effective exposure over the image ; and ( 2 ) the possibility of insufficient masking around the 2 brightest stars , resulting in broad , low - amplitude clusters of noise spikes .",
