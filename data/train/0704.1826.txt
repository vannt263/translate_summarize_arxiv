    "apart from linking bosons with fermions and unifying internal and external ( space - time ) symmetries , susy allows for a stabilization of the gap between the planck and the electroweak scale and for gauge coupling unification at high energies .",
    "it appears naturally in string theories , includes gravity , and contains a stable lightest susy particle ( lsp ) as a dark matter candidate .",
    "spin partners of the sm particles have not yet been observed , and in order to remain a viable solution to the hierarchy problem , susy must be broken at low energy via soft mass terms in the lagrangian . as a consequence ,",
    "the susy particles must be massive in comparison to their sm counterparts , and the tevatron and the lhc will perform a conclusive search covering a wide range of masses up to the tev scale .",
    "if susy particles exist , they should also appear in virtual particle loops and affect low - energy and electroweak precision observables .",
    "in particular , flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , which appear only at the one - loop level even in the sm , put severe constraints on new physics contributions appearing at the same perturbative order .",
    "extended technicolour and many composite models have thus been ruled out , while the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) has passed these crucial tests .",
    "this is largely due to the assumption of constrained minimal flavour violation ( cmfv ) @xcite or minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) @xcite , where heavy susy particles may appear in the loops , but flavour changes are either neglected or completely dictated by the structure of the yukawa couplings and thus the ckm - matrix @xcite .",
    "the squark mass matrices @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are usually expressed in the super - ckm flavour basis @xcite . in mfv susy scenarios , their flavour violating non - diagonal entries @xmath3 , where @xmath4 refer to the helicity of the ( sm partner of the ) squark , stem from the trilinear yukawa couplings of the fermion and higgs supermultiplets and the resulting different renormalizations of the quark and squark mass matrices , which induce additional flavour violation at the weak scale through renormalization group running @xcite , while in cmfv scenarios , these flavour violating off - diagonal entries are simply neglected at both the susy - breaking and the weak scale .",
    "when susy is embedded in larger structures such as grand unified theories ( guts ) , new sources of flavour violation can appear @xcite .",
    "for example , local gauge symmetry allows for @xmath5-parity violating terms in the susy lagrangian , but these terms are today severely constrained by proton decay and collider searches . in non - minimal flavour violating ( nmfv )",
    "susy , additional sources of flavour violation are included in the mass matrices at the weak scale , and their flavour violating off - diagonal terms can not be simply deduced from the ckm matrix alone .",
    "nmfv is then conveniently parameterized in the super - ckm basis by considering them as free parameters .",
    "the scaling of these entries with the susy - breaking scale @xmath6 implies a hierarchy @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "squark mixing is expected to be largest for the second and third generations due to the large yukawa couplings involved @xcite .",
    "in addition , stringent experimental constraints for the first generation are imposed by precise measurements of @xmath8 mixing and first evidence of @xmath9 mixing @xcite .",
    "furthermore , direct searches of flavour violation depend on the possibility of flavour tagging , established experimentally only for heavy flavours .",
    "we therefore consider here only flavour mixings of second- and third - generation squarks .",
    "the direct search for susy particles constitutes a major physics goal of present ( tevatron ) and future ( lhc ) hadron colliders .",
    "susy particle hadroproduction and decay has therefore been studied in detail theoretically .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) susy - qcd calculations exist for the production of squarks and gluinos @xcite , sleptons @xcite , and gauginos @xcite as well as for their associated production @xcite .",
    "the production of top @xcite and bottom @xcite squarks with large helicity mixing has received particular attention . recently ,",
    "both qcd one - loop and electroweak tree - level contributions have been calculated for non - diagonal , diagonal and mixed top and bottom squark pair production @xcite .",
    "however , flavour violation has never been considered in the context of collider searches apart from the ckm - matrix appearing in the electroweak stop - sbottom production channel @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to investigate for the first time the possible effects of non - minimal flavour violation at hadron colliders . to this end",
    ", we re - calculate all squark and gaugino production and decay helicity amplitudes , keeping at the same time the ckm - matrix and the quark masses to account for non - diagonal charged - current gaugino and higgsino yukawa interactions , and generalizing the two - dimensional helicity mixing matrices , often assumed to be real , to generally complex six - dimensional helicity and generational mixing matrices .",
    "we keep the notation compact by presenting all analytical expressions in terms of generalized couplings . in order to obtain numerical predictions for hadron colliders ,",
    "we have implemented all our results in a flexible computer program . in our phenomenological analysis of nmfv squark and gaugino production ,",
    "we concentrate on the lhc due to its larger centre - of - mass energy and luminosity .",
    "we pay particular attention to the interesting interplay of parton density functions ( pdfs ) , which are dominated by light quarks , strong gluino contributions , which are generally larger than electroweak contributions and need not be flavour - diagonal , and the appearance of third - generation squarks in the final state , which are easily identified experimentally and generally lighter than first- and second - generation squarks .",
    "after reviewing the mssm with nmfv and setting up our notation in sec.[sec:2 ] , we define in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] generalized couplings of quarks , squarks , gauge bosons , and gauginos .",
    "we then use these couplings to present our analytical calculations in concise form .",
    "in particular , we have computed partonic cross sections for nmfv squark - antisquark and squark - squark pair production , squark and gaugino associated and gaugino pair production as well as nmfv two - body decay widths of all squarks and gauginos .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] is devoted to a precise numerical analysis of the experimentally allowed nmfv susy parameter space , an investigation of the corresponding helicity and flavour decomposition of the up- and down - type squarks , and the definition of four collider - friendly benchmark points .",
    "these points are then investigated in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] so as to determine the possible sensitivity of the lhc experiments on the allowed nmfv parameter regions in the above - mentioned production channels .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec .",

    "within the sm , the only source of flavour violation arises through the rotation of the up - type ( down - type ) quark interaction eigenstates @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) to the basis of physical mass eigenstates @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , such that d_l , r  =   v^d_l , r  d_l , r &  and   & u_l , r  =   v^u_l , r  u_l , r. the four bi - unitary matrices @xmath14 diagonalize the quark yukawa matrices and render the charged - current interactions proportional to the unitary ckm - matrix @xcite [ eq : ckm ] v  =  v^u_lv^d_l= (    ccc v_ud & v_us & v_ub + v_cd & v_cs & v_cb + v_td & v_ts & v_tb    ) .    in the super - ckm basis @xcite",

    "<S> we present an extensive analysis of squark and gaugino hadroproduction and decays in non - minimal flavour violating supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we employ the so - called super - ckm basis to define the possible misalignment of quark and squark rotations , and we use generalized ( possibly complex ) charges to define the mutual couplings of ( s)quarks and gauge bosons / gauginos . the cross sections for all squark-(anti-)squark / gaugino pair and squark - gaugino associated production processes as well as their decay widths are then given in compact analytic form . for four different constrained supersymmetry breaking models with non - minimal flavour violation in the second / third generation squark sector only , we establish the parameter space regions allowed / favoured by low - energy , electroweak precision , and cosmological constraints and display the chirality and flavour decomposition of all up- and down - type squark mass eigenstates . finally , we compute numerically the dependence of a representative sample of production cross sections at the lhc on the off - diagonal mass matrix elements in the experimentally allowed / favoured ranges . </S>"
