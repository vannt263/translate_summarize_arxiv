    "linear transport through heterogeneous and disordered media emerges in several applications in nuclear science and engineering .",
    "examples are widespread and concern for instance neutron diffusion in pebble - bed reactors  @xcite or randomly mixed immiscible materials  @xcite , and inertial confinement fusion  @xcite . besides , the spectrum of applications is fairly broad and far reaching  @xcite , and concerns also light propagation through engineered optical materials  @xcite or turbid media  @xcite , tracer diffusion in biological tissues  @xcite , and radiation trapping in hot atomic vapours  @xcite , only to name a few .",
    "the key goal of particle transport theory in stochastic media consists in deriving a formalism for the description of the ensemble - averaged angular particle flux @xmath4 , where @xmath5 solves the linear boltzmann equation @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 denoting the position and direction variables , respectively , @xmath9 being the total cross section , @xmath10 the differential scattering cross section , and @xmath11 the source term . for isotropic scattering ,",
    "the differential scattering cross section simplifies to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the surface of the unit sphere in dimension @xmath0 . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we have here focused our attention to the case of mono - energetic transport in non - fissile media , in stationary ( i.e. , time - independent ) conditions .",
    "however , these hypotheses are not restrictive ( see the discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "the stochastic nature of particle transport stems from the materials composing the traversed medium being randomly distributed according to some statistical law .",
    "hence , the quantities @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath14 are in principle random variables",
    ".    a physical realization of the system under analysis will be denoted by a state @xmath15 , associated to some stationary probability @xmath16 of observing the state @xmath15 . to each state",
    "@xmath15 thus correspond the functions @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the material properties  @xcite .",
    "the ensemble - averaged angular flux is then formally defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the solution of the boltzmann equation   corresponding to a single realization @xmath15 .",
    "the ensemble - averaged angular flux can be decomposed as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the probability of finding the material of index @xmath24 at position @xmath7 ( we denote by @xmath25 the marker function of material @xmath24 at position @xmath7 ) , and @xmath26 is restricted to those realizations that have material @xmath24 at position @xmath7 : @xmath27    a widely adopted model of random media is the so - called binary stochastic mixing , where only two immiscible materials ( say @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) are present  @xcite . then , by averaging eq .   over realizations having material @xmath28 at @xmath7",
    ", we obtain the following equation for @xmath30 @xmath31 p_\\alpha \\langle \\varphi_\\alpha \\rangle = \\frac{p_\\alpha \\sigma_{s,\\alpha } } { \\omega_d } \\int \\langle \\varphi_\\alpha({\\bf r } , { \\boldsymbol \\omega } ' ) \\rangle d{\\boldsymbol \\omega } ' + p_\\alpha s_\\alpha + u_{\\alpha,\\beta } , \\label{boltzmann_ave}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 with @xmath33 denoting the probability per unit length of crossing the interface from material @xmath24 to material @xmath34 for a particle located at @xmath7 and travelling in direction @xmath8 , and @xmath35 denoting the angular flux averaged over those realizations where there is a transition from material @xmath24 to material @xmath34 for a particle located at @xmath7 and travelling in direction @xmath8 .",
    "the cross sections @xmath36 and @xmath37 are those of material @xmath28 .",
    "the equation for @xmath38 is immediately obtained from eq .   by permuting the indexes @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the set of equations in eq .",
    "( whose derivation contains no approximations so far ) can be shown to form an infinite hierarchy , since the terms @xmath39 in eq .",
    "would involve equations for the conditional averages @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which in turn would further involve additional conditional averages  @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "it is necessary to truncate the infinite set of equations with some appropriate model leading to a closure formula , depending on the underlying mixing statistics .",
    "the celebrated levermore - pomraning model assumes for instance @xmath42 for homogeneous markov mixing statistics  @xcite , which is defined by @xmath43 depending on the starting position alone , where @xmath44 is the mean chord length for trajectories crossing material @xmath24 in direction @xmath8 .",
    "several generalisations of this model have been later proposed , including higher - order closure schemes  @xcite . in parallel ,",
    "monte carlo algorithms such as the chord length sampling have been conceived in order to formally solve the levermore - pomraning model , and have been further extended so as to include partial memory effects due to correlations for particles crossing back and forth the same materials  @xcite .",
    "their common feature is that they allow a simpler , albeit approximate , treatment of transport in stochastic mixtures , which might be convenient in practical applications where a trade - off between computational time and precision can be worth considering .",
    "originally formulated for markov statistics , these models have been largely applied also to random inclusions of disks or spheres into background matrices , with application to pebble - bed and very high temperature gas - cooled reactors  @xcite .    in order to assess the accuracy of the various approximate models it is therefore mandatory to compute reference solutions for the exact eqs .  .",
    "such solutions can be obtained in the following way : first , a realization of the medium is sampled from the underlying mixing statistics ; then , the linear transport equations corresponding to this realization are solved by either deterministic or monte carlo methods , and the physical observables of interest are determined ; this procedure is repeated several times so as to create a sufficiently large collection of realizations , and ensemble averages are finally taken for the physical observables .",
    "for this purpose , a number of benchmark problems for markov mixing have been proposed in the literature so far  @xcite , with focus exclusively on @xmath1 geometries , either of the rod or slab type .",
    "the aim of this work is two - fold .",
    "first , we will revisit the classical benchmark problem proposed by adams , larsen and pomraning for transport in stochastic media  @xcite .",
    "we will present reference solutions obtained by monte carlo particle transport simulation through @xmath1 slab , @xmath2 extruded and @xmath3 tessellations of a finite - size box with markov mixing .",
    "we will compute the particle flux @xmath45 , the transmission coefficient @xmath46 and the reflection coefficient @xmath47 by taking ensemble averages over the realizations ; the dispersion of the physical observables around their average values will be assessed by evaluating their full distributions .",
    "second , we will discuss the impact of dimension on the obtained results , since benchmark solutions for transport in @xmath2 extruded and @xmath3 tessellations have never been addressed before  @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ benchmark_definition ] we recall the benchmark specifications and set up the required notation . in sec .",
    "[ color_poisson ] we discuss the algorithms needed in order to generate the material configurations corresponding to homogeneous markov mixing , by resorting to the so - called colored poisson tessellations . then , in sec .",
    "[ simulation_results ] we will present our simulation results for the physical observables of interest , and discuss the obtained findings .",
    "conclusions will be finally drawn in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "the benchmark specifications for our work are essentially taken from those originally proposed in  @xcite and  @xcite , and later extended in  @xcite .",
    "we consider single - speed linear particle transport through a stochastic binary medium with homogeneous markov mixing .",
    "the medium is non - multiplying , with isotropic scattering .",
    "the geometry consists of a cubic box of side @xmath48 , with reflective boundary conditions on all sides of the box except two opposite faces ( say those perpendicular to the @xmath49 axis ) , where leakage boundary conditions are imposed : particles that leave the domain through these faces can not re - enter .",
    "lengths are expressed in arbitrary units . in  @xcite and  @xcite ,",
    "system sizes @xmath50 and @xmath51 were also considered , but in this work we will focus on the case @xmath48 , which leads to more physically relevant configurations .",
    "two kinds of non - stochastic sources will be considered : either an imposed normalized incident angular flux on the leakage surface at @xmath52 ( with zero interior sources ) , or a distributed homogeneous and isotropic normalized interior source ( with zero incident angular flux on the leakage surfaces ) . following the notation in  @xcite",
    ", the benchmark configurations pertaining to the former kind of source will be called _ suite _",
    "i , whereas those pertaining to the latter will be called _",
    "the material properties for the markov mixing are entirely defined by assigning the average chord length for each material @xmath53 , namely @xmath54 , which in turn allows deriving the homogeneous probability @xmath55 of finding material @xmath24 at an arbitrary location within the box , namely @xmath56 note that the material probability @xmath55 defines the volume fraction for material @xmath24 .",
    "the cross sections for each material will be denoted as customary @xmath57 for the total cross section and @xmath58 for the scattering cross section .",
    "the average number of particles surviving a collision in material @xmath24 will be denoted by @xmath59 .",
    "the physical parameters for the benchmark configurations are recalled in tabs .",
    "[ tab_param1 ] and  [ tab_param2 ] : three cases ( numbered @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) are considered , each containing three sub - cases ( noted @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) .",
    "the case numbers correspond to permutation of materials , whereas the sub - cases represents varying ratios of @xmath66 for each material ."
