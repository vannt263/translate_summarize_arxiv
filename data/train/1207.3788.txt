    "the casimir - polder force acting between a microparticle and a macrobody is caused by the existence of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field .",
    "this phenomenon is a manifestation of the more general dispersion forces at relatively large separations where the retardation of the electromagnetic interaction becomes significant ( at separations below a few nanometers the electromagnetic interaction can be considered as instantaneous and the dispersion force is usually referred to as the van der waals force ) .",
    "quantum theories of the van der waals and casimir - polder forces were developed by london @xcite and ( for the case of an atom interacting with an ideal metal plate ) by casimir and polder @xcite , respectively .",
    "for an atom interacting with a plate made of some real material described by the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity , the unified theory of the van der waals and casimir - polder forces was developed by lifshitz @xcite ( see also monographs @xcite ) .    nowadays ,",
    "the casimir - polder interaction between different atoms and material plates ( cavity walls ) has attracted much attention in experiments on quantum reflection @xcite .",
    "this is a process in which an ultracold atom is reflected by an _ attractive _ atom - wall potential or , in other words , it is an above - barrier reflection .",
    "it was shown @xcite that quantum reflection is very sensitive to the specific form of the casimir - polder interaction .",
    "theoretically , calculations of the casimir - polder forces between various atoms and plates made of different materials were performed @xcite on the basis of the lifshitz theory .",
    "the results obtained were compared @xcite with those calculated using a simple phenomenological potential @xcite .",
    "recently , special attention has been directed to the casimir - polder interaction with carbon nanostructures , such as graphene , carbon nanotubes , and fullerenes @xcite .",
    "computations were performed using the phenomenological density - functional approach @xcite , second - order perturbation theory @xcite and , for multiwalled carbon nanotubes with at least several walls , using the lifshitz theory @xcite . for",
    "one - atom - thick carbon nanostructures , the concept of dielectric permittivity is not immediately applicable ( it becomes applicable , for example , to thin fullerene films and can be used to deduce the dynamic polarizabilities of single fullerene molecules @xcite ) . in order to extend the lifshitz theory to this case ,",
    "the reflection coefficients of electromagnetic oscillations on graphene were found using the _ hydrodynamic model _ @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , graphene was treated as an infinitesimally thin positively charged flat sheet , carring a homogeneous fluid with some mass and negative charge densities .",
    "the obtained reflection coefficients depend on temperature only through the matsubara frequencies .",
    "calculations of the casimir - polder interaction in the framework of the hydrodynamic model are presented in refs .",

    "the hydrodynamic model of graphene is only a crude approximation .",
    "it does not take into consideration that low - energy excitations in graphene are massless dirac fermions except for the fact that they move with a fermi velocity , rather than with the speed of light @xcite . from this",
    ", it follows that at low energies the dispersion relation for quasiparticles is linear with respect to the momentum measured relative to the corner of the graphene brillouin zone .",
    "the _ dirac model _ of graphene assumes that the dispersion relation is linear at any energy . using this assumption ,",
    "the corresponding reflection coefficients for the electromagnetic oscillations at zero temperature have been found @xcite different from those obtained with the hydrodynamic model .",
    "the obtained coefficients depend on the polarization operator in an external electromagnetic field calculated in the one - loop approximation in three - dimensional spacetime .",
    "note that the exact value of the gap parameter @xmath2 of quasiparticle excitations entering the polarization operator is not known . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that dirac model leads to much smaller values of the van der waals ( casimir - polder ) atom - graphene interaction than the hydrodynamic model at separations below 100 nm . keeping in mind the precision achieved in experiments on quantum reflection of ultracold atoms @xcite , it was concluded that it is possible to experimentally distinguish between the predictions of the dirac and hydrodynamic models of graphene .",
    "the thermal effect in the casimir and casimir - polder interactions is a subject of debate @xcite . for the thermal interaction between two graphene sheets",
    "it was argued @xcite that the thermal regime starts at rather low temperatures @xmath3 ( or , respectively , short separation distances of tens of nanometers at room temperature ) because the value of the effective temperature is determined by the fermi velocity @xmath4 rather than the speed of light @xmath5 .",
    "this conclusion was , strictly speaking , obtained in a nonretarded regime . a fully consistent quantum - field version of the dirac model at nonzero temperature was presented in ref .",

    "the temperature - dependent polarization operator and respective coefficients for electromagnetic oscillations on graphene at nonzero temperature were derived .",
    "computations were performed for a graphene layer with the gap parameter equal to zero interacting with a metallic plate . for this system",
    "the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite on the existence of large thermal corrections at short separation distances was qualitatively confirmed ( with a proviso that the characteristic distance separating zero- and high - temperature regimes depends on the fine - structure constant rather than on the fermi velocity ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite quantum reflection of ultracold atoms from thin films , semiconductor heterostructures and graphene was considered at @xmath6 with graphene being described by both the hydrodynamic and dirac models .",
    "it was concluded that suspended graphene membranes produce higher quantum - reflection probabilities than bulk matter .",
    "the remark made earlier @xcite that already achieved experimental precision allows discrimination between the predictions of different models of graphene was supported .",
    "this conclusion was obtained using the polarization operator at zero temperature @xcite . keeping in mind that suspended graphene membranes with rather large diameter ( of @xmath7 m )",

    "graphene is described using either the hydrodynamic model or the dirac model and the obtained results are compared . in the framework of the dirac model ,",
    "the polarization operator at nonzero temperature is employed and the dependences on the value of the gap parameter @xmath2 are investigated .",
    "we demonstrate that under the condition @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the boltzmann constant , the thermal correction is relatively small , but if @xmath10 there are large thermal corrections to the casimir - polder force . at the same time",
    ", the magnitude of the thermal correction strongly depends on the atom - graphene separation .",
    "the value of the fermi velocity is shown to be of no crucial influence on the magnitude of thermal correction for atom - graphene system .",
    "the novelty of this paper is that the interaction of different atoms with graphene was investigated using the full dirac model at nonzero temperature with the temperature - dependent polarization operator . in so doing it was found that the relative size of thermal correction strongly depends on the gap parameter .",
    "our computations show that experiments on quantum reflection are capable to discriminate between the predictions of the hydrodynamic and dirac models of graphene .",

    "( note that in ref .",
    "@xcite , where computations were performed at @xmath105 nm using the polarization operator at @xmath56 , the predictions of the dirac model were overestimated by approximately a factor of 1.5 due to an error in the computer program . as a result",
    ", the differences between the predictions of two models at short separations were underestimated . )    from the comparison of solid and dotted lines in fig .",
    "5(a ) , we have already found errors arising from the use of polarization operator at @xmath56 in all terms of the lifshitz formula ( an underestimation of @xmath106 by approximately a factor of 1.3 ) .",
    "this conclusion was obtained , however , from the zero - temperature polarization operator with @xmath62 ( as was demonstrated above , computational results with the @xmath3-dependent polarization operator are not sensitive to the value of @xmath2 at @xmath11k ) . to investigate the role of the gap parameter in computations using the polarization operator at @xmath56 , in fig .",
    "5(b ) we plot @xmath87 as a function of separation computed with the full operator ( [ eq4 ] ) , ( [ eq6 ] ) ( the solid line ) and with the operator ( [ eq7 ] ) for @xmath62 , 0.001 , and 0.01ev ( the dotted lines from the highest to the lowest , respectively ) .",
    "note that the solid and the highest dotted lines reproduce the respective lines in fig .",
    "5(a ) at separations from 50 nm to @xmath107 m .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "5(b ) , for nonzero @xmath2 the underestimation of @xmath106 when using the polarization operator at @xmath56 is much larger than for @xmath62 .",
    "thus , at @xmath84 m this underestimation is by the factors of 1.83 and 6.2 for the gap parameter @xmath108 and 0.01ev , respectively .",
    "this adds importance to the use of full temperature - dependent polarization operator ( [ eq4 ] ) , ( [ eq6 ] ) in computations performed for subsequent comparison with the experimental data .",
    "the casimir - polder free energy for other atoms used in experiments on quantum reflection can be computed in a similar way . for na the dynamic polarizability can be presented by eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) with @xmath109 and @xmath110rad / s @xcite .",
    "the computational results for the quantity @xmath87 for na - graphene interaction at @xmath11k are presented in fig .",
    "6(a ) as function of separation by the dashed line ( the hydrodynamic model ) , the solid line [ the dirac model with the @xmath3-dependent polarization operator ( [ eq4 ] ) , ( [ eq6 ] ) ] , and by the dotted line [ the dirac model with the polarization operator ( [ eq7 ] ) at @xmath56 , @xmath62 ] .",
    "it can be seen that qualitatively the computational results in fig .",
    "6(a ) are similar to those in fig .",
    "5(a ) for a he@xmath0 atom . in the case of na , however , the values of @xmath87 are smaller than for he@xmath0 at all respective separations .",
    "the difference between the predictions of the hydrodynamic and dirac models can be easily discriminated by the measurement data of experiments on quantum reflection .",
    "thus , at separations 0.2 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , and @xmath1 m the predictions of the hydrodynamic model are larger than the predictions of the dirac model with the @xmath3-dependent polarization operator by factors of 4.04 , 3.05 , 2.10 , 1.63 , and 1.37 , respectively .",
    "the use of the polarization operator at @xmath56 again underestimates the predictions of the dirac model ( by the factors of 1.27 , 1.29 , and 1.29 at separations @xmath112 , 3 , and @xmath101 m , respectively ) .    in figs .",
    "6(b ) and 6(c ) similar results are presented for atoms rb and cs interacting with graphene .",
    "to perform computations of the casimir - polder free energy using different models of graphene , we have used the single - oscillator model ( [ eq12 ] ) with the following parameters : @xmath113 , @xmath114rad / s @xcite and @xmath115 and @xmath116rad / s @xcite . as can be seen from the comparison of fig .",
    "6(b ) with fig .  6(a ) and fig .",
    "6(c ) with fig .",
    "6(b ) , the magnitudes of the free energy for rb are larger than for na and the respective magnitudes for cs are larger than for rb at all separation distances .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the static polarizability of cs is the largest one . from figs .",
    "6(b ) and 6(c ) one can observe the same pattern between the dashed , solid and dotted lines , obtained for the hydrodynamic model and for the dirac model with @xmath3-dependent and @xmath3-independent polarization operators , respectively , as was discussed on the basis of figs .",
    "5(a ) and 6(a ) .    in figs .",
    "5(a ) and 6(a - c ) , the distinction between the predictions of the hydrodynamic model ( the dashed lines ) and the dirac model with @xmath3-dependent polarization operator ( the solid lines ) deserves special attention .",
    "the point is that the dashed lines demonstrate the same qualitative behavior @xcite as the casimir - polder free energy of atoms interacting with walls made of ordinary real materials , such as au or si . by contrast , the dirac model for graphene predicts quite a different behavior of the free energy , where it is nearly inverse proportional to the third power of separation . keeping in mind that at separations below @xmath1 m the predictions of both models may differ by a factor of 2 and even up to a factor of 4 , it seems appropriate to raise a question which model is in better agreement with the experimental data .",
    "this question can be answered through experiments on quantum reflection of different atoms on suspended graphene membranes .",
    "in this work we have investigated the casimir - polder interaction of different atoms with graphene in the thermal regime .",
    "special attention was paid to the dirac model of graphene and to the conditions when thermal effects become essential .",
    "we have confirmed the conclusion @xcite that sufficient precision can be achieved by using the temperature - dependent polarization operator in the zero - frequency term of the lifshitz formula alone and calculating all the other terms using the polarization operator at @xmath56 .",
    "we have found that a major impact on the thermal correction ( i.e. whether it is small or large ) is made by the size of the gap @xmath2 in the spectrum of graphene nanoparticles . according to our results , if the condition @xmath8 is satisfied with a large safety margin , the thermal correction to the casimir - polder interaction of an atom with graphene is relatively small . in future",
    "it is planed to obtain the asymptotic behavior of the free energy under this condition analytically and to verify the fulfilment of the nernst heat theorem in the dirac model .",
    "if , however , @xmath10 , the thermal correction is relatively large .",
    "furthermore , we have calculated the free energy of the casimir - polder interaction of different atoms used in experiments on quantum reflection ( such as he@xmath0 , na , rb , and cs ) with a suspended graphene membrane .",
    "all computations were performed for room temperature within a wide separation region in the framework of two models for graphene proposed in the literature : the hydrodynamic and dirac ones .",
    "it is important to note that both these models are approximations and _ a priori _ it is not possible to decide which of them provides a better theoretical description of the casimir - polder force ( for example , the drude model of metals describes correctly the electric properties of metals and their dielectric response to external electromagnetic fields , but is in disagreement with the experimental data on measurements of the casimir force between metallic test bodies @xcite ) .",
    "our computational results allow to conclude that the hydrodynamic and dirac models of graphene lead to both qualitatively and quantitatively different results for the free energy of atom - graphene casimir - polder interaction . on the qualitative side",
    ", we have arrived at quite different dependences of the free energy on separation distance .",
    "quantitatively , the magnitudes of the free energies computed using the two models differ by a factor of 2 and even by a factor of 4 at different separations below @xmath1 m .",
    "a difference in theoretical predictions being as large as by this amount assures a reliable discrimination between the hydrodynamic and dirac models of graphene by comparing with the experimental data on quantum reflection . keeping in mind that suspended graphene membranes",
    "have been already produced @xcite , one could expect the resolution of this problem in the immediate future .",
