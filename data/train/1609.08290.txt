    "in the past twenty years , great progress has been achieved on the understandings of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . in particular , swift has opened a new window to understand the nature of grb phenomenon ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the onboard x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) opened an exciting era for grb researches .",
    "it has established a large sample of x - ray light curves from tens of seconds to days , sometimes even months ( e.g. , grb 060729 ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to find that x - ray flares are common in grbs , which occur well after the initial prompt emission @xcite .",
    "x - ray flares have been observed both in long and short grbs @xcite .",
    "based on the observations from swift / xrt , four power - law light - curve segments together with a flaring component are identified in the x - ray afterglow phase @xcite .",
    "the temporal analysis and spectral property suggest that the x - ray flare is from a distinct emission mechanism , since the temporal behavior of flares is quite similar to the prompt emission pulses , whereas different from the other four components in the canonical light - curves .",
    "thus , x - ray flares may have a common physical origin as the prompt pulses @xcite , and are probably related to the late time activity of the central engine @xcite .",
    "the central engine of grbs remains an open question @xcite .",
    "a hyper - accreting stellar - mass black hole ( bh ) or a millisecond magnetar @xcite is usually invoked as possible grb central engine . in the bh",
    "hyper - accretion scenario , the photons generated in the accretion flow can hardly escape due to the extremely large optical depth . on the contrary",
    ", a large amount of neutrinos can escape from the flow and therefore the neutrino cooling may be the most important mechanism to balance the viscous heating .",
    "such a flow is named as the neutrino - dominated accretion flow ( ndaf ) .",
    "the structure and radiation of an ndaf has been extensively studied ( e.g. , @xcite . in the hyper - accretion scenario , the relativistic jet may be powered by the following two mechanisms .",
    "the first one is related to the annihilation of neutrino - antineutrino pairs .",
    "such an annihilation process was previously investigated by several works ( e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the second one is related to the blandford - znajek ( bz ) process @xcite , which can effectively extract the rotational energy of the central bh through large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "the physical origin of x - ray flares remains mysterious , including internal dissipation and external shock mechanisms .",
    "@xcite showed that many x - ray flares are from late - time activity of the internal engine that spawned the initial grb , not from an afterglow - related effect .",
    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite made analyses of the flare temporal and spectral properties of a large sample of early - time flares and of a subsample of bright flares , which revealed close similarities between them and the prompt emission pulses , and therefore pointing to an internal origin .",
    "@xcite investigated the relation between flares and continuum emission , and suggested the variability to be established as a consequence of different kinds of instabilities . on the other hand , from the theoretical view",
    ", @xcite proposed a criterion to separate the internal and external origin of flares .",
    "@xcite concluded that the late - time flares ( @xmath1 ) are not different from the early - time ones , where the majority of the flares can be explained by either internal or external shock .",
    "however , due to the small number of flares ( a sample of 7 grbs ) , the conclusion may require further investigation .",
    "moreover , @xcite focused on the late - time flares ( @xmath2  s ) of a larger sample than @xcite and found that a large fraction of late - time flares are also compatible with afterglow variability .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed internal dissipation and external shock mechanisms of x - ray flares , and concluded that at least a sizable fraction of the flares can not be related to the external shock mechanism , since external shock flares evolve on much longer timescales than observed .",
    "then , some late - time flares in our sample may be related to late - time central engine activity rather than a slower outflow produced simultaneously with the prompt emission . moreover ,",
    "the steep decay of x - ray flares is more likely to originate from the internal dissipation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the present work",
    ", we will adopt two criteria to examine the internal or external origin of the flares in our sample , and then study the possible mechanisms for those flares probably related to internal origin .",
    "several mechanisms and models were proposed to explain the episodic phenomenon of x - ray flares @xcite . according to the internal origin of x - ray flares , the central engine that powers the prompt gamma - ray emission also powers the x - ray flares .",
    "thus , the long - duration flares require the long - lasting activity of the central engine .",
    "for the neutrino annihilation mechanism , as pointed out by @xcite , although such a mechanism may work well for the central engine of the gamma - ray emission , it may encounter difficulty in interpreting the x - ray flares . by considering a possible magnetic coupling between the inner disk and the central bh",
    ", @xcite showed that the annihilation mechanism can also work for the x - ray flares with duration @xmath3 .",
    "however , the annihilation mechanism is unlikely to be responsible for those long flares with duration @xmath4 , even the role of magnetic coupling is included . on the other hand , according to the analyses of @xcite , the bz mechanism may work well even for the long duration flares .",
    "however , outflows were not taken into consideration in @xcite , which can be of importance particularly for relatively low accretion rates where the neutrino cooling is inefficient .",
    "there is a positive correlation for the x - ray flares between the duration @xmath5 and the peak time @xmath6 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the present work ,",
    "we will focus on the extremely late - time x - ray flares with @xmath7  s and study the corresponding central engines .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "our sample and data analyses are presented in ",
    "the different mechanisms for the central engine are investigated in   3 .",
    "conclusions and discussion are made in   4 .",
    "we present an extensive temporal analysis for the x - ray afterglow observed by swift / xrt , and consider all x - ray afterglow light curves of grbs detected by swift / xrt during 11 observation years ( from 2005 to 2015 ) in this repository . the xrt flux lightcurve data and redshift were downloaded from the website http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt curves/[http://www.swift.ac.uk / xrt curves/ ] @xcite .",
    "we examined visually all the light curves and searched for bright x - ray flares with extremely late - time , i.e. @xmath8 and @xmath0 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the peak flux of the flare and the flux of the underlying continuum at @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "we obtain a sample of seven flares from seven grbs , among which three grbs have redshift measurements .",
    "the spectral analyses for the steep decay segments are based on http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt spectra / addspec.php/[http://www.swift.ac.uk / xrt spectra / addspec.php/ ] , which is performed by a power - law spectral model .",
    "the spectral analyses results , i.e. , the values of the spectral index in the decay phase @xmath11 , are shown in table  1 .      in order to estimate the duration and luminosity of flares , a smooth broken power - law function @xcite : @xmath12^{-\\frac{1}{\\omega}},\\ ] ] and a power - law function : @xmath13",
    "are used to fit the light curves of flares and the underlying continuum , respectively . here , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the rise ( decay ) index of x - ray flare , @xmath16 is the break time , @xmath17 is the decay index of the underlying afterglow component , and @xmath18 is used to depict the sharpness around peak flux in the flare light - curve . we would point out that , for the late - time x - ray flares in our sample , it is possible that some of them are a superposition of many shorter flares . in such case , the duration of x - ray flares may be overestimated by a factor of a few . our main concern in this work is the duration of the flare emission episode .",
    "thus , whether a long - duration flare or many shorter flares may not have essential influence on our analysis .    each x - ray flare from our sample is fitted by a smooth broken power - law function as shown by equation  ( [ bpl ] ) .",
    "the peak time @xmath19 can be calculated as @xmath20 the main fitting results are listed in table  1 . as an example , figure  [ f:050502b ] illustrates the fitting procedure of grb 050502b . here",
    ", we define the duration @xmath5 as the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the x - ray flares , and @xmath21 is the duration in the rest frame . by setting the zero time @xmath22 at the grb trigger time , the flares formed in the external shock process has a maximum decay slope @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath11 are the temporal decay index and spectral index in the decay phase , respectively . any decay with a slope steeper than @xmath25 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath26 , may indicate the internal origin of flares @xcite .",
    "then , we compare the values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 for our seven late - time x - ray flares in figure  [ f : alpha and beta ] .",
    "it is seen that four flares in our sample locate well above the red solid line , which means that the four flares satisfy the criterion  @xmath26 \" , and therefore are likely to be internal origin . in the remainder , we will focus on these four flares",
    ".      the isotropic energy @xmath27 of a single x - ray flare in xrt energy range is calculated by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the distance of grb with respect to the observer , and @xmath30 ^{-\\frac{1}{\\omega } } \\ dt \\ , \\ ] ] is the energy fluence in the energy range of swift / xrt ( i.e. , 0.3 - 10  kev ) . here",
    ", @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) can be derived by the two cross points of the two curves corresponding to equations  ( [ bpl ] ) and ( [ pl ] ) ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we choose a sufficiently large time interval , i.e. , from 0.1@xmath34 to 10@xmath35 , for the integration of equation  ( [ bpl ] ) .",
    "the isotropic luminosity @xmath36 of a single x - ray flare is expressed as @xmath37 in addition , the anisotropic effects of the jet radiation should be taken into account .",
    "we adopt @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath39  radian , where @xmath40 is the half - opening angle of the jet related to the flares .",
    "this value is around one order of magnitude larger than the prompt gamma - ray emission ( @xmath41  radian ) @xcite .",
    "the reason of adopting such a value is that there may exist a relation @xmath42 @xcite , and the lorentz factor @xmath43 of the jet producing the x - ray flares may be significantly smaller than that of the gamma - ray emission . thus , the collimated - corrected energy @xmath44 and luminosity @xmath45 .",
    "the main results are shown in table  2 , where the uncertainties of luminosity and energy are given at 1  @xmath46 .",
    "more details about the uncertainties may refer to @xcite .",
    "we would point out that the k - correction is not considered in the present work .",
    "the luminosity and energy will be higher if the k - correction is taken into account . here",
    ", we adopt @xmath47 for those flares without redshift measurements @xcite . in order to explore the range of variability of the luminosity and energy for all possible values of the unknown redshift",
    ", we use @xmath48 and 10 as the lower and upper limits , respectively .    with the above results",
    ", we can examine the relationship between the relative variability flux @xmath49 and the relative variability timescale @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the increase of flux at the peak time @xmath6 , and @xmath10 is the flux of the underlying continuum at @xmath6 ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) . in figure",
    "[ f : flux and width ] , we plot exactly the same five theoretical solid lines as those in figure  6 of @xcite .",
    "the data for our seven late - time x - ray flares are also plotted by different colors in this figure .",
    "another criterion to judge the internal origin or not is to examine the position of a flare in such a figure .",
    "a flare locating in the upper left region ( above the green line and left to the vertical pink line ) can be regarded as the internal origin . on the contrary , the flare locating in other regions may be related to the external origin .",
    "it is seen that two flares ( 050916 and 130925a ) well locate in the upper left region , which corresponds to the internal origin . on the other hand",
    ", the other five flares do not locate in this region , which indicates that the five flares may be related to the external origin . by combining the results of figures 2 and 3",
    ", we can draw the conclusion that , the late - time flares of 050916 and 130925a are probably related to the late - time activity of central engine since both of the two criteria are satisfied , whereas the flares of 070318 , 070429a , and 150626b are more likely to be the external origin since neither of the two criteria is matched . for the rest two flares 050502b and 050724 , however , the physical origin may remain controversial since the criterion ",
    "@xmath26 \" is matched but the other one is not . in particular , for the only short burst 050724 , we noticed that some previous works suggested late - time activity of central engine @xcite , while some other works such as @xcite argued against internal origin .    in the rest part of this paper , we will focus on the four x - ray flares which can satisfy at least one criterion , i.e. , 050502b , 050724 , 050916 , and 130925a .",
    "the main purpose is to investigate the possible central engine , where the internal origin is our basic assumption for such flares .",
    "in this section , we focus on the central engine of the sample of the four late - time x - ray flares based on the energy argument . as mentioned in section  1 , there are two well - known mechanisms related to accreting bhs , i.e. , the neutrino - antineutrino annihilation and the bz process .",
    "we study these two mechanisms in the first and second subsections , respectively .",
    "in addition , we discuss the possibility of an ns system as the engine in the third subsection .      in this subsection , we calculate the neutrino annihilation luminosity based on previous theoretical formulae .",
    "we assume a typical bh mass @xmath52 and a spin parameter @xmath53 .",
    "we adopt the analytic result , equation  ( 22 ) of @xcite to calculate the annihilation luminosity : @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the radius of the marginally stable orbit .    following the spirit of @xcite",
    ", we assume an efficiency @xmath58 as the ratio of the radiated luminosity to the jet power , where the latter may be regarded as around @xmath59 , @xmath60 here , we adopt @xmath61 for analyses . the analytic solution about @xmath57 @xcite",
    "gives @xmath62 for @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "the two critical accretion rates , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , were given by equation  ( 5 ) of @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath66 as @xcite and therefore @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    for the neutrino annihilation mechanism ,",
    "a comparison between the theoretical results and the observations is shown in figure  [ f : neutrino luminosity ] .",
    "for the observations , following the argument in section  2.2 , we adopt @xmath69 with regard to the anisotropic effects .",
    "the red solid lines represent our analytic results for the supplied mass @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "since @xmath72 is the mass supply after the prompt emission , one @xmath71 may be regarded as an upper limit for @xmath72 . for a fixed @xmath72 ,",
    "if outflows are not considered , once the duration @xmath73 is given , the mean mass accretion rate can be estimated as @xmath74 .",
    "then , by equation  ( [ nunu ] ) , we can derive the theoretical annihilation luminosity .",
    "the gray stars in figure  [ f : neutrino luminosity ] represent the observational results for x - ray flares with @xmath75  s , which are taken from @xcite .",
    "the blue and green circles represent the two late - time flares with redshift measurement , whereas the magenta and orange circles represent the other two flares without redshift measurement , where @xmath76 is adopted . the lower limit ( @xmath77 ) and the upper limit ( @xmath78 )",
    "are also shown by the arrows in the same colors .",
    "as shown in figure  [ f : neutrino luminosity ] , the annihilation mechanism can account for only a small fraction of x - ray flares with @xmath75  s. as proposed in @xcite , if the magnetic coupling effects between the inner disk and the central bh are included , the annihilation mechanism may work for @xmath75  s , but still encounter difficulty in interpreting the flares with @xmath79  s. it is seen from figure  [ f : neutrino luminosity ] that , even for @xmath80 the theoretical red line is far from the color circles , which reveals that the annihilation luminosity is too low to power such late - time x - ray flares . in addition , other analytic formulae were proposed for the annihilation luminosity , such as equation  ( 11 ) of @xcite and equation  ( 1 ) of @xcite .",
    "these two analytic formulae can confirm the above conclusion that the annihilation mechanism can not work as the central engine for the extremely late - time flares with @xmath7  s.      an alternative mechanism related to bhs for the central engine for grbs and corresponding x - ray flares is the well - known bz process @xcite , where the rotational energy of bhs can be extracted by the strong magnetic fields and therefore power a relativistic jet .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , based on a common assumption that the magnetic field @xmath81 is around 10% of its equipartition value , the analytic bz jet power can be expressed as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the mass accretion rate near the bh horizon .",
    "similar to the neutrino annihilation case , we use @xmath58 to describe the ratio of the radiated luminosity to the power , @xmath84 where @xmath61 is adopted . for the case of extremely late - time x - ray flares with duration @xmath85s , the mean supplied mass accretion rate ought to be relatively low @xmath86 . in such case , the neutrino cooling will be negligible compared with the viscous heating . in this scenario , outflows ought to be quite strong ( see the discussions in section 4 ) such that @xmath83 will be significantly less than @xmath87 . following previous works on outflows ,",
    "we take the radial profile of the net inflow accretion rate as @xmath88 where @xmath89 according to the analyses and simulations of super - eddington accretion flows @xcite , and @xmath90 may be roughly evaluated as @xmath91 .",
    "we assume @xmath92 according to the hyper - accretion case",
    ". then , equation  ( [ minmout ] ) gives @xmath93 .",
    "in other words , more than 99% of the supplied mass will not enter the bh , but escape from the disk by outflows .",
    "it is obvious from equation  ( [ bz ] ) that such outflows will have essential influence on the power of the bz process .",
    "by combining equations  ( [ bz])-([minmout ] ) we can derive the following relationship : @xmath94    in order to directly compare the theory and the observation , the anisotropic effects of jet radiation should be considered .",
    "the relation between the bz luminosity and the isotropic luminosity takes the form , @xmath95 where @xmath38 is adopted as discussed in section  2.2 .",
    "a comparison of the theoretical results with the observations is shown in figure  [ f : bz luminosity ] .",
    "the two pairs of solid lines correspond to our theoretical results for @xmath96 ( green ) and 0.95 ( red ) , which are calculated by equation  ( [ lx ] ) .",
    "for the two lines in the same color , the upper line corresponds to @xmath97 , and the lower line corresponds to @xmath98 .",
    "similar to figure  4 , the blue and green circles represent the observed x - ray flares with redshift measurements .",
    "the magenta and orange circles represent the other two flares without redshift measurement , where @xmath47 is adopted .",
    "the lower limit ( @xmath48 ) and the upper limit ( @xmath99 ) are also shown by the arrows in the same colors .",
    "it is seen from figure  [ f : bz luminosity ] that , even for the extreme case with @xmath100 and @xmath101 , the bz mechanism can hardly account for these four flares .",
    "the physical reason is that , due to the strong outflows , the mass rate near the bh horizon is quite low ( generally @xmath102 ) , and therefore the magnetic fields accumulated by the accretion will probably be too weak to power such flares .",
    "thus , for the extreme late - time x - ray flares , the bz mechanism may not work as the central engine either .    as shown by equation  ( [ bz ] )",
    ", we adopt @xmath103 for the analyses , which agrees with the simulation results on geometrically thin disks @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite showed that , for geometrically thick disks , however , the relation will be @xmath104 or even @xmath105 for fast rotating cases ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "in other words , the jet luminosity @xmath107 will decrease sharply with decreasing @xmath108 ( e.g. , figure  6 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for the flow with relatively low accretion rates @xmath109 , the neutrino cooling will be inefficient and therefore the disk is likely to be geometrically thick @xcite . as a consequence , our analytic @xmath107 for @xmath110 may be overestimated and therefore @xmath107 in the real cases may be even lower such that it may not be responsible for the late - time flares .",
    "the above two subsections have shown that the central engine for the extremely late - time x - ray flares is unlikely to be associated with bhs . in this subsection",
    ", we study the possibility of an ns system as the engine .",
    "such a model invokes a rapidly spinning , strongly magnetized ns or a magnetar @xcite . in the ns scenario ,",
    "the energy reservoir is the total rotational energy of the magnetized ns , ( see equation  ( 1 ) in @xcite ) : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the ns mass and @xmath113 is the initial spin period .",
    "we therefore take @xmath114erg as a typical rotational energy .",
    "another energy source is the magnetic energy of a magnetar .",
    "the total magnetic energy in a magnetar can be roughly calculated by @xmath115 where @xmath81 is the poloidal magnetic field strength on the horizon . with @xmath116 ,",
    "the total magnetic energy is @xmath117 for @xmath118 .",
    "a comparison of the rotational energy and the magnetic energy with the observations of the x - ray flares is shown in figure  [ f : ns energy ] .",
    "again , we choose @xmath119 due to the anisotropic effects , and the radiative efficiency @xmath120 . for a grb with multiple flares , we plot the total energy of all the flares instead of the single late - time flare .",
    "it is seen that , the energy of flares is significantly larger than the magnetic energy even for @xmath121 g , which implies that the magnetic energy may not power the x - ray flares . or , the magnetic energy can only work with extremely strong magnetic fields @xmath122 g .",
    "such an issue has been investigated by @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the rotational energy ( red dashed line ) is obviously higher than all the observational data , which indicates that the rotational energy may be responsible for the late - time x - ray flares in our sample .",
    "the present work focuses on the central engine of extremely late - time x - ray flares ( @xmath0 ) with the internal origin assumption .",
    "we have investigated the possibility of the two well - known mechanisms related to bhs for the central engine , i.e. , the neutrino - antineutrino annihilation and the bz process .",
    "our results show that the annihilation luminosity is far below the observational data , which indicates that the annihilation mechanism can not account for the extremely late - time x - ray flares . on the other hand , for the bz process ,",
    "if the role of outflows is taken into consideration , the inflow mass rate near the horizon will be quite low such that the magnetic field will probably be too weak to power the observed x - ray flares .",
    "we therefore argue that , for such late - time x - ray flares , the central engine is unlikely to be associated with bhs . on the contrary , a fast rotating ns with strong bipolar magnetic fields",
    "may be responsible for such flares .",
    "we would stress that this work only considered bright flares .",
    "some dim flares at late - time may be missed since the underlying continuum is too bright for their detection .",
    "these dim flares may occupy the lower part of figures  [ f : bz luminosity ] and [ f : ns energy ] , which are possibly consistent with the bz mechanism and the magnetic origin in the magnetar context @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "the existence of outflows is a key point to draw the conclusion that the bz mechanism is unlikely to power the extremely late - time x - ray flares . in recent years",
    ", outflows have been found to be significant in accretion systems of different scales by theories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "based on the balance of heating and cooling , @xcite shows that the outflow is inevitable for the accretion flows that the radiative cooling is far below the viscous heating , no matter the flow is optically thin or thick . in the current work for accretion rates",
    "@xmath123 , neither the photon radiative cooling nor the neutrino one is efficient to balance the viscous heating .",
    "thus , the outflows ought to be significant .",
    "actually , @xcite studied this issue and proposed that there exists a lower critical @xmath124 varying with radius , below which outflows have to occur . from the observational view , taking our galactic center as an example , @xcite reveals that more than 99% of the accreted mass escape from the accretion flow by outflows .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume less than 1% of the supplied mass can enter the bh in the present work .",
    "the present work focuses on the late - time x - ray flares with @xmath0 . on the other hand , a previous work @xcite focused on the x - ray flares with rest duration @xmath125 , and found that the neutrino annihilation mechanism can not account for the flares except for including the magnetic coupling between the inner disk and the bh .",
    "however , such a coupling and corresponding distribution of magnetic fields have not been found in simulations yet .",
    "thus , we would argue that , in general , the annihilation mechanism may not work as the central engine for x - ray flares . for the bz mechanism ,",

    "<S> this work focuses on a sample of seven extremely late - time x - ray flares with peak time @xmath0 , among which two flares can be confirmed as the late - time activity of central engine . </S>",
    "<S> the main purpose is to investigate the mechanism of such late - time flares based on the internal origin assumption . in the hyper - accreting black hole ( bh ) </S>",
    "<S> scenario , we study the possibility of two well - known mechanisms as the central engine to power such x - ray flares , i.e. , the neutrino - antineutrino annihilation and the blandford - znajek ( bz ) process . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the annihilation luminosity is far below the observational data . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the annihilation mechanism can not account for such late - time flares . </S>",
    "<S> for the bz process , if the role of outflows is taken into consideration , the inflow mass rate near the horizon will be quite low such that the magnetic field will probably be too weak to power the observed x - ray flares . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore argue that , for the late - time flares with internal origin , the central engine is unlikely to be associated with bhs . on the contrary , a fast rotating neutron star with strong bipolar magnetic fields </S>",
    "<S> may be responsible for such flares . </S>"
