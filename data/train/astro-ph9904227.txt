    "the history of the study of m  82 is a long and rich one .",
    "m  82 is the prototypical starburst galaxy and since it is one of the nearest ( d = 3.63 mpc - @xcite ) and brightest members of that class , it has been studied at almost every wavelength ranging from the @xmath11-rays through to low frequency radio waves ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite;@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is perhaps impossible for any paper , let alone one this brief , to do justice to this rich history .",
    "we refer the reader to excellent exposes on m  82 in , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "m  82 is also the prototype of the `` superwind '' phenomenon ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these flows are powered by the collective kinetic energy and momentum injected by stellar winds and supernovae in starburst galaxies . while recent studies have established the ubiquity of superwinds in local starburst galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , there is still only a rough understanding of either their dynamics or the processes responsible for the observed optical and x - ray emission ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . without such understanding , it is difficult to quantitatively assess the role that superwinds have played in the formation and evolution of galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and in the chemical enrichment , heating , and possible magnetization of the inter - galactic medium ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the optical and x - ray properties of the spatially - correlated region of x - ray and h@xmath1 line emission recently reported by @xcite ( db hereafter ) to be located roughly 11 kpc above the disk of m  82 , far beyond the region where the superwind has been previously investigated .",
    "we are motivated by the important implications of understanding such a region for the superwind theory .",
    "if this region could be shown to be physically related to the superwind that m  82 is driving , then it implies that winds driven even by energetically - modest starbursts like m  82 are able to reach large distances into the halo , making them more likely to be able to escape the gravitational potential of the galaxy and thereby supply mass , metal , and energy to the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "such a finding would have implications for our understanding of the evolution of the igm , the halos of galaxies , and quasar absorption line systems .",
    "our study of this emission region also provides some unique clues about the physics that underlies the observed x - ray and optical emission from superwinds , and strongly suggests that wind - cloud collisions in starburst galaxy halos are an important emission process .",
    "the rosat pspc data were obtained during the period from march through october 1991 and had a total integration time of about 25 ksec .",
    "m  82 was placed approximately in the center of the field for all the observations , and the source size is small enough so that there is no obscuration of the x - ray emission from m  82 due to the mirror ribs .",
    "we extracted a spectrum from a region of diffuse x - ray emission located about 11 arc minutes north of m  82 , and coincident with the region of h@xmath1 emission reported by db .",
    "we will subsequently refer to this region as the `` ridge '' of emission .",
    "this area of x - ray and optical emission is oriented roughly parallel to the major axis of m  82 , and was denoted as sources 8 and 9 in @xcite .",
    "we extracted source counts in an elliptical region with a major ( minor ) axis of 3.3 ( 1.8 ) arc minutes oriented in a position angle of 43@xmath12 .",
    "this region is just sufficient to encompass all of the obvious x - ray emission , but excludes the soft point source at the ene end of the ridge of emission that is discussed in  3.2 below .",
    "we have also extracted source counts for the portion of the ridge that is contaminated by this point source using a circular aperture with a diameter of 1.75 arcmin .",
    "the background for these spectra was taken from a large region where there were no apparent background sources to the south and west of m  82 .",
    "the relative distance of the background region from the center of the pspc field was approximately the same as that for the ridge of emission .",
    "the spectrum was then grouped such that each channel contained at least 25 counts . the extracted background subtracted data were subsequently fitted with various models using the package xspec .",
    "we have also inspected the archival rosat hri data for m  82 .",
    "these data have lower sensitivity than the pspc data , and provide no spectral information .",
    "however , they do provide significantly higher spatial resolution ( @xmath106 arcsec fwhm on - axis and @xmath1015 arcsec at the position of the x - ray ridge ) .",
    "the data we have used comprise a 53 ksec exposure taken in april and may 1995 .",
    "we have used these data only to study the morphology of the x - ray ridge .",
    "our optical images of m  82 were taken on the night of february 27 , 1995 ( ut ) using the kpno 0.9 m telescope .",
    "we observed with a tek 2048@xmath13 ccd and through the optics of 0.9 m , this yielded a scale of 0.68 arc seconds pixel@xmath3 and a total field of view of over 23 arc minutes .",
    "the night was not photometric , with cirrus around all night and intermittent patches of thicker clouds .",
    "m  82 was observed through two filters , a narrow - band filter with a full width at half maximum of 29  and a central wavelength of 6562  and a wider filter with a fwhm of 85  and a central wavelength of 6658 .",
    "the first filter effectively isolated h@xmath1 and underlying continuum and did not include emission from either [ nii ] lines at 6548 and 6584 .",
    "the second filter provided a line - free measure of the continuum and was used for continuum subtraction of the first narrow - band filter to produce a h@xmath1 line - only image of m  82 .",
    "the total integration time in each filter was 1200 seconds .",
    "the images were reduced in the usual way ( bias subtracted , flat - fielded , and then the narrow - band continuum image was aligned and scaled to subtract the continuum from the narrow - band h@xmath1 image ) using the reduction package irafiraf is distributed by the national optical astronomy observatories , which are operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
    ", under cooperative agreement with the national science foundation .",
    "since the data were taken under non - photometric conditions , fluxing the data directly using observations of spectrophotometric standards is impossible .",
    "however , obtaining fluxes and hence luminosities is very important to our analysis .",
    "therefore , to estimate the h@xmath1 flux and continuum flux - density of the off - band filter of the continuum and emission - line nebulae of m  82 , we bootstrapped from the flux given in a 5.8 arc second circular aperture centered on knot c from @xcite .",
    "knot c was chosen because it was easily identifiable in our images and it appears in a relatively uncomplicated region of line emission .",
    "this procedure yields a h@xmath1 flux from m  82 of about 4.6 @xmath0 10@xmath14 ergs cm@xmath4 s@xmath3 , which compares very well with the h@xmath1 flux from m  82 estimated by @xcite of 4.5@xmath010@xmath14 ergs cm@xmath4 s@xmath3 over a similar region 90 `` @xmath0 90 '' .",
    "all subsequent results for the h@xmath1 flux and luminosity of various features within the h@xmath1 image of m  82 will rely on this bootstrapping procedure .    to estimate the continuum flux - density we used the flux - density of oconnell & mangano taken at 6560 . since the center of our narrow - band continuum emission is 6658 , we are thus assuming that the continuum has a constant flux - density between 6560  and 6658 . to see",
    "if this extrapolation procedure is accurate , we compared the flux in r of m  82 in a 35 arc second aperture of 1.97@xmath0 10@xmath2 ergs cm@xmath4 s@xmath3@xmath3 ( from ned based on data originally obtained by @xcite ) .",
    "if we also take the total counts in the 6658filter and determine the flux - density by extrapolating the conversion factor from measuring knot c of oconnell & mangano , we find a flux - density of 2.11 @xmath0 10@xmath2 ergs cm@xmath4 s@xmath3 @xmath3 in a 35 arc second aperture .",
    "our extrapolated flux is within 10% ( 0.1 magnitudes ) and thus this extrapolation is reasonably accurate .",
    "the h@xmath1 and narrow - band continuum images of m  82 are quite spectacular ( figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "we find that the line emission is very extended , with discernible h@xmath1 line emission extending to about 11 kpc above the plane of m  82 .",
    "this very faint emission can be seen even more clearly in the deeper h@xmath1 image obtained by db . like previous authors ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , we find that the h@xmath1 line emission has a very complex morphology that is very suggestive of outflowing gas , with loops , tendrils , and filaments of line emission pointing out of the plane of the galaxy .",
    "an especially interesting feature reported by db is the faint ridge of emission about 11 arc minutes north of m  82 at a position angle of about @xmath1520@xmath12 from the nucleus .",
    "this ridge is then about 11.6 kpc ( in projection ) north of m  82 at the adopted distance of 3.63 mpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the dimensions of the ridge down to surface brightnesses of about 3.5 @xmath0 10@xmath16 ergs s@xmath3 cm @xmath4 arcsec@xmath4 are about 3.5 arc minutes long @xmath0 0.9 arc minutes wide , with the long axis being approximately parallel to the major axis of m  82 . at the assumed distance of m  82",
    ", this size translates into approximately 3.7 kpc @xmath0 0.9 kpc and the total h@xmath1 flux from this ridge of emission is 1.5 @xmath0 10@xmath2 ergs s@xmath3 cm @xmath4 .",
    "this flux is reasonably close to the estimate in db of 1.2 @xmath0 10@xmath2 ergs s@xmath3 cm@xmath4 , and yields an h@xmath1 luminosity of 2.4@xmath0 10@xmath5 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "the total h@xmath1 flux for the whole of m  82 is approximately 4.6 @xmath0 10@xmath14 ergs s@xmath3 cm @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the ridge of emission constitutes approximately 0.3% of the total h@xmath1 emission from m  82 ( not corrected for internal extinction ) .",
    "while the ridge appears rather structureless in our h@xmath1 image , the deeper image published by db shows a collection of bright knots and loops or filaments connected to and immersed in the more diffuse and pervasive emission .    the narrow - band line - free _ continuum _ image reveals a complex morphology that is as interesting as the h@xmath1 image . besides the obvious complex dust absorption that is seen in the image ( with some dark features oriented perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy )",
    ", we also see filaments of continuum emission extended out of the plane of the galaxy ( although the filaments are not entirely obvious in figure 2 ) .",
    "these filaments have twists and turns as seen projected on the sky , but generally point perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "they extend outwards almost 3 arc minutes to the northwest and almost 2.5 arc minutes to the southeast  corresponding to a projected distance out of the plane of about 3 kpc . even though the continuum emission is in many ways as complicated as that seen in the h@xmath1 image",
    ", we do not observe any continuum emission from the ridge of spatially coincident h@xmath1  x - ray emission .",
    "using the counts to flux - density conversion for the narrow - band line - free continuum image and the same aperture as used to measure the h@xmath1 flux ( but with the point sources removed from the area ) , we find an upper limit for the possible continuum emission from the ridge of fainter than 15.8 r magnitudes .",
    "this then implies an absolute r magnitude fainter than @xmath1512.0 .    while we find no evidence for any diffuse , spatially - extended optical continuum associated with the h@xmath1 ridge , we do find a relatively bright point source in the line - free image that is coincident with the x - ray point source seen at the ene end of the ridge in the rosat hri data",
    "this point source has an r magnitude of 12.2 .",
    "we will discuss its likely nature in the next section .",
    "the optical images described above were aligned with the x - ray images starting with the coordinates given for the x - ray data from rosat and using the positions of stars within the frame from the guide star catalogue and using coordinates given in the header from the digital sky survey .",
    "we then slightly adjusted the x - ray pointing by identifying and aligning x - ray sources on the digital sky survey image of the region .",
    "the close spatial correspondence between the ridge of optical and x - ray emission about 11 arcmin to the north of m  82 is obvious ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we do not display the rosat hri image of the ridge , since these data show only that the ridge is largely diffuse and structureless with the 15 arcsec ( 260 pc ) off - axis spatial resolution of the hri .",
    "the only substructure is a point source at the easternmost end of the ridge .",
    "this source appears to coincide with a stellar object visible in figure 2 ( the relatively bright star - like object located about 40 arcsec ene of knot ` i ' in figure 2 of db ) .",
    "this is most likely a foreground star , as we will briefly discuss below .",
    "examination of the 0.25 kev , 0.75 kev , and 1.5 kev pspc maps of m  82 presented by @xcite ",
    "hereafter dwh  shows that the x - ray morphology of the ridge is energy - dependent .",
    "the ene portion of the ridge ( source 9 in dwh ) is relatively much more conspicuous in the 0.25 kev map compared to the rest of the ridge ( source 8 in dwh ) .",
    "this reflects the contamination of the eastern - most ridge emission by the ( presumably ) unrelated point - source visible in the hri image .",
    "as described in  2.1 above , we have therefore extracted a pspc spectrum of the main body of the ridge from a region that excluded the point source .",
    "the relatively small number of detected photons precludes fitting complex multi - component models , and we fit a model of a single thermal ( `` mekal '' ) component to the spectrum .",
    "we are motivated to use a thermal model by the detailed x - ray spectroscopy of the brighter portions of the m  82 outflow ( dwh ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fits strongly preferred a low absorbing column , so we simply froze the column at the galactic value of n@xmath6 = 3.7 @xmath0 10@xmath7 cm@xmath4 .",
    "the data quality were not adequate to fit for the metal abundance , so we froze this at the solar value .",
    "changing the assumed metal abundance did not significantly affect the best - fit temperature , but does directly affect the normalization of the fit .",
    "the best - fit temperature was kt=0.76@xmath90.13 kev ( 90% confidence interval with a reduced @xmath17 @xmath18 1.3 ; figure 3 ) .",
    "the relatively high temperature is similar to that measured in the rosat pspc spectroscopy of the innermost region of the m  82 outflow ( @xmath100.7 kev ; dwh ; @xcite ) .",
    "the total unabsorbed flux in the 0.1  2.4 kev band from this part of the ridge of emission is 8.5 @xmath0 10@xmath19 ergs cm@xmath4 s@xmath3 .    for the ene part of the ridge",
    "- whose emission is contaminated by the point source described above - we have fit a two - component mekal model ( figure 3 ) .",
    "both components were frozen at solar abundances , one component ( the ridge emission ) had an absorbing column frozen at n@xmath6 = 3.7 @xmath0 10@xmath7 cm@xmath4 , and the other ( the stellar point source ) had an absorbing column frozen at 0 .",
    "this fit yields kt=0.85@xmath90.17 kev for the ridge and kt@xmath100.1 kev for the point source .",
    "the corresponding unabsorbed fluxes are 5.8 @xmath0 10@xmath19 ergs cm@xmath4 s@xmath3 and 3.5 @xmath0 10@xmath20 ergs cm@xmath4 s@xmath3 for the ridge and point source respectively . combining the fits for the two regions of the ridge ,",
    "the total x - ray flux is then 1.4 @xmath0 10@xmath2 ergs cm@xmath4 s@xmath3 .",
    "this comprises about 0.7% of the total unabsorbed x - ray emission from m  82 in the pspc band ( e.g. , @xcite ; dwh ) .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity of the ridge of emission is 2.2@xmath010@xmath5 ergs s@xmath3 ( in the 0.1  2.4 kev band ) .",
    "as stated above , the ene point source is identified with a stellar object having an r magnitude of 12.2 ( @xmath21f@xmath22 = 1.6 @xmath0 10@xmath23 erg cm@xmath4 s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the x - ray / optical flux ratio suggests that the most likely nature of this source is a late - type dwarf star , and this would also be consistent with its soft rosat pspc spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "being able to isolate the ridge of emission to the north of m  82 allows us to investigate its nature separately from the rest of m  82 .",
    "could this ridge of emission be due to another galaxy near m  82 , or is it instead gas excited by the m  82 starburst ?",
    "we have found that the ridge of x - ray and h@xmath1 emission has fairly high x - ray and h@xmath1 luminosities  both luminosities are in the range observed for star - forming dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , we see no evidence for any optical continuum emission from this ridge .",
    "the limit for the level of continuum emission implies that any putative galaxy must be very low luminosity , comparable to that of the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the limit on the continuum emission implies an h@xmath1 equivalent width of greater than 180 . examining the sample of galaxies with m@xmath24 fainter than @xmath1515 in the the h@xmath1 survey of nearby dwarf irregular galaxies by @xcite , we find that these have typical global h@xmath1 equivalent widths of a few to a few tens of  . the only such galaxy with an h@xmath1 equivalent width comparable to our lower limit for the m  82 ridge is ddo53 .",
    "this galaxy has a ratio of hi mass to h@xmath1 luminosity ( in solar units ) of 420 .",
    "the corresponding hi mass for the m  82 ridge would have to be 2.5 @xmath25 m@xmath26 .",
    "the hi map in @xcite implies a maximum hi mass in the m  82 ridge that is only about 10@xmath27 m@xmath28 .",
    "moreover , while the m  82 ridge has an x - ray luminosity similar to that of the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc1569 ( @xcite ) , the m  82 ridge would have a ratio of x - ray to optical continuum luminosity that would be over 40 times higher than ngc1569 .",
    "thus , it is clear that the ridge in m  82 has properties that are very different from those of star - forming dwarf galaxies .",
    "this argument , together with the strong morphological connection between the m  82 ridge and the m  82 outflow ( see db ) , leads us to conclude that this ridge is _ not _ a dwarf star - forming galaxy .",
    "other possibilities for this region , like a cloud in the halo of the milky way are also highly unlikely .",
    "the hi detected in the data of @xcite and the h@xmath1 emission from the spectrum of db have velocities such that it they are both likely to be associated with m  82 and not the galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . moreover , while galactic high velocity hi clouds often show soft x - ray excesses ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the associated x - ray emission is very soft ( @xmath180.1 - 0.2 kev ; see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the ridge is evidently related to , and excited by m  82 . in the case of the h@xmath1 emission two possibilities are obvious .",
    "either the superwind in m  82 has worked its way out to @xmath1811 kpc above the plane of the galaxy and is shocking halo material that appears in plentiful supply around m  82 ( @xcite , 1994 ) , or lyman continuum radiation from the starburst is ionizing gas at very large distances from the disk",
    ". only the first possibility could apply to the x - ray emission from the ridge .",
    "let us suppose that ambient gas is being photoionized by the stellar population of m  82 .",
    "the rate of ionizing photons from m  82 is approximately @xmath29 s@xmath3 ( @xcite and references therein ) . using the projected size and distance from m  82 estimated for the ridge of emission given in the previous section , and assuming that the ridge is really a `` box '' with a depth equal to its projected length ( i.e. , 3.7 kpc @xmath0 3.7 kpc ) we find that the ridge will intercept about 8 @xmath0 10@xmath30 ionizing photons s@xmath3 .",
    "this of course is an upper limit since some ( most ? ) of the ionizing photons will be absorbed or dust - scattered before they reach distances as great as 11.6 kpc out of the plane of m  82",
    ". we can estimate the rate of photons necessary to give the h@xmath1 luminosity of the ridge ( 2.4 @xmath0 10@xmath5 ergs s@xmath3 ) by assuming that the gas is in photo - ionization equilibrium , i.e. , the number of recombinations equals the number of absorptions . using the numbers for the case b effective recombination rate of h@xmath1 from @xcite we find that it is necessary to have a rate of @xmath10 2@xmath0 10@xmath31 ionizing photons s@xmath3",
    "this is @xmath1040 times smaller than the upper limit for the number of photons that m  82 is able to provide , so only about 2 to 3% of the ionizing radiation initially emitted in the direction of the ridge needs to make it to this distance .",
    "such an ` escape fraction ' is consistent with hut spectra of starbursts below the lyman edge ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and it seems plausible that the optimal path along which ionizing radiation could escape from a starburst is along the cavity carved - out by the superwind .",
    "db have made similar arguments in favor of a starburst - photoionization origin for the h@xmath1 emission .",
    "however , photoionization by stars does not produce the hot x - ray emission that is coincident with the h@xmath1 emission . instead",
    ", shock - heating by the superwind may be an efficient mechanism for producing coincident x - ray and line - emitting plasma .",
    "we now explore the energetic plausibility of this model , and revisit the issue of the role of photoionization in  4.5 .",
    "the ridge of emission has an x - ray luminosity of 2.2 @xmath0 10@xmath5 ergs s@xmath3 and a temperature of 9@xmath0 10@xmath27 k. assuming that the shock is strong and adiabatic , we have that @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the mass per particle , @xmath34 is the shock velocity , and @xmath35 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "thus to produce gas with t = 9 @xmath0 10@xmath27 k requires a shock speed of 820 km s@xmath3 .",
    "such a high shock speed is quite reasonable considering that m  82 has been estimated to have a deprojected outflow velocity in optical line emitting filaments observed along the minor axis of roughly 660 km s@xmath3 ( @xcite ) , and the outflowing x - ray gas could _ in principle _ have a velocity as high as 3000 km s@xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it would take material traveling at 820 km s@xmath3 , @xmath181.4",
    "@xmath0 10@xmath36 yrs to travel the 11.6 kpc from m  82 to the ridge of emission .",
    "since this is approximately the estimated lifetime of the starburst in m  82 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , it is very plausible that the starburst could drive a shock over its lifetime this far out of the galactic plane .",
    "if we assume that we are observing a `` box '' of emission with dimensions of 3.7 kpc @xmath0 3.7 kpc @xmath0 0.9 kpc , the total volume is 3.7 @xmath0 10@xmath37 @xmath38 . assuming this region is occupied by hot gas filling a fraction f@xmath39 of this volume , the measured luminosity in the rosat band pass of 0.1 to 2.4 kev implies that the x - ray emitting gas has an electron density , n@xmath40 = 5.4 @xmath0 10@xmath41 f@xmath39@xmath42 @xmath38 , pressure , p@xmath43 2n@xmath40kt=1.3 @xmath0 10@xmath14 f@xmath39@xmath42 dynes cm@xmath4 , cooling time , t@xmath44 @xmath45=2.7 @xmath0",

    "this in turn implies that n@xmath52 = 5 @xmath38 and m@xmath51 = 1.1 @xmath0 10@xmath56 m@xmath28 .",
    "we note that a small volume filling - factor for this gas is consistent with the complex knotty , filamentary structure seen in the deep h@xmath1 image in db .",
    "the total bolometric luminosity and ionizing luminosity of m  82 ( @xcite and references therein ) can be used together with the starburst models of @xcite to predict the rate at which the starburst injects mechanical energy and momentum . while these predictions will depend to some degree on the evolutionary state of the starburst ( cf .",
    "figures 66 through 69 in leitherer & heckman ) we estimate that the mechanical luminosity and momentum flux provided by m  82 are @xmath10 2.5 @xmath0 10@xmath57 erg s@xmath3 and @xmath10 2 @xmath0 10@xmath58 dynes respectively . for this wind mechanical luminosity ,",
    "the rate at which the x - ray ridge intercepts this energy is 2.5 @xmath0 10@xmath59 @xmath60@xmath3",
    "erg s@xmath3 , where @xmath60 is the total solid angle into which the wind flows ( @xmath60 @xmath61 4@xmath62 ) . comparing this heating rate to the x - ray luminosity of the ridge ( 2.2 @xmath0 10@xmath5 erg s@xmath3 ) shows that the wind could easily power the emission .",
    "it could also supply the ridge s estimated thermal energy in a timescale of 10@xmath63 f@xmath39@xmath47 @xmath60 years ( much less than the wind / starburst lifetime ) .    matching the observed high pressure in the x - ray ridge",
    "is more challenging .",
    "a wind momentum flux of 2.5 @xmath0 10@xmath58 dynes leads to a wind ram pressure at a radius of 11.6 kpc of 2 @xmath0 10@xmath14 @xmath60@xmath3 dyne cm@xmath4 .",
    "consistency with the x - ray pressure estimated above would require that the x - ray gas has a large volume filling factor ( f@xmath39 @xmath10 unity ) and that the m  82 wind is rather well collimated ( @xmath60 @xmath10 1.5 steradian ) .",
    "this latter constraint is consistent with the morphology of the outflow ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , we can use the empirical measurements of the gas pressure in the inner region of the m  82 nebula ( @xcite ) and extrapolate these outward , assuming that the wind ram pressure falls as r@xmath4 .",
    "the pressure at a radius of 1 kpc was measured to be @xmath10 5 @xmath0 10@xmath23 dyne cm@xmath4 , and so the predicted wind ram pressure at a radius of 11.6 kpc would be @xmath10 4 @xmath0 10@xmath64 dyne cm@xmath4 , about a factor three smaller than the estimated value ( for f@xmath39 = 1 ) . in view of the uncertainties in the estimated physical parameters for the x - ray ridge ,",
    "we regard this level of disagreement as acceptable .    if the optical line emission is also shock - excited by the outflowing wind , then the luminosity observed at h@xmath1 should be consistent with the wind energetics .",
    "we can estimate the amount of emission from a shock as follows .",
    "the total energy dissipated in a shock is , @xmath65 ergs s@xmath3 , where @xmath66 is the shock surface area in kpc@xmath13 , @xmath67 is the preshock density ( @xmath38 ) , and @xmath34 is in units of km s@xmath3 . from @xcite , we have using the equation above , l@xmath68 ergs s@xmath3 , if 90 km s@xmath3 @xmath69 @xmath34 @xmath69 1000 km s@xmath3 . adopting",
    "the geometry above , the total surface area that the ridge would present to the wind would be 3.7 by 3.7 kpc .",
    "the observed h@xmath1 luminosity of the ridge ( 2.4 @xmath0 10@xmath5 erg s@xmath3 ) then requires that @xmath70 = 1.0 @xmath0 10@xmath71 , while the pressure estimated in the x - ray ridge ( 1.3@xmath0 10@xmath14 dynes cm@xmath4 ) requires @xmath72 = 8 @xmath0 10@xmath71 .",
    "thus , provided that the shock speed is greater than 100 km s@xmath4 , it can both produce the observed h@xmath1 emission - line luminosity and be consistent with the pressure estimated for the hot shocked gas observed in the x - rays .",
    "what is the physical relation between the h@xmath1 and x - ray emission in this type of model in which the superwind drives a shock into an ambient cloud in the halo of m  82 ?",
    "one possibility is that the shock driven into the cloud by the wind is fast enough ( i.e. , @xmath10 800 km s@xmath3 ) to produce the x - ray emission , and that the shocked gas then cools radiatively down to temperatures of - order 10@xmath50 k and produces the observed h@xmath1 emission via recombination .",
    "the difficulty with this simple model is that the estimated radiative cooling time in the x - ray gas ( @xmath10 3 @xmath0 10@xmath46 years ) is very long compared to the characteristic dynamical time for the x - ray ridge : t@xmath73 @xmath10 ( 0.9 kpc/820 km s@xmath3 ) @xmath10 1 @xmath0 10@xmath27 years .",
    "simply put , this model would require the x - ray ridge to be @xmath10 300 kpc thick and the h@xmath1 emission would be at the back edge of this very thick cooling zone ! an additional persuasive argument against this model is provided by the rather quiescent kinematics of the h@xmath1-emitting material reported by db .",
    "their optical spectra show that the h@xmath1 emission in the ridge spans a velocity range of only about 10@xmath13 km s@xmath3 , which is inconsistent with material cooling behind a shock with a velocity nearly an order - of- magnitude larger . while the relatively small difference db report between the mean velocity of the ridge and m  82 proper ( blueshift of 50 to 200 km s@xmath3 ) could perhaps be explained as a projection effect in an outflow seen nearly in the plane of the sky",
    ", this effect could not explain the narrowness of the h@xmath1 emission - line in the ridge ( @xmath10 10@xmath13 km s@xmath3 ) without appealing to an unreasonably idealized shock geometry ( which is bellied by the morphological complexity of the h@xmath1 emission in the image published by db ) .",
    "a much more plausible alternative is that we are actually observing _ two _ physically - related shocks in the m  82 ridge .",
    "we propose that as the superwind encounters a large cloud in the halo of m  82 , it drives a relatively slow ( of - order 10@xmath13 km s@xmath3 ) radiative shock into the cloud . at the same time",
    ", this encounter also results in a fast ( 820 km s@xmath3 ) stand - off bow - shock in the superwind fluid upstream from the cloud .",
    "the slow cloud shock ( aided and abetted by ionizing radiation from m  82 ) produces the h@xmath1 emission .",
    "this is consistent with the quiescent h@xmath1 kinematics .",
    "the fast bow - shock in the wind produces the x - ray emission and is predicted to only be offset from front edge of the cloud by a fraction of the size of the cloud ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "pressure balance between the two shocks requires that @xmath74 , where @xmath75@xmath76 and @xmath75@xmath77 are the preshock densities in the wind and cloud respectively . the observed",
    "x - ray pressure and temperature imply that v@xmath78 @xmath10 820 km s@xmath3 and n@xmath79 @xmath10 1 @xmath0 10@xmath41 @xmath38 . thus - for example - if the shock speed in the cloud is v@xmath80 = 100 km s@xmath3 , then n@xmath81 0.07 @xmath38 .",
    "we note further that the velocity of the bow shock is just the difference between the outflow velocity of the superwind itself and that of the shocked cloud . assuming that latter velocity is much smaller than the former ( as is suggested by the kinematic information provided by db ) , the wind velocity implied by the x - ray temperature is @xmath10 820 km s@xmath3 . to drive a wind with a terminal velocity of 820 km s@xmath3",
    ", hot gas would need to be injected into the starburst at a mean mass - weighted temperature of 1 @xmath0 10@xmath36 k ( @xcite ) .",
    "this temperature is consistent with x - ray spectroscopy of the hot gas in the core of m  82 ( dwh , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have seen above that the radiative cooling time in the x - ray ridge is @xmath10300 times longer than the characteristic dynamical time for the ridge .",
    "this implies that the wind bow shock is adiabatic .",
    "this can also be seen by comparing the total rate of energy dissipation in the shock ( @xmath82 erg s@xmath3 for the parameters estimated above ) to the observed x - ray luminosity of the ridge ( 2.2 @xmath0 10@xmath5 erg s@xmath3 ) .",
    "thus , the thickness of the x - ray ridge in the direction of the outflow is set by the dimensions of the region where adiabatic expansion and cooling causes the x - ray surface - brightness to drop precipitously .",
    "this region will be of - order the size of the obstacle in the flow that has caused the bow - shock to develop ( the cloud ) .",
    "this is consistent with the observed x - ray morphology and the good spatial correlation seen between the h@xmath1 and x - ray emission .",
    "we have also estimated previously that the superwind can supply the ridge with its estimated thermal energy content in a timescale of - order 10@xmath27 years .",
    "this is roughly equal to the dynamical time in the ridge ( the timescale for adiabatic cooling ) , as required .",
    "we conclude that it is energetically feasible for the cloud to be shock - heated by a superwind driven by the starburst in m  82 .",
    "a wind / cloud shock interpretation leads to no uncomfortable estimates of the luminosity , covering fraction , or time scales .",
    "in addition , as noted previously , there is ample evidence that m  82 lies in an `` hi halo '' ( @xcite , 1994 ) .",
    "it is likely that the outflowing gas has intercepted and shock - heated some of this halo material , which is observed to be clumpy over large scales ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we also note that perhaps one may have expected to find stronger evidence _ a priori _ for such interactions on the north side of the plane of m  82 compared to the south side : @xcite find that the velocity gradient in the hi is much higher on the northern side ( 12 km s@xmath3 kpc@xmath3 ) of the plane of m  82 compared to that on the southern side ( 36 km s@xmath3 kpc@xmath3 ) .",
    "this higher gradient may be related to our observation of co - spatial h@xmath1 and thermal x - ray emission at large distances from the plane of m  82 .",
    "we have shown that a simple model of the interaction between a fast ( @xmath10 800 km s@xmath3 ) wind and a massive cloud can quantitatively explain the physical and dynamical properties of the ridge . however , it a fair question to ask why the putative cloud is not observed in the sensitive hi map published by @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we have estimated above that the high pressures in the x - ray gas and the low velocity of the shock driven into the cloud by the wind together mean that the preshock density of the cloud must be of - order 10@xmath3 @xmath38 . for a cloud with a line - of - sight dimension of 3.7 kpc ,",
    "the implied cloud column density is then @xmath1010@xmath83 cm@xmath4 .",
    "the hi map in @xcite constrains the hi column density of the ridge to be @xmath69 2.7@xmath0 10@xmath84 cm@xmath4 .",
    "this implies that the cloud must now be fully ionized .",
    "this could be accomplished by either the wind - driven shock or by the ionizing radiation from m  82 .",
    "the time for the shock to traverse the cloud will be @xmath10 10@xmath85 years for @xmath86 = 100 km s@xmath3 , comparable to the estimated age of the starburst and its superwind .",
    "similarly , the velocity of a photo - ionization front moving though the cloud is just @xmath87 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where @xmath88 is the incident flux of ionizing radiation .",
    "the observed h@xmath1 luminosity and the assumed cross - sectional area the cloud presents to the starburst ( 3.7 by 3.7 kpc ) imply that the average value of @xmath88 is 1.5 @xmath89 s@xmath3 cm@xmath4 , where @xmath90 is the fraction of the incident ionizing photons absorbed by the cloud ( i.e. , allowing the cloud to be optically - thin ) . for a preshock density of 0.07 @xmath38 in the cloud ,",
    "the implied velocity is @xmath91 210 f@xmath92@xmath3 km s@xmath3 , and the time for the front to cross the cloud is about 4 @xmath0 10@xmath27 f@xmath92@xmath3 years .",
    "thus it is plausible that an initially neutral cloud like those seen in the hi maps of yun et al .",
    "( 1993,1994 ) has indeed been fully ionized in the time since the starburst and its superwind turned on .",
    "our rough estimates suggest that the timescale for the cloud to be fully photoionized is likely to be somewhat shorter than the timescale for it to be fully shock - ionized .",
    "if correct , this would mean that the h@xmath1 emission produced by the gas cooling and recombining behind the shock would have a high density and pressure , while the rest of the ionized cloud ( the as - yet unshocked material ) would be at a much lower pressure and density .",
    "we speculate that the bright knots and loops of h@xmath1 visible in the image in db may correspond to shock - excited emission from gas with a high pressure , while the fainter and more diffuse emission may come from the low - pressure starburst - photoionized gas that has not yet been shocked .",
    "it is often difficult to associate discrete x - rays sources seen in the halos of starburst galaxies with activity in the starburst galaxy itself .",
    "often , it is assumed that most discrete objects observed in the halos of starbursts are more distant objects ( usually qsos ) seen in projection . finding a spatial association between h@xmath1 emission at the redshift of the starburst galaxy and x - ray emission is a irrefutable way of being able to associate the x - ray emission directly with activity within the starburst galaxy .    having",
    "argued that this co - spatial region of soft x - ray and h@xmath1 emission must be due to the outflowing superwind , it is now evident that at least some starburst galaxies are able to drive material to much larger distances from their nuclei than would be inferred using the relatively high surface brightness x - ray or line emission that is generally observed along their minor axes ( see e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; dwh ) . in m  82",
    "for example , the inner `` continuous '' region of bright h@xmath1 and x - ray emission extends only about 5 arcminutes from the nucleus along the minor axis . the detached `` ridge '' of emission that we have discussed is at a projected angular separation from the nucleus of over twice this distance ( about 11 arcminutes ) .",
    "thus without making the association between the h@xmath1 and x - ray emission , a variety of interpretations for the source of the x - ray emission from this region would be possible .",
    "this obviously has important implications for our understanding of superwinds .",
    "it emphasizes that one must be careful in using the observed spatial scales of the extended emission in starbursts to either access whether or not the wind material is able to escape the potential of the host galaxy or to estimate the dynamical age of the outflow .",
    "it is interesting in this vein to consider the long - term fate of the hot gas in the x - ray ridge of m  82 .",
    "to do so , we will compare the observed temperature of the gas to the `` escape temperature '' at that location in the m  82 halo .",
    "following @xcite , the escape temperature for hot gas in a galaxy potential with an escape velocity v@xmath93 is given by : t@xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 ( v@xmath93/100 km s@xmath3)@xmath96 k. the combined co plus hi rotation curve of m  82 shows a roughly keplerian decrease with radius for radii greater than 0.4 kpc , and @xmath97 has dropped to 60 km s@xmath3 at a radius of 3.5 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "if this keplerian fall - off continues to larger radii , the implied escape velocity at a radius of 11.6 kpc is only 45 km s@xmath3 and the corresponding escape temperature is t@xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath98 k. this is 450 times cooler than the observed x - ray emission . even if we assume instead that m  82 has an isothermal dark matter halo with a depth corresponding to a circular velocity of 60 km s@xmath3 ( the maximum permitted by the directly measured rotation curve ) and further assume that this halo extends to a radius of 100 kpc , the escape velocity at r = 11.6 kpc is about 150 km s@xmath3 and t@xmath93 = 2.5 @xmath99 k. this is still a factor of 36 below the observed temperature of the gas in the ridge .",
    "this implies that the observed hot gas ( and by inference , the superwind itself ) will be able to escape the gravitational potential of m  82 .",
    "the x - ray / h@xmath1 ridge has particularly interesting implications for the physics of superwind emission .",
    "while the existence of superwinds is now well - established , the process(es ) by which they produce x - ray emission is ( are ) not clear .",
    "this topic has been nicely reviewed by @xcite .",
    "if the outflowing wind consists purely of the thermalized ejecta from supernovae and stellar winds , the wind fluid is hot ( @xmath10 10@xmath46 k prior to adiabatic cooling ) and is so tenuous that it will be an insignificant source of x - ray emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "various alternatives have been proposed to boost the x - ray luminosity produced by a superwind : 1 ) substantial quantities of material could be mixed into the wind in or near the starburst as the stellar ejecta interact with the starburst ism ( the wind could be centrally `` mass - loaded '' - @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "2 ) large quantities of gas could be added _ in situ _ as the wind overtakes and then evaporates or shreds gas clouds in the galactic halo ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these clouds could either be pre - existing clouds in the halo or material from the disk of the starburst galaxy that has been carried into the halo by the wind .",
    "3 ) the tenuous wind fluid could drive a shock into a denser volume - filling galactic halo , with the observed x - ray emission arising from the shocked - halo material rather than the wind - fluid itself .    in the case of the ridge of emission in the halo of m  82 ,",
    "we have argued that the observable x - ray emission arises as the wind fluid  which due to adiabatic expansion and cooling would otherwise have an x - ray surface - brightness below the level detectable in the existing rosat image ",
    "encounters a few - kpc - size - scale cloud in the halo .",
    "we have argued that the observed x - ray emission is produced in the bow - shock created in the superwind just upstream of the cloud .",
    "this process might be particularly relevant to the case of m  82 , which is immersed in an extensive system of tidally - liberated gas clouds , shared with its interaction partners m81 and ngc3077 .",
    "such material would also provide a potential source of optical line emission by either intercepting a small portion of the ionizing radiation produced by the central starburst or as it is shock - heated by the superwind . given the strong connection between galaxy interactions / mergers and the starburst phenomenon ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein )",
    ", this mechanism may be generally applicable to superwinds .",
    "we report an analysis of a newly - discovered ( @xcite ) region of spatially - coincident x - ray and h@xmath1 emission to the north of the prototypical starburst / superwind galaxy m  82 . at the distance of m  82",
    "( 3.63 mpc ) the dimensions of this correlated ridge of emission are 3.7 @xmath0 0.9 kpc and it lies at a projected distance of about 11.6 kpc above the plane directly along the minor axis of m  82 ( and hence along the axis of the superwind ) .",
    "we measure a total h@xmath1 flux from the ridge of 1.5 @xmath0 10@xmath2 ergs s@xmath3 cm @xmath4 .",
    "this flux yields a total h@xmath1 luminosity of 2.4 @xmath0 10@xmath5 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "the total h@xmath1 flux for the whole of m  82 is approximately 4.6 @xmath0 10@xmath14 ergs s@xmath3 cm @xmath4 .",
    "thus the h@xmath1 ridge constitutes approximately 0.3% of the total observed h@xmath1 flux from the galaxy .",
    "x - ray emission is seen over the same region as the h@xmath1 emission by the rosat pspc and hri . with the 15 arcsec ( 260 pc )",
    "off - axis spatial resolution of the hri , the ridge is diffuse and featureless except for a ( probably unrelated ) soft point source at its ene end .",
    "the best fit to the x - ray emission from the ridge is a single thermal component with a temperature of kt=0.80@xmath90.17 kev , absorbed by a column density n@xmath6 = 3.7 @xmath0 10@xmath7 cm@xmath4 .",
    "the absorption is consistent with the foreground galactic column .",
    "the total unabsorbed flux from the ridge of emission is 1.4 @xmath0 10@xmath2 ergs cm@xmath4 s@xmath3 and its luminosity of 2.2 @xmath0 10@xmath5 erg s@xmath3 comprises about 0.7% of the total x - ray emission from m  82 in the 0.l  2.4 kev rosat band .",
    "we find that the observed h@xmath1 emission from the ridge could be produced via photoionization by the dilute radiation from the starburst propagating into the m  82 halo along the path cleared by the superwind . on the other hand ,",
    "the x - ray emission from the ridge can be most naturally explained as the result of shock - heating associated with an encounter between the starburst - driven galactic `` superwind '' and a large photoionized cloud in the halo of m  82 .",
    "shock - heating may also contribute significantly to the excitation of the h@xmath1 emission , especially the regions of the highest surface brightness .",
    "we find that the h@xmath1 and x - ray luminosities and the x - ray temperature and estimated gas pressure can all be quantitatively understood in this context .",
    "the specific model we favor is one in which the encounter between the superwind and the cloud drives a slow radiative shock into the cloud ( producing some of the h@xmath1 emission ) and also leads to an adiabatic x - ray - emitting bow - shock in the superwind fluid upstream from the cloud .",
    "the cloud is now fully ionized , and so is not detected in the hi maps of yun et al .",
    "( 1993 , 1994 )",
    ". the wind - cloud interaction process may be especially relevant to m  82 , whose halo contains tidally - liberated gas clouds .",
    "however , it may well occur generally in powerful starbursts ( which are usually triggered by galaxy interactions or mergers ) .",
    "the existence of a region of spatially coincident x - ray and h@xmath1 emission with strong evidence for wind / cloud interaction is important for several reasons .",
    "firstly , our analysis sheds new light on the physical processes by which galactic winds produce x - ray emission , and implies that wind / cloud collisions are an important emission - producing process .",
    "the emission ridge in m  82 highlights the potential pitfalls in using the observed x - ray or h@xmath1 emission to trace the size and infer the ages or fates of galactic winds : the winds may extend to radii far larger than the region over which they have densities and temperatures high enough to produce observable emission .",
    "wind - cloud encounters then offer us the possibility of ` lighting up ' the wind at radii that are otherwise inaccessible .",
    "the x - ray ridge in m  82 implies that the wind is able to reach large heights above the plane of the galaxy , thereby increasing the likelihood that it will be able to eventually escape the galaxy potential well .",
    "indeed , the observed gas temperature exceeds the local `` escape temperature '' from the m  82 gravitational potential well by about two orders - of - magnitude .",
    "this result strengthens the case that starburst - driven galactic winds are important sources of the metal - enrichment and heating of the intergalactic medium .",
