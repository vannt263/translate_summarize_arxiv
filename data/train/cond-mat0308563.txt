    "the promise of molecular materials ( mm ) for advanced applications is impressive : not only _ old _ devices can be fabricated by light - weighted , flexible and cheap materials , but a new generation of devices is likely to appear to drive a molecular electronic and/or photonic revolution .",
    "large non - linear responses to external perturbations ( including electrical and optical fields ) are required for applications and functional mm are often based on @xmath0-conjugated molecules and polymers .",
    "structure - properties relationships are well understood at the molecular level at least for a few families of molecules , @xcite and the guided synthesis of molecules with specified behavior has already been demonstrated . @xcite",
    "but as the synthetic ability evolves from the molecular to the supramolecular level , @xcite interpretative tools are required to guide the synthesis at all stages , and supramolecular structure - properties relationships must be devised .",
    "extending our comprehension of the properties of mm from the molecular to the supramolecular level is a challenging task since non - additive , collective behavior appears in mm as a results of intermolecular interactions .",
    "particularly important collective effects are expected in functional mm based on large ( and largely polarizable ) @xmath0-conjugated molecules , as it was suggested by mcconnell , 40 years ago , @xcite and as it was more recently underlined with specific reference to mm for non - linear optical ( nlo ) applications.@xcite    the mean - field ( mf ) approach is a simple approximation scheme to describe the ground state ( gs ) of mm . within mf",
    "the problem of @xmath1 interacting molecules factorizes into @xmath1 effective molecular problems and collectivity is introduced by the local self - consistent fields generated by the surrounding at each molecular site .",
    "recently the mf approximation was implemented into a quantum chemical calculation of the polarization of crystals and films of large conjugated molecules.@xcite the charge distribution on polarizable molecular sites is strongly affected by local electric fields , and prominent collective behavior is recognized in the very large on - site charge redistribution in crystals of quadrupolar molecules.@xcite so far the approach was not applied to crystals or films of polar molecules , where even larger effects are expected .",
    "the mf approximation does not apply to excited states , that in mm are usually described within the excitonic approach , a very popular approximation scheme originally developed for weakly interacting mm.@xcite in this limit sizeable collective phenomena are expected only if intermolecular interactions mix up degenerate ( or quasi - degenerate ) states . within the excitonic model , then , any interaction among states with a different number of excitations is disregarded .",
    "the mf approximation supports collective behavior , but suppresses any correlation of the electronic motion on different molecules .",
    "the excitonic approximation instead describes _ collective and correlated _",
    "excited states.@xcite but , not accounting for the mixing of states with a different number of excitations , the excitonic model disregards the molecular polarizability , a serious limitation for mm of interest for advanced applications .",
    "moreover , the excitonic model relies on the definition of molecular ( local ) ground and excited states , as states relevant to the molecule embedded in the material , but no hint is given on how to derive these effective states from the molecular and supramolecular structure.@xcite    in clusters of non - polar molecules leading supramolecular interactions are represented by electrostatic interactions between transition dipole moments : the resulting @xmath2-term in the excitonic model describes exciton hopping between different sites.@xcite the same interaction is also responsible for the so - called non - heitler - london term:@xcite this term , neglected in the excitonic approximation , mixes up states whose exciton number differs by two units .",
    "a recent detailed study has demonstrated that this term has indeed only minor effects in aggregates of non - polar chromophores.@xcite    the simple excitonic model derived for materials made up of non - polar molecules is often adopted , with no further scrutiny , to describe materials based on polar molecules . in this case , however , additional interactions appear due to the finite permanent dipole moments of the molecular units in both the ground and excited states .",
    "in particular , the interaction between permanent dipole moments on different molecular units introduces in the hamiltonian an exciton - exciton interaction term .",
    "this term conserves the exciton number and therefore survives in the excitonic approximation .",
    "the role of the exciton - exciton interaction in promoting bound - exciton states ( and specifically biexcitons ) in layers of polar molecules , was investigated in ref . .",
    "the formation of exciton strings was also discussed in ref . as a consequence of exciton - exciton interactions in models for linear aggregates",
    "this same concept was applied in a different context , to explain anomalous spectral features in differential transmission spectra of organic charge - transfer ( ct ) salts with a mixed donor - acceptor ( d - a ) stack motif , @xcite leading to the experimental confirmation of bound exciton states .",
    "the excitonic model was developed to describe mm in the limit of weak interactions , i.e. for intermolecular energies much smaller than intramolecular excitation energies.@xcite electrostatic interactions among polar molecules are instead large , and can easily be of similar magnitude or even larger than the small excitation energies typical of largely polarizable molecules .",
    "the failure of the excitonic model to describe interacting polar and polarizable molecules is therefore hardly surprising .",
    "however , since current understanding of optical properties of mm generally relies on the excitonic picture , it is important to explicitly discuss the limits of this approximation .",
    "we will show that the properties of mm based on polar and polarizable molecules are quantitatively as well as qualitatively different from the sum of the molecular properties .",
    "new and interesting physics appears in these materials due to supramolecular interactions , and it can not be appreciated within standard approximation schemes .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the gs and the excitation spectrum of a simple model for clusters of polar and polarizable chromophores .",
    "each molecular unit is described in terms of the mulliken model.@xcite this two state model was originally proposed to describe d - a ct complexes in solution.@xcite later it was adopted to model nlo responses of push - pull chromophores,@xcite an interesting class of @xmath0-conjugated molecules with electron d and a end groups . in this context",
    "the mulliken model , extended to account for the interaction with internal vibrations and/or with solvation degrees of freedom , offered an accurate description of low - energy spectral properties of solvated push - pull chromophores.@xcite intermolecular interactions are introduced in terms of classical electrostatic forces , any intermolecular charge resonance being disregarded ( zero intermolecular overlap approximation).@xcite the resulting model quite naturally applies to mm based on push - pull chromophores . by choosing different geometries for the cluster , the model describes different kinds of materials , like , e.g. , aggregates , langmuir - blodgett ( lb ) films , functionalized polymers , and molecular crystals .    in a different context ,",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) models for aligned polar and polarizable units , only interacting via electrostatic forces offered a first description of the neutral - ionic ( n - i ) phase transition observed in ct crystals with a mixed stack motif.@xcite this model is fairly crude , since it reduces a stack of overlapping molecules ( ... d - a - d - a .... ) to a collection of non - overlapping dimers ( ... d - a d - a .... ) . in spite of that , a mf description of the relevant gs offered a first picture for the n - i transition , and specifically for the crossover from a continuous n - i interface to a discontinuous transition at large electrostatic interactions.@xcite more recently the same model , within the excitonic approximation , yielded an interesting picture for the excitation spectrum of mixed stack ct salts with a largely n gs.@xcite",
    "the mulliken model @xcite was originally proposed to describe charge resonance in isolated d - a complexes on the basis of the two limiting neutral ( n ) and ionic ( i ) states : @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the same model describes intramolecular charge resonance in push - pull chromophores where the same two basis states describe the limiting apolar and charge - separated ( zwitterionic ) structure,@xcite as schematically shown in fig . 1 for a typical chromophore .",
    "following mulliken , we disregard all matrix elements of the dipole moment operator , except the dipole moment of the charge separated , ionic ( i ) state , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 measures the distance between d and a molecules in ct complexes or an effective molecular length in push - pull chromophores .",
    "if @xmath7 is the energy gap between the two basis states , and @xmath8 is the mixing matrix element ( in the following we will fix @xmath9 as the energy unit ) , the mulliken hamiltonian is written as :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the ionicity operator , measuring the degree of ct from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the solution of this hamiltonian is trivial .",
    "the resulting ground and excited state are linear combinations of the two basis states , and the amount of mixing is defined in terms of a single parameter :    @xmath15    as follows :    @xmath16    @xmath17 is the gs expectation value of the charge operator and is proportional to the gs molecular dipole moment : @xmath18 .",

    "both @xmath57 and @xmath58 work on two sites : @xmath57 conserves the total number of excitations and hence enters the excitonic hamiltonian , whereas @xmath58 mixes up states differing by one or two excitation , it represents an ultraexcitonic term that will be disregarded in the excitonic approximation .    the transformation in eq .",

    "it is important to realize , however , that the second term in @xmath56 does not conserve the exciton number and must be killed in the excitonic approximation .",

    "the primary photoexcitation event is in these conditions a multielectron transfer that is a direct consequence of the correlation of the electronic motion among different non - overlapping molecules .",
