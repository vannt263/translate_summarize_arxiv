    "dynamical fragmentation ( i.e. the growth of substructure during near - freefall collapse ) is widely believed to play an important role in star formation , both as a means of forming star clusters , and as a means of forming binary systems ( e.g. bate , bonnell & price 1995 ; bodenheimer , 1978 ; bodenheimer & boss , 1981 ; bonnell & bastian 1993 ; bonnell & bate 1994 ; boss , 1991 , 1993 ; boss & bodenheimer 1979 ; burkert & bodenheimer 1996 ; chapman et al .",

    "1995 ) .",
    "recently larson ( 1995 ) has analyzed the grouping of pre  main - sequence ( pre - ms ) stars in taurus , and identified a critical length - scale @xmath2 0.04 pc .",
    "on larger scales the pre - ms stars appear to be clustered in a self - similar hierarchy , with the mean surface - density of neighbours @xmath3 decreasing with angular separation @xmath4 as @xmath5 . on smaller scales",
    "the pre - ms stars have on average just one companion , which is usually tightly bound in a binary system ; here the mean surface density of companions decreases as @xmath6 .",
    "larson suggests that these binary ( and occasionally higher multiple ) systems are formed by dynamical fragmentation .",
    "he proposes that @xmath7 is simply the jeans length appropriate for the conditions prevailing in taurus , and that the corresponding jeans mass is @xmath1 .",
    "he then points out that if there is a preponderance of marginally jeans - unstable clumps with @xmath8 collapsing and fragmenting into binary and triple systems , this will yield protostellar masses in the range 0.3 to 0.5 @xmath9 , i.e. very close to the characteristic mass of the initial mass function , @xmath10 .",
    "however , there is a large range of densities in taurus , and presumably an even large range of conditions in the various star - formation regions which form the entire ensemble of stars defining the initial mass function .",
    "therefore there must be a wide range of jeans lengths .",
    "here we argue that the onset of fragmentation at the scale @xmath7 is in fact due to the density becoming just high enough for the gas to couple thermally with the dust , and thereby greatly increase its cooling efficiency , by availing itself of the dust s continuum opacity .",
    "this circumstance defines a length - scale @xmath11 and a mass - scale @xmath12 which are only weakly dependent on metallicity and environmental factors .",
    "we concur with larson s inference that dynamical fragmentation will then tend to deliver protostars with masses around the peak in the imf at @xmath13 .",
    "dynamical fragmentation can only occur if the gas cools efficiently by radiating .",
    "specifically , the gas must be able to radiate away  on a dynamical timescale or faster  the internal energy generated by gravitational compression ( hoyle 1953 , rees 1976 , low & lynden - bell 1976 , silk 1977 ) . at high densities",
    "this requires continuum opacity , and for cold ( @xmath14k , say ) gas having finite metallicity this opacity is supplied by dust .",
    "recently , larson s analysis of the grouping of pre - ms stars in taurus has been confirmed by simon ( 1997 ) .",
    "simon has also repeated this analysis for the @xmath15 ophiuchus and orion - trapezium star - formation regions .",
    "he finds that the surface - densities of neighbours and companions obey similar power laws , @xmath16 on large scales , and @xmath17 on small scales .",
    "however , he finds that the switch occurs at different projected separations : @xmath18 0.06 pc in taurus , @xmath18 0.025 pc in @xmath15 ophiuchus , and @xmath18 0.002 pc in orion - trapezium .",
    "simon argues that this variation is difficult to attribute to systematic changes in the jeans length between the different star - formation regions .",
    "we propose that some of this variation arises because the different star - formation regions have very different large - scale surface densities .",
    "proceeding from taurus , through @xmath15 ophiuchus , to orion - trapezium , the large - scale surface - density of stars increases significantly . and",
    "so the switch must shift to smaller projected separations , even if the intrinsic distribution of binary separations is identical .",
    "kitsionas , gladwin and whitworth ( 1998 ) have also re - analyzed taurus , with a larger sample of pre - ms stars .",
    "they have repeated this analysis for the chamaeleon i star - formation region .",
    "power - law fits to @xmath19 give exponents similar to those obtained by larson ( 1995 ) and simon ( 1997 ) .",
    "for chamaeleon i the switch is at @xmath18 0.03 pc , as would be expected on the basis of its high overall surface - density .    in section 2 and",

    "we evaluate thermal coupling between gas and dust . in section 4 and appendix b",

    "appendix c demonstrates that for fragments having radius @xmath22 0.1 pc , gas - cooling by dust dominates over gas - cooling by lines . in section 5",
    "we derive an expression for the mean ( frequency - averaged ) optical depth due to dust . in section 6",
    "we combine the results from the previous sections to define the domains on the ( @xmath23 ) and ( @xmath24 ) planes where gas - cooling by dust facilitates dynamical fragmentation . in section 7",
    "we discuss the results , and in section 8 we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "for an approximately spherical fragment which has just become jeans unstable , the mass @xmath25 , radius @xmath26 , temperature @xmath27 and mean gas - particle mass @xmath28 are related by    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is a numerical factor of order unity ( see below ) , @xmath31 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath32^{1/2}$ ] is the isothermal sound speed .",
    "if the gas remains isothermal , then by the time this fragment has contracted sufficiently for sub - fragments of mass @xmath33 to become jeans unstable , the original fragment has radius @xmath34 , and is collapsing at speed @xmath35 . consequently the compressional heating rate is    @xmath36}{dt}\\ ] ]    @xmath37    in appendix a we develop a simple time - dependent model of jeans instability which enables us to estimate @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "for the purpose of numerical estimates , we set @xmath40 ( up to 5 fragments ) .    for completeness",
    ", we also include a cosmic - ray heating rate    @xmath41    with @xmath42 erg s@xmath43 g@xmath43 .",

    "( [ hcr ] ) makes no allowance for the attenuation of cosmic rays in the interior of a dense fragment .",
    "however , this can only reduce the cosmic - ray heating rate , and it turns out that even the unattenuated rate is not very important in the regime with which we are concerned , i.e. the regime where gas - cooling by dust facilitates dynamical fragmentation .",
    "if the gas in a fragment is thermally coupled to the dust , the continuum opacity of the dust affords the fragment an efficient means of radiating away the internal energy generated by gravitational compression .",
    "here we formulate the rate @xmath45 at which the gas transfers thermal energy to the dust .",
    "if a fraction @xmath46 by mass of the interstellar medium is in the form of spherical dust grains having radius @xmath47 and internal density @xmath48 , the rate of transfer of thermal energy to the dust is given by    @xmath49    @xmath50 \\right\\ } \\",

    "with which we are mainly concerned here , @xmath56 , since the rotational degrees of freedom of h@xmath57 are not excited .",
    "the maximum radiative cooling rate is obtained by assuming that the fragment radiates like a blackbody , i.e.    @xmath58    this is a maximum cooling rate on four counts .",
    "first , it assumes that the collapsing fragment exists in isolation . in reality ,",
    "part of the luminosity from the fragment will be cancelled by the flux of background radiation incident on the surface of the fragment .",
    "the background radiation field will consist of a cosmic component at @xmath59 3 k , plus a contribution from local sources such as stars , protostars , circumstellar cocoons and discs , warm molecular clouds .",
    "a detailed evaluation of this contribution would be extremely model - dependent .",
    "for the purpose of this paper , we represent the background with a single blackbody component at temperature @xmath60 3 k.    second , it assumes that the cloud has continuum opacity at all wavelengths  or , at the very least , across a broad range of wavelengths near the peak of the blackbody spectrum .",
    "third , it assumes that , at these wavelengths around the peak , scattering is negligible compared with absorption and emission .",
    "fourth , it assumes that , at these wavelengths around the peak , the cloud is neither optically thin , nor very optically thick .",
    "if we define a mean optical depth @xmath61 between the centre and the surface of the fragment ( i.e. an optical depth averaged over the frequencies which contribute to radiative cooling of the fragment at temperature @xmath27 ) , the radiative cooling rate is given approximately by    @xmath62    @xmath63    here , @xmath64 is a critical optical depth , typically @xmath18 20 , and the second term in braces simply ensures that the cloud must be hotter than the background to cool radiatively .",
    "( [ lrad ] ) is constructed so as to give the correct asymptotic forms .",
    "for example , if @xmath65 , then in the optically thin limit ,    @xmath66    at modest optical depths ,    @xmath67    and at high optical depths ,    @xmath68    this last form is derived in appendix b , and takes account of the fact that high luminosities can only be transported through the interior of an optically thick fragment if there is a sufficiently large temperature difference between the centre of the fragment and its surface . to take account of this",
    ", we require that no more than a fraction @xmath69 of the fragment s mass be hotter than @xmath70 , where @xmath27 is now specifically the surface temperature .",

    "the domain in which gas - cooling by dust facilitates quasi - freefall collapse and dynamical fragmentation ( hereafter the _ dust - domain _ ) is given by    @xmath90    the dust - domain can be defined on both the ( @xmath23 ) and the ( @xmath24 ) planes , using eqn .",
    "( [ jeans ] ) and @xmath91 to convert from one to the other .    in order to simplify the analysis",
    ", we put @xmath92 10 k in @xmath93 ( eqn .",
    "( [ cdust ] ) ) , and @xmath94 in @xmath95 ( eqn .",
    "( [ lrad ] ) ) . to justify this we note that the section of the dust - domain boundary where @xmath93 is important is quite distinct from the section where @xmath95 is important , _ viz .",
    "_    consider first the large-@xmath96 limit of the dust - domain , where @xmath97 , so @xmath98 dominates the righthand side of inequality ( [ domain ] ) , i.e. the critical process is the transfer of thermal energy from the gas to the dust . under this circumstance",
    "the thermal balance of the dust involves a much more rapid energy turnover than that of the gas ( e.g. whitworth & clarke 1997 ) . hence the heat input from thermal coupling to the gas",
    "makes a negligible contribution to the thermal balance of the dust .",
    "the dust temperature @xmath99 is determined by the background radiation field , and adopts a value of order the background temperature @xmath100 .",
    "next consider the small-@xmath96 limit of the dust - domain , where @xmath101 , so @xmath102 dominates the righthand side of inequality ( [ domain ] ) , i.e. the critical process is the emission of radiation by the dust and its escape from the fragment . at these high densities the gas and dust",
    "are closely coupled .",
    "a very small temperature difference suffices to transfer the compressional heating of the gas to the dust , and we can approximate @xmath103 .    in between these two limits , the dust - domain boundary is determined at high temperatures by dust evaporation , and at low temperatures by the fact that the gas can not cool below the background temperature .",
    "consequently there is no need to formulate accurately the circumstances under which @xmath104 .",
    "figure 1 shows contours of constant    @xmath105    on the ( @xmath23 ) plane , for @xmath106 , @xmath107 10k , and @xmath108 .",
    "the region inside the outer contour is the dust - domain .",
    "contours are drawn for @xmath109 1.00 , 0.32 , 0.10 & 0.03 , to emphasize how efficient gas - cooling by dust becomes inside the dust - domain .",
    "starting at the righthand side , and working round in a clockwise sense , the dust - domain limits are caused by ( a ) gas - dust coupling in the high - temperature ( elastic ) limit ; ( b ) gas - dust coupling in the low - temperature ( perfectly inelastic ) limit ; ( c ) the background temperature acting as a minimum temperature ( @xmath110 ) ; ( d ) the dust being optically thin ; ( e ) the dust optical depth being intermediate ( @xmath111 ) ; ( f ) the dust being optically thick ; ( g ) dust evaporation .",
    "_ partial _ dust evaporation actually promotes fragmentation in the high density limit by reducing the dust optical depth , but it inhibits gas - dust coupling ; this is why the dust - domain boundaries curve towards higher densities as they approach the evaporation limit .",
    "the same contours are presented on the ( @xmath24 ) plane in figure 2 .",
    "the dashed line indicates the background temperature @xmath100 .",
    "the most relevant part of the dust - domain is probably the part corresponding to low temperatures , @xmath11250k , but we have plotted the whole domain in order to avoid the extremely model - dependent complexities of predicting the gas temperature precisely .",
    "of course , to be important in this context gas - cooling by dust must not only be able to handle the net heating of a fragment , it must also be able to handle it more effectively than , or at least as effectively as , gas - cooling by lines .",
    "figure 1 shows that the dust - domain has @xmath220.1pc , and appendix c demonstrates that for protostellar fragments with @xmath220.1pc , gas - cooling by dust is more effective than gas - cooling by lines .",
    "on figure 1 , we have also plotted the mean observed distribution of clump masses and radii , as collated by chize ( 1987 ) .",
    "this distribution approximates to    @xmath113 ^ 2 \\ ; .\\ ] ]    and is marked by a line of open circles on figure 1 .",
    "if the clumps were thermally virialized , we could use eqn .",
    "( [ jeans ] ) to convert this distribution into    @xmath114^{-1 } \\ ; ; \\ ] ]    and this is marked by the line of open circles on figures 2 .",
    "however , all but the very low - mass clumps are supported by non - thermal motions , with the gas being at rather low temperatures , typically in the range 10 to 15 k , and seldom above 50k .",
    "thus , although the locus of clumps in figure 1 appears to run rather close to the boundary of the dust - domain , it is only the low - mass clumps  those supported mainly by thermal pressure  that are really close to the dust - domain .",
    "even these may be unable to access the dust - domain without some external perturbation .",
    "the gas in a high - mass clump can probably only enter the dust - domain if it is compressed and heated by a shock , for example following a collision with another clump of comparable mass , or as a consequence of being overrun by an expanding nebula ( hii region , stellar - wind bubble or supernova remnant ) .",
    "gas - cooling by lines will play an important role in such shocks ( as a means of removing the dissipated energy ) , but appendix c shows that the shock - compressed gas will then only be able to condense further and fragment if it is dense enough to couple thermally to the dust .    a number of observations might be explained on the basis of the dust - domain and its relation to the locus of observed clumps .",
    "low - mass ( @xmath1 ) clumps are supported mainly by thermal pressure ( myers 1983 ) .",
    "therefore , in the absence of external perturbations , they should relax to hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "however , figures 1 & 2 suggest that such clumps need a relatively small external perturbation  and possibly no perturbation at all  to enter the dust - domain . consequently we might expect a large fraction of stars to be formed from the collapse of such clumps . if dynamical fragmentation leads typically to the formation of a binary or triple system , with most of the clump mass ending up in the component stars , then the initial mass function ( imf ) should peak in the range 0.2 to 0.5 @xmath9 , as it apparently does ( scalo 1986 ) .",
    "this last point was emphasized by larson ( 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , if an external perturbation is involved , this should greatly increase the chances of permanent fragmentation during the ensuing collapse .",
    "this is because the clump would be delivered into the dust - domain with highly non - linear substructure , and gravity would then rapidly amplify this non - linear substructure during the subsequent quasi - freefall collapse .",
    "by contrast , if it is possible for a clump to condense quasistatically into the dust - domain , it arrives there in a rather too well organized state , and collapse seems likely to lead to a single star . under this circumstance ,",
    "binary formation may require some sort of intrinsic instability , for example in a circumstellar disc .",
    "support for the notion that even low - mass clumps either require an external perturbation to trigger their collapse , or condense rather quasistatically into the dust - domain before collapsing to form stars , comes from the observation ( myers , private communication ) that the majority of starless low - mass clumps are located in the outer reaches of taurus , where presumably external perturbations are few and far between .",
    "further support comes from the observation that in low - mass clumps associated with iras sources , the iras source ( i.e. the putative newly - formed star ) is normally significantly displaced from the centre of the ( presumably placental ) clump ( beichman et al .",
    "1986 , clark 1987 ) .",
    "high - mass ( @xmath115 ) clumps are supported mainly by non - thermal motions . from figure 2",
    ", it appears that they are unable to enter the dust - domain , without a substantial external impulse ",
    "most likely a shock , due to a collision with another comparable clump , or due to being overrun by an expanding nebula .",
    "a sufficiently strong shock would compress the gas to the point where it became thermally coupled to the dust .",
    "if our hypothesis is correct , this would lead to efficient fragmentation and the formation of a star - cluster .",
    "there is evidence that molecular clouds have an hierarchical structure , i.e. clumps nested within clumps .",
    "if this is so , a high - mass clump should be envisaged as an ensemble of lower - mass clumps .",
    "consequently , even when star formation is triggered in a high - mass clump ( by an external perturbation ) , most of the gas ending up in stars will probably reside in low - mass ( @xmath1 ) subclumps , and this should lead to a majority of the stars formed having masses in the range 0.2 to 0.5 @xmath9 .",
    "several authors ( rees 1976 , low & lynden - bell 1976 , silk 1977 ) have determined the minimum mass for star formation @xmath116 on the basis of opacity - limited fragmentation . with reference to figure 1 , this is equivalent to identifying @xmath116 with the smallest mass falling inside the dust - domain , and it yields a value @xmath118 .",
    "however , to reach this part of the dust - domain from the conditions obtaining inside a clump would require either ( i ) several consecutive fragmentation episodes , or ( ii ) a single fragmentation episode generating a very large number of pieces .",
    "numerical simulations ( larson 1978 ) suggest that dynamical fragmentation is a one - stage process , i.e. that during freefall gravity only amplifies the substructure which is present at the outset .",
    "this implies that ( i ) can not work , and that ( ii ) requires an external perturbation with improbably high power on high spatial frequencies .",
    "therefore we do not expect many stars with masses @xmath18 @xmath119 .",
    "the largest mass falling inside the dust - domain is @xmath120 .",
    "we speculate that this is because clumps having higher mass can not ( coherently ) enter the dust - domain , no matter what external perturbation they experience , and therefore can not collapse to form stars .      in figure 3",
    "we show how the dust - domain is altered on the ( @xmath23 ) plane , if one adopts a different far - infrared emissivity index for the dust , i.e. @xmath121 or @xmath122 .",
    "the only significant change is on the small-@xmath96 boundary of the dust - domain , where the dust is optically thick to its own radiation .",
    "since we are here more concerned with the large-@xmath96 boundary , this variation will not affect our conclusions significantly .    in figure 4",
    "we show how the dust - domain is altered on the ( @xmath23 ) plane , if one adopts a different background temperature , i.e. @xmath123 5 k ( instead of @xmath123 10 k ) , or a different metallicity , i.e. @xmath124 0.003 ( instead of @xmath124 0.01 . changing the background temperature has little effect on the boundary of the dust - domain where it is close to the locus of clumps .    reducing the metallicity moves the dust - domain to smaller @xmath96-values . unless the locus of clumps is also different , in the sense of being characterized by a larger mean column - density , this increases the gap between the dust - domain and the locus of clumps .",
    "consequently , where the metallicity is well below solar , it should be much harder for star formation to occur spontaneously .",
    "this might mean that star formation is more dependent on an external impulse , and hence that star formation is more likely to occur in bursts .",
    "this could dictate the pattern of star formation in a galaxy having low metallicity , for example a young galaxy or an irregular galaxy  in the sense of making star formation more burst - like .",
    "we have evaluated the conditions under which gas - cooling by dust enables a clump to collapse and fragment dynamically .",
    "we describe these conditions as the _ dust - domain_. we have also shown that in the dust - domain gas - cooling by dust dominates over gas - cooling by dust .",
    "the observed properties of clumps in star - forming molecular clouds are such that low - mass ( @xmath1 ) clumps are close to the dust - domain .",
    "consequently only a small external perturbation is needed to propel them into the dust - domain  and possibly no perturbation at all . therefore ,",
    "if such clumps fragment into binary or triple systems , with most of their mass ending up in the components of these systems , they will spawn stars having masses concentrated in the range 0.2 to 0.5 @xmath9 , which is the peak of the imf ( cf .",
    "larson 1995 ) .    in isolated quiescent regions ,",
    "low - mass cores may survive for long periods , for lack of a sufficient external impulse to trigger ( or accelerate ) their collapse .",
    "they would be observed as starless clumps .",
    "high - mass clumps require a substantial external impulse to reach the dust - domain and start collapsing .",
    "collisions with other clumps and/or shocks due to expanding nebulae can provide a sufficient impulse .",
    "this may be why star formation is ( apparently ) more efficient in dynamically agitated regions .",
    "consider a uniform medium with density @xmath125 and isothermal sound speed @xmath126 .",
    "now suppose that a spherical fragment having radius @xmath127 , and hence mass @xmath128 , attempts to condense out of the background by contracting homologously , so that it remains spherical with instantaneous radius @xmath96 , and uniform with instantaneous density @xmath129 .",
