    "the notable difference in the case of path iw , relative to iv , is that the degree of biaxiality ( value of @xmath67 ) remains fairly independent of temperature , and the degree is the same for all subsequent values of @xmath45 beyond this threshold , until interrupted by a second low temperature transition leading to an onset of appreciable biaxial order ( fig.[fig:3 ] ) .",

    "subsequently , the low temperature @xmath75 transition seems to change gradually from first order to continuous nature , as seen from @xmath57 profiles in figs.[fig:6 ] and [ fig:8 ] .",

    "we could report the @xmath76 data only upto the value @xmath77 , as beyond this value ( which falls into the partly repulsive region under the parabola ) the computational times for the convergence of dos are impractical .",
    "we observe from the temperature variation of order parameters that the growth of biaxial order appears to be progressively inhibited as @xmath45 value increases within the attractive region , and enters the party repulsive region on crossing the parabola at the point z. the free energy profiles , plotted as a function of energy and order parameters ( computed from the dos data ) , reflect the rationale for the impediments for the growth of the biaxial order as the base of the triangle oiw is reached .",

    ". however , its variation with respect to @xmath67 shows a small sharp well , ( the edge being located at @xmath79 ) , and the family of curves in fig.[fig:10c ] , as a function of temperature , shows that it required significant variation of temperature before the system could shift its free energy minimum away from this restricted region .",
    "it appears that during this temperature range , the system accesses microstates with rather small but nonzero degree of biaxiality , constrained however by free energy barriers to attain higher degree of biaxiality for considerable range of temperature .",
    "this circumstance seems to be manifesting as a corresponding curious variation of @xmath67 at @xmath45= 0.610 , as in fig.[fig : ] .",
    "we find that the development of such free energy barriers ( with respect to @xmath67 at low values ) and the requirement of the system to cool sufficiently to overcome them before accessing higher macroscopically observable values , is generic .",
    "all the data collected in this region supports and corroborates the simulated order parameter profiles reported in the previous figures .",
    "it is very interesting that such barriers are exhibited only along the path of biaxial order , but not along energy or uniaxial order .",
    "this implies a complex free energy surface in the 2-d space of order parameter , offering initial barriers to a significant development of biaxial order , until the system is sufficiently cooled",

    "the case for @xmath18 = 0 was studied earlier through simulations @xcite .",
    "it was found that in the absence of the biaxial - biaxial interaction term , only a uniaxial phase could be obtained on condensation from the isotropic phase .",
    "we present here the simulation results in the case of @xmath81 .",
    "the mean field analysis predicts that the hamiltonian is partly repulsive in this region and excluded volume effects play a major role @xcite .     for values of @xmath45 in the range 0.709 - 0.747 ( l=15 ) ]    due to the constraints imposed by computational time",

    "the energy cumulants @xmath57 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:15 ] .",
    "it may be observed that the specific heat profiles show evidences of two transitions .",
    "the order parameter profiles depict the onset and growth of uniaxial order at @xmath70 for all values of @xmath45 .",
    "the biaxial order parameter increases at @xmath69 ( in the biaxial phase ) for @xmath45 = 0.709 , but remains close to zero for @xmath45 = 0.740 and 0.747 .",
    "this behaviour is as expected from mean field considerations at such values of @xmath45 , very close to the base ow .",
    "the free energy plots for @xmath82 = 0.740 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:16a ] - [ fig:16c ] .",
    "the free energy variation with respect to @xmath67 for @xmath45 = 0.740 again confirms the presence of barriers for the growth of biaxial order at points close to the base ow . the biaxial state is obviously not stable at such parameter points of the hamiltonian",
    "in this paper , the interior of essential triangle is explored with entropic sampling method along a trajectory iw , a line drawn from apex i of the triangle to the mid point w of the base ov ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "we refer to the arc length oiw as @xmath45 , for purposes of discussion . as per mf treatment",
    "this line cuts both the trajectories of @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "thus the phase sequences along this line iw should be qualitatively similar to that on the @xmath18-axis . in particular the direct transition from isotropic to biaxial phase is expected to be interrupted by a uniaxial nematic phase beyond a value as @xmath44 increases , and the temperature range of the uniaxial phase should progressively increase , suppressing the second transition temperature , till the line cuts the parabola , at z ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "results from mean field treatment in the partly repulsive region on this line iw are not available for direct comparison , even though it is established that biaxial phase would not be stable at the point w @xcite .",
    "the phase sequences in the present work qualitatively follow this scenario , but with a curious deviation .",
    "the intervening `` uniaxial '' phase @xmath1 is not strictly devoid of biaxial symmetry .",
    "indeed all along the line , beyond @xmath83 ( fig.[fig : e1 ] ) , and upto point z , the onset of the uniaxial order is invariably accompanied by a small , but unmistakable , development of biaxial symmetry .",
    "we thus refer to this phase as @xmath73 , to make this subtle distinction . this small degree of biaxiality of the @xmath73 phase is temperature independent within that phase , and is also fairly independent of its location in the trajectory beyond @xmath83 .",
    "an examination of the free energy profiles , drawn as a function of both the major order parameters , show interesting features : while the free energy curves show smooth variation of the minima with respect to @xmath66 as the temperature is varied , the case of @xmath67 is qualitatively different .",
    "these profiles exhibit free energy barriers at low values of @xmath67 , which could be overcome ( thereby pushing the system to access regions of higher and discernible order ) , only after these initial barriers could be overcome on considerable cooling .",
    "thus these results show a complex free energy surface that develops with decrease of temperature on a typical trajectory inside the triangle .",
    "it appears that development of a @xmath73 phase with a small biaxial order ( @xmath72 is expected , and the degree of this symmetry is restricted by the free energy barriers till the system is permitted to access these regions of biaxial order .",
    "given that such barriers are strongly dependent on the size of the system , it is a plausible conjecture to suggest that in real systems these barriers are not readily overcome ( or equivalently , requires significant cooling of the medium ) , and hence their biaxial order appears to be restricted inherently . under such circumstances requiring wider",
    "temperature ranges to overcome barriers , real systems may have other competing interactions ( like translational degrees , influencing the phase sequence qualitatively differently , e.g layer formation ) .",
    "deviations of real systems from mf predictions @xcite could perhaps be understood in these terms ."
