    "optical processes taking place in @xmath0 media involve three light waves , yielding to a considerably rich variety of nonlinear phenomena , both in the semi - classical @xcite and in the quantum domain @xcite .",
    "the quantum statistical properties of the radiation coming out from such interactions have attracted much attention ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) . squeezing , anti - bunching and entanglement have been predicted and subsequently observed in a series of fascinating experiments @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical approaches to a quantum theory of three - waves devices have been carried out using the so - called parametric approximation @xcite . in this framework one of the field modes",
    "is in a strong semi - classical coherent state , so that its depletion as well as its quantum fluctuations can be neglected .",
    "a fully analytical treatment of the quantum dynamics is not available , whereas numerical methods have been developed in the cases of photon number @xcite or coherent input states @xcite . in this paper",
    "the three - wave dynamics is evaluated without approximation for arbitrary input states , resorting to the numerical block - diagonalization of the hamiltonian in invariant subspaces of the constants of motion .    in the rotating wave approximation",
    "the non - degenerate three - wave interactions are described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 \\label{ham}\\:,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the annihilation operators of the three relevant modes , whose frequencies satisfy the relation @xmath5 . depending on the input state of the field , the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) describes phase - insensitive amplification or frequency up- or down - conversion .",
    "the first kind of process occurs in situations with small @xmath2 and @xmath3 and large coherent @xmath4 , so that the pumping mode can be considered as undepleted and treated as a c - number , in the so - called parametric approximation . on the other hand , when all the three modes participates to the quantum dynamics we are in the presence of frequency up- and down - conversion processes .    in the present paper",
    "we are interested in the situation depicted in fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] , where the interaction hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is applied twice : in the first step as a parametric ( spontaneous ) down - conversion of the vacuum state , generating a twin - beam on modes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and in the second step as the up - conversion of twin - beam into mode @xmath4 .",
    "this scheme is of interest because , as shown in the following , the outgoing quantum state of radiation closely resembles the phase - coherent state ( pcs ) @xmath6 which has been introduced by shapiro _",
    "et al _ in ref .",
    "the phase - coherent states are interesting because they are optimum phase states for both the sssmann and the reciprocal peak likelihood @xcite measure of phase uncertainty @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", they also could serve as _ seed _ state @xcite in sampling canonical phase distribution by unconventional heterodyne detection @xcite . moreover",
    ", one should mention that the pcs maintain phase coherence under phase amplification @xcite , such that they are privileged states for phase - based communication channels .    in suggesting the present scheme we have been inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite , where an ideal scheme using a photon number duplicator ( pnd ) was suggested for pcs synthesis from twin - beam . as a matter of fact , in such photon recombination process the pnd is well approximated by the up - conversion from hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) with mode @xmath4 initially in the vacuum @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that the interaction scheme sketched in fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] is indeed effective for the generation of pcs .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ s : thr ] we briefly describe our approach to the evaluation of the dynamics of the three - wave interactions , and discuss the validity of the parametric approximation in the generation of twin - beam state . in section [ s : upc ] we analyze the performances of the twin - beam up - conversion in producing phase - coherent states in the second stage of the scheme of fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] .",
    "finally , section [ s : outro ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "the overall input state describing the three involved modes can be written in the fock basis as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an arbitrarily large integer , which denotes the largest not - negligible fock component . in order to compute the dynamical evolution of @xmath9 @xmath10 one should ,",
    "in principle , diagonalize the full hamiltonian matrix in the fock basis .",
    "this becomes a very difficult task when the truncation @xmath8 of the fock space increases , becoming unrealistic for @xmath8 exceeding few teens .",
    "however , one can notice that the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) admits two independent constants of motion .",
    "for the sake of convenience we choose them as the following ones @xmath11\\ : ,   \\quad\\quad \\hat k = a^{\\dag } a + c^{\\dag } c \\label{kost}\\:.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] conservation of @xmath12 and @xmath13 means that subspaces corresponding to given eigenvalues of these quantities are invariant under the action of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , as @xmath14=0 $ ] and @xmath15=0 $ ] .",
    "in other words , the hilbert space @xmath16 can be decomposed into the direct sum of subspaces that are invariant under the action of the unitary evolution operator in eq .",
    "( [ evol ] ) .",
    "such a decomposition can be written as follows @xmath17 where @xmath18 \\label{decbs2}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath19 denoting the hilbert space linearly spanned by the orthogonal vectors within the brackets , and @xmath20 representing the state which is simultaneously eigenvector of the number operator of the three modes .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) can be consistently rewritten as a follows @xmath21 with @xmath22 acting on @xmath23 only .",
    "correspondingly , the representation for @xmath24 can be written in the following fashion @xmath25 which enlightens the invariant subspaces structure . in this way",
    "one needs to diagonalize the hamiltonian only _ inside _ each invariant subspace , thus leading to a considerable saving of resources .    as a first application of the above method we look for the conditions under which the parametric approximation is justified in describing the process of frequency down - conversion between a strong semi - classical pump and the vacuum",
    "the input state is given by @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the amplitude of a considerably excited coherent state .",
    "in the parametric approximation the pump mode @xmath4 in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is replaced by the c - number @xmath28 , thus neglecting its quantum fluctuations as well its depletion . within such approximation the dynamics of the input state @xmath29",
    "is governed by the evolution operator @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 being the interaction time and @xmath33 the coupling constant containing the nonlinear susceptibility . the evolution governed by eq .",
    "( [ pia ] ) can be easily computed by means of the baker - haussdorff - campbell formula for the @xmath34 lie algebra @xcite , and the output is represented by the twin - beam state @xmath35 where @xmath36    in order to check the theoretical results predicted by the parametric approximation we consider the overlap @xmath37 between the state @xmath38 coming from the exact evolution and the expected twin - beam @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "[ f : fig2](a ) we show the behavior of the overlap as a function of the scaled interaction time @xmath40 for different values of the pump input power . in order to evaluate the efficiency of the process we also consider the energy conversion rate @xmath41 , which is defined as @xmath42 } { \\hbox{tr}\\left[\\hat\\varrho^{in}\\hat n_c\\right ] } \\label{conv}\\:,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 . in eq .",
    "( [ conv ] ) @xmath41 runs between zero and one , the factor @xmath44 coming from frequency conversion . in fig .",
    "[ f : fig2](b ) we show the behavior of @xmath41 as a function of the scaled interaction time @xmath45 for different values of the input power , as in fig . [ f : fig2](a ) .",
    "it is apparent that parametric approximation is valid also for moderate input power , and that one has a considerably wide range of values of the interaction time leading to an overlap very close to unit , the weaker is the pump , the larger is this range . on the other hand , these values of the interaction time correspond to a low conversion rate . by the way",
    ", we note that the interaction time leading to maximum conversion rate follows the relation @xmath46 .",
    "in this section we analyze the second step of the pcs generation setup reported in fig.[f : fig1 ] , namely the three - wave interaction starting from the twin - beam input state @xmath47 the complex amplitude @xmath48 is confined in the unit circle , and the mean photon number pertaining the state ( [ twbin ] ) is given by @xmath49 the synthesis of the pcs ( [ pcsdef ] ) starting from @xmath39 would be easily achieved by having at disposal a device that performs the photon number recombination @xmath50 such kind of transformation has been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and has been shown to correspond to the interaction hamiltonian @xmath51 unfortunately , the hamiltonian ( [ pnr ] ) can not be realized by known optical devices .",
    "however , one may notice that the perfect number recombination @xmath52 is performed by the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , and this suggests to substitute the intensity dependent factor in eq .",
    "( [ pnr ] ) by its expectation value . in spite of this rather crude approximation , the trilinear interaction ( [ ham ] ) has been shown @xcite to provide a good approximation of the photon recombination in the case of a single photon number state at the input . here",
    ", we analyze the case of the input twin - beam state ( [ twbin ] ) .",
    "our aim is to demonstrate that the scheme of fig .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] is indeed effective in synthesizing a pcs . as a parameter to evaluate the effectiveness of pcs synthesis we use the overlap @xmath53 between the state @xmath54 \\label{out}\\:,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] exiting the @xmath0 crystal in the mode @xmath4 and a theoretical pcs @xmath55 corresponding to the same mean photon number . in order to evaluate the efficiency of the process we also consider the conversion rate @xmath41 , defined as follows @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ f : fig3 ] we show the behavior of the overlap @xmath57 and the conversion rate @xmath41 as a function of the scaled interaction time for different intensity of the incoming twin - beam .",
    "a remarkable fact is apparent : interaction times corresponding to high conversion rate also optimize the overlap between the outgoing state and the theoretical pcs .",
    "this means that the up - conversion , although only approximated , produces a recombination process which is at the same time efficient and quite precise .",
    "one should also mention that for the same interaction times one has a small degree of mixing , indicating that the outgoing states are quite pure , and minimum reciprocal peak likelihood , thus confirming good phase - coherence properties .    in fig .",
    "[ f : fig4 ] we report the maximum overlap , along with the corresponding interaction time and conversion rate , as a function of the twin - beam input energy @xmath58 .",
    "the overlap @xmath57 slowly decreases versus the input energy @xmath59 , whereas the conversion rate @xmath41 is almost independent on this quantity , saturating to a value close to @xmath60 .",
    "this results in a reliable generation of pcs with overlap between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , for outgoing states with energy @xmath62 up to @xmath63 mean photon number .",
    "the corresponding reciprocal peak likelihood @xmath64 shows the scaling @xmath65 which , though it is worse than the ideal pcs performances @xmath66 , it is far superior to the coherent state level @xmath67 .",
    "the interaction time @xmath68 , which corresponds to the maximum overlap , decreases with the input energy @xmath59 . by a best fit on data in fig .",
    "[ f : fig4 ] we obtained the scaling power - law @xmath69 .",
    "remarkably , the same scaling is observed as a function of the output energy @xmath70 , with only a slight change in the proportionality constant @xmath71 .",
    "in this paper we have suggested a scheme to generate the phase - coherent states introduced in ref .",
    "the setup involves two @xmath0 nonlinear crystals and it is based on parametric amplification of the vacuum followed by up - conversion of the resulting twin - beam , the up - conversion playing the role of an approximate photon number recombination .",
    "we found that parametric approximation in down - conversion of the vacuum state is valid also for moderate input power , and that one has a considerably wide range of values of the interaction time leading to an overlap very close to unit , the weaker is the pump , the larger is this range .",
    "these values of the interaction time correspond to a low conversion rate . on the other hand",
    ", we found that the up - conversion process involved in the second step of the scheme is both power - efficient and quite precise in the generation of pcs .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that the range of interaction times leading to high conversion rate also optimize the overlap between the outgoing state and the theoretical pcs .",
    "we have explored the case of twin - beam input photon number ranging from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , and we have observed a conversion rate about @xmath60 , with an overlap with ideal pcs between @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this corresponds to a reliable generation of pcs up to @xmath63 photons at the output .",
