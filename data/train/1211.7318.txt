    "in past decades , systems in a magnetic field ( @xmath6 ) have been useful laboratories to test theoretical ideas .",
    "a famous example is a system of cold atoms , in which a magnetic field controls the strength of the interactions . in qcd",
    ", similar utilities are also expected for the lattice monte carlo simulation at finite @xmath6 @xcite . in particular , we can study the nonperturbative gluon dynamics through polarization effects , controlling quark dynamics by a magnetic field .",
    "such information may help the studies of cold , dense quark matter @xcite .",
    "it seems that lattice studies already confirmed some of the theoretical ideas . at @xmath7 , a magnetic field enhances the size of the chiral condensate due to magnetic catalysis @xcite .",
    "a key feature of this phenomenon is the effective dimensional reduction . for @xmath8 ,",
    "the phase space for the low energy particles and anti - particles is @xmath9 , increasing the number of participants to the formation of the chiral condensate .",
    "this should be contrast to the @xmath10 case , where phase space quickly decreases as @xmath11 in the infrared region . in this case , due to the small number of participants ,",
    "the system needs sufficiently strong attractive forces to form chiral condensates .    on the other hand ,",
    "some surprises have been provided as well @xcite . while @xmath6 increases the chiral condensate below the ( pseudo-)critical temperatures for the chiral restoration ( @xmath12 ) and deconfinement ( @xmath13 ) , those temperatures themselves decrease .",
    "this might contradict with our intuitions , if we think that a larger chiral condensate should generate a greater quark mass gap .",
    "such thinking would suggest that ( i ) a larger quark mass gap should suppress thermal quark fluctuations , leading to increasing @xmath12 , and ( ii ) a larger quark mass gap suppresses quark loops , so that the results should approach to the pure gauge results , leading to increasing @xmath13 .    to resolve this apparent contradiction",
    ", we shall argue that the quark mass gap at @xmath7 can stay around @xmath1 ( or less ) for large @xmath6 .",
    "then we can imagine that the gap at @xmath14 also stays around @xmath1 , without strongly suppressing thermal quark fluctuations and quark loops .",
    "if this is the case , the decreasing of critical temperatures would not be so unnatural .",
    "in addition , the aforementioned behavior of the quark mass gap does not contradict with the growing behavior of the chiral condensate , but instead naturally explains its @xmath6-dependence at @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , the lattice results in @xcite showed the behavior @xmath15 , for @xmath16 . noting that the relation under the landau quantization , @xmath17 we can see that @xmath18 or the quark mass gap must be nearly @xmath6-independent and @xmath19 . in this work",
    "we will carry out all the calculations in the large @xmath20 limit limit in a magnetic field was also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite from a different perspective from ours . ] .",
    "the use of the large @xmath20 is motivated by at least three reasons : ( i ) at large @xmath20 , gluons are not screened , so the _ nonperturbative _ forces ( i.e. the forces in the infrared ) are stronger than the @xmath21 case . such forces can be used to set the _ upper bound _ of the quark mass gap .",
    "( ii ) the large @xmath20 limit has captured many qualitative aspects of the confined phase at @xmath10 .",
    "therefore it is worth thinking and testing this approximation in the confined phase at finite @xmath6 , since its validity and invalidity are not evident _ apriori_. ( iii ) it is easy to imagine how the @xmath22 corrections _ qualitatively _ modify the large @xmath20 results , and such corrections just provide welcomed effects for our scenario ( see below ) .",
    "we will use the large @xmath20 limit to just claim that the quark mass gap does not grow much beyond @xmath23 . to explain the reduction of the critical temperatures , in addition we have to argue the @xmath22 corrections .",
    "the quark loops as the @xmath22 corrections screen the nonperturbative forces . as @xmath6 increases ,",
    "the screening effects become larger because more low energy particles can participate to the gluon polarization , due to the enhanced landau degeneracy @xmath24 in the lowest landau level ( lll ) @xcite .",
    "if the quark mass gap stops growing as suggested in our scenario , there is nothing to suppress the growth of the screening effects as @xmath6 increases , the nonperturbative gluons will be screened out at some critical value of @xmath6 such that the screening mass , @xmath25 , becomes comparable to @xmath23 ( see also sec.[conclusion ] ) . ]",
    ". therefore the nonperturbative forces are reduced at large @xmath6 , and such reduction should lower the critical temperatures for given @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , hadronic fluctuations as the @xmath22 corrections also grow as @xmath6 increases , helping the chiral symmetry to restore @xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite , where chiral perturbation theory should be at work . ] .",
    "we will argue that the demanded ( nearly ) @xmath6-independent gap of o(@xmath23 ) can be derived , provided that it is dominantly created by the nonperturbative force mediated by the ir gluons .",
    "in particular , both the ir enhancement ( that is more drastic than the perturbative @xmath26 case ) and the uv suppression of the gluon exchanges are crucial for our discussions . since we will deal with the lll which is essentially soft physics in the present paper , ir enhanced gluon is a key feature in this study ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "if we include only the perturbative @xmath26 force , the gap is much smaller than @xmath23 and depends on @xmath6 at most logarithmically .",
    "similar arguments have been used in studies of the quark mass function at finite quark density @xcite .    to illustrate our points ,",
    "we first consider the njl model which does not have the abovementioned properties . for @xmath27 , the gap equation within the lll approximation is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is some uv regulator function .",
    "the contact interaction couples all states in the lll so that the landau degeneracy factor @xmath30 for the lll appears .",
    "the intrinsic property of the model is that the chiral condensate has the same @xmath6-dependence as the mass gap : @xmath31 depending on the regularization schemes , @xmath32 can be @xmath33 ( proper time regularization @xcite ) , or @xmath34 ( four momentum cutoff @xcite ) , or else .",
    "each scheme has its own problems . for schemes predicting the growing behavior of the chiral condensate @xcite",
    ", the quark mass gap also develops as @xmath6 increases .",
    "then at finite temperature , thermal quark contributions are largely reduced so that the increasing chiral restoration temperature is naturally expected . on the other hand ,",
    "if the mass gap approaches to constant , the chiral condensate also does , contradicting with the lattice results .",
    "therefore , as far as the relation like ( [ njlrelation ] ) is retained , it seems that we have to abandon either the increasing chiral condensate or the reduction of critical temperatures .",

    "in contrast to the previous case , the factor @xmath30 does not appear in front of the integral . this is because the interaction ( [ model ] ) does not couple all the states in the lll , but couples the states having similar momenta ( fig.[fig : sdeq]b ) .",
    "this feature makes the gap @xmath6-independent .",
    "in fact , carrying out the integral over the transverse momenta , we get @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "note that the equation does not have any explicit @xmath6 dependence , so the mass gap is solely determined by the scale @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath43 .",
    "another important feature is the damping behavior of the mass function at large @xmath44 . to see this , in ( [ damping ] ) we take @xmath45 , for which @xmath46 must go to @xmath47 .",

    "the chiral condensate depends on @xmath6 _ linearly _ , as advertised .",
    "note that all of the discussions presented so far did not ask whether the interaction is confining or not .",
    "all we needed was the ir enhancement .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to further investigate a model which not only contains properties of the ir enhancement , but also captures certain aspects of the confinement . for this purpose",
    ", we will use the model of gribov - zwanziger @xcite which contains the linear rising potential between colored charges .",
    "confinement is expressed as the absence of the quark continuum in the meson spectra .",

    "this is natural consequence of the gauge invariance , @xmath89 , that affects the origin of @xmath86 and @xmath87 but should not affect the final result .",
    "this complicated expression can be drastically simplified if ( i ) the interaction shows an ir enhancement around @xmath1 , while it damps quickly in the uv , and ( ii ) the magnetic field is sufficiently strong , @xmath90 .",
    "the gluon propagator rapidly damps for @xmath91 and @xmath92 much larger than @xmath23 , cutting off the domain of integral .",

    "the final expression itself coincides with a naive expectation and is not surprising . ultimately , as @xmath5 a hopping from one landau orbit to others ( transverse dynamics ) is completely suppressed . a nontrivial consequence of the asymptotic free theories , however , is that the separation of the landau levels is achieved at a relatively small magnetic field , compared to forces like @xmath26 . for the @xmath26 force ,",
    "the damping of the uv force is much milder so that the lll and higher levels do not decouple quickly .",
