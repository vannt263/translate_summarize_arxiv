    "this paper deals with the asymptotic distribution theory of functional canonical correlations and their variates .",
    "although tailored to these particular problems , the methodology is of a generic character and may also apply to questions regarding the asymptotic distribution of other statistics used in functional data analysis .",
    "the problem will be formulated in a general hilbert space setting where the hilbert space is tacitly assumed to be infinite - dimensional and separable .    in this infinite - dimensional case ,",
    "some difficulties regarding the definition of the sample canonical correlation have already been observed in leurgans _",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the authors of that paper argue that some kind of smoothing or regularization is indispensable when dealing with the sample canonical correlation .",
    "these difficulties are essentially due to the fact that the sample covariance operator has a so - called finite - dimensional kernel ( riesz and sz .- nagy ( @xcite ) ) , while acting on an infinite - dimensional space .",
    "( @xcite ) realize smoothing by introducing a roughness penalty term .",
    "although there is a connection between tikhonov regularization of inverse operators ( employed in this paper ) and the use of penalty terms , the relation with the roughness penalty can not be established within the present context of our paper .",
    "( @xcite ) apply dimension reduction / augmentation at the level of the actual data and base the empirical canonical correlation on these modified data .",
    "this approach differs considerably from ours , which is based on regularization of the canonical correlation itself .",
    "the results in he _",
    "( @xcite ) are for fixed sample size and the asymptotics in leurgans _",
    "( @xcite ) remain restricted to consistency .",
    "in @xcite it has been observed that the population canonical correlation , although well defined in principle , is , in general , a supremum of a certain functional , rather than a maximum , so that a maximizer ( i.e. , a pair of canonical variates ) may not always exist in the ambient hilbert space .",
    "another deficiency is that , even if the canonical correlation corresponds to a maximum and canonical variates do exist , these quantities can not be interpreted as the maximum eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of a pair of associated operators , as is true in the euclidean setting .",
    "the development in @xcite shows that all of these deficiencies of the population canonical correlation can be remedied if a modification is employed , based on regularization of the inverses of the operators involved .",
    "also , some relations between the actual population quantities and their regularized versions are established in that paper .    the present approach to finding the asymptotic distribution of the regularized sample canonical correlation and its variates hinges to a great extent on the interpretation of both the regularized sample and the regularized population quantities as spectral characteristics of associated pairs of operators . in section  [ sec4 ] of this paper , the asymptotic distribution of a regularized version of the sample canonical correlation and its variates will be derived . in the euclidean case , where regularization is not needed , this approach has been pursued in ruymgaart and yang ( @xcite ) , exploiting certain results in watson ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main tools needed to derive the desired asymptotics is a delta - method for analytic functions of certain random operators ( more specifically , sample covariance operators ) .",
    "this delta - method might be of independent interest and is considered in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "it is based on the existence of a frchet derivative of an analytic function of a compact , strictly positive hermitian operator , tangentially to the space of all compact hermitian operators .",
    "because we can not make the simplifying assumption that the increments commute with the operator at which the function is evaluated , the expression for the frchet derivative requires an extra correction term .",
    "the delta - method yields the asymptotic distribution of the associated operators , from which the asymptotics of their eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be derived in a similar manner as in dauxois _",
    "( @xcite ) .    as has been observed above , without regularization , the population canonical variates do not , in general , exist and , consequently , it seems appropriate to maintain a fixed level of regularization for suitable asymptotics .",
    "mathematically , a fixed level of regularization leads to root - sample - size asymptotics .",
    "when the regularization parameter tends to zero , however , this rate will depend on the ( typically unknown ) eigenvalues of the covariance operator .    in section [ sec2 ] , some basic notation and definitions",
    "are introduced . for practical implementation of the results of section  [ sec4 ] , the estimation of unknown parameters will be needed , an issue addressed in section  [ sec5 ] .",

    "_ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "these authors state that regularization is indispensable in the sample case .",
    "the canonical correlation concept considered here can also be viewed from the perspective of hilbert - space - indexed processes ( e.g. , parzen ( @xcite ) ) corresponding to @xmath1 inner products involving the random elements @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "thus , it has direct ties to ( functional ) analysis of variance and discriminant analysis that parallel the relationship between these methods for classical multivariate analysis ( e.g. , kshirsagar ( @xcite ) , eubank and hsing ( @xcite ) and shin ( @xcite ) ) .",
