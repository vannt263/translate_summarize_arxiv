    "the milky way galactic plane has long been known to be a strong source of diffuse gamma - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the energetic gamma ray emission telescope ( egret ) instrument on the compton gamma - ray observatory satellite measured this emission over the full sky and for energies in the range @xmath2 gev , with reasonably high resolution in each bin ( * ? ? ? * where the data are reported with angular bins of width 0.5 degree and with several logarithmically - spaced bins per decade in energy ) .",
    "it was expected that a very significant component of the diffuse emission would arise from the decays of neutral pions ( @xmath3 ) , arising from the collisions of hadronic cosmic rays with the hadronic component of the interstellar medium ( i.e. , @xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we refer to these throughout the paper as `` pionic '' gamma rays , to distinguish them from gamma rays produced by leptonic processes , e.g. , the inverse - compton upscattering of ambient photons by very high - energy electrons .    the spatial variation of the pionic component of the diffuse galactic gamma - ray emission should track the column density of the interstellar medium .",
    "however , since other sources of gamma rays also depend , though in more complicated ways , on the imprecisely - known distribution of interstellar matter and radiation , it is difficult to extract the pionic component by its spatial dependence alone .",
    "however , the energy spectrum of the pionic gamma rays has a characteristic shape , which follows from the kinematics of the boosted pion decays and the convolution with the hadronic cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "this shape is symmetrical ( when plotted as @xmath5 vs @xmath6 ) about the `` pion bump '' peak at @xmath7 gev , with long power - law tails to higher and lower energies @xcite .",
    "since no strong evidence of this bump was seen , @xcite estimated the maximum pionic fraction of the diffuse galactic gamma - ray emission to be @xmath8 .",
    "this is supported by the very detailed and comprehensive study of the galactic gamma - ray emission by @xcite .",
    "that study indicates that a key second feature of pionic gamma rays is that at high energies ( certainly by @xmath9 tev ) they should dominate the total emission and their slope will follow that of the hadronic cosmic rays .",
    "( the emission at energies below the bump is expected to be subdominant to the leptonic components . ) in the gev energy range , a significant component of the observed egret data is not well explained , and this discrepancy , which is observed in all sky directions , is known as the  gev excess \" @xcite .    in this paper , we consider constraints on the pionic gamma rays from experiments operating at much higher energies than egret .",
    "there are upper limits on the total gamma - ray emission near both tev ( @xmath10 gev ) and pev ( @xmath11 gev ) energies . depending on assumptions about the slope of the hadronic cosmic ray spectrum , these place at least somewhat restrictive limits on the pionic gamma - ray emission . however , the most exciting recent development is the first positive _ detection _ of diffuse gamma - ray emission from the galactic plane , by the milagro collaboration @xcite .",
    "they find @xmath12 in the galactic plane region of longitude @xmath13 and latitude @xmath14 .",
    "the basic question of the present paper is `` what is the origin of the ( apparently ) diffuse flux observed by milagro ? '' .",
    "the milagro collaboration argued that their result is consistent with being purely pionic in origin , though they note that some of the flux may arise from unresolved point or extended sources @xcite .",
    "as we will argue in steps of increasing detail , their result appears to be _ too large _ to be purely pionic , and thus seems to indicate a new mystery of galactic gamma rays , which we will call the  tev excess . \"",
    "our gev  tev ",
    "pev overview perspective is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] . in brief ,",
    "our arguments are as follows :    1 .",
    "we can simply extrapolate the last egret points to higher energies , and the milagro result should not exceed this trend  and while it does not , it could not be any larger .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] as the solid line .",
    "this alone indicates that a strong inverse compton component at high energies is disfavored @xcite , in agreement with considerations at lower energies @xcite . in the pev range",
    ", this extrapolation appears to be at best barely allowed , and is possibly excluded , depending on the choice of the hadronic cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "2 .   a more sophisticated approach is to only extrapolate the pionic component to high energies , where it should dominate .",
    "we first consider a pionic component of maximal normalization ( while this is unrealistically high , it is in fact _ lower _ than the normalization obtained if the gev egret data is effectively assumed to be purely pionic , as above ) . we allow two choices for the hadronic cosmic ray energy spectrum slope at high energies , as shown by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] .",
    "the first , with index @xmath15 ( for @xmath16 ) , is motivated by the slope chosen by the milagro collaboration , which provides a good single - parameter fit joining the highest - energy egret points to the milagro point .",
    "we argue below that the physics of pionic emission suggests that this is an unrealistically shallow spectrum if the observed gev  tev signal is indeed pionic .",
    "when we instead choose @xmath17 , in accordance with the locally observed cosmic rays @xcite , we find that the milagro measurement is 5 times _ larger _ than the _ maximal _ pionic flux allowed at 3.5 tev .",
    "the pev limits are on the verge of ruling out ( or detecting ! ) the pionic signal , regardless of the choice of @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , when the pev limits are derived using local cosmic ray spectrum , this rules out the continuation of gev - tev @xmath15 gamma - ray power law to pev energies .",
    "3 .   more realistically , the normalization of the pionic component should be even lower , at most @xmath8 of maximal in the `` optimized '' model of @xcite designed to minimize the gev excess .",
    "on the other hand , the `` conventional '' model of @xcite , which uses the locally observed cosmic - ray spectrum and normalization , comes somewhat closer to the egret data near the pionic maximum at @xmath19 , but leaves the gev excess ( thus motivating the non - standard optimized model ) .",
    "the results from the conventional model appear as the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the gev excess of the conventional model allows room for a large component of gamma rays from dark matter annihilation products ( including pions , though we reserve the word  pionic \" to refer to pions produced by cosmic ray collisions with the interstellar medium ) .",
    "these gamma rays from dark matter are claimed to help ameliorate the gev excess ( note that their spectrum abruptly ends below the dark matter mass of 50100 gev ) .",
    "we point out here that this interpretation _ increases _ the tev excess , making the milagro measurement about 10 times larger than the pionic component .",
    "thus , taking a realistic normalization and slope for the pionic component , we find that the milagro measurement seems to indicate a tev excess , which would be even more interesting than their conclusion that their result may be consistent with being purely pionic .",
    "our arguments are supported by the gamma - ray flux limits at pev energies .",
    "the diffuse gamma - ray data is summarized in ",
    "[ sect : data ] . in ",
    "[ sect : analysis ] we analyze the consistency of the data with diffuse pionic emission , and explore the possibility of unresolved sources contributing significantly to the milagro measurement .",
    "we go on in  [ sect : discuss ] to show how the framework of the gev ",
    "pev galactic gamma - ray emission can be tested in detail .",
    "we conclude in  [ sect : conclude ] with an observational strategy which uses present and upcoming gamma - ray experiments to disentangle the nature of diffuse galactic gamma - ray sources , both pionic and otherwise .",
    "the resolution of the outstanding issues has important implications for more than just the pionic gamma rays , and will shed new light on galactic cosmic rays in numerous ways : it will probably finally detect , and at least strongly constrain , the presence and interactions of hadronic cosmic rays throughout the galactic interstellar medium ; it will constrain the origin , source distribution , and spectra of both hadronic and leptonic cosmic rays ; and it will thereby sharpen our account of the galactic cosmic ray energy budget and thus the efficiency of cosmic ray accelerators .",
    "furthermore , a detailed and quantitative understanding of astrophysical sources of diffuse galactic gamma - rays will greatly clarify the existence and nature of any other galactic sources , such as dark matter . and",
    "finally , a good understanding of galactic gamma - rays will allow for this foreground to be better subtracted to obtain the diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray background .",
    "the milagro gamma - ray observatory is a ground - based water erenkov detector in new mexico that collects air - shower particles created when high - energy particles interact in the atmosphere ; showers initiated by gamma - rays and hadrons can be statistically distinguished by how they register in the detector @xcite .",
    "the milagro collaboration recently reported a diffuse flux @xmath20 of gamma rays from the galactic plane region @xmath21 and latitude @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "note that this emission is integrated over both higher energies and also the entire angular region , where no resolved sources were detected @xcite .",
    "in fact , to obtain the galactic plane diffuse emission milagro did not directly measure the gamma - ray flux , but rather the ratio of electromagnetic to hadronic showers .",
    "furthermore , their measurement was made by subtracting the off - source and on - source ( galactic plane ) fluxes , in order to cancel the isotropic cosmic - ray component ; this also cancels the extragalactic gamma - ray background , which is at the otherwise relatively high level @xmath22 gev @xmath23 s@xmath24 sr@xmath24 ( compare in fig .  [",
    "fig : all ] ) .",
    "an independent measurement of the hadronic cosmic - ray flux was then taken to derive the gamma - ray flux , and the result also depends on the assumed spectral indices of each species .",
    "we note that for the hadronic cosmic rays , milagro adopts the conventional observed value @xmath17 .",
    "the milagro collaboration reports that their result is consistent with the diffuse emission extrapolated from egret , assuming a spectral index @xmath15 , which is taken from the last four points of the egret integral spectrum @xcite .",
    "this single - parameter fit provides a good description of these data .",
    "( by extrapolating from the egret differential spectrum , our fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] highlights the uncertainty in this procedure , that is , it demonstrates how a small change in the assumed spectral index can be important over a large energy range . )",
    "the apparent success of a single power law over this large energy baseline is very suggestive that the emission at these energies is dominated by a single source .",
    "in particular , given the understanding of how the various components of the diffuse emission change with energy from @xcite , one sees that this effectively assumes that all of the egret gev data is pionic .",
    "however , the milagro collaboration is careful to note that their result could have a contribution from unresolved point or extended sources @xcite .",
    "this first detection of diffuse emission at tev energies invites a detailed comparison with other data . in our analysis",
    ", we will start with the assumption that milagro detection corresponds to truly diffuse pionic emission , and then investigate the validity and consequences of this .",
    "the egret data covers the range @xmath25 and is publicly available from the nasa archives in the form of integral gamma - ray fluxes ( in a given energy bin ) at a given galactic coordinate where the coordinate step is @xmath26 .",
    "we have taken those data points that fall into the milagro region @xmath27 , and averaged them for each energy bin .",
    "finally , we have determined the egret gamma - ray flux at the mean energy for each bin , where the underlying assumption is that the flux is energy - independent over the width of a bin .",
    "this is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] with red data points .",
    "following @xcite , we took fixed fractional uncertainties of @xmath28 on the fluxes ( since these are predominantly systematic in nature , they do not change when the field of view changes ) .",

    "we also consider the upper limits on gamma - ray fluxes from other high - energy experiments .",

    ", it is expected that the diffuse galactic emission is purely pionic , and hence scales with the column density @xcite .",
    "then fluxes from different regions of the galactic plane , if corrected for differences in column density , can be made _ physically equivalent _",

    "were we to raise the pionic prediction to meet the milagro and high - energy egret signals , the result would overshoot the egret signal below 1 gev .",
    "this result on the pionic normalization , supported by the more detailed work of @xcite , indicates that it is not realistic to simply extrapolate the egret data into the tev range , where the pionic component should be dominant . at the very least ,",

    "while the spectral index fit of @xmath15 is quite suggestive for connecting the egret and milagro observations , it is not consistent with local observations of the hadronic cosmic rays , which instead suggest @xmath17 . over the long lever arm of @xmath9 gev to @xmath9 tev",

    "inverse compton scattering makes a significant contribution at gev energies , but in the tev regime it declines rapidly , and is much smaller than the pionic gamma - ray flux @xcite . in the @xcite proposed scenario , the gev excess originates from the annihilation of dark matter particles with mass @xmath61 gev . in this case",

    "this result follows from the physics of pion production and decay , and is independent of any detailed galactic model . moreover , pionic emission is the only conventional source at tev energies .",
    "but the pionic spectral shape and the gev egret data together constrain the pionic emission to fall below the milagro tev signal by at least a factor of @xmath109 when using a pionic spectrum arising from cosmic rays as locally observed ; even without requiring consistency with the local cosmic - rays , the deficit is at least a factor of @xmath54 .",

    "more precisely , in the region of the sky observed by milagro we have noted ten unidentified egret sources . to estimate their gamma - ray flux at @xmath111",
    "we have used their spectral information as determined by egret and extrapolated into the tev energy range .",
    "we found that the total combined gamma - ray flux of these ten egret sources exceeds the diffuse galactic plane tev gamma - ray flux observed by milagro by about an order of magnitude .",
    "this suggests that extrapolation of the egret sources to tev energies has to fail at some point .",
    "four of these sources have been observed at tev energies , and one has been shown to break by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "however , until all of those point sources are surveyed at tev energies , we can not say more about their possible contribution to the tev excess .",
    "the possibility of a spectral break for at least some galactic point sources might have important implications . if galactic point sources ( presumably , supernova remnants ) are the dominant source of galactic cosmic - ray protons at tev energies then the shape of the diffuse pionic gamma - ray spectrum should track that of individual galactic point sources .",
    "that is , if there is a break or a cutoff somewhere between @xmath112 and @xmath113 in gamma - ray spectra of these sources that should carry over to spectra of cosmic rays accelerated in them . in that case",
    "the break in the spectrum is a measure of maximal snr acceleration energy .",
    "moreover , this would imply that another cosmic - ray component ( or reacceleration ) is required to come in before the @xmath114 tev cosmic - ray `` knee , '' contrary to conventional models .      in this paper",
    "we have tested the consistency of the model proposed by @xcite with the diffuse galactic plane tev gamma - ray observation of @xcite .",
    "this model requires a conventional pionic component in order for the gev excess to originate from wimp annihilation .",
    "we found that such a pionic component will then be able to account for only @xmath115 of the milagro tev gamma - ray flux .",
    "thus , although the gev excess could be explained this way , there still will be a potential tev excess .",
    "however , due to large uncertainties regarding point source contribution to milagro tev gamma - ray flux of egret sources , our model - independent analysis is unable to rule @xcite model in or out , on the basis of gamma - rays alone . on the other hand ,",
    "the recent analysis by @xcite does claim to exclude the @xcite model on the basis of antiproton fluxes .",
    "@xcite has proposed that dark matter annihilations may account for both the egret gev excess and the wmap galactic haze , through the inverse - compton and synchrotron energy losses of electrons and positrons produced in the annihilations .",
    "though the mechanism of producing the gev gamma rays is different from that of @xcite , in both cases the gamma - ray spectrum is cut off at energies above the dark matter mass , presumably @xmath116 gev .",
    "some of the existing and upcoming gamma - ray experiments will be able to answer the questions we have raised .",
    "namely , the gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will make observations in the @xmath117 energy band , which means that it will go about an order of magnitude higher in energy than egret , and will thus have the first view into this `` unopened window '' in energy .",
    "this will give new understanding of how gev and tev diffuse galactic plane gamma - ray observations connect .",
    "it will tell us more about the nature of the gev excess and how high it extends in energy .",
    "in particular , glast observations of diffuse emission could find a break in the diffuse gamma - ray spectrum , which would point to the nature of the gev excess .",
    "though a potential break could be due to high inverse compton component @xcite , it could also have a dark matter origin ; the shapes of two spectra may differ enough to make separation possible .",
    "glast observations of point sources at such high energies should uncover the break in their spectra implied by the overproduction of tev gamma - rays when gev data are extrapolated without a break ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sources ] ) . a possible break ,",
    "along with in general a better determination of point source spectra , could place strong constraints and possibly give a definite answer about the existence of the diffuse tev excess .",
    "discovering a break in the spectra of supernova remnants in particular would immediately have important consequences for the nature of galactic cosmic rays and thus hadronic gamma - rays .",
    "this feature would indicate a maximum cosmic ray energy which then should also limit galactic cosmic rays accelerated by supernovae .",
    "any cosmic rays above such energies must be accelerated from other sources , galactic or otherwise .    the very energetic radiation imaging telescope array system ( veritas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will complement and partially overlap with glast by observing in the energy range of 50 gev ",
    "veritas enjoys greater flux sensitivity compared to milagro .",
    "consequently , veritas should better determine the intensity of diffuse galactic plane gamma - ray emission .",
    "at least as important , veritas has far better point source sensitivity , which results in far lower contamination by unresolved point sources .",
    "all of this will allow veritas to place strong constraint on the possible diffuse nature of the tev excess and in turn constrain the pionic gamma - ray component .",
    "the high - energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) is already surveying point sources @xcite .",
    "its sensitivity is similar to veritas , and thus it is in the position to already answer some of these questions . although it is located in the southern hemisphere , and does not observe the same region of the galactic plane as milagro , an independent measurement of the diffuse gamma - ray flux would help resolve some of the issues we have presented in this paper .",
    "a possible diffuse galactic plane gamma - ray measurement made by hess could be used to check for consistency with egret observations , in a similar way as presented in this paper .",
    "the much better angular resolution of hess compared to milagro would give a result far less dependent on the unresolved point sources .",
    "thus , a potential discovery of a diffuse tev excess even in this case would then tell us a lot about the nature of this excess .",
    "we also note that the magic telescope , a very large atmospheric imaging erenkov telescope , has a very low energy threshold , down to 30 gev @xcite , and will thus also be a powerful probe .",
    "moreover , very recently , the hess collaboration has reported the discovery of an apparently diffuse flux from a very small region at the galactic center @xcite .",
    "while near 200 gev , this flux is similar to expectations , it falls off less steeply ( @xmath118 instead of 2.75 ) , reaching an excess of at least a factor 10 near 10 tev . while the spectrum here is falling less",
    "steeply than that which would be required to explain the milagro tev excess , the remarkable similarity of the excess suggests that a common origin is possible , e.g. , perhaps due to source cosmic rays @xcite . note",
    "that milagro has only measured a single point  the flux above 3.5 tev  and hence can not yet distinguish between possible new spectra emerging near that energy .",
    "if the enhanced gamma ray flux seen by milagro indeed arises from neutral pion decays , as in the model of @xcite with enhanced high - energy cosmic ray fluxes near sources , then it _ must _ be accompanied by an equally enhanced flux of neutrinos from charged pion decays .",
    "( in proton - proton collisions at high energies , neutral and charged pions are produced in comparable numbers ; the neutral pions decay to two gamma rays , and the charged pions ultimately decay to three neutrinos and an electron or positron . )",
    "the same conclusion would hold if the tev flux excess is due to dark matter annihilations @xcite or unresolved sources in which the gamma rays are produced by pion decays . if the excess gamma rays are produced leptonically , by inverse compton scattering , there will not be accompanying enhanced neutrino fluxes .",
    "these considerations may allow new tests of the tev excess in icecube and other large neutrino detectors @xcite , for which the detection prospects would be enhanced by a factor approaching 10 , and more if the excess persists to higher energies .",
    "finally , as we have emphasized , gamma - ray energy spectra provide the most direct and model - independent probe of pionic production and hence hadronic cosmic rays .",
    "however , the sky distribution of course also provides important clues @xcite , and the warp in the galactic plane may be helpful for separating the pionic gamma - ray component . since the cosmic rays are believed to be isotropic within the galaxy , the pionic component of the gamma ray flux should be proportional to the column density of gas along the line of sight , whereas the inverse compton component depends on the radiation density .",
    "three - dimensional models of the galactic neutral hydrogen density , revealed by the doppler - shifted 21-cm line emission , show that the galactic plane is strongly warped at radii @xmath119 kpc @xcite .",
    "some evidence of this warp can be seen in neutral hydrogen column density maps @xcite , showing up as an excursion to positive latitudes near galactic longitude @xmath120 and an excursion to negative latitudes near @xmath121 . in the energy range corresponding to pionic gamma rays",
    ", these same features should be seen .",
    "while some evidence of this effect was noted earlier @xcite , it appears to be easiest to see in the new egret maps of @xcite , which are shown for several energy ranges ( note the high - resolution figures are only available online ) . here",
    "the warp effect can be quite easily seen in several of the maps , which probably implies that the distribution of all gas is similar to that of neutral hydrogen alone .",
    "besides offering some hope to separate the pionic component with spatial information , the non - trivial geometry would allow for the first time some information about distances along the line of sight .",
    "while our comments here are only qualitative , we are unaware of any published correlation of the egret and 21-cm maps .",
    "the future glast mission , with significantly better sensitivity and angular resolution , should allow much more detailed studies .",
    "the nature and origin of the diffuse gamma - ray emission from our galaxy at gev energies @xcite has become an increasingly pressing problem , with the gev excess @xcite seeming to demand new astrophysics ( e.g. , high - energy cosmic - ray populations ) or new physics ( annihilating dark matter ) .",
    "the milagro detection @xcite of a tev galactic signal , possibly of diffuse origin , invites us to place the gev emission in a larger context . in this paper , we show that tev and pev gamma - ray observations provide a long `` lever arm '' on the gev excess and its origin .",
    "in particular , the combined gev ",
    "pev observations shed new light on emission due to hadronic cosmic - ray interactions .",
    "these hadronic gamma - rays must exist at some level , and appear with a characteristic spectrum fixed by pion decay and the primary cosmic - ray spectrum .",
    "since the `` pion bump '' at @xmath122 is not seen , the evidence for pionic emission must come from the high - energy tail , which should dominate over any leptonic ( i.e. , inverse compton ) signal at high energies ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "for this reason , tev ",
    "pev data offer key new constraints on pionic gamma - rays , which can allow us to determine the hadronic gamma component and thus isolate the residual contribution(s ) .",
    "can we arrive at a consistent picture of high - energy galactic gamma - ray emission ?",
    "yes , though present data are insufficient to single out a unique combination of sources .",
    "however , some conclusions are already clear : ( a ) the simplest picture , in which pions are created from cosmic - rays with energy spectra as measured locally , is _ inconsistent _ with published egret and milagro data .",
    "( b ) besides the `` gev excess '' identified by egret , a `` tev excess '' is likely to be present as well .",
    "we have shown that one of the main uncertainties in accounting for the @xcite diffuse tev gamma - ray observation comes from unresolved sources .",
    "( c ) as we have pointed out , indications of a possible break in spectra of some point sources can have important consequences for cosmic - ray acceleration .",
    "( d ) the true picture of galactic gamma - rays , which might follow several scenarios , can be revealed with further observations .    1 .",
    "one possibility is that the tev excess is indeed is truly diffuse and due to pionic emission @xcite . in the simplest picture",
    ", this would be a scenario where no break in the diffuse gamma - ray spectrum is observed between the gev and tev regimes .",
    "this would in turn require a spectral index @xmath124 , as pointed out by the milagro collaboration , which would indicate that measured local cosmic - ray spectrum is different from , and harder than , the galactic average .",
    "this would also mean that the pionic component is very close to maximal , if not larger , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] . in this case",
    ", the spectrum should follow the same power law out to the pev region .",
    "this pev signal would lie just below the current limits , awaiting discovery ( or falsification ! ) with modest improvements in sensitivity .",
    "+ such a hard pionic spectrum would greatly reduce the gev excess , lessening the motivation for a large inverse compton or dark matter component . for a more realistic pionic spectrum ,",
    "there is the well - known problem of the gev excess .",
    "we are noting here that models which explain the gev excess with a low pionic normalization and new component at gev energies must now be confronted with the tev excess that they create",
    "another possibility is that the tev excess is truly diffuse , but not due to interstellar pionic emission .",
    "this would be the case if there is a `` hard electron component , '' i.e. , with a spectrum not observed locally ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such an anomalous component could create an inverse compton signal which composes the gev excess , but also extends to tev energies where it dominates over the pionic component .",
    "this scenario would result in a gamma - ray spectral break at a few tens of gev .",
    "having a definite handle on the inverse compton component would in turn determine the pionic gamma - ray component .",
    "moreover , because the hard electron spectrum model explains a large fraction of the gev excess , it thus excludes dark matter explanation .",
    "however , if the tev excess can not be explained with the inverse compton component , then this would indicate a more exotic solution .",
    "3 .   just as the gev excess raises the exciting prospect of a dark matter signal @xcite , so too does the tev excess .",
    "this scenario is testable .",
    "if the tev excess is due to annihilations , one expects a strict cutoff above the mass of the dark matter particle ( which necessarily must be rather heavy , @xmath125 tev ) ; this should appear as a break or perhaps even a peak in the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "also , the evidence for the tev excess comes from the milagro region which lies @xmath126 from the galactic center , and thus probes rather peripheral galactocentric radii @xmath127 kpc .",
    "given that dark matter densities ( and the resulting annihilation rate @xmath128 ) are expected to peak at the center , one would expect a rapid increase in the diffuse signal as one scans from the milagro region to the galactic center . and",
    "a dark matter interpretation of either or both gamma - ray signals faces similar challenges from other high - energy particle observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "4 .   finally",
    ", the tev excess could result from unresolved isolated sources such as supernova remnants .",
    "this scenario could easily be checked by surveying for tev point sources in the galactic region observed by milagro .",
    "indeed , the egret sources in the milagro region appear as `` hot spots '' on the milagro map , though it is unclear how significant this may be .",
    "also , another observation of the diffuse galactic plane tev gamma - rays could yield a flux that does not require a tev excess , but is instead consistent with a diffuse pionic emission with a more conventional spectral index .",
    "thus it is crucial that veritas tev telescope surveys the egret sources , especially the ones in the region observed by milagro .",
    "a measurement of the diffuse galactic plane tev gamma - ray flux with better resolution telescopes like veritas and hess would not only confirm the milagro detection , but also would provide much sharper angular resolution of the signal .",
    "these additional data could significantly tighten the constraints based on gamma - ray spectra , and open up the possibility of distinguishing the diffuse tev sources based on the sky distribution .",
    "thus , existing diffuse gamma - ray observations of the galactic plane are consistent with an energy spectrum that is at once empirically simple ( a broken power law ) yet stubbornly resistant to theoretical explanation .",
    "fortunately , upcoming observations across the gev - tev - pev range will add qualitative and quantitative detail that will distinguish among and/or exclude the possible sources of the highest energy photons in our galaxy .",
