    "variability is one of the defining properties of blazars , characterized by variations of their flux even of two orders of magnitude in time scales of years , and smaller changes , but still up to factor 2 , in hours / days time scales .",
    "light curves as seen , e.g. , in the x  rays and in the optical , often show a quasi  symmetric behavior , with rise and decay time scales approximately equal ( see i.e. urry et al .",
    "1997 , ghisellini et al .",
    "1997 , massaro et al . 1996 ,",
    "giommi et al . 1998 ) , indicating that both times are connected to the light travel time across the source @xmath0 , and therefore suggesting that the cooling times of the emitting electrons are shorter .",
    "furthermore this implies that the emitting electron distribution is significantly changing on time scales shorter than @xmath0 , at least at these energies . in order to reproduce the observed variability pattern we need to study the time evolution of the emitting particles distribution _ and _ to take into account the different light travel times of photons produced in different regions of the source .",
    "the observed flux is then , at any time , _ the sum of the emission produced by particle distributions of different ages _ , each one produced in a different region of the source : even a homogeneous source then resembles an inhomogeneous one . in ",
    "2 we shortly present the model assumptions , in  3 we show some results of the simulations in the case of electron distributions homogeneously injected throughout the source and in a more realistic case of a shock traveling down a region of a jet . in ",
    "4 we apply our model to the specific case of mkn 421 .",
    "we assume that the emission is produced by a distribution of relativistic electrons injected in a region of typical dimension @xmath1 embedded in a tangled magnetic field @xmath2 , at a rate @xmath3 [ @xmath4 s@xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the electrons lorentz factor ) .",
    "electrons lose energy by emitting synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton radiation ( ssc ) .",
    "escape from the source is also considered ( @xmath7 is assumed being independent of energy ) . the continuity equation governing",
    "the temporal evolution of the electron distribution @xmath8 [ @xmath4 ] is @xmath10 + q(\\gamma , t ) -   \\frac{n(\\gamma , t)}{t_{esc } } \\label{cont}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the total cooling rate ( synchrotron and synchrotron self  compton ) .",
    "we calculate ssc spectra produced by the calculated electrons distribution at any given time .",
    "the details of the numerical method used to solve the equation are illustrated in chiaberge & ghisellini ( 1998 ) .",
    "if the particle distribution evolves more rapidly than @xmath0 _ the observer will see , at any time , a convolution of different spectra , each produced in a different part of the source_. initially the observer only sees the emission coming from fresh electrons located in the region ( ` slice ' ) closest to her / him ; then the inner parts of the source become visible , also showing ` young ' spectra , while electrons in the front slices are evolving . after a time @xmath0 all the emitting region will be visible : the back of it with fresh electrons and the front of it with older electrons . in order to take into account this effect",
    ", we divide the source of size @xmath1 into @xmath12 slices of equal thickness @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the shorter among cooling , injection and escape times ) . in this way",
    ", each single slice can be considered as an homogeneous emitting region .",
    "we then sum the contribution of each slice at any time .",
    "we consider slices having equal volumes ( assuming a ` cubic ' geometry ) , with the line of sight placed at 90@xmath15 with respect to one face of the cube .",
    "this angle , in the lab frame , transforms to a viewing angle of @xmath16 , if the source moves with a lorentz factor @xmath17 , which is appropriate for blazars .",
    "extension to different geometries ( i.e. cylinder , sphere , etc ) is trivial , by properly weighting each slice volume and does not affect the results . even in the simplest ` cubic ' case time - lags among light curves at different frequencies",
    "are observable .",
    "we summarize here the results of the simulations of two different illustrative injection phases : i ) narrow gaussian electron distribution centered at @xmath18 lasting for a time @xmath19 ; ii ) power law electron distribution ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) between @xmath22 and @xmath23 , lasting for a time @xmath24 .",
    "the source physical parameters are : @xmath25 cm , @xmath26 gauss , injected luminosity @xmath27 erg s@xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "we stress that our main purpose is to reproduce the quasi ",
    "symmetric light curves often observed at optical  x rays frequencies , in order to put strict constraints on the physical parameters of a source producing such a variability pattern .",
    "the main difference between injecting a gaussian distribution of electrons and injecting a power  law ( with @xmath30 ) is that in the first case the emission will be concentrated first at high frequencies , and only after some @xmath31 electrons can substantially emit at lower frequencies .",
    "this produces a time delay between the peaks of the emission at different frequencies in case ( i ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . also notice the different behavior of the light curves at different frequencies , showing plateau at the highest corresponding electron energies . in case ( ii ) at frequencies where @xmath32 both the rise and the decay are controlled by the light crossing time , and we have symmetric light curves with time lags depending on the different cooling times .",
    "+ according to our results , quasi symmetric light curves can be only originated in two cases : 1 ) @xmath33 ; 2 ) @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in case ( 1 ) symmetric light curves are present only within a very small range of frequencies ( @xmath36 ) , while in case ( 2 ) quasi  symmetric light curves can occur at all frequencies corresponding to particle cooling time scales shorter than @xmath0 . furthermore the second case can be interpreted as a result of a shock lasting for a time @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , we reproduced the case of a shock of longitudinal dimension @xmath1 and width @xmath37 running along a region of the jet of same dimension @xmath1 ( perpendicular to the jet axis ) .",
    "as in the previous cases , we assume that the observer is located at an angle @xmath38 from the jet axis , such that the viewing angle in the comoving frame is @xmath39 .",
    "we calculate the observed light curves in the comoving frame , by summing the contributions of each part of the source , taking into account both the traveling of the shock across the source ( accelerating particles in different regions at different times , as the shock travels across the source ) and the light travel time effect .",
    "details are presented in chiaberge & ghisellini ( 1998 ) .",
    "the light curves obtained in this shock case are similar to the corresponding ` homogeneous ' case ( @xmath24 ) , with slightly longer time  lags ( see fig .",
    "in may 1994 the asca satellite revealed an x  ray flare of the nearby ( @xmath40 ) bl lac object ( takahashi et al .",
    "1996 ) during an high state of tev emission ( macomb et al .",
    "observations report an increase of a factor @xmath41 of the 210 kev flux , with a doubling time scale of @xmath42 hours .",
    "much less amplitude variability is present in the ir , optical , uv and gev bands .",
    "takahashi et al . (",
    "1996 ) found a time - lag between hard x ",
    "rays ( @xmath43 kev ) and soft x  rays ( @xmath44 kev ) of @xmath45 hour : the hard x ",
    "rays lead the soft x  rays .",
    "they interpret this as due to synchrotron cooling .",
    "we can qualitatively reproduce this behavior , assuming that the rapid variability is due to the sum of a rapidly evolving component and a quasi - constant one , corresponding to the high state fit of the spectral energy distribution ( chiaberge & ghisellini , 1998 ) .",
    "we take into account the effects of beaming using the following transformations : if @xmath17 is the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath46 the viewing angle and @xmath47^{-1}$ ] the beaming factor , the observed intensity is @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the comoving intensity and comoving time scales , respectively .",
    "we found the following parameters for the variable component : @xmath52 cm , @xmath53 gauss , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 between @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we perform the simulation in the shock case with @xmath59 ( width of the shock ) , @xmath60 ( time during which the shock is active ) and @xmath61 ( velocity of the shock in the comoving frame ) .",
    "light curves and x  ray spectral index variability are reported in fig [ fig2 ] ."
