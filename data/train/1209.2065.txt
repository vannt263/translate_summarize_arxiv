    "with the power of large number statistics , wide - area astronomical surveys in this decade have made many significant discoveries . a new generation of high - precision , wide - area optical imaging surveys are being proposed for the end of this decade to address fundamental questions in cosmology , galaxy formation and to search for extrasolar planets .",
    "most recently , the advent of the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has provided the community with an unprecedented dataset in the mid - infrared .",
    "this unique nasa mission mapped the entire sky in four bands at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22@xmath0 m ( @xmath1 through @xmath2 ) , with 5@xmath9 point source sensitivities better than 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.75 and 6 mjy , respectively . _",

    "_ wise _ has made two public data releases , including coadded atlas images and source catalogs .",
    "the first was the preliminary release in april 2011 , covering roughly half of the sky , and the second was the all - sky data release in march 2012 , covering the entire sky .",
    "although _ wise _ has a significantly smaller aperture and the angular resolution is only half that of _ spitzer _ , its unique all - sky coverage enables selection of large samples of extragalactic sources , allowing statistical studies of stellar photospheric emission at 3.4 and 4.6@xmath0 m  and dust emission at 12 and 22@xmath0 m .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to provide an empirical characterization of _ wise _ extragalactic sources , and to identify the types of sources which can be isolated using mid - infrared colors . to achieve this goal",
    ", we combine _ wise _ mid - infrared data with optical data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) seventh data release ( dr7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we characterize the color distributions and source types using broad - band photometry and spectroscopic information .",
    "the motivation for such a phenomenological study is to give the community a summary of the observational properties and the limitations of two large surveys , particularly for mid - infrared extragalactic objects .",
    "more detailed , quantitative analyses of specific extragalactic populations are discussed in companion papers by the _ wise _ extragalactic science team .",
    "specifically , @xcite and @xcite discuss _ wise _ selection of low - metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies at @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite examines the origin of 12@xmath0 m  emission in mid - infrared galaxies at @xmath27 using _ wise _ data in conjunction with sdss dr7 spectroscopic data , while @xcite uses keck spectroscopy to study the redshift distribution of flux - limited _ wise _ samples . @xcite and @xcite present detailed studies of _ wise_-selected agn within the cosmos and botes fields , respectively , including careful analyses of completeness and reliability of _ wise _ agn selection using @xmath28 color .",

    "we identify the characteristic color criteria which can be used to select large samples of strong agn / qsos (   3.2 ) , type-2 agn candidates (   3.3 ) and potential @xmath19 ulirgs (   3.4 ) .",
    "section  [ sec - discuss ] summarizes the main conclusions and discusses the implications for future studies using _ wise_. throughout the paper , we adopt an @xmath32=0.27 , @xmath33=0.73  and @xmath34=71cosmology .",
    "the data used by this paper are drawn from the overlapping sky region where both _",
    "wise _ preliminary public release data and sdss dr7 data are available .",
    "although this area is only 1/4th of the total sdss area , the number of galaxies included in our analysis is @xmath35 , large enough for the purposes of this paper .",
    "because this paper started with the preliminary release data , we kept the same overlap region between the preliminary release data and sdss dr7 , but the actual _ wise _  photometry are taken from the all - sky data release .",
    "figure  [ wcover ] presents the full - sky coverage map from _ wise _ , with colors indicating the number of repeated single exposures at each sky position .",
    "overlaid in the figure are the coverages of the sdss dr7 data and the _ wise _ preliminary release data .",
    "the overlap area between dr7 and the _ wise _ preliminary release is 2344 deg@xmath16 and defines the area analyzed in the rest of this paper .",
    "this area is slightly less than 30%of the total sdss areal coverage , and is 5.7%  of the entire sky .    one characteristic feature of the _ wise _ mission is that it does not have uniform depth - of - coverage . for both the preliminary and the all - sky data release , the median",
    "depth - of - coverage is 15.65 , 15.55 , 14.85 and 14.84 exposures at @xmath36 and @xmath2 respectively ( each single exposure has 11seconds ) .",
    "95%  of the sky has coverage @xmath37 at @xmath1 , and @xmath38 at @xmath2 . taking 10 exposures per position as the depth - of - coverage in @xmath1 and @xmath39 , and 9 in @xmath40 and @xmath2 , the @xmath41 sensitivities are 17.30mag ( 0.037mjy ) , 15.84mag ( 0.079mjy ) , 11.59mag ( 0.67mjy ) and 8.00mag ( 5.10mjy ) for the four bands , respectively .",
    "we start with the _ wise _ preliminary public release source catalog @xcite .",
    "this catalog includes all sources detected in at least one band with photometric signal - to - noise ratio ( snr)@xmath42 after removing all artifacts .",
    "as described in the explanatory supplement to the preliminary data release products , source detection and photometric measurements are performed on all four bands simultaneously .",
    "the released catalog contains photometric measurements ( or limits ) in all four bands .",
    "_ wise _ is the most sensitive at 3.4@xmath0 m and the least sensitive at 22@xmath0 m ; the minimum @xmath41 sensitivities for these two bands are 0.05 and 6mjy , respectively . for @xmath43@xmath44@xmath45 , the sensitivity ratio @xmath46^\\alpha = 0.0083 $ ] corresponds to a mid - infrared spectral index @xmath47 . among all",
    "_ wise _ @xmath1-detected galaxies at the limiting depth of that band , only 2%  of the sources are also detected in @xmath2 , implying extremely red mid - infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , redder than @xmath48 .",
    "the public released catalog contains a very small number of sources which are detected only in @xmath40 and/or @xmath2 , but not in @xmath1 and/or @xmath39 @xcite . due to the large sensitivity differences between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the entire catalog is essentially a 3.4@xmath0m - selected sample with snr@xmath497 ( @xmath50 ) ; only 0.16%  of the catalog is very faint in @xmath1 but bright in one of the other three _ wise _ bands ( snr@xmath51 , but snr@xmath87 for any of the other three bands ) .",
    "therefore , we call this original catalog from the _ wise _ data archive , without any additional cuts , the w1 sample .",
    "many sources in this preliminary public release catalog have snr@xmath52 , but low snr in the other three _ wise _ bands .",
    "when we study the color distributions , it becomes necessary to require the color errors to be small relative to the range of colors .",
    "specifically , the @xmath53 color for _ wise _ galaxies roughly spans the narrow range , 0 to 2 .",
    "we require the errors in @xmath28 to be less than 0.27 mag , meaning we need a source catalog with snr@xmath54 ( corresponding to @xmath55 mag ) .",
    "a similar argument is applied to the @xmath56 colors , which have a larger spread of @xmath57 . in this case",
    ", we require snr@xmath58 ( @xmath59 mag ) . in summary , to obtain meaningful color distributions , we base our analyses below on the following three source samples : the original w1 sample ( snr@xmath60 ) , a w1/2 sample ( snr@xmath60 and snr@xmath61 ) , and a w1/2/3 sample ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "figure  [ bars ] shows the source fraction in each of the above three samples relative to the four - band merged , public released catalog .",
    "when applying additional photometric snr cuts , the source sample sizes become increasingly smaller . at snr@xmath495 , 4.6@xmath0msources are only 57%  of the w1 sample . at snr@xmath493 , this fraction is only 15%  and 2%  at 12@xmath0 m  and 22@xmath0 m , respectively . in the sense of source surface density , the w1 sample has @xmath638230 sources per deg@xmath16 , whereas the w1/2 and w1/2/3 samples have only 4700 and 1235 sources per deg@xmath16 , respectively . for comparison ,",
    "the source surface density in the sdss photometric catalog is about 27,300 sources per deg@xmath16 , over three times higher than that of _ wise _",
    "3.4@xmath0 m .",
    "this is because sdss detects many more low - luminosity ( low - mass ) galaxies than _ wise _ ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "for the three samples specifically selected for this paper , snr@xmath7=7 corresponds to apparent magnitudes between 16.8 and 17.6mag ( 0.058 - 0.028mjy ) , snr@xmath64=5 to 15.9mag to 16.5mag ( 0.075 - 0.043mjy ) , and snr@xmath65=3 to the limiting magnitudes of 12.2 to 12.8mag ( 0.38 - 0.22mjy ) .",
    "_ wise _ photometry is calibrated relative to measurements of standard stars , using the vega magnitude system .",
    "the conversion factors to the ab system ( @xmath66 ) are 2.683 ( @xmath1 ) , 3.319 ( @xmath39 ) , 5.242 ( @xmath40 ) and 6.604 ( @xmath2 ) ; equivalently , zero magnitude corresponds to 309.5 , 171.79 , 31.676 and 8.36jy for the four bands , respectively @xcite and @xcite .",
    "sdss photometry directly output from the sdss archive is in the asinh magnitude system .",
    "we translate asinh magnitudes into the ab system using information provided by sdss .",
    "when calculating sdss@xmath67_wise _ colors , we convert sdss photometry to the vega system using @xmath68 @xcite . throughout this paper , _",
    "wise _ magnitudes are in the vega system , sdss magnitudes are in the ab system , but all colors are in the vega system .",
    "this paper uses the sdss dr7 data @xcite , including the photometric catalog , the main galaxy spectroscopic catalog @xcite , the luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) spectroscopic sample @xcite and the qso sample @xcite .",
    "the dr7 legacy survey catalog covers 8423 deg@xmath16 and contains 230 million sources .",
    "the main galaxy spectroscopic catalog is generated jointly by the max - planck - institut fur astrophysik and the johns hopkins university ( mpa - jhu dr7 main galaxy catalog ; brinchmann et al .",
    "it consists of almost @xmath69 galaxies with @xcite magnitudes brighter than @xmath70 for which various derived physical parameters are readily available .",
    "we adopt the following classification criteria as in kauffman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) : star - forming ( sf ) galaxies are defined as having @xmath71 < $ ] 1.3 + 0.61 @xmath72 $ ] ( eq .  1 in * ? ? ?",

    "* ) ; and composite systems are defined as having @xmath73/{\\rm h}\\beta)$ ] between the two values described by the above equations .",
    "these sf galaxy and agn definitions are used in   [ sec - colors ] when we utilize sdss spectra to classify _ wise _  sources .",
    "when based on _ wise _  data alone , we do not use these definitions .",
    "two lrg samples are selected in color - magnitude space , one to @xmath74 ( roughly volume - limited , to @xmath75 ) and one to @xmath76 ( flux - limited , to @xmath77 ) @xcite .",
    "the qso sample is selected by their non - stellar colors or first @xcite radio emission to @xmath78 for @xmath79 and to @xmath80 for @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "in addition , all sdss photometric redshifts ( when spectroscopic redshifts are not available ) used in sections below are the ones derived based on the neural network method @xcite .",
    "we caution that , in general , broad band photometric redshifts are highly uncertain for strong type-1 agns / qsos @xcite .",
    "these strong type-1 agns from sdss have the most complete spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the _ wise _ 3.4 and 4.6@xmath0 m  bands primarily sample emission from stellar photospheres , whereas the 12 and 22@xmath0 m  bands are more sensitive to dust emission heated by stars and accreting black holes .",
    "therefore , _ wise _ readily identifies a variety of galaxy populations in the mid - infrared sky . to characterize these populations , we first address several basic properties of the matched _",
    "wise_-sdss catalog , including optical brightness distributions , redshifts , the fraction of _ wise _ sources undetected or with very faint optical counterparts , and optical thru mid - infrared colors of matched sources .",
    "we carried out source matching between _ wise _ and sdss dr7 with a matching radius of 3 .",
    "this is based on the fact that the _ wise _ angular resolutions are 61 , 64 , 65 , and 12 for the four bands , respectively .",
    "figure  [ match ] shows the percentage of _ wise _ sources with sdss @xmath4-band optical counterparts for the four _ wise _ bands . to a depth of @xmath82 ,",
    "corresponding to the 50%  completeness depth of sdss @xcite , 91%  of the w1/2/3 and 96%  of the w1/2/3/4 ( snr@xmath83 ) samples have optical counterparts .",
    "in contrast , only 72%  and 86%  of the w1 and the w1/2 samples have optical counterparts with @xmath84 .",
    "this implies that the bulk of 12 and 22@xmath0 m  galaxies are dusty star - forming galaxies and agns at low redshifts ( @xmath85 ) , whereas 15 - 25%  of 3.4 and 4.6@xmath0 m  sources could be massive early - type galaxies which are fainter than the sdss photometric limits and are at @xmath86@xmath491 .",
    "indeed , @xcite reports on a _ wise_-selected galaxy cluster at @xmath87 which is well - detected in @xmath1 and @xmath39 but is undetected by sdss .",
    "figure  [ rzhistogram ] shows the optical brightness and photometric redshift distributions for the mid - infrared sources detected in the four bands .",
    "it is clear that _ wise _",
    "22@xmath0 m  sources have corresponding optical magnitudes which peak at @xmath8819 , one magnitude brighter than the peaks for the w1 , w2 and w3 samples . for comparison ,",
    "the parent sdss photometric catalog continues to rise until completeness causes an apparent drop at @xmath89 .",
    "this confirms that sdss detects many more low - mass , low - luminosity galaxies than _ wise _ and the bulk of _ wise _ galaxies with optical counterparts are relatively local , at @xmath90 .",
    "about 28%  and 14%  of _ wise _",
    "3.4@xmath0 m  and 4.6@xmath0 m  sources are very faint or without any optical counterparts in the sdss photometric catalog .",
    "these optically faint 3.4@xmath0 m  galaxies are predominantly massive early - type galaxies at @xmath3 , though heavily obscured galaxies and agn also contribute at some level .",
    "figure  [ w12histogram ] examines the @xmath28 colors of this optically faint population , showing that @xmath1 sources with very faint @xmath4-band magnitudes ( @xmath91 ) have redder @xmath28 colors than optically brighter @xmath1 sources .",
    "as discussed below and shown with color - redshift tracks for galaxy templates from @xcite , redder @xmath28 color is an indicator of early - type and star - forming galaxies being at higher redshifts , @xmath3 .",
    "what types of galaxies are detected by _",
    "wise _ at 3.4 and 22 microns ?",
    "one way to answer this is to calculate expected _ wise _ magnitudes as a function of redshift using empirical galaxy templates .",
    "figure  [ magz ] shows the expected @xmath1 and @xmath39 magnitudes for an early - type galaxy template , as well as @xmath40 and @xmath2 magnitudes for an infrared - bright galaxy ( iras  19254@xmath677245 ) as a function of redshift .",
    "this figure suggests that ignoring evolution , l@xmath92 early - type galaxies should be visible in _ wise _",
    "3.4@xmath0 m  data out to redshifts of 1.5 - 2 .",
    "another important result emphasized by figure  [ magz ] is that the observed @xmath1 magnitudes do not change significantly over @xmath93 for early - type galaxies ; this benevolent @xmath94-correction has been noted repeatedly for the similar 3.6@xmath0 m  band of _ spitzer _  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , optical @xmath4-band magnitudes steeply decline in brightness with redshift .",
    "figure  [ faintr1 ] illustrates how @xmath1 and @xmath2 magnitudes change with optical brightness , @xmath4 , and photometric redshift .",
    "@xmath1 traces @xmath4 until @xmath95 , at which point @xmath1 magnitudes remain within a narrow range of 15.8 - 16.8mag , while optical brightness becomes increasingly fainter , stretching over three magnitudes .",
    "figure  [ magz ] and figure  [ faintr1 ] illustrate the same effect , most galaxy seds have very steep slopes at ultraviolet through optical wavelengths , and much shallower slopes in the near - infrared .",
    "the turn - over at @xmath96 in figure  [ faintr1 ] implies that the bulk of @xmath1 sources are low - redshift ( @xmath97 ) , typical sdss - detected galaxies , and @xmath1 sources with @xmath98 tend to be at higher redshifts ( @xmath99 ) .      with four - band mid - infrared photometry , can _ wise _ colors alone provide diagnostics for different types of sources as well as crude redshift information ?",
    "figure  [ wcc ] addresses this question by showing @xmath28 vs. @xmath56 colors for the w1/2/3 sample .",
    "the three high source density regions are : _ ( 1 ) _ the stellar locus with both colors near zero ; at mid - infrared wavelengths , emission from galactic stars from spectral class o through @xmath63  t3 is dominated by the rayleigh - jeans tail of the blackbody spectrum , thereby yielding vega - system colors near zero for most galactic stars ( note that pure elliptical galaxies with no dust at @xmath101 also sit near the stellar locus ) ; _ ( 2 ) _ the red @xmath28 cloud with @xmath13 ; and _ ( 3 ) _ the bluer @xmath28 sequence , spanning a wide range in @xmath56 color . here",
    "we do not see any extremely cool brown dwarfs with very red @xmath28 color due to methane absorption since such sources are very faint in @xmath40 , and thus are excluded in our w1/2/3 sample @xcite .    what is the physical basis of the color - color distribution shown in figure  [ wcc ] ?",
    "figure  [ template ] through [ wcc2 ] examine this question from different angles .",
    "figure  [ template ] shows empirical galaxy and agn templates from @xmath102@xmath0 m  based on @xmath103 objects with multi - wavelength data in noao deep wide - field survey @xcite . for systems with strong nuclear heating ,",
    "the mid - infrared seds tend to be roughly a rising power - law , resulting in @xmath13 . for systems with dominant stellar emission at @xmath104 ,",
    "this color is smaller because the 3.4@xmath0 m  band is sampling below the 1.6@xmath0 m h@xmath105 opacity peak of the stellar emission , making the @xmath53 color bluer ; at @xmath106 , the 3.4@xmath0 m  band samples below the near - infrared stellar peak , getting fainter , thereby providing redder @xmath28 colors .",

    "the model colors clearly do not span the full range of observed values in figure  [ wcc ] .",
    "the assumed sed templates , generated from optical and _ spitzer _ observations , are by no means complete .",

    "this naturally leads to two questions : _ ( 1 ) _ can _ wise _ colors be used to identify type-2 agns ; and _ ( 2 ) _ what is the relative fraction of type-1 and type-2 qso / agns selected by _ wise _ ?",
    "one simple way to understand the _ wise _  colors of extragalactic sources is to compare mid - ir colors of sdss unresolved , point sources ( including qsos , stars and compact galaxies ) with that of extended galaxies ( including type-2 agns and normal galaxies ) .",

    "wise _ colors of unresolved sources ( galactic stars and quasars ) are clearly separated from extended galaxies .",
    "furthermore , in terms of unresolved sdss sources , note that the galactic stars ( at the origin ) are clearly distinct from the unresolved quasars ( with redder mid - infrared colors ) .",
    "one cautionary note about type-2 agn is that any discussion and conclusions will depend how such sources are defined . in the current analysis , we define two type-2 agn samples .",
    "the first sample is the agn candidates with @xmath13 , @xmath133 , and with extended sdss @xmath4-band morphologies ( sdss type = 3 ; @xmath122 ) . in general , agns have two components , extended galaxy and central accreting black holes . for strong agns ,",

    ", we estimate @xmath136 of @xmath122 _ wise_-selected agn / qsos to be spatially resolved .",

    "figure  [ qso12 ] examines this technique , showing @xmath137 colors for both type-1 and optically bright type-2 agns with extended sdss morphologies .",
    "the morphological criterion imposes a strong selection function , producing an artificial deficit of luminous type-2 agn in figure  [ qso12 ] .",
    "higher luminosity sources will tend to be at higher redshifts and high - redshift obscured agns drop below the @xmath138 limit imposed to provide reliable morphologies . here",
    "@xmath139 is calculated using spectroscopic or photometric redshifts , including small @xmath94-corrections ( less than 0.1  magnitude ) based on the appropriate type-1 or type-2 agn template from @xcite .",
    "type-1 and type-2 agns clearly have very different @xmath137 color distributions , especially at the high luminosity end . this is consistent with what has been found by @xcite based on x - ray and _ spitzer _ data in the botes field .",
    "this result lends support for using @xmath140 to select type-2 agns which do not have reliable optical morphology information .",
    "furthermore , the feasibility of this method is illustrated in figure  [ faintr2 ] , showing the calculated optical / mid - ir colors based on assumed sets of sed templates as a function of redshift .",

    "the surface density of such a type-2 agn candidates is about 16.4 per deg@xmath16 , whereas @xmath145 bright with resolved morphology , type-2 agn is about 31%  of all agns , yielding surface density of 17.3 per deg@xmath16 . @xcite , using the _ hubble space telescope _ imaging available in the cosmos field , find that @xmath146 of _ wise_-selected agn candidates to a depth of @xmath147 are unresolved in @xmath148 .",
    "our intention here is to illustrate the methods of using colors to select large samples of type-2 agn candidates over wide areas of sky .",
    "our crude estimate of the type-2 agn fraction ( integrated ) is on the order of 1/3rd of all agns .",
    "however , we caution that to truly understand the implications of these numbers , we will need to have the redshift and luminosity information .",

    "one of the primary _ wise _ mission goals is to identify extremely luminous ( @xmath149 ) dusty starbursts and agns ( ulirgs and hyper - luminous infrared galaxies , or hylirgs ) at high redshift .",
    "we have pursued two basic approaches in finding high - redshift ulirgs .",
    "one is to use _ wise _  data alone , and the second is to combine _ wise _  with optical data .    using _ wise _ colors alone",
    ", high - redshift ulirgs can be identified by requiring very red , rising mid - infrared seds , redder than the spectral index @xmath29 @xmath150 corresponding to the _ wise_sensitivity limits ( see   [ sec - wisedata ] ) .",
    "specifically , this means significant detections ( snr@xmath83 - 5 ) in @xmath40 or @xmath2 , but no detections in @xmath1 and @xmath39 , so - called @xmath151-dropouts @xcite .",
    "follow - up optical spectroscopy of more than 100 candidates using the keck , gemini , magellan , and palomar telescopes have demonstrated that the majority of these candidates are indeed at redshifts of 1 - 3 , implying very high luminosities given the high fluxes at 12 and 22@xmath0 m @xcite .",

    "the second method is to utilize optical / mid - infrared colors .",
    "as shown in figure  [ faintr2 ] , @xmath153 color becomes redder at higher redshift .",
    "this is true as well for the other three _ wise _ bands .",
    "indeed , there is a rich literature using red optical - to - mid - infrared colors with _",
