    "we begin by presenting definitions and theorems about divisors on @xmath0 , the compactification of the moduli space of genus 0 @xmath2-pointed curves over @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a smooth manifold , and let @xmath5 be the group formally generated by weil divisors on @xmath4 .",
    "the picard group , @xmath6 , is the quotient of @xmath5 by the principal divisors .",
    "we have the following characterization / definition of the picard group of weil divisors on @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite the picard group , @xmath1 , is isomorphic to the quotient @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes numerical equivalence of divisors .",
    "@xmath0 denotes the deligne - mumford compactification of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the points of @xmath9 are riemann spheres with @xmath2 marked points modulo isomorphism .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the alphabet used to index the set of marked points , @xmath11 , on @xmath9 .",
    "the boundary divisor , @xmath12 , parametrizes stable curves of type ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the stable curves are curves which are nodal riemann surfaces of genus zero such that each component has at least three marked or singular points . in this article",
    "we will use the term boundary divisor to refer to the irreducible components of @xmath14 .",
    "the ( irreducible ) boundary divisors can be combinatorially enumerated by specifying a partition of @xmath15 into two subsets , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with @xmath18 in the following way .",
    "any simple closed loop on a sphere with @xmath2 marked points partitions the points of @xmath19 ( indexed by @xmath15 ) into two subsets as in the left hand side of figure [ pinch ] . pinching this loop to a point yields a nodal topological surface as in the right hand side of figure [ pinch ] .",
    "the stable curves of this type are obtained by putting all possible complex structures on this topological surface .",
    "a single boundary component parametrizes these stable curves for a given pinched loop .",
    "we denote by @xmath20 the boundary divisor in which the loop pinches the subset indexed by @xmath21 , hence @xmath22 .",
    "we denote the set of ( irreducible ) boundary divisors on @xmath0 by @xmath23 .",
    "this set has cardinality @xmath24 .",
    "the set of boundary divisors , @xmath25 , on @xmath26 contains the three divisors , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the set of boundary divisors , @xmath29 , on @xmath30 contains the 10 divisors , @xmath20 , where @xmath31 has cardinality 2 .",
    "we now introduce the geometric notation for a boundary divisor which will be useful in the proofs in this paper .",
    "we will frequently refer to cyclic orderings , denoted @xmath32 , on the set @xmath15 .",
    "one may think of a cyclic ordering as an @xmath2-sided , oriented polygon , whose vertices are labeled by the elements of @xmath15 such that @xmath33 follows @xmath34 in the clockwise direction , and hence @xmath35 .",
    "we denote by @xmath36 the @xmath2-sided , oriented polygon whose cyclic ordering is @xmath37 and call this the standard ordering .",
    "[ divnot ] to obtain a geometric representation of the boundary divisor @xmath20 associated to @xmath38 , we partition @xmath16 into subsets , @xmath39 , of indices which are adjacent on the polygon @xmath36 , with the condition that there is a unique minimal @xmath40 . in other words , there is no union of two sets , @xmath41 and @xmath42 that form an adjacent block on @xmath36 .",
    "then , the set @xmath43 inherits a cyclic ordering from @xmath36 . without loss of generality",
    ", we may assume that this cyclic ordering corresponds to the subscripts on the @xmath44 and that the number 1 is an element both of @xmath45 and of @xmath16 .",
    "given these conditions , we have that for each @xmath44 there exists a gap , @xmath46 , of adjacent indices on @xmath36 which are not in @xmath16 and which are exactly the indices between @xmath44 and @xmath47 on @xmath36",
    ". then we denote the divisor @xmath20 by the @xmath48-sided polygon whose vertices are cyclically labeled by @xmath49 . in the case",
    "where @xmath50 , we draw the divisor polygon as circle with two points , @xmath45 and @xmath51 .    for @xmath52",
    "two divisors are represented in figure 2 .",
    "the divisor @xmath53 is represented by a hexagon and the divisor @xmath54 is represented by a two - pointed circle",
    ".    @xcite[kepres ] a presentation of the picard group , @xmath1 , is given by taking the classes , @xmath55 of the boundary divisors , @xmath56 as generators , subject to the following relations : for any four distinct elements , @xmath57 in @xmath15 , @xmath58    the following proposition due to a. gibney @xcite specifies a basis for @xmath1 and also yields an expression for its dimension .",
    "[ keel ] let @xmath59 denote any cyclic ordering .",
    "then a basis for @xmath1 is given by the divisors defined by nonempty subsets of marked points on the @xmath2-gon which do not form an adjacent set of vertices on the @xmath2-gon .",
    "we call this set of divisors the * non - adjacent basis * for the cyclic ordering @xmath60 .    in the notation [ divnot ]",
    ", this proposition means that the set of divisors @xmath61 is a basis for @xmath1 .",
    "therefore the main purpose of this paper is to find an expression for the divisors denoted @xmath62 .",
    "* remarks*. the following combinatorial formula for the dimension follows immediately from counting the elements of a non - adjacent basis : @xmath63 this dimension was calculated by s. keel in @xcite as the dimension of the first chow group of @xmath0 .",
    "consider the standard ordering , @xmath64 .",
    "then the non - adjacent basis for @xmath65 for this ordering is given by the five divisor classes @xmath66    ( of proposition [ keel ] ) .",
    "without loss of generality , we prove this proposition for the standard cyclic ordering , @xmath67 .",
    "we restate this theorem by saying that the set of divisor classes , @xmath68 such that by notation [ divnot ] , @xmath69 where @xmath70 , forms a basis for @xmath1 .",
    "we will prove this proposition by showing that all divisors corresponding to @xmath50 may be written as divisors corresponding to @xmath71 and then by justifying that this set of `` non - adjacent '' divisor classes indeed forms a basis .",
    "consider any divisor class , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a set of adjacent indices taken modulo @xmath2 , @xmath74 . by taking @xmath75=[m-1,m , m+p , m+p+1]$ ] , we have the following relation from theorem [ kepres ] : @xmath76 the left - hand side of equation is the sum of divisor classes , @xmath55 where @xmath16 is a set of non - adjacent indices , since the partition of any such @xmath16 is at least two sets of consecutive indices , one containing @xmath77 and the other containing @xmath78",
    ". the sets containing @xmath77 and @xmath78 can not be the same , because any consecutive ordering containing both @xmath77 and @xmath78 must contain either @xmath79 or @xmath80 , but there are no such terms on the left - hand side .",
    "the right - hand hand side is the sum of divisor classes , @xmath55 , such that @xmath16 contains @xmath77 and @xmath80 , and such that both @xmath79 and @xmath78 are contained in gaps .",
    "the only divisor class term indexed by a consecutive set is @xmath55 , @xmath81 .",
    "therefore for any set of adjacent indices @xmath73 , we may write equation as @xmath82 where the @xmath83 are all elements of the non - adjacent basis , and hence these divisor classes span the picard group",
    ".    furthermore , there are exactly @xmath84 non - adjacent divisors , which is the dimension of the picard group @xcite , so these elements indeed form a basis .",
    "in this section , we give a simple expression of each boundary divisor in @xmath1 in terms of any non - adjacent basis .",
    "this yields a new and very simple presentation for @xmath1 with a minimal set of relations .        where @xmath73 denotes a consecutive subset of points for the ordering @xmath85",
    ", @xmath88 denotes the set of non - adjacent subsets @xmath89 of @xmath90 such that @xmath73 is equal to a `` segment '' of even length @xmath91 or @xmath92 of @xmath93 , and @xmath94 denotes the set of non - adjacent subsets @xmath95 such that @xmath73 is equal to a `` segment '' of odd length @xmath96 or @xmath97 of @xmath93 .",
    "the beauty of the theorem is more easily seen by rephrasing it as : the coefficients of any divisor in the basis of the picard group given by a cyclic ordering can be calculated by the parity of the defining blocks of the divisor .",
    "the precise statement of the theorem does not do justice to its simplicity , as illustrated in the following example .      without loss of generality , we may prove this theorem on the standard cyclic ordering @xmath102 .",
    "let @xmath103 be set of divisors which is a basis for @xmath1 with respect to the cyclic order @xmath85 by proposition [ keel ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath104 $ ] an element of @xmath103 .",
    "let @xmath105 ( where indices are taken modulo @xmath2 ) be a consecutive subset for the cyclic order @xmath85 .",
    "then we may restate the theorem as follows .",
    "one can express @xmath72 as the linear combination of elements of @xmath103 : @xmath106,\\ ] ] and the coefficients are given by @xmath107 where for @xmath108 , @xmath109 is taken modulo @xmath2 .",
    "i claim that the left - hand side of equation is a sum of all of the divisor classes , @xmath55 , such that @xmath16 the @xmath73 is the disjoint union of an even number ( @xmath111 ) , of @xmath112 ( as in notation [ divnot ] ) and the right - hand side of this equation is the sum of @xmath55 such that @xmath73 can be expressed as the disjoint union of an odd number ( @xmath113 ) of @xmath114 .",
    "the justification of this claim proves the theorem .    any divisor class , @xmath55 , which is a term on the left - hand side of equation has a polygonal representation as in figure 3 .",
    "therefore @xmath73 is the disjoint union of the even number of sets , @xmath115 . while any divisor class , @xmath55 , which is a term on the right - hand side of has a polygonal representation as in figure 3 , so that @xmath73 is the disjoint union of an odd number of sets , @xmath116 .        .",
