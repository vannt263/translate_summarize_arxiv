    "peristalsis is a natural mechanism of pumping that is observed in the case of most physiological fluids . in the transport of some other fluids",
    "also peristaltic behaviour is observed .",
    "this behaviour is usually associated with a progressive wave of area contraction or expansion along the length of the boundary of a fluid - filled distensible tube .",
    "peristaltic transport occurs in various physiological activities , for example , in the flow of urine from kidney to the bladder , in the movement of food material through the digestive tract , in flow of fluids through lymphatic vessels as well as in semen movement in the vas differences , in the movement of bile from gall bladder into the duodenum and spermatozoa inside the ductus efferentes of the male reproductive tract and cervical canal , in flow of ovum in the fallopian tube , the movement of cilia and also in the flow of blood through small blood vessels .",
    "this phenomenon is also applied in the propulsion of some industrial fluids .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     this mechanism is also used in many biomedical appliances , such as finger pumps , heart - lung machine , blood pump machine , dialysis machine and also in industries for the transport of noxious fluid in nuclear industries , as well as in roller pumps . for this reason in current years",
    ", studies of peristaltic movement have been receiving growing interest of scientific researchers .",
    "much of the early literature of theoretical investigations , arranged according to the geometry , the type of fluids , the reynolds number , wave amplitude , wavelength and the wave shape , along with an account of experimental studies on peristaltic transport have been reviewed by srivastava and srivastava @xcite .",
    "some of the important theoretical studies on peristalsis have been discussed by eytan et al .",

    "@xcite , misra et al @xcite , maiti and misra @xcite , usha and rao @xcite , mishra and rao @xcite , rao and mishra @xcite , park et al @xcite as well as by akbar and nadeem@xcite .",
    "a few of these studies have been carried out by using the lubrication theory by neglecting the fluid inertia and wall curvature without any restriction of the wave amplitude .",
    "some other analyses are based on the consideration of small peristaltic wave amplitude , where the reynolds number is arbitrary .",
    "antanovskii and ramkissoon @xcite studied the peristaltic transport of a compressible viscous fluid through a pipe with the help of lubrication theory when the pressure drop changes with time , by taking into account the wall deformation of the pipe .",
    "bergel @xcite observed that the capillary walls are surrounded by flattened endothelial cell layers which are porous .",
    "dash et al .",
    "@xcite considered the brinkman equation to model blood flow in a coronary artery in the pathological state when clogging of blood occurs in the lumen of the artery .",
    "they assumed the clogged region as a porous medium and assumed the permeability to be constant / varying in the radial direction .",
    "misra et al .",
    "@xcite studied different aspects of blood flow in arteries in normal / pathological states .",
    "some models on blood rheology have been discussed by chien and skalak ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that most physiological fluids including blood behave as a non - newtonian fluid .",
    "it has been suggested that blood flow behaviour in small vessels ( of diameter less than 0.2 mm ) at low shear rate ( @xmath0 ) can be represented by a power law fluid @xcite .",
    "it was reported by blair and spanner @xcite that blood can be represented by casson s model for moderate shear rate flows .",
    "the non - newtonian behaviour of blood is mainly due to the suspension of red blood cells in the plasma .",
    "when neutrally buoyant corpuscles are contained in a fluid and there exists a velocity gradient due to shearing stress , corpuscles have rotatory motion .",
    "furthermore , it is observed that corpuscles have spin angular momentum , in addition to orbital angular momentum . as a result",
    ", the symmetry of stress tensor is lost in the fluid motion that is subjected to spin angular momentum .",
    "the fluid that has neutrally buoyant corpuscles , when observed macroscopically , exhibits non - newtonian behaviour , and its constitutive equation is expressed by a stress tensor@xcite .",
    "the radius of gyration of the corpuscles for such fluids is different from that of the fluid particles .",
    "their difference produces couple stress in the fluid .",
    "it is known that such a fluid has spin angular momentum in addition to the couple stress effect .",
    "the importance of consideration of couple stress effects in studies of physiological and some other fluids was indicated by cowin @xcite and beg et al @xcite .",
    "studies pertaining to the couple stress fluid behaviour are very useful , because such studies bear the potential to better explain the behaviour of rheologically complex fluids , such as liquid crystals , polymeric suspensions that has have long - chain molecules , lubrication as well as human / sub - human blood @xcite .",
    "valanis and sun @xcite as well as popel et al.@xcite remarked that couple stress fluids constitute a special class of non - newtonian fluids that take account of the particle size .",
    "the couple stress theory presented by stokes @xcite is quite suitable to study blood flow in micro - vessels by taking the size of the erythrocytes into account .",
    "shehawey and mekheimer @xcite analysed the flow of a couple stress fluid for any arbitrary reynolds number and wave number , considering the wave amplitude to be small .",
    "it may be mentioned that consideration of porosity is very much necessary to properly explain the fluid dynamical process that occurs in different parts of the body , such as vascular beds , lungs , kidneys and tumorous vessels .",
    "the importance of consideration of darcian drag effects in studies related to flow of blood and some other fluids through porous media has been discussed by different researchers @xcite . moreover , in many biomechanical studies , porosity of the media has significant influence on the transport of fluids .",
    "this applies more particularly to vessels impeded by clots and also to highly perfused skeletal tissues , tumors and to soft connecting tissues @xcite .",
    "some further discussion on vessel porosity and peristaltic flows of physiological fluids is available in several scientific publications @xcite .",
    "being motivated by the observations reported in the above mentioned studies , we have undertaken here a study that concerns peristaltic flow of blood in a porous bed . with an aim to take account of the particle size effect",
    ", blood has been modelled as a couple - stress fluid .",
    "the problem has been analysed by using lubrication theory @xcite . the analysis and the results of the study are particularly applicable to the peristaltic transport of blood in coronary arteries of smaller dimensions in the pathological state , when the lumen of the segment of a small blood vessel turns into a porous medium due to the presence of numerous blood clots , or when arterial clogging takes place by deposition of fatty plaques of cholesterol in the arterial lumen , and also in cases where numerous tumors are grown inside the lumen due to excessive cell division .",
    "the results of the present study will serve as a reasonably good estimate of various fluid mechanical parameters for peristaltic transport of blood in small blood vessels in a pathological state . since flow behaviour in an axi - symmetric vessel resembles that in a channel , we have studied here two - dimensional channel flow of the fluid .",
    "the results of this study will be applicable to blood vessels in the micro - circulatory system without any restriction .",
    "the study bears promise of multi - fold important applications . in the realm of physiological fluid dynamics , in many situations",
    "it is required to have estimates of a variety of fluid mechanical variables when some physiological fluid has to pass through porous structures , particularly in pathological states .",
    "the study will also have an important bearing in examining the flow in a vessel when the luminal surface of endothelial layer is attached with glycocalyx , which contains a series of micro - molecules and adsorbed plasma proteins .",
    "the present study can also find important applications in artificial bio - processors that have synthetic porous surfaces .",
    "since blood flowing in small vessels has got relevance with flow in porous media , the study is applicable to blood flow in micro - vessels more particularly in situations where couple stress effects of blood are prominent .",
    "in addition to all these , the analysis presented here should find applications in polymer industries , where it is often required to examine the flow behaviour of different types of fluids passing through porous structures .",
