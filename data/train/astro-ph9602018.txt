    "the parameters in ( [ fit ] ) are @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . on super",
    " horizon scales , where the source term is important , this fit is accurate to about @xmath56 . on small scales",
    "the accuracy reduces to a factor of 2 . by using this fit in the calculation of @xmath41 and @xmath42 from eqs.([dc ] ) we effectively neglect the time evolution of phases of @xmath57 ; the incoherent evolution of these phases may smear out subsequent doppler peaks ( albrech et al .",
    "1995 ) , but will not affect substantially the height of the first peak .",
    "in defect models of large scale structure formation one usually assumes that the universe begins in a hot , homogeneous state .",
    "all perturbation variables are zero , and the primordial fields ( e.g. , the global field @xmath47 in our case ) are in thermal equilibrium in the unbroken symmetry phase . when the phase transition occurs the original value @xmath58 becomes unstable and @xmath47 assumes a value which lies in the sphere of degenerate minima determined by @xmath59 .",
    "causality requires the correlation length to be bounded by the size of the horizon . on super  horizon scales the correlations vanish and therefore the defect stress energy tensor has a white noise power spectrum for @xmath60 . after the phase transition ,",
    "the defect energy rapidly enters scaling , @xmath61 . adopting this white noise behaviour of the field on super  horizon scales",
    ", one can simulate @xmath47 on scales much larger than the horizon scale at the phase transition .",
    "the only condition is that the scales considered are super  horizon at the time one starts the simulation .",
    "this is very important , since the scales relevant for large scale structure are more than 50 orders of magnitude larger than the inverse symmetry breaking scale @xmath62 .",
    "going back now to our set of eqs.([dc ] ) we will specify our initial conditions as follows : for a given scale @xmath50 we choose the initial time @xmath63 such that the perturbation is super  horizon and the universe is radiation dominated . in this limit",
    "the evolution equations reduce to @xmath64 with particular solutions @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in the above equations we have introduced @xmath67 , the only free parameter in the model .",
    "we consider perturbations seeded by the texture field , and therefore it is incorrect to add a homogeneous growing mode to the above solutions . with these initial conditions , eqs.([dc ] ) are easily integrated numerically , leading to the spectra for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "( see durrer , gangui & sakellariadou 1995 for details ) .",
    "in this section we calculate the expression for @xmath70 as a function of the baryon  radiation power spectrum and its derivative , evaluated at recombination , @xmath71 .",
    "we express the fourier transform of the velocity perturbation in the baryon  radiation component as @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "we then fourier transform the doppler contribution to the anisotropies given by eq.([doppler ] ) and perform a standard analysis to get the doppler contribution to the angular power spectrum @xmath70 .",
    "this is given as a function of the spectra for @xmath68 and @xmath69 as follows @xmath73 .",
    "% \\nonumber \\label{cldopp}\\ ] ] as we mentioned earlier , the source term in eqs.([dc ] ) was estimated from numerical simulations of the evolution of the defect field , which give a fit for the absolute value of @xmath47 , but do not specify the phases .",
    "the crossed term missing in eq.([cldopp ] ) , can not be determined with this method . however , due to phase averaging , we expect it to be diminished substantially and therefore we neglect it . integrating eq.([cldopp ] ) , we obtain the doppler contribution to the cmb anisotropies shown in figure 1 .",
    "as we see from the figure , the angular power spectrum @xmath74 yields the doppler peaks . for @xmath75 , we find three peaks located at @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "silk damping , which we have not taken into account here , will decrease the relative amplitude of the third peak with respect to the second one ; however it will not affect substantially the height of the first peak .",
    "the integrated sw effect , which also has been neglected , will shift the position of the first peak to somewhat larger scales , lowering @xmath79 by ( 5  10)% and possibly increasing its amplitude slightly ( by less than 30% ) ( durrer , gangui & sakellariadou 1995 ) .",
    "our second important result regards the amplitude of the first doppler peak , for which we find @xmath80 it is interesting to notice that the position of the first peak is displaced by @xmath81 towards smaller angular scales than in standard inflationary models ( steinhardt 1995 ) .",
    "this is due to the difference in the growth of super  horizon perturbations ( sugiyama 1996 ) , which is @xmath82 in our case , and @xmath83 for inflationary models .",
    "let us now compare our value for the doppler peak with the level of the sw plateau .",
    "unfortunately the numerical value for the sw amplitude is uncertain within a factor of about 2 , which leads to a factor 4 uncertainty in the sw contribution to the power spectrum : the results are @xmath84 ( bennett & rhie 1993 ; pen et al .",
    "1994 ) and @xmath85 ( durrer & zhou 1995 ) .",
    "according to the first two groups , the doppler peak is a factor of @xmath86 times higher than the sw plateau , whereas it is only about 1.5 times higher if the second result is assumed .",
    "( we allow for about 30% of the sw amplitude to be added in phase to the doppler amplitude of @xmath87 . ) improved numerical simulations or analytical approximations are needed to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "however , it is apparent that the doppler contribution from textures is somewhat smaller than for generic inflationary models .",
    "we believe that our results , about the position and amplitude of the first doppler peak , are basically valid for all global defects .",
    "this depends crucially on the @xmath88 behavior of @xmath89 on large scales ( cf .",
    "( [ fit ] ) ) .",
    "the displacement of the peaks towards smaller scales is reminiscent of open models , where the first doppler peak is located at @xmath90 .",
    "a value @xmath91 would produce @xmath92 for the first peak , as we actually find .",
    "however , the amplitude of the peaks within open inflationary models is generically larger than the one we find for global defects ."
