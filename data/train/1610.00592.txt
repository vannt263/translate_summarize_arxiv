    "the free - energy is assumed to be a non - convex function of the concentration , so that the system naturally phase - separates . a contribution to the free - energy from the concentration gradient results in the formation of a diffuse phase - boundary between phases .",
    "phase - field models have several advantages .",
    "since the phase variable is continuous , explicit interface tracking is unnecessary .",
    "their variational nature aids the development of stable numerical methods .",

    "the standard cahn - hilliard equations predict that the interface has infinite mobility thus ignoring the nonequilibrium interface behaviour which can be important in nanoscale electrodes . following langer and sekerka @xcite",
