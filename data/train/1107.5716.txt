    "the multiple quantum ( mq ) nmr @xcite is not only a powerful tool for the investigation of nuclear spin distributions in solids but also an effective method to study mq nmr coherence relaxation in large systems of highly correlated spins @xcite . with this tool",
    ", one can estimate the decoherence time @xcite and a possible distance of the quantum information transfer @xcite .",
    "these parameters of quantum systems are important for quantum information processing @xcite",
    ".    however , dipolar coupling constants in real physical spin systems do not remain time - independent because of such effects as molecular motions and imperfect experimental realizations of the two - spin / two - quantum hamiltonian @xcite together with the effect of high order corrections @xcite to the average hamiltonian theory @xcite .",
    "all these effects lead to uncontrolled variations of the dipolar coupling constants .",
    "a fluctuating nanopore filled with a gas of spin - carrying ( @xmath0 ) molecules ( atoms ) is a suitable model for the study of the mq nmr dynamics with variable dipolar coupling constants @xcite .",
    "this study is stimulated by experimental results concerning fluctuations in nanostructures .",
    "for example , fluctuating nanostructures emerge in carbon nanotubes @xcite driven by mechanical or electrical excitation .",
    "other examples include gas vesicles @xcite and nanobubbles of insoluble gas in a liquid @xcite .",
    "we expect that the results obtained in our paper can be useful for experimental investigations of fluctuations in nanopore materials . because of the nanopore fluctuations , the dipolar coupling constant , averaged over molecular motion , fluctuates as well .",
    "since the characteristic time of molecular movements is much less than the spin flip - flop times , the averaged dipolar coupling constant is the same for all spin pairs @xcite even in fluctuating nanopores .",
    "jeener has recently shown @xcite that the mean field approach involving the distant dipolar field @xcite leads to the results which are analogous to those obtained in @xcite , if equilibrium fluctuations are taken into account in the estimation of the dipolar field .",
    "the nuclear spin dynamics and the nmr line shape of a nuclear spin system placed in a fluctuating nanocontainer was investigated in @xcite on the basis of the method developed in ref.@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the mq nmr dynamics of spin - carrying ( @xmath0 ) molecules ( atoms ) of a gas in the fluctuating nanopores .",
    "we investigate the relaxation ( decoherence ) of the mq coherence intensities using the method developed in refs . @xcite and applying the theoretical approach explored in refs .",
    "the latter allows us to study the mq nmr spin dynamics in a system of hundreds of equivalent spins . in particular , it becomes possible to investigate the growth of the mq coherence clusters in a fluctuating nanopore .",
    "assuming gaussian character of nanopore fluctuations we can investigate the mq nmr dynamics at different variances and correlation times of the fluctuations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical approach to mq nmr dynamics in the fluctuating nanopores is developed in sec.[section : theory ] .",
    "the numerical simulation of the evolution of mq nmr coherences in the system of 201 equivalent spins as well as the evolution of the mq nmr coherence clusters is presented in sec.[section : numerics ] .",
    "we briefly summarize our results and discuss further perspectives in the concluding sec.[section : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider the mq nmr experiment with a gas of @xmath1 spin - carrying ( @xmath0 ) particles in a fluctuating nanopore which is placed in the strong external magnetic field @xmath2 directed along @xmath3-axis @xcite .",
    "the mq nmr experiment consists of four distinct periods of time ( see fig.[fig:0]@xmath4 ) : preparation ( @xmath5 ) , evolution ( @xmath6 ) , mixing ( @xmath5 ) and detection . on the preparation period ,",
    "the spin system is irradiated by the proper multipulse sequence of radio - frequency pulses , rotating spins by @xmath7 around the @xmath8 axis ( so - called @xmath7 pulses ) , see fig.[fig:0]@xmath9 . as a result",
    ", the dynamics of the spin system is described by the effective hamiltonian @xmath10 in the rotating reference frame ( fig.[fig:0]@xmath4 ) .",
    "we consider two types of pulse sequences on the preparation period depicted in fig.[fig:0]@xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the first one ( fig.[fig:0]@xmath11 ) is the standard pulse sequence resulting in the averaged nonsecular two - spin / two - quantum hamiltonina @xmath13 @xcite , i.e. @xmath14 . the second pulse sequence was introduced in @xcite , see fig.[fig:0]@xmath12 .",
    "it yields the modified expression for @xmath10 which is explored below .",
    "our subsequent results are based on two assumptions : ( @xmath15 ) the characteristic time of the nanopore fluctuations is much longer than that of molecular motion in the nanopore and ( @xmath16 ) the characteristic time of fluctuations is also much longer than the period of the pulse sequence in fig.[fig:0]@xmath11 .",
    "then the mq nmr dynamics on the preparation period is governed by the following two - spin / two - quantum hamiltonian @xmath13 @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the total raising and lowering operators , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the projection operator of the spin angular momentum on the axis @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the dipolar coupling constant in the fluctuating nanopore , @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath26 is the volume of the nanopore , @xmath27 is the form - factor , depending on the shape of the nanopore , and @xmath28 is the angle determining the orientation of the nanopore with respect to the external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the explicit expression for the form - factor @xmath27 associated with the ellipsoidal nanopore can be found in ref .",
    "( [ dt0 ] ) shows that the value of the coupling constant significantly depends on the orientation of the nanopore and vanishes at the so - called  magic  angle @xmath29 @xcite defined as @xmath30 .",
    "we also need the hamiltonian , responsible for secular dipole - dipole interactions in the fluctuating nanopore @xcite , @xmath31 and the expression for the hamiltonian @xmath10 , governing the spin dynamics on the modified preparation period ( cf .",
    "ref.@xcite ; see fig.[fig:0]@xmath12 ) , @xmath32 where @xmath33 .    for a fluctuating nanopore ,",
    "we may write @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the average dipolar coupling constant while @xmath36 is its fluctuation .",
    "hereafter we assume the gaussian fluctuations of the coupling constant @xmath23 @xcite and characterize the gaussian random noise , @xmath36 , by the first two moments @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the fluctuation variance and @xmath39 denotes the correlation function . in many cases @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the correlation time .",
    "an important property of the hamiltonian @xmath13 ( [ hmq ] ) is that it commutes with the operator of the square of the total spin angular momentum @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "since the operator @xmath42 commutes with @xmath43 , it is suitable to study the mq nmr dynamics in a nanopore using the basis of common eigenvectors of the operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "this choice of the basis allows us to split the problem into a set of simpler problems for different values of @xmath42 .",
    "this resolves the problem of the hilbert space dimension growth with the increase in the number of spins . owing to this simplification it becomes possible to investigate the mq nmr dynamics in systems consisting of several hundreds of spins and to calculate the profiles of the intensities of mq nmr coherences ( the intensities of mq nmr coherences versus their order ) @xcite .",
    "eq.([hmq ] ) shows that the same simplification is also valid for a fluctuating nanopore .    in order to investigate the mq nmr dynamics",
    ", one should first find the density matrix @xmath44 solving the liouville evolution equation @xcite @xmath45\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the initial density matrix @xmath46 written for the high temperature approximation @xcite . here",
    "@xmath47 is the boltsman constant , @xmath48 is the temperature and @xmath49 . introducing the new variable    @xmath50    one can rewrite eq.([liouville ] ) as follows : @xmath51,\\\\\\label{bhmq } & & \\bar h_{mq}=   -\\frac{\\langle d \\rangle } { 4 } \\{(i^+)^2+(i^-)^2\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the usual equation ( up to some notations ) for the mq nmr dynamics .",
    "the solution of eq.([l2 ] ) was studied numerically in @xcite .",
    "a similar consideration may be given to the evolution of the density matrix under the secular hamiltonian @xmath52 .",
    "following the results of refs.@xcite we represent the solution of eq.([l2 ] ) , @xmath53 as the sum of the contributions @xmath54 responsible for the mq nmr coherences of different orders @xmath47 ( @xmath55 ) @xmath56 the intensities @xmath57 ( @xmath55 ) of the mq nmr coherences were found in ref.@xcite : @xmath58 we also consider the decay of the mq coherence intensities in the mq nmr experiment with the modified preparation period @xcite ( see fig.[fig:0]@xmath12 ) concatenating the short evolution periods @xmath59 under the averaged over fluctuations secular dipole - dipole hamiltonian ( [ hdz ] ) @xmath60 ( which is considered as a perturbation ) with the evolution period @xmath61 under the nonsecular average two - spin / two - quantum hamiltonian @xmath62 ( [ bhmq ] ) .",
    "then the the hamiltonian @xmath10 ( [ heff0 ] ) averaged over fluctuations is @xcite @xmath63 in this case , the intensities of the mq coherences @xmath64 are the following @xcite : @xmath65 here we use the following representation for the density matrix @xmath66 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the contribution to @xmath66 from the mq coherence of the @xmath47th order .",
    "we will use both intensities ( [ j1 ] ) and ( [ j2 ] ) in our calculations .",
    "it is suitable to write @xmath69 where @xmath70 by the definition of the dirac delta function one has the following identity : @xmath71 using the integral representation of the @xmath72-function , @xmath73 we transform eq.([j_kx ] ) to the following one : @xmath74 this equation can be easily averaged over fluctuations .",
    "first of all , averaging both sides of eq.([j_kx2 ] ) one can write : @xmath75 it is known that @xcite @xmath76 for the gaussian fluctuations , where @xmath77 substituting eqs.([exp ] ) and ( [ t ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ j_kx2avr ] ) one can obtain after simple calculations : @xmath78 eq.([j_kx2avr_tr ] ) will be used in sec.[section : numerics ] for study of the dependencies of the mq nmr coherence intensities on different variances and correlation times of the fluctuations in the system consisting of 201 spins . here",
    "the intensities @xmath79 are defined by one of the formulas ( [ j1 ] ) or ( [ j2 ] ) and the correlation function , @xmath39 , is taken from eq.([c ] ) in all calculations . substituting eq.([c ] ) into eq.([t ] ) one obtains @xmath80 eq.([j_kx2avr_tr ] ) shows that the fluctuation effect is characterized by the function @xmath81 which takes the following form in view of eq.([tc ] ) : @xmath82 if @xmath83 , then one has @xmath84 so that the fluctuations are characterized by a single dimensionless parameter @xmath85 which is a product of the relative variance @xmath86 and the dimensionless correlation time @xmath87 .",
    "another limit is @xmath88 .",
    "then one has @xmath89 so that the fluctuations are completely characterized by the relative variance @xmath90 .",
    "the mq nmr dynamics of spin bearing molecules in a fluctuating nanopore can be characterized by the averaged ( over the fast molecular motion in the nanopore ) dipolar coupling constant , @xmath91 , by the variance , @xmath92 and by the correlation time , @xmath41 , of the fluctuations .",
    "we use such dimensionless parameters as the relative variance @xmath93 , the time @xmath94 and the correlation time @xmath95 which are introduced as follows : @xmath96 first , we consider the influence of the fluctuations on the profiles of the mq nmr coherence intensities in the standard mq nmr experiment @xcite with the spin-1/2 particle system of 201 equivalent spins .",
    "one has to emphasize that the mq nmr coherence intensities are quickly oscillating functions in the system of equivalent spins @xcite .",
    "for this reason , in order to construct the profiles of the mq nmr coherence intensities we consider the intensities @xmath97 ( see eq.([j1 ] ) ) averaged over the sufficiently long time interval @xmath98 and find the profiles of these averaged intensities , see ref.@xcite . now , taking into account the fluctuations , we observe that the fluctuations smooth out the oscillations of the coherence intensities .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig.[fig : smooth ] , where the evolution of zero - order coherence @xmath99 is represented for different relative variances @xmath93 and correlation times @xmath95 .",
    "we see that , while reducing oscillations , the fluctuations do not change the mean value of the zero order coherence @xmath100 .",
    "the same conclusion is valid for the higher order coherence intensities as well .",
    "thus , one can expect that fluctuations do not change the profiles of the mq nmr coherence intensities averaged over the long time interval .",
    "the latter conclusion is justified by the direct calculations of the mq nmr profiles for the system of 201 spin-1/2 particles for the fluctuations with different relative variances and correlation times .",
    "since profiles are not affected by the fluctuations in the standard mq nmr experiment , we do not discuss this case in more details .",
    "now we refer to the experiments with a modified preparation period , where the decay of mq nmr coherences is inherent in the preparation period @xcite .",
    "intensities of mq nmr coherences are given by eq.([j2 ] ) in this case .",
    "we study the fluctuation effect on the evolution of the coherence clusters . by the coherence cluster we mean the set of coherences having intensities @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "it is obtained that the fluctuations effect both the maximal size of the coherence cluster @xmath102 and the formation time of this cluster @xmath103 .",
    "this is demonstrated in figs.[fig : pp ] , where the evolution of the coherence cluster size is shown for two values of the parameter @xmath104 ( @xmath105 in figs.[fig : pp](@xmath106 ) and @xmath107 in figs.[fig : pp](@xmath108 ) ) and different relative variances and correlation times of fluctuations .",
    "these figures demonstrate that , in general , the evolution of the cluster size @xmath109 depends on both the relative variance @xmath93 and the correlation time @xmath95 .",
    "however , the correlation time effect disappears , if @xmath110 , which follows from eq.([tappr2 ] ) .",
    "this fact is suitably reflected in table [ table : d1 ] , where the maximal cluster sizes @xmath111 and the time moments of their formation @xmath103 for @xmath105 and @xmath107 , corresponding to the relative variance @xmath112 and different correlation times @xmath113 are represented . in fact , parameters @xmath114 and @xmath103 corresponding to @xmath115 and @xmath116 , are essentially the same , which is valid for both @xmath105 and @xmath107",
    ". this conclusion agrees with eq.([tappr2 ] ) , where only the relative variance is represented as a parameter responsible for the fluctuations .    on the other hand ,",
    "the relative variance effects considerably on the cluster evolution no matter how big this variance is .",
    "in fact , the relative variance is present in all three formulas ( [ t2]-[tappr2 ] ) so that it is a significant parameter of spin dynamics .",
    "this is demonstrated in figs.[fig : pp](@xmath117 ) as well as in table [ table : tc1 ] , where the parameters @xmath118 and @xmath119 for @xmath105 and @xmath107 , corresponding to the correlation time @xmath120 , and different relative variances @xmath93 are collected .    .",
    "the maximal cluster size @xmath118 and the time moment of its formation @xmath103 for the relative variance @xmath121 and different correlation times @xmath95 .",
    "the appropriate parameters of the spin system without fluctuations are the following : @xmath122 , @xmath123 for @xmath124 and @xmath125 , @xmath126 for @xmath127 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we consider fluctuations of the dipole - dipole interaction constant @xmath128 in a system of equivalent spin-1/2 particles .",
    "it is found that the fluctuations smooth out the evolution of the mq nmr coherence intensities .",
    "this is the only fluctuation effect unless the decay process is involved .",
    "decay of the mq nmr coherences has been considered in the mq nmr experiment with the modified preparation period @xcite , where short periods of mq coherence formation alternate with short periods of their decay .",
    "we find that the fluctuations affect both the maximal size of the coherence cluster and the period of its formation .",
    "namely , the maximal cluster size and the period of its formation decrease with the increase in both the relative variance @xmath93 and the correlation time @xmath95 .",
    "however , the effect of the correlation time is reduced if @xmath129 .",
    "although a nanopore is a rather specific quantum object , the numerical results obtained for it may be useful for study of the fluctuation effects in other objects .",
    "however , numerical simulation of the fluctuation effects in quantum systems , different from nanopores , is much more complicated because of the exponential growth of the hilbert space dimension with the increase in the number of the spins , involved in the quantum process . a detailed study of different aspects of the mq nmr dynamics @xcite is aimed at the increase of the power of the mq nmr spectroscopy in the investigation of the properties and structures of different physical objects .",
    "using our approach , the information about volumes , shapes and orientations of nanopores in materials with identical nanopores can be readily extracted .",
    "it is also possible to obtain information about the distribution of nanopore parameters in a system with non - identical nanopores @xcite .",
    "in particular , information about orientations of nanopores can be deduced from the free induction decay ( fid ) using different orientations of the sample with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "in fact , the long time behavior of the fid is determined mainly by the nanocavities , where the dipolar coupling constants between spin - carring atoms ( molecules ) are vanishing , which corresponds to the so - called `` magic '' angle orientation of the nanopore . @xcite .",
    "the obtained results can be also averaged over the orientations of nanopores .",
    "all numerical simulations have been performed using the resources of the joint supercomputer center ( jscc ) of russian academy of sciences .",
