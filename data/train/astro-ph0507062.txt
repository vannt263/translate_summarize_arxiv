    "molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath9 ) emission lines include some of the brightest lines in the near infrared k - band and are therefore commonly targeted as diagnostic lines .",
    "comparing the ratios in several or more rotational and vibrational transitions allows one to probe the physical conditions of molecular clouds which are illuminated by incident far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation or heated by shocks .",
    "a number of authors have also suggested that x - ray irradiation from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) may excite bright h@xmath9 line emission , a conclusion based primarily on the ratio of the h@xmath9 1 - 0s(1 ) line to other emission lines or quantities @xcite .",
    "@xcite thought that this could be important , but that shocks excited by nuclear outflows is a likely mechanism for heating h@xmath9 in many seyfert  2 galaxies .",
    "@xcite rule out x - ray heating as the dominant source of h@xmath9 emission due to the lack of correlation between 1 - 0s(1 ) and hard x - ray flux . instead",
    ", because they spatially resolve the h@xmath9 in a number of seyfert  2 galaxies and one seyfert  1 , they suggest that a variety of different processes are probably involved depending on the object .",
    "the extended nature of the h@xmath9 emission in this seyfert  1 was confirmed by @xcite , who also found extended h@xmath9 emission in other type  1 agn @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we address the issue of h@xmath9 excitation in and around agn from a different perspective : using the ratios of the h@xmath9 lines themselves across several vibrational levels to constrain the dominant excitation mechanism .",
    "this can be a very powerful tool as shown , for example , by our application of h@xmath9 excitation models to ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) @xcite .",
    "the evidence above that h@xmath9 can be extended in both type  1 and type  2 agn suggests that active star formation , which typically occurs over large ( 0.1 - 1kpc ) scales , could be a good candidate for its origin .",
    "this premise is strengthened by the increasing evidence for active star formation in the tens to hundreds of parsecs around both seyfert  2s @xcite and seyfert  1s @xcite .",
    "we therefore address whether : ( 1 ) the dominant h@xmath9 excitation mechanism either close around an agn or in its wider environment is consistent with excitation in photo - dissocation regions , as one might expect if it originates from star formation ; and ( 2 ) whether suppression of the 2 - 1s(3 ) can be taken as an indicator of x - ray irradiated gas in agn , as has been proposed theoretically and observationally @xcite .",
    "to do so , we have undertaken longslit observations of the 9 seyfert galaxies listed in table  [ tab : basdat ] , including both type  1 and type  2 seyferts , although the classification is often an indistinct issue . in order to analyse these ,",
    "we have divided them into two groups : five which are near enough ( @xmath10mpc ) to study both the nuclear and circumnuclear h@xmath9 line ratios separately ; four which are further away ( @xmath11mpc ) , and for which only a nuclear spectrum was extracted .    after describing the observations and data reduction in section  [ sec : obs ] , we discuss how the stellar continuum was removed and the line fluxes measured in section  [ sec : contfit ] .",
    "notes on the individual objects in our sample are given in section  [ sec : notes ] before addressing the issues of star formation around the agn and h@xmath9 excitation in sections  [ sec : starform ] and  [ sec : poplev ] respectively .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "our data were obtained as part of the service observing programme at the _ very large telescope _ between may and august 2002 in seeing of typically 0.8  in the k - band .",
    "acquisition images with integration times of a few seconds were taken before each spectrum through a narrow band filter near to 2.1 .",
    "these are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : acq ] together with the orientation of the slit across the nucleus of each object .",
    "the position angle of the slit was set to lie along the major axis of the object as determined from 2mass k - band or red digitised sky survey images . where there was no clear axis ,",
    "the slit was set east - west .",
    "isaac was used in medium resolution mode in the k - band , providing a nominal resolution of @xmath0 with a 1  slit .",
    "since the wavelength coverage in this mode is only 0.122 , two settings were used with an overlap of 510% .",
    "the total integration time was 2000seconds per setting .",
    "standard calibrations were performed , including atmospheric standard stars ( type b or g2v ) , arcs , flatfields , and dark frames .",
    "the data were reduced using pc - iraf  2.11.3 using standard techniques .",
    "wavelength calibration was achieved by tracing the sky lines to create a transformation which removed curvature , at the same time as applying the final wavelength scale .",
    "it was found that the spectral slope in each row of the object spectra had a small residual curvature which depended on the position of the row .",
    "this curvature was removed without affecting the overall slope of each spectrum , allowing a much better merging of the two wavelength segments .",
    "however , this does mean there could be some uncertainty in the slope of the resulting spectra .",
    "the merging was performed on the 2-dimensional spectra , convolving the observation which had better seeing with a moffat function to match the one which had poorer seeing . at the same time",
    "the fluxes of the two spectra were scaled according to their overlapping regions .",
    "the flux calibration was derived from the standard stars , the k - band magnitudes of which were extracted from the 2mass point source catalogue .",
    "there was a very good correspondance between these magnitudes and those estimated from the colour of the spectral type and v - band magnitude , the difference being on average 0.15mag .",
    "slit losses are compensated to zero order by the standard star for each observation .",
    "no further correction was applied since the main theme of the analysis involves line ratios rather than absolute fluxes . since also",
    "the change in atmospheric dispersion in the k - band is small , the data are unaffected by differential slit losses .",
    "the final step in the data reduction was to de - rotate the spectra , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : derotate ] , to straighten the rotation curves",
    ". the advantage this brings is twofold .",
    "it restricts the spectral width of all the lines ( emission and absorption ) in a spectrum extracted over a long aperture ; and it decorrelates the noise introduced by systematic residuals from imperfect telluric correction , since these features are no longer aligned with the spatial axis . thus the signal to noise in the spectral features that we wish to measure is significantly increased .",
    "the procedure was performed on the 5 nearby objects , since their rotation curves could be traced out beyond the nucleus . for each of these",
    ", the velocity shift of the 1 - 0s(1 ) line was measured in each spatial row where the line was sufficiently well detected .",
    "these rows were shifted to a zero offset position .",
    "all other spatial rows were shifted according to a function ( the error function , since it provides a simple smooth approximation to a typical rotation curve ) which was fit to the rows where the line offset could be measured .",
    "for all the galaxies listed in table  [ tab : basdat ] , we have extracted spectra from the nuclear region , which we define as the central 1  ( to match the typical seeing ) .",
    "this includes everything within 60pc ( for the nearby galaxies ) or 190pc ( for the more distant galaxies ) of the agn .",
    "additionally , for the nearby galaxies we have extracted a circumnuclear spectrum , which we define as everything outside the central 2  ( to reject any nuclear emission ) and up to 1kpc from the agn .",
    "estimations of the contamination of the circumnuclear flux by the nuclear flux in each case and for the ambient seeing indicate that this is less than 10% in the worst case and typically 1% or less .    as for our previous work on ultraluminous galaxies",
    "@xcite , we have fit stellar templates ( f  m type supergiants from the library of @xcite ) to the continuum in order to be able to measure the line emission accurately . however , because of the broad br@xmath4 in most of the nuclear spectra , it was not practical to mask out regions with line emission .",
    "instead , spectra were fit simultaneously with stellar templates and both broad and narrow emission lines .",
    "the wavelengths of the lines were fixed , and they were assumed to have the same redshift as the stellar continuum . however , the minimisation was allowed to adjust the velocity width of the lines ( one width for all the narrow lines , and one for all the broad lines ) .",
    "while this procedure can match the continuum well , it provides poor estimates of ( particularly the weak ) line fluxes  since these are affected by local over-/underestimates in the relative level of the continuum .",
    "the line fluxes were therefore remeasured by fitting gaussian functions of fixed width to the spectrum after the fitted continuum had been subtracted .",
    "the uncertainties were estimated from the standard deviation of the local residual ( covering a spectral range 10 times the fwhm of the line ) and the line widths using monte carlo techniques .",
    "specifically , a spectral segment was constructed to have the same statistical noise properties as the actual residual spectrum , to which a gaussian profile of the measured flux and fwhm was added .",
    "a new gaussian profile was then fitted to the segment , producing slightly different parameters .",
    "this was repeated 10000 times , yielding the uncertainties .",
    "limits were derived in a similar way .",
    "we caution that while this treatment accurately estimates uncertainty from random noise , it can not account for systematic error such as    the absolute flux scaling is given in table  [ tab : measdat ] , and the line ratios and uncertainties are tabulated in table  [ tab : ratios ] .",
    "the circumnuclear spectra of all the targets except ngc5506 had deep absorption features . for these we assumed",
    "there was no contribution from hot dust , but allowed the extinction to vary in order to match the spectral slope . for ngc5506 ,",
    "the very weak nai absorption at 2.206  suggests that the near infrared is not dominated by late - type stars , perhaps because there is a significant hot dust component  even away from the nucleus .",
    "the residual broad br@xmath4 also suggests that there may be some contamination from the nucleus . for this spectrum",
    "we not only allowed the extinction to vary , but added a thermal component at @xmath12k representing hot dust .",
    "although there is some degeneracy between these two effects since they both change the spectral slope , the primary aim is to remove the effect of the absorption features rather than uniquely identify the components comprising the continuum ; and in this respect the process is successful . the results of this continuum fitting procedure for the circumnuclear regions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circum - spec - near ] .    in all cases except ngc1097 ,",
    "the stellar features in the nuclear spectra are much less clearly defined .",
    "there are two important reasons for this : 1 ) the redder spectral slope indicates that there is a significant contribution from hot dust , which dilutes the stellar continuum and adds to the noise ; 2 ) one would expect a higher velocity dispersion in the nucleus ( particularly if the stellar population is dynamically hot ) which , combined with the steep rotation curve ( albeit corrected ) and seeing lead to a large broadening of the features . in fitting the continuum",
    "we have , in each case except ngc1097 , left both the @xmath12k hot dust contribution and the extinction as free parameters .",
    "the results of the continuum fitting procedure for the nuclear regions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuclear - spec - near ] for the nearby objects and fig .",
    "[ fig : nuclear - spec - far ] for the more distant objects .",
    "in this section we summarise some notes about the objects in our sample , in order to put into context our data and the results we discuss later .      the classification of ngc1097 as a seyfert  1 is based on its broad h@xmath13 line @xcite and hard x - ray excess @xcite , although the agn is low luminosity .",
    "the black hole mass is nevertheless expected to be @xmath14@xmath15m@xmath16 , based on the stellar velocity dispersion and m@xmath17 relation @xcite  an order of magnitude more massive than that in the very active ngc7469 @xcite .",
    "monitoring the broad h@xmath13 over a timespan of 11yrs , @xcite indicated that the luminosity decreased to 1/3 of its initial value over this period . during our observations",
    "there was no evidence of broad br@xmath4 and , assuming a velocity width of 7500  fwhm ( similar to that for the total broad h@xmath13 line ) , we can impose a 3@xmath18 limit of @xmath19  ( 1  aperture ) just consistent with the broad h@xmath13 flux measured towards the end of 2001 if extinction is negligible .",
    "however , it is plausible and more likely that the broad component continued dimming towards the middle of 2002 when our data were taken .",
    "the narrow br@xmath4 is also weak in the nucleus , with a flux of @xmath20  in a 1  aperture , indicating that there is little current star formation .",
    "the last episode may have ceased relatively recently , as suggested by the very deep absorption features which even with the use of supergiant templates we have difficulty matching .",
    "ngc1097 therefore offers an excellent opportunity to study the distribution and dynamics of the stars in the region close around a ( quiescent ) agn .",
    "our detection of strong h@xmath9 1 - 0s(1 ) in the nuclear region is in stark contrast to the lack of such emission in the spectrum of @xcite , and we can offer no explanation for this difference .    ngc1097 exhibits a very clear and well studied circumnuclear ring @xcite , which is also apparent in our data from the increase in br@xmath4 flux at radii of 89 .",
    "ngc1365 , a strongly barred galaxy in the fornax cluster , has been reviewed extensively by @xcite .",
    "its agn exhibits both broad and narrow components to the h@xmath13 line , the fwhm of the former being 1800  @xcite , somewhat wider than the @xmath12  we find for the br@xmath4 line .",
    "assigning 1800  to the broad component in our data would only be possible if the narrow component had fwhm 500 , in conflict with @xcite reporting it as unresolved .",
    "the soft x - ray ( 0.12.5kev ) luminosity , which can in principle be explained entirely in terms of star formation , suggests the agn is of rather low luminosity @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of a relatively unabsorbed power law component at higher ( up to 10kev ) energies and a 6.6kev fe  k emission line indicate that there must be an agn @xcite .",
    "the ionisation cone , seen in [ oiii ] and with kinematics indicative of outflowing gas , was modelled by @xcite , who found that the cone axis lay close to the galaxy s rotation axis and the opening angle was sufficient to include the line of sight to the partially obscured seyfert nucleus .",
    "the galaxy has a prominent circumnuclear ring at a distance of 510from the nucleus , which is actively forming stars .",
    "it has been observed in both recombination line and optical / infrared / radio continuum emission and is also clearly seen in our data .",
    "ngc2992 exhibits an extended biconical narrow line region on kpc scales @xcite , which traces outflowing gas .",
    "@xcite were able to model the kinematics in terms of gas rotating in the disk plane and a biconical outflow , and argue that the latter is a thermal wind driven by the agn rather than vigorous star formation . on smaller scales , there is a figure-8 loop of radio continuum and h@xmath13 emission , centered on the nucleus and extending to about 500pc @xcite . using adaptive optics to reach a resolution @xmath21 , @xcite proposed that the loop structure is in fact a superposition of emission from star formation along a spiral arm in the disk and outflow bubbles coincident with the larger scale structures .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , our data show a very significant reduction in the equivalent width of the stellar absorption features ( whether 2.293  co2 - 0 or 2.206  nai ) at the nucleus , which is most easily explained in terms of dilution due to hot dust .",
    "the generally accepted classification of ngc2992 as a seyfert  2 ( or 1.9 ) is perhaps surprising given that it exhibits broad emission lines in the optical and near infrared .",
    "however , given that in the model of @xcite the line of sight is very close to the edge of ( but not within ) the opening angle of the outflow from the agn , a classification close to type  2 makes sense with respect to the standard orientation dependent model .      in hard x - rays ( 210kev )",
    ", ngc5506 is one of the most luminous local seyferts @xcite , making it rather unusual amongst type  2s .",
    "however , its x - ray properties are more consistent with those of narrow line seyfert  1s which , based on its j - band spectrum , ngc5506 appears to be @xcite .",
    "our data tend to support this classification .",
    "a detailed study of the kinematics of the double peaked lines by @xcite suggested that the object is a nearly edge - on seyfert .",
    "their model , a refined version of that proposed by @xcite , has the disk plane inclined by 75@xmath22 , above and below which ionised gas is outflowing in cones extend with opening angle @xmath23 .",
    "a highly inclined geometry is consistent with the hard x - ray spectrum , for which the lack of evidence for an accretion disk from the ionised component of the 6.4kev iron line suggests that it must be nearly edge - on @xcite .",
    "@xcite also argue that , based on the observed trends in emission line ratios , there is significant star formation occuring at distances of 300400pc from the nucleus that can account for about half of the h@xmath13 emission .",
    "our data confirm the evidence for active star formation close to the agn , showing symmetrical dips in the 1 - 0s(1)/br@xmath4 ratio at offsets of @xmath2422.5(250300pc ) from the nucleus .",
    "ngc7582 is the brightest narrow line x - ray galaxy , and perhaps prototypical of this class @xcite . that it has an agn",
    "can not be doubted , due to the rapid and large variations in hard ( 210kev ) x - ray flux occuring while the soft ( 0.52kev ) x - ray flux remianed constant @xcite , and the presence of an [ oiii ] ionisation cone @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted the appearance and subsequent variations in a broad component to several optical emission lines .",
    "we also have detected a broad bump in the k - band spectrum , which most likely corresponds to broad ( @xmath25 ) br@xmath4 .",
    "this is also apparent in the nuclear spectrum of @xcite , who noted the complex morphologies of the emission lines .",
    "@xcite reached no consensus on whether this type  2 to type  1 transition was due to the appearance of type iin supernovae or to patchy obscuration in the torus aorund the agn . by examining the fuv flux",
    ", @xcite found evidence for young stars in the nucleus ( central 2 ) of ngc7582 , superimposed on the older bulge population .",
    "we also see relatively strong nai absorption in the spectrum of the central 100pc .",
    "on the other hand , the equivalent width of this absorption feature decreases steadily from a radius of @xmath243  ( 300pc ) to a minimum at the nucleus of @xmath26 .",
    "this feature could imply a transition to a rather young stellar population , or more likely the presence of hot dust grains  although whether the heating on such extended scales can be attributed to the agn is unclear .",
    "an _ hst _ image of mrk1044 shows it to be a spiral galaxy inclined by about @xmath27 from face - on @xcite , and it is included in the list of 59 narrow line seyfert  1 galaxies complied by @xcite . as is typical of such objects",
    ", it has a steep soft x - ray photon index and shows some variability @xcite . a spectrum covering 0.82.4micron  presented by @xcite shows no emission lines in the h - band and , as also found by @xcite and ourselves , only br@xmath4 in the k - band .",
    "although their spectrum becomes somewhat less sparsely populated shortward of the h - band , presumably because the dilution of features by hot dust continuum is much less , they still do not detect any coronal lines . in this galaxy",
    "we detect neither stellar absorption features , nor h@xmath9 line emission ( compact or extended ) .",
    "this paucity of emission or absorption features makes it extremely difficult to draw any conclusions about excitation mechanisms or dynamics .",
    "ngc1194 is a highly inclined spiral galaxy .",
    "it was classified as a seyfert  1 by @xcite , who were surveying warm iras sources , based on optical line widths and ratios . in a survey of 12  galaxies , @xcite ( who classed it as a type  2 , as given in the original sample definition ) obtained a 2.84.1  spectrum of this object , finding no 3.3  pah emission , but evidence for coronal [ siix ] at 3.9 .",
    "our detection of only narrow br@xmath4 would tend to support the seyfert  2 classification .",
    "@xcite observed strong co bandhead absorption longward of 2.3  and we too , as for more than half of the nuclear spectra in our sample , find relatively strong stellar absorption features present in the nuclear spectrum suggesting that recent or currently active star formation is an important component of its nuclear energy budget .",
    "eso438-g9 was discovered to be a seyfert galaxy by @xcite , who also noted that it has strong optical feii lines , weak or absent higher ionisation lines ( probably due to the steep fuv spectrum ) , and double absorption features blueward of h@xmath13 and h@xmath28 . in their survey of warm infrared galaxies , @xcite noted that this object had strong broad balmer lines , and that particularly the [ oiii ] line had broad wings .",
    "the r - band image of @xcite shows it to be a spiral galaxy with a very bright unresolved nucleus .",
    "we observe a broad pedestal to the br@xmath4 line with a fwhm of 2000 .",
    "there are also clear stellar absorption features in the nuclear spectrum , indicating a significant contribution to the k - band continuum from late type stars within a few hundred parsecs of the agn .",
    "our spectrum of ngc7469 is similar to that of @xcite , showing fairly deep absorption features as well as both narrow and broad br@xmath4 emission .",
    "although this galaxy is considered to be a proto - typical seyfert  1 , much of the attention it has received is focussed on the circumnuclear ring on scales of @xmath292.5  which is responsible for about half of the galaxy s bolometric luminosity . additionally , about one third of the k - band continuum in the nucleus itself originates in star formation @xcite . comparing the luminosity profile of the 1 - 0s(1 ) line with its dynamics at a resolution of @xmath300.1  ( and also the dynamics of the cold molecular gas at 0.7  resolution ) , @xcite concluded that the very central peak in the 1 - 0s(1 ) emission was not associated with the gas or star forming distributions , and was most likely to originate in gas irradiated by x - rays from the agn .",
    "unfortunately , in a 1  aperture , the 1 - 0s(1 ) flux from this component is expected to contribute only about 2025% of the total 1 - 0s(1 ) flux .",
    "it may not be possible  on seeing limited scales  to resolve the more extended dominant component , that is presumably excited by star formation , from the nuclear point source .",
    "in the previous section we have noted several times that deep stellar absorption features are often present even in the central 100pc around the agn . in this section",
    "we assess the evidence for active star formation in these regions , particularly since this will enable us to place the following discussion of the h@xmath9 excitation mechanisms in context .",
    "high spatial resolution spectroscopy has already provided direct evidence for intense star formation on scales as small as a few tens of parsecs , and even a few parsecs , around several type  1 agn , namely ngc7469 @xcite , mkn231 @xcite , ngc3227 @xcite .",
    "other authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have demonstrated through empirical population synthesis that in about 40% of type  2 seyferts there is recent ( i.e. @xmath301gyr ) star formation within a few hundred parsecs of the nucleus .",
    "it is therefore expedient that we consider whether there could be active and intense star formation in the central apertures of the agn presented here .",
    "[ fig : spat - near ] shows , for each of the five nearer galaxies , the spatial distributions of various quantities along the slit to a projected distance of 1kpc from the centre .",
    "the top panels trace the relative surface brightnesses of the total k - band continuum together with the stellar continuum , 1 - 0s(1 ) and br@xmath4 line emission , the latter two with the same normalisation .",
    "we have attempted to measure only the narrow br@xmath4 . however , in several cases this is difficult to separate from the broad emission ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nuclear - spec - near ] ) and hence over the central arcsec should be taken as a guide only .",
    "the centre panels show the equivalent width of the 2.206  nai stellar absorption line , @xmath31 . to assist in interpreting this ,",
    "we show also the typical range of values ( 23 ) that one would expect it to take .",
    "this is based on results of the stars star formation models @xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ewna ] .",
    "this code calculates the distribution of stars in the hertzsprung - russell diagram as a function of age for an exponentially decaying star formation rate .",
    "using empirically determined @xmath31 from library spectra @xcite , the code then computes the time - dependent @xmath31 for the entire cluster of stars .",
    "the code includes the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars which have a very significant impact on the depth of the absorption features at ages of 0.4 - 2gyr @xcite .",
    "the stellar continuum in the top panel is derived assuming it exhibits a constant equivalent width , which this figure shows to be a reasonable zero - order approximation . finally , the bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : spat - near ] show how the colour of the continuum , defined here as the ratio of the flux densities at 2.19  and 2.25 , varies along the slit .",
    "again , several reference values are superimposed : the range of colours typical of late type stars , and the colour of a blackbody continuum at 1500k representative of hot dust associated with an agn .",
    "extinction is unlikely to change these colours significantly since the relevant quantity is the differential extinction between 2.19 and 2.25 .",
    "this only starts to become important for screen extinction models with @xmath32 .    in general , away from the nucleus itself ,",
    "@xmath31 is consistent with what one expects from the star formation models , indicating that there is little or no dilution .",
    "the nuclear br@xmath4 emission at these radii ( e.g. ngc1097 , ngc1365 ) is indicative of young stars , and the spatial coincidence of 1 - 0s(1 ) emission would suggest that it is a related phenomenon : either from photo - dissociation regions or associated with supernovae . in this sense , the occasional peaks with @xmath33could be due to the stars in individual clusters passing through the late - type supergiant phase at @xmath3410myr .",
    "however , the regions close around the nucleus tell a rather different story .",
    "the stellar continuum appears to increase steeply ; but in every case @xmath31 exhibits a dramatic decrease , which is also associated with a reddening of the continuum colour .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the stellar continuum is strongly diluted by continuum emission from hot dust .",
    "if these features were unresolved , as in ngc1097 , one would immediately assign them to dust heated to 5001500k by the agn .",
    "but more typically , they occur over an extent of 200pc or more and are therefore unlikely to be directly associated with an agn which is expected to heat grains to such high temperatures over rather limited distances  for example the inner edge of a canonical torus on parsec scales or very small grains transiently heated by a jet , as may be occuring in the central few tens of parsecs in ngc1068 @xcite .",
    "agn often exhibit ionisation cones which can extend over distances of hundreds of parsecs , and both ngc1365 and ngc7582 possess one @xcite .",
    "our slits for these two objects are oriented through the ionisation cones .",
    "but over the 5  regions corresponding to the extent of the cones , the respective data sets show totally different properties from each other  suggesting that the observations are not tracing processes associated with the ionisation cones themselves .",
    "in addition , the ionisation cone in ngc4945 @xcite , shows that one would not expect them to produce significant k - band continuum : these authors only see the cone in continuum ( j - band rather than k - band ) because it reduces the extinction to the starlight behind . based on this",
    ", one would expect the cone neither to dilute the stellar features nor to redden the continuum .",
    "we conclude that the agn and its associated phenomena such as ionisation cones are unlikely to produce the combination of properties we observe here .",
    "on the other hand , the reduction in @xmath31 and reddening of the continuum colour are spatially coincident with the brighter stellar continuum , and so  as for the circumnuclear regions further out  could be associated with active star formation .",
    "the approximate coincidence of br@xmath4 emission provides additional circumstantial evidence for a population of very young stars , or at least on - going star formation .",
    "the dilution of the stellar features and reddening of the continuum colour are still most likely attributable to hot dust , although at present one can only make conjectures about the heating source .",
    "it has been suggested that a population of very small grains could be heated to temperatures of 5001000k by young stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , there is little evidence for such a process seen in galactic hii regions . on the other hand , the environment of the region around the agn  in terms of density , pressure , turbulence , energetics , etc .",
    " may be sufficiently different from that of galactic hii regions that it is able to produce a population of sufficiently small grains , as well as drive them near enough to the young stellar clusters so that they can be heated .",
    "one could also envisage other processes which may be at work , such as compton heating by energetic photons from the agn .",
    "however , addressing the issue of the dust heating mechanism is beyond both the data presented here and the scope of this work .",
    "the pertinent issue is that for these extended ( @xmath34200pc ) nuclear regions , one must consider all the observed characteristics together : the line emission , reduction in @xmath31 , reddening of the continuum , and also the brightness of the stellar continuum .",
    "a natural , and arguably the simplest , explanation to account for all these simultaneously is the presence of active star formation , from which the combination of direct emission ( e.g. bright stellar continuum ) and indirect emission ( e.g. recombination lines and plausibly hot dust re - radiation ) can account for what has been observed .",
    "for the h@xmath9 line fluxes listed in table  [ tab : measdat ] and  [ tab : ratios ] , we have calculated the implied molecular column densities , @xmath35 , in the upper rotational - vibrational ( @xmath36 ) levels of the observed transitions , where @xmath37 is the observed flux , @xmath38 is the radiative rate , and @xmath39 is our aperture size .",
    "we assume that the quadrupole transitions are optically thin and we use the radiative @xmath38 values as given by @xcite .",
    "after normalising the population distributions to the @xmath40 level ( i.e. the 1 - 0s(1 ) line ) , we have plotted them as @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the statistical weight ) against energy ( in k ) of each observed @xmath36 level . in such excitation diagrams , the log@xmath43 points for isothermal populations should lie on a straight line .    in order to interpret these diagrams , we consider purely thermal emission as well as a representative set of 5 pdr models which are described by @xcite .",
    "these models consist of static , plane - parallel , semi - infinite clouds that are exposed to isotropic fuv radiation fields @xcite . at each cloud depth",
    "we compute the equilibrium atomic to molecular hydrogen density ratio , @xmath44 , and we solve for the steady - state population densities in the rotational and vibrational h@xmath9 levels in the ground electronic state . in solving for the @xmath36 populations we include the effects of fuv - pumping via the lyman and werner bands , collisional processes with h@xmath45 , h , and h@xmath9 , and quadrupole radiative decays .",
    "the 5 models cover a range of illuminating fuv field intensities @xmath46 , relative to the fuv field in the local interstellar medium ( @xmath47photonss@xmath48m@xmath49 over 9121130 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and total hydrogen particle densities @xmath50 in the clouds . in all of the models except model 1",
    "( for which we keep the temperature constant at @xmath51k ) , we assume that the gas temperature varies with cloud depth and set the temperature at the cloud edge . the gas temperature is a maximum in the outer atomic zone and declines significantly to @xmath52k as the gas becomes molecular , a behaviour that is consistent with both theoretical expectations for , and empirical measurements of , dense pdrs .",
    "the details of the models and a description of their salient features is given by @xcite and are not repeated here .",
    "instead , we summarise the parameters ( @xmath46 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) in table  [ tab : models ] .",
    "the excitation diagrams for the models are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : poplev - model ] , which shows the extent of their coverage of the relative population parameter space .    what is immediately clear from the mean values for the nuclear and circumnuclear spectra , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : poplev - mean ] ( where the error bars denote the standard devation of the values among the objects ) , as well as from the individual values is that the @xmath55 levels are well thermalised . in every case",
    "these levels can be reproduced by an isothermal cloud at 1300k .",
    "however it is not possible to say from just the @xmath55 levels whether the h@xmath9 molecules have been excited by a thermal process such as a shock front , or whether it is due to high gas density regardless of the mechanism which provides the energy .",
    "the higher levels suggest the latter since in every case they lie above the prediction for 1300k . to compensate for this",
    ", one would need either multiple thermal components , or a fluorescent component .",
    "the former is not a satisfactory solution because the temperature needed  about 3000k between the @xmath55 and @xmath56 levels , and of order 5000k between the @xmath56 and @xmath57 levels  would mean that the molecules are rapidly dissociated .",
    "the possibility that instead a fluorescent excitation mechanism is responsible for the @xmath56 and @xmath57 populations is given by the blue symbols in the figures , which represent our pdr model  2 .",
    "in this model , the @xmath55 levels are collisionally thermalised as a result of the high @xmath58@xmath59 gas density .",
    "in addition , the model exhibits a shift in the ortho - para ratio for the @xmath56 levels : the @xmath60 para level is above the adjacent @xmath61 and @xmath62 ortho levels .",
    "suppression of the ortho - para ratio below the value of 3 obtained in local thermal equilibrium in warm gas is a typical signature of excitation by fuv pumping . it occurs because the ortho uv absorption lines have a higher optical depth , and hence the vibrationally pumped ortho - h@xmath9 is suppressed with respect to para - h@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it is exactly this effect that can be seen in the h@xmath9 population diagrams of the agn for which all 3 relevant lines have been detected , both in the nuclear and circumnuclear regions .    of the 5 pdr models we consider  covering the parameter space fuv intensity @xmath63-@xmath64 times that in the local interstellar medium , gas density @xmath65-@xmath66@xmath59 , and temperature @xmath67-@xmath68k  it is model 2 and 4 ( differing only in fuv intensity , and indistinguishable in terms of their resulting line ratios ) which best match the data .",
    "this indicates that the maximum temperature is @xmath12k ( as one would expect from the @xmath55 levels discussed above ) , the gas density is of order @xmath69@xmath59 , and the incident fuv intensity is at least @xmath70 times the local ambient value .",
    "model 2 provides a reasonable match to all the data in the mean diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : poplev - mean ] ) , and is the model we use as a reference when considering the individual objects , the excitation diagrams for which are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : poplev - near ] and  [ fig : poplev - far ] .      in all of the five galaxies belonging to the nearby sample",
    ", the circumnuclear line ratios can be reproduced by model 2  and in the case of ngc2992 the match is remarkably good .",
    "there are a few isolated cases where line limits appear to be inconsistent with the model , but in at least some cases these limits appear to be unphysical : for example , in none of our models is the @xmath71 less than the @xmath72 and @xmath73 levels . in this case",
    "the 2 - 1(2 ) line is significantly weaker than 2 - 1s(1 ) and 2 - 1s(3 ) due to its smaller statistical weight and occurs in the overlap region of the two spectral segments where small uncertainties in scaling the two segments can have a disproportionate effect that is not reflected in the estimation of the line flux uncertainty .",
    "similarly , the @xmath74 level is derived from the 3 - 2s(3 ) line which sits close to the edge of the 2.206  na absorption which can often be quite deep .",
    "a description of how the uncertainties were estimated is given in section  [ sec : contfit ] , but any such estimate can not take into account systematic errors such as incorrect removal of the continuum features due to mismatch of the stellar templates . bearing this in mind , one should be cautious of the uncertainties when a weak line or non - detection occurs close to a region of strong stellar absorption , and not over - interpret them when assessing the correspondance between model and data .",
    "the conclusion that in all five cases the h@xmath9 lines appear to be excited in dense pdrs exposed to high fuv fields is consistent with what one might expect of regions efficiently forming massive young stars at a high rate .",
    "the data for the nuclear line fluxes is much less complete , primarily due to the greatly increased noise in the spectrum from the bright hot dust continuum associated with the agn . nevertheless , in three of the four nearby galaxies where h@xmath9 lines are detected ",
    "namely ngc1097 , ngc2992 , and ngc5506  their ratios show a strong similarity to those of the circumnuclear regions , with the single exception of the @xmath75 level in ngc1097 which is a factor of @xmath342 less than one would expect .",
    "the fourth galaxy , ngc7582 , is similar for all the levels up to and including @xmath72 , but the @xmath74 level is significantly higher than one would expect : none of our pdr models can reproduce this .",
    "examination of the region around the 3 - 2s(3 ) line at 2.2  in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuclear - spec - far ] suggests that in ngc7582 it also seems likely that template mismatch and hence incomplete correction of the absorption features in the stellar continuum has led to poor estimation of the weak line flux .    in none of these galaxies",
    "do we find evidence for suppression of the 2 - 1s(3 ) line , which might be expected for agn if the gas irradiated by x - rays .",
    "this is a theoretical possibility if there is an excess of ly@xmath13 photons , due to an accidental resonance between the 1 - 2p(5 ) and 1 - 2r(6 ) transitions and the ly@xmath13 line @xcite .",
    "an excess of ly@xmath13 photons will depopulate the lower ( i.e. @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) levels , resulting in a reduction in the two 2 - 1s(3 ) and 2 - 1s(4 ) line strengths .",
    "such a situation could arise in x - ray irradiated gas , in which the primary photoelectrons have high enough energies to generate many more secondary ionisations ( @xmath78 per kev of primary photoelectron energy ; @xcite ) through collisional excitation .",
    "it has been proposed by @xcite as the explanation for a previously reported weakness of that line in ngc6240 . however , using higher resolution and signal - to - noise spectra , @xcite showed that this line is in fact not suppressed , and that the @xmath550 and 21 transitions can be well matched by models of isothermal emission .",
    "a second case is ngc1275 , which has very luminous h@xmath9 emission ( @xmath79 ) mostly concentrated in a compact ( @xmath340.5 ) nuclear source @xcite . interpreting the line ratios in terms of thermal excitation with two or more excitation temperatures",
    ", @xcite argued that the flux of the 2 - 1s(3 ) line was a factor of at least 2.5 less than expected and attributed this to the fact that the excitation of the gas is dominated by x - ray heating from the agn .",
    "we plot the data for the central 3  of ngc1275 ( from their table  2 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : poplev-1275 ] .",
    "it is clear that these data tend towards the same trend we have seen in our seyfert nuclei : the @xmath1 transitions appear thermalised while the higher vibrational transitions indicate an additional higher temperature thermal or fluorescent ( pdr ) component .",
    "the levels from our pdr model  2 ( overplotted as squares ) go some way to explaining the observed ratios and the apparent weakness of the ( 2,5 ) level .",
    "a pdr model with low density fluorescence ( our model  1 ; overplotted as triangles ) , matches the @xmath7 and @xmath3 levels extremely well if it is scaled to produce 1/3 of the total 1 - 0s(1 ) flux .",
    "it does not reproduce the @xmath80 levels at all ; but it is not unreasonable to suppose that in such a large aperture ( 3  is equivalent to 1kpc ) there may be multiple excitation processes at work and that the @xmath81 levels could arise from a region where thermal processes dominate and the higher levels from a region where non - thermal processes dominate .    in the nuclear specta of our agn ,",
    "the line ratios are , as for the circumnuclear regions , consistent with excitation by intense star formation in relatively dense pdrs .",
    "this appears to be the case even for ngc5506 which has a very luminous seyfert nucleus . on the other hand ,",
    "determining whether the data are consistent with x - ray excitation is not straightforward .",
    "from their models of x - ray irradiated gas , both @xcite and @xcite conclude that the 2 - 1s(1 ) to 1 - 0s(1 ) ratio should nearly always be @xmath82 ; most of the diagnostic power of these models appear to lie in transitions from @xmath83 or far infrared lines from other species .",
    "instead we consider the 210kev hard x - ray fluxes , which are listed in table  [ tab : measdat ] .",
    "these indicate that , as also found by @xcite , there is absolutely no correlation between x - ray and h@xmath9 emission",
    ". this could be either because the two are not causally related , implying a different excitation mechanism for the h@xmath9 ; or due to the different timescales for variability .",
    "the hard x - ray luminosities are known to vary on fast timescales ",
    "e.g. by a factor of 2 over a period of a few hours for ngc1365 @xcite and ngc7469 @xcite  while the h@xmath9 emission would only vary on the far longer timescales associated with its physical extent ( @xmath84pc implies @xmath34300yrs ) .    for ngc1097 nuclear h@xmath9 excitation by star formation rather than an agn can be understood because the agn is in general rather low luminosity ( see section  [ sec : notes ] ) . and in ngc1097 , ngc2992 , and ngc7582 fig .",
    "[ fig : nuclear - spec - far ] indicates that the nai stellar absorption is clearly visible despite ( in the latter 2 cases ) strong dilution by the agn . as discussed in section  [ sec : starform ] , this suggests that in these cases there may be significant active star formation in the nucleus and as a result any h@xmath9 emission from x - ray excited gas could be hidden by emission from pdrs excited by the young stars .",
    "of the four more distant galaxies , h@xmath9 emission was detected in three ",
    "namely ngc1194 , ngc7469 , and eso438-g9  but the data is sparser still than the nearby ones . beyond the statement that the @xmath55 levels are thermalised but the higher levels indicate fluorescent excitation , there is little that we can conclude",
    "this in itself suggests that the @xmath55 levels are thermalised due to high gas density rather than purely thermal excitation in shocks , consistent with the results for the nearby galaxies . that the excitation could be due to active star formation is evidenced by the nai absorption which can be seen in these three nuclei despite the agn dilution",
    "however , we can make no statement on whether the gas is also ( or instead ) being irradiated by x - rays from the agn . in ngc7469 the low populations in the @xmath72 and @xmath73 levels hint that perhaps even the @xmath56 levels are partially thermalised ",
    "i.e. that the gas density may be as high as @xmath85@xmath59 as in model 5 , which better reproduces these lower populations",
    ". given the extremely large cold molecular gas mass in the nuclear region of this galaxy , inferred from co2 - 1 observations @xcite , very high gas densities in the clouds themselves are to be expected .",
    "we have presented k - band spectra of the central regions of nine agn , for five of which we also present circumnuclear spectra . in these spectra , we have measured h@xmath9 emission line fluxes from the @xmath86 , 2 , and 3 levels .",
    "we performed two critical steps which enabled us to significantly increase our sensitivity to the weak lines : the first is to fit the continuum with stellar templates , allowing us to remove the absorption features ; the second is to de - rotate the spectra , decorrelating noise from imperfect telluric correction while simultaneously correlating signal from the emission lines .",
    "broad br@xmath4 ( i.e. fwhm @xmath87 ) is observed in seven of the nine nuclear spectra .",
    "we conclude the following :    1 .",
    "use of the ratios of the @xmath55 - 0 transitions , either between themselves or with other lines such as br@xmath4 , h@xmath13 , or [ oi]@xmath88  can be misleading since in starburst and agn environments , these levels are often ( and perhaps almost always ) thermalised without necessarily implying shock excitation .",
    "indeed , we have shown strong evidence that fluorescent excitation plays a major role in the h@xmath9 excitation .",
    "the h@xmath9 line ratios in the circumnuclear regions are very similar in all cases .",
    "while the @xmath55 levels are thermalised at @xmath341000k , fuv - pumped gas is needed to account for the higher levels , consistent with emission from high density pdrs . in our pdr models , the typical parameters that best account for the observed line fluxes are gas density @xmath89@xmath59 , temperature at the outer edge of the clouds @xmath6k , and illuminating fuv fields @xmath90 times more intense than the local interstellar field .",
    "these parameters are similar to those found for the nuclei of ulirgs by @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath9 line ratios in the nuclear regions are also similar in that the @xmath55 levels are thermalised at @xmath341000k but the higher levels require fuv pumping .",
    "the observed line ratios can be accounted for by h@xmath9 excitation occupying a similar parameter space to that found for the pdrs in the circumnuclear regions , suggesting that the mechanism dominating the nuclear h@xmath9 emission could be illumination of pdrs by intense young star formation .",
    "we find no evidence for suppression of the 2 - 1s(3 ) line , which may occur in x - ray irradiated gas .",
    "we suggest that even in the case of ngc1275 @xcite , the h@xmath9 line ratios can be explained without recourse to such a phenomenon .",
    "this does not mean that such suppression does not occur  simply that on scales of @xmath84pc , x - ray heating is probably not the dominant excitation mechanism .",
    "5 .   despite strong dilution by a red continuum , probably associated with hot dust grains , stellar nai absorption at 2.206",

    "<S> we report @xmath0 very large telescope isaac k - band spectroscopy of the nuclei ( i.e. central 100300pc ) of nine galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus . for five of these </S>",
    "<S> we also present spectra of the circumnuclear region out to 1kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we have measured a number of molecular hydrogen lines in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 vibrational transitions , as well as the br@xmath4 and hei recombination lines , and the nai stellar absorption feature . </S>",
    "<S> although only three of the galaxies are classified as type  1 seyferts in the literature , broad br@xmath4 ( fwhm @xmath51000 ) is seen in seven of the objects . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 emission appears thermalised at temperatures @xmath6k . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath7 and @xmath8 emission show evidence of being radiatively excited by far - ultraviolet photons . </S>",
    "<S> the photo - dissociation region models that fit the data best are , as for the ultraluminous infrared galaxies in @xcite , those for which the h@xmath9 emission arises in dense clouds illuminated by intense fuv radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the nai stellar absorption line is clearly seen in six of the nuclear spectra of these agn , indicating the presence of a significant population of late type stars . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that these stars are a result of the same episode of star formation that gave rise to the stars heating the pdrs . </S>",
    "<S> it seems unlikely that the agn is the dominant source of excitation for the near infrared h@xmath9 emission : in two of the nuclear spectra h@xmath9 was not detected at all , and in general we find no evidence of suppression of the 2 - 1s(3 ) line , which may occur in x - ray irradiated gas . </S>",
    "<S> our data do not reveal any significant difference between the nuclear and circumnuclear line ratios , suggesting that the physical conditions of the dominant excitation mechanism are similar both near the agn and in the larger scale environment around it , and that star formation is an important process even in the central 100pc acround agn . </S>"
