    "this indicates that hadron interaction at very small distances is strongly repulsive .    on other hand ,",
    "the physics of neutron stars radii also improved in this decade .",
    "recent observations indicate that the radii of pulsars of mass around the canonical 1.4@xmath1 are lower than most of the previsions found in the literature @xcite .",
    "today we know that the radius of the neutron stars are somehow related to the symmetry energy slope , @xmath2  @xcite , although @xmath2 can not be the ultimate information about neutron stars radii , once the same model with the same slope , predicts neutron stars whose difference in radius reaches 1.7 km  @xcite .",

    "we show that the onset of a new degree of freedom , not only causes the known softening of the eos but also reduces the radii of the stars whose central density is higher than the density of the hyperon threshold ( what we call here subsequent stars ) , when compared with the eos without this new degree of freedom .",
    "we use here the @xmath7 hyperon as this new degree of freedom , once it is the lowest mass baryon beyond the nucleons .",
    "nevertheless it is important to bear in mind that the nature of the new degree of freedom is not relevant .",
    "similar results can be obtained using @xmath8 or @xmath9 hyperons , or even @xmath10 resonances , by adjusting the strength of the coupling constant for those particles .",
    "even more exotic particles , as dark matter  @xcite can be used without significantly affect the results .",
    "we show that if the hyperon onset happens at relatively low density , and a channel , repulsive enough , as the strange vector @xmath0 meson is added , we can produce very massive and compact neutron stars in agreement with the works above mentioned . moreover ,",
    "if an attractive channel , as the strange scalar @xmath11 meson is also added , we can produce even more compact neutron stars . indeed , we are able to simulate an eos that predicts 2.05 @xmath1 as maximum mass with a radius of 11.51 km for the canonical 1.4@xmath1 .",

    "parameters of the model and previsions . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     now , lets solve the tov equations and obtain the mass - radius relation . the results are plotted in fig  [ f13 ] and the main relevant properties are resumed in tab .",
    "the presence of the @xmath11 softens the eos at low densities .",
    "this behavior causes the  turn to the left \" in mass - radius relation to be more pronounced , compressing the subsequent neutron stars and producing a significantly lower value for the radius of the 1.4@xmath1 star .",
    "the stronger the @xmath35 coupling , the lower the radius .",
    "indeed this radius can reach 11.51 km for a very strong @xmath35 coupling constant , of two times the @xmath36 one .",
    "this limit of two times the @xmath36 one presented in this work is not arbitrary .",
    "this is the highest value that produces a neutron star of 2.05@xmath1 with @xmath37 always greater than zero .",
    "if we increase the @xmath35 coupling , this condition will be broken . of course we can increase the @xmath38 coupling constant to avoid a negative value of @xmath37",
    ", however it will also increase the maximum max beyond 2.05@xmath1 and enlarge the radius of the canonical star . with the help of @xmath11 meson we are able to simulate neutron stars agreeing with the psr j0348 + 0432  @xcite , and the radii in the range proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . comparing the tov solution with the eos of fig .",
    "[ f12 ] we can also link the radius of canonical stars to a soft eos at densities not much above the saturation point . this seems a more fundamental relation than linking the radii to the slope .",
    "the cause and effect follows : the hyperon onset softs the eos ( at low densities ) , and this soft eos produces the `` turn to the left '' in the mass - radius relation .",
    "the strong @xmath38 coupling produces a stiff eos ( at high densities ) , and this stiff eos produces very massive neutron stars .    to conclude this section we compare our results for a symmetric hypernuclear matter with the constrain imposed by ref .",
    "again , due to the fact that the eos are very similar we plot only set h - v and set h - viii",
    ". since set h - vi and h - vii have intermediate values for the coupling constants , their results will be always between sets h - v and h - viii .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ f14 ] that the same effects that happen in @xmath39-equilibrium matter are reproduced in symmetric hypernuclear matter .",
    "the stronger the @xmath35 coupling , the softer the eos . but due to the high value of the @xmath38 coupling needed to reproduce very massive pulsars , this eos will become stiffer at high densities .",
    "we conclude that our model with the onset of a new degree of freedom agrees with astrophysical observations and hic experiments .",
    "in this work we show how the onset of a new degree of freedom is able to reconcile the recent measurements of very massive pulsars  @xcite with compact ones  @xcite , and also satisfy hic experimental constraints  @xcite .",
    "although the true nature of this new degree of freedom is an open puzzle , we show that a particle not much heavier than the nucleon and a new repulsive channel is enough to accomplish this goal .",
    "also , we are able to construct a thermodynamical consistent model with no @xmath40 inputs .    we start by reviewing the effects of hyperon threshold in dense nuclear matter .",
    "the consequent softening of the eos and reduction of the maximum mass is a well - known theme in the literature  @xcite , but the  turn to be left \" when the hyperon fraction becomes relevant seems to have passed unnoticed .",
    "we show that for the well - established @xmath7 potential depth of -28 mev , there is little influence of the hyperon onset in the radii of stars around the canonical mass of 1.4@xmath1 .",
    "next we modify the @xmath7 potential depth allowing it to assume more attractive values .",
    "therefore , the onset of the new degree of freedom appears at lower densities and the  turn to be left \" occurss for less massive stars , reaching the canonical mass .",
    "due to the very weak repulsive channel , all resulting neutron stars have very low maximum mass and the corresponding eos must be ruled out .    to overcome this issue",
    "we add a new repulsive channel , through the strange vector @xmath0 meson .",
    "this allows us to stiffen the eos and increase the maximum mass without change any properties of nuclear matter and with no effect on the hyperon threshold .",
    "this also allows us to construct a very realistic eos , that is able to explain the massive psr j0348 + 0432 and the measurements of low radii pulsars .",
    "the result is even better when compared with the results of hic .",
    "now we are able to reconcile astrophysical observation and lab constraints .    in the last part of our work we add a new attractive channel , the strange scalar @xmath11 meson .",
    "this new attractive field softens the eos at low densities , making the  turn to be left \" more pronounced .",
    "this compresses even more the subsequent stars , allowing us to construct an eos that predicts a maximum mass of 2.05@xmath1 , while the canonical 1.4@xmath1 has a radius of only 11.51 km .",
    "we are also able to link the low radius to a soft eos at low densities , what seems a more fundamental reason than relating it to the symmetry energy slope .",
    "moreover , the emergence of a new degree of freedom again reconciles this eos with hic experiments .",
    "we finish this work by pointing out that the nature of the new degree of freedom needs to be better studied , but it seems that the eos needs to be soft at low densities to predict very compact neutron stars . however , the radii of canonical neutron stars is not a closed subject .",
    "some studies indicate that their values could be very low , not surpassing 11.1 km  @xcite , close but still below the 11.51 km found in this work .",
    "nevertheless , since it is still an open puzzle , a relatively large @xmath41 limit of 10.7 km for the canonical neutron star is presented in ref .",
