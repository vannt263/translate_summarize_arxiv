    "finding the capacity of relay networks is a basic open problem in network information theory @xcite .",
    "one way to approximate the function of relay networks is through deterministic models that was first introduced by aref @xcite .",
    "avestimehr , diggavi and tse have recently @xcite introduced a linear deterministic model for wireless relay networks that treats noise as a deterministic thresholding function and the interference of signals as a linear transformation over a finite field .",
    "they have successfully applied this model to several relay networks and have shown that the capacity of the deterministic model is within a constant gap from the corresponding wireless network .",
    "furthermore , they have shown that a max  flow min  cut result holds for the capacity of the relay deterministic network in the case of a single multicast session . while the capacity achieving scheme in @xcite",
    "is a random coding over long blocks of signals , recent works @xcite have devised low complexity and deterministic schemes that achieves the maximum capacity in the case of a unicast session .    in the case of multiple messages , mohajer et al .",
    ", @xcite have considered two unicast sessions on a relay network with two relays , two sources , and two destinations .",
    "they study two special cases of this setting , namely zs and zz channels and give a full characterization of the capacity region along with capacity acheiving schemes in each case .    in this paper",
    ", we are also interested in the deterministic relay network with interference at each node .",
    "the network here consists of a source node , a destination node , and two relay nodes .",
    "additionally there is a disturbing node that sends signals to the two relays and causes interference with message signals .",
    "our goal is to characterize the capacity region from source to destination in the presense of the disturbing node .",
    "our model differs from the model in @xcite in two ways .",
    "first they consider a two dimensional capacity region in which each source node tryes to send messages to its designated destination .",
    "but in our model , we only try to find the one dimensional capacity from one source to the corresponding destination . on the other hand , while in both the zs and zz channels the interference of the two messages only occur in one relay node , in our model we assume that the disturbing signals have interference with both relays which makes it more difficult to handle .",
    "we find the capacity and offer capacity achieving schemes that have low complexities for this relaying problem .",
    "the organization of the material in this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the deterministic model of relay networks and the model of the network that we study in this paper .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the general linear coding and decoding strategies and the achievable rate of the linear schemes . in section iii",
    "we find optimal linear coding schemes and their corresponding achievable rates .",
    "first we briefly state the linear deterministic model of relay networks from @xcite , then we introduce our considered network model .      consider a directed graph @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the set of nodes in the network including source , relays and destination and @xmath2 is the set of edges .",
    "communication from node @xmath3 to @xmath4 has a nonnegative gain @xmath5 associated with it .",
    "this number models the channel gain in the corresponding gaussian setting .",
    "each node @xmath3 transmits a vector @xmath6 and receives a vector @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "the received signal at each node is a deterministic function of transmitted signals at the other nodes with the following input ",
    "output relation : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the @xmath11 shift matrix given by@xmath12 in this paper , we are interested in linear coding schemes where at every node @xmath4 the transmitted signal is a linear function of the received signal    @xmath13    the goal is to design coding functions @xmath14 such that the destination node receives enough information for decoding the message sent by the source .",
    "diamond network with a disturbing node ]    we consider a diamond relay network with a disturbing node which is depicted in figure [ fig : diamond - network - with ] . here",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the source and the destination nodes and @xmath17 is the source of disturbing signals .",
    "also nodes @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the relay nodes . for simplicity of our analysis",
    "we assume that the links from @xmath17 to the two relays have the same gain @xmath20 that is also realistic in the situation where the distance between the nodes in the diamond wireless network is relatively small compared to the distance from node @xmath17 which might be operating in a different network . as before , we denote the transmitted signal from node @xmath3 by @xmath21 and the received signal by @xmath22    let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be the coding matrices at nodes @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the signal @xmath25 received by destination is a linear combination of the transmitted signals @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 where by application of ( [ eq : linear_relation ] ) we have @xmath29 for every choice of @xmath23 and @xmath24 we let @xmath30 denote the rate of transmission of information from @xmath15 to @xmath31 also we let @xmath32 denote the capacity of transmission from @xmath15 to @xmath16 . in the following , we explicitly find @xmath33 and in the next section",
    "we find the capacity @xmath34 in terms of the network parameters .    in our analysis",
    ", we usually work with the range and dimension of matrices . for matrix",
    "@xmath35 we let @xmath36 denote the linear span of the columns of @xmath35 . also for a subspace @xmath37 we let @xmath38 denote its dimension .",
    "obviousely @xmath39 for two matrices @xmath40 we also use the shorthand @xmath41 to denote @xmath42    [ thm : rate]for any choice of @xmath23 and @xmath24 we have@xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are defined in ( [ eq : g_s ] ) and ( [ eq : g_m ] ) .    for two subspaces @xmath46 and @xmath47 of @xmath48 , let @xmath49 . to prove the theorem [ thm : rate ] we first prove the following lemma .",
    "[ lem : subspaces]if @xmath46 and @xmath47 are two subspaces of @xmath48 then for any @xmath50 there exists a unique pair @xmath51 and @xmath52 with @xmath53 if and only if @xmath54    first suppose that @xmath55 hence , there exists at last @xmath56 such that @xmath57 then if @xmath58 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we also have @xmath59 and @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "therefore the condition is necessary . to prove the sufficiency",
    ", we notice that @xmath62 is a subspace of @xmath48 and if @xmath63 we can form a basis for @xmath62 by union of a basis of @xmath46 and a basis of @xmath64 now if @xmath65 and @xmath66 we can form two different expansions for @xmath67 in the basis of @xmath62 by using either the expansion of @xmath68and @xmath69 in the bases of @xmath46 and @xmath47 or the expansions of @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the bases of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this contradicts the fact that each @xmath72 has a unique expansion in the basis of @xmath62 .",
    "next we prove theorem [ thm : rate ] .",
    "for a linear scheme we choose a subspace @xmath73 as the set of our codewords @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath74 for a successful decoding @xmath75 has to satisfy two properties ; first , each @xmath76 should be mapped into a unique vector in @xmath62 .",
    "this implies that @xmath77 second , for every @xmath78 and every @xmath79 @xmath80 corresponds to the unique pair of @xmath81 and @xmath82 these two conditions guarantee that each @xmath25 corresponds to a unique codeword @xmath83 then , the maximum dimension of @xmath75 that satisfies the two conditions is the rate @xmath84 of the code .",
    "since @xmath85 can be any vector in @xmath86 to satisfy the second condition , by lemma [ lem : subspaces ] , @xmath87 @xmath62 has the maximum dimension when it is the largest subspace of the set @xmath88 which has a dimension of @xmath89 next we choose @xmath75 to be the subspace of @xmath48 with dimension of @xmath90 such that @xmath44 maps it to the set @xmath91 notice that since @xmath62 is a subspace of @xmath92 we can always find such @xmath93 therefore @xmath94",
    "in this section , we find the linear capacity of the network , that is the maximum achievable rate by a linear coding scheme . in several steps of our capacity calculation we will use the following useful lemma :    [ lem : f_and_g]let @xmath95 and @xmath96 be two matrices that are the same in at least their first @xmath97 rows . then    @xmath98    let @xmath99 $ ] and @xmath100 $ ] where @xmath18 is a @xmath101 matrix .",
