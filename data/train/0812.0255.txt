    "exact solutions of 1-dimensional ( 1d ) many particle stochastic models schutz review have given much insight into the physics of non - equilibrium systems in one dimension @xcite .",
    "they serve as a testing ground for the macroscopic theories , being able to verify their predictions bertini .",
    "examples are the description of different kinds of non - equilibrium phase transitions@xcite , calculation of the large deviation functions for the density profile and total particle currentderrida , verification of the fluctuation dissipation relations lebowitz spohn and testing of the range of their validity @xcite .",
    "the range of models is very broad . in the context of the present article we mention two of them .",
    "the first one is the lock step model of vicious walkers ( vw ) that has been introduced in the physical literature by m. fisher fisher to describe the wetting and melting phenomena .",
    "this is a random process defined as many _ non - interacting _",
    "particles performing random walks on a 1d lattice , whose space - time trajectories are forbidden to cross each other .",
    "the term non - interacting means that the probability of a particular realization of the process , which meets the latter constraint , is  given by the product of the probabilities of the random walks performed by each individual walker .",
    "the other realizations , where crossings occur , are assigned zero statistical weight .",
    "such an elimination of a fraction of possible outcomes at every time step violates the probability conservation .",
    "a measure of the probability dissipation is the sum of the probabilities of all possible particle configurations at a given time , referred to as the survival probability .",
    "its leading asymptotics for @xmath0 particles has been shown by m. fisher to decay with time @xmath5 as a power law : @xmath6 .",
    "another model , the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) ligget , has been widely discussed in connection to the kardar - parisi - zhang universality class @xcite . in contrast to the vw model , this is a model of _ interacting _ random walks .",
    "the interaction prevents particles from jumping to occupied sites .",
    "therefore , similarly to vicious walkers , the statistical ensemble includes only those events in which the space - time trajectories of particles do not cross .",
    "the difference is that there is an interaction that changes the statistical weights of particle trajectories when they pass via neighboring sites so that the total probability is conserved . in this case",
    "the quantity corresponding to the survival probability is just a probability normalization constant .",
    "thus , the probability lost after imposing the global non - crossing constraint on the dynamics of non - interacting particles in vw is regained in the tasep by adding the lacking probability locally at certain steps . in the present paper we consider the two models as limiting cases of a more general interaction , where the added probability is a varying parameter of the model that controls the probability dissipation , such that the probability conservation is restored when it is tuned to the tasep value . in this connection",
    "a natural question arises : what happens with fisher s asymptotics for the survival probability under such a generalization and , in particular , how does it cross over to the tasep normalization constant .",
    "this is the first question we address in this paper .",
    "specifically , we propose a semi - vicious walkers ( svw ) model , which interpolates between vw and tasep .",
    "it is a model of interacting particles with partial repulsion or attraction , where trajectory crossings are forbidden .",
    "the term partial repulsion ( attraction ) means that the probability for the particle to jump to an occupied site is not equal to zero like in tasep but can be less ( greater ) than that of a free particle . at the same time , the non - crossing constraint leads to lack of probability conservation in the same way as in the vw model .",
    "the strength of the interaction , which also characterizes the probability dissipation , is a parameter of the model , which has the tasep and vw as limiting cases at the endpoints of its range .    in this article",
    "we obtain the large - time asymptotics of the survival probability .",
    "its limiting case corresponding to vw is given by the above mentioned result of fisher , which yields the leading power law asymptotics .",
    "later it was reproduced with more mathematical rigor together with the constant prefactor that was obtained for the particular initial configurations , where the particles are separated by equal spaces krattenhaler guttman viennot . in the case of a general initial configuration of walkers",
    "this prefactor depends on the initial positions .",
    "this case has been studied in @xcite .",
    "our results can be roughly divided into two parts . for generic values of the interaction strength , away from the point corresponding to the tasep",
    ", the probability dissipation is finite .",
    "it is intuitively clear that the main asymptotics must be similar to the vw one .",
    "indeed , we obtain the fisher s power law with a constant prefactor that depends on the initial positions of the particles and on the interaction strength . it is shown to diverge in the tasep limit .",
    "the second and probably the most interesting case is the transition region , which interpolates between the vw and tasep behavior . to probe into this region",
    ", we consider a scaling limit of the survival probability , where the large time limit and the tasep limit of the interaction strength are combined . in this way",
    "we obtain a scaling function of a single parameter that controls the transition from vw to tasep .",
    "the second problem we address is the distribution of the integral particle current in tasep .",
    "a first example of such an exact distribution has been obtained by derrida and lebowitz @xcite , who found the large deviation function for the particle current in the tasep confined to a ring .",
    "a specific property of the finite system is that there is a finite relaxation time , after which the system settles into a non - equilibrium stationary state , independent of initial conditions @xcite .",
    "then , the tool used to study integral current fluctuations is , roughly speaking , an analysis of the relaxation of the system subject to a perturbation into the stationary state .",
    "technically it is an analysis of the largest eigenvalue of the perturbed markov matrix governing the process .    in genuinely infinite systems",
    "the situation is more peculiar . in this case",
    "there is no characteristic relaxation time scale . when starting away from the stationary state , the latter is never approached . in this case",
    "one needs to consider actual time evolution of quantities of interest , which depend on initial conditions .",
    "a major breakthrough in this direction has been achieved by johansson , @xcite .",
    "he considered the tasep evolution of an infinite cluster of particles , which initially occupies all sites of the lattice to the left of a fixed site , and calculated the distribution of the number of steps made by an arbitrary particle in this cluster .",
    "johansson s solution has initiated a burst of activity in the field , which exploited deep connections of the tasep to the theory of random matrix ensembles and the determinantal point processes .",
    "results have been obtained for different initial conditions and extended to many particle joint distributions sasamoto nagao,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , .",
    "remarkably , in the scaling limit these results provide parameter free universal distributions @xcite of the fluctuations measured in the kpz characteristic scale , which is of order of @xmath7 as time @xmath5 grows to infinity @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the diffusive scale @xmath8 , which , according to the central limit theorem ( clt ) , characterizes the fluctuations of the distance travelled by a free particle @xcite .",
    "the large deviation limit of the single particle current distribution has been studied in @xcite in connection with the fluctuation dissipation relations .    despite the great success in finding the distributions of single particle currents and their correlation functions , very few results on the integral particle current , i.e. on the distance travelled by all particles , are available for driven diffusive systems .",
    "in fact the only known exact result is the above mentioned large deviation function for the integral particle current for the tasep in a ring @xcite and its generalization for the partially asymmetric case @xcite , @xcite .",
    "no results beyond the large deviation scale , neither a generalization for an infinite system has been proposed . on the other hand ,",
    "extensive quantities like the integral current , are important ingredients of the thermodynamics of the models .",
    "a knowledge of the character of their fluctuations could be of help for extension of the thermodynamical formalism to irreversible systems .",
    "the present paper makes a step in this direction .",
    "the problem we solve here is as follows .",
    "we study the large time asymptotics of the distribution of the total number of jumps made by a finite number of tasep particles in an infinite lattice , given an arbitrary initial configuration .",
    "the idea that allows us to consider this problem in line with the previous one is the existence of a kind of fluctuation - dissipation relation that unifies the dissipation of probability in svw and the statistics of fluctuations of the integrated particle current in tasep .",
    "specifically , an auxiliary parameter , which violates the probability conservation , can be introduced into the evolution operator in tasep to account for the total number of steps made by particles , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this parameter plays a role similar to the one played by the interaction in svw , the two problems being equivalent after a certain change of variables . using this fact",
    ", we interpret the result obtained for the survival probability in svw as a generating function of the particle current in tasep .",
    "the latter , in its turn , can be used to reconstruct the form of the current distribution .    like those for svw , the results obtained for the tasep particle current consist of two parts .",
    "the generic values of the interaction strength correspond to the distribution of the particle current at the large deviation scale , i.e. describes the deviations of order of time @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that it has a skew distribution with asymmetric negative and positive tails .",
    "these tails are connected by a middle part corresponding to the transition region . the latter yields the current distribution at the diffusive scale , @xmath8 , which is shown to have a skew non - gaussian form , depending only on the total number of particles , and we suggest to be universal for particles performing a driven diffusion .",
    "one technical remark has to be made about the connection of our solution to the theory of random matrix ensembles .",
    "it is this connection which  enabled the above mentioned progress in calculating the single particle current distributions and their many particle generalizations . in our solution",
    "this connection has also been exploited .",
    "namely , the survival probability in the svw model at generic values of the interaction strength and exactly at the tasep point can be calculated in terms the mehta integrals @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which appear as normalization factors in the orthogonal and unitary gaussian ensembles of random matrices respectively @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the scaling function obtained in the transition region for the system of @xmath0 particles can be reduced to neither of these integrals except of at three limiting points , where it becomes @xmath12,@xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "thus , we obtain a generalized object , which interpolates between these three mehta integrals , and , therefore , in a sense unifies three different matrix ensembles . to our knowledge",
    "no such generalization has appeared in the theory before .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we formulate the svw model , state the results obtained and discuss their interpretation in terms of the probability distribution of the particle current in tasep .",
    "sections 3 - 5 are a technical part , where we prove the results outlined in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we solve the master equation for the svw model .",
    "in section 4 we obtain the asymptotic formulas for the transition probabilities . in section 5",
    "we prove the limiting properties of the function characterizing the svw to tasep transition .",
    "section 6 has a summary and conclusions .",
    "consider @xmath0 particles on a 1d infinite lattice .",
    "a configuration @xmath15 of the system is specified by an @xmath0-tuple of strictly increasing integers@xmath16where @xmath17 is the coordinate of @xmath18-th particle .",
    "the strictly increasing order reflects the exclusion condition , i.e. two particles can not occupy the same site .",
    "we say that the relation @xmath19  holds for particle configurations if@xmath20the svw model is a random process , which is defined on a set of sequences of configurations @xmath21 such that @xmath22we refer to such a sequence as a trajectory of the system traveled up to time @xmath5 .",
    "every such trajectory is realized with probability @xmath23@xmath24 is the initial probability of the configuration @xmath15 and the transition probability @xmath25 from the configuration @xmath26 to @xmath27 is defined as follows@xmath28where @xmath29and@xmath30this means that at each discrete time step a particle can jump forward with probability @xmath31 or stay put with probability @xmath32 , provided that the next site is empty .",
    "if the next site is occupied , the probability for a particle to stay put is @xmath33 .",
    "the probability deficit @xmath34 , corresponds to the process when the particle jumps to the adjoining occupied site , which is forbidden .",
    "this excluded process results in probability dissipation in this model .",
    "the form of the transition probabilities corresponds to the backward sequential update , i.e. the particles are updated starting from the @xmath0-th particles one by one in backward direction . in particular limiting cases the model reduces to    1 .",
    "@xmath35  -  vw , a particle jumps forward with probability @xmath31 or stays with probability @xmath36 , irrespective of whether the next site is occupied or not .",
    "but then those realizations of the process where two particles come to the same site must be removed from the statistical ensemble .",
    "@xmath37  -  tasep , a particle jumps forward with probability @xmath31 or stays with probability @xmath36 provided the adjoining site is empty .",
    "when the next site is occupied the particle stays where it is with probability @xmath38 .",
    "the tasep with the backward sequential update was studied in @xcite and @xcite , where it was referred to as a fragmentation model . in the case",
    "@xmath39 , the probability for a particle to stay where it is when the next site occupied , is zero .",
    "therefore , the trajectories of particles passing via neighboring sites have zero weight , i.e. they are removed from the ensemble as well as those which meet at the same site .",
    "therefore this situation resembles the vicious walks of dimers .",
    "the range of @xmath40 given in ( [ kappa range ] ) is due to the requirement for @xmath41 to be a probability .",
    "positive values of @xmath40 correspond to repulsive interaction , while negative values correspond to an attractive interaction .",
    "the domain @xmath42 is also of interest in connection with the current fluctuation in tasep , though it does not have a probabilistic meaning in the context of svw .",
    "let us consider the quantity@xmath43where the sum is over all the trajectories of the system starting at the configuration @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 .",
    "this quantity is the partition function of the statistical ensemble of the trajectories with the statistical weights defined above . on the other hand ,",
    "if we add the lacking processes allowing the particles to jump to an occupied site , the value of @xmath46 will have the meaning of probability for all the particles not to meet up to time @xmath5 . in fisher s original formulation of such a process",
    ", two particles annihilate when getting to the same site .",
    "then , @xmath46 is the probability for @xmath0 particles to survive up to time @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , we refer to this quantity as a survival probability .",
    "below we formulate three theorems , which specify the asymptotic behaviour of the survival probability in the limit of large time for different parts of the range of the parameter @xmath40 .",
    "the proof of these theorems is the content of sections 4,5 .",

    "the above lemmas , the formula for the mehta integral ( [ mehta ] ) and the definition ( [ f_m(alpha ) via j_m ] ) of @xmath89 establish the results ( [ alpha->+infty])-([alpha->-infty ] ) .",
    "the first result obtained in this paper is an expression for the survival probability for @xmath0 walkers in the svw model . at the fixed parameter @xmath441 and",
    "@xmath50 the leading asymptotics @xmath442 coincides with that for the usual vw @xcite .",
    "this result is intuitively clear . in the case of the vw",
    "it is obtained by considering the evolution of independent noninteracting particles and reducing the number of its outcomes by dropping those realizations where the crossings of particle time space trajectories occur .",
    "then , the asymptotics of the survival probability for two walkers @xmath152 follows directly from the diffusion law and the method of images . for @xmath0 walkers",
    ", the method of images involves @xmath443 reflecting wall planes .",
    "each wall brings with it a factor @xmath444 providing total contribution @xmath442 . for any fixed @xmath445",
    "the events of crossing occur with a finite , though changed , probability , so that this argument still holds .",
    "the survival probability changes by a constant factor dependent on @xmath40 , leaving fisher s law unchanged . as @xmath40",
    "approaches one this factor diverges , which indicates a qualitative change of behaviour of the survival probability .",
    "as the crossings become less probable , it finally saturates to the tasep normalization constant .",
    "the transition between the two regions takes place on the scale @xmath446 , where the effect of the diffusive spreading of particles becomes comparable to the one caused by svw interaction . in this case , the survival probability is expressed by the scaling function @xmath93 , which has the svw and tasep asymptotics as limiting cases .",
    "the formulas for the survival probability in svw can be reinterpreted in terms of the moment generating function of the time integrated particle current @xmath116 in tasep , which , in turn , can be used to construct the distribution of the same quantity .",
    "the cases of generic @xmath60 and @xmath447 correspond to the tails of the probability distribution of @xmath116 at the large deviation scale , characterizing positive , @xmath448 , and negative , @xmath449 , deviations respectively .",
    "the positive tail has the form specific for the current distribution for @xmath0 free independent bernoulli particles , while the form of the negative tail looks like that of the distribution for one bernoulli particle that makes @xmath0 steps at a time or @xmath0 particles jumping one step synchronously .",
    "such asymmetry reveals different mechanisms of positive and negative fluctuations . for positive deviations",
    "@xmath0 particles have to be `` accelerated '' independently . the main contribution to",
    "the negative deviations comes from the events when the first particle decelerates all particles following behind .",
    "our results are to be compared to the ones obtained by derrida and lebowitz @xcite ( see also @xcite ) for the large deviation function of the tasep current on a ring .",
    "in particular , they have shown that for large @xmath0 the non - universal tails of the current probability have the form @xmath450 and @xmath451 for positive and negative deviations respectively .",
    "our results have the same functional form even for finite @xmath0 with @xmath452 being a simple large deviation function of the bernoulli process .",
    "remarkably , such a mechanism survives on the infinite lattice , despite the particles drifting apart from each other in the course of time , so that they meet less and less often .",
    "the acceleration - deceleration asymmetry was also observed in the large deviations of the distance travelled by individual particles in tasep studied in @xcite for a general case of particle dependent hopping rates . there",
    "the negative large deviations do not depend on the order number of a particle whereas the positive ones do .",
    "the result obtained for the svw in the transition region @xmath453 provides us with the limiting distribution of the particle current measured at the diffusive scale , @xmath454 .",
    "the distribution obtained is parameter free , dependent only on the number of particles .",
    "we expect that it is a universal distribution for the systems of particles performing a driven diffusion , independent of the details of microscopic dynamics .",
    "the distribution has a skew , non - gaussian form , with tails matching the large deviation behaviour asymptotically .",
    "several directions for future work can be mentioned .",
    "first direct continuation of the present paper is an asymptotic study of the function @xmath96 as @xmath455 . considering a certain common scaling with the variable @xmath137",
    "is expected to give a new universal scaling function characterizing the kpz class .",
    "note that in the limiting cases this function reduces to mehta integrals , which are the probability normalization constants for gaussian random matrix ensembles , namely the unitary and orthogonal ensembles .",
    "the asymptotic evaluation of these integrals performed in the random matrix theory resulted in non - trivial densities of critical points , from which comes the leading contribution to the integrals @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see how these densities transform from one to another as the parameters vary between the limiting cases corresponding to different ensembles .",
    "it would also be interesting to study the tasep confined in a ring .",
    "the starting point of this analysis could be the recently obtained expressions for the green functions @xcite . in this way one could obtain a scaling function that characterizes the behaviour of kpz interfaces in finite systems .",
    "another possible development of the present article is a generalization of the above mentioned results for the probability distributions of the distance travelled by an individual particle in the tasep and the corresponding correlation functions to svw case .",
    "note that similar results exist also for the vw @xcite . in both cases the appropriately rescaled distribution of the distance travelled by a single particle starting from a half filled lattice",
    "is shown to converge , to the so - called tracy - widom distributions @xcite , which appear in the random matrix theory as a distribution of maximal eigenvalue in the gaussian ensembles , unitary in case of tasep and orthogonal for vw .",
    "the svw model establishes a bridge between these two cases .",
    "however , its green function has neither a tplitz form like in vw nor a special structure like in tasep , which allowed sasamoto , @xcite , to reinterpret it again as a problem of the vw and finally to represent its evolution as a determinantal point process .",
    "therefore , a significant extension of the existing techniques is in order . in this connection",
    "we should mention the recent advance for the partially asymmetric simple exclusion process @xcite-@xcite , which was made only on the basis of the bethe ansatz solution without use any free fermionic representation like vw .",
    "an interesting example of svw has been proposed recently by johansson johansson aztec in his analysis of a domino tilling problem on the aztec diamond known as the arctic circle problem .",
    "it was shown that the domino configurations are in one - to - one correspondence with trajectories of an @xmath456-particle process which is defined as follows . at each discrete time step",
    "a particle jumps forward with probability @xmath80 or stays put with probability @xmath457 .",
    "if the next site is occupied , the probability to stay put is @xmath458 as in the svw model .",
    "in addition , after each step , a particle @xmath18 can be translated back to the distance @xmath459 with probability @xmath460 provided that @xmath461 for all @xmath18 .",
    "if one chooses @xmath462 , the model belongs to the free fermion class and its transition probabilities admit a determinant representation .",
    "it has been shown in johansson aztec that the position of the first particle is described by the airy process in the thermodynamic limit for the domain wall boundary conditions in the domino tiling problem . by similarity of the models",
    ", one may expect that the extremal statistics of the svw model also exhibits a kind of tracy - widom distribution for appropriate initial conditions .",
