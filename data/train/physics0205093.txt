    "all of these studies have involved crystal phases that are either disordered or pure face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattices . in this work we present results for the structure and dynamics of the interface between an _ ordered _ two - component hard - sphere crystal with a sodium chloride ( nacl ) structure and a binary hard - sphere fluid . such a system can be viewed either as as a prototype to understand the interface between inter - metallic compounds and their coexisting fluid phases or as a model two - component colloidal dispersion .",
    "the hard - sphere interaction was chosen for this study since it is an important reference model for the study of simple liquids  @xcite and liquid mixtures  @xcite .",
    "this is especially true with regard to phenomena associated with the freezing transition .",
    "for example , it has been recently shown that the interfacial free energy of close - packed metals can be described with quantitative accuracy using a hard - sphere model  @xcite .",

    ", we examine two - component hard - sphere mixtures with a considerably larger size asymmetry of @xmath0 . this size ratio is significant in the theory of binary alloys in that it is the largest asymmetry in which the small spheres can be accommodated in the interstitials of a densest close - packed crystal of larger spheres .",

    "this procedure is not feasible since the size asymmetry ( @xmath0 ) and the mole fraction of small particles ( @xmath34 ) in the fluid system are both large .",
    "( it should be noted that for this value of @xmath9 the large sphere volume is over 14 times that of the small particle . ) to construct the fluid phase we began with an fcc lattice of small particles at a number density equal to the desired total number density of the fluid mixture . a number of particles , corresponding to the target mole fraction of large spheres ,",

    "the run was divided into blocks of @xmath43 cpp each .",
    "the sampling run was over a length of @xmath44 blocks , but since each block gives two independent measures of interfacial properties when the system is properly folded at the center of the crystal , the results reported are averages taken over 60 samples .",
    "in the course of such simulations the position of the interfacial plane can shift due to brownian motion or due to melting or freezing of the crystal . to prevent such motion from artificially broadening the interfacial profiles it is necessary to monitor the position of the interfacial plane during the sampling runs .",
    "the standard measure of interfacial position for a planar interface is the gibbs dividing surface@xcite defined for a multicomponent system as the value of @xmath37 where the surfaces excess number of `` solvent '' particles is zero .",
    "however , accurate calculation of the gibbs dividing surface requires relatively long simulation runs and is then unsuitable for a method of monitoring the time dependence of interfacial position . in our previous studies@xcite",

    "we define the interfacial position relative to the midpoint of the orientational order profile for the large particles .",
    "that is , @xmath58 in all of the @xmath59dependent profiles presented in this study is defined as the point at which the orientational order parameter has decayed halfway from its crystal to fluid value .",
    "this order parameter is suitable as a measure of interfacial position since it is smoothly monotonically decreasing and can be calculated accurately for very short runs .",
    "the parameter profiles of the small particles are not smoothly varying because at the interfacial region , some number of small particles cluster together to occupy large particle vacancies at the interfacial region ( as will be seen in the density plots presented in the next section ) disrupting the smooth transition from crystal - like to fluid - like value of the orientational order parameter .",
    "analysis of the interfacial position as a function of time shows that during the equilibration run the crystal exhibits some initial growth , but quickly stabilizes before the averaging runs are begun .",
    "brownian motion of the solid phase , as monitored by motion of the inner layers of the crystal , was found to be negligible due to the large system size and no correction was necessary .",
