    "permanent magnets are everywhere in our daily lives and will become more important in near future .",
    "there is a need for new materials as the abundance of the common rare earth based alloys has been questioned within the last years@xcite .",
    "however , competitive alternatives are still missing .",
    "the alloy fe - co has often been considered a promising candidate for rare earth free permanent magnets@xcite .",
    "its very high intrinsic magnetic moment@xcite is one prerequisite .",
    "the second requirement for a powerful permanent magnet is a strong magnetic anisotropy .",
    "however , this was not reported yet in fe - co samples of considerable size .",
    "the reason is the cubic symmetry of the alloy s unit cell in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "this causes an only weak cubic magnetic anisotropy@xcite .",
    "typically , the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ( mca ) is weak in cubic materials since spin - orbit coupling is lower than in uniaxial crystal structures which tend to exhibit strong magnetic anisotropies .",
    "already a decade ago , it was proposed to overcome the challenge of magnetic anisotropy by straining the unit cell@xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 ratio of the unit cell was used to describe the tetragonal strain where @xmath6 is the length of the strained axis and @xmath7 the length of the axes perpendicular to the applied strain .",
    "calculations@xcite based on density functional theory ( dft ) predicted remarkably high mcas if the unit cell would be tetragonally distorted with @xmath5 between 1.2 and 1.25 . the most common approach to strain the unit cell experimentally@xcite is coherent epitaxial growth of thin films on suitable substrates that provide appropriate in - plane lattice parameters  @xmath7 . assuming constant volume of the fe - co unit cell , a strain parallel to the film normal is expected when @xmath7 is smaller than the equilibrium lattice parameter of fe - co .",
    "up to now , tetragonally distorted fe - co films with perpendicular easy axis of magnetization could not be produced with film thicknesses exceeding 15 monolayers ( ml)@xcite . thicker films do not exhibit a perpendicular easy axis since lattice relaxation takes place . after strain relaxation ,",
    "shape anisotropy exceeds mca and dominates the magnetic performance causing in - plane easy axes .",
    "this thickness dependent spin reorientation transition has been described recently by kim and hong@xcite .    in order to maintain the strain in films thicker than , new concepts have to be applied . in a recent study ,",
    "delczeg - czirjak et al.@xcite calculated that small atoms like carbon may stabilize the strain in fe - co .",
    "their dft calculations identify the preferential positions of the c atoms being interstitials along the @xmath6 axis of the fe - co lattice ( fig.[dft ] ) preferring lattice positions between two co atoms .",

    "the only difference is a reduced x - ray coherence length in the films with higher c content which indicates a reduction of crystal size .",

    "for both , the binary and the ternary fe - co - c films , the highest @xmath8 is reached for ultrathin films with thicknesses below .",

    "fe - co films with oop magnetic easy axis were already reported for thicknesses up to , i.e. , @xcite .",

    "while in the latter , only the first few monolayers ( see fig.[rheed]c ) are strained tetragonally , the fe - co - c lattice exhibits a strain up to film thicknesses of at least .",
    "this is the reason why the @xmath8 of these films is maintained above . in the binary films ,",

    "as already discussed in the introduction , the tetragonal distortion was predicted by delczeg - czirjak et al.@xcite for fe - co alloyed with carbon .",
    "the present study proves these findings also for lower c contents of only 2at% . however , higher c contents did not further strain the unit cell as predicted in the literature@xcite where 6at% c led to @xmath27 ratios of 1.12 .",

    "however , the experimental @xmath8 seems to be closer to the vca based theoretical value than to the cpa based one .",
    "already delczeg et al.@xcite reported , that cpa might underestimate the effect of disorder on mca when compared to more accurate special quasirandom structures ( sqs ) .",
    "the observed good agreement between experimental and theoretical results also indicates that a reduction of c content from 3 to 2at% does not lower the mca when the state of strain is kept .",
    "as expected , the mca is more sensitive to the @xmath5 ratio than to the c content .",
    "an additional explanation is that a higher amount of c atoms , which is expected to result in a higher strain@xcite , may introduce local disorder .",
    "this disorder could cause a reduction of @xmath8 when compared to a highly symmetric distorted fe - co crystal with no c atoms@xcite .",
    "hence , a not too high c content is expected to be beneficial for structural and magnetic properties .",
    "in this study , carbon was alloyed to fe - co in order to stabilise the tetragonal distortion of the unit cell .",
    "it was shown that already a very low fraction of c can benefit the formation of a phase with tetragonal lattice symmetry . for 2 at%  c in fe@xmath0co@xmath1 the former cubic lattice",
    "is strained by 3% .",
    "this strain is small when compared to theoretical calculations for fe - co with higher c content@xcite .",
    "however , it has a remarkable influence on the magnetic properties as it establishes a uniaxial mca .",
    "our experimental results confirm the applied theoretical model where the c atoms preferentially occupy positions along the @xmath6 axis of the fe - co lattice .",
    "if this did not happen , an isotropically strained cubic lattice would be expected .",
    "we find strong indications that ( fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2c@xmath3 prepared under the named conditions forms a spontaneously strained phase : ( 1 ) after an initial lattice relaxation which takes place in the first grown monolayers , the relaxation stops at a state with a lattice distortion of 1.03 ( see fig.[rheed]c ) .",
    "( 2 ) this lattice distortion is independent of film thickness , as it is observed in films with thicknesses between and .",
    "we find no indications for a driving force that promotes a further relaxation .",
    "the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy of the described alloy was determined to be approx . .",
    "this experimental result agrees with bounds predicted by dft calculations based on two different methods of treating the chemical disorder .",
    "our study shows that apart from ultrathin films , also thicker films based on fe - co can exhibit magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "although their anisotropy is still too low to be competitive to the common hard magnetic alloys , we consider our results as one step towards possible permanent magnet alternatives based on 3d elements .",
    "the capability of small atoms like c to strain the former cubic lattice of fe - co is a key message of this work .",
    "comparable elements  ( b , n ) are expected to act similarly .",
    "one important advantage of additions of these elements in small amount is that a high magnetic moment is maintained . as a spontaneously strained phase in fe - co - c",

    "<S> rare earth free alloys are in focus of permanent magnet research since the accessibility of the elements needed for nowadays conventional magnets is limited . tetragonally strained iron - cobalt ( fe - co ) has attracted large interest as promising candidate due to theoretical calculations . in experiments , however , the applied strain quickly relaxes with increasing film thickness and hampers stabilization of a strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy . in our study we show that already 2at% of carbon substantially reduce the lattice relaxation leading to the formation of a spontaneously strained phase with 3% tetragonal distortion . in these strained ( fe@xmath0co@xmath1)@xmath2c@xmath3 films , a magnetocrystalline anisotropy above 0.4mj / m@xmath4 is observed while the large polarization of is maintained . </S>",
    "<S> compared to binary fe - co this is a remarkable improvement of the intrinsic magnetic properties . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we relate our experimental work to theoretical studies of strained fe - co - c and find a very good agreement . </S>"
