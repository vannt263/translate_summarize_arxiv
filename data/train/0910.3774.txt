    "the instanton on @xmath36 with nontrivial holonomy was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the key observation is that the holonomy causes the instanton to split into two electrically charged monopoles or dyons of opposite charges .",
    "the holonomy fixes the size and charge of the monopole .",
    "since this instanton splitting mechanism is central to our construction below we now summarize it in flat space .",

    "the value @xmath55 of the holonomy is thus far arbitrary .",
    "we now note that the topological repulsion ( [ omega ] ) between instantons of unit charge triggers dyons of topological charges @xmath42 and @xmath56 . the balancing of this repulsion in conjunction with the balancing of the coulomb forces is simply realized for @xmath66 irrespective of the details of the dyon interactions . as a result ,",

    "the arrangement is salt - like with a unit cell @xmath39 .",
    "this is a bcc crystal of half - instantons or dyons per cubic cell @xmath68 .",
    "the instanton or baryon density is    n_b== [ dens ] which is commensurate with the initial density of fcc instantons , namely a cell unit of @xmath69 with 4 instantons .",
    "hence our initial choice of the fcc configuration for the instantons at low density .",
    "( [ dens ] ) reflects on the half - instanton symmetry of the bcc dyonic salt , which is dual to the half - skyrmion symmetry on the boundary .    to estimate the density at which the transition from the fcc crystal of instanton to the bcc crystal of dyons occur",
    ", we note that in the flat space periodic instanton with fixed holonomy  @xcite that we shall refer to as kvll , the separation distance @xmath70 of the dyons is  @xcite    r_+-=2 [ rpm ] with @xmath71 the kvll instanton size with zero holonomy .",
    "we recall that our unit cell is @xmath39 for the instantons in the fcc crystal .",
    "@xmath57 yields @xmath72 which is the nearest neighbor distance in the bcc configuration .",
    "thus @xmath73 or a critical density @xmath74 .    in hqcd",

    "the moment of inertia parameter @xmath76 follows by collectively quantizing the flavor instanton as a baryon .",
    "specifically @xmath77 with @xmath78 the delta - nucleon mass splitting .",
    "empirically , @xmath79 mev . setting the instanton bps mass to the nucleon mass @xmath80 gev , it follows that @xmath81 fm and @xmath82 fm .",
    "so the fcc to bcc transition takes place at @xmath83 or @xmath84 with @xmath85 the nuclear matter density .",
    "the value of @xmath82 fm is amusingly close to the numerical value of @xmath86 fm reported in  @xcite for a half - skyrmion cubic crystal .",
    "the energy density for which the fcc to bcc transition occurs can be estimated using the madelung constant of salt  @xcite and ignoring the contribution from the topological repulsion and the mesonic cloud for simplicity .",
    "the energy per instanton which is dual to the energy per baryon is @xmath87 , with    = ( e^2+g^2)(t^3)^2(_-^+1l^2+z^2)m_d= ( e^2+g^2)(t^3)^2m_d [ bin ] where @xmath88 is the energy to bring a dyon in a bcc configuration . here",
    "@xmath89 is madelung constant for salt in units of the nearest neighbor distance @xmath68 .",
    "the z - integration in ( [ bin ] ) is over the conformal direction since the crystal does not extend in this direction .",
    "it is cutoff by the kvll instanton size @xmath71 at zero holonomy . for @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath82 fm ,",
    "the energy to assemble the core dyons in the bcc configuration is @xmath92 mev .",
    "we expect this estimate to change somehow by including the core @xmath93 repulsion and the pion attraction , which tends to balance overall .",
    "our core estimate of @xmath88 is surprisingly close to the @xmath94 mev binding for the cubic crystal of half - skyrmion symmetry in  @xcite .",
    "does the dyonic salt configuration in bulk correspond to a chirally restored phase at high density ?",
    "this issue in the skyrme model is rather elusive , as most numerical calculations show only a restoration of chiral symmetry on the average per cell . in this section",
    "we suggest a geometrical transition in bulk in support of the restoration of chiral symmetry following the splitting of the instanton into two dyons .    in the spontaneously broken phase ,",
    "the d8+@xmath95 configuration is depicted in fig .",
    "the baryon vertex corresponds to a wrapping of the d8 brane around @xmath21 .",
    "this d4 wrapping is analogous to a point instanton in d8+@xmath95 and is dual to a baryon on the boundary .",
    "the baryon vertex is attached by @xmath4 strings .",
    "pions as goldstone modes are fluctuations of the holonomy along the curve @xmath96 as shown also in fig .  3a .",
    "the bare skyrmion with no meson cloud is just the holonomy running through the core instanton .",
    "the cloud corresponds to fluctuations on the flavor brane and tied to the core  @xcite .",
    "geometry alone makes it plausible that when the instanton splits into two dyons , the geometry of fig .",
    "3a is replaced by the geometry of fig .",
    "3b , whereby the d8 and @xmath97 branes separates from each other as we explicit in fig .  4 for a single instanton .",
    "as a result , the baryon vertex fractionates with @xmath98 strings joining d8 and @xmath98 strings joining @xmath95 as in fig .  4b .",
    "this equal opportunity splitting of d4 corresponds to two half instantons .",
    "the essential question here is what happens to compact d4 in d8 , or the instanton wrapping @xmath21 ?",
    "it is essentially similar to what happens to d0 in d4 for the caloron in fg .",
    "[ caloron ] as we discussed earlier .",
    "to understand this , we recall that near the d8 s , @xmath21 is compactified and can be ignored .",
    "thus d8 is essentially d4 stretching in @xmath41 and the conformal direction @xmath27 direction , while the baryon vertex is d0 .",
    "notice that d8 is along @xmath38 near the tip therefore the @xmath27 direction is a point along the @xmath38 direction . taking the t - dual transform along @xmath38 turns d0 into d1 and d4 into d3 . summarizing : we obtain the d3-d1 configuration by taking the t - duality along the @xmath38 direction , thereby explaining the splitting mechanism into dyons as shown in fig .",
    "4c . throughout , the compact @xmath21 is a spectator .    under the splitting of d8 and @xmath95 ,",
    "the right and left wilson lines decouple u^r_1/2(x)= p(i_0^+ * a*_z(x , z)dz ) , u^l_1/2(x)=p(i^0_- * a*_z(x , z)dz ) + with each sourced by @xmath98 string . in each of the probe brane ,",
    "the half instantons or dyons are repulsive through their leading core @xmath93 repulsion much like their mother instantons .",
    "they form two distinct @xmath99 crystals . on the boundary which is our world , the two half - instanton crystals superimpose in a maximally repulsive configuration which is our bcc dyonic salt of half - instantons .",
    "we note that the @xmath99 crystalline structures are commensurate with the @xmath0 dyonic structures as both are interchangeable by parity .",
    "the current geometrical description is plausible but clearly not rigorous and awaits more detailed computational analysis in dense hqcd .",
    "the transition from the confined geometry to the deconfined geometry with half instantons is perhaps of the type discussed in  @xcite whereby the coupling constant of the compactified boundary gauge theory is dialed to decrease in analogy with the running of the qcd coupling at high density .",
    "-3 cm    [ db1 ]    -1 cm",
    "in @xcite , an analogy was drawn between the half - skyrmion phase in dense baryonic matter and the half - skyrmion phase in the nel magnet - vbs paramagnet transition in ( 2 + 1 ) d condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "this analogy could be better illustrated in terms of the instanton - dyon transition proposed in this paper . in the condensed matter case , the half - skyrmions confined in a skyrmion split into their constituents by the suppression of the  monopoles \" ( i.e. , the hedgehogs in 3d ) of the emergent @xmath100 gauge field , giving rise to a non - ginzburg - landau - wilson phase that intervenes between the initial and final phases . in holography , the half - instantons or dyons confined into the original instanton split at higher density due to the emergence of strong holonomies in the spatial directions .",
    "we have presented general arguments for why an fcc initial arrangement of instantons should split into a bcc crystal of half instantons or dyons .",
    "the coulomb electric and magnetic forces between the dyons cause them to reorganize in a salt like configuration naturally for maximum screening .",
    "the net repulsive topological interaction between the individual dyons balance naturally when all dyons in the salt like configuration carry equal topological charges , thus equal masses .",
    "the fcc initial arrangement , while optimal for the dyon splitting , is not necessary in general .",
    "indeed , once a crystal is formed at very low density , say an fcc for instance , then by increasing the density we increase the strength of the spatial holonomies thereby causing the instanton to fractionate .",
    "the salt like configuration of equal dyons follows by balancing the coulomb and topological forces .",
    "conversely , the bcc configuration at high density smoothly converts to an fcc configuration at lower density through the matching of the densities as in ( [ dens ] ) making it energetically the most favorable .    using the kvll instanton to assess the dyon separation in an instanton with a finite holonomy",
    ", we have shown that the transition from an fcc to a bcc configuration of dyons is expected when the dyons are about 1 fm apart , or for baryon densities of the order of 3 times nuclear matter density .",
    "this transition is also supported by a geometrical transition in bulk whereby the d4 baryon vertex on @xmath21 fractionates by @xmath101 .",
    "we have presented plausible geometrical arguments in favor of the restoration of chiral symmetry upon the formation of the half - instanton bcc crystal .",
    "the latter is dual to the simple cubic crystal of half - skyrmions .",
    "while the arguments in favor of a skyrmion crystal of half - skyrmion symmetry are not new , we believe that our holographic accounting of this phenomenon in bulk is .",
    "moreover , the geometrical character of the transition we have suggested together with the physical nature of the splitting of instantons into dyons provides the robustness needed for a topological phase transition in qcd at large @xmath4 .",
    "our simple estimates for the density and energy per baryon for the occurrence of the bcc dyonic crystal are surprisingly close to those obtained using detailed numerical calculations with skyrmions  @xcite .",
    "most of our estimates involve the physics of the baryon cores which is uniquely described by instantons in holography .",
    "this is in contrast to the skyrme model , where the core physics is at the mercy of the choice of the stabilizing term ( say the fourth order derivative term for instance ) which is not fixed by current algebra . as we mentioned earlier , we expect the core estimates to be altered somehow by the addition of the cloud contributions  @xcite as they are likely to overall balance .",
    "the current arguments complement the instanton holographic transition reported on @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "we should stress that the phenomenon described in this paper does not address color deconfinement of qcd .",
    "the half - instantons we have described are hadrons in color - confined phase , with , however , chiral symmetry restored as is the case with the half - skyrmions in cc  @xcite . as suggested in @xcite , this could be identified with the quarkyonic phase conjectured for large @xmath4 qcd  @xcite .",
    "finally , the geometrical arguments we have presented as well as our dyonic salt configuration may be of relevance to the finite temperature confinement deconfinement transition in qcd with colored instead of flavored instantons and antiinstantons  @xcite . while at low temperature qcd may be viewed as an instanton - antiinstanton ( caloron - anticaloron ) liquid , it was suggested in  @xcite that for a critical temperature the ( kvll ) instantons and antinstantons may ionize to bps dyons . the ionic phase may be a plasma of dyons for sufficiently weak gauge coupling or high temperature  @xcite .",
    "however , near the critical temperature , the gauge coupling is still strong enough to warrant a liquid or perhaps even a weakly crystallized forms of dyons .",
    "we will return to some of these issues next .",
