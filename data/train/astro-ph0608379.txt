    "the simplest version of the standard fireball model for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) involves a spherical explosion taking place in a uniform or a stratified surrounding medium . when an explosion deposits a large amount of energy into material with a much smaller amount of rest energy within a compact volume , an ultra - relativistic pair fireball is formed @xcite .",
    "the large pressure of the explosion causes the fireball to expand , and the thermal energy of the explosion is transformed into bulk kinetic energy due to strong adiabatic cooling of the particles in the comoving frame . because of the thomson coupling between the particles and photons , most of the original explosion energy is eventually carried by the baryons that were originally mixed into the explosion @xcite .",
    "this bulk kinetic energy can not be efficiently radiated as gamma rays unless it is converted back to internal energy ( i.e. the velocities of the protons must be re - randomized ) .",
    "this requires shocks , and in order to tap a reasonable fraction of the total kinetic energy , the shocks must be ( at least mildly ) relativistic .",
    "impact on an external medium would randomize about half of the initial energy merely by reducing the expansion lorentz factor by a factor of @xmath2 @xcite . alternatively",
    ", internal shocks may form within the outflow : for instance , if the lorentz factor of the outflow varied by a factor @xmath3 , then the shocks that developed when fast material overtakes slower material would be internally ( at least mildly ) relativistic .",
    "there is a general consensus that the longer complex bursts must involve internal shocks , while simple smooth profiles could arise from an external shock interaction @xcite .",
    "the latter would in effect be the beginning of the afterglow .",
    "an external shock moving into a medium with a smooth density profile would naturally result in a burst with a simple time - profile .",
    "angular variations within the outflow might still cause variability in the light curve , but variations on very small angular scales ( @xmath4 , where @xmath1 in the initial lorentz factor ) are required in order to produce the large variability of the prompt grb emission @xcite .",
    "a blobby external medium could produce significant variability only if the covering factor of blobs is low , implying modest efficiency .",
    "furthermore , the resulting variability in the light curve would be small if produced close to or after the deceleration radius , or if the portion of the ejecta that collides with a blob is decelerated significantly @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this _ letter _ is to demonstrate that if the prompt emission is produced by the simplest version of the external shock model , this implies a specific relation between the observed duration , isotropic equivalent energy ( or luminosity ) , and photon peak energy , which is apparently incompatible with observations .",
    "this relation is derived in   [ sec : es ] and compared to observations in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] .",
    "the implications are discussed in   [ sec : dis ] along with possible caveats .",
    "in the simplest version of the external shock model , the outflow is approximated by a uniform thin shell .",
    "a forward shock is driven into the external medium by the outflowing ejecta , while the latter is decelerated by a reverse shock ( and/or by @xmath5 work across the contact discontinuity that separates it from the shocked external medium ) .",
    "the dynamics of a spherical shock wave eventually approaches a self - similar evolution @xcite which depends only on the explosion energy @xmath6 and on the external mass density @xmath7 ( the lorentz factor depends only on their ratio , @xmath8 ) .",
    "if the initial grb outflow is collimated , an additional parameter  the jet initial half - opening angle , @xmath9 , is required in order to specify the flow . however , for @xmath10 ( as appears to be the case from afterglow modeling ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the dynamics at early times  before the jet break time ( as long as @xmath11 ) do not significantly deviate from the spherical case , where the true kinetic energy @xmath6 is replaced by its isotropic equivalent value @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , it is still valid to adopt the spherical dynamics for the prompt emission from the external shock in this case as well .    most of the energy is transfered to the shocked external medium at the deceleration radius , @xmath13 , where the inertia of the swept - up external matter starts to produce an appreciable slowing down of the ejecta . for a given shock dynamics , the luminosity and spectrum of the emitted radiation",
    "are determined by the fractions @xmath14 and @xmath15 of internal energy in the shocked fluid that are carried , respectively , by the magnetic field and by relativistic electrons , as well as by the shape of the electron distribution function .    as seen in the rest frame of the downstream fluid ,",
    "most of the mass and of the kinetic energy of the incoming upstream fluid is in protons ( or other ions ) , unless the external medium is highly enriched in @xmath16 pairs .",
    "therefore , a simple isotropization of the velocities of the upstream particles at the shock transition would give the electrons only a very small fraction of the total internal energy ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this would imply a very small radiative efficiency , since the radiation is emitted primarily by electrons . for a radiatively efficient system ,",
    "physical processes must therefore transfer a large fraction of the swept - up energy to the electron component .",
    "the energy of the particles can be further boosted by diffusive shock acceleration as they scatter repeatedly across the shock interface , acquiring a power law distribution @xmath18 at @xmath19 .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field is another major uncertainty .",
    "most of the required magnetic field must typically be generated in - situ , presumably through plasma instabilities or turbulent motions , but its strength has yet to be derived from first principles .",
    "the standard prescription is to assume that the magnetic field energy density @xmath20 is a fixed fraction @xmath14 of the downstream proper internal energy density , @xmath21 , where primed quantities are measured in the comoving frame .",
    "the typical ( minimal ) electron energy is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the lorentz factor of the fluid behind the forward shock , and @xmath24 is the number of relativistic electrons ( or positrons ) per proton , which for a proton - electron plasma is equal to the fraction of the electrons that are accelerated to relativistic energies . and @xmath24 would not include possible additional components , such as a thermal component . ]",
    "the peak synchrotron photon energy is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is @xmath28 in units of @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 for @xmath32 ) . for @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 ) we have @xmath35^{1/(3-k ) } =   \\left[\\frac{(3-k)e_{\\rm iso}}{4\\pi n_{\\rm dec}m_p c^2 \\gamma_0 ^ 2}\\right]^{1/3}\\ , \\\\",

    "therefore , the dependence on both @xmath0 and @xmath48 ( which are hard to determine from observations ) can be eliminated by taking the combination @xmath50 .    the strength of eq .",
    "[ psi ] is that it depends mainly on quantities that can either be directly measured , like the peak photon energy ( @xmath46 ) and the duration of the grb ( @xmath51 ) , or that can be reasonably constrained by observations . here",
    "@xmath52 is the isotropic equivalent kinetic energy of the outflow , which for a reasonable radiative efficiency , @xmath53 , is of the order of the isotropic equivalent energy output in gamma - rays , @xmath54 , that is measured directly .",
    "in order to compare the limit imposed by eq .  [ psi ] with observations , we use the following observational properties derived by @xcite and @xcite : @xmath55 , @xmath46 and @xmath54 . in fig .",

    "filled circles are _ typical _ long bursts from the sample compiled by @xcite , while the empty circles are the four long grbs found so far to be spectroscopically associated with type ic supernovae @xcite . of the latter , three have a smooth , single peak temporal profile ( while grb  030329 has two peaks ) .",

    "more typical values that are inferred from afterglow modeling ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) would result in the values of @xmath24 being smaller by a factor of @xmath63 when compared to @xmath64 .",
    "it is also important to note that @xmath54 is used as an estimate for the isotropic equivalent kinetic energy @xmath52 .",
    "this would increase the value of @xmath64 by a factor of @xmath65^{1/4}$ ] , where @xmath66 is the @xmath67-ray efficiency : @xmath68 .",
    "however , even for @xmath67-ray efficiencies as low as @xmath69 , @xmath64 would only increase by a factor of @xmath70 .",
    "it has been shown that the simplest version of the external shock model implies a relation between different observed quantities of the grb ( eq .  [ psi ] ) , which can conveniently be expressed in the form @xmath71 , where @xmath24 is the number of accelerated electrons per proton .",
    "naively , for the standard assumption that @xmath72 , one would expect @xmath73 for typical values of @xmath61 and @xmath74 .",
    "it is conceivable , however , that only a small fraction of the electrons participate in the acceleration process ( i.e. @xmath75 ) . is possible , especially near @xmath13 , due to pair enrichment of the ambient medium from pair production by gamma - ray photons that are scattered on the external medium @xcite . ]",
    "a comparison with observations shows , however , that @xmath58 ( and @xmath76 ) for the vast majority of grbs ( figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this implies that grbs could arise from synchrotron emission in the external shock only if the efficiency of electron acceleration in relativistic collisionless shocks is very low ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "an external shock origin might still be possible if the radiation process responsible for the gamma rays is other than than synchrotron radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the prompt gamma - ray emission might arise from completely different mechanism , such as internal shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it should be noted that afterglow observations already provide interesting constraints on the efficiency of electron acceleration @xcite .",
    "current observations imply that the characteristic energy of accelerated electrons is comparable to the proton post - shock temperature .",
    "they also imply that the efficiency @xmath24 is similar for highly relativistic and sub - relativistic shocks and plausibly suggest that @xmath77 . however , even values of @xmath24 as low as @xmath17 can not be ruled out , since currently testable afterglow predictions remain unchanged for @xmath78 and @xmath79 for any @xmath24 in the range @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "estimates of the energy in the afterglow shock from late time radio observations when the flow is only mildly relativistic and starts to approach spherical symmetry ( often called  radio calorimetry  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) typically yield @xmath81erg assuming @xmath82 .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite , afterglow observations actually constrain @xmath83 rather than @xmath84 .",
    "the true kinetic energies at late times are thus given by @xmath85erg .",
    "the initial energy content of the outflow could be even larger due to early radiative losses ( i.e. , during the prompt grb and early afterglow stages ) .",
    "it is difficult to accurately account for the magnitude of such losses , as they depend on poorly known questions about postshock energy exchange between protons and electrons .",
    "nevertheless , a lower limit on the radiated energy is given by @xmath86 ( additional energy may be radiated outside the observed photon energy range , or during the early afterglow ) .",
    "other possible channels of energy loss are the escape of accelerated non - thermal protons from the blast wave ( high energy cosmic rays ) or the production of high energy neutrinos via pion decay .",
    "any added losses would inevitably lead to a further increase in the energy requirements .",
    "therefore , very small values of @xmath24 would imply very large energy contents .",
    "another test of the simple external shock model is provided by a comparison of the correlation found by @xcite between the isotropic equivalent luminosity , the burst duration , and the peak energy , with that predicted by eq .",
    "[ psi0 ] . in the cosmological frame of the grb",
    "this correlation reads @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is defined by @xcite to be the time during which 45% of the counts above background are measured ( which is expected to scale linearly with @xmath89 ) .",
    "this is in disagreement with eq .",
    "[ psi0 ] , which , for a reasonably small scatter in @xmath90 , gives @xmath91 .",
    "it is natural to hope that the values of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath92 and @xmath24 are universal , since they are determined by the microphysics of the collisionless shock .",
    "however , the wide distribution of @xmath56 values seen in fig .  [ fig2 ] suggests otherwise . that is , in the simplest version of the external shock model , a large scatter in @xmath90 is required .",
    "the presence of a significant number of non shock - accelerated electrons in the external shock ( @xmath75 ) appears to be more prominent for the sub - sample of bursts found to be spectroscopically associated with a supernova ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , most of which have a smooth temporal profile @xcite .",
    "the low values of @xmath24 do not , however , increase the total energy requirements to unreasonable values for these events as they have rather low values of @xmath52 . under this interpretation ,",
    "a wide range of shock microphysical parameters may be the rule , rather than the exception .    in conclusion , observations of the prompt emission in grbs with known redshifts , which are becoming far more accessible in the _ swift _ era ,",
    "can provide an important diagnostic of the external shock model .",
    "current observational constraints do not allow for efficient electron acceleration in the external shock , if its synchrotron emission produces the observed prompt gamma - ray emission .",
    "although there is no a priori reason to suspect that @xmath24 should be large , @xmath75 would dramatically increase the total kinetic energy budget .",
