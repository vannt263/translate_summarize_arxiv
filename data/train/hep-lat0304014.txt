    "for simulating fully dynamical lattice qcd at light quark masses , staggered ( kogut - susskind , ks ) fermions have the advantage of being very fast relative to other available methods @xcite .",
    "in addition , an exact chiral symmetry for massless quarks is retained at finite lattice spacing .",
    "however , the advantage in speed of ks fermions may be offset by systematic issues : on present realistic lattices ( _ e.g. _ ,  recent milc simulations @xcite with @xmath1 ) , the ks taste in the massless , continuum limit , but is broken at @xmath0 .",
    "we reserve the term `` flavor '' for true ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) flavor .",
    "] violations are not negligible . indeed , despite the fact that the milc simulations use an improved ( `` asqtad '' ) action that reduces taste violations to @xmath5 , these effects can still introduce significant lattice artifacts .",
    "since one can control the taste of the external particles explicitly in the simulation , taste - violating artifacts show up primarily in loop diagrams . in particular , any quantity or computation that is sensitive to chiral ( pseudoscalar meson )",
    "loops can be expected to show large artifacts at current lattice spacings . in order to perform controlled chiral extrapolations and extract physical results with small discretization errors from staggered simulations ,",
    "it is necessary to include the effects of taste violations explicitly in the chiral perturbation theory ( 0.4expt ) calculations to which the simulations are compared .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop such a `` staggered chiral perturbation theory '' ( s0.4expt ) .",
    "one can think of the milc simulations as introducing flavor with separate ks fields for @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks .",
    "the 4 tastes for each field are then reduced to 1 by taking the fourth root of the quark determinants for each flavor .",
    "is always chosen equal to @xmath6 in the milc simulations , one actually uses a slightly simpler procedure in practice .",
    "only two ks fields are introduced , and the square root of the @xmath7 determinant is taken .",
    "however , assuming algorithmic effects ( step - size errors , autocorrelations ) are under control , the two approaches are equivalent . we therefore prefer to consider the conceptually simpler case where each ks field represents a single flavor .",
    "] the theory with @xmath8 does not have a local lattice action , and there is some concern that non - universal behavior may thereby be introduced in the continuum limit .",
    "if we are able to show , by comparing simulations to s0.4exptforms , that the staggered theory produces the expected chiral behavior in the continuum limit with controlled @xmath0 errors , it should go a long way toward easing worries about the @xmath8 trick .",
    "a starting point for any s0.4expt  calculation is the work of lee and sharpe @xcite , who derived the @xmath0 chiral lagrangian for a single ks field ( 1 flavor , 4 tastes ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a generalization of the lee ",
    "sharpe lagrangian to multiple quark flavors was introduced to calculate chiral loop effects . however , there are subtleties in the generalization that were not appreciated in ref .",
    "@xcite , leading to errors in the multi - flavor chiral lagrangian and hence in the final chiral - logarithm formulas .",
    "these same subtleties also turn out to have implications even for the tree - level comparison ( in ref .",
    "@xcite ) of the 1-flavor theory with simulations .    below",
    "we will follow the outlines of the three - step procedure introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which we restate here for completeness :    * generalize the lee - sharpe lagrangian to correspond to @xmath9 staggered quark fields , resulting in a ( broken ) @xmath10 chiral theory . where convenient",
    ", we will specialize to the case of interest , @xmath11 .",
    "we call the @xmath11 theory the `` @xmath12 '' theory , since it has three flavors , each with four tastes ; its symmetry is a broken @xmath13 . *",
    "calculate one loop quantities ( such as @xmath14 ) in the @xmath12 theory . *",
    "adjust , by hand , the result to a single taste per flavor in order to correspond to the physical case ( and to simulation data ) .",
    "this adjustment corresponds to the @xmath8 trick .",
    "it requires an understanding of the correspondence between the meson diagrams at the chiral level and the underlying quark diagrams and is basically the `` quark flow '' technique of ref .",
    "@xcite . for non - degenerate",
    "quark masses , we call the adjusted case the @xmath15 theory ; when we take @xmath16 ( which corresponds to the milc simulations ) we call it the @xmath17 theory .    the difficulties in ref",
    ".  @xcite arose in step 1 .",
    "fierz transformations were used to simplify the flavor structure in the taste - symmetry breaking potential . however , ref .",
    "@xcite had already employed fierz transformations to simplify the form of this potential .",
    "the two transformations turn out not to be compatible . in the lee - sharpe case",
    ", there was only one flavor , so this was not an issue . by properly taking into account the mixing of the flavor indices , we find that two of the six terms in the symmetry - breaking potential of ref .",
    "@xcite are incorrect .",
    "another difference with ref .",
    "@xcite is that there @xmath9 was taken to be 2 , and step 3 was modified to adjust the @xmath7 loops according to a @xmath18 , rather than a @xmath8 trick .",
    "this was due to the fact that ref .",
    "@xcite took @xmath19 from the beginning .",
    "however , the entire procedure is much clearer if every quark flavor is treated equivalently .",
    "further , we will see that it is important to be able to treat directly charged pions ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xmath20 ) that are composed of two independent flavors transforming under an exact lattice flavor symmetry ( when @xmath19 ) .",
    "finally , the calculation is actually simpler when we keep all three quark masses unequal .",
    "the fact that the goldstone charged pion mass squared must then have an overall factor of @xmath21 gives a very useful check on our calculation .",
    "generalizing the taste - breaking potential properly has lead us to realize that flavor - neutral mesons in certain taste - nonsinglet channels can mix at tree - level due to `` hairpin '' diagrams .",
    "we can now see that such diagrams are present even in one - flavor 0.4expt",
    "@xcite ; their effects have however not been appreciated previously .",
    "the coefficients of the hairpin diagrams that arise here are new parameters in the chiral theory and have to be fit with simulation data or determined perturbatively .",

    "we can thus make the replacement : @xmath74 where the @xmath75 are @xmath62 matrices , and the @xmath63 on the right hand side are still @xmath23 taste matrices .",

    "@xcite does not keep the operators in the same single - trace form .    to see this ,",

    "to @xmath0 in the dual @xmath93 expansion , the taste - breaking operators can be computed in the chiral limit .",

    "this error would go away if one worked very close to the continuum limit , where `` very close '' here means @xmath388 , with @xmath389 a constant that depends on the particular staggered action , and @xmath281 is the chiral scale . for pions light enough for 0.4expt  to be applicable , however , this condition is very difficult to satisfy without further improvement in the staggered action than is currently available .",
    "the s0.4expt   formulas above will therefore remain crucial , at least in the near term , for determining the systematic errors in the results .",
