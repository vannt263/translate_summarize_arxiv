    "there have been several investigations of the approach to the singularity in inhomogeneous cosmologies , predominantly in the case that a two - dimensional symmetry group acts spatially @xcite .",
    "the most extensively studied class of such spacetimes is the class of gowdy spacetimes@xcite on @xmath7 .",
    "numerical studies of these spacetimes show that the approach to the singularity is asymptotically velocity term dominated ( avtd ) except at an isolated set of points .",
    "as shown in @xcite this behavior can be understood by considering certain terms in the equations as `` potentials '' that affect the dynamics at each spatial point .",
    "these potentials drive the dynamics into the avtd regime , except at those isolated points where one of the potentials vanishes .",
    "the behavior at each of these isolated points differs from that of its neighbors , leading to the creation of features called spikes that become narrow as the singularity is approached .",
    "the analysis of @xcite uses an explicit approximation to find a closed form expression for the behavior of the spikes .",
    "however , this approximation only remains valid throughout the approach to the singularity for a certain class of spikes : those for which the `` velocity '' @xmath8 of the spike is `` low '' ( @xmath9 for `` upward pointing spikes '' and @xmath10 for `` downward pointing spikes '' ) .",
    "what then happens if a spike forms and it initially has `` high '' velocity ? certain terms in the evolution equations which are decaying for low velocity spikes are instead growing in magnitude for a high velocity spike and the sign of the net effect is such that the velocity should decrease @xcite .",
    "an explicit approximation that is valid as the velocity at a high velocity spike decreases has not been found , leaving open the question , `` what is the long term behavior of initially high velocity spikes in gowdy spacetimes ? ''    to answer this question , we perform numerical simulations of gowdy spacetimes with these high velocity spikes .",
    "since the spikes become ever narrower as the singularity is approached , until just this narrowness causes the velocity to decrease if it is originally high , extremely high resolution is needed to follow the detailed behavior of the spike .",
    "we use a numerical method that was used in @xcite to study critical collapse . here",
    "the equations are put in characteristic form and the outermost grid point is chosen to be the ingoing light ray that hits the singularity at the center of the spike . in this way , the grid gets smaller as the feature that it needs to resolve shrinks .",
    "section 2 presents the equations and the characteristic numerical method .",
    "results are given in section 3 and conclusions in section 4 .",
    "the gowdy metric on @xmath7 takes the form @xmath11\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are functions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the vacuum einstein field equations split into `` evolution '' equations for @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath18 and `` constraint '' equations for @xmath19 @xmath20 \\label{lambdat } \\\\",

    "the constraint equations determine @xmath19 once @xmath16 and @xmath17 are known .",
    "the integrability conditions for the constraint equations are satisfied as a consequence of the evolution equations .",
    "since the evolution equations do not depend on @xmath19 there is essentially a complete decoupling of constraints from evolution equations .",
    "therefore , for the purposes of this paper we will treat only equations ( [ evolvep]-[evolveq ] ) . the only restriction that the constraints place on initial data for equations ( [ evolvep]-[evolveq ] ) is the following : since @xmath13 at @xmath22 is the same as @xmath13 at @xmath23 , it follows that the integral from @xmath24 to @xmath25 of the right hand side of equation ( [ lambdax ] ) must vanish .",
    "we require that this restriction is satisfied by the initial data for equations ( [ evolvep]-[evolveq ] ) and then these equations insure that the restriction is also satisfied at subsequent times .",
    "the singularity is at @xmath26 .",
    "it is often helpful to introduce the coordinate @xmath27 .",
    "thus the singularity is approached as @xmath28 . in terms of this coordinate ,",
    "the evolution equations ( [ evolvep]-[evolveq ] ) become @xmath29 the velocity is defined as @xmath30 . in the limit of large @xmath31 , if we neglect the terms in equations ( [ tauevolvep]-[tauevolveq ] ) proportional to @xmath32 then we find that @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 depends only on @xmath15 . however , if @xmath36 then neglect of the term @xmath37 is not justified .",
    "what happens is that if @xmath38 is greater than 1 , then this term drives it to values less than 1 , except at the isolated points where @xmath39 . at those points",
    "upward pointing spikes form .",
    "the previous studies @xcite suggest that if @xmath40 at the spike , the spike will persist , but that if @xmath41 at the spike , @xmath42 will become negative and its magnitude will start growing exponentially in @xmath31 as the spike narrows .",
    "but the previous studies leave open the question , `` what happens next ? ''",
    "we want to know the outcome .    for our purposes , we will need the field equations in characteristic form . to that end",
    "we introduce null coordinates @xmath43 and @xmath44 and characteristic variables @xmath45 and @xmath46 given by @xmath47",
    "the evolution equations ( [ evolvep]-[evolveq ] ) then become @xmath48 \\label{evolvea } \\\\ { b_{,w } } = { { ( u+w)}^{-1 } } [ c d + ( b - a)/2 ] \\label{constrainb } \\\\ { c_{,u}}= { { ( u+w)}^{-1 } }   [ - a d + ( c - d)/2 ] \\label{evolvec } \\\\ { d_{,w } } = { { ( u+w)}^{-1 } } [ - b c + ( d - c)/2 ] \\label{constraind}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we impose the condition that @xmath49 and @xmath50 are even functions of @xmath15 .",
    "this insures that @xmath51 and therefore that the spike will be at @xmath22 . with this condition",
    ", we only need to evolve on the domain @xmath52 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath53 .",
    "the characteristic initial value formulation for this system is as follows : on a @xmath54 surface we give as initial data @xmath55 and @xmath56 as functions of @xmath57",
    ". equations ( [ constrainb ] ) and ( [ constraind ] ) are then integrated to yield @xmath58 and @xmath46 on the initial data surface .",
    "the numerical method used is second order runge - kutta .",
    "the initial condition for this integration is that @xmath59 and @xmath60 at @xmath61 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are even functions of @xmath15 . now with @xmath62 and @xmath46 known on the initial surface , equations ( [ evolvea ] ) and ( [ evolvec ] ) can be regarded as odes for each value of @xmath57 . at each grid point , these odes are integrated to yield @xmath55 and @xmath56 at the next value of @xmath63 .",
    "the numerical method used is a second order predictor - corrector method .",
    "this entire process is iterated to produce the full evolution .",
    "we choose the minimum value of @xmath57 to be zero , corresponding to the light ray that will hit the singularity ( @xmath26 ) at the center of the spike ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath57 is the current value of @xmath63 , corresponding to @xmath22 .",
    "thus as the evolution proceeds , some grid points leave the physical domain and are no longer part of the evolution process . throughout , we choose @xmath64 .",
    "this means that we lose one grid point at each time step . when half of the grid points are lost , we put them back in between the remaining ones and interpolate @xmath55 and @xmath56 to obtain their values on the new grid points",
    ". thus we make the grid twice as fine . in this way , as the singularity is approached we always have enough grid points to resolve the ever narrowing spike .",
    "while our characteristic method ( c - code ) allows arbitrary initial data for @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( as long as the initial data does not determine a cauchy surface .",
    "] ) , it is helpful to make comparisons with codes using the usual cauchy methods .",
    "we therefore also use codes that evolve equations ( [ evolvep]-[evolveq ] ) ( t - code ) and equations ( [ tauevolvep]-[tauevolveq ] ) ( @xmath31-code ) .",
    "these codes use standard centered differences for spatial derivatives and the iterated crank - nicholson method @xcite ( icn ) for time evolution .",
    "we begin with cauchy data at @xmath65 and evolve using the t - code to @xmath66 . in the course of this evolution ,",
    "we obtain @xmath55 and @xmath56 on the null surface given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which we use as initial data for the c - code .",
    "spike in @xmath16 at @xmath69    spike in @xmath38 at @xmath69    to obtain solutions with high velocity spikes , we note that in the polarized case ( @xmath70 ) the velocity can take on any values .",
    "we therefore choose initial data with small @xmath17 .",
    "the form of the data is @xmath71 and @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are constants .",
    "figures [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] show the results of evolving these data . here",
    "@xmath75 and the result is produced by using the @xmath31-code and evolving to @xmath76 .",
    "now we take the same initial data and evolve it for a longer time , first using the t - code to generate the appropriate initial data for the c - code and then using the c - code to evolve very close to the singularity . the result for @xmath38",
    "_ vs _ @xmath31 at @xmath22 is shown in figure [ f3 ] . as the spike forms , @xmath77 .",
    "as the spike narrows , @xmath38 decreases , as predicted .",
    "note that @xmath38 at the spike starts out larger than 2 , and that it is eventually driven below 2 .",
    "@xmath38 at the spike ]    one might wonder what mechanism is responsible for driving the spike velocity below 2 . the answer comes from an examination of equation ( [ tauevolvep ] ) .",
    "rewriting this equation with @xmath42 on one side we have @xmath78 at the spike the term @xmath79 vanishes and the term @xmath80 is positive definite .",
    "the term @xmath81 is negative , since the spike in @xmath16 is upward pointing .",
    "what is happening is that the spike is becoming so narrow and thus @xmath82 is becoming so large that despite the smallness of @xmath83 the quantity @xmath81 is not negligible .",
    "the term @xmath80 is also not negligible , but its magnitude is less than the magnitude of @xmath81 , so @xmath42 is negative . in the explicit approximation , @xmath80 and @xmath81",
    "are decaying in magnitude if @xmath84 , but if @xmath41 and if @xmath85 does not vanish at the spike they are growing in magnitude , and the leading part of @xmath80 is half the magnitude of the leading part of @xmath81 , so the net effect is a decrease in @xmath42 @xcite . from figure [ f3 ]",
    "we see that this decrease eventually comes to an end while @xmath38 is still greater than 1 .",
    "now the conditions for the explicit approximation of the spike to be valid throughout the approach to the singularity are satisfied , indicating that the spike will persist .",
    "another family of initial data which we use to generate spikes is @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath72 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are constants , with @xmath90 .",
    "the constants are chosen so that the explicit approximation to the spike is initially valid , until the spike narrows enough that the velocity begins to slide down . to allow matching of the t - code to the c - code",

    "we vary @xmath73 , from @xmath100 to @xmath101 . in figure [ figrule ]",

    "after this slide the velocity is approximately constant , while @xmath38 `` bounces '' to a value equal in magnitude to @xmath104 , but now positive ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "this sort of bounce has been discussed in previous work @xcite and is driven by the term @xmath80 in the evolution equation for @xmath16 .",

    "each slide approximately satisfies the rule @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
