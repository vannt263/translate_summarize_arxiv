    "chlorine is an odd-@xmath2 element with low abundance in the solar photosphere and in meteorites .",
    "chlorine has no photospheric lines in the visible spectrum available for abundance analysis , though an infrared h@xmath3cl sunspot spectrum of @xcite gave @xmath4 ( abundances expressed on a logarithmic scale with @xmath1 ) . correcting this for the @xmath5cl/@xmath3cl isotope ratio (= 1/3 ) gives @xmath6 .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath7 has been deduced by @xcite from the near - infrared ( 8375   ) photospheric line .",
    "@xcite comment that the cl abundance estimate of @xmath8 @xcite from regions may be more reliable as a solar abundance than direct solar measurements .",
    "chlorine abundances from interstellar medium lines to nearby stars range from 5.5 to 5.7 @xcite .",
    "lines occur in the solar ultraviolet spectrum , with that at 1351.7    anomalously strong through pumping by the 1335    line @xcite , while @xcite have identified cl in ionization stages from to in sumer spectra .",
    "the very low intensities of these lines are unlikely to lead to a reliable determination of the quiet - sun corona cl abundance .",
    "h - like and he - like cl ( and ) x - ray emission lines occur in solar flare spectra near 4   . a scan of the _ solar maximum mission _ flat crystal spectrometer ( fcs ) over a very weak feature identified as the resonance line ( 4.444   ) and a nearby line at 4.299    during a powerful ( class x1.4 ) flare in 1988 ( discussed by @xcite ) gave the cl / s abundance ratio equal to @xmath9  % , or ( with @xcite s s abundance ) @xmath10 . this is significantly higher than the estimates of @xcite or @xcite .",
    "this paper reports on the observation of lines with the resik ( rentgenovsky spektrometr s izognutymi kristalami ; @xcite ) crystal spectrometer on the _ coronas - f _ spacecraft during 20 solar flares , from which it has been possible to determine much more definitively the cl abundance for flare plasmas .",
    "the detection of the lines has already been reported in an earlier version of the present work @xcite based on a smaller sample of resik data .",
    "the resonance line and nearby intercombination and forbidden lines are weak but with the much higher sensitivity of resik than the fcs and other flat - crystal instruments the lines can be distinguished fairly well in flare spectra over a large temperature range , and from the measured line fluxes together with the assumption of an isothermal plasma estimates of the chlorine abundance made .",
    "these are compared with those of other authors , and the relevance to the widely discussed first ionization potential ( fip ) dependence of coronal abundances discussed .",
    "the instrumental details of resik , which operated for nearly 2 years from spacecraft launch on 2001 july  31 , have been given elsewhere @xcite . in summary , resik had combinations of four curved crystals and position - sensitive proportional counter arranged in pairs .",
    "there were no collimators in order to maximize the instrument s sensitivity .",
    "photon counts in each spectral range were accumulated in data gathering intervals ( dgi ) that were fixed at 10  s for the initial few months of the mission , but for most of the period analyzed here the dgis varied from 2  s at the peaks of strong flares to about 5  minutes when activity was low .",
    "the total spectral range was 3.36.1   .",
    "the lines between 4.444    and 4.497    discussed here occur within resik s channel  3 ( range 4.324.86   ) .",
    "channel  3 also includes the ly-@xmath11 line at 4.729    which features strongly at @xmath12  mk .",
    "the diffracting crystal for channel  3 was quartz ( @xmath13 ) , and the spectral resolution 12  m .",
    "post - launch sensitivity calculations , discussed at length by @xcite , enable absolute fluxes of spectral lines to be determined to @xmath14% precision .",
    "a background flux due to fluorescence was found from 32-bin pulse height analyzer data , from which peaks due to solar and fluorescence counts can be distinguished . by fitting gaussian distributions to the peaks ,",
    "the fluorescence background was found to be negligible for channels  1 and 2 and approximately estimated and subtracted from spectra in channels  3 and 4 .    in previous analyses of resik ar and",
    "k line spectra and continua emitted at flare temperatures @xcite , an isothermal emitting plasma with temperature and emission measure given by _",

    "however , this assumption ceases to be a good approximation for lower - temperature emission , e.g. that observed by resik in quiet sun conditions , for which a differential emission measure technique was used instead @xcite . as the contribution functions @xmath15 , defining the emission per unit emission measure @xmath16 of the emitting plasma ( @xmath17 electron density , @xmath18 the emitting volume ) of lines peak at @xmath19  mk , comparable to the corresponding temperatures for , , or lines , an isothermal approximation was again used , with temperatures ( called here @xmath20 ) and emission measures ( @xmath21 ) taken from the ratio of the emission in the two x - ray channels of _ goes _ using a coronal set of abundances @xcite .",
    "it was not possible to use satellite line ratios for the temperature as at the resik spectral resolution the satellites are blended with the lines . as was discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite and will be discussed further here , use of the _ goes _ ratios appears to be a valid assumption for our purposes .",
    "a total of 2795 resik spectra were analyzed , taken during 20 flares from 2002 august  3 to 2003 february  22 .",
    "a list of the observations was given by @xcite .",
    "a convenient display of the entire set of observed spectra obtained during the _ coronas - f _ mission lifetime is formed by stacking the spectra on a common wavelength scale , arranging them in order of @xmath20 determined at the midpoint time over which each spectrum was accumulated , colors or a gray - scale indicating the intensity of the emission .",
    "such displays were given by @xcite and @xcite for channels  1 and 2 respectively .",
    "figure  [ chan3_stacked_spectra ] ( left panel ) shows in the same manner all resik spectra in channel  3 which includes the lines .",
    "an averaged spectrum in this range over the entire period is shown above the stacked spectra , with the principal spectral lines indicated . owing to the low abundance of cl ,",
    "the lines are very weak , so a portion of the display around their wavelengths and the feature at 4.39    made up of dielectronic satellite lines ( transitions @xmath22 ) is shown in the right panel of figure  [ chan3_stacked_spectra ] , with an intensity scaling that shows the lines more clearly .",
    "details of the lines are given in table  [ cl_line_data ] .",
    "a computer program was written to synthesize the spectral region 4.384.58    containing the lines as a function of temperature @xmath23 and emission measure @xmath16 so that comparison could be made with resik spectra at particular values of the observed temperature @xmath20 .",
    "we used the chianti database for the line fluxes of the lines .",
    "the chianti collisional excitation data for the lines are interpolated using data from various sources for he - like ions with atomic numbers similar to cl .",
    "data for dielectronic satellites , the fluxes of which are important at temperatures @xmath24  mk , are not included in chianti .",
    "the satellites of interest have transitions @xmath25 ( @xmath26 representing the non - participating or spectator electron ) , and are excited by dielectronic recombination of the he - like ion cl@xmath27 and , for satellites in the @xmath28 array , by inner - shell excitation of the li - like ion cl@xmath29 .",
    "only a few dielectronically formed satellites are important individually , but calculations need to be done for a fairly large range of satellites as the cumulative effect of satellites with high values of @xmath30 is significant in adding to the intensities of lines @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the flux of a dielectronically formed satellite emitted by a plasma with temperature @xmath23 and emission measure @xmath16 at the distance of the earth ( 1  au ) is given by    @xmath33    [ sat_line ]    where the ion fractions @xmath34 as a function of @xmath23 were taken from @xcite ; these are negligibly different from those of @xcite which are the default set in chianti .",

    "the satellite intensity factor @xmath36 is a function of autoionization and radiative rates from the upper level , and the excitation energy @xmath37 is with respect to the ground level of the he - like ion .",
    "the satellite wavelengths and @xmath36 values were calculated from the @xcite hartree  fock atomic code with pseudo - relativistic corrections ( hfr ) , adapted for small personal computers ( a. kramida 2008 , private communication ) .",
    "a total of 207 transitions were considered with spectator electrons with @xmath26 up to @xmath38 . as in previous runs of this code ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", we used 100% scaling factors for the slater parameters in the hfr code .",
    "the satellite wavelengths generally need small adjustments to bring them into agreement with observed values",

    "the neighboring free  free and free  bound continua were calculated from chianti routines .",
    "the free  bound continuum calculation requires a set of abundances , notably si , fe , mg , and o. in an analysis of four x - ray continuum bands observed by resik @xcite , it was found that a coronal set of abundances ( @xcite , given in the chianti database as the file sun@xmath72corona@xmath72ext.abund ) fitted the resik continuum fluxes better ( by a factor 2 ) than photospheric abundances .",
    "we therefore used this coronal set in the present analysis .",
    "there is a slight danger here of a circular argument since the spectrum will be used ( section  [ abundance_of_cl ] ) to derive the cl abundance , and the result could be affected if cl makes a significant contribution to the free  bound continuum .",
    "however , the chianti calculations show that this contribution is negligible .",
    "this synthetic spectrum program was then used to calculate spectra with temperature and emission measure as input .",
    "these are compared with resik spectra in figure  [ clxvi_spectra ] .",
    "the left panel shows the sum of all resik channel  3 spectra taken over all flares observed , and shows that , despite the weakness of the emission , the three main line features are evident .",
    "the right panel shows four resik channel  3 spectra in the 4.424.54    range , including the lines , for different values of @xmath20 ( indicated in each plot ) .",
    "calculated spectra from the spectral synthesis program are shown in each case ( by red continuous lines in the color version of the journal ) , with temperatures equal to 9  mk for the summed spectra ( left panel ) and equal to values of @xmath20 ( right panel ) for the others .",
    "the line profiles of the calculated spectra are defined by thermal doppler broadening appropriate to each temperature ( e.g. fwhm @xmath73  m  for a temperature of 9  mk ) . as can be seen",
    ", the weakness of the lines makes the comparison somewhat difficult , particularly at lower temperatures , but there is no doubt that the chief features corresponding to the @xmath31 , @xmath74 , and @xmath47 lines are present .    the synthetic spectrum program was also used to reproduce the flare spectrum from the _ smm _ flat crystal spectrometer discussed by @xcite using the _ goes _ temperature and emission measure at the time when the lines were scanned .",
    "the theoretical and observed @xmath31 line flux agree to @xmath14  % .",
    "this confirms our previous analyses of resik spectra that , in lieu of more precise temperature - determining means such as dielectronic satellite ratios ( satellites are not resolved at the resolution of resik ) , _ goes _ temperatures and emission measures accurately represent the spectra discussed here .",
    "following procedures used for k and ar @xcite , the observed line emission for all spectra were compared with the summed contribution functions @xmath15 for these lines . for each spectrum we measured the total emission @xmath75 ( in photons @xmath76",
    "s@xmath41 ) above a neighboring pedestal level in the 4.434.505    band , which includes the @xmath31 , @xmath74 , and @xmath47 lines and nearby satellites .",
    "a plot of the values of @xmath77 ( where @xmath21 is in units of @xmath78  @xmath79 ) against @xmath20 for all spectra is shown as points in figure  [ g_of_t_cl_xvi ] ( left panel ) together with the theoretical @xmath15 ( continuous curve ) , calculated from the synthetic spectrum program using @xmath80 @xcite and 2 and 4 times this value .",
    "the total scatter in the points covers a range of nearly a factor 30 , reflecting the weakness of the lines in resik spectra over the 421  mk temperature range that the lines are discernible .",
    "the scatter is comparable to our results from similarly weak lines @xcite in resik channel  1 but is greater than those from the much stronger lines in channel  2 @xcite .",
    "it is clear , nevertheless , that the cluster of points , while following the trend with temperature of the theoretical curve ( steep rise at low temperatures , maximizing at @xmath81  mk ) , mostly fall above it . a chlorine abundance greater than that given by @xcite is therefore indicated .",
    "the abundance of cl can be estimated from each resik spectrum using figure  [ g_of_t_cl_xvi ] ( left panel ) by taking the abundance to be @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the cl abundance of @xcite and the correcting factor @xmath84 for the @xmath85th spectrum is evaluated from    @xmath86    where @xmath75 is the total flux of the lines and satellites and the contribution function @xmath87 is evaluated for temperature @xmath20 and the cl abundance of @xcite .",
    "the distribution of all @xmath88 measured values in bins of 0.1 in the logarithm of abundance is shown in figure  [ g_of_t_cl_xvi ] ( right panel ) .",
    "the peak of a best - fit gaussian distribution is at @xmath89 , with width ( fwhm ) range 5.446.06 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath90 uncertainty is 0.26 .",
    "the large number of resik channel  3 spectra obtained over the lifetime of the mission has enabled the abundance of chlorine to be determined from the lines in the 4.444.50    range .",
    "the value from the lines is @xmath91 , the uncertainty being based on the scatter of the 2795 observational points .",
    "this is a factor of 1.8 higher than the abundance determined from the infrared sunspot spectrum by @xcite and a factor 2.7 higher than that from regions @xcite which @xcite consider may be a solar cl abundance proxy .    according to @xcite , elements with low ( @xmath92  ev ) fip appear to have coronal abundances that are enhanced over photospheric abundances by a factor @xmath93 , the so - called fip effect .",
    "the first ionization potential of cl is 12.97  ev @xcite , so is by this definition a high - fip element and is not expected to be enhanced in the corona .",
    "however , the value obtained here from a sample of flares appears to be a factor of almost 2 higher than the sunspot abundance of @xcite , against expectation of the fip effect for other elements .",
    "although abundance determinations from individual spectra have some scatter ( figure  [ g_of_t_cl_xvi ] , left panel ) , the distribution of the determinations ( figure  [ g_of_t_cl_xvi ] , right panel ) has a width sufficiently small to suggest consistency arguing for the constancy of @xmath94 with time .",
    "this was also found to be the case , based on the same data sample , for k ( with similar uncertainties to those for cl : @xcite ) but more particularly for ar , having only @xmath14% uncertainties @xcite .",
    "if indeed there is a fractionation process that separates ions from neutrals at some low level in the solar atmosphere giving rise to the fip effect , the process appears to be a steady one and not particularly dependent on the occurrence of flares or of their importance : the flares used in the analysis here range in importance from below c1 to x1 ( see list in @xcite ) , a factor of over 100 in soft x - ray output .",
