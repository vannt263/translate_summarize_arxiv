    "the b - v colour difference between young and evolved bars is 0.4 mag , which can be translated to an age difference of 10 gyr .",
    "this means that bars can be robust structures , in agreement with recent @xmath0-body simulations and observations of barred galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "the young bars in our sample have an average length of 5.4@xmath11.6 kpc , while the evolved bars have an average length of 7.5@xmath11.2 kpc , consistent with recent theoretical expectations that bars grow longer while aging .",
    "young bars are preferentially found in late - type spirals , indicating that bar recurrence may be more frequent in gas - rich , disk - dominated galaxies .",
    "we also found that agn are preferentially hosted by galaxies with young bars , suggesting that the fueling of agn by bars happens in short timescales and that a clearer bar - agn connection would be found in a sample of galaxies with young bars .",
    "we have also found that bar colours might be used as a proxy for bar ages .",
    "enlarging the sample of bars with measured ages is paramount to calibrate this relation , confirm these results , compare in more detail observations and models , and better understand secular evolution .",

    "<S> in an effort to obtain further observational evidences for secular evolution processes in galaxies , as well as observational constraints to current theoretical models of secular evolution , we have used bvri and ks images of a sample of 18 barred galaxies to measure the lengths and colours of bars , create colour maps and estimate global colour gradients . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , applying a method we developed in a previous article , we could distinguish for 7 galaxies in our sample those whose bars have been recently formed from the ones with already evolved bars . </S>",
    "<S> we estimated an average difference in the optical colours between young and evolved bars that may be translated to an age difference of the order of 10 gyr , meaning that bars may be long standing structures . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our results show that , on average , evolved bars are longer than young bars . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to indicate that , during its evolution , a bar grows longer by capturing stars from the disk , in agreement with recent numerical and analytical results . </S>"
