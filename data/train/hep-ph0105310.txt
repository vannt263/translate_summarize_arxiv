    "the theoretical analysis of the masses and mixings of the light pseudoscalar and vector mesons has a long history , from the original gell - mann  okubo mass formula @xcite through modern analyses based on chiral perturbation theory as summarized , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the masses of the light pseudoscalar mesons are now discussed in terms of the breaking of the chiral @xmath2 symmetry that exists in qcd for massless quarks , with the octet mesons appearing initially as the eight goldstone bosons for the broken symmetry .",
    "the su(3 ) singlet state @xmath3 and the vector mesons are treated separately .    a perturbative treatment of the effect of quark masses on the pseudoscalar mesons , introduced through the quark mass matrix @xmath4 leads to the prediction that @xcite @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the average light - quark mass , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the masses of the unmixed su(3 ) isospin-0 octet and singlet states @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 is an unknown dynamical matrix element , and @xmath13 is the original mass of the @xmath14 , also unknown . finally , the original states @xmath10 and @xmath11 couple through an off diagonal matrix element @xmath15 to produce the observed mass eigenstates @xmath16(547 ) and @xmath17(958 ) @xcite .",
    "the perturbative predictions are reasonably successful .",
    "equation ( [ perturbative_masses ] ) contains the gell - mann  okubo mass relation @xmath18 which is valid to about 20% when the @xmath19 is identified with the @xmath20 . the @xmath20-@xmath1 mixing angle defined by @xmath21",
    "is predicted to be @xmath22 @xcite , at the edge of the range @xmath23 to @xmath24 obtained in various fits to decay data , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the situation is different for the vector mesons , where the chiral symmetry arguments do not apply .",
    "however , symmetry ideas from su(6 ) and quark - model and similar methods again lead to successful mass relations among the vector mesons , while dynamical ideas related to annihilation processes have been invoked to explain the different mixing patterns @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "i present a simple structural analysis of the mass and mixing problems for the nonets of pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "most of the ideas appear in the literature as applied to specific problems , and most of the results are also familiar .",
    "however , by introducing some quark - mass effects which modify previous approaches and lead naturally to mass matrices of the most general type @xcite , i find a consistent overall picture in which , for example , the different mass and mixing patterns for the pseudoscalar and vector mesons follow from physical input , and the ratios of dynamical matrix elements in the two multiplets give information on the mixings .",
    "i first treat the pseudoscalar nonet , with the @xmath1 included from the outset .",
    "i then treat the vector nonet , and comment on the connections and differences , and conclude with a few overall remarks .",
    "in this section , i discuss a generalized version of the mass matrix which allows actual fits to the masses of the pseudoscalar mesons . it will be useful to start in a `` quark model '' basis of effective meson fields @xmath26 and meson states @xmath27 , where @xmath28 label the flavor structure in a @xmath29 description of a flavor su(3 ) .",
    "the general basis includes both the su(3 ) octet and singlet states .",
    "the mass operator for the pseudoscalar mesons is then of the form @xmath30 i will work throughout with the matrix @xmath31 , and will first consider the neutral sector .    the combinations @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for the flavor labels @xmath28 are completely equivalent for massless quarks in qcd , so , with a suitable choice of phases , the initial mass matrix for the neutral states must have the same entry in every location corresponding to an su(3 ) singlet configuration , @xmath35 the factor @xmath12 in the second form has been extracted for convenience in writing later equations .",
    "@xmath36 has eigenvalues zero in the su(3 ) octet states @xmath37 and @xmath10 , or any combination thereof , and the eigenvalue @xmath38 for the su(3 ) singlet @xmath11 .",

    "the structure changes in the presence of quark masses , both through the addition of diagonal contributions proportional to the quark masses , and through the effect of those masses on the annihilation terms .",
    "the effect of the latter is neglected in all discussions of which i am aware .",

    "was apparently first suggested by isgur @xcite , but without the @xmath41 terms .",
    "isgur identified what are here the @xmath42 terms with the annihilation diagrams , treated the diagonal terms phenomenologically as effective quark masses , and used the structure to explain the difference between the @xmath43 and @xmath44 mixings .",

    "] i expect @xmath41 to be small , with @xmath45 .",
    "a dispersion relation argument shows that the annihilation contribution to @xmath46 is positive in the symmetrical limit .",

    ", the off - diagonal contributions proportional to @xmath47 can be complex , with @xmath48 still hermitian .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath41 should be small , and can be absorbed to first order in a change in the phase of @xmath11 .",
    "i will therefore take @xmath41 as real . ]",
    "the light quark masses are also small , @xmath49 .    a transformation to the su(3 ) basis gives a considerably less transparent structure .",
    "the resulting matrix can be simplified by dropping a diagonal term proportional to @xmath50 and off - diagonal terms which involve @xmath51 . both are small , with @xmath52 .",
    "the off - diagonal terms induce a small mixing of the @xmath53 with the @xmath20 and @xmath1 , but first contribute to the physical masses in second order @xcite .",
    "the reduced matrix is @xmath54 where @xmath6 and @xmath55 .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite this as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the 3@xmath583 unit matrix , @xmath59 is the 1@xmath582 null matrix , and @xmath60 is the @xmath612 matrix @xmath62 the matrix @xmath63 contributes a term @xmath64 to each of the eigenvalues of @xmath65 .",

    "this difference can arise from higher order effects in the chiral expansion , loop corrections , or the change in matrix elements expected in the change from a system with one heavy quark to systems which can have two .",

    "the sum gives @xmath171 , in good agreement with experiment .",
    "however , i find little reason to use the su(3 ) description . the inequality @xmath172 picks out the `` @xmath0 '' basis states @xmath173 as giving the natural description of the problem , with the @xmath111 split off in the isospin triplet substate .",

    "the su(3 ) basis is therefore somewhat better physically .",
    "in contrast , given the result @xmath175 for the pseudoscalars , there is a clear physical argument that @xmath182 , so that the @xmath177 basis is preferred for the vectors , with the mixing small corresponding to `` ideal '' mixing in the su(3 ) basis .",
    "my conclusions are simple : there is a substantial advantage in treating the nonets of pseudoscalar and vector meson together in analyzing the patterns of masses and mixings .",

    "most of the results presented here are well - known , though not treated as a whole in other discussions .",
    "however , the complete analysis given here introduces a new feature through the through the inclusion of the leading quark mass corrections to the annihilation diagrams in fig .",
    "this leads to the general mass matrix for the pseudoscalar mesons in eq .",

    "i show in the case of the pseudoscalar mesons that the physical @xmath20 and @xmath1 masses can only be fitted if the annihilation parameter @xmath41 in the mass matrix is nonzero and negative .",
    "the wide splitting of the @xmath184 , @xmath20 , and @xmath1 masses , and fairly large mixing angle @xmath98 for the pseudoscalars , reflect the fact that the strange - quark mass insertion @xmath80 and the basic su(3 ) singlet term @xmath42 are similar in magnitude .",
    "the situation is much simpler for the vector mesons . while the initial mass matrix has the same formal structure as that for the pseudoscalar mesons , the large anomalous contribution to the singlet component of the latter is missing , and the annihilation diagram is suppressed by the necessity of having at least three gluons in the intermediate state . as a result , the parameter @xmath120 analogous to @xmath46",
    "is expected to be small in qcd , with @xmath185 , and the mass matrix simplifies .",
    "the smallness of @xmath120 leads to the near - degeneracy of the @xmath111 and @xmath112 masses , and to the small mixing of the @xmath112 and @xmath113 mesons in the natural @xmath0 basis .",
    "finally , i show that the ratio of the matrix elements @xmath12 and @xmath186 for the pseudoscalar and vector mesons is close to one , as expected . by calculating the ratio two ways , i find that overall consistency is obtained for @xmath109 and scale factors @xmath187 .",
    "the latter parametrize the higher order mass and loop corrections which differ for the @xmath188 and the @xmath43 or @xmath44 sectors .",
    "the @xmath43 mixing angle in the usual su(3 ) basis is then predicted to be @xmath159 .",
