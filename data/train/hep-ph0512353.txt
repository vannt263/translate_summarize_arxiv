    "a measure of the complexity of quantum scattering in terms of tsallis - like entropies is proposed .",
    "the results on the experimental tests of _ the pmd - sqs - optimality _ , as well as on the _ _  complexity _ _ , obtained by using the experimental pion - nucleon pion - nucleus phase shifts _ _ , _ _ are presented .",

    "in the last time many authors have developed and commented on the multiplicity and variety of definitions of _ complexity ( c ) _ in the scientific literature ( see ref.[5 ] and references therein ) .",
    "what is the _ complexity _ of an interacting system ? in general complexity is a concept very difficult to be defined . if we consider that this notion is coming from the original latin word _",
    "complexus _ , which signifies ",
    "_ entwined _  ,  _ twisted together _ ",
    "then this may interpreted in the following way : in order to have a complex system you need two or more distinct components , which are joined in such a way that it is difficult to separate them .",
    "if we look in the oxford dictionary we find that _ something is defined as complex if it is  made of closely connected parts  .",
    "_ so , in these definitions we find the basic duality between parts which are at the same time distinct and connected .",
    "this implies that : a system would be more complex if more parts could be distinguished , and if more connections between them exist .",
    "so , the aspects of _ distinction _ and _ connections _ between the parts of systems determine two dimensions characterizing complexity .",
    "distinction corresponds to the fact that different parts of the complex behaves differently while connections correspond to constrains .",
    "moreover , the _ distinction _ leads at the limits to _ disorder _",
    "@xmath13 or chaos , while the _ connection _ leads to order @xmath14 complexity can only exist if both aspects are present : neither perfect disorder nor perfect order are complex . before of a precise mathematical definition of the _ complexity measure ( c ) _ it is useful to point out some intuitive _ _  _ _ properties of the _ complexity _ of the physical systems [ 5 ] .",
    "these are as follows :    \\(a ) any reasonable _ _",
    "measure of complexity must vanish for the complete ordered _ _ or _",
    "complete disordered states of the system ; _",
    "\\(b ) any _ _  complexity must be an universal physical quantity__@xmath15that is , it is applied to any dynamical system ;    \\(c ) any _ complexity must correspond to mathematical complexity in problem solving_.    current definitions may be divided into three distinct categories according to the following essential feature :  ( a ) definitions which take _ complexity _ as _ monotonically increasing function _ of _ _ disorder ( _ _ @xmath16 ) ; ( b ) complexity defined as a _",
    "convex function _ of _ disorder _ _ _ ( _ _ @xmath16 ) ; complexity defined as _ monotonically increasing function _ of _ order _ _ _ ( _ _ @xmath17 ) .",
    "since we will express our _ complexity measure ( c ) _ in terms of _ _ disorder ( _ _ @xmath16 ) , or of _ order _ ( @xmath18 ) , we start with the definitions [ 5 ] @xmath19 where s is the boltzmann - gibs - shannon ( bgs ) entropy @xmath20 where p@xmath21 is the probability of i - state of the n states available to the system ( the boltzmann constant k is taken k=1 ) . in the simplest case of an isolated system",
    ", the maximum entropy occurs to the equiprobable distribution @xmath22 @xmath23 yielding @xmath24    all categories of _ complexity measures _ can be included by defining a measure of the form [ 5 ] @xmath25 so , the _ complexity measures _ of category i and iii correspond to the particular cases : @xmath26 , @xmath27and @xmath28 the category ii is obtained when both @xmath26 and @xmath29 then , the complexity measures @xmath30 vanishes at zero _ disorder _ and zero _ order , _ and has the maximum @xmath31",
    "therefore , in order to introduce a measure of complexity of the hadronic system of quantum states produced in hadronic scatterings we must define the _ _ disorder ( _ _ @xmath16 ) , or _ order _ ( @xmath32 ) for the hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "these physical quantities can be defined just as in eqs ( 1)-(2 ) by using the scattering boltzman - gibs - like entropy [ 2 ] or more general tsallis - like scattering entropies introduced by us in refs . [",
    "for completeness we start our discussion with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath35 $ ] , as the scattering helicity amplitudes of _ meson - nucleon scattering _    @xmath36    where @xmath37 being the c.m .",
    "scattering angle .",
    "the normalization of the helicity amplitudes @xmath33 and @xmath38 is chosen such that the c.m .",
    "differential cross section @xmath39 is given by    @xmath40    since we will work at fixed energy , the dependence of @xmath41 and,@xmath42 and of @xmath43 , on this variable was suppressed .",
    "hence , the helicities of incoming and outgoing nucleons are denoted by @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and was written as ( + ) , ( - ) , corresponding to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively . in terms of the partial waves amplitudes @xmath48 and @xmath49 we have @xmath50 where the d@xmath51-rotation functions are given by    @xmath52 ^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left [ \\stackrel{\\circ } { p}_{l+1}(x)-\\stackrel{\\circ } { % p}_{l}(x)\\right ]   \\label{9}\\ ] ]    @xmath53 ^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left [ \\stackrel{\\circ } { p}_{l+1}(x)+\\stackrel{\\circ } { % p}_{l}(x)\\right ]   \\label{10}\\ ] ]    @xmath54 are legendre polynomials and prime indicates differentiation with respect to x @xmath55 .",

    "@xmath95 are given by eqs .",
    "( 23)-(24 ) .",
    "all these results together other are presented in table 1",
    "now , let us apply the definitions ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) of the _ _  disorder , order , _ _ and _ _  complexity measure _ _ to the nonextensive quantum scattering of the elementary particles .",
    "then , we define the scattering ( @xmath96)@xmath15__disorders _ _ _ _  _ _ as follows    @xmath97    and the corresponding scattering ( @xmath98)@xmath15__orders _ _ by the relations @xmath99 where @xmath100 are the scattering _ tsallis - like scattering entropies _ defined in section 3 .    therefore , using eqs .",
    "( 29)-(30 ) and ( 12)-(15 ) we can calculate the__scattering complexities _ _ @xmath101 defined as follows @xmath102",
    "now , for a systematic experimental investigation of the saturation of the _ optimality limits in hadron - hadron scattering _ is necessary to use the formulas from the table 1 and the available experimental phase - shifts [ 8 - 10 ] to solve the following numerical problems : ( i ) to reconstruct the experimental pion - nucleon , kaon - nucleon and antikaon - nucleon scattering amplitudes ; ( ii ) to obtain numerical values of the experimental scattering entropies @xmath103 @xmath104 from the reconstructed amplitudes ; ( iii ) to obtain the numerical values of the _ _ optimal angular momentum j__@xmath105 from experimental scattering amplitudes and to calculate the numerical values for the pmd - sqs - optimal entropies @xmath106 @xmath107 ( iv ) to obtain numerical values for @xmath108 or / and @xmath109-_test functions _ given by @xmath110_{i}-[s_{x}^{o1}(k)]_{i}}{[\\delta s_{x}^{o1}]_{i}}\\right ] ^{2},\\quad x\\equiv j,\\theta ; \\stackrel{-}{j\\theta } \\;\\;k\\equiv p , q \\label{32}\\ ] ] where @xmath111_{j_{o}+1}-[s_{x}^{o1}(k)]_{j_{o}-1}| \\label{33}\\ ] ] are the values of the @xmath112__optimal entropies _ _",
    "@xmath113_{j_{o}\\pm 1}$ ] calculated with the optimal angular momenta @xmath114 respectively .",
    "this procedure is equivalent with assumption of an error of @xmath115 in estimation of the experimental values of the optimal angular momentum @xmath116 the results obtained in this way are presented in the figs . 1 and tables 2 - 4 .",
    "so , the best fit is obtained ( see tables 2 ) for the correlated pairs @xmath117 and @xmath118 with the values of @xmath119 in the range @xmath120 @xmath121 and @xmath122.0 .",
    "however , at this level of error analysis the case of the extensive system ( p = q=1 ) of quantum scattering states is also consistent with the experimental data while the pair of nonextensivities ( p=3.0,q=0.6 ) rejected by the values of @xmath123test function ( see table 4 ) .",
    "moreover , in fig . 2 - 3 we presented the numerical results for the _ complexity of the j - quantum systems of states _ produced in the pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "so , the experimental values of the complexities @xmath124 for @xmath125 and @xmath126scatterings , obtained from the available experimental phase - shifts [ 19 ] , are compared with the _ pmd - sqs - optimal state _ predictions ( full curve [ @xmath127^{o1}=0 $ ] ) . in all cases , the error - bands ( the grey regions ) around the optimality curves",
    "are calculated by assuming an error of @xmath115 in calculation of the optimal angular momentum j@xmath105 from the results of the figs.2 - 3 we conclude that the scattering complexities @xmath124 are in excellent agreement with the optimal complexities [ @xmath127^{o1}=0 $ ] .",
    "so , a _ principle of minimum complexity in hadronic interaction _ is suggested with high accuracy ( @xmath5 ) by the experimental pion - nucleon scattering data .",
    "in this paper , by using _ _ the optimality [ _ _ 1 - 4 _ ] and _ @xmath6 , @xmath3$]-tsallis - like entropies , the _ complexity _ and nonextensivity of the [ @xmath0 and @xmath1-quantum states produced in hadronic scatterings are investigated .",
    "the main results and conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * using the available experimental phase shifts analysis we calculated the numerical values for the [ @xmath128 , @xmath129-_tsallis - like scattering entropies _ for the pure isospin @xmath130scattering states : [ @xmath131 ; @xmath132 ; @xmath133 ; * we presented strong experimental evidence for the _ saturation of the _ @xmath134-$]__pmd - sqs optimal limits _",
    "_ for all nonextensive ( @xmath0 , @xmath63)-statistical ensembles of quantum states produced in hadron - hadron scattering ( see fig.1 and table 2 ) .",
    "these results allow to conclude that the @xmath135$]-_quantum _ _ system _ and @xmath136$]-_quantum _ _ system _ are produced at `` _ _ equilibrium _ _ '' but with the @xmath137-$ ] conjugated nonextensivities @xmath138 and @xmath122 in all investigated isospin scattering states : [ @xmath139 $ ] .",
    "so the  geometric origin  of the nonextensivities p and q ( as dimensions of the hilbert spaces @xmath140 and @xmath141 as well as their correlations are experimentally confirmed with high accuracy ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the strong experimental evidence obtained here for the _ nonextensive statistical behavior _ of the @xmath142 quantum scatterings states in the pion - nucleon , kaon - nucleon and antikaon - nucleon scatterings can be interpreted as an indirect manifestation of _ the presence of the quarks and gluons _ as fundamental constituents of the scattering system having the strong - coupling long - range regime required by the quantum chromodynamics .",
    "* we presented strong experimental evidence fo the validity of _ a principle of minimum complexity ( pmc ) in pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "pmc _ is supported with high accuracy ( @xmath5 ) by all the experimental data especially at energies higher than 2 gev beyond the resonance region .",
    "finally , we note that further investigations are needed since this _ saturation of optimality and complexity limits _ as well as _ nonextensive statistical behavior _ of the quantum scattering , evidentiated here with high accuracy @xmath143 , can be a signature for a _ new universal law _ of the quantum scattering .",
