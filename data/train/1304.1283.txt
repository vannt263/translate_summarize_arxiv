    "the study of heat transport through small - scale quantum systems has recently attracted considerable interest due to an increasing demand for an understanding of the fundamental limit and efficiency of energy harvesting from a thermal machine at the quantum level @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental physical quantities considered in this subject is the heat current in the ( non - equilibrium ) steady state flowing from a hot bath through the quantum object of interest to a cold bath .",
    "the steady - state heat flux has been believed , for a long while , to obey fourier s law of heat conduction stating that the heat flux is proportional to the gradient of temperature along its path , explicitly expressed as @xmath6 @xcite ; here the proportional constant @xmath7 denotes the heat conductivity of the system in consideration , which is , typically for bulk materials , independent of the system size @xmath0 and its shape , so giving rise to @xmath8 . in their seminal work , however , rieder et al . discovered @xcite that the steady - state heat flux through a one - dimensional classical harmonic chain is given by @xmath9 and so independent of the chain length ( representing a novel form of energy flow ) , which accordingly deviates from fourier s law . since then",
    ", the validity ( or not ) of fourier s law has come under scrutiny in various classical ( e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) and quantum systems ( e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) . over the last few decades , in fact , it has turned out that fourier s law may be violated in low - dimensional lattices whereas there is evidence that fourier s law is still valid even for some one - dimensional classical and quantum systems .",
    "therefore it remains an open question to rigorously determine the system - size dependence of the heat current .",
    "the rigorous analysis of heat transport through a small - scale quantum object has been carried out more recently @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting works is , e.g. , the study , given in @xcite , of steady - state heat current through a disordered harmonic chain coupled to two baths at different temperatures , which was discussed mainly numerically , but giving rise to no clear conclusion regarding the system - size dependence of the heat current .",
    "next , there was another interesting analytical treatment of this topic by asadian _",
    "et al . _ , given in @xcite , with a concrete conclusion that the heat current is independent of the system size accordingly violating fourier s law of heat conduction .",
    "this was explicitly discussed in a harmonic chain coupled to baths as well as in a chain of two - level systems coupled to baths . in this treatment , they applied the lindblad master equation formalism ( within the born - markov approximation ) as well as the rotating wave approximation neglecting all energy non - conserving terms induced by the intra - coupling and so considering only the hopping of a single excitation between two nearest neighboring chain elements .",
    "as such , their analysis is restricted to the weak - coupling regime both in the chain - bath coupling and in the intra - coupling , as is typically the case for most studies .",
    "accordingly , no sufficiently large energy flow can be anticipated to obtain .",
    "in addition , they demonstrated interestingly that fourier s law can be recovered with chain length @xmath10 by adding , into the original lindblad master equation , a superoperator representing the ( phonon - induced ) dephasing appearing in the condensed matter system .",
    "needless to say , however , this additional dephasing lindbladian can not be derived from the original hamiltonian describing the coupled chain plus baths under our current consideration .",
    "therefore we are now demanded to study the steady - state heat flux beyond the weak - coupling regime , which has so far remained extensively unexplored . by looking into this problem",
    ", it is possible to examine behaviors of the heat flow relative to the coupling strengths as control parameters .",
    "this examination could stimulate the possibilities for increasing the efficiency of energy harvesting by providing the amplified heat flow followed by some additional novel quantum control of thermodynamic processes .",
    "in fact , the effects of dissipative environments due to the system - bath coupling , which are normally negligible in macroscopic systems , become `` detrimental '' to low - dimensional quantum objects , and so the resultant noise is a major challenging factor to the control of , e.g. , nems systems , as well - known @xcite .",
    "consequently , this subject is worthwhile to pay attention to , not only from the viewpoint of challenge in the quantum statistical physics but also from the viewpoint of quantum engineering .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider a linear chain of quantum harmonic oscillators coupled at an arbitrary strength to two separate baths at different temperatures ( `` quantum brownian harmonic chain '' ) , in which each individual chain element is intra - coupled at another arbitrary strength to its nearest neighbors .",
    "we intend to provide an exact closed expression for the steady - state heat current through the harmonic chain as our central result [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : heat - current0811])-([eq : heat - current08120 ] ) ] .",
    "the treatment of this physical quantity with rigor is mathematically manageable due to the linear structure of our system .",
    "we approach this open problem by applying the quantum langevin equation formalism to the caldeira - leggett type hamiltonian . by doing this",
    ", we can go beyond the aforementioned weak - coupling approach .",
    "our result may be straightforwardly generalized into a model of heat transport through a three - dimensional harmonic chain beyond the weak - coupling regime in case that heat diffusion perpendicular to the direction of the heat flux is neglected .",
    "the general layout of this paper is the following . in sect .",
