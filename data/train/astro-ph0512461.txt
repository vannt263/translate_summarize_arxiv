    "black holes ( bhs ) are a basic component of galaxies , and the existence of a tight correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion of bulges ( @xmath4 ) and the bh mass ( the @xmath3  relation ; gebhardt et al .  2000a ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) suggests that the growth of the bh plays a fundamental role in the growth of the bulge , although exactly how remains unclear ( e.g. ,  silk & rees 1998 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; di  matteo et al .",
    "the @xmath3  relation for inactive galaxies , in so far as it represents the final state of the bh - bulge system , represents a boundary condition for various evolutionary scenarios , and some clues are embedded in the scatter and possible skewness in the local @xmath3  relation ( robertson et al .",
    "unfortunately , the number of available points in the relation for inactive galaxies is limited , and statistics are poor . currently , our only recourse is to rely on bh masses from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "to the extent that the bhs in agns continue to gain mass , the relation of bh masses in agns to their host bulges may carry additional information about the establishment of the relation for inactive sources .",
    "since the majority of bh mass was assembled at high redshift ( e.g. ,  yu & tremaine 2002 ) , we might expect to find the strongest evidence for evolution in the @xmath3  relation at large cosmological distances ( shields et al.2003 ; treu et al .  2004 ; walter et al .  2004 ;",
    "peng et al .  2005 ) . while undoubtedly this is a vital direction to pursue , there are a number of compelling reasons to study the local agn @xmath3  relation as well .",
    "for one thing , while various methods are available to characterize the bulge potential , virial mass estimation ( e.g. ,  ho 1999 ; wandel et al .",
    "1999 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) , where the dense broad - line region ( blr ) gas is assumed to be on keplerian orbits around the central bh , is currently the most widely utilized tracer of bh mass . in the absence of a detailed model of the blr",
    ", the zeropoint for the virial bh mass scale is set through a direct comparison with stellar velocity dispersions for a small sample of local agns ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000b ; ferrarese et al.2001 ; nelson et al .  2004",
    "; onken et al .",
    "the virial bh masses considered in these studies are remarkably consistent with the @xmath3  relation of inactive galaxies , suggesting virial masses are reliable .",
    "but we must be cautious .",
    "for instance , there are compelling reasons to believe the blr is actually a disk - wind ( e.g. ,  murray & chiang 1997 ; proga et al .",
    "2000 ; proga & kallman 2004 ) whose kinematics depend on both the mass and the accretion rate onto the bh . in this scenario ,",
    "the virial mass calibration would depend systematically on bh mass and luminosity .",
    "we require objects spanning a wide range of agn properties to properly calibrate the primary rung in our agn bh `` mass ladder . '' at the same time , we may hope to learn about evolution of the @xmath3  relation by looking at the full distribution of local bhs ( robertson et al .",
    "2005 ) , and agns in particular ( e.g. ,  yu & lu 2004 ) , in the @xmath3  plane .",
    "our goal is to directly compare @xmath5  with @xmath4  for a large sample of agns . as outlined in greene & ho (",
    "2005c ) , we selected spectroscopically identified agns from the third data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss dr3 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2005 ) with @xmath6 and signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios per pixel @xmath7 in the region surrounding the @xmath88498 , 8542 , 8662 triplet ( cat ) .",
    "here we consider the 32 objects from greene & ho ( 2005c ) with resolved @xmath4  measurements and robust h@xmath9line widths . to increase the sample , we have relaxed the @xmath10 requirement and included an additional 24 galaxies to satisfy the criteria established by greene & ho for use of the `` fe region '' ( 52505820  ) : s / n @xmath11 ( @xmath12 s / n @xmath13 ) , estimated eddington ratios [ @xmath14 , where @xmath15  ( @xmath5/@xmath2 ) ergs s@xmath0 ] @xmath17 , and agn contamination @xmath18 .",
    "in addition to the 56 objects from the sdss , we include 15 intermediate - mass bhs ( imbhs ; @xmath5  @xmath19 @xmath20  @xmath2 ) from greene & ho ( 2004 ) with @xmath4  measurements from barth et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , resulting in a total of 71 objects ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersions are measured using a + 3 mm direct pixel - fitting algorithm described in detail in greene & ho ( 2005c ) .",
    "the uncertainties are derived from simulations in which the agn contamination and s / n ratio are varied for a grid of model galaxy spectra .",
    "virial masses are based on reverberation mapping ( blandford & mckee 1982 ) , which uses the measured lag between variability in the photoionizing continuum and emission lines to estimate blr radii .",
    "currently there are 35 reverberation - mapped agns in the literature ( peterson et al .",
    "these , in turn , are used to calibrate the radius - luminosity relation , @xmath21@xmath22 @xmath23@xmath24 ( greene & ho 2005b ; see also kaspi et al .",
    "2005 ) , from which it is possible to infer a radius from the agn luminosity . combining the radius with an estimate of the velocity dispersion of the blr",
    "yields a virial mass estimate for the bh , @xmath5=@xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a factor that accounts for the geometry of the blr .",
    "we assume @xmath27 for a spherical blr ( netzer 1990 ) .",
    "because our sample is selected to have strong stellar continua , virial bh mass estimation requires special care . under these circumstances",
    "the most robust virial mass estimator is that based on the width and luminosity of the broad h@xmath9  emission line , as advocated by greene & ho ( 2005b ) .",
    "the emission - line fitting is described in greene & ho ( 2004 , 2005b ) .",
    "briefly , the stellar continuum is modeled and removed using a principal component analysis designed for the sdss data by lei hao ( hao et al .",
    "we then construct a multi - component gaussian model of the [ ]  @xmath86716 , 6731 doublet , which is shifted and scaled to fit the narrow h@xmath9 + [ ]  @xmath286548 , 6583 complex .",
    "the remaining ( broad ) h@xmath9  flux is fit with as many gaussian components as needed to provide a statistically acceptable fit , although we attach no physical significance to the individual components . as described in greene & ho ( 2005b ) , we measure both @xmath29  and the true second moment ( @xmath30 ) from the multi - component gaussian fits .",
    "the uncertainties in the luminosities and line widths are derived using simulations , although we set a minimum uncertainty of @xmath31 on the line width .",

    "we begin by fixing the slope @xmath32 to the best - fit value of 4.02 from tremaine et al . and investigate potential offsets in zeropoint .",
    "we find , for our sample alone , a best - fit @xmath47 , which corresponds to an offset of @xmath48 from the value of @xmath49 of tremaine et al .",

    "2000b ; nelson et al.2004 ; onken et al .  2004",
    "; see summary in table 2 ) .",
    "the offset increases to @xmath50 when the literature values are included ( using either the reverberation - mapped or virial mass for ngc 4395 ) .",
    "note that we are using formal uncertainties in @xmath5 , while the true uncertainties are probably dominated by our ignorance of the blr geometry and the corresponding uncertainty in how to extract the velocity dispersion of the virialized blr from the observed line profile .",
    "following tremaine et al .  and gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , we estimate the intrinsic scatter as the value @xmath51 that , when added to @xmath52 , results in a minimum @xmath53  of 1 . for both our sample alone and including the literature sample , we find an intrinsic scatter , rather than @xmath29  is used to estimate @xmath5 , partly because of the difficulty of measuring the low - contrast line wings .",
    "we therefore consider only masses derived using @xmath29  in the following .",
    "we estimate that disk rotation contributes at most a small error to @xmath4  since we find no correlation between galaxy inclination angle and deviation from @xmath3  ( @xmath54 probability of no correlation with kendall s @xmath55 ) , and typically only the inner @xmath56 of the galaxy light enters the fiber .",
    "see further arguments in greene & ho ( 2005a ) .",
    "] of @xmath51=0.4 ( dotted lines in fig .",
    "1 ) . this is to be compared with the estimated scatter of 0.25 - 0.3 dex for the inactive sample ( tremaine et al .",
    "while there is probably intrinsic scatter in the underlying @xmath3  relation , we conservatively adopt 0.4 dex as the systematic uncertainty in the single - epoch @xmath5  measurements , so that we bracket the full range in possible uncertainty . if we repeat the fitting above increasing the uncertainties in the single - epoch bh masses by 0.4 dex in quadrature , the results for our sample alone are virtually unchanged , while we find @xmath57 for the full sample , which corresponds to an offset of @xmath58 .",
    "this offset is similar to that advocated by onken et al . , but it is statistically much more robust , being based on a final sample that is nearly 6 times larger .    when we fit both the zeropoint and slope , we obtain @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) if we include ( exclude ) literature values , corresponding to slopes flatter than the value of @xmath63 for inactive sources by @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) . including the 0.4 dex scatter to the single - epoch measurements yields an even flatter slope , with @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) .",
    "it appears that much of the flattening is driven by objects with bh masses @xmath70  @xmath2 , which rely on an extrapolation of the radius - luminosity relation and thus may be suspect .",
    "[ as pointed out by barth et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , these objects also may be biased by selection toward large @xmath5  at a given @xmath4 . ] when we remove the barth et al .",
    "objects , as well as pox 52 and ngc 4395 , but include all other data , we find @xmath71 with the formal errors , or @xmath72 with the additional 0.4 dex uncertainty added .",
    "the fact that the slope is still shallower when the ( more realistic ) uncertainties are included gives us some confidence that the flattening is real .",
    "we have established , with statistical confidence for the first time , that the @xmath3  relation of local agns , while generally similar to that of inactive galaxies , shows some significant differences .",
    "we find evidence for a lower zeropoint , shallower slope , and ( probably ) larger scatter .",
    "there are many competing effects , relating both to blr physics and galaxy evolution ,    + 3 mm that may contribute to the observed differences .",
    "if we posit that agns obey the relation of inactive galaxies exactly , then the scatter and zeropoint offset may be attributed to variations in the geometry of the blr .",
    "this is the assumption made by onken et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who derive a statistical offset in the factor @xmath26 that scales all bh masses upwards relative to the case of a spherical blr . if , however , as suggested by disk - wind models ( e.g. ,  proga & kallman 2004 ) , the geometry of the blr depends on physical properties of the agn such as the bh mass and the eddington ratio , then virial mass estimates will not scatter randomly about one fixed value of @xmath26 .",
    "rather , @xmath26 will change systematically with the state of the system , and its average value for any given sample will depend on the range of parameter space spanned by the objects used to derive it .",
    "it is important to recognize that all work so far  including ours  has considered a rather limited range in @xmath5  and @xmath14 , and so may lead to a biased value of @xmath26 .",
    "apart from the greene & ho ( 2004 ) objects studied by barth et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the practical challenge of detecting stellar absorption features to measure @xmath4  inevitably biases the final sample toward relatively low eddington ratios and bh masses .",
    "excluding the barth et al .",
    "objects , the sample summarized in figure 1 has a median @xmath14  = @xmath73 and @xmath20  @xmath5  @xmath74  @xmath2 . while we expect that secondary parameters ( e.g. , @xmath14 ) may ultimately help to account for the overall scatter in the agn @xmath3  relation , we refrain from discussing this issue here because we believe that a proper analysis would require a larger and more complete sample than is currently available .",
    "apart from systematic uncertainties in virial masses , evolution of the @xmath3  relation with cosmic time ( e.g. ,  shields et al .  2003 ; treu et al .  2004 ; walter et al .  2004 ; peng et al .",
    "2005 ) also imprints scatter and skewness into the local relation as a function of @xmath5(robertson et al .",
    "however , it is unclear at this stage how much scatter can be attributed to the fact that bhs in agns , in so far as they are radiating and thus accreting , are still gaining mass .",
    "any differential growth between bhs and bulges will introduce additional scatter to the agn @xmath3  relation if agn accretion and star formation are not precisely synchronized ( ho 2005 ; kim et al .",
    "if we ascribe all the observed scatter to differential growth ( taking the observed scatter of @xmath75 dex in the relation for inactive objects from tremaine et al . ) , there can be no more than @xmath760.3 dex scatter ( factor of 2 ) introduced by relative bh - bulge growth .",
    "this level of growth has only modest fuel requirements that are easy to sustain in nearby galaxies ; a @xmath20 @xmath2  bh requires only @xmath77  @xmath2  yr@xmath0 to double its mass in a saltpeter time ( @xmath78 yr ) .    finally , taking our entire data set at face value , we do find evidence for a shallower slope than the inactive @xmath3  relation . whether this is the result of flattening at low mass or a different slope in agns is difficult to determine at the present time , in the absence of more agns with @xmath5  @xmath79  @xmath2 . in this",
    "regard , wyithe ( 2005 ) argues that the slope for the inactive sample steepens considerably when the four smallest @xmath4  values are removed , independently suggesting flattening at low mass .",
    "flattening at low mass may be a result of the changing efficiency in agn feedback in low - mass halos .",
    "for instance , the formalism of vittorini et al .",
    "( 2005 ) finds that a combination of decreased optical depth ( proportional to galaxy radius ) and cooling times shorter than a dynamical time ( small , dense halos ) allows these bhs to grow to larger relative masses without feedback limitations .",
    "alternatively , different growth modes between spheroidal and disk - dominated systems may result in a different final position on the @xmath3  plane . on the other hand",
    ", we can not preclude the possibility that a change in slope in the blr radius - luminosity relation at low luminosity is responsible for the change in slope in the @xmath3  relation .",
    "however , we note that a radius - luminosity slope closer to the theoretically preferred value of 0.5 ( e.g. ,  kaspi et al .  2000 ) would only increase the observed discrepancy in slope .",
    "reverberation mapping of low - mass bhs would be required to address this issue .    in summary ,",
    "although we have increased the population of agns with @xmath4   measurements by a factor of nearly 6 , we do not yet have a large enough sample , or adequate coverage of parameter space , to uniquely identify the cause or causes responsible for the observed differences between the @xmath3  relation of local active and inactive galaxies .",
    "future effort should focus on ( 1 ) further enlarging the sample of agns with robust @xmath4  measurements , ( 2 ) pushing the samples to the extremes of the mass distribution , particular above @xmath74  @xmath2 , ( 3 ) extending the luminosity coverage to include objects with a wider range in eddington ratios , and ( 4 ) better characterizing the blr radius - luminosity relation over a broader range of agn properties than is currently available .",
    "we thank l. hao for providing her pca code , d.  proga for useful discussion , and the sdss collaboration for providing the extraordinary database and processing tools that made this work possible .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for a prompt and positive review ."
