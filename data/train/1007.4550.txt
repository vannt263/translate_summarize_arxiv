    "in this letter we compare wide - field images of atomic hydrogen ( ) and far ultraviolet ( fuv ) emission , a tracer of recent star formation ( sf ) , in the far outer disk of the nearby spiral galaxy m83 .",
    "star formation in the outer disks of galaxies has been the subject of numerous studies , including direct optical observations of massive sf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and studies of the star - forming interstellar medium ( ism ) using co emission @xcite or dust @xcite . with its large field - of - view and excellent sensitivity , the _ galaxy evolution explorer _",
    "( galex ) revolutionized this field , revealing widespread , extended sf in the far outer reaches ( i.e. , far beyond the optical disks ) of many galaxies @xcite . at the same time",
    "it has long been known that many galaxies host extended  distributions  including m83 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    mainly due to the lack of matched wide - field and sensitive uv and 21 cm observations , it is still largely unclear how these two extended components  star formation traced by fuv emission and atomic hydrogen ",
    "relate to one another .",
    "although the integrated star formation rates ( sfrs ) in extended uv ( xuv ) disks represent only a small fraction of the total sfr , the -sfr connection at large radii bears on a number of aspects of galaxy structure and evolution , such as the shapes and edges of stellar disks @xcite or chemical enrichment gradients across galaxies @xcite . the consumption of outer disk  by sf affects the availability of this gas for fueling sf in inner galaxy disks , a necessary process for galaxies to sustain sf over cosmological times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , comparing uv and  in the extreme ( low - density , often low - metallicity ) environment of outer galaxy disks can illuminate the limiting conditions for cloud and star formation (  star formation threshold \" ) .    in this letter",
    "we combine sensitive , large field - of - view  data from things ( the  nearby galaxy survey , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with extremely deep fuv data from galex to study the relationship between  ( the dominant component of the ism at large radii ) and fuv emission in the nearby spiral galaxy m83 .",
    "previous , shallower galex observations showed that m83 hosts one of the most prominent examples of a xuv disk @xcite .",
    "this unique data set allows us to trace the distribution of  and fuv emission across a @xmath5 field - of - view , corresponding to almost 4 optical radii r@xmath6 ( defined as the 25th b - band mag arcsec@xmath7 isophote ) .",
    "we use these data to measure the location (  [ sec : location ] ) and amount (  [ sec : amount ] ) of fuv emission relative to the . in section  [ dist - hi ] we investigate the distribution of  surface densities in different radial regimes across m83 .",
    "we use  data from the nrao vla obtained as part of things to construct a map of  21 cm emission across a @xmath5 field - of - view ( figure [ fig1 ] , lower left panel ) .",
    "this map has been corrected for primary beam attenuation ( the vla primary beam fwhm is @xmath8 ) . to maximize sensitivity for extended emission",
    ", we apply the  natural \" weighting scheme , which yields a sensitivity ( 1@xmath9 rms ) of @xmath10mjy / beam ( or @xmath11 ) and a resolution of @xmath12 . m83 is known to contain a significant amount of its total  content in the form of diffuse , low column density  in its outer disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which our interferometric observations will not pick up by design .",
    "because we are focussing on  emission associated with ( localized ) star formation , the potentially missing flux on very large ( @xmath13 ) scales is not a concern in the current study .",
    "when quoting  surface densities we include a factor of 1.36 to account for helium and heavier elements .",
    "the galex fuv data are part of our gi program gi3 - 050 .",
    "due to two bright stars near m83 , the galex observations were carried out in petal pattern mode allowing for the field - of - view to be centered on the galaxy .",
    "the galex field - of - view is slightly larger than the area covered by the  map .",
    "we thus restrict our analysis to the @xmath5 field covered by both maps .",
    "m83 was observed for 9 orbits ( @xmath14ks ) yielding a fuv map about three times as sensitive as the galex nearby galaxy survey m83 map @xcite .",
    "we use a gaussian kernel to degrade the resolution of the fuv map to @xmath15 to match that of the  map . in this map ,",
    "the ( median based ) @xmath16 rms scatter of the noise is about @xmath17mjy arcsec@xmath7 .",
    "we adopt inclination ( @xmath18 ) and position angle ( @xmath19 ) from @xcite , distance ( @xmath20 ) from @xcite and the optical radius ( @xmath21 ) from leda @xcite . for details of data processing ,",
    "the conversion of measured intensities to physical units ( e.g. , fuv intensities into estimated sfr surface densities ) , assessment of uncertainties , etc .",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that  ( lower left panel ) and uv emission ( top panels ) are detected far into the outer disk of m83 ( the edge of the maps corresponds to @xmath22 ) .",
    "it also shows a remarkable spatial coincidence of major features found in the maps .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows this even more clearly : plotted are ( smoothed )  contours of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) on top of the galex fuv map .",
    "almost every  feature has a corresponding feature in the fuv map .",
    "even very remote structures , such as the tip of the extended , western  arm show fuv emission and thus signs of recent star formation activity .",
    "this close correspondence implies that the extended  disk represents the reservoir from which the young stars emitting the fuv emission are forming ( presumably with an intermediate stage of bound molecular gas )",
    ". it also implies , quite surprisingly , that massive star formation proceeds  if at a low level  almost everywhere  is observed .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] quantifies the coincidence of  and fuv .",
    "the @xmath25-axis gives the fraction of the total fuv ( gray ) or  ( black ) flux found in regions ( i.e. , along lines - of - sight ) with  surface densities lower than the value on the @xmath26-axis .",
    "for example , for an @xmath26-axis  surface density of 2  m@xmath27  pc@xmath7 , we identify all area ( i.e. , lines - of - sight ) in the maps with @xmath28  m@xmath27  pc@xmath7 .",
    "we then add up the  ( fuv ) emission from this area and divide this  ( fuv ) flux by the  ( fuv ) flux of the entire map to get the fraction of flux found below the  surface density of 2  m@xmath27  pc@xmath7 .",
    "for comparison , we also plot ( dotted line ) the fraction of area as a function of  surface density ( e.g. , in the above example the fraction of the entire m83  map with @xmath29  m@xmath27  pc@xmath7 ) .    the key point in figure [ fig3 ] is that the fuv curve ( gray ) tracks the  curve ( black ) much more closely than it follows the area curve ( dotted ) .",
    "the area curve is the expected distribution for fuv emission if it were randomly distributed across the map .",
    "the fact that the  and fuv curves are quite similar thus shows that rather than being randomly distributed , the distribution of fuv flux seems to follow that of the .",
    "also , while most of the area in our map is covered by low column ( or no ) , the fuv comes mostly from lines - of - sight with relatively high @xmath30 .",
    "for example , @xmath31 of the area has  surface densities @xmath32 , while only @xmath33 of the fuv flux comes from this area .",
    "this behavior is expected if fuv is spatially correlated with  emission and implies that a substantial amount of  ( high surface densities ) seems to be a necessary prerequisite to star formation .",
    "having seen that fuv and  emission are remarkably coincident , we now ask how the _ amount _ of fuv emission compares to the mass of  along a line - of - sight .",
    "the  is concentrated into features ( the arms and filaments in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig5 ] ) with a relatively low filling fraction , and we have just seen that fuv emission is largely coincident with these features .",
    "our approach here is to look at the mean ratio of -to - fuv _ along these features _ as a function of radius , asking  where there is , what is its average surface density and what is the associated average fuv intensity ? \" . for this",
    ", we consider only emission from areas that have  surface densities ( in a smoothed 30@xmath34 resolution version of the  map ) @xmath35 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the average  and fuv intensities along these features .",
    "differences are immediately apparent : the fuv profile ( gray ) decreases over many orders - of - magnitude from the inner parts into the outer disk before it levels off at about @xmath36 ( note that the fuv emission is not corrected for internal extinction , which is significant at small radii ) .",
    "the fuv emission at large radii is still detected with good sensitivity ; the profile is always well above the gray dotted line , which shows the typical 5@xmath9 sensitivity .",
    "this supports the qualitative conclusion from figure [ fig5 ] that the extended  structures in m83 seem to coincide with fuv emission , indicating recent sf activity out to largest radii .",
    "in contrast to the fuv profile , the  surface density ( black ) shows only a moderate change with radius .",
    "the typical ( azimuthally averaged )  surface density is @xmath37 .",
    "assuming fuv emission to arise mostly from young massive stars forming at a steady rate , we can convert the measured fuv intensities into star formation rate surface densities , @xmath38 ( using the same procedure as * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . then the ratio of the two profiles @xmath39 ( which is proportional to @xmath40 ) is the  depletion time , the time it takes ( present day ) sf to deplete the current supply of .",
    "this quantity is shown as a function of radius in the right panel of figure [ fig4 ] ( note that inside @xmath41 we do not expect @xmath42 to trace the gas depletion time , as both  and extinction become important ) .",
    "the  depletion time rises from the optical disk @xmath0 out to @xmath43 and then remains relatively constant across the far outer disk of m83 at about 100gyr , i.e. , many hubble times .",
    "this very long timescale has several implications .",
    "first , it is much longer than the @xmath44gyr depletion time of the _ molecular _ gas observed in the inner disks of galaxies @xcite . assuming bound , molecular clouds form stars with roughly the same efficiency in the inner and outer disk",
    ", this extremely long  depletion time suggests that the process of building these molecular clouds is the bottleneck for forming stars at large radii .",
    "combined with the rather low  columns that dominate at large radii , the regulating and / or limiting factor for star formation in these environments may well be that of driving the  to high enough densities to trigger the atomic - to - molecular phase transition and subsequent star formation .",
    "the long  depletion time also implies that the extended  reservoir in the outer disk is long - lived , or at least that _ in situ _ star formation is unlikely to consume the gas .",
    "this means that this gas is in principle available as fuel for star formation in the inner disk , if it can be efficiently transported into the inner part of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "single dish observations sensitive to the entire  distribution ( compare  [ data ] ) suggest that m83 hosts a very large reservoir of  beyond the optical disk  as much as 80% of the total  mass ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the total mass of this  reservoir may well exceed @xmath45 , which would in principle be enough to sustain present - day sf in the inner disk of m83 for 23 times longer than is possible from the  alone @xcite .",
    "the moderate sf activity at large radii should also chemically enrich the  envelope .",
    "if the disk remained in its present configuration for @xmath46  gyr , then the integrated outer - disk sfr ( @xmath47 beyond @xmath0 ) and a stellar yield of @xmath48 @xcite imply a mass of heavy elements equal to about @xmath49 of the total outer disk  mass ( as determined from our map ) .",
    "this is only a coarse estimate , but it shows that even the low observed outer disk sfr may enrich the outer disk gas to a moderate metallicity .",
    "this fits to observations of emission from hot dust @xcite and fairly decent metallicities @xcite in the xuv disk of m83 .",
    "we have seen that low level star formation is pervasive in the  arms and filaments in the outer disk of m83 .",
    "we have also seen that the absolute level of this star formation is very low compared to that found in galaxy disks .",
    "what drives this drop in the fraction of  that eventually ends up in stars ?",
    "a number of authors have suggested that a drop in  column or volume density leads to some critical prerequisite for cloud formation not being met ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude by briefly examining how  surface densities actually change between inner and outer disk .",
    "the left panel in figure [ fig2 ] shows the ( normalized ) distribution of @xmath30 for lines - of - sight in different radial regimes ( see caption for details ) .",
    "the right panel shows the same data , but now each line - of - sight is weighted by mass , so that the left panel gives the distribution of surface densities and the right panel shows at what column most of the mass is found .    in the left panel ,",
    "the histograms from different regimes are not particulary distinct though one can see some enhancement in the  columns found inside @xmath3 ( visible also as the  bump \" in the radial profile in the left panel of figure [ fig4 ] between @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "these differences are much easier to see in the mass - weighted histograms on the right . while in the optical disk  surface densities between @xmath52 contribute roughly equally to the integrated  mass in this regime , it is clearly the lowest  columns that contribute most to the mass in the outer disk ( i.e. , beyond @xmath0 ) .",
    "in fact , there appears to be a radial trend in the sense that as one moves inwards from the far outer disk , an increasing fraction of the  mass comes from lines - of - sight with relatively high  surface density .",
    "we saw that in the outer disk of m83 , high  surface densities , likely a prerequisite for molecular gas and subsequent star formation , contribute a decreasing fraction to the overall  mass as one moves to large radii .",
    "the extended arms seen in figure [ fig1 ] thus seem to represent merely the  tip of the iceberg \" of the extended  distribution in m83 . these arms , however , appear to be the regions where pervasive star formation can proceed even at extreme galactocentric radii .",
