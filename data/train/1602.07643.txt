    "fast radio bursts ( frbs ) , discovered by @xcite and reported by a range of teams since @xcite have been predicted to be fantastic cosmological and astrophysical probes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "they have additionally been shown by @xcite to be an excellent tool for constraining fundamental physics , namely einstein s equivalence principle ( eep ) , if frbs originate at cosmological distances . @xcite use limits on the gravitational time delay between photons of different radio frequencies generated by a frb to infer upper limits on @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the post - newtonian parameter describing how much space curvature is produced by a unit test mass @xcite at the particular frequency of photon @xmath7 ; @xmath8 for general relativity .",
    "effectively , this treatment looks for whether or not photons of different energies `` fall '' at the same rate in a gravitational potential , in contrast to absolute limits on @xmath9 that must be calibrated more carefully @xcite , with the best limits around @xmath10 or @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "@xcite infer their limits from their equations 3 and 4 :    @xmath12    @xmath13^{-1 } , \\ ] ]    where : @xmath14  is the observed time delay between photons of different frequencies ; @xmath15  is the time delay between photons of different frequencies due only to plasma dispersion , important at radio frequencies ; @xmath16 is as described above ; @xmath17 is the speed of light ; @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the positions of the emitter and the observer , respectively ; @xmath20 is the gravitational potential along the line of sight from emitter to observer ; @xmath21 is the gravitational constant ; @xmath22 is the mass of the milky way ; @xmath23 is the distance between emitter and observer ; and @xmath24 is the impact parameter of the emitted signal relative to the milky way center . note that more accurate potential models can be used ( e.g. , @xcite ) but they change the results by at most 10% .",
    "@xcite approximate the time delay between photons of two different frequencies due to the gravitational potential along the line of sight as @xmath25 .",
    "the fundamental observable for frbs is @xmath14 .",
    "for all detected frbs the full value of @xmath14  has been equated with @xmath15  to infer a dispersion measure ( dm ) and therefore estimate a distance for each frb , assuming knowledge of the ionized intergalactic medium and the frb s local environment .",
    "this indirect method of estimating distances has been necessary as the single dish radio telescopes used to detect frbs have lacked the angular resolution to identify any progenitor or host galaxy .",
    "@xcite use such a line of reasoning ( that @xmath26 ) to estimate the redshift , and therefore distance , to frb 110220 @xcite , but then require that the majority of @xmath14is due to gravitational delay ( @xmath27 ) in order to produce a strict upper limit of @xmath28 between the frequencies of 1.2ghz and 1.5ghz .",
    "@xcite undertake a sensitivity analysis , given the uncertainties in the assumptions ( distance to frb and relative contributions of dispersion delay and gravitational delay to @xmath14 ) , to show that their limits are not particularly sensitive to the assumptions .",
    "@xcite also produced limits for two proposed gamma - ray burst ( grb)/frb associations .",
    "grb 101011a and grb 100704a were proposed to be associated with frb - like radio transients by @xcite .",
    "neither grb has a redshift measurement , however , with distances estimated through the empirical @xcite relation .",
    "moreover , further searches for frb - like radio emission associated with grbs , and a joint statistical analysis of a range of such experiments by @xcite , show that the frb - like signals reported by @xcite are unlikely to be astrophysical .",
    "thus , we do not consider these further as appropriate for deriving eep limits .",
    "conversely , the grb - only constraints from @xcite are still valid .    clearly , obtaining accurate distances to frbs is one key advance required to utilise frbs in the type of analysis proposed by @xcite .",
    "very recently the first accurate localisation of an frb has led to the likely identification of an frb host galaxy and the measurement of an frb redshift @xcite",
    ". however , see @xcite for an alternate interpretation of the results presented in @xcite .",
    "frb 150418 was detected at the parkes radio telescope on 2015 april 18 at 04:29:07.056ut at a frequency of 1382mhz , reported by @xcite .",
    "rapid multi - wavelength follow - up revealed a fading radio source at j2000 coordinates ra=@xmath29 , dec@xmath30 which @xcite argue is an afterglow associated with the frb . at the position of the afterglow , imaging on the subaru and palomar 200-inch telescope and spectroscopy with subaru and keck",
    "reveal a @xmath31 galaxy , giving a luminosity distance of approximately @xmath32 gpc ( for an assumed cosmology of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ; @xcite ) .    from the celestial coordinates of frb 150418 , and",
    "taking the distance to the centre of the milky way from earth to be 8 kpc , the impact parameter is @xmath36kpc .",
    "the measured time delay , @xmath37 , for frb 150418 was approximately 0.8s , between frequencies of approximately 1.2 and 1.5ghz . using the same value for @xmath38 as used by @xcite and their assumption that @xmath27 , the limit on @xmath3 for frb 150418 is @xmath39 , for photons of frequency 1.2ghz and 1.5ghz .",
    "this limit is comparable to that inferred for frb 110220 by @xcite . however , after accounting for dispersion due to the host galaxy , the milky way , and the milky way halo , @xcite estimate that the remaining dispersion due to the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is @xmath40 , which gives @xmath41 from the frb 150418 data .",
    "this is compared to expectations from @xmath2cdm models and wmap observations , which predict @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "both estimates agree to within the errors , leading to the reasonable conclusion that @xmath14  is dominated by dispersion and that the assumption adopted by @xcite  @xmath43  is not needed for frb 150418 .",
    "it is , however , still difficult in the case of frb 150418 to determine what fraction of @xmath14  could be attributable to gravitational delays . within the errors , @xmath14  for frb 150418 is plausibly explained by dispersion in and around the milky way , in the host galaxy , and in the igm .",
    "however , the errors in the various dm components are of order 20% . for example , an error of 20% is quoted by @xcite on the largest non - igm component of @xmath44 , equating to @xmath455% of the total dm .",
    "also , a 100@xmath46error is quoted on the igm contribution to the dm , equating to @xmath4510% of the total dm .",
    "if errors in these quantities of 5%10% magnitude masked gravitational delays , the limit on @xmath3 above would be reduced by factors of 1020 , giving @xmath47 ( for a factor of 20 ) .",
    "this limit is more than an order of magnitude lower than that obtained by @xcite .",
    "we plot this limit along with other differential limits on @xmath16 in figure  [ fig : gamma ] .",
    "with confirmation by @xcite that frbs originate at cosmological distances , they are now serious contenders as cosmological probes and of great interest for their intrinsic astrophysics . in addition to the fundamental advance provided by @xcite , other recent results are starting to reveal information on their progenitors and environments @xcite . as suggested by @xcite ,",
    "future instruments such as the square kilometre array ( ska ) will be well - placed to open up new lines of investigation into astrophysics and cosmology using frbs @xcite .    in the specific use of frbs to place limits on einstein s equivalence principle ,",
    "the work of @xcite suggests great promise . with a distance now known for frb 150418 , improved limits",
    "are now possible for this single frb , likely approximately an order of magnitude better than inferred by @xcite .",
    "however , to achieve further improvements in eep limits using frbs with the same technique will be difficult .",
    "the sensitivity of the limits to distance are not strong , as shown by @xcite since , for cosmological frbs , @xmath23 will always be of order gpc and @xmath24 will always be of order kpc , entering as ln@xmath48 in the limit on @xmath3 .",
    "incremental improvements for frb  150418  may be possible through more realistic gravitational potentials for the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the local group , and the host galaxy ( once more mass estimates are available )",
    ".    however , substantial improvements are possible via other sources of gravitational potential .",
    "@xcite argue that the potential from large - scale structure can lower the eep limit by up to four orders of magnitude .",
    "this primarily comes from a statistical treatment of the fluctuations in gravitational potential estimated from the cosmic microwave background power spectrum ( assuming linear structure growth ) . in a similar vein , @xcite estimate that eep limits from frbs",
    "could also be lowered by orders of magnitude if frbs were identified behind galaxy clusters .",
    "if the actual line - of - sight potential distribution is known for a burst like frb  150418  via optical or galaxy redshift surveys ( like @xcite or @xcite ) , a robust limit could be determined for individual objects .",
    "this would be in addition to the type of improvement in @xmath3 discussed above .",
    "a significant part of the value of the known distance for frb 150418 is in the confirmation that dispersion dominates @xmath14 .",
    "the challenge in placing future limits on eep from frbs will be in understanding the various dispersion components that contribute to this dominance : the milky way ( and halo ) contribution ; the contribution from the frb host galaxy ; and the igm contribution .",
    "these contributions are all uncertain at the 10% level .",
    "these uncertainties would need to be reduced to the @xmath49 level to place confident limits on differential gravitational delays and thus attain @xmath50 .",
    "we can look to improve models of the milky way s ionized content .",
    "this will likely come from a combination of frbs that are nearby ( on the sky ) to well - studied pulsars coupled with knowledge of the pulsar distances @xcite .",
    "the ska may be required to gather such observations , in particular pulsar distances via parallax measurements @xcite .",
    "separately , searches for pulsars / frbs in local group galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could constrain the dispersion measure of the halo .",
    "if more than one source can be detected in one of these galaxies ( or even two cosmological frbs in the same host galaxy ) , they would have common igm and milky way ( including halo ) dm contributions but different host galaxy contributions .",
    "such a scenario would provide some knowledge of the magnitude ( and variability ) of the host galaxy dm contribution .",
    "recently , @xcite detected faraday rotation and scintillation for frb 110523 , providing evidence that this frb occurred in a dense magnetised plasma environment ( also see @xcite ) . assuming that frb 110523 originates in a host galaxy at cosmological distance",
    ", analyses such as performed by @xcite may , in the future , help provide some constraints on the dm contribution of the host galaxy .",
    "this may start to address the challenges noted above .",
    "the limits presented here are differential limits , @xmath3 .",
    "absent any particular form for eep violation as a function of photon energy , we consider how our limits compare with those of @xcite and others by looking at @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the ratio of high and low energies used in the limit .",
    "this is plotted in the right panel of figure  [ fig : gamma ] , and as can be seen the multi - decade spread in energies for grbs and blazars @xcite makes their limits in this metric better than frb  150418  by more than three orders of magnitude .",
    "however , this could potentially be rectified by future improvements in frb observing , as described above and below .",
    "obtaining independent limits across a broad range of the electromagnetic ( em ) spectrum will be useful if considering any model of eep violation that has a frequence dependence , as well as studies of the plasma dispersion and constraining progenitor models through spectral indices ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the recent direct detection of gravitational waves now opens up possibilities for similar tests using non - em channels .",
    "for example , @xcite calculate an upper limit to the difference in the speed of gravitational waves and gamma - rays from the possible coincidence of the gw150914 detection and a gamma - ray transient reported by @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite use the recent proposal that a gamma - ray outburst in pks b1424@xmath53418 was associated with a pev neutrino detection @xcite to place limits on eep .    while most frbs detected thus far have been between the frequencies of 1.2ghz and 1.5ghz at the parkes radio telescope , frb 110523 was detected between 700mhz and 900mhz with the green bank telescope @xcite .",
    "simultaneous detections at different telescopes may allow eep limits over substantially larger frequency ranges , improving @xmath51 significantly . in @xcite observations",
    "were done simultaneously with both parkes at 1.4ghz and the murchison widefield array ( mwa ) at 150mhz , although the latter was a non - detection .",
    "further frb searches are active at low frequencies ( @xmath45100 mhz ) with the mwa @xcite and lofar @xcite and at high frequencies ( 10s of ghz ) by the v - fastr project at the vlba @xcite .",
    "the larger frequency range also gives improved measurements of faraday rotation ( @xmath54 ) and scattering ( @xmath55 ) that can help separate local and igm contributions to time delay .",
    "extending this to searches at optical and high - energy ( x - ray , @xmath16-ray ) wavelengths could make this even more powerful , although there is not yet any evidence of simultaneous prompt emission from an frb outside the radio band .    further opportunities for testing the eep could come from the discovery of a multiply - imaged frb lensed by a galaxy ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , echoing the recent discovery of a multiply - imaged supernova by @xcite .",
    "this would require interferometric detection to achieve the needed spatial resolution , either with contemporary inteferometers @xcite or next - generation faclities like the ska .",
    "in addition to the standard cosmological tests @xcite , any deviations from the time delays expected purely from lensing could limit not just differential acceleration , @xmath56 , but the absolute acceleration @xmath16 .",
    "however , this relies on the precision of the lensing models , which in the case of sn  refsdal is limited because of the massive galaxy as well as a surrounding galaxy cluster .",
    "there could also be differences in dispersive delays through the cluster , but for typical intracluster medium densities of @xmath57 and lensing path delays of @xmath58d , the difference in dm would be only @xmath59 .",
    "searches for frbs toward massive galaxy clusters may be worthwhile even without the detection of of multiply - imaged bursts , as the cluster would give an additional dm contribution of @xmath60 ( for a cluster size of 1mpc ) which could be combined with measurements of the x - ray emission and the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite to strongly constrain the hot gas in the cluster and aid in sz cosmology .",
    "the polarisation observed for frbs may also be put to use in experiments utilizing a lensed frb @xcite .",
