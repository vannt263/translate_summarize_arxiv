    "the factor - of-2 depletion of o ( enrichment factor 0.46 ) has been attributed to the _ galileo _ probe s entry through a @xmath7 hotspot , a dry region of downwelling gas that may have had water removed through meteorological processes ( atreya et al .",
    "alternatively , we have suggested that o may similarly be sequestered in the he / ne droplets at depth ( young et al .",
    "a plausible hypothesis is that jupiter formed with solar abundances of he and ne and a factor - of-3 enrichment of o , then saw ne and o sequestered in he droplets by similar factors @xmath8 , resulting in a final enrichment of o of @xmath9 ; this is not too different from the observed enrichment factor 0.48 ( table 1 ) .",

    "a criticism of the scip model is that ices in present - day comets appear to be depleted in ar and @xmath57 , and not carrying solar compositions ( cochran et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ; weaver et al .  2002 ) .",
    "it is also the case that jupiter s formation environment at 5 au was considerably warmer than 35 k , closer to 55 k ; temperatures @xmath58 k would not be reached inside about 18 au from the sun ( chiang & goldreich 1997 ; lesniak & desch 2011 ) .",
    "jupiter would be expected to accrete considerably more ice from its local environment , depleted in ar and @xmath57 , than ice from beyond 18 au ; it would not be expected to exhibit the uniform enrichments in noble gases and other elements .",
    "a variation on this model involves trapping species in clathrate hydrates ( gautier et al .",
    "2001 ; hersant et al .",
    "trapping ar still requires temperatures @xmath55 k , however , and clathrates require more o ( as water ) to be accreted by jupiter than the model involving amorphous ice ( gautier & hersant 2005 ) .    a second model for jupiter s enrichments , proposed by guillot & hueso ( 2006 ; hereafter gh06 ) ,",
    "is that jupiter accreted gas that was solar in composition except for depletions in just the species h , he and ne .",
    "gh06 attributed the depletion of h , he and ne to loss of gas by external far ultraviolet ( fuv ) photoevaporation , from a region of the disk where all the other species have condensed into ice grains , so they are not swept up in the photoevaporative flow .",
    "this model has the attractive feature of predicting uniform enrichments ( relative to h ) of all species less volatile than ar , i.e. , everything except he and ne .    nevertheless , the gh06 model is flawed in several aspects .",

    "( for example , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the column densities of ar and h at some radius , and @xmath63 is the initial mass fraction of ar in the protosolar nebula . )",

    "this equation was derived by incorrectly assuming that trace species follow the same diffusion equation as the main gas .",
    "the correct equation to use , based on fick s law , is that of gail ( 2001 ) : @xmath68,\\ ] ] gh06 apparently overestimate the diffusion rate of trace species in the gas .",
    "another problem concerns the rate at which gas escapes from each annulus ( at radius @xmath69 ) due to photoevaporation . gh06",
    "use a formula based on the rates calculated by adams et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , but differing from theirs ( and , more clearly , equation 13 of anderson et al .  2013 ) by a factor of @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is essentially the radius of the sonic point of the photoevaporative flow .",
    "integration over @xmath72 of equation 9 of gh06 shows that it does not conform to that of adams et al .",
    "the gh06 model overestimates the mass loss from the top surface .",
    "it ignores the considerable outward radial transport that occurs in photoevaporated disks ( desch 2007 ) , which would bring solar - composition gas into the 5 au region .",
    "it also overestimates the ability of enriched gas to diffuse back into the inner disk .",
    "in addition , gh06 assume that noble gases and other species are trapped in small icy grains that would be lost from the gas if caught in the photoevaporative flow .",
    "they invoke settling of dust to the disk midplane to explain why grains are not lost from the top surface of the disk .",
    "meanwhile , at the outer edge of the disk , they assume icy grains _ are _ lost , so that mass loss at the outer edge does not enrich the nebular gas in ar or other species .",
    "these assumptions have the result that their model disks see a factor - of-3 enrichment only after they suffer loss of at least 98% of their mass ( figure 3 of gh06 ) .",
    "in fact , if the temperatures of the photoevaporated gas are 200 k or less , factor - of-3 enrichments are never seen .",
    "as we show below , many icy grains do remain suspended in the gas and yet are not lost in the photoevaporative flow , even from the disk outer edge .",
    "the gh06 model also discounts the inward migration of large volatile - bearing ice grains , which we argue is important . despite these shortcomings",
    ", we favor the basic idea of the gh06 model , that photoevaporation depletes the disk of h and jupiter accretes gas relatively enriched in other species .",
    "below we describe a disk model that retains this idea but also complies with modeled temperatures and radial transport in photoevaporated disks .",
    "a more fundamental problem of the gh06 model , the scip model , and indeed any model seeking to fractionate ar and @xmath1 , is the issue of how volatiles are trapped in ice at low temperatures .",
    "cold temperatures @xmath55 k are necessary but not sufficient conditions to trap ar and other noble gases in amorphous ice .",
    "the experiments of bar - nun et al .",
    "( 1985 , 1988 ) and others revealed that gases like ar could be trapped in amorphous ice _ as the ice was forming _ , via deposition of water vapor onto a very cold substrate .",
    "the ice that forms is amorphous precisely because of this vapor deposition , and the trapping is attributable to the speed at which vapor freezes .",
    "if amorphous ice were not _ forming _ , then ar vapor could condense only by adsorbing onto the ice or condensing as ar ice .",
    "but adsorption can only produce a monolayer , which we show (  4.1 ) is insufficient to trap much ar .",
    "trapping of ar and other species in amorphous ice , in solar proportions , requires the simultaneous conditions of plentiful water vapor , and temperatures @xmath58 k. this raises the question of how water vapor is generated in such a cold region . below",
    "we describe how fuv radiation  the same fuv radiation responsible for driving the photoevaporative outflow  will also photodesorb water molecules from ice , generating vapor even in the coldest parts of the disk .",
    "this same process ( though usually involving fuv radiation from the central star ) has been invoked to explain the observed abundances of very cold water vapor in protoplanetary disks such as tw hya ( hogerheijde et al .",
    "2011 ) and dg tau ( podio et al .",
    "2013 ) , and has been invoked by ciesla ( 2014 ) as a mechanism for forming amorphous ice in the outer solar nebula .",
    "these new insights have enabled us to develop a more complete model of how solar nebula gas can be enriched in elements ( relative to h ) over time .",
    "this model is based on that of gh06 but accounts for several additional physical effects .",
    "the model is illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "the disk is externally photoevaporated , losing mass at its outer edge at @xmath73 au ( adams et al .",
    "2004 ) . as a result ,",
    "the net flow of mass is outward through the outer solar system ( desch 2007 ) . as ices move through the outer solar nebula they are subject to irradiation by fuv radiation , the same radiation from nearby massive stars that is causing the disk s photoevaporation .",
    "the uv flux impinging the disk is a factor @xmath74 times the interstellar radiation field @xmath75 . at the disk midplane , where the bulk of ices are",
    ", the uv flux is attenuated by a factor @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the uv optical depth .",
    "uv photodesorbs water molecules from the ice grains , resulting in a non - zero steady - state partial pressure of water vapor . due to the cold temperatures",
    "@xmath78 k in the outer disk near 50 au , water vapor refreezes as amorphous ice when it encounters ice or dust grains .",
    "as it freezes , it also traps whatever other species are in the gas phase , including ar , kr , and xe ( but not @xmath1 , he or ne ) .",
    "although water vapor is likely to condense first onto the smallest ( micron - sized ) particles with the largest collective surface area , particles quickly grow to sizes large enough ( @xmath79 ) to dynamically decouple from the gas and avoid being carried out of the disk by the photoevaporative outflow .",
    "trapped gases , including ar , are retained by the disk , and only @xmath1 , he and ne are lost from the disk .",
    "from there it is likely that the ice particles will grow larger and experience gas drag , spiralling inward as a result .",
    "if these amorphous ice grains move into warmer regions of the disk and heat above @xmath80 k , they may undergo a spontaneous phase change and release all or some of the trapped volatiles ( bar - nun et al .",
    "1985 , 1988 ; kouchi & kuroda 1990 ) . whether or not the grains release these trapped volatiles as gas , they do not leave the disk , and the average composition of the disk is relatively enriched in trapped species , including ar .",
    "if jupiter accretes this material as it builds its atmosphere , its composition will appear similarly enriched in all trapped species . if the disk has lost @xmath81 of its mass over the time jupiter accretes its atmosphere , the uniform enrichment in all species except he and ne is explained .    ) , to be lost at an outer disk edge at @xmath82 au .",

    "jupiter accretes solar nebula gas that has lost a considerable amount of h and so appears enriched in all other species ( except he and ne ) . ]",
    "the goal of this paper is to present this newer , more complete model for the enrichments of elements in jupiter s atmosphere and to quantify key physical processes . in  2 we estimate the likely uv fluxes encountered by protoplanetary disks in high - mass star - forming regions , and describe the dynamics and evolution of a protoplanetary disk that is experiencing external photoevaporation . in ",

    "2009 ) . likewise , the uv flux needed to produce an edge at 50 au depends on mixing within the disk ; but for @xmath95 a flux @xmath94 , corresponding to a mass loss rate @xmath96 , is required ( adams et al .",

    "the loss of gas from the disk , especially its outer edge , changes the dynamics of gas at all locations in the disk . obviously gas will move outward flow through the disk to replenish what is lost at the outer edge .",

    "subsequent numerical work ( mitchell & stewart 2010 ; kalyaan et al .",

    "in fact , inward radial migration of icy grains and radial diffusion of gas ( inward and outward ) _ must _ occur ; but in an externally photoevaporated disk these inward motions , especially of gas trace species , are frustrated by the outward movement of gas .",
    "second , gh06 argued for fractionation of @xmath1 and ar only during photoevaporative removal of gas from the disk s top surface , but escape from the disk s outer edge is dominant",
    ". adams et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that the total mass lost from the disk s upper and lower surfaces was exceeded by mass loss from the outer edge by a factor @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the temperature to which gas is heated by fuv absorption .",

    "for example , if the disk is less massive or has evolved , so that the gas densities are lower , then @xmath129 molecules will diffuse even farther downward before freezing . on the other hand , in many disks dust is observed to have somewhat settled to the midplane . in their analysis of the spectral energy distributions of taurus protoplanetary disks , dalessio et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that in many ( but not necessarily all ) such disks , even small grains were depleted from the gas layers several scale heights above the midplane , by factors of 10 or more .",
    "whether the solar nebula protoplanetary disk experienced similar dust settling is unknown , but we can estimate its effects .",
    "since dust dominates the fuv opacity , the @xmath189 surface can be expected to follow the dust distribution . in disks with dust - depleted upper layers",
    ", this surface would be at lower @xmath186 , but the effect is not large ; from equation 12 , if 10 times more column density is required to become optically thick , then the @xmath189 surface will lie at @xmath201 at 30 au , and @xmath203 at 50 au ( instead of @xmath223 and @xmath224 ) .",

    "accordingly the timescales for an @xmath129 molecule to encounter a grain are reduced by the same factor , becoming comparable to , but not less than , the timescale for diffusion .",
    "thus , for moderate ( less than a factor of 10 ) degrees of dust depletion in the disk upper layers , our conclusions are unchanged .",
    "again , it is unknown whether dust was depleted in the upper layers of the outer disk , and in the scenario put forth here , in which the gas is turbulent with @xmath226 , micron - sized dust is not expected to settle to the midplane significantly ( e.g. , dubrulle et al .",

    "the column density of @xmath129 molecules is @xmath227 , where @xmath228 is the effective condensation time .",
    "based on the above discussion , we assume @xmath229 yr at 30 au , and @xmath230 yr at 50 au .",
    "we then find @xmath231 at 30 au , and @xmath232 at 50 au .",

    "the column density of ar atoms is @xmath234 @xmath235 at 30 au , or @xmath236 at 50 au .",
    "at 30 au there are slightly more ar atoms than @xmath129 molecules in the gas , possibly leading to less efficient trapping ; but that quickly changes to a 1:1 ratio as the gas moves past 35 au .",
    "increasingly as gas is radially transported out to 50 au , the @xmath237 ratio is comfortably larger than unity , allowing efficient trapping of ar .",
    "similar trends and conclusions would apply to co or @xmath57 .",
    "when water vapor condenses onto ice - mantled grains , it is likely to trap ar and other gases as it does , because @xmath154 k. the water vapor is also likely to condense onto the smallest particles , since these have the largest total surface area .",
    "for example , in the mrn distribution above , particles with @xmath238 make up only @xmath239 of the mass , but 43% of the surface area .",
    "small grains are also the most likely to be carried along with the gas as it enters the photoevaporative outflow . if ar is trapped in icy grains , but then those icy grains are dynamically coupled to the gas , then the situation is no different than if ar had remained in the gas phase .",
    "only if the ar can be sequestered into the largest grains , which dynamically decouple from the gas , can ar and @xmath1 be chemically fractionated .",
    "the size of particle that is retained by the disk can be estimated by examining the forces on it .",
    "adams et al .",
    "( 2004 ) considered the same problem and found that to be retained by the disk even as the photoevaporative flow is escaping at speed @xmath240 , the gravitational pull on the grain must exceed the drag force on the grain : @xmath241 where @xmath69 is the heliocentric distance .",

    "this condition is easily met at the top surface of the disk , where @xmath189 and @xmath247 . at the outer edge of the disk , @xmath248 ,",

    "as outlined above , small particles @xmath250 in radius have 43% of the surface area , and should therefore trap 43% of the ar .",
    "but at least half of the ar should remain in the disk , not participating in the photoevaporative flow .",
    "in fact , the situation is more favorable for retention than this , since icy grains will coagulate and shatter and regrow on relatively short timescales . in his calculations of these processes , weidenschilling ( 1997 ) found that even at 30 - 50 au , considerable evolution of the solids population takes place in less than a few @xmath251 yr .",
    "this is short compared to the radial transport timescale , which can be derived in two ways . in the surface density profile of desch ( 2007 ) , about @xmath252 of gas lies between 30 au and 50 au . assuming a mass flow @xmath96 , this mass is lost only on timescales @xmath127 yr . or",

    "these long radial flow timescales indicate that many small grains will have coagulated into larger grains by the time they reach the disk outer edge , and large grains shattered into small grains .",

    "this allows essentially all of the ar , or other species , to be trapped in the ice and to remain in the disk .    finally , as icy grains grow , they are likely to be subject to significant gas drag , since they remain in keplerian rotation while the pressure - supported gas revolves more slowly .",

    "gas carrying volatiles moves radially outward through the disk , eventually lost to a photoevaporative flow at the outer edge , but before it does , noble gases and other volatiles are sequestered in icy grains , thanks also to uv photodesorption of water vapor .",
    "a full calculation of the time- and space - varying enrichments in the outer solar nebula is beyond the scope of the present paper , which focuses on presenting the key physical processes and a first quantification of their effects .",
    "but we can estimate the evolution of the gas - phase ar enrichment in the outer disk using a simple box model .",
    "we consider the enrichment of ar in the outer solar nebula , extending from a few au to 50 au .",
    "the mass of gas in this region is @xmath274 , and the mass of ar in this region is @xmath275 .",
    "the enrichment is @xmath276 .",
    "we assume the enrichment is spatially uniform .",
    "the radial mixing timescale @xmath277 is not quite short enough to justify this ; for example , @xmath278 @xmath279 , which with @xmath95 and @xmath280 , yields @xmath281 myr at 30 au . but inward radial migration of volatile - bearing ices , with subsequent release of volatiles , may justify this simplifying assumption .",
    "we assume that gas is lost from the top surface of the disk at a rate @xmath282 , and from the outer edge at a rate @xmath283 .",
    "for now we neglect inflow of gas from the inner disk into this region .",
    "the mass of gas in this annulus is @xmath284 .",
    "the evolution of the enrichment is given by @xmath285 since ar is entirely in the gas phase at 30 au , and entirely condensed at 50 au , we assume on average it is 50% condensed in the box region , so that the time rate of change of the ar mass is @xmath286 solving for the enrichment as a function of time , we find @xmath287 this means that the remaining gas is enriched in ar by a factor of 3 ( @xmath288 ) when the mass in this annulus is 30% of the original mass .",
    "we could repeat the calculation , assuming that mass with a solar composition flows into the annulus across the 30 au inner edge , bringing ar with it . if that inflow of mass is a fraction @xmath289 of the total photoevaporative mass loss @xmath290 , then it is straightforward to show that @xmath291 in this scenario , the 30 to 50 au annulus outer contains more mass at a given enrichment . for example , if @xmath292 , the mass in the outer disk is 45% of its original value when the ar enrichment is @xmath288 .",
    "this simple calculation shows that factor - of-3 enrichments in ar in the outer solar nebula are possible while the disk still retains a good fraction of its mass , at least 30% .",
    "this is in contrast to the gh06 model , in which factor - of-3 enrichments in the solar nebula are seen only after the disk has lost @xmath293 of its mass ( figure 3 of gh06 ) .",
    "this is a problem for planet formation models because saturn , uranus and neptune must have taken considerably longer than jupiter to grow to the critical mass to capture their @xmath1/he atmospheres ( see desch 2007 ) .",
    "if jupiter accreted its atmosphere only after 98% of the disk mass is lost , it is not clear that any @xmath1/he gas would remain for the other gas giants to accrete .",
    "essentially , the disk models presented by gh06 evolve too quickly to be compatible with planet formation models .",
    "our disk model presented here is more consistent with planet formation models .",
    "these tend to show that jupiter accretes its atmosphere in a very rapid ( @xmath294 yr ) runaway process that occurs several myr after solar system formation ( lissauer et al .",
    "the composition of jupiter s atmosphere will basically be a snapshot of the conditions in the solar nebula at that time .",
    "to explain jupiter s noble gas abundances , the disk must have lost about 70% of its mass at the time of jupiter s runaway accretion .",
    "the time at which only 30% of the disk mass remains is a function of the external radiation field , parameterized through @xmath74 , which determines @xmath115 , the temperature of the photoevaporated gas .",
    "it is also a function of the turbulent viscosity in the disk , parameterized using the standard variable , @xmath93 .",
    "assuming an initial disk mass @xmath295 , @xmath296 , so that @xmath297 k , and assuming @xmath226 , anderson et al .",
    "( 2013 ) find that 70% of the disk mass is lost after 1.0 myr , and after only 0.2 myr if @xmath255 ; but these timescales are very sensitive to @xmath115 . [ notably , anderson et al .",
    "( 2013 ) do not calculate mass loss rates by self - consistently calculating @xmath115 , but rather by interpolating a mass loss rate provided by adams et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . ]",
    "mitchell & stewart ( 2010 ) find that 70% of the disk mass is lost after 1.2 myr in their canonical calculation with @xmath298 and photoevaporated gas temperature @xmath299 k. increasing @xmath93 to @xmath300 shortens the disk lifetime by 20% , but lower values of @xmath115 greatly prolong the disk lifetime ; if @xmath301 k , the disk lifetime is increased by a factor of 3 .",
    "existing calculations suggest that if @xmath302 and @xmath244 k , then 70% mass loss probably takes @xmath303 myr .",
    "calculations of disk evolution in which @xmath93 is attributable to the magnetorotational instability and calculated from first principles ( kalyaan et al . , in preparation ) suggest that while @xmath95 in the disk s outermost annuli ( and is therefore the value of @xmath93 relevant to mixing ) , @xmath226 is nevertheless the appropriate effective value for determining disk lifetimes , and that 70% mass loss takes 2 to 3 myr .",
    "in the models of lissauer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , runaway accretion takes place only after @xmath304 myr , but they assume low initial column densities of gas ( @xmath305 ) and solids ( @xmath306 ) at 5 au . in desch ( 2007 ) , anderson et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , and this work , more massive @xmath307 disks are considered ; the models of desch ( 2007 ) entail a gas column density @xmath308 and a solids column density @xmath309 at 5 au .",
    "based on these densities , we estimate runaway growth could occur more quickly ,    in @xmath310 myr .",
    "future work is required to reconcile disk evolution models with models of jupiter s accretion , but it seems likely that 70% mass loss from the disk , and the runaway accretion of jupiter s atmosphere , could easily both occur at a time @xmath311 myr after solar system formation .",
    "these calculations all assume that jupiter forms at 5 au , without significant migration , although of course jupiter may have migrated . within the context of the nice model ( tsiganis et al .",
    "2005 ) jupiter migrates only a few tenths of an au , but in other models ( walsh et al .",
    "2011 ; alexander & pascucci 2012 ) jupiter migrates several au .",
    "significantly , though , these migrations occur after jupiter has largely formed .",
    "if jupiter starts to migrate before it is completely formed , the effect will be to speed up the accretion of its atmosphere considerably ( alibert et al .",
    "2004 ) . in any event",
    ", the composition of jupiter s atmosphere is not sensitive to where jupiter forms : radial mixing ensures that throughout the outer solar nebula the gas composition is fairly uniform .    besides migration ,",
    "another effect that occurs after jupiter forms must be considered .",
    "when planets become large enough , they can open low - density gaps in the disk , or even large , optically thin cavities , making them  transition disks \" .",
    "the median accretion rates of gas onto the host stars are curtailed in transition disks , by a factor of @xmath312 compared to the median accretion rates in normal protoplanetary disks ( najita et al .  2007 ; espaillat et al .",
    "2012 ; kim et al .  2013",
    "; see also rosenfeld et al .",
    "this implies that if jupiter opens a gap , then one of the assumptions made above may be incorrect ; namely relatively h - rich gas may not be able to flow into the outer solar system from inside the orbit of jupiter .",
    "the presence of a gap is unlikely to change our conclusions , however .",
    "for one thing , the presence of a gap does not preclude the flow of gas across it .",
    "the above references indicate that mass flows are at least 10% of the mass flows in disks without gaps , and direct observations of gas in the gaps also indicates substantial movement of gas through them ( casassus et al .",
    "for another , the analysis above shows that if gas were not able to flow across the gap , the enrichment of outer solar system gas would occur more rapidly .",
    "reducing the flow of mass into the outer disk is equivalent to decreasing @xmath289 in equation 18 , but the results are not sensitive to @xmath289 : factor - of-3 enrichments occur when the gas mass is reduced by factors of 2 to 3 , regardless of @xmath289 .",
    "if the outer solar nebula disk retained significant gas after a few myr , as we argue , this would greatly speed up the growth rates of the planetary cores of saturn , uranus , and neptune ( desch 2007 ) .",
    "nevertheless , they must form after jupiter .",
    "we have argued that the time for the sun s protoplanetary disk to lose 70% of its mass was very close to the time taken by jupiter to reach its runaway accretion stage .",
    "the similarity of these timescales may seem coincidental , but is in fact supported by the observation that saturn , uranus and neptune accreted less gas than jupiter .",
    "presumably this is because the disk was substantially depleted by the time they grew large enough to initiate runaway accretion . like gh06",
    ", we would expect that the later formation of saturn , uranus and neptune would lead them to accrete nebular gas more enriched in volatiles than when jupiter grew .",
    "of course , whereas @xmath313 of jupiter s mass was accreted in its runaway atmosphere ( e.g. , lissauer et al .",
    "2009 ) , saturn , uranus and neptune are relatively more ice - rich . more so than for jupiter",
    ", the other gas giants could show two patterns of enrichment , one for species accreted in the gas phase ( as in this model ) , and another for species accreted in ices ( as in the scip model of owen et al .",
    "1999 ) . whether the gas giant planets captured noble gases from the nebular gas , or from accreting ices ,",
    "we predict that ar , kr and xe should show enrichments relative to h that are similar to each other , and probably @xmath314 .    finally , one of the most remarkable features of our model is the high mass of water vapor it predicts . our model predicts (  4.1 ) that at any instant , @xmath315 of the water ice in the outer solar nebula was in the form of water vapor ( at least initially , and for our assumed grain size distribution and other parameters ) . assuming an initial mass between 30 au and 50 au of @xmath252 , a solar composition yields @xmath316 of water ice , and @xmath4 of water vapor . because the water vapor production rate is proportional to the fuv flux , non - irradiated disks ( with @xmath317 instead of 1000 )",
