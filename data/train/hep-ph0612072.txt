    "one of the principal features of small x processes is a nontrivial interplay between the evolution in @xmath5 and in @xmath6 .",
    "it has been understood long ago that investigations of large @xmath7 processes with a large rapidity gap give principal possibility to ensure that the coupling constant is small and the evolution of the hard scale is suppressed . as a result",
    "such processes allow to investigate @xmath8 physics separately from the @xmath6 evolution .",
    "challenging qcd phenomena include transition from the regime of nuclear color transparency to color opacity and other regimes of high energy strong interaction with a small coupling constant .",
    "though the color transparency phenomenon is established experimentally in @xcite further studies are certainly necessary to establish the range of energies and virtualities for which phenomenon takes place .",
    "also , there is a number of indirect indications for onset of the regime of color opacity , a direct evidence is very limited , see however @xcite .",
    "the rapidity gap processes we discuss in this paper will provide additional handles to address these questions .    to probe this physics a number of small x processes which originate due to elastic scattering of a parton and a small quark - antiquark ( @xmath4 ) color singlet dipoles",
    "( we will refer to them in the following simply as dipoles ) at large momentum transfer and at high energies were suggested .",
    "this includes hard diffraction in @xmath9 process at large @xmath7 , production of two jets accompanied by rapidity gap - coherent pomeron @xcite , the rate of production of two back to back jets with a large rapidity gap in between @xcite as compared to the rate of two jet production in the same kinematics without rapidity gaps @xcite , photo(electro ) production of vector mesons at large t with a rapidity gap @xcite .",
    "production of two jets with a gap in between was studied experimentally at the tevatron , see e.g. @xcite . over the last ten years",
    "the theoretical and experimental studies were focused on the photo / electro production off a proton .",
    "studies of these processes at hera resulted in the measurements of the relevant cross sections @xcite in a region of the photon - proton center of mass energies @xmath10 .",
    "the hera data agree well with many ( though not all ) predictions of the qcd motivated models ( several of which use the lo bfkl approximation@xcite ) , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "clearly it would be beneficial to extend such study to higher @xmath11 and over a larger range of the rapidity gap intervals to investigate _ how energy dependence of the small dipole - parton scattering changes with t. _ recently we demonstrated @xcite that this will be possible using quasireal photons in the ultraperipheral collisions ( upc ) of protons with nuclei at lhc .",
    "here we perform a more detailed analysis focusing on study of @xmath12 meson photoproduction : @xmath13 at large t and with a rapidity gap between @xmath12-meson and produced hadronic system @xmath14 in the proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus upc at lhc .",
    "we consider the kinematics where the rapidity gap interval is sufficiently large ( @xmath15 ) to suppress contribution of the fragmentation processes .",
    "related physics can be investigated in the diffractive production of charm or two jets separated by large rapidity gap from the nucleon fragmentation region .",
    "for example , studies of the a - dependence of production of two jets in the processes like @xmath16 will allow to check presence of the color transparency effects in the gap survival in hard photon induced processes @xcite .",
    "the cms and atlas detectors are well suited for observing such processes since they cover large rapidity intervals .",
    "the main variables determining the dynamics of the process are the mass @xmath17 of system produced due to the dissociation of proton target , the square of the transfered momentum @xmath18 , and the invariant energy of the @xmath4- parton elastic scattering @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a fraction of the proton momentum carried by the parton involved in the elastic scattering off the @xmath4 pair .",
    "the rapidity gap between the produced vector meson and knocked out parton ( roughly corresponding to the leading edge of the rapidity range filled by the hadronic system @xmath14 ) is related to @xmath11 and @xmath7 ( for large @xmath21 ) as @xmath22 obviously it is rather difficult to measure the mass of diffractively produced system @xmath17 or the value of @xmath23 directly . however it can be determined with a good accuracy by measuring momenta of the particles in the system x closest to the rapidity gap .",
    "generally , the cross sections of the processes of large @xmath7 scattering with a rapidity gap are given by an incoherent sum of terms describing elastic scattering off a quark and off a gluon .",
    "each of the terms is a product of the cross section of the quasielastic large t transition @xmath24 and the corresponding parton density in the target @xcite .",
    "the choice of large @xmath7 ensures two important simplifications .",
    "first , the parton ladder mediating quasielastic scattering is attached to the projectile via two gluons .",
    "second is that attachment of the ladder to two partons of the target is strongly suppressed .",
    "the elastic cross section of the scattering off a gluon is enhanced by a factor of 81/16 as compared to the scattering off a quark .",
    "numerically , the scattering off the gluons dominates for a wide range of x. for example it constitutes @xmath25 of the cross section at x=0.1(0.3 ) .",
    "the power law for the t - dependence of the cross section is related to the number of constituents in the hadronic vertex , hence , one can expect @xmath26 for three quarks @xcite and @xmath27 for the quark - antiquark system considered in @xcite .    in the case of the photoproduction of vector mesons for the @xmath7 range @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the radius of a vector meson ) , @xmath30 , and fixed @xmath31 , the target dissociative cross section of the vector meson photoproduction off proton",

    "the amplitude of vector meson photoproduction off a quark @xmath37 is dominated by a quasielastic scattering of a photon in a small quark - antiquark dipole configuration which transits to a quark - antiquark component in the vector meson .",
    "diffractive photoproduction of vector meson from hadron(nuclear ) target is a particular case of special hard processes where evolution in @xmath23 is separated from the evolution in hard scale cf .",
    "discussions in @xcite . really , since @xmath7 which guarantees smallness of the coupling constant is the same within the ladder mediating quasielastic scattering , the amplitude @xmath38 probes evolution in @xmath39 at fixed virtuality @xmath40 .",
    "note also , that since the the momentum transfer is shared by two gluons characteristic virtualities of the t - channel gluons in the ladder are @xmath41 . at the same time",
    "hard scale characterizing structure function of a target is @xmath42 .    in the lowest order in @xmath43",
    "the elastic dipole -quark amplitude , @xmath44 , is independent of @xmath11 for any fixed @xmath7 .",
    "account of the higher order terms in @xmath45 was performed in the leading and next to leading log approximation as well as modeling effects of both logs of @xmath40 and x. it leads to expectation the solution may be given by a different saddle point @xcite .",

    "hence we will treat @xmath53 as a free parameter and assume , in most of the analysis , that @xmath53 weakly depends on @xmath7 .",
    "note that similar process for small @xmath7 could be described by the triple pomeron approximation .",
    "in this case @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the pomeron trajectory . for @xmath56",
    "this model predicts @xmath46 dropping with increase of energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2gap ]",
    "we analyze the current hera data , and propose a simple parametrization of the data based on the hard mechanism of the reaction .",
    "we also estimate the rates of @xmath57 reaction reaction in @xmath58 collisions at lhc and find that it will be possible to extend the hera measurements to the energies exceeding those reached at hera by a factor of 10 . in section [ sec3gap ] we analyze the a - dependence of the discussed process and find it will provide a critical test of the interplay between hard and soft dynamics as well as probe onset of hard black disk regime . we also find that it will be possible to reach @xmath59 in this process and hence study hard dynamics up to @xmath60 where emission of several gluons in the ladder kinematics becomes possible .",
    "the current hera measurements report cross sections integrated over @xmath17 from the minimal value @xmath62 up to some experimentally fixed upper limit of @xmath63 . at fixed @xmath7",
    "this obviously corresponds to the cross section integrated over @xmath23 from @xmath64 to the value @xmath65 determined from eq.([xmin ] ) at @xmath66 .",
    "two types of cuts are considered - @xmath67 and @xmath68 , to reveal the dynamics of the process ( [ eqvm ] ) .",
    "most of the zeus and h1 measurements explored a rather narrow interval of @xmath11 and were mostly focused on the @xmath7 dependence of the cross section .",
    "evaluation within pqcd of the transition @xmath69 shows that at large @xmath7 the cross section should be proportional to @xmath70 .",
    "the h1 collaboration presented data on the t - dependence of the cross section in the t - range @xmath71 taken at the average value @xmath72 .",
    "they measured also energy dependence of the cross section for values of @xmath73 gev@xmath74 in the range @xmath75 with the cuts on the mass of produced system @xmath76 .",

    "the scale factor @xmath84 was fixed . the phenomenological function @xmath85 which parameterizes the energy dependence of the the pqcd elastic amplitude",
    "was chosen in the form @xmath86 .",
    "values of @xmath87 and the normalization constant @xmath88 were adjusted to provide a reasonable description of the available hera data of the @xmath12 meson proton - dissociative photoproduction .",
    "this allows emission of one gluon in the ladder kinematics making it very difficult to apply a bfkl type approximation . ] .",
    "the t - dependence of cross section was measured by h1 and zeus for different cuts on the produced mass @xmath17 and rather close values of the average energy @xmath11 . as a result , these data do nt allow to fix unambigously energy dependence of the dipole - parton amplitude ( function @xmath53 ) .",
    "we obtained a reasonable description of the data assuming a relatively weak energy dependence of the amplitude @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) as well as with more strong energy dependence @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) expected for the hard processes ( see fig.[zht ] ) .",
    "we want to emphasize here that these values of @xmath53 are significantly larger that the ones which would result from extrapolation of the soft pomeron trajectory to large @xmath7 : @xmath93 even if one would introduce nonlinear term in the trajectory @xcite .",
    "our results are consistent with a rather weak variation of the energy dependence of the elastic amplitude with @xmath7 - we used the value @xmath94 while the presence of very small negative value @xmath95 will improve agreement with h1 data at large @xmath96 in the case of calculations with @xmath97 . in difference from the results of h1 and zeus analyses which found different t - dependence ( @xmath98 in the zeus experiment and @xmath99 in the h1 experiment from their fits to the data we are able to describe both data sets with the same universal expression and the same values of parameters .",
    "this is due to the different @xmath7-behavior of @xmath100 in the kinematics of zeus and h1 because of different cuts in experiments . in the first case",
    "the lower limit in integration over @xmath23 is practically constant : @xmath101 for all range @xmath102 due to the condition @xmath103 . in the h1 kinematics ( @xmath104 ) the value of integral is decreasing with increase of @xmath7 because @xmath65 increases from @xmath105 to @xmath106 .",
    "as we mentioned above in the hard regime the energy dependence of the amplitude should be a weak function of @xmath7 .",
    "in photoproduction of @xmath107 meson with rapidity gap which we consider here one needs large @xmath7 to reach dominance of the hard mechanism . however in the case of exclusive onium photo / electro production or exclusive light vector meson electroproduction at large @xmath108 one expects the hard mechanism to dominate already at @xmath109 .",
    "hence the parameter @xmath110 should be close to the energy dependence of the amplitude of exclusive process @xmath111 .",
    "at hera the highest virtualities for such amplitude are reached in the exclusive @xmath78 electroproduction and correspond to @xmath112 , for a summary see ref .",
    "hence our observation that similar value of @xmath110 allows to describe the rapidity gap data at large t gives a support to the interpretation of the data as due to hard elastic quark - antiquark dipole - parton scattering .",
    "obviously , the parameter @xmath110 could be more reliably fixed analyzing the energy dependence of cross section for fixed values of @xmath7 in a wide range of @xmath11 . such preliminary data in the range @xmath113",
    "were presented at dis06 by h1 for @xmath114 for the cut @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "this experimental cut leads to decrease of @xmath65 from @xmath116 to @xmath117 with increase of @xmath11 . under these conditions",
    "eq.([basic ] ) leads to a strong increase of the cross section due to the strong growth of integral @xmath100 with increase of @xmath11 in the range from 20 gev to 100 gev .",
    "this growth weakly depends on the value of @xmath110 ( fig.[hw ] ) .",
    "no results for the energy dependence of the process in the kinematics where @xmath17 is restricted from above by some value @xmath118 were reported by the hera experiments so far .",
    "the reported energy dependence is substantially weaker than the one given by eq .",
    "( [ basic ] ) ( fig.[hwt ] ) . for moderate @xmath7",
    "the energy dependence of the cross section is sensitive to the scale of the gluon pdf s in eq.[dglapbfkl ] .",
    "to illustrate this point we present in fig.[hwt ] the result of calculations for two choices of scale in eq.[dglapbfkl ] : @xmath40 and @xmath119 .",
    "it appears that the energy dependence of the data is described better if the scale is @xmath120 .",
    "it is not likely that further studies at hera will be able to cover a sufficiently wide range of @xmath11 and rapidity gaps necessary to study the energy dependence of the large t elastic amplitude of `` small size dipole '' - parton scattering .",
    "on the other hand at lhc cms and atlas would have large enough rapidity coverage to observe reaction ( [ eqvm ] ) in a wide range of @xmath11 and rapidity gaps in the ultraperipheral proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "hence , we use parametrization of @xmath121 cross section given by eqs.[basic ] , [ intx ] to estimate the large @xmath7 rapidity gap cross section of the @xmath12 meson photoproduction in the ultraperipheral proton - nucleus and ( in the next section ) in nucleus - nucleus collisions at lhc . for the case of proton - ion upc",
    "we do not address here a small contribution generated by @xmath122 reaction since it is much smaller and can be easily separated experimentally . hence , the large t nucleon dissociative cross section for this process will be given by expression @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the flux of photons with energy @xmath125 generated by fast moving ion with charge z and the rapidity of vector meson is determined by expression @xmath126    we considered two regimes for the @xmath12-meson photoproduction with large rapidity gap at intermediate and large momentum transfer in upc at the lhc analoguous to the ones studied at hera :    * the cross section can be studied at fixed t as a function of rapidity of the produced @xmath12 meson imposing the restriction @xmath127 . in this case",
    "the lower limit @xmath128 of integration over @xmath23 does not depend on @xmath11 and the amplitude of dipole - parton elastic scattering varies with @xmath11 due to the increase of the rapidity gap due to the increase of the rapidity of the produced vector meson .",
    "such approach could allow one to study energy dependence of the dipole - parton amplitude and determine parameter @xmath110 .",
    "* cross section is studied for @xmath129 .",
    "this type of cut is interesting since it corresponds to keeping the rapidity gap fixed and changing the value of @xmath65",
    ". such study could be useful for testing the parton distribution functions and the reaction mechanism by extracting from the data the integral @xmath130 at different values of @xmath65 and @xmath7 .",
    "note , that we do not consider here the photoproduction cross section at @xmath131 where our parametrization ( eqs .",
    "[ basic ] , [ intx ] ) based on the hera data will be hardly reliable , in particular , for a case when the produced mass is fixed by the condition @xmath132 . on the other hand",
    ", one can see from fig.[hw ] that the cross section is very small if @xmath133gev .",
    "the results of calculations for @xmath12 meson nucleon dissociative photoproduction in proton - argon and proton - lead ultraperipheral collisions at @xmath134 and @xmath135 in the kinematics of the lhc are presented in figs.[arp],[pbp ] .",
    "note here , that the cross section should drop rather slowly with t - the integrated rate for @xmath136 drops approximately as @xmath137 .",
    "one can see that with expected at the lhc luminosity of the proton - ion collisions the rates remain high up to sufficiently large @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , the rates for @xmath138 are only a factor of 10 smaller than for @xmath139 .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the rates for @xmath140 production would be also significant since though these rates for a fixed @xmath7 are smaller than for @xmath107 production , one would be able to use for the analysis @xmath141 where the discussed process gives much larger contribution than the exclusive diffractive process @xmath142 .",
    "the most of the events detected in the considered kinematics would correspond to @xmath143 , so the main information which will be possible to infer from the data would be on the energy dependence of the elastic @xmath144 amplitude for different virtualities .",
    "some number of the events can also be collected for @xmath23 as low as @xmath145 .",
    "on the other hand it will be probably very difficult to reach the @xmath146-range where scattering off quarks gives a larger contribution than scattering off gluons .",
    "overall it is clear that the energy range for the dipole - parton interactions will be large enough : @xmath147 to provide a precision measurement of the energy dependence of the amplitude .",
    "if @xmath148 , the elastic cross section should increase in this interval by a factor @xmath149 .",
    "since the large @xmath7 rapidity gap processes @xmath150 are dominated by elastic scattering of small @xmath4 pairs off partons in a target one can use these processes imbedded in nuclei to investigate in a novel way interaction of small dipoles with the nuclear medium .",
    "the ultraperipheral nucleus - nucleus collisions at lhc will provide the first opportunity to investigate physics of new qcd regime of high energy strong interaction with small coupling constant and large target thickness ( further studies will be possible at an electron - ion collider ) .",
    "the specific of nucleus - nucleus ultraperipheral collisions which differs them from the proton - nucleus collisions is that vector mesons are produced by photons emitted by both colliding nuclei .",
    "hence , the cross section is given by the sum of two contributions @xmath151 here @xmath152 is cross section of @xmath12 photoproduction off nucleus with mass number @xmath153 , @xmath14 is a product of the target nucleon diffractive dissociation and @xmath154 denotes a residual nucleus .",
    "several neutrons will be produced due to electromagnetic excitation of @xmath155 by the nucleus @xmath153 which emitted a photon involved in the reaction ( [ eqvm ] ) .",
    "the system @xmath14 should resemble the one produced in the deep inelastic scattering off a nucleus @xmath153 at similar x and @xmath156 ( except that the proportion of the scattering off gluons and quarks is different ) .",
    "the spectrum of the hadrons is given by a superposition of the processes of the fragmentation of gluons and quarks in proportion given by eq.[dglapbfkl ] .",
    "also , these hadrons should be balancing the transverse momentum of the vector meson .",
    "note here that the momenta of the leading hadrons in the rest frame of the nucleus are of the order @xmath157 .",
    "hence , based on the measurements of the emc @xcite we can expect that for large @xmath7 and for @xmath158 absorption effects for the leading hadrons are small .",
    "nevertheless , a few neutrons will be produced in the fragmentation region of the nucleus due to the final state interactions of produced hadrons@xcite .",
    "therefore in the discussed process either one or both zero degree calorimeters would detect several neutrons .",
    "detection of hadrons in the system x allows to determine which of the nuclei generated a photon , and hence determine invariant energy of the @xmath3 collision .",
    "we already mentioned that study of a - dependence of the process @xmath159 at large @xmath7 allows to reveal the dynamics of the small dipole - nucleus interaction . before discussing the expectations for a - dependence in this kinematics",
    "let us estimate what one can expect for a - dependence in the high energy nucleon dissociative @xmath12-meson photoproduction off nuclei at small @xmath7 . at high energies the process originates from the interaction of the photon in an average configuration which interacts inelastically with the strength comparable to that of @xmath12-meson .",
    "the fluctuations of the interaction strength in this case are rather small and the photoproduction cross section can be calculated using the gribov - glauber approximation for high energy incoherent processes ( note , that in quantum field theory the process is described by non - planar diagrams , see discussion below ) : @xmath160 where @xmath161 . \\label{aeffgap}\\ ] ] here @xmath162 is the nuclear density ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "the effective number of nucleons @xmath164 involved in the the process of the vector meson photoproduction off nucleus determines so called rapidity gap survival probability which can be estimated as @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the optical thickness . in the range of high energies which could be reached in @xmath12 meson photoproduction off lead at lhc growth of the cross section @xmath167 is significant and the resulting suppression becomes very large - @xmath168 , emphasizing peripheral character of the process .    at large @xmath7 the dominant component of the photon responsible for the nucleon dissociative photoproduction of vector mesons off nucleus",
    "is the quark - antiquark pair characterized by the small transverse size ( @xmath169 ) - the @xmath4 dipole .",
    "so , with increase of @xmath7 leading and higher twist nuclear shadowing effects should decrease due to color transparancy phenomenon .",
    "it has been understood long ago @xcite that the contribution of planar ( eikonal / glauber rescattering ) diagrams to the amplitude for high energy collisions is cancelled in a quantum field theory .",
    "recently this result has been generalized to pqcd for the interaction of spatially small dipole with a large size color singlet dipole via exchange by two color octet amplitudes see @xcite or via exchanges by several color singlet amplitudes@xcite . principal difference between description of scattering process within quantum mechanics and qcd as the quantum field theory is that with increase of the incident energy the dipole with an increasing probability fluctuates into configurations with a larger and larger number of constituents before the collision @xcite .",
    "each of these constituents can interact only once with a parton ( dipole ) of a target through an amplitude with vacuum quantum numbers in the crossed channel .",
    "thus account of causality and/or energy - momentum conservation leads to gribov - glauber picture but for the interaction of projectile and target described as a collection of partons - bare particles of qcd .    in the case of a small dipole - nucleus scattering the first rescattering",
    "is given by pqcd cross section for the interaction of the @xmath4 dipole of the transverse size d with the nucleon which in the leading order approximation can be written as @xcite @xmath170 here @xmath171 is the casimir operator of the fundamental representation of the @xmath172 gauge group , @xmath173 is the effective virtuality and @xmath174 . since the size of the dipole scales as @xmath175 , at sufficiently large @xmath7 and fixed @xmath11 the cross section @xmath176 become so small that one can neglect interactions with @xmath177 nucleons .",
    "then the rapidity gap survival probability can be estimated using simple expression : @xmath178 with increase of @xmath11 at fixed @xmath7 the dipole - nucleon cross section @xmath179 rapidly increases due to the growth of the small x gluon density ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "this results in breakdown of the eq.[first_order ] and one has to take into account higher order rescatterings involving @xmath177 nucleons which interact with configurations containing three ( @xmath181 ) and more partons .",
    "the cross sections of interaction with such configurations should be larger than @xmath182 given by eq.([sigma_d_dglap ] ) because the projectile with a significant probability effectively consists of several dipoles of sizes comparable to the size of the initial dipole .",
    "hence the eikonal type expansion of the amplitude over the number of rescatterings based on the averaged strength of interaction will obviously somewhat overestimate the the absorption .",
    "still it appears reasonable to use the eikonal approximation for the rough estimate of the magnitude of the suppression . in particular , in fig.[gapsup ] we show calculation of @xmath183 as a function of @xmath184 which one can consider as a parameter modeling the averaged strength of dipole - nucleon interaction in nuclear medium .",
    "the accuracy of such estimates of @xmath183 should be better both in the limit of small @xmath184 when @xmath185 terms give a small correction ( @xmath186 for @xmath187 ) and for large @xmath188 where interaction is close to the bdr .    clearly ,",
    "increase of t at fixed energy leads to @xmath189 revealing the onset of color transparency .",
    "however for @xmath190 typical for upc collisions at lhc and for upper range of hera a dipole of transverse size d=0.2 fm ( which may correspond to @xmath191 ) interacts with a cross section @xmath192 leading to @xmath183 substantially smaller than one ( see fig . [ gapsup ] ) , and a=200 , eq.([first_order ] ) leads to @xmath193 a factor of 1.6 smaller than eq.([aeffgapav ] ) ] .",
    "hence one probably would need a larger @xmath7 , or smaller @xmath11 to reach the regime of complete color transparency given by eq.([ct ] ) below .",
    "overall , we expect that at fixed @xmath7 increase of energy will gradually lead to the onset of the regime of color opacity . at sufficiently high energies",
    "one is likely to reach a black disk regime ( bdr ) for interaction of the dipole with the nuclear medium and the vector meson photoproduction would be strongly suppressed for central impact parameters , leading to dominance of the peripheral process with the cross section proportional to @xmath194 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that suppression of the @xmath12-meson yield in this case would be comparable to the one in the soft regime which we discussed above and could be estimated using eq.([aeffgapav ] ) .",
    "higher twist effects in this kinematics would be manifested also in the structure of the final state . due to a more peripheral nature of the higher twist mechanism large suppression of the a - dependence",
    "would be combined with a smaller break up of the nucleus which could be measured via study of the multiplicity of neutrons in the zdc .    in the leading twist approximation",
    "the cross section of vector meson photoproduction off nuclear target is given by eq .",
    "[ dglapbfkl ] where parton distributions within a nucleon are substituted by nuclear parton density distributions @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 @xmath198 } , \\label{ct}\\ ] ] where @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 are the nuclear parton distributions .",
    "it is known experimentally that quark distributions for @xmath199 do not deviate from the linear dependence by more than 10% . for the gluons ( which dominate in eq .",
    "[ ct ] ) some current models predict an enhancement of up to 20% for @xmath200 which maybe followed by some suppression at @xmath146 .",
    "hence the leading twist approximation of eq .",
    "[ ct ] leads to the prediction of the onset of color transparency regime with increase of @xmath7 , which is characterized by a strong suppression of the interaction of small dipole with nuclear medium .",
    "then the upper limit of the photoproduction cross section can be obtained in the impulse approximation ( ia ) @xmath201    note that studies of the discussed process at @xmath202 allow to trigger on scattering of a high energy photon in a small @xmath4 configuration without requiring that interaction involves scattering off the small x gluon field .",
    "this is in contrast with e.g. elastic photo / electro production of an onium state off nuclei .",
    "accordingly this process provides a complementary clean way to study a pattern of the interactions of a small dipole with nuclear medium in a wide range of energies .    of separate interest is the kinematics with @xmath17 corresponding to @xmath203 where one expects a significant leading twist gluon shadowing of structure functions ( the quark contribution in this kinematics is negligible ) - on the scale of a factor of @xmath204 for @xmath205@xcite",
    "this should result in additional decrease of @xmath183 , hence , when @xmath23 becomes @xmath206 one would be addressing an interplay of the leading and higher twist effects in the dipole - parton interaction and the dipole - nuclear medium interactions .    for numerical estimates of the rates of the discussed process at lhc we considered two scenarios - a color transparency regime of cross section proportional to a - the impulse approximation and regime of strong absorption which can be considered as a lower limit on the expected cross section .",
    "we made a natural assumption that absorption for the interaction of a small dipole for a given energy should not exceed the one for the interaction of a hadron build of same quarks .",
    "accordingly we used eq.([aeffgapav ] ) with @xmath167 calculated basing on the fit of @xcite for elastic @xmath12 meson photoproduction off proton and the vector dominance model .    comparing to a proton - nucleus case two options of restricting the mass @xmath17 of produced system",
    "were slightly modified to take into account correctly the low energy photoproduction that is necessary because of two - side specifics of the symmetric nucleus - nucleus ultraperipheral collisions .",
    "so , we considered variation of the upper limit of @xmath17 with increase of the photon - nucleon cm energy @xmath11 as @xmath76 .",
    "as a second option we used combined approach : @xmath76 until @xmath207 and fixed upper limit @xmath208 at higher energies ( central rapidities ) .",
    "we present the results of our calculations of the nucleon - dissociative @xmath12 meson photoproduction cross section in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions at lhc for a few values of the squared momentum transfer in figs .",
    "[ art2i5],[art5],[pbt2i5],[pbt5 ] .",
    "one can see that for heavy nuclei suppression may reduce the cross section by a factor of ten and more .",
    "so the reduction depends strongly on the value of @xmath4 dipole interaction with nucleons and , hence , these processes are very sensitive to higher twist effects . even in the case of large screening effects , the rates would be large enough up to @xmath209 ( see fig.[t10 ] ) and it would be doable to study how the screening effects are reduced with increase of @xmath7 .",
    "this information would be complementary to the information about energy dependence of the elastic small dipole - parton amplitude which is studied in the scattering off protons .",
    "to summarize , we have have found that the hera data suggest a much faster energy dependence of the dipole - parton amplitude than in the soft dynamics .",
    "however the cuts used by the experiments make it difficult a direct determination of this energy dependence .",
    "we demonstrated that the study of the processes with rapidity gaps being feasible in upc at lhc will allow a direct measurement of important property of the pqcd - energy dependence of the large t elastic amplitude of dipole - parton scattering . in the case of @xmath12 meson production off nuclei we argued that there exist several different regimes of a - dependences related to the transition from a soft regime to the color transparency regime with increase of @xmath210 for fixed @xmath211 and from color transparency to color opacity regimes for fixed @xmath7 and increase of @xmath11 , to an interplay of the leading and higher twist effects which is a nontrivial function of the rapidity gap interval .",
    "all together this provides a new powerful tool for studying the small dipole interaction with the media .",
