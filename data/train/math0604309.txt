    "strange nonchaotic attractors ( sna ) are attractors of dynamical systems which have some form of local contraction , but which also have a complicated or fractal structure ( hence the word ` strange ' ) . in the context of quasiperiodically forced maps , i.e. maps of the form @xmath0 for @xmath1 , @xmath2 irrational , @xmath3 in some suitable metric space @xmath4 and fiber maps @xmath5 defined by @xmath6 ,",
    "this notion is used for compact invariant sets which are the topological closure of a non - continuous invariant graph with negative lyapunov exponents in the fibers ( see remark  [ rmk : sna ] for the precise definition ) .",
    "the negative lyapunov exponent in the @xmath7directiondirection associated to the corresponding invariant measure is always zero . ]",
    "provides local contraction and the topological entropy of the system is zero .",
    "these two conditions are generally considered sufficient to justify calling the attractors nonchaotic , and the first one ensures that there is local exponential convergence to the attractor in almost all fibers of constant @xmath8 . moreover",
    ", many authors remark that this implies that there is no exponential sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "it has also been observed that the existence of a sna implies that finite time lyapunov exponents can be positive @xcite , and that this chaotic - like property is responsible for the lack of smooth invariant curves .    in this paper",
    "we consider the chaotic - like properties of sna in quasiperiodically forced systems in more detail .",
    "we focus on the property of sensitive dependence on initial conditions ( _ sdic _ ) , which has been regarded as one of the hallmarks of chaos , and show that many sna have this property . by _ sdic _   we mean the classic topological definition as in devaney @xcite which does not impose any conditions on rates of separation . to be precise",
    ", the standard definition is as follows .",
    "let @xmath9 be a metric space with metric @xmath10 . a map @xmath11 has sensitive dependence on initial conditions ( _ sdic _ ) iff there exists @xmath12 such that for all @xmath13 and @xmath14 there exists @xmath15 and @xmath16 depending on @xmath17 and @xmath18 such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this was one of the three conditions for chaos introduced by devaney @xcite , although it was later shown that it is implied by the other two conditions ( transitive and dense periodic orbits ) @xcite and so , as glasner and weiss observe @xcite , devaney s definition is too weak to be considered as a good definition of chaotic dynamics . on the other hand",
    "it is certainly a feature associated with chaos , and the presence of this property in snas emphasizes their position on the cusp between regular and chaotic systems .",
    "it is also worth noting that quasiperiodically forced systems can not be chaotic in the sense of devaney because since @xmath2 is irrational there are no periodic orbits .",
    "the definition of _ sdic _  given above leaves some latitude in the choice of the space @xmath9 .",
    "first of all , it is natural to consider the dynamics restricted to the attractor , thus choosing @xmath21 , and this is investigated in section three .",
    "another obvious choice is to set @xmath9 to be the whole space on which the system is defined , i.e.@xmath22 , and this will be treated in section four .",
    "the difference between these choices is reflected in changes in the set of points in a neighbourhood of any point .",
    "it is one of the most interesting aspects of snas that the measure - theoretic and topological point of view often separate , and properties which are generic in the one sense are degenerate in the other and vice versa .",
    "for example , it usually makes a great difference whether the measure - theoretic or the topological support of an invariant measure is considered , and there are situations where the former has a very complicated structure while the later is just a smooth torus . in order to fully understand the behavior of quasiperiodically forced maps",
    "it is often necessary to combine both viewpoints , and this is explains that while the focus of this paper lies on the topological side , measures will inevitably make an appearance .",
    "( on a technical level this happens via the results of glasner and weiss @xcite , for which we included a version of the proof , with a strongly simplified measure - theoretic part in section two . )",
    "one of the most studied classes of sna arise in pinched skew products .",
    "these are systems ( [ qp ] ) for which there exists at least one value of @xmath23 , @xmath24 say , such that @xmath25 for all @xmath26 . in other words",
    ", at least one fiber of constant @xmath8 is mapped to a single point , the pinched point .",
    "these systems include some of the original examples suggested by @xcite , and are one of the few classes of systems for which it is possible to prove rigorous results about the existence and structure of snas @xcite .",
    "it is not hard to adapt the results of @xcite to pinched skew products which satisfy three natural conditions to prove :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if @xmath27 is the attractor of a pinched skew product @xmath28 satisfying the conditions  of section three and @xmath27 is not a continuous graph then @xmath29 has _ sdic _   on @xmath27 . in particular ,",
