    "in our previous work@xcite , we have proposed a two - stage electron acceleration model to identify the sources of super - high energetic electrons at relativistic laser pre - formed plasma interactions .",
    "the first stage is the synergetic acceleration by longitudinal charge separation electric field and pondermotive forces of reflected laser pulses .",
    "a scaling law of the maximal possible electron energy by the first stage acceleration is obtained by solving the motions of electrons in the presence of two cross - propagating laser pulses and an external electric field with limited extension .",
    "the fast electrons pre - accelerated by the first stage could expand freely , building an intense electrostatic potential barrier with the potential energy several times as large of the electron kinetic energy .",
    "some of the electrons could be reflected by this potential barrier , with the finial electron kinetic cut - off energy several times higher than their initial values .    in this work ,",
    "we have studied the role of circularly polarized ( cp ) laser pulses at relativistic laser - solid interaction in the presence of large - scale plasmas .",
    "there is definitely no doubt that without pre - formed plasmas in front of the solid target , cp laser - solid interaction is a hot - electron - free process , because of the absence of @xmath4 effect .",
    "as an extension of our previous work , we focus on the phenomena of cp laser - plasma interaction at relativistic intensity and in the presence of large - scale pre - plasmas .",
    "the computer simulation method is exactly the same as previously@xcite , only changing the incident laser pulse from linearly polarized ( lp ) to cp and keeping other parameters the same .",
    "it is found that super - high energetic electrons can be generated by cp laser .",
    "for laser of intensity @xmath0 and pre - plasma scale - length @xmath1 , the cut - off kinetic energy of accelerated electrons by cp laser is @xmath2 compared with @xmath3 in the case of lp laser@xcite .",
    "the source of these unexpected super - high energetic electrons can also be explained by the two - stage electron acceleration model@xcite . we have found that the envelop of the reflected cp laser becomes periodically modulated .",
    "here we call it modulated - cp laser instead of cp laser and ep laser , because both its `` polarization direction '' and amplitude ( or laser envelop ) vary with time . for the pure cp laser ,",
    "whose ponderomotive force is zero , the synergetic acceleration in the first stage is of no effect at all .",
    "however the envelop of the reflected wave is modulated , and this is enough to turn on the mechanism we are considering .",
    "a modified scaling law related to the first stage acceleration is obtained , showing that at certain circumstance , cp laser can be more efficient than lp laser at super - high energetic electron generation .",
    "the underlying physics of this envelop modulation is also addressed and figured out .",
    "relativistic laser - solid interaction at pico - second duration in the presence of large - scale pre - formed plasmas is of significant effects on many applications@xcite , such as fast ignition and bright x - ray sources , et al .",
    "understanding the source of fast electrons is of great importance to these related researches@xcite .",
    "simulation method and parameters are exactly the same as our previous work@xcite , but changing the incident laser from lp to cp .",

    "we have placed two diagnostic planes to temporally record the electrons passing through to analyse the electron energy spectra .",

    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) shows the electron energy spectra by cp lasers collected at @xmath12 , indicating that with the increase of pre - formed plasma scale - length , the electron acceleration efficiency is also increasing , which shares the same trend as that of lp lasers . the black lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) shows that the cut - off electron energy collected at @xmath11 is @xmath17 while that recorded at @xmath12 is @xmath2 , which also shares the same behaviour as that of lp lasers .",
    "compared with the red triangles and black triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) , we found that although the @xmath4 signals are significantly suppressed by cp lasers , the cut - off electron energy by cp laser is obviously higher than that by lp laser .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) shows space - time evolution of the electron density driven by cp laser . it is obvious that electrons are firstly accelerated backward ( -z direction ) and then pulled forward entering into the solid target . from fig .  [ fig2 ] ( a ) , we can also find that the backward emissions of the electrons include both isolated bunches and continuous beams .",
    "as we have analysed previously@xcite , both multi - isolated - electron - bunches and continuous electron beams can build up intense electrostatic potential barrier with its value several times as large of the electron initial kinetic energy .",
    "when some of the electron are reflected by the large potential barrier and return back , their final kinetic energies will be several times as large of their initial values .",
    "the two - stage acceleration process is also clearly confirmed by fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) .",

    "red and green lines are the corresponding @xmath18 and @xmath19 components.,width=283 ]",
    "it is well known that the ponderomotive force of plane cp laser is zero .",
    "if the reflected laser pulse is of cp , the first stage acceleration of our two - stage acceleration model is of no effect .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the z - propagating laser electric fields and -z - propagating electric fields .",
    "we found that although the incident laser is cp , the reflected one becomes envelop modulated , where the wave number ( frequency ) of the modulation is @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and modulation depth is @xmath22 .",
    "we thus call this kind of pulse envelop modulated - cp laser .    to further understand the source of this envelop modulation , we go to the detailed space - time evolution located at the reflection point , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we find that the oscillation periods of electron density , charge separation field and electromagnetic field energy are also at @xmath25 , and they keep in step with each other .",

    "this is the case for direct cp laser - solid interactions .",
    "however , when there exists large - scale pre - plasmas in front of the solid target , the balance condition will vary with time , when electron leaves the reflection point , the charge separation field therein is lowered and when electrons return back to the reflection point , the charge separation field therein will increase .",
    "actually , the oscillation period of the reflection point can be attributed to the circulating time of electrons in the two stage acceleration process .",
    "the dominant oscillation period is determined by the circulating time of the majority of electrons , which is @xmath27 of the emitting electron beam ( appendix a ) . due to the ponderomotive force",
    ", a sharp density gradient is built at the reflection point , with the density of the reflection wall @xmath28 .",
    "an energy flux balance condition @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 at ultra high intensities and @xmath31 ) may then be used to estimate the `` initial '' density of electron beams , which usually is on the order of @xmath32@xcite , consistently with the argument that @xmath33 can not exceed the density of the reflection point where hot electrons are generated .",
    "as electron mass is increase to @xmath34 ( @xmath35 for laser of intensity @xmath0 with wavelength @xmath36 ) , the @xmath27 can be calculated to be @xmath37 , and the oscillation period is @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , the modulational ( m ) and raman ( rs ) instability , may also play role in this process .",
    "it was shown that@xcite , for the relativistic cp laser radiation with @xmath39 and homogeneous density close to relativistic critical , one can not distinguish these ( m and rs ) different modes , and the wave numbers of unstable modes have a broad range .",
    "while in our case , plasma is inhomogeneous rather strongly , so that if the existing conclusions match our cases need another further study .",
    "the oscillation of the reflection point will modulate the reflected cp laser .",
    "this kind of modulation can also take place in cp laser driven electrostatic shock acceleration of ions@xcite , and they share the same physics in this work ( appendix b ) . as @xmath40 is a lorenz invariant , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the velocity of the reflection point , it is easy to see that the oscillation period of the reflection point should be equal to the modulation period of the reflected cp laser .",

    "the mechanism we proposed can still work under the fact that reflected cp laser is envelop modulated . following the method we have developed previously@xcite and considering @xmath48 with @xmath49 determining the `` polarization ratio '' of the reflected modulated - cp pulse , we can find the maximal - possible energy gain within the limited longitudinal scale length @xmath50 and the maximal in - phase time @xmath51 , which is picked up from fig .",
