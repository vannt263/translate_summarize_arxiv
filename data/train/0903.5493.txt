    "in the last two decades , developments in infrared ( ir ) technologies , such as @xmath2 arrays and the mid - ir _ spitzer space telescope _ , have enabled large - scale studies of star formation processes in molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "imaging surveys in the rosette region are unavoidably contaminated by the overwhelming field star populations . therefore ,",
    "identification of young embedded populations has relied on selecting stars with ir color excesses produced by dusty circumstellar disks . because the many diskfree pre - main sequence stars ( pms ) ( weak - lined t tauri stars , wtts ) that are cluster members can not be identified in this way",

    "pms stars both with and without disks are well - known to emit x - rays that can penetrate the heavy extinction of gmcs @xcite .",
    "the level of x - ray emission from young stellar populations is elevated @xmath9 times above the levels of x - ray emission from the old galactic disk population @xcite . as a consequence , x - ray observations , particularly with the high spatial resolution _ chandra x - ray observatory _",

    "@xmath10 images provide remarkably complete and unbiased pms populations with subarcsecond positions .",

    "source # 65 is too bright ( @xmath31 ) for its spectral type ( g0 ) at the rmc s distance , leading to its classification as a foreground star .",

    "the sensitivity limits of our x - ray observations are spatially uneven due to the patchy absorption in the rmc and to degraded point spread function ( psf ) of the _ chandra _ mirrors at large off - axis angles . based on previous experience with wavelet source detection and the acis extract software @xcite",

    "the left and right panels show maps with 3 and 2 radius ( 1.2 and 0.8  pc ) smoothing kernels , respectively .",
    "three large - scale structures are seen as overdensities in the total sample , irrespective of the adopted smoothing kernel size .",
    "we define these regions as xa , xb , and xc and trace their outline from a contour of the 3 kernel .",
    "we note seven small - scale overdensities within the three major structures in the 2 map of the total population .",
    "we label these xa1-xa3 , xb1-xb3 , and xc1 .",
    "in addition , a distinct substructure of heavily obscured stars extending southward from xc1 is seen in panel figure  [ fig : ch5_ssd]@xmath92 which we call xc2 .",
    "note that the substructures are defined from smoothed contours on different maps and are not contiguous ; the star totals in the main structures are thus larger than the sum of the stars in the substructures .",
    "we label stars lying outside all overdensities `` distributed '' stars in the rmc .    while the regions are defined based on subjectively chosen surface density contours , we are confident that these structures are not artifacts caused by the slightly degraded x - ray sensitivities at large off - axis angles on the acis - i ccds .",
    "the overdensities are not located at the centers of the fields ( where the telescope response is maximized ) and represent a factor of @xmath93 difference in stellar density which can not be solely attributed to the instrumental sensitivity gradients .      a second technique for identifying stellar clusters is analysis of the distribution of nearest neighbors @xcite .",
    "this was used by refl08 to establish the content of the seven pl97 clusters in the @xmath2 catalog of the rmc .",
    "we apply the same nearest neighbor method used by refl08 based on the local density derived from the distances to the 10 nearest neighbors to each star .",
    "contours of the resulting nearest neighbor maps for our _ chandra _ rmc observations are shown in figure  [ fig : chandra_contour ] for the total , unobscured , and obscured populations .",
    "the locations and morphologies of the resulting concentrations closely resemble the structures that we defined using the smoothed surface density maps for x - ray sources .",
    "this indicates the robustness of the inferred clustering irrespective of the methodology used to smooth the star distribution .",
    "the maps shown in figure  [ fig : ch5_ssd ] used all detected x - ray sources .",
    "however , the sensitivity across the field is not uniform ; there is a bias towards detecting faint sources in the area close to the individual field aim points and in the overlapping regions with deeper exposure .",
    "it is possible that this sensitivity variations can create spurious structure in an intrinsically smooth distribution of sources .",
    "we evaluate the importance of this effect by creating a smoothed source map similar to figure  [ fig : ch5_ssd ] which removes the sensitivity degradation due to telescope vignetting , effective exposure and background across the fields .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we estimate the sensitivity across the x - ray imaging mosaic assuming a poisson model .",
    "the resulting relation can be approximately represented by @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the required number of counts for a source required to be detected , and @xmath96 is the background counts measured in a local region .",
    "the coefficients are obtained by constructing a lower envelope in the plot of _ net full _ counts against _ bkgd full _",
    "counts tabulated in table  [ tbl : ch5_primary ] .",
    "we then construct a sensitivity map across the mosaic by dividing a smoothed map of @xmath95 by the telescope exposure maps in units of @xmath97 s ( shown in figure  [ fig : expmap ] , see also appendix of tfm03 ) .",
    "the resulting sensitivity map is typically @xmath98 counts @xmath17 s@xmath24 near the aimpoint and @xmath99 near the edge of a typical 20  ks field .",
    "it reaches @xmath100 in a small region around subcluster xa1 where the field overlaps the much deeper @xmath3100  ks exposure of ngc  2244 discussed in paper  i.    this corresponds to a @xmath38  counts limit across the 20  ks exposures and @xmath340  counts in the overlapping region around xa1 . applying this spatially varying counts threshold removes the sensitivity bias from telescope degradation and overlapping fields , and provides a complete sub - sample of our x - ray detections .",
    "this procedure removes 30% of the weaker sources in table  1 ( the remaining sources with number of counts above the detection threshold are marked in table  1 , see table footnote ) .",
    "the smoothed stellar surface density map of this reduced , spatially uniform sample is shown in figure  [ fig : uniform_contour ] .",
    "the three major x - ray clusters , xa , xb , and xc , are present as prominent overdensities .",

    "it shows that these same four substructures ",
    "xb2 , xb3 , xc1 , and xc2are associated with dense molecular regions .",
    "x - ray cluster xa , on the other hand , lies in the evacuated region on the eastern side of the h@xmath86-bright rosette pdr . located in the north - west side of the north - westernmost acis field where molecular material has been removed by the expanding hii region , its stars",
    "are less obscured compared to the xb and xc concentrations embedded in the molecular cloud .",
    "this is shown in columns @xmath106 of table  [ tbl : cls_counts ] : 30% of xa stars have @xmath107 kev , corresponding to absorption @xmath108 @xmath17 or @xmath109 , compared to @xmath110% in concentrations xb and xc .",
    "most xa stars are concentrated in subcluster xa3 centered at ( @xmath86 , @xmath111 ) = ( 06:32:38,+04:46:18 ) . xa1 and xa2 represent small extensions to the northwest and southwest , respectively .",
    "sixty - one stars are in the xa x - ray sample . scaling by the incompleteness factor for lightly obscured regions given in   [ sec : sensitivity ] , the estimated total stellar population in xa is 300 stars .",
    "this is about 15% of the total population estimated for the central ngc  2244 cluster using the same xlf - based method ( @xmath32000 ; paper i ) .",
    "the lightly absorbed xa cluster was not clearly identified in previous ir surveys of the cloud .",
    "the location of substructure xa1 is separated by @xmath12  from iras 06297 + 0453 .",
    "however a close inspection of iras , dss , and 2mass images led us to conclude that this is a spatial coincidence : iras 06297 + 0453 is associated with the very bright foreground k0v star bd + 04 1304 ( @xmath112 , @xmath113 ) and does not belong to the rmc .",
    "the xa cluster was not covered in the earlier pl97 survey .",
    "six stars with @xmath6-band excesses are present in the flamingos survey ( table   [ tbl : cls_counts ] ) , insufficient to highlight a cluster using the 10th - nearest neighbor method .",
    "however , it does appear as an enhancement in the smoothed surface density map of all 2mass sources shown by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figures 1a and 2a ) , appearing as a stellar enhancement between xb and the main ngc  2244 cluster .",
    "a group of 32 stars with disky mir spectral energy distributions is found within our xa contour in the @xmath7 irac / mips , but again these were not identified as a distinct cluster by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figures 6b ) .",
    "rather they appear as an eastward extension of the central ngc 2244 cluster .",
    "the cluster is more spatially distinct from the main cluster in the acis x - ray mosaic of @xmath320ks pointings towards ngc 2244 and rmc ( see figure 6a in tfm03 ) , which is not sensitive to obscuration .",
    "the reason that the xa cluster emerges more clearly in our x - ray survey than in infrared surveys is probably due to presence of nebular contamination .",
    "it lies on a bright ridge of enhanced h brackett-@xmath86 and spatially variable pah emission ( figures 1 and 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "these contaminants limit the detection or photometric accuracy of stars in certain infrared bands which then inhibits identification of disk emission from multiband spectral energy distributions .",
    "as noted above and in table  [ tbl : cls_comparison ] , the xb and xc concentrations of x - ray stars shown in figures  [ fig : ch5_ssd ] and  [ fig : chandra_contour ] correspond to embedded clusters established from @xmath70 , 2mass , flamingos , and @xmath7 studies .",
    "their stellar populations inferred from nir studies have been most thoroughly described by rl08 .",
    "the xb and xc clusters have higher fractions of obscured stars than the xa cluster ( 46% and 41% @xmath114 30% ; table  [ tbl : cls_counts ] ) .",
    "this , combined with their spatial relationship to dense molecular structures ( figure  [ fig : co_ir ] ) confirms that they are at least partly embedded in cloud material .",
    "the main advantage of our x - ray survey is that disk - free ( pms class  iii ) members are readily detected , subject only to the sensitivity limitations given in   [ sec : sensitivity ] . in most infrared surveys , class  iii systems can not be readily distinguished from the strong contamination of galactic field stars .",
    "infrared surveys are thus often limited to counting disky ( pms class  i and ii ) systems .",
    "the x - ray samples are thus usually larger than the ir - excess samples , and provide a less biased way to estimate disk fractions which is relevant to stellar ages .",
    "the xb cluster is the sparsest of the three x - ray concentrations with 52 detected stars and an estimated total population of 200 stars ( table  [ tbl : cls_counts ] ) .",
    "it has an `` l''-shaped structure with three subcomponents of similar ( @xmath33  pc ) sizes .",
    "subcluster xb2 associated with @xmath7 cluster c @xcite appears more embedded than the other subclusters .",
    "subcluster xb3 is associated with nir cluster pl  2 and mir source iras 06306 + 0437 . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : rmcx89 ] above , this structure is dominated by the embedded massive star , rmcx  # 89 .",
    "both xb1 and xb2 contain bright msx mid - ir sources ( see footnotes to table  [ tbl : ch5_counterparts ] ) .",
    "the xc cluster is the richest of the three main x - ray structures in the cloud with 160 detected stars . in the principal concentration of stars , xc1 ,",
    "roughly 2/3 are lightly obscured and 1/3 are heavily obscured .",
    "this rich cluster was first noted in @xmath115-band imaging by @xcite , studied spectroscopically in @xcite , and noted as a nir cluster by pl97 , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the sparser xc2 component is only evident in the stellar surface density maps for the obscured population ( figure   [ fig : ch5_ssd]@xmath116 and @xmath92 ) indicating it is deeply embedded .",
    "this region also appears much darker in the dss optical image .",
    "it appears as a curved southern extension of the rich xc1 cluster in the x - ray maps , and is associated with the nir clusters pl  5 , refl  8 , and the @xmath7 cluster e ( table  [ tbl : cls_comparison ] ) . the stellar structure may extend beyond the southeastern edge of our acis field .",
    "in contrast to xc1 , only 1/4 of the stars in xc2 are lightly obscured as measured by the @xmath32 indicator of soft x - ray absorption .",
    "xc2 is thus the most deeply embedded stellar cluster in the rmc regions we examine here .",
    "x - ray properties can not discriminate very young clusters , dominated by accreting class i - ii systems , from older clusters , dominated by non - accreting class iii systems .",
    "the reason for this is well - established : the x - ray luminosity function and flaring properties do not greatly change as low mass stars evolve from their class i through iii phases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray selected samples are thus relatively unbiased with respect to age , and their ages can then be estimated from their rapidly evolving infrared properties . here",
    "we focus on the high - quality @xmath2 photometry available from the flamingos survey ( refl08 ) for x - ray sources within the boundaries of clusters xa , xb , and xc presented above .",

    "the region between the left two dashed lines is associated with class  iii objects ( diskless wtts ) reddened by interstellar extinction . to the right of this band",
    "are sources exhibiting significant @xmath6-band excess ; here we require @xmath119 based on flamingos photometric errors for the sources to be k - band excess stars .",
    "the region between the middle and right - most dashed lines is occupied by class  ii objects ( pms stars with circumstellar accretion disks ) , and protostars still possessing thick envelopes ( class  i objects ) lie beyond the right - most dashed line .",
    "star counts in various regions are summarized in the middle columns of table  [ tbl : cls_counts ] .",
    "the colors of most sources in cluster xa are consistent with pms stars with small reddening , @xmath120 , typical of stars in the central ngc  2244 cluster illuminating the rosette nebula ( paper  i ) .",
    "a few class ii sources are present showing higher @xmath121 ; these may lie within xa or behind xa in the molecular cloud .",
    "sources in cluster xb show a wide range of absorptions ; some sources are reddened with @xmath122 and the @xmath6-excess sources are among the most reddened .",
    "this may suggest the xb subclusters are distributed along the line of sight , at different cloud depths .",
    "three class  i sources are found in this region . despite the smaller number of sources in region xb",
    ", it has more ir - excess sources than the more populous xa region .",
    "subcluster xb1 has 11 detected x - ray stars with an inferred total population around 40 stars , but has no ir - excess systems .",
    "xb2 has more mir - excess than nir - excess stars , while xb3 has more nir - excess than mir - excess stars .",
    "we thus tentatively infer that the xb region is not homogeneous and coeval .",
    "subcluster xb3 , which includes rmcx  # 89 = iras 06306 + 0437 discussed in   [ sec : rmcx89 ] , is clearly the youngest structure in the region as the presence of nir excess in the stars indicates inner disks have not been cleared yet .",
    "x - ray sources in cluster xc are mostly lightly obscured pms stars with @xmath123 and a dozen heavily obscured sources with @xmath124 .",
    "the xc cluster is very populous in the x - ray map , and only 5 - 10% of these stars have infrared excesses in the nir or mir bands .",
    "this , together with the presence of only one very young system in figure  [ fig : co_ir ] , indicates that the region is not dominated by active star formation today despite the presence of two @xmath70 sources resolved into several ir clusters ( pl  4 , pl  5 , refl  8 and @xmath7 s e ) .",
    "the very faint xc source rmcx  # 315 is associated with a faint nir source with unusual colors , @xmath125 ; it is either a class  i system or a very heavily reddened class  ii system .",
    "nir @xmath126 vs.  @xmath117 color - magnitude diagrams shown in figure  [ fig : ch5_cmd ] provide an approximate range of the mass distribution and local absorptions for the same stars shown in figure  [ fig : ch5_ccd ] .",
    "no candidate new ob stars appear in the rmc nir color - magnitude diagram .",
    "this stands in marked contrast to @xmath10 studies of other prominent star forming regions where dozens of new obscured ob stars were identified by virtue of their x - ray emission .",
    "these include westerlund  1 @xcite , and rcw  38 @xcite , ngc  6357 @xcite , rcw  108 @xcite .",
    "there is no reason to believe that massive star formation is suppressed in the rmc ; more likely the population of the individual embedded cluster is simply too small to contain massive stars as expected from the initial mass function .",
    "we conclude that cluster xa , showing less absorption and very few ir - excess stars , appears older than clusters xb and xc .",
    "the latter structures are not unified , homogeneous clusters but rather collections of smaller stellar concentrations .",
    "similar to the results of refl08 , we find no clear spatial pattern of cluster ages in this region .",
    "xc is the most populous and , with only @xmath127% fraction of ir - excess sources and no more than one protostar , is not very young .",
    "active star formation is strongest in subcluster xb2 with several protostars including the massive system rmcx  # 89 = iras 06306 + 0437 .",
    "figure  [ fig : co_ir ] shows the x - ray selected rmc stars , classified by evolutionary stage from the nir color - color diagram (   [ sec : clusevol ] ) , superposed on contours representing @xmath128co emission @xcite .",
    "the younger class i and ii sources are mostly seen around the co molecular ridge near cluster xb and the molecular material near cluster xc .",
    "class iii stars appear more dispersed throughout the cloud and dominate the xa region where molecular material is no longer present .",
    "we can interpret this trend as reflecting the drifting of older class iii stars away from their birth sites @xcite .",
    "for example , with a characteristic transverse speed of @xmath31 km s@xmath24 , a star would travel 1 pc ( @xmath129 ) in 1 myr .",
    "this is sufficient to disperse such stars originally formed in the clusters throughout the @xmath10 fields in a few myrs , resulting in a `` dispersed '' population .",
    "the relationship of cluster xa to molecular gas is clearly different than for clusters xb and xc .",
    "xa lies within the bright nebulosity of the rosette hii region where most of the molecular materials are gone .",
    "this cluster of less embedded and older pms stars ( see   [ sec : clusevol ] ) is likely an early population triggered by the expansion of the hii region .",
    "its similarity to ngc  2237 , a similar lightly obscured cluster on the western side of the rosette nebula , will be discussed in our paper iii ( wang et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the overdensity of stars in xb , including the nir pl  2 cluster , is situated on the ` rim ' of molecular material adjacent to the expanding rosette pdr .",
    "it includes xb2 , the youngest subcluster in our examined portion of the rmc .",
    "this cluster , and possibly the similar pl  1 cluster located south - west of our @xmath10 fields in a molecular clump , are reasonably interpreted as triggered by the expanding shell of the ngc  2244 hii region .",
    "the molecular clumps are probably undergoing photoevaporation and will eventually become unobscured clusters like region xa .",
    "region xc contains the large and most extended population of embedded stars , including several infrared clusters .",
    "its relationship to a dense molecular clump has been noted by @xcite and refl08 . our analysis above (   [ sec : clusevol ] )",
    "suggests that subcluster xc1 ( pl  4 ) is partially emerging from the molecular core while xc2 is younger and still embedded . as discussed by refl08 and @xcite ,",
    "it is not clear that star formation here has been triggered by the expanding hii region .",
    "since the x - ray sample provides an estimate of the total stellar population of each cluster , we can roughly estimate the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) of molecular material in the rmc .",
    "@xcite estimate the molecular masses of 70 clumps in the rmc using an empirical co - to - h@xmath130 ratio @xmath131 @xmath132 molecules @xmath17 ( k km s@xmath24)@xmath24 .",
    "mass estimates are made assuming either local thermodynamic equilibrium or gravitational binding of gas motions within clumps .",
    "if we assume an average stellar mass of 0.4  m@xmath45 @xcite , the sfe @xmath133 is approximately 15% in region xb and 11% in region xc , adopting the lte clump masses .",
    "if the gravitational clump masses in @xcite are used , the sfe becomes 24% and 32% in xb and xc , respectively .",
    "these values are similar to the sfes inferred for nearby embedded rich clusters : ngc  2071 ( sfe@xmath13412% ) and ngc  2024 ( 33% ) in the orion molecular cloud @xcite , @xmath135 oph ( 9% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and mon  r2 ( 25% ; * ? ? ?",
    "as noted by rl08 , the xc ( @xmath3pl  4 ) cluster lies at the high end of sfes ; this may indicate that on - going star formation has significantly depleted gas in the region .",
    "infrared observations have established that @xmath136% of stars in gmcs form in embedded clusters @xcite .",
    "unclustered pms stars have been established mainly in the orion molecular cloud complex , but even there it has been difficult to quantify their population and star formation processes @xcite .",
    "@xcite present new survey results from _",
    "maps of nearby star forming clouds , and many show a significant distributed population . distributed star formation in more distant clouds like the rmc is largely unstudied due to the heavy contamination from galactic field stars outside of dense clusters .",
    "modern astrophysical models of star formation in gmcs suggests that individual stars may commonly form asynchronously in supersonically turbulent cloud clumps @xcite .",
    "because our x - ray identified young stellar population suffers little contamination , we are able to examine the fraction of stars that are formed both in clusters and at low stellar densities in the rmc .",
    "the total number of sources in the three fields is 553 , of which 303 lie within the contours we use to define clusters xa , xb , and xc ( table  [ tbl : cls_counts ] ) . among the 250 stars distributed outside the clusters , at most 10% of the total detections",
    "could be galactic and extragalactic contaminants given the short exposure time and the presence of the molecular cloud (   [ sec : counterpart.sec ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath335% of stars could be formed in a distributed fashion throughout the rmc region , consistent with estimates from infrared studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . after correcting the sensitivity variation across the fields (   [ sec : new_sensitivity ] )",
    ", the fraction of distributed stars is @xmath345% , which implies that clustered star formation would then be the governing mechanism in the rmc but distributed star formation is rather important .",
    "however , further interpretation of this fraction should proceed with caution .",
    "there are at least three sources of complexity here .",
    "first , our definition of cluster boundaries based on smoothed stellar density maps ( figure  [ fig : ch5_ssd ] ) is arbitrary , which are about 0.8 stars arcmin@xmath137 for the x - ray - sampled stellar density . in comparison , in refl08",
    "the cluster boundaries are defined by 0.2 stars arcmin@xmath137 contour levels in the nearest neighbor density map of ir - excess sources .",
    "they find that 60% stars in the complex are in clusters .",
    "the clustering fraction reaches 86% if only the stars within the molecular cloud are considered . besides the differences in the field coverage of the x - ray and ir surveys",
    "( see also   [ sec : discuss_xir ] ) , we could get different distributed fractions with different , reasonable choices of cluster boundaries .    second , a significant number of lower mass pms stars ( @xmath138  m@xmath45 ) is missing from our survey due to short x - ray exposures (   [ sec : sensitivity ] ) . while there may be no preference for lower - mass stars to be clustered or distributed ,",
    "it is possible that higher - mass stars preferentially form in denser clusters from primordial mass segregation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "third , the distributed stars may have been born in a clustered environment but have moved into a wider region .",
    "numerical simulations show that the formation process of a cluster of stars is highly dynamic and chaotic ; stellar encounters violently eject some of the young stars from multiple systems @xcite .",
    "sparse clusters in particular can lose @xmath139 of their stars over a few myrs . thus the observed distributed populations may not have formed _ in situ_.",
    "an underlying theme to this and similar studies concerns the relationships between x - ray and infrared surveys of star forming molecular clouds to uncover young stellar populations .",
    "each as advantages and disadvantages . with instruments like flamingos",
    ", nir surveys can cover large cloud areas to faint magnitudes .",
    "these catalogs can include virtually the entire cloud population at low to moderate extinctions ( @xmath140 ) , but often suffer bad ( often factors @xmath141 ) contamination by foreground and background field stars .",
    "used by themselves , pms samples are restricted to stars with nir - bright inner disks , usually class  ii and lightly obscured class  i systems .",
    "the resulting nir - excess samples can constitute only a small fraction ( @xmath142% ) of the total stellar populations which are often dominated by systems with cool or absent disks . with space - based instruments like @xmath7 s irac",
    ", mir surveys also cover large cloud areas with very high sensitivity and penetration to @xmath64 . as with nir studies ,",
    "mir observations are dominated by field star populations and samples are restricted to mir - excess systems .",
    "the nir - excess stars are recovered and new subpopulations emerge : embedded class  i and some class  0 systems , low luminosity pms brown dwarf systems , and a few older systems with transitional mir - excess disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "diskfree class  iii members are catalogued but can not be distinguished from contaminants .",
    "x - ray surveys have very different characteristics because they trace magnetic reconnection flaring rather than stellar and disk bolometric emission",
    ". older galactic field stars with much lower flaring levels are nearly absent , and most extragalactic contaminants are readily removed by the absence of stellar counterparts .",
    "x - rays can penetrate @xmath143 but with reduced sensitivity .",
    "x - ray studies also give estimates of the total stellar populations , and measurements of absorption for each star individually .",
    "while some class  i and ii systems are recovered , the main advantage of x - ray observations is that disk - free class  iii pms members are readily detected , subject to the sensitivity limitations which correlate with stellar mass .",
    "since many clusters are dominated by class  iii stars , the x - ray populations can considerably exceed the nir- or mir - excess populations .",
    "a significant drawback is areal coverage : the @xmath144 telescope has a @xmath43 field but suffers confusion in crowded fields , while the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ has a 17 field of view with subarcsecond resolution .",
    "this limitation can be somewhat mitigated with mosaics as described here .",
    "the combination of x - ray and infrared studies are more effective at uncovering pms populations in molecular clouds than any one method .",
    "we find here that the x - ray samples are quite free from contamination and can be 10 times richer than the nir- or mir - excess samples ( table  [ tbl : cls_counts ] ) .",
    "this greatly assists in tracing the spatial structure of star formation in the cloud .",
    "subsequent infrared photometry then gives the evolutionary classification , absorption and approximate mass of each x - ray - selected star without bias towards luminous disks ( figures  [ fig : ch5_ccd]-[fig : ch5_cmd ] ) .",
    "there is good agreement between our x - ray survey and refl08 nir survey ( and other surveys ) . taking this combined x - ray / infrared approach ,",
    "we emerge with a number of results on the pms population in the portion of the rmc examined with @xmath10 .",
    "first , we confirm past findings that star formation is not spatially uniform in the cloud , and we estimate that about 1/3 of the stars lie in unclustered environments (   [ sec : distribsf ] ) .",
    "this supports a large body of infrared - based survey work giving similar results in other clouds @xcite .",
    "second , we estimate the total population in the examined portion of the cloud to be about 1700 stars down to the substellar limit ( table  [ tbl : cls_counts ] ) . this estimate is based on an extrapolation of the empirical pms @xmath41-mass correlation @xcite and knowledge of our x - ray sensitivity limits (   [ sec : sensitivity ] ) .",
    "this is similar to the total population of @xmath145 stars found for the central ngc  2244 cluster which illuminates the rosette nebula hii region ( paper i ) .",
    "third , in contrast to the single concentrated ob cluster at the center of the rosette nebula , the rmc population is divided into three smaller clusters which themselves can be divided into sparse subclusters .",
    "portions of x - ray clusters xb and xc are associated with well - established infrared clusters pl  2 and pl  4 (   [ sec : xbxc ] ) .",
    "the x - ray stellar distributions and absorptions provide more detail on these structures .",
    "xc is richest with a total population around 800 stars ; subcluster xc2 is more deeply embedded with younger stars than xc1 . similarly in cluster xb , group xb2 has more protostars than xb1 .",
    "these structures are thus inhomogeneous and not coeval .",
    "we caution that , our current identifications of structural components are from figure  [ fig : ch5_ssd ] ( and figure  [ fig : chandra_contour ] ) rather than figure  [ fig : uniform_contour ] , as the addition of more sources is critically needed for substructure identification . while some substructures were cross - identified in the infrared ( see table  [ tbl : cls_comparison ] ) , the weak substructures certainly require further confirmation regarding the details of their locations and sizes .",
    "subcluster xb2 = pl  2 is sparse but contains the highest - mass star in our examined region of the rmc , the heavily obscured , infrared - excess o9/b0 star rmcx  # 89 = iras 06306 + 0437 (   [ sec : rmcx89 ] ) .",
    "there is only one lower - mass protostar , rmcx  # 72 , lies at a projected distance of 0.3  pc to rmcx  # 89 .",
    "the absence of a substantial cluster surrounding this massive protostar has interesting implications for star formation at the edge of hii regions where triggering may be active .",
    "the system can not realistically be dynamically ejected from a more crowded region , as it is still embedded in its dense dusty envelope .",
    "one possibility is that the massive star formed in isolation .",
    "we recall that hd  46223 , one of the two o4 stars in the unobscured ngc  2244 cluster lies in a puzzling location near the southeast boundary of the nebula and , based on our @xmath10 study , has no lower mass companions ( paper i ) . iras 06306 + 0437",
    "may be like hd  46223 seen at an earlier phase .",
    "another possibility is that the massive star has formed before ( except for rmcx  # 72 ) an accompanying cluster of lower mass stars .",
    "if this scenario applies , the star formation sequence is opposite to the one @xcite inferred for the embedded w3  main clusters , where the ob stars appeared to have formed after , not before , an extended cluster of lower - mass pms stars .",
    "while it is reasonable that the density of obscured x - ray sources decreases significantly towards the hii region ionized by the ngc 2244 cluster , it was surprising that the new lightly obscured cluster xa appeared in the x - ray survey in a region with no molecular material (   [ sec : xa ] ) .",
    "infrared surveys likely missed this structure due to the paucity of infrared - excess stars and confusion by the bright pah and atomic nebular emission , a stellar enhancement associated with xa can be discerned in 2mass , flamingos , and @xmath7 stellar distributions .",
    "its location and low fraction of ir - excess sources suggest that it may have formed through an early epoch of triggered star formation produced by the expanding rosette nebula hii region .",
    "it appears similar to the small ngc 2237 cluster on the western side of the rosette nebula ( * ? ? ?",
    "* refl08 ) .",
    "a detailed @xmath10 study of ngc  2237 is presented in paper iii .",
    "while paper iii will present a more comprehensive discussion of star formation in the rosette complex , some immediate inferences can be made concerning the rmc structures presented here .",
    "ngc  2244 is the youngest ob cluster among the sub - associations @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that sequential star formation extends into the rmc following the compression and triggering process described by @xcite .",
    "however , neither refl08 , @xcite nor the present study support this model in the xb and xc region of the rmc . no clear spatial sequence of stellar ages is seen .",
    "it is plausible , however , that cluster xa was triggered by the expanding rosette hii region . at present",
    "it lies in ( or , at least , projected upon ) the ionized region rather than in the molecular cloud .",
    "it has the smallest fraction of infrared - excess stars of the clusters examined here , and hence was likely the earliest formed .",

    "we thank travis rector and mark heyer for kindly providing the kpno mosaic images of the rosette nebula and the co emission maps of the rosette complex , respectively .",
