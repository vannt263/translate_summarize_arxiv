    "the exchange of two  gluons is the simplest realization of the pomeron in terms of the qcd degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown that the two  gluon exchange model can account for experimental data for the differential cross section of @xmath1 and @xmath2 photoproduction up to a momentum transfer of @xmath3 gev@xmath4 and @xmath5 gev@xmath4 respectively @xcite , which is the largest momentum range available so far .",
    "one of the essential issues in getting such a good agreement was the role of quark correlations , i.e. , diagrams where each gluon couples to a different quark in the proton .",
    "as new data will become available from jlab for a wider range of @xmath0 it is important to study the predictions of the two  gluon exchange model in that region . in particular ,",
    "our goal is to test the stability of these predictions against changes in the inputs of the model .",
    "we will focus on the study of the treatment of quark correlations in the proton and on the choice of the ( non  perturbative ) gluon propagator .",
    "it was argued that contributions from the diagram of figure 1b , not included in the pomeron picture , are negligible as compared to the ones where both gluons couple to the same quark @xcite , figure 1a .",
    "while this is true at low @xmath0 , as @xmath0 increases both contributions become comparable and eventually the one of figure 1b dominates @xcite .    at high energies the dirac structure of the two  gluon coupling in figure 1a",
    "is simply vector  like .",
    "its contribution is proportional to the isoscalar dirac form factor of the nucleon @xmath6 , which is usually taken from fits to the experimental data .",
    "the diagram of figure 1b is governed by a two  quark correlation function which , in the eikonal approximation @xcite , can be written as :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the ( transverse ) momenta flowing through each gluon ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 is the nucleon wave function which depend on the longitudinal momentum @xmath12 and the coordinates @xmath13 in the transverse space .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath14 requires the explicit knowledge of the nucleon wave function .",
    "nonetheless , this requirement is usually circumvented by making the approximation @xcite :    @xmath15    however , the expression above is strictly valid only when @xmath16 . a more accurate approach that accounts for",
    "the smearing in the longitudinal momentum of the quarks obviously involves the explicit calculation of @xmath14 with a definite choice for the nucleon wave function .",
    "we have taken a simplified version of the wave function proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and extensively used to evaluate ( soft ) contributions to a number of observables @xcite . in momentum space it can be written as :    @xmath17 \\label{wavefunction}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is a normalization constant , @xmath19 is the asymptotic distribution amplitude for the nucleon and @xmath20 refers to transverse momentum .",
    "we have fitted the free parameter @xmath21 to get a reasonable description of the isoscalar dirac form factor of the nucleon .",
    "we get @xmath22 gev@xmath23 , which gives and averaged transverse momentum @xmath24 gev .",
    "another important component in the two  gluon exchange model is the choice of the gluon propagator . in order to get an infrared safe behavior one has to deal with dressed propagators which are finite at the origin . from the physical viewpoint",
    "this prevents the gluon from propagating over very large distances . in order to match the successful description of cross sections provided by the pomeron the two ",
    "gluon exchange @xmath25 amplitude is normalized at @xmath26 to the pomeron exchange amplitude , i.e.    @xmath27 ^ 2 = \\frac{9}{4 \\pi } \\beta_0 ^ 2 \\ ; , \\label{normalization}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 gev@xmath23 is the pomeron ",
    "quark coupling constant and @xmath29 is an effective ( frozen ) value for the strong coupling constant which takes into account that we also deal with the non  perturbative domain .",
    "it is customary to choose a gaussian form for the gluon propagator :    @xmath30\\ ; , \\label{gaussian}\\ ] ]    where the parameter @xmath31 gev@xmath4 is fixed to reproduce the total cross section for @xmath1 electroproduction @xcite .",
    "a gaussian propagator provides a reasonable agreement with a wide variety of experimental data @xcite .",
    "however , it poses a conceptual problem since it does not have the right asymptotic behavior",
    ". a perturbative tail could be added by hand to eq .",
    "( [ gaussian ] ) , but it can be shown that the ( gaussian ) non  perturbative part dominates the contribution to the differential cross section even at large @xmath0 .",
    "an alternative path is to allow the gluon to have an effective mass which renders the perturbative propagator finite at the origin and has the right asymptotic behavior , provided that this mass vanishes at large momentum .",
    "cornwall @xcite derived an expression for a massive gluon propagator :    @xmath32 \\log{[\\frac{l^2 + 4 m^2 ( l^2)}{\\lambda^2 } ] } } \\label{cornwall}\\ ] ]    with a dynamically generated mass @xmath33 which has a logarithmic fall  off with the momentum .",
    "in order to set a common ground to compare with other approaches we have imposed the normalization condition ( [ normalization ] ) on this propagator and then we find @xmath34 mev for @xmath35 mev .",
    "this value for @xmath36 is within the range of the estimates of cornwall ( @xmath37 mev ) @xcite .",
    "photoproduction in the two  gluon exchange model ( see text for explanation ) . ]    ' '' ''",
    "in figure 2 we summarize our results for the differential cross section for @xmath2 photoproduction .",
    "the solid line represents the calculation with a gaussian propagator and the assumption ( [ approximation ] ) for the two  quark correlation function .",
    "results in ref .",
    "@xcite where obtained under these assumptions .",
    "if we explicitly calculate the function @xmath14 with the wave function ( [ wavefunction ] ) then we get the results represented by the dashed line in figure 2 . by comparing the two curves we can see that the specific way in which two  quark correlations are calculated has some effects only at large momentum transfer : at low and moderate @xmath0 it is the diagram of figure 1a , i.e. the isoscalar dirac form factor , that dominates . dashed ",
    "dotted line is obtained with @xmath14 evaluated with the nucleon wave function and the massive propagator for the gluon , eq .",
    "( [ cornwall ] ) . by comparing with the dashed line",
    "it is clear that the use of a massive propagator instead of the gaussian one produces a further depletion in the differential cross section at large @xmath0 .",
    "it also decreases slightly the slope at small @xmath0 .    the same pattern of differences shown in figure 2 is obtained for @xmath1 production .",
    "however , in that case , those differences are softened by quark ",
    "exchange contributions , which have to be incorporated before comparing with data @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile emphasizing that preliminary data from the clas collaboration at jlab for @xmath2 photoproduction at @xmath38 gev supports the depletion obtained with the massive gluon propagator and the explicit calculation of @xmath14 ( dashed  dotted line in figure 2 ) .",
    "moreover , the use of a massive propagator is also essential in getting a definite asymptotic behavior for @xmath39 at attainable values of @xmath0 .",
    "we will address these issues in more detail in @xcite .",
