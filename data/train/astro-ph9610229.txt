    "age estimates for globular clusters indicate that they formed early in the history of the milky way and represent ` fossil relics ' of the proto - galaxy ( larson 1990 ) . attempting to uncover this history",
    ", researchers have carefully examined a range of properties of the present - day cluster system , paying particular attention to the cluster kinematic distribution ( e.g. zinn 1993 ) , mass distribution ( e.g. harris & pudritz 1994 ) , metallicity distribution ( e.g. zinn 1985 ) and age distribution ( e.g. chaboyer , demarque & sarajedini 1996 ) .",
    "these investigations have provided evidence for both accreted and native components in the cluster system ( searle & zinn 1978 ) and correlations between kinematics and metallicity which may trace the collapse of the galaxy ( zinn 1985 ; armandroff 1989 ; zinn 1993 ) .",
    "comparisons with other stellar populations have revealed subtleties in the process of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "for example , in the inner galaxy , the globular cluster distribution is flatter than the distribution of halo field stars although their profiles match well at larger radii .",
    "in addition , the field star velocity ellipsoid has a strong a radial bias in comparison to the approximately isotropic cluster velocity ellipsoid ( e.g. ostriker , binney & saha 1989 ) .",
    "conversely , zinn ( 1985 ) and armandroff ( 1989 ) have presented convincing evidence for a high - metallicity disk cluster population which has broad similarities in kinematics , spatial distribution and metallicity with the stellar thick disk .",
    "understanding the origin of these relationships will improve our picture of the primordial milky way .    at the same time",
    ", theoretical interest in globular cluster evolution has been motivated by the discovery that two - body relaxation would drive evolution on a time scale that is much less than the age of a typical cluster ( ambartsumian 1938 ; spitzer 1940 ; chandrasekhar 1942 ) .",
    "subsequent research provided an understanding of the gravothermal instability ( lynden - bell & wood 1968 ) and the phenomenon of core collapse ( e.g. cohn 1980 ) .",
    "one of the basic conclusions of this work on cluster evolution is that relaxation inevitably leads to evaporation ( e.g. spitzer 1987 ) .",
    "additional refinements to the picture of relaxation - driven evolution have been required to account for a source of energy which halts core collapse ( e.g. henon 1961 ; lee & ostriker 1987 ) and to include tidal influences which arise on a cluster s orbit in a parent galaxy ( ostriker , spitzer & chevalier 1972 ; chernoff , kochanek & shapiro 1986 ; weinberg 1994 ; gnedin & ostriker 1996 ; murali & weinberg 1996 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "recent work on tidal influences has shown that evaporation is accelerated by the interaction of a cluster with the tidal field produced by the halo and disk of the galaxy ( gnedin & ostriker 1996 ; paper i ) .",
    "these studies show that depletion depends strongly on cluster mass and orbit in the galaxy .",
    "this suggests that understanding the initial characteristics of clusters and their relationship to other stellar populations in the galaxy requires a comprehensive description of evolution since the time of formation . in a related study which supports this view , murali & weinberg ( 1996 ; hereafter paper ii ) , have demonstrated the importance of evolution in shaping the m87 globular cluster population and as a partial cause for the specific frequency conundrum in fundamental plane ellipticals .    motivated by these results in the present work",
    ", we investigate the degree to which evolution has shaped the milky way cluster population .",
    "our approach is to predict the initial spatial and kinematic distributions of the globular cluster system using the fokker - planck description of cluster evolution discussed in paper i in combination with the parametric statistical framework employed in paper ii .",
    "the predictions describe the initial population of clusters which evolve quasi - statically through relaxation and tidal heating and indicate changes which dynamical evolution has wrought on the system as a whole .",
    "the results also provide a basis for understanding the primordial relationship of globular clusters to other stellar populations .",
    "we first study the evolutionary behavior of clusters which inhabit the disk and halo of the galaxy .",
    "the calculations demonstrate the importance of disk heating on cluster evolution and quantify dependences on important internal and external parameters , including orbit in the galaxy and cluster concentration .",
    "we also examine the behavior of internal density profiles and mass spectra in evolving clusters .    having considered the detailed physical behavior , we examine properties of the full cluster population . we first characterize properties of the current cluster population and then predict its initial conditions using the data set compiled by gnedin & ostriker ( 1996 ) and the three - space velocities derived by cudworth ( 1993 ) .",
    "the inferences are derived from both spherical and two - component disk+sphere models of the cluster distribution .",
    "while several analyses have shown the cluster system to be approximately spherically distributed ( chernoff & djorgovski 1989 ; thomas 1989 ) , other investigations show two components : a flattened , rapidly rotating high - metallicity component associated with the galactic disk and a spherically distributed low - metallicity component associated with the galactic halo ( zinn 1985 ; armandroff 1989 ) .",
    "further subdivisions may also exist ( zinn 1993 ; zinn 1996 ) .",
    "the choice of models reflects the gross characteristics of the cluster system and allows us to compare the candidate distributions .",
    "the results predict significant differences in the initial and present - day cluster populations , indicating the role of evolution in shaping the present - day cluster system .",
    "moreover , neither model is completely successful in describing the cluster population probably due to the combined effects of evolution and obscuration .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : investigation ] , we summarize the approach and scenario used throughout the investigation . the results are presented in  [ sec : results ] and include description of the physical behavior as a function of orbit , examination of the internal properties of evolving clusters and analysis and prediction of the initial conditions of the observed population .",
    "finally ,  [ sec : discussion ] discusses the implications of the results .",
    "the appendices provide derivations of the models and a discussion of the statistical procedure .",
    "our fiducial population consists of clusters which formed in a single episode approximately @xmath1 ago , the lower limit on cluster ages estimated from current models of stellar evolution ( chaboyer 1995 ) . for older ages , the evolution in the properties of the cluster system is greater than the estimates derived below .",
    "initial clusters are assigned @xmath2 king model profiles .",
    "investigation of concentration dependence in  [ sec : concentration ] shows that evaporation times vary little with @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that each cluster has a salpeter imf @xmath4 with @xmath5 and lower mass limit @xmath6 . for this choice",
    ", stellar evolution would dominate for the first , roughly corresponding to the main sequence lifetime of a @xmath7 a - star , which we choose as the upper mass limit , @xmath8 . following",
    "the phase of strong stellar evolution , relaxation , external heating and , ultimately , core collapse heating would begin to drive cluster evolution .",
    "we define our zero - population at this epoch , approximately @xmath9 in the past .    in light of observational evidence ,",
    "we adopt a two - component model of the cluster population consisting of flattened and spherical distributions .",
    "we employ the commonly used terminology of ` disk ' and ` halo ' cluster to refer to members of these sub - populations .",
    "a ` disk ' cluster is most often ` metal - rich ' with disk kinematics while a ` halo ' cluster is most often ` metal - poor ' with halo kinematics but which may have high or low orbital inclination relative to the disk .",
    "a ` classic ' halo orbit , however , is one of high inclination from the disk .      following formation and early stellar evolution ,",
    "cluster evolution is driven by relaxation , the tidal field and binary heating of the core .",
    "as described in papers i & ii , the competition between relaxation and the tidal field of a galaxian spheroid is particularly important in determining a cluster s evolutionary time scale and survival history .",
    "the dominant effects of the spheroid on tidally - limited clusters were found to be heating on low - eccentricity orbits and tidal truncation on high - eccentricity orbits .    in the milky way",
    ", the disk also contributes significantly to cluster evolution . for high inclination orbits",
    ", a number of investigations have shown that the compressional shock imparted to a cluster during its passage through the disk will generally enhance the evaporation rate ( spitzer & chevalier 1972 ; chernoff , kochanek & shapiro 1986 ; weinberg 1994 ; gnedin & ostriker 1996 ) . for orbits confined to the disk , oscillations of the cluster about the midplane transfer energy through resonant stellar orbits .",
    "below we examine the effect of the disk on cluster evolution on both low- and high - inclination orbits (  [ sec : behavior ] ) .",
    "appendix [ sec : disk ] outlines the derivation of the heating rate for disk oscillations .      for eccentric , high - inclination orbits , the orbital phase of disk passage varies due to the precession of the argument of perihelion with respect to the plane of the galaxy because orbits are not closed in the logarithmic potential . to remove dependence on orbital phase , we assume that disk shocking occurs twice per orbital period at the average orbital radius of the cluster . for eccentric low - inclination orbits ,",
    "we follow the same procedure and also assume that the vertical motion is separable from the radial and tangential motion in all orbits .",
    "this allows us to define approximate three - integral distribution functions ( dfs ) in terms of algebraic constants of the motion (  [ sec : distributions ] ) . with these dfs",
    ", we can follow the evolution of the phase space distribution of globular clusters using a series of fokker - planck calculations (  [ sec : calculations ] )    orbits in the spheroid are defined using the quantity @xmath10 , the angular momentum relative to maximum for an orbit of energy e. the inclination angle , @xmath11 , is defined with respect to the disk so that @xmath12 defines an orbit in the plane of the disk .",
    "oscillations through the disk are defined by their oscillation height in multiples of the disk scale height , @xmath13 .",
    "clusters on orbits highly inclined from the disk are tidally limited by the galactic spheroid . while initial cluster densities may differ from the mean density required by perigalactic tidal limitation , subsequent evolution during the first gigayear leads rapidly to tidal truncation or disruption .",
    "clusters on orbits confined to the disk may posess limiting radii , @xmath14 , smaller than that implied by tidal limitation in the spheroid ( e.g. note the discrepancy between the observed and predicted tidal radius of m71 : drukier , fahlman & richer 1993 ) .",
    "this implies that their density is higher than that required for tidal limitation at given concentration . however , ",
    "[ sec : density ] shows that evaporation times vary little with density for fixed mass .",
    "therefore , in studying population evolution , we assume that low - inclination clusters are also tidally limited .",
    "the limiting radius @xmath14 is determined by the cluster mass , orbit and the ratio of cluster mean density to the mean density required for tidal limitation ( see  [ sec : disk_parms ] and paper i for further details ) .",
    "when clusters are tidally limited , we refer to the limiting radius as the _ tidal radius _ , @xmath15 .",
    "we use parametric models to define distributions of cluster orbits and masses in both disk and spheroid populations .",
    "mass distributions , @xmath16 , are defined using either a power law ( harris & pudritz 1994 ) , a two - component power law or a gaussian magnitude distribution ( mclaughlin , harris & hanes 1994 ) .",
    "the two - component power - law mass spectrum is continuous at the break at mass @xmath17 .",
    "distributions of cluster orbits are defined using well - known models ( table [ tab : models ] ) which are generalized to provide kinematic and spatial distributions for populations in the galactic potential (  [ sec : mw_model ] ) .",
    "disk component dfs are defined as functions of @xmath18 , the orbital energy associated with motion in the disk plane , @xmath19 , the square of the z - component of the angular momentum and @xmath20 , the orbital energy associated with motion perpendicular to the disk plane .",
    "the functional form is obtained using the mestel disk with no net rotation ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) combined with an isothermal vertical distribution .",
    "this provides a family of constant anisotropy , power - law surface density profiles with power - law index @xmath21 of infinite range .",
    "the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively define the velocity dispersion , @xmath24 , in terms of the ( constant ) circular rotation velocity , @xmath25 , and degree of anisotropy of the distribution in the disk plane .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 defines the vertical scale height of the distribution in terms of the vertical velocity dispersion , @xmath27 , and the central potential of the disk , @xmath28 .",
    "appendix [ sec : mestel_disk ] discusses the model family in further detail .",
    "spheroidal component distribution functions are defined as functions of @xmath29 , the total energy of the orbital motion , and @xmath30 , the square of the total angular momentum .",
    "we use two models . the first is obtained by adapting the mestel df to the spherical case which we refer to as the _",
    "mestel sphere_. the second is the eddington model ( aguilar , hut & ostriker 1988 ) .",
    "the mestel sphere provides a family of constant anisotropy power - law space density profiles with power - law index @xmath31 of infinite range .",
    "the quantities @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively define the velocity dispersion , @xmath34 , in terms of the ( constant ) circular rotation velocity , @xmath25 , and degree of anisotropy of the distribution as in the disk case .",
    "the eddington sphere produces a family of variable anisotropy , power - law space density profiles with core radius @xmath35 and power - law index @xmath36 at large radii .",
    "radial anisotropy becomes significant beyond the core radius .",
    "appendices [ sec : mestel_sphere ] and [ sec : eddington_sphere ] provide derivations and further discussion of these models .    complete orbit and mass distributions are given by joint distributions @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes constants which define a disk or halo orbit .",

    "since the cluster population is not large , we therefore determine the parameter @xmath40 for the observed distribution , and keep it fixed when estimating the initial conditions in order to minimize the number of parameters . for the disk distribution , we impose cutoffs in radius at @xmath41 ( wainscoat et al .",

    "our models can include 7 parameters for each cluster ( mass , 3 spatial coordinates and 3 velocity coordinates ) . however , not all quantities are available in most cases .",
    "to incorporate all available data , we use a likelihood technique for incomplete data sets ( little & rubin 1987 ; stuart & ord 1991 ) .",
    "the likelihood is constructed in the usual manner as the joint probability of all observations given the model . however , for clusters with unavailable phase space quantities , the probability is obtained by integrating the distribution function over all dimensions of unknown information .",
    "this defines the marginal probability of observing a particular cluster given the model .",
    "typically , only the heliocentric radial velocity is known , so we integrate over the tangential velocities relative to our vantage point to derive the marginal probability of observing a cluster at a given position with a given heliocentric radial velocity .",

    ", we also include the three - space velocities which now exist for about 20 clusters ( cudworth 1993 ) .",
    "this is referred to as the _ augmented data set_.      we follow the evolution of individual clusters using the one - dimensional fokker - planck approximation ( cohn 1979 ) .",
    "the calculations include relaxation , external heating due to the time - varying tidal field of the disk and spheroid , and a phenomenological binary heating term ( lee et al .",
    "spheroidal tidal heating is included using the implementation discussed in paper i. disk tidal heating is implemented as a shock on high - inclination orbits and as an average heating rate on low - inclination , oscillatory orbits .",
    "the numerical procedure used on low - inclination orbits is the same used for orbits in the spheroid . on high - inclination orbits , we use an analogous , flux - conserving scheme to compute the total change in the df due to the passage through the disk .",
    "properties of the evolved cluster population are estimated from a grid of fokker - planck calculations performed over a range of cluster orbits .",
    "for the disk clusters , we use a @xmath67 grid in apogalactic radius , mass and @xmath68 to sample the phase space .",
    "apogalactica are taken in the range @xmath69 , masses in the range @xmath70 and orbits in the range @xmath71 . for the halo clusters , we use a @xmath72 grid with @xmath73 and the same range of mass and @xmath68 .",
    "all clusters with @xmath74 are assumed depleted and all clusters with energies equal to a circular orbit with @xmath75 are assumed to be unevolved . for @xmath76 , clusters on circular orbits either evaporate or decay into the nucleus by dynamical friction ( aguilar , hut & ostriker 1988 ) and clusters on eccentric orbits evaporate . for @xmath77 ,",
    "the evaporation timescale on a circular orbit is @xmath78 for @xmath79 and is roughly the same for other orbits of equal energy . in most cases",
    "observed clusters with @xmath80 initially had masses above @xmath79 . in a few cases , extrapolation beyond the initially defined grid",
    "is required .",
    "in  [ sec : behavior ] , we find that low inclination halo clusters evolve more rapidly than high inclination clusters , although the differences are not extreme",
    ". however , in order to reduce computational expense , we neglect low - inclination orbits in the spherical component and assume that all orbits have high inclination .",
    "this assumption circumvents the roughly factor - of - four increase in halo phase space grid size required to sample the cylindrical geometry . as a result ,",
    "the initially spherical distribution remains spherical and we underestimate the amount of evolution about the midplane of the disk .",
    "the consequences of this assumption are elaborated below .",
    "we represent the spherical component of the galaxy as a singular isothermal sphere with @xmath81 and the disk component as an exponential disk with radial scale length @xmath82 normalized to the disk central density in the solar neighborhood , @xmath83 ( bahcall 1984 ) .",
    "the vertical profile is taken to be gaussian with a scale height of @xmath84 .",
    "the gaussian was adopted instead of an exponential initially due to concern about the analyticity of the perturbation and its effect on adiabatic invariance .",
    "however , comparisons between the two profiles show no strong differences in heating rate ( weinberg 1994 ) .",
    "the solar radius is taken to be @xmath85 .",
    "all measured radial velocities are converted to velocities in the galactic rest frame using an lsr velocity of @xmath86 and a solar motion of @xmath87 ( mihalas & binney 1981 ) .      in order to parameterize the strength of the spheroid relative to the cluster in paper",
    "i , we introduced the quantity @xmath88 which denotes the fraction of the cluster mass contained within the pericentric inner lagrange point . here , because of the the disk , it is convenient to define the following two ratios : @xmath89 denotes the ratio of the pericentric inner lagrange point to the limiting radius of the cluster ; and @xmath90 denotes the ratio of the disk central density at a given radius @xmath91 to the cluster mean density .",
    "this latter parameter defines the tidal amplitude of the disk relative to the cluster in the same way that @xmath88 is used to define the relative tidal amplitude of the spheroid . using @xmath92",
    ", we can relate the cluster mean density , @xmath93 , to the mean density required for tidal limitation in the spheroid , @xmath94 , by @xmath95 .",
    "in paper i , the evolution of a cluster of fixed mass , @xmath88 and @xmath68 could be scaled to an orbit of any energy due to the scale - free nature of the tidal field .",
    "this allowed us to compare the orbital dependence of cluster evolution in several ways using the same calculations ( c.f .",
    "paper i ,  3.1 ) . adding the disk destroys this scaling freedom because the quantity @xmath96 varies with the radius of disk crossing @xmath43 . in order to compare cluster evolution on different orbits ,",
    "we show the mass remaining after @xmath97 in tidally limited clusters on orbits of equal apocenter over a range of mass and eccentricity both with and without the disk ( tables [ tab : disk_mass_rem ] and [ tab : halo_mass_rem ] ) .    for equal apocenter and fixed mass",
    ", the densities of tidally limited clusters increase with orbital eccentricity due to the decrease in @xmath15 with increasing perigalactic angular frequency .",
    "clusters on eccentric orbits therefore undergo the most rapid relaxation and have correspondingly large evaporation rates . as a result , for evolution in the spheroid alone , the remaining masses of @xmath79 clusters decrease monotonically with eccentricity .",
    "tidal heating also enhances mass loss rates on low - eccentricity orbits .",
    "the effect is noticeable in the remaining masses of more slowly relaxing @xmath98 clusters . at high eccentricity ,",
    "relaxation still predominates , but at low eccentricity , heating becomes important . as a result",
    "there is a peak in remaining mass at intermediate eccentricity .",
    "the large tidal amplitude of the disk relative to the spheroid greatly enhances heating on low- and intermediate eccentricity orbits in the disk+sphere calculations .",
    "high - mass low - eccentricity disk clusters lose equilibrium and disrupt .",
    "the low - mass counterparts do not disrupt but are rapidly driven to evaporation by strong tidal stripping .",
    "in addition , since the strength of the disk relative to the spheroid varies with radius , the importance of disk heating varies as a function of the radius of disk crossing .",
    "the relative strength of disk heating is highest at about @xmath99 . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath100 disk cluster at @xmath99 loses more mass than does its counterpart at @xmath101 ( table [ tab : disk_mass_rem ] ) .",
    "the tidal effect of the disk diminishes with increasing eccentricity because cluster densities increase relative to the disk density at the crossing point .",

    "our models overestimate the expected number of clusters . however , the ks confidence that the observed and model distribution differ is only 58% .    using the initial conditions from the two - component model , we derive the estimated initial distribution of clusters ( figure [ fig : ev_sd.1 ] ) .",
    "the total initial population has roughly 250 clusters , with 200 in the spheroid and 50 in the disk .",
    "approximately 43% of the initial population remains .",
    "before significant mass loss through stellar evolution , young clusters typically have strongly concentrated profiles ( e.g. elson , fall & freeman 1987 ) . during this phase , concentration is reduced as mass loss dominates gravothermal contraction , driving the expansion of individual clusters ( chernoff & weinberg 1990 ) . when stellar evolution mass loss subsides  and our model calculations begin  the resulting population will consist of clusters with a range of profiles .",
    "the calculations shown in  [ sec : concentration ] indicate , however , that evaporation times do not strongly depend on initial concentration .",
    "high concentration clusters undergo weaker tidal heating but maintain correspondingly larger rates of relaxation , so that evaporation times , for given mass , are approximately independent of concentration .",
    "the weak dependence of evaporation time on density is similar (  [ sec : density ] ) .",
    "the results of our calculations , therefore , do not depend significantly on the distribution of initial concentration .",
    "estimates of initial population size are derived assuming that an initially spherical cluster distribution remains spherical .",
    "however , clusters on orbits confined near the disk evolve more rapidly than those on high inclination orbits , leaving an axisymmetric distribution with minimum density about the midplane of the disk . estimates of initial halo cluster population size should not change significantly when accounting for additional cluster loss at low inclination because only @xmath133 more depletion of halo clusters is required to account for the remaining disk clusters .",
    "however , the observed disk cluster population is about 60% larger than our estimate of 16 . assuming that our estimate for the initial population size scales accordingly",
    ", we estimate that the disk population may have had roughly 80 members initially .",
    "the choice of the mass spectrum of clusters also influences estimates of initial population size .",
    "while use of a single power law is necessitated by sample size , the two - component power law clearly provides the best fit . to gauge the importance of this choice",
    ", we use the two - component fit and the results of paper ii as a guide .",
    "we estimate that the spectral index may decrease by @xmath134 for @xmath135 and by @xmath136 for @xmath137 since the high mass range is very similar to that considered in paper ii while more rapid evolution occurs in the low mass range .",
    "this implies initial spectral indices of @xmath138 and @xmath139 and 49% of the population with @xmath140 . in the single index fit with @xmath141 , 47% of the population",
    "has @xmath140 .",
    "since most of these clusters evaporate within a hubble time and since they dominate the depleted population , estimates of initial size will not change substantially when using a two - index model .",
    "both the spatial and kinematic distributions of halo globular clusters differ from those of halo field stars .",
    "harris ( 1976 ) and zinn ( 1985 ) found that the spatial distribution of the full cluster system goes as @xmath142 for @xmath143 , in good agreement with the profile of halo field stars ( freeman 1996 ) . at smaller radii",
    "the profile becomes shallower and flattens into a core ( ostriker , binney & saha 1989 ) .",
    "similarly , while the distribution of halo field star orbits appears to have significant radial bias ( beers & sommer - larsen 1995 ) , the distribution of halo cluster orbits appears to be nearly isotropic (  [ sec : orb_dyn ] ) .",
    "our results from the present - day fits also exhibit the discrepancy between the spatial distributions of halo clusters and halo field stars .",
    "the power - law profile derived using the mestel sphere appears considerably flatter than @xmath142 because we have included clusters with @xmath144 in the data set .",
    "the eddington sphere best represents the distribution over the full radial range .",
    "it has a core , density @xmath145 at small radius , a steep drop beyond @xmath146 with density @xmath147 and the expected power - law decline with density @xmath148 at intermediate radii .",
    "based on the estimates of initial conditions , we conclude that cluster evolution can account for the difference between the spatial distributions of halo clusters and field stars .",
    "the estimated initial density profile @xmath149 in both spherical and two - component models over the full radial range of the data .",
    "this is in good agreement with the halo field star profile @xmath150 recently determined by sommer - larsen & zhen ( 1990 ) as well as the conventionally accepted value of @xmath142 .",
    "evolution also accounts for at least some differences in halo cluster and field star kinematics . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : init ] , the predicted initial halo cluster population in the 2-component model has a strong radial bias which diminishes over time due to the preferential evaporation of clusters on eccentric orbits .",
    "approximately @xmath151 of the kinetic energy of this component is initially in radial motions .",
    "compared to @xmath152 implied by the isotropy of the observed halo cluster distribution , this is closer to the value of @xmath153 derived for halo field stars by beers & sommer - larsen ( 1995 ) and is roughly consistent with the value of @xmath154 derived by norris ( 1986 ) .",
    "the predicted initial disk population , by contrast , is unlike the observed stellar thick disk .",
    "the estimates indicate that the present - day high angular momentum population developed from a nearly isotropic initial distribution through the selective evaporation of clusters on eccentric orbits . although the model underestimates the size of the disk population , any resulting kinematic bias predicts higher angular momentum in the system because lower angular momentum members can not be distinguished from the halo clusters .",
    "evidence for a flattened component with nearly random kinematics may exist in the sample of halo clusters studied by zinn ( 1993 ) and in the halo field star sample studied by sommer - larsen & zhen ( 1990 ) .    overall , the results of this paper point to a scenario which correlates the origin of halo field stars and clusters during galaxy formation .",
    "the predicted disk cluster system is less clearly correlated with observed disk stellar populations but may be related to an intermediate phase of the dissipative collapse which is thought to have given rise to the disk ( larson 1990 ; zinn 1993 ) .",
    "the results do not contradict merger - induced heating of an initially cold disk ( quinn , hernquist & fullager 1993 ) , provided that initially circular disk cluster orbits can be isotropized by the accretion event .",
    "finally , we emphasize that our predictions describe the initial population of clusters which evolve quasi - statically through relaxation and tidal heating . since clusters probably formed with a range of initial densities , some would have been prey to rapid tidal disruption ( paper i ) .",
    "however , the significance of such initial conditions can not be divined from the observed population because , excepting a few clusters such as pal 5 ( cudworth 1993 ) , the majority of observed clusters must have formed with initial densities which allowed quasi - static evolution and long - term survival .",
    "consequently , the importance of tidal disruption in shaping the cluster population at an early epoch can be described only through models of the initial conditions of the cluster system in a proto - galactic or cosmological context ( paper i ) .",
    "the main conclusions of this work are as follows :    1 .",
    "the disk dominates tidal heating on low - eccentricity orbits .",
    "the effect of the spheroid is negligible except for @xmath155 .",
    "2 .   disk oscillations heat more efficiently than disk shocking due to better frequency matching in typical cluster potentials .",
    "cluster evolution depends weakly on initial concentration and density due to the combined effects of tidal heating and evaporation 4 .",
    "the evolution of disk clusters depends weakly on oscillation height .",
    "the loss of clusters on low - inclination orbits implies that the distribution of halo clusters is less dense near the disk .",
    "the evaporation of clusters on high - eccentricity orbits leads to increasing tangential bias in the distribution of cluster orbits .",
    "the estimated initial spatial distribution of halo clusters matches the present - day distribution of halo field stars .",
    "the estimated initial kinematic distribution is nearer to the observed radial anisotropy in the kinematics of halo field stars , having approximately 40% of its energy in radial motions .",
    "the estimated initial distribution of disk clusters does not match the kinematic distribution of the stellar disk .",
    "however , it is similar to the flattened halo samples studied by zinn ( 1993 ) and sommer - larsen & zhen ( 1990 ) .",
    "the outer profiles of evolving clusters deviate from the initial profiles in cases of moderate to strong tidal heating , leading to considerable evolution in the half - mass radius .",
    "profiles may also show density inflections which result from resonant clearing and which resemble the observed profiles of grillmair et al .",
    "( 1995,1996 ) . 10 .",
    "profiles of the mass spectral index become flatter in the core and steeper in the halo due to mass segregation .",
    "the profiles evolve similarly on all orbits and differ at fixed times only through orbitally determined differences in evolutionary timescale .",
