    "over the last few decades , it has become clear that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are ubiquitous at galaxy centers throughout the universe . stellar or gaseous motions at galactic centers indicate that almost every galaxy bulge in the local universe harbors a smbh ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "* ) , a key to understanding smbh growth and the origin of the @xmath5 relation may be found in observational properties of agns .",
    "one of the outstanding issues is the nature of their host galaxies ; in which galaxies do agns occur , and what impact do they have on the galaxies ?",
    "these questions have been addressed by numerous studies in recent years , especially in terms of negative feedback effects of agns on the star formation rates ( sfrs ) of the host galaxies .",
    "it has been suggested that the energy and/or momentum input of agns , which may be triggered along with starbursts by interactions / mergers of gas - rich galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , could suppress star formation by expelling the cold gas from galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the idea of negative agn feedback is also favored because it may provide a solution to longstanding problems with galaxy formation models ; for example , it is currently the most compelling process to reconcile the quite different shapes of the dark halo mass function predicted in the @xmath10cdm cosmology and the observed galaxy stellar mass function at the high mass end ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "different types of agns may play different roles in galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it has also been suggested that the host galaxies have a substantial contribution from intermediate - age stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may correspond to the late stage of accretion episode predicted in the above merger - driven evolutionary scenario .",
    "recent studies have taken advantage of a large sample of obscured agns , which show no visible sign of accretion - disk emission or broad lines at ultraviolet ( uv ) to optical wavelengths , discovered in large spectroscopic surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "overall , these studies have statistically confirmed the earlier findings and shown that obscured agns reside preferentially in massive galaxies . while there have been controversies over the host colors , recent work points out the importance of using a mass - matched control sample of inactive galaxies for unbiased measurements .",

    "the boss plates allow 1,000 fibers of 2  diameter to be observed simultaneously ; the fibers were allocated to the 849 quasars , 70 standard stars , a luminous red galaxy ( required by the boss targeting algorithm ) , and 80 sky positions .",
    "a typical epoch consists of eight to ten 15-minute exposures , totaling 65 hours when summed over the 32 epochs .",
    "the data were first processed through the boss spectroscopic pipeline ` idlspec2d v5_7_1 ` , which performs flat - fielding , 1d extraction , wavelength calibration , sky subtraction , and flux calibration ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the spectrum was resampled to a pixel scale of 69 km s@xmath18 , which corresponds to roughly a half of the resolution element .",

    "we devise a method to apply a series of spectral fits to the data in such a way that degeneracies between model components are minimized .",
    "the following models are used to represent the relevant emission components , namely , the quasar accretion disk , gas in the broad line region ( blr ) , narrow line region ( nlr ) , and interstellar medium ( ism ) , and stars in the host galaxy .",
    "1 .   accretion disk : the emission from the quasar accretion disk can be represented by a single power - law continuum ( @xmath38 ) in our spectral window , with the amplitude and slope being free parameters .",

    "it is modeled by subtracting the power - law contribution from the sdss quasar composite spectrum provided by @xcite .",
    "we take the composite of the highest - luminosity bin ( @xmath42 erg s@xmath18 ) so that the host contamination is minimized ; @xcite report that the contamination at @xmath43 5100   is negligible in a quasar with @xmath44 erg s@xmath18 .",
    "the power - law contribution is determined in two continuum windows ( in which strong emission lines are absent ) at @xmath32 = 4200  4230 and 5470  5500  .",
    "this pseudo - continuum template also includes individual blr , nlr , and ism lines present in the original composite spectrum , although the ism contribution should be minimal at this highest quasar luminosity .",
    "we consider seven additional narrow lines or line complexes , namely , [ ] @xmath323727 , [ ] @xmath323760 , [ ] @xmath323870 , @xmath45 h8 @xmath323890 , [ ] @xmath323969 , h@xmath46 , and h@xmath47 , to fit the ism lines .",

    "this template is velocity - broadened with a gaussian kernel with @xmath50 km s@xmath18 ; we test a different value of @xmath51 later .",
    "h@xmath36 is modeled with three gaussian emission profiles with variable amplitudes , widths , and velocity offsets , while the two [ ] lines are each modeled with two gaussians .",
    "the widths of these lines are varied independently from those of the above ism lines .",
    "we assume that the two [ ] lines have the theoretical intensity ratio @xmath325007/@xmath324959 = 3.0 and that the two lines share the same profile ( i.e. , widths and velocity offsets ) .",
    "stars : we use simple stellar population ( ssp ) models of @xcite to represent the stellar emission .",
    "ssp is a single generation of stars formed in an instantaneous starburst ; it is the simplest assumption for a stellar population and is suitable for the present analysis , in which the dominant quasar light makes it difficult to exploit full details of the stellar properties .",

    "we adopt the stelib @xcite stellar spectral library , the @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) , and solar metallicity .",
    "stellar age ( @xmath52 ) takes values from 30 myr to the age of the universe at the redshift of each object .",
    "the ssp spectra are velocity - broadened in accordance with the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath2 ) and the instrumental resolution assumed to be @xmath53 km s@xmath18 , and offset in wavelength by @xmath54 relative to the object s redshift ; both @xmath2 and @xmath54 are free parameters .",

    "we test different choices of stellar library , imf , and metallicity in  4 .",
    "our default models do not incorporate the effect of dust extinction .",
    "in fact , the amount of extinction observed in optically - selected broad - line quasars is usually quite small @xcite and its effect is limited .",
    "recently @xcite investigated a large sample of sdss broad - line quasars and found that the vast majority are consistent with @xmath55 mag . here",
    "we assume no dust extinction for both quasar nuclei and host galaxies , and later confirm that non - zero @xmath56 values have little impact on our qualitative conclusions .",
    "we note that there are dust - reddened broad - line quasars which can be identified in the near - infrared , although their surface density is much lower than that of optically - selected quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite presented an enhanced merger fraction in dust - reddened quasars , hence their host stellar properties may be quite different from those of normal optically - selected quasars .",
    "we perform a series of spectral fits rather than fitting all the model components simultaneously .",
    "first , we determine the stellar age @xmath52 by fitting the spectrum over the rest - frame wavelength range @xmath32 = 3700  4050    with the quasar power - law slope fixed to @xmath57 .",
    "this spectral window is chosen because ( i ) a wealth of strong stellar absorption features are present , including the ca hk lines and the 4000   break ; ( ii ) the quasar emission is relatively featureless ; ( iii ) the precise value of @xmath58 is not important , since the flux ratio between the two edges of the window ( @xmath59 ) changes only by @xmath3410 % when @xmath58 varies from @xmath60 to the extreme values of @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "second , the wider spectral range of @xmath633700  4750   and 5050  5400   ( i.e. , the full 3700  5400",
    "  spectral window excluding the h@xmath36 region ) is fit by varying all parameters but @xmath52 , which is fixed to the value determined above .",
    "we then return to the first step and update @xmath52 with the latest @xmath58 .",
    "these two steps are iterated until @xmath52 converges , but in most cases the convergence occurs with no more than two iterations .",
    "finally , we subtract the best - fit model from the full spectrum and fit the residual with the h@xmath36 and [ ] line models in the range @xmath32 = 4750  5050  .",
    "we apply the above algorithm to all the 191 sdss - rm quasars found at @xmath0 ; our spectral window ( @xmath32 = 3700  5400  ) is shifted beyond the spectrograph coverage at higher redshifts . the standard @xmath64 method is used for the model fitting with the idl routine mpfit @xcite .",
    "as described above , the pixel flux errors were taken from the boss spectroscopic pipeline and propagated appropriately through the co - addition process .",
    "figure [ fig : spec_decomp ] shows four typical examples of the decomposition results . while the spectra are usually dominated by quasar light , most of the small - scale features are fit by the stellar models .",
    "the median reduced @xmath64 of the fits over the whole spectral window is about five ; as seen in figure [ fig : spec_decomp ] , this rather large value is caused by the systematic discrepancy at certain wavelengths between the observed spectra and the models , the latter being not complex enough to provide perfect fits to every emission and absorption feature across the spectrum .",
    "the uncertainties in the best - fit parameters are estimated following the monte carlo method outlined in @xcite .",
    "we create 50 mock spectra by adding random noise to the original spectrum , using the gaussian probability density function ( pdf ) with the standard deviation equal to the flux error at each pixel , and process them through the decomposition algorithm .",
    "the measurement errors are evaluated from the 68 % central intervals of the parameter distributions of the 50 trials .",
    "we add additional 20 % error to the derived stellar age , which accounts for the minimum uncertainty arising from non - continuous coverage of ages in the ssp models .",

    "we exclude the 31 objects with @xmath66 from the following analysis ; we will demonstrate in the next section that their host results are unreliable .",

    "as shown in figure [ fig : spec_decomp ] , the [ ] line is comprised of two components , i.e. , the quasar blr / nlr template and the host ism line with gaussian profile .",
    "the former contribution is tied to the overall amplitude of the blr / nlr template , which is fit over the full spectral window .",

    "we correct the stellar mass , derived from the decomposed galaxy flux ( @xmath78 ) , for the aperture loss as follows . since the spectrophotometry of the boss spectroscopic pipeline is tied to the psf magnitude of standard stars , the quasar flux decomposed from each spectrum ( @xmath79 ) should correctly represent the total flux of the unresolved quasar nucleus .",

    "this conclusion was supported by @xcite with a larger sample at similar redshifts and with a careful assessment of selection biases .",
    "our results are consistent with these findings , but we have no estimate of disk contribution to @xmath1 and can not provide a direct support for the above scenario .",
    "the present @xmath6 relation is also similar to that of @xcite , who reported that the relation is offset toward large @xmath3 compared to the local relation at fixed @xmath1 .",
    "this result is likely due to the shallow slope of the relation , producing systematically large @xmath3/@xmath1 ratios at @xmath145 .",
    "the present spectral decomposition analysis is made possible due to the low - to - moderate luminosities of the quasars , with relative stellar contribution @xmath146 measured at @xmath147  , and the high snr of the spectra .",

    "figure [ fig : cakfssp ] presents the stellar fraction @xmath65 as a function of ew ( ca k ) , the rest - frame equivalent width of the ca k absorption line .",
    "ca k is one of the strongest stellar absorption features in a quasar spectrum at uv - to - optical wavelengths , while ca h is less visible due to the superposed [ ] @xmath323969 emission .",

    "<S> quasar host galaxies are key for understanding the relation between galaxies and the supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at their centers . </S>",
    "<S> we present a study of 191 broad - line quasars and their host galaxies at @xmath0 , using high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) spectra produced by the sloan digital sky survey reverberation mapping project . </S>",
    "<S> clear detection of stellar absorption lines allows a reliable decomposition of the observed spectra into nuclear and host components , using spectral models of quasar and stellar radiations as well as emission lines from the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate age , mass @xmath1 , and velocity dispersion @xmath2 of the host stars , the star formation rate ( sfr ) , quasar luminosity , and smbh mass @xmath3 , for each object . </S>",
    "<S> the quasars are preferentially hosted by massive galaxies with @xmath4 characterized by stellar ages around a billion years , which coincides with the transition phase of normal galaxies from the blue cloud to the red sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the host galaxies have relatively low sfrs and fall below the main sequence of star - forming galaxies at similar redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> these facts suggest that the hosts have experienced an episode of major star formation sometime in the past billion years , which was subsequently quenched or suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the derived @xmath5 and @xmath6 relations agree with our past measurements and are consistent with no evolution from the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> the present analysis demonstrates that reliable measurements of stellar properties of quasar host galaxies are possible with high - snr fiber spectra , which will be acquired in large numbers with future powerful instruments such as the subaru prime focus spectrograph . </S>"
