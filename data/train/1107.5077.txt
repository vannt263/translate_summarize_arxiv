    "cosmology has been a remarkably successful field in the last half century .",
    "@xcite due to our understanding of high energy particle physics embodied in the standard model of quarks and leptons we have considerable confidence in our understanding of the universe as far back as a microsecond or less and may even make reasonable theoretical speculations back to the inflation era at roughly @xmath0 s. @xcite for times before that we are free to speculate with varying degrees of plausibility ; there has been a great amount of such speculation , although it is often not clearly labeled as speculation .",
    "@xcite    one remarkable observational fact concerning the @xmath1cdm model is that the current universe is quite close to being flat ; that is @xmath2 to about a percent , which inflationary theorists ascribe to the large and rapid increase of the scale factor .",
    "@xcite our main result is a plausible alternative explanation for the flatness .",
    "our basic assumption in this note is that the scale factor of the universe at @xmath3 is described by the usual friedmann equation , which is dominated by a cosmological constant term and a curvature term .",
    "@xcite then the dynamics of the scale factor is approximately the same as that of the idealized tipping pencil shown in fig .",
    "1 , with an infinitely sharp point .",
    "the pencil thus serves as an amusing analog computer .",
    "a well - known homework problem in quantum mechanics is to calculate the the maximum time that such a pencil can be balanced before it tips over , subject to the uncertainty principle .",
    "@xcite the same calculation can be applied to the scale factor of the universe to see why it can not remain at zero and how rapidly it must increase . curiously it turns out that the analogy leads to a spatially flat universe .    in sec .",
    "2 we review the analysis of the tipping pencil , treated semi - classically but subject to the uncertainty principle . in section 3",
    "we analyze the evolution of the universe as an unstable system analogous to the pencil , with its evolution initiated by a quantum fluctuation according to the uncertainty principle , which leads to a spatially flat universe . within the context of cosmology and precise assumptions about the contents of the universe",
    "we therefore offer an answer to heidegger s famous question  why is there something rather than nothing.\"@xcite    almost needless to say our cosmogenesis scenario is quite speculative .",
    "we call it a scenario or toy model since it is not based on a compete theory , but it does give a plausible explanation of spatial flatness .",
    "we emphasize that the model is not a quantum cosmology but only uses a quantum fluctuation to get things started .",
    "we first consider the simplified pencil resting on its tip in fig.1 .",
    "it is easy to obtain its equation of motion for small angles , @xmath4 , @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the frequency the pencil would have if suspended by its tip as a pendulum , @xmath7 .",
    "a typical value is about @xmath8 .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) in terms of the initial angular position @xmath9 and angular velocity @xmath10 is @xmath11 classically the pencil could be balanced forever , @xmath12 , by choosing the initial conditions @xmath13 and @xmath14 , although of course this solution is unstable .    the initial conditions @xmath15 and @xmath14 are not consistent with the uncertainty principle .",
    "if we denote the mass by @xmath16 and the effective length by @xmath17 then the initial uncertainties in position and momentum for the top of the pencil are    @xmath18    so the uncertainty principle demands @xmath19 we obtain the maximum time one can balance the pencil , consistent with the uncertainty principle , by taking @xmath20 and minimizing @xmath21 with respect to @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath22 the tanh function rapidly approaches 1 for @xmath23 , so to maximize the time of fall we choose @xmath24 and thus obtain the initial values and solution to be    @xmath25=\\sqrt{\\hbar/(ml^2\\omega)}\\exp(\\omega{t})).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    of course this solution is only valid for @xmath4 .",
    "a first integral of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is @xmath26 and the constant of integration @xmath27 may be expressed in terms of the initial conditions as @xmath28 the effective potential is thus an upside - down harmonic oscillator , @xmath29 .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) is the same as the cosmological equation we will discuss in the next section , except that the restriction @xmath4 will not apply to the cosmological problem .",
    "it is amusing to calculate a typical maximum value for the time it takes the pencil to fall , which is surprisingly short . from eq .",
    "( [ 7b ] ) the time to fall to @xmath21 is @xmath30.\\ ] ] for a typical pencil rough values are @xmath31 and @xmath32 so that @xmath33 and @xmath34 \\rm{s}\\approx3.6 \\rm{s}.\\ ] ] the time is very insensitive to the choice of @xmath21 as the final angle .",
    "one can easily balance a pencil for about a second , so this quantum - imposed maximum is not much longer .",
    "finally , note that in one second @xmath35 and @xmath36 , so taking @xmath37 is quite well justified even for relatively short times .",
    "from the amusing but mundane problem of the tipping pencil we proceed to the deeper and more interesting problem of the origin of the universe and its spatial geometry . from the standard starting point of the einstein equations applied to the freidmann - robertson - walker metric",
    "we obtain the friedmann equation for the cosmological scale factor @xmath38 , which is the fundamental equation of cosmology , @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the density of any fluid present in the early universe , not including dark energy , @xmath1 is the cosmological constant at early time ( presumably very much larger than at the present value ) , and @xmath27 is the spatial curvature .",
    "@xcite for a hyperspherical universe the curvature is positive , for a pseudo - hyperspherical universe the curvature is negative , and for a flat universe it is zero .    for the earliest times it is plausible to assume that the universe contains no fluid density and is dominated by the cosmological constant ( equivalent to dark energy ) and the curvature term of unknown sign and magnitude .",
    "this assumption is essentially the same as made in a typical inflation theory , except that a slowly varying field plays the role of the cosmological constant .",
    "@xcite thus we deal with @xmath41 we recognize this as the same equation as the first integral of the tipping pencil eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) with the correspondence @xmath42 and @xmath43 , so we can immediately write the solution in terms of the initial values @xmath44 and @xmath45 as the analog of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) @xmath46 the curvature in terms of the initial values is @xmath47 the cosh and sinh solutions in eq .  (",
    "[ 14 ] ) are of course well - known and correspond to positive and negative values of the curvature .",
    "the amusing physics now enters if we ask why the universe should exist ; that is why should the universe not remain in unstable equilibrium at @xmath48 , rather than have @xmath49 which we observe so readily ?",
    "a reasonable answer is that an uncertainty principle should prohibit @xmath50 so that a quantum fluctuation pushes the universe out of its unstable equilibrium condition , precisely as with the pencil in section 2 . as with the uncertainty principle eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) for the pencil such an uncertainty principle should take the form @xmath51 where @xmath16 and @xmath52 are some characteristic mass and length parameters of the nascent universe , perhaps the planck mass and length for example .",
    "thus we ask that the universe have a minimum scale factor at asymptotically large times consistent with the uncertainty principle and obtain , as in eq .",
    "( [ 7b ] ) , @xmath53 therefore the scale factor is prevented from being zero by the nonzero value of @xmath54 and the universe is forced into existence by the uncertainty principle .",
    "moreover the demand of minimum expansion leads to zero spatial curvature , which is a rather interesting result .",
    "we could ask what reasonable values the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath52 might have and what the coefficient in eq .  ( [ 17 ] ) would then be .",
    "however for @xmath55 the friedmann eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) is scale invariant so the scale factor is arbitrary up to a constant multiplier .",
    "the coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) is thus not observable and the values of @xmath16 and @xmath52 are irrelevant .    in summary , the uncertainty principle eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) serves to destroy the unstable equilibrium and start the expansion of the universe , but any further effects , other than spatial flatness , are thereby erased .",
    "we have presented a scenario for cosmogenesis in which the nascent universe is dominated by a cosmological constant , or dark energy , and curvature .",
    "the universe is prevented from remaining in unstable equilibrium with a scale factor of @xmath48 by the uncertainty principle .",
    "if the subsequent expansion is taken to be minimal then the curvature must be zero .",
    "that is we may view the flatness as the result of a  laziness principle . \"",
    "the scenario is not a quantum cosmology although a quantum effect serves to begin the expansion .",
    "there is thus no difficulty of interpretation common to quantum cosmologies .",
    "this cosmogenesis scenario was developed as an example for a course on the big bang at san francisco state university .",
    "i thank the students in the course for their comments .",
