    "in @xcite a holographic version of the dipole - dipole scattering approach @xcite in the regge limit is used to describe high energy hadron - hadron scattering within the context of holographic qcd . in this limit , the scattering amplitude is dominated by pomeron exchange , i.e. exchange of ordered gluon ladders with vacuum quantum number . the holographic pomeron is argued @xcite to be the exchange of a non - critical , closed string in transverse ads@xmath0 .    using the dipole - dipole scattering approach ,",
    "two wilson loops are correlated via a minimal surface with string tension @xmath1 . in the presence of a large rapidity gap @xmath2 and large impact parameter @xmath3 ,",
    "the closed string exchange is t - dual to an open string exchange subjected to a longitudinal electric field @xmath4 that causes the oppositely charged string end - points to accelerate  @xcite .",
    "this acceleration induces an unruh temperature @xmath5 in the middle of the string worl - sheet . for large impact parameter ,",
    "the unruh temperature is low and only the tachyon mode of the non - critical string is excited .",
    "this tachyonic string mode is diffusive in curved ads@xmath0 , which is reminiscent of gribov s diffusion in qcd .",
    "in particular , the properly normalized diffusion kernel with suitable boundary conditions in the infrared yields a _ wee - dipoles _ density that is similar to the qcd one in the conformal limit .",
    "the convolution of the two _ wee - dipole _ densities yields the eikonalized scattering amplitude and allows for a partonic picture similar to @xcite , albeit at strong coupling .",
    "the holographic , strong coupling description allows to access the saturation regime at small bjorken @xmath6 and small momentum transfer . in @xcite the holographic dipole - dipole cross section",
    "was compared to dis data from hera .",
    "this leads to a fit of the thooft coupling @xmath7 through the slope of the proton structure function @xmath8 , while the remaining parameters were adjusted to be in reasonable agreement with qcd expectations .",
    "the scattering amplitude was obtained both in a confining background with a hard wall , as well as in the conformal limit .",
    "both backgrounds yield a cross section that is comparable to the data .",
    "exclusive diffractive processes such as proton - proton ( @xmath9 ) diffraction and deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) reveal information about the proton shape in the transverse plane .",
    "we will use the holographic dipole - dipole scattering model , @xcite , to describe @xmath9 diffraction and dvcs . at large momentum transfer ,",
    "the holographic differential @xmath9 cross section is sensitive to length scales of the typical string length or @xmath10 . in the confining background it is of the order of the ir cutoff . to get a better fit on the two parameters concerning the effective size of the proton and the ir cutoff , we compare the holographic result for diffractive proton - proton and dvcs cross sections with the data .",
    "the dipole picture has been used to describe exclusive diffractive processes , see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . within the gauge / gravity duality , hadron - hadron scattering and",
    "the holographic pomeron has been discussed in numerous places , see e.g. @xcite . in particular , @xmath9 diffraction was studied in @xcite and dvcs in @xcite .",
    "our construction relies on the holographic results established in  @xcite which involve a non - critical string in @xmath11 dimensions and whereby the pomeron is the tachyon mode at large impact parameter .",
    "they are rooted in the widely used approach to dipole - dipole scattering at high - energy .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we will briefly review the main results of @xcite in section 2 before comparing the differential @xmath9 cross section to cern isr and lhc data in section 3 . a comparison to dvcs data from hera is done in section 4 and the conclusions given in section 5 .",
    "in the dipole - dipole scattering approach at high energies ( @xmath12 ) , the scattering amplitude for the process @xmath13 factorizes and can be written as @xmath14 with transverse impact parameter @xmath15 , rapidity @xmath2 and dipole - dipole amplitude @xmath16 .",
    "the wave functions @xmath17 are parametrized by @xmath18 , with the effective dipole size @xmath19 and the ir cutoff @xmath20 .",
    "the dipole - dipole amplitude is evaluated using the gauge / gravity duality and the virtuality of the scatterers is identified with the holographic direction of the curved space @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in the eikonal approximation",
    "the differential cross section reads @xmath21 with @xmath22 . here",
    ", @xmath23 is the bessel function and the overlap amplitude is defined by @xmath24 .",
    "note that the scattering amplitude in ( [ amplitude ] ) is purely imaginary . in @xcite the eikonal @xmath25 , which is the correlator of two wilson loops ,",
    "was obtained through closed string exchange in a weakly curved , confining space .",
    "the string exchange can be viewed as a funnel connecting the two dipoles at a holographic depth @xmath19 and @xmath26 . identifying these positions @xmath19",
    ", @xmath26 of the endpoints of the funnel with the effective size of the dipoles gives rise to a density @xmath27 of _ wee - dipoles _ surrounding each parent dipole .",
    "for @xmath11 , we identify @xcite @xmath28 we consider transverse ads@xmath0 @xmath29 with a cutoff ( hard wall ) imposed at some @xmath20 . the _ effective _ string tension will be defined as @xmath30 with thooft coupling @xmath7 and @xmath31 the string tension ( in units of the ads radius ) .",

    "the value of the coupling , @xmath43 , is fitted through the slope of the proton structure function @xmath8 in comparison to the dis data .",
    "phenomenological considerations on the saturation scale gives @xmath44 .",
    "these numerical values will be used in the following analysis .",
    "the identification of the radial direction @xmath19 with the dipole size ( inverse virtuality ) and a comparison of the scaling of @xmath45 with @xmath46 to the data confirms @xmath11 .",
    "the effective size of the proton and the position of the ir cutoff were taken as @xmath47 , @xmath48 . while saturation effects become important at low @xmath49 and small bjorken @xmath6 , both the confining result as well as the conformal limit for the scattering amplitude lead to a cross section that is comparable to the dis data .",
    "diffractive proton - proton scattering at small momentum transfer unravels information about the transverse shape of the proton and the large @xmath50 behavior probes lengths scales of the typical string length , which in the confining background is of the order of @xmath20 .",
    "we will fit the effective dipole size of the proton , @xmath51 , and the position of the hard wall , @xmath20 , to the data .",
    "all other numerical values remain the same as in @xcite , see also section 2 .",
    "+ instead of using diffractive eigenstates @xcite , @xcite , perturbative @xcite , @xcite or holographic light - front wave functions @xcite , we will fit the data assuming the proton distribution is identified with the _ wee - dipole _ distribution , i.e. the proton is sharply peaked at some scale @xmath52 , @xcite .",
    "more explicitly , the square of the wave function will be approximated by a delta - function , @xmath53 .",
    "we treat the normalization constant @xmath54 that carries the dipole distribution to the physical proton distribution as a parameter to be fitted to the data .      a comparison of the differential elastic @xmath9 cross section , ( [ dsigmadt ] ) , to the cern isr data @xcite is made by fitting the position of the dip and the slope of the shoulder region ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "we use the full , unitary amplitude including higher order terms in the eikonal @xmath25 . the importance of higher order terms in the eikonalized amplitude",
    "was also noted in @xcite .",
    "a fit yields @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , see figure [ sigmadiff ] . to leading order , the position of the ( first ) dip is sensitive to the effective size of the scatterer and the energy of the scattering object and scales with @xmath59 .",
