    "most of the mass of the kuiper belt between 30 and 50 au appears to reside in a region outside semimajor axis @xmath4 au called the classical kuiper belt @xcite .",
    "early kuiper belt surveys found that kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) can have surprisingly high orbital inclinations @xcite .",
    "recent large - scale surveys @xcite have established that the classical kbos  not just the relatively nearby plutinos  frequently have high orbital inclinations ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the discovery of these high - inclination objects seems to point to unknown processes in the primordial solar system .",
    "several mechanisms for `` pumping - up '' the ancient kbo inclination distribution have been investigated , such as resonant encounters @xcite and perturbations from passing stars @xcite , scattered planets @xcite and planetesimals @xcite .",
    "large kbos that may have existed long ago during the epoch of planet formation could also have stirred the kbo orbits @xcite .",
    "however , theories of the ancient solar system alone can not explain the current kbo orbital distribution .",
    "orbit integrations in the kuiper belt @xcite have shown that the dynamical effects of the massive planets on the kuiper belt have probably removed most of the original kbos over the lifetime of the solar system .",
    "objects removed recently by these processes probably supply today s population of centaurs , short - period comets , and scattered kbos @xcite .",
    "one might ask whether selective removal of objects by interactions with the planets has altered the inclination distribution of the surviving population .",
    "furthermore , debiased estimates of the kbo inclination distribution @xcite suggest that the classical kbos divide into two populations : one dynamically warm , with a typical inclination of @xmath6 , and one dynamically cold , with a typical inclination @xmath7 .",
    "we wonder whether long - term dynamical interactions helped create the apparent two - component distribution .",
    "to understand the role of dynamical stability in shaping the classical kbo inclination distribution and creating centaurs , comets , and scattered kbos , we performed a new large - scale simulation of the dynamics of kbos , integrating the orbits of 1458 test particles in the region of the classical kuiper belt under the influence of gravity from jupiter , saturn , uranus , and neptune .",
    "@xcite performed the most recent previous large - scale integration of orbits in the kuiper belt .",
    "they used an initial grid with fine resolution in semimajor axis , but only sampled a few initial inclinations , and did not integrate the orbits of high - inclination objects @xmath8 for longer than one billion years .",
    "our work complements theirs ; at the cost of coverage in semimajor axis , we focus on exploring the consequences of high inclination and eccentricity over a four - billion - year period .",
    "figure  [ fig : realkbos ] shows the orbital eccentricities and inclinations with respect to the ecliptic plane of the 410 known classical kbos with @xmath9 au sorted into seven panels by semimajor axis , @xmath10 , rounded to the nearest au .",
    "we obtained these data from the minor planet center s website .",
    "filled symbols indicate orbits for kbos observed at multiple oppositions .",
    "the single - opposition orbits , shown as empty squares , generally have accurate inclinations , but poorly measured eccentricities ; often the minor planet center assumes zero eccentricity for single - opposition orbits .",
    "these classical kbos have a mean inclination of @xmath11 .",
    "however , the data reflect a strong observational bias against detecting high - inclination kbos ; high inclination objects spend less time near the ecliptic plane than low - inclination objects .",
    "the figure also reflects severe observational biases against detecting distant kbos .",
    "the brightness of a kbo in reflected light decreases roughly as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the kbo s heliocentric distance .",
    "this distance bias propagates into correlated biases in semimajor axis , eccentricity , and mean anomaly , since most kbos are discovered near perihelion . see @xcite and @xcite for recent discussions of the radial distribution of kbos .    plotted on figure  [ fig : realkbos ] is a family of curves corresponding to constant values of @xmath14 , the component of the orbital angular momentum ( per particle mass ) in the direction perpendicular to the ecliptic plane .",
    "@xmath15 is largest in the lower left - hand corner of each plot ( @xmath16 ) . in a system where all the planets occupy circular orbits in the same plane ,",
    "the orbit of a test particle conserves the component of its angular momentum perpendicular to that plane @xcite .",
    "we would expect the test particles in our simulation to conserve @xmath15 and only evolve parallel to these curves in the absence of semimajor axis variations if all the perturbing planets had @xmath17 with respect to the ecliptic plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : realae ] shows the eccentricities and semimajor axes of the known kbos observed at more than one opposition .",
    "two curves on this figure show the eccentricities corresponding to perihelion distances of @xmath18 au ( the neptune crossing line ) and @xmath19 au .",
    "also , each panel in figure  [ fig : realkbos ] has vertical grey lines indicating @xmath20 au and @xmath19 au .",
    "the dearth of objects with @xmath21 much greater than 39 au in figure  [ fig : realae ] shows the bias towards detecting objects with small perihelia .",
    "forty - seven of the classical kbos with observations at multiple oppositions have orbits with perihelia less than 39 au .",
    "these 47 objects have a mean inclination of @xmath22 , much higher than the mean inclination of the classical kbos as a whole ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "only 11 of these 47 have orbits with perihelion @xmath23 au .",
    "@xcite found that particles with @xmath23 au generally did not survive one billion years of interaction with the giant planets .",
    "grey curves in figure  [ fig : realae ] indicate the boundaries of the 8:5 , 5:3 , 7:4 and 2:1 mean motion resonances ( mmrs ) with neptune , using the planar circular restricted three - body problem as a model for the motion of small bodies in the field of the sun and neptune .",
    "we numerically computed these boundaries following the technique developed by @xcite to avoid relying on analytic expansions of the disturbing function which invoke low eccentricities .",
    "@xcite first applied this approach to mmrs in the kuiper belt .",
    "the resonance widths calculated this way contain a chaotic zone along the boundary at high eccentricities , while the widths calculated by @xcite exclude this region .",
    "this chaos may affect the long - term dynamics and stability of kbos along the resonance boundaries .",
    "we integrated the orbits of 1458 non - interacting particles for 4 billion years under the gravitational influences of jupiter , saturn , uranus , neptune and the sun using the mvs symplectic integrator from the swift package by @xcite based on an algorithm by @xcite .",
    "the initial arguments of pericenter , mean longitudes , and ascending nodes were chosen randomly from a uniform distribution on the interval [ 0,2@xmath24 ) .",
    "we used orbital elements referred to the ecliptic plane , rather than the invariable plane , so they can easily be compared with observations .",
    "we used orbital data for the planets from @xcite and time steps of one year .",
    "the integration required donated time on 20 different sun workstations at the caltech astronomy department and at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics . to minimize network traffic , we recorded the orbital elements of each particle only once every 10 million years .    to check that our choice of a one year step size was small enough",
    ", we integrated the orbits of 100 objects for a billion years in the vicinity of a subtle high - inclination feature ( a=42 , e=0 , i=[60,60.02,60.04,  ,61.98 ] ; see section  [ sec : kozai ] ) , using a step size of 1 year .",
    "then we repeated the integration using the same initial conditions and a step size of 1/4 of a year .",
    "naturally , the final orbits differed due to the non - linearity of the dynamics and the long integration times .",
    "but the final distributions of the orbits in eccentricity and inclination space were indistinguishable .",
    "our initial population of objects had semimajor axes of [ 41 , 42 , 43 ,  , 47 ] au , eccentricities of [ 0 , 1/30 , 2/30 ,  , 8/30 ] and inclinations of [ 0 , 1/30 , 2/30 ,  , 17/30 ] radians ( [ 0.0000 , 1.9099 , 3.8197 , ",
    ", 32.4676 ] degrees ) .",
    "we refer to this grid of 1134 particles , which evenly fills a rectangular prism in ( @xmath10 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) space , as our first batch .",
    "we also performed some exploratory integrations with higher initial inclinations ; at 43 and 45 au , we started particles with inclinations up to 1.1666 radians ( 66.8451 degrees ) .",
    "we removed particles from the integration when they encountered neptune s hill sphere .",
    "six hundred and twenty - six particles from the first batch survived the entire integration .      though the particles began with integral values of semimajor axis , after 10 million years of integration only a shadow of the discrete initial conditions remained .",
    "if we combine all the data in the first batch , we find that by @xmath27 million years , the particles have spread out in semimajor axis into a distribution with half - width at half maximum of 0.4 au . at @xmath28",
    "billion years , the core of the distribution has not changed , but the particles in the wings are gone . only 0.1 % of the particles that survived for 4 billion years were transported farther than 0.7 au from their initial semimajor axes .",
    "we infer that the observed classical kbos have not strayed far in semimajor axis since the planets settled into their current configuration  unless another effect besides long term interactions with the planets disturbed their orbits .",
    "figure  [ fig : simulatedae ] shows the eccentricities and semimajor axes of the particles that survived for 4 billion years .",
    "the eccentricities and semimajor axes have been averaged over the period 3 - 4 billion years ( 100 data dumps ) .",
    "solid diamonds show the averaged orbits of low inclination test particles ( @xmath29 ) ; empty squares show the averaged orbits of high - inclination particles ( @xmath30 ) . in the lower right ,",
    "particles at low @xmath25 and high @xmath10 remain clustered , reflecting the initial conditions .",
    "this zone appears to be stable for the lifetime of the solar system , however few kbos are known with high @xmath10 and low @xmath25 orbits , since the perihelia of these orbits are far from the sun . to the left of the figure , at",
    "@xmath31 au , an inclination - dependent instability appears to have removed many of the low - inclination particles , particularly at perihelia @xmath32 au .",
    "the grey vertical lines indicate the nominal positions of the 8:5 , 5:3 , 7:4 and 2:1 mmrs .",
    "since the plotted orbits are averaged over the resonant librations , the libration widths of the resonances do not appear .",
    "figures  [ fig : realae ] and [ fig : simulatedae ] show that objects with small perihelion distances , @xmath21 , often inhabit mmrs , which can protect them from close encounters with neptune .",
    "the mmrs at @xmath31 au appear to serve double protective duty ; they protect low @xmath21 objects from close encounters , and protect low inclination objects from ejection by the instability that removes low inclination particles ( see sections  [ sec : secularresonances ] and [ sec : comet ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : tenmillion ] shows the orbits of the test particles after ten million years of integration .",
    "the particles are sorted into seven panels by their initial semimajor axes .",
    "diamonds indicate the orbital eccentricity and inclination of the particles that survived the integration for ten million years .",
    "thin lines connect the diamonds to the initial orbits .",
    "crosses indicate the initial positions of particles that suffered close encounters with neptune .    even after this relatively short period , many of the particles at low inclinations @xmath29 have been substantially perturbed , their inclinations raised .",
    "particles with inclinations @xmath33 have generally evolved along lines of @xmath34constant , shown in figure  [ fig : realkbos ] . but so far , only a few low - inclination particles have been removed .",
    "figure  [ fig : fourbillion ] shows the state of affairs after four billion years , summarizing the inclination and eccentricity evolution of the particles in the same manner as figure  [ fig : tenmillion ] .",
    "this figure should be compared to the current distribution of kbo orbits ( figure  [ fig : realkbos ] ) . by this time , most of the low inclination particles whose orbits were greatly perturbed ( the diamonds with the long lines in figure  [ fig : tenmillion ] ) have now been ejected . by four billion years ,",
    "nearly all of the objects with initial perihelion @xmath35 au have been removed .",
    "this cutoff is not even : several objects have been transported into the region @xmath23 au , and at low inclinations @xmath36 , the border of the unstable region is closer to @xmath37 au ( see figure  [ fig : realkbos ] ) .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : fourbillion ] shows a systematic removal of high - eccentricity objects , which vividly demonstrates that creating the high - inclination kbos does not require a special mechanism that only increases inclinations and not eccentricities .",
    "when we discuss the relevance of our simulations to the kbo inclination distribution , we find it convenient to define two zones in the classical kuiper belt , one at @xmath38 au @xmath39 au , the other at @xmath40 au @xmath41 au .",
    "this division cuts the distribution of known kbos roughly in half ; of the classical kbos plotted in figure  [ fig : realkbos ] , 213 fall in the first group ( 84 with multiple opposition orbits ) and 197 fall the second group ( 92 with multiple opposition orbits ) .",
    "the debiased estimate of the radial distribution of kbos by @xcite is also roughly symmetric about 44 au . as figure  [ fig : simulatedae ] shows ,",
    "most of the inclination dependent structure after 4 billion years is located in the first zone , at @xmath31 au .",
    "figure  [ fig : inchistogram ] summarizes the inclination distributions of the two zones , using the first batch of particles ( @xmath42 ) after 10 million , 1 billion , and 4 billion years .",
    "the semimajor axis limits are applied when the distributions are evaluated .",
    "the 1 billion and 4 billion year distributions were averaged over 100 million years ( 10 data dumps ) to cover periodic secular motions and provide better statistics .    after 10 million years ( the dashed line ) , only 9% of the particles have been ejected , but many of the low inclination objects have moved to higher inclination orbits . after 4 billion years , almost half of the particles ( 46% ) are gone , and the region @xmath38 au @xmath39 au has been hit the hardest , especially at low inclinations .",
    "an approximation to the final distribution at 4 billion years ( the solid curves in figure  [ fig : inchistogram ] ) is @xmath43",
    "as far as we know , all dynamical instability is caused by the overlap of resonances .",
    "we performed some additional integrations to help understand the dynamics of the unstable regions in the classical kuiper belt in this context .",
    "the only notable secular resonances from 4147 au are the perihelion and node resonances with neptune ( @xmath44 and @xmath2 ) and the node resonance with uranus ( @xmath1 ) , all of which are nominally located at @xmath45 au @xcite .",
    "figure  3 of @xcite shows that these resonances deplete objects at low inclinations at @xmath464142 au .",
    "however , figure  4 of @xcite shows that these resonances affect the inclinations of particles as distant as @xmath47 au .",
    "our figure  [ fig : tenmillion ] shows in three dimensions a region of stirring in inclination and eccentricity that penetrates all of the 7 panels at low inclinations and high eccentricities .",
    "this region appears to be the broad wing of the zone of influence of the overlapped secular resonances centered at 4142 au , shown in figure  4 of @xcite .    to test this identification",
    ", we integrated the orbits of 72 particles with initial @xmath48 au , @xmath49 , @xmath50 $ ] , @xmath51 $ ] radians ( @xmath52@xmath53 ) .",
    "ten of these particles were removed before 4 billion years , all from initial inclinations @xmath54 radians ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "we plotted pseudo - surfaces of section for all of these particles in various coordinate systems to look for librational motion indicating the presence of a resonance .",
    "all of the particles in this group that were ejected shared a common behavior . figure  [ fig : lowi43 ] shows pseudo - surfaces of section for a typical ejected particle in two coordinate systems : @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 refers to the argument of pericenter , @xmath59 refers to the argument of ascending node , and the subscript n refers to neptune .",
    "the angle @xmath60 circulates , while the orbit undergoes complex motion in the inclination and @xmath61 coordinates , alternating between libration and circulation , while the inclination slowly grows . finding this common behavior indicates that competing nodal resonances ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) dominate the long - term dynamics of these particles .",
    "these competing resonances appear to cause the broad swath of destabilization at low inclinations and high eccentricities apparent in figures  [ fig : simulatedae ] , [ fig : tenmillion ] , [ fig : fourbillion ] , and [ fig : inchistogram ] .",
    "the kozai resonance is the tendency of high inclination orbits in the three - body problem to undergo secular libration of the argument of pericenter , @xmath58 , coupled with oscillations of @xmath26 and @xmath25 , which conserve @xmath15 .",
    "recall that we measure an orbit s argument of perihelion from the ascending node , so in the solar system , this motion corresponds to an oscillation of @xmath58 about the invariable plane .",
    "@xcite made the approximation that the planets all orbit in the same plane , and calculated that in the solar system , these oscillations set in at inclinations of @xmath62 for @xmath63 au .",
    "@xcite calculated that under the same approximation , no region of the kuiper belt should be subject to the kozai resonance .    but figure  [ fig : fourbillion ] shows that the surviving particles around @xmath64 show more eccentricity evolution than other high inclination particles .",
    "the strong inclination dependence of this effect and the way the motion appears to conserve @xmath15 suggest that it is a kozai phenomenon .",
    "we integrated the orbits of 24 particles with initial @xmath48  au , @xmath65 at initial @xmath66,@xmath67 $ ] and initial @xmath68 $ ] and examined the evolution of their orbits to look for librations , using the coordinates @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "figure  [ fig : kozai ] shows three representative pseudo - surfaces of section that illustrate the three types of behavior we found in this region",
    ". figures  [ fig : kozai]a and [ fig : kozai]b show the evolution of particles that survived the integration , while figure  [ fig : kozai]c shows the evolution of one of the two particles ( initial @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) that did not survive .",
    "the points in figure  [ fig : kozai]a fill a roughly circular region , indicating chaotic motion confined to low eccentricities @xcite . in figures  [ fig :",
    "kozai]b and c , the motion appears to be a superposition of this chaotic motion with libration about @xmath73 or @xmath74 , indicated by the loops .",
    "the librational motion indicates the influence of a kozai resonance .",
    "occasionally , a particle at low inclinations in a mmr can also undergo kozai libration @xcite .",
    "when we plotted pseudo - surfaces of section for all of the 1458 particles in the big integration , we found one particle , with initial @xmath75 au , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , that went into libration about @xmath78 .",
    "the orbit of this particle , circled in figures  [ fig : simulatedae ] and [ fig : fourbillion ] , is inside neptune s 5:3 mmr .",
    "the kozai libration may help the mmr protect the particle from doom at the hands of the overlapping secular resonances in this region of dynamical space , since the particle survives for the entire 4 billion years of the integration .",
    "as we mentioned in section  [ sec : observed ] , high - inclination kbos spend less time near the ecliptic plane than low inclination kbos , so they evade ecliptic plane surveys .",
    "@xcite realized that this observational bias could easily be corrected for the subset of low - eccentricity kbos discovered near the ecliptic plane ; for this subset , high inclination objects will be underrepresented by the simple factor of @xmath79 , assuming no correlation between longitude and inclination .",
    "the kozai phenomenon could produce such a correlation , but while kozai libration may be common among plutinos , our integrations in the classical kuiper belt produced only one kozai librator at inclinations @xmath80 .",
    "we used the @xmath79 debiasing method to calculate separate debiased inclination distributions for the inner part of the classical kuiper belt ( @xmath81 au ) and the outer part of the classical kuiper belt ( @xmath82 au ) considering only objects discovered at ecliptic latitude @xmath83 , 209 objects in total .",
    "figure  [ fig : observedinc ] shows these two distributions , with error bars indicating the poisson noise due to the limited number of objects per bin .    as figure  [ fig : inchistogram ] shows , 4 billion years of interaction with the massive planets affects the inclination distribution of particles in the outer half of the classical kuiper belt little , but it could substantially alter the inclination distribution of particles with @xmath31 au .",
    "perhaps the inclination distribution of the inner half of the classical kuiper belt ( figure  [ fig : observedinc]a ) once resembled the inclination distribution of the outer half of the classical kuiper belt ( figure  [ fig : observedinc]b ) .",
    "we have too few objects to make a detailed comparison , but the distribution in figure  [ fig : observedinc]b clearly has relatively more low - inclination objects than the distribution in figure  [ fig : observedinc]a .",
    "figure  [ fig : observedinc]a shows a modest peak at @xmath84 which piques our curiosity . after only 10 million years of interaction with the massive planets , we find that a substantial fraction of test particles at low initial inclinations @xmath85 have been promoted to orbits with higher inclinations @xmath86 ( see figure  [ fig : tenmillion ] and figure  [ fig : inchistogram ] ) .",
    "this promotion generally fortells an eventual close encounter with neptune .",
    "perhaps the peak at @xmath84 in figure  [ fig : observedinc]a represents kbos recently delivered to @xmath87 by some self - interaction of the kbo disk and promoted to @xmath84 on their way toward being hurled into neptune s hill sphere by the overlapped @xmath1 and @xmath2 secular resonances .",
    "the classical kuiper belt may be the primary source of short - period comets , centaurs , and scattered kuiper belt objects .",
    "@xcite found that objects from the kuiper belt that wander into the solar system after a close encounter with neptune have a median dynamical lifetime of only @xmath88 years , so perhaps a substantial fraction of short period comets and scattered kbos were classical kbos less than a billion years ago . to explore the origin of short - period comets , centaurs , and scattered kbos , we examined the particles in our integration which were ejected last from the classical kuiper belt .",
    "figure  [ fig : dead ] shows the initial semimajor axes , eccentricities and inclinations of the particles in our integrations that encountered neptune between @xmath89 billion and @xmath28 billion years .",
    "most ( 85% ) of this population of ejected objects originated on orbits with perihelion distances @xmath90 au .",
    "traingles show the initial orbits of particles ejected between @xmath89 billion and @xmath91 billion years .",
    "asterisks show the initial orbits of particles ejected between @xmath91 billion and @xmath28 billion years .",
    "we were surprised to find that the objects ejected from our simulation between @xmath91 billion years and @xmath28 billion years came exclusively from high initial inclinations ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "objects in our first batch encountered neptune at a rate roughly proportional to @xmath93 for the first 1 billion years , in agreement with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , during the last billion years of the simulation , not one particle from low inclinations ( @xmath29 ) encountered neptune , while 14 particles from higher inclinations ( @xmath94 ) encountered neptune during this interval .",
    "we would expect @xmath95 encounters for the low inclination group during that period if the rate remained proportional to @xmath93 .",
    "naturally , the overlapping secular resonances that create the large region of instability at low inclinations throughout the classical kuiper belt affect the rate of neptune encounters for low - inclination objects .",
    "these secular resonances remove low - inclination objects early on , so relatively few remain at @xmath96 billion years to encounter neptune ; in the region @xmath90 au almost twice as many high inclination ( @xmath94 ) objects survive for 3 billion years as low inclination objects ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "however , this selective removal of low inclination objects does not explain why not a single low inclination object in our simulation encountered neptune from @xmath91 billion to @xmath28 billion years .",
    "enough low inclination objects remain at @xmath28 billion years to provide a significant flux of neptune encounters .",
    "but the secular resonances do not act alone .",
    "mmrs can protect the low - inclination objects from destruction at the hands of the overlapping secular resonances .",
    "the secular resonances may weed out all but the mmr - protected low - inclination objects in the first 3 billion years , so after that time , the only available unprotected objects for them to eject have high inclinations .",
    "figure  [ fig : simulatedae ] shows that at @xmath31 au , all but a few particles with @xmath90 au that survive at low inclinations for 4 billion years ( figure  [ fig : simulatedae ] ) inhabit mmrs .",
    "high inclination particles in this zone are spread more evenly ; some high inclination particles lie in mmrs , but many solid squares fall between the mmrs .",
    "figure  [ fig : realae ] shows that the real kbos mimic the behavior of the test particles which survive 4 billion years ; 12 out of the 15 low inclination ( @xmath29 ) kbos at @xmath31 au , @xmath90 au with multiple - opposition orbits have observed semimajor axes and eccentricities within or near the numerically calculated boundaries of mmrs .",
    "the observed high - inclination kbos are spread more evenly in semimajor axis .",
    "our simulation suggests that todays short - period comets , centaurs , and scattered kbos originate in the high - inclination kbo population .",
    "therefore , short - period comets , centaurs , and scattered kbos should have a color distribution like the high - inclination kbos when they leave the kuiper belt . @xcite found that low inclination kbos are uniformly red ( @xmath97 1.52.2 for @xmath98 ) , while high - inclination kbos range from red to blue ( @xmath97 1.02.0 for @xmath99 ) .    @xcite compared the colors of kbos , centaurs , comet nuclei , and candidate dead comets , and found that the centaurs in his study had a wide range of colors .",
    "this range appears to be consistent with the color range of the high - inclination kbos in @xcite , in agreement with our dynamical result .",
    "more color measurements of centaurs may determine whether the color distribution of centaurs matches the color distribution of the high - inclination kbos in detail .",
    "jewitt s samples of comet nuclei and candidate dead comets had no objects as red as the red high - inclination kbos ; our study offers no solution to the problem of this missing ultrared matter .",
    "dynamical erosion is not the only long - term effect in the classical kuiper belt ; collisions may shape the distributions of kbo orbital elements @xcite .",
    "but as the collision rate and the mass of the kuiper belt decreased with time , the dynamical effects shown by our integrations must have begun to dominate the shaping of the classical kuiper belt .",
    "we found that interactions with the massive planets preferentially deplete low - inclination objects in the inner half of the classical kuiper belt , raising the mean inclination of the population of surviving objects .",
    "however , the outer half of the classical kuiper belt ( @xmath100 au , @xmath101 ) could have retained its ancient inclination distribution .",
    "we also found that objects ejected from the classical kuiper belt during the last 1 billion years of our integration primarily come from initial orbits at high inclinations and eccentricities .",
    "this effect may be caused indirectly by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which remove many low - inclination particles at early times and weed out those unprotected by mmrs .",
    "this finding implies that centaurs , short - period comets and scattered kbos should have an initial color distribution like that of the high - inclination kbos .",
    "measuring of the colors of more centaurs could test this hypothesis .",
    "perhaps the high - inclination kbos separated from the primordial kbos objects during a special event early in the lifetime of the solar system .",

    "<S> we numerically integrated the orbits of 1458 particles in the region of the classical kuiper belt ( 41 au @xmath0 47 au ) to explore the role of dynamical instabilities in sculpting the inclination distribution of the classical kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the selective removal of low - inclination objects by overlapping secular resonances ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) acts to raise the mean inclination of the surviving population of particles over 4 billion years of interactions with jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune , though these long - term dynamical effects do not themselves appear to explain the discovery of kbos with inclinations near @xmath3 . our integrations also imply that after 3 billion years of interaction with the massive planets , high inclination kbos more efficiently supply neptune - encountering objects , the likely progenitors of short - period comets , centaurs , and scattered kbos . </S>",
    "<S> the secular resonances at low inclinations may indirectly cause this effect by weeding out objects unprotected by mean motion resonances during the first 3 billion years . </S>"
