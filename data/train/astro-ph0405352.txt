    "in this section , we analyse the normalised cumulative distributions of the -selected sample and compare it with a purely -selected sample .",
    "this distribution directly impacts measurements of the cosmological mass density , @xmath4 . here",
    ", the -selected sample presented in section 3.1 is compared with the sample of dlas / sub - dlas selected _ only _ on their .",
    "the latter does not include absorbers selected at 21 cm or otherwise but solely -selected systems .",
    "therefore the total sample is now composed of 31 absorbers , 21 of which are -selected .",
    "figure  [ f : cumu ] presents the normalised cumulative  distributions for these .",
    "the -selected curve is different from the other at the high  column density end .",
    "in particular , there are systems with @xmath321.0 in the -selected sample while -selected systems are never found to have  @xmath3 20.8",
    ". this can not be due to a bias in the -selected sample , since that selection method should in principle favour high  column densities . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks )",
    "test shows that the two distributions are consistent at a 0.56 level of probability , but clearly we are dealing with small number statistics . in any case , the sheer fraction of high column density systems will in turn affect the determination of @xmath4 computed directly from the integration of the  distribution function .",
    "further , we find that by comparing systems with @xmath320.3 only , none of the -selected dlas have @xmath3 21 ( out of 4 ) , while 50% ( 5 out of 10 ) of the -selected dlas have @xmath3 21 ( see figure  [ f : rtsel ] ) . assuming a poisson distribution , the probability of obtaining zero -selected dlas at @xmath3 21 when expected 2 ( i.e. half of 4 ) is 13.5% .",
    "therefore the absence of -selected @xmath3 21 systems might also be due to statistical fluctuation .",
    "when all classical dlas are taken into account : only 25% ( 2 out of 8) have  @xmath3 21 even though these have been selected using different techniques .",
    "already rao & turnshek ( 2000 ) note that the comparison of a sample of local gas - rich galaxies studied in 21 cm emission ( @xmath15=0 ) with -selected low redshift dlas ( @xmath15=0.5 ) show an unexpectedly high rate of occurrence of very large column densities .",
    "this could be due to redshift evolution or the selection methods or a combination of both .",
    "therefore , the -selected sample has a higher fraction of @xmath3 21 systems , but only marginally .",
    "given the impact of this on @xmath4 , we try to identify what could be the origin of such a discrepancy by testing various scenarii in the following sections .",
    "another effect possibly at play could be gravitational lensing of the background quasar by the absorber itself .",
    "this could amplify the luminosity of the quasars and therefore make them preferentially selected as they would be easier targets to observe .",
    "in order to check whether gravitational lensing affects differently the two samples of absorbers , we plot the apparent magnitude of quasars for the samples of classical and -selected dlas / sub - dlas . looking at the top panel of figure  [ f : gl ] , we find no evidence that the two populations are composed of quasars with different magnitude ranges .",
    "there might be hints of a trend where higher column density absorbers are found in fainter quasars , probably a signature of extinction by dust ( boiss  1998 ) , but this result is not currently statistically significant .    in order to test further the strong lensing hypothesis , we perform another test .",
    "it is known from gravitational lensing theory that the magnification effects are maximised when the lensing object is midway between the source and the observer _ in physical space_. in our given cosmology , the physical distances can be expressed as :    @xmath16^{-1/2}dz\\ ] ]    in the bottom panel of figure  [ f : gl ] , we plot the ratio of the distance to the absorber over the distance to the quasar .",
    "the configuration which would most favour the occurence of gravitational lensing would have this ratio equal to 0.5 .",
    "in our study , the two samples of absorbers do not show any significant difference .",
    "therefore , gravitational lensing does not appear to be a viable explanation for the observed discrepancy in  distributions of the classical and -selected dlas / sub - dlas .",
    "this finding is further supported by the results of le brun  ( 2000 ) who have used the dla sample of le brun  ( 1997 ) to show that the amplification due to the presence of an absorber along the quasar line of sight does not exceed 0.3 mag .",
    "another scenario would have the absorbers associated with the quasar rather than being truly intervening systems . in order to test this hypothesis",
    ", we compute the velocity difference between the absorbers and the quasars themselves on the basis that the former are actually associated systems .",
    "the @xmath17 in km / s can be expressed as :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the speed of light in km / s .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ f : vel ] .",
    "interestingly , there seems to be a hint of a correlation between  and @xmath20 for the -selected population , while this is not true for the classical dlas / sub - dlas . in any case",
    ", we see no differences between the two samples which could possibly explain their apparent discrepancy in terms of  distributions .    finally , we test for potential evolutionary effects by analysing  as a function of quasar emission redshift ( top panel of figure  [ f : z ] ) and absorber redshift ( bottom panel of figure  [ f : z ] ) . again , we find no obvious trend , and the two populations of quasar absorbers appear to sample the same parameter space .",
    "in this study , we compare the properties of the complete samples of -selected absorbers and more `` classical '' dlas at @xmath1 . constructing well - defined samples",
    "has proven a challenging task given the difficulties to build a homogeneous -selected sample . nevertheless , we find that the metal ew criterion used by rao & turnshek ( 2000 ) to select dlas traces well the population of these systems down to the @xmath319.0 .",
    "moreover , we find that the -selected sample presented has a marginally larger fraction of absorbers with @xmath321.0 than seen otherwise at low redshift .",
    "this property might in turn affect our estimates of @xmath4 which is dominated by the highest  column densities .",
    "we investigate the origin of the potential discrepancy and find that  does _ not _ correlate in a significant way with either metal equivalent widths or ratios of combination of equivalent widths , quasar magnitude , quasar emission redshift , absorber redshift , velocity distance from the absorber to the quasar , or position of the absorber with respect to the quasar in physical space ( a test for the gravitational lensing hypothesis ) .",
    "we conclude that the marginal discrepancy in  distributions between the -selected ones and those discovered with other techniques most likely arises from small number statistics .",
    "we note that regardless of the physical reason for selecting high - column density systems , these absorbers will directly affect calculation of @xmath4 at low redshift .",
    "in particular , comparison of @xmath4 calculations dominated by -selected absorbers at @xmath1 with high - redshift systems selected solely on  might not be appropriate if the two methods are not consistent .",
    "furthermore , if there is a discrepancy between classical and -selected absorption systems and if it holds at high - redshift , it would imply that -selected surveys for dlas / sub - dlas at z@xmath32 have been missing a large fraction of the neutral gas .",
    "since the  method has proven an extremely efficient technique to find low redshift absorbers , we anticipate that forthcoming observations will help extend and refine the current results .",
    "therefore , larger samples are required in order to better constrain @xmath4 at @xmath21 and enable comparison with high redshift results .",
