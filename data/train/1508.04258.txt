    "experiments on synthetic magnetic / gauge fields for neutral atoms  @xcite have enabled realizations of the hall effect  @xcite , famous hamiltonians such as the harper  @xcite and the haldane hamiltonian  @xcite , intriguing topological effects  @xcite , and the observation of synthetic dirac monopoles  @xcite .",
    "there are a few recent reviews on this promising theoretical and experimental progress in synthetic magnetic / gauge fields  @xcite .",
    "the first implementation of synthetic magnetism was in rapidly rotating bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , employing the analogy between the lorentz force and the coriolis force  @xcite .",
    "the methods based on laser - atom interaction employ the analogy between the berry phase in atomic systems  @xcite , and the aharonov - bohm phase for charged particles  @xcite .",
    "the first of them was realized in the nist group with spatially dependent raman optical coupling between internal hyperfine atomic states in bulk becs  @xcite .",
    "methods generating synthetic magnetic fields in optical lattices engineer the complex tunnelling matrix elements between lattice sites  @xcite .",
    "they include shaking of the optical lattice  @xcite , laser assisted tunnelling in optical superlattices realizing staggered synthetic magnetic fields  @xcite , in tilted lattices realizing homogeneous fields  @xcite , and an all - optical scheme which enables flux rectification in optical superlattices  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , radiation pressure has not yet been used among the methods for synthetic magnetism , that is , to create the analogue of the lorentz force . here",
    "we experimentally demonstrate the synthetic lorentz force based on radiation pressure in cold atomic gases .",
    "we measure the dependence of the transverse radiation pressure force ( analogous to the transverse hall deflection ) on the velocity of a cold atomic cloud by observing the centre - of - mass ( cm ) motion .",
    "the observed force is perpendicular to the velocity , and zero for the atomic cloud at rest . this concept based on radiation pressure , theoretically proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is straightforward to implement in a large volume ( e.g. , volumes 1  mm@xmath0 - 1  cm@xmath0 are easily accessible )  @xcite , is applicable for a broad range of velocities , and can be extended to different geometries .",
    "the main reason for the absence of radiation pressure from the previously used methods of synthetic magnetism is the associated heating due to spontaneous emission .",
    "however , this is not an obstacle for atomic gases cooled and trapped in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , where our experiments are performed .",
    "* the basic idea .",
    "* the idea behind our experiment is to drive two - step two - photon transitions between three atomic levels , @xmath2 , with mutually perpendicular laser beams as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] .",
    "two counterpropagating laser beams aligned with the @xmath3-axis drive the @xmath4 transition , whereas the @xmath5 transition is driven by counterpropagating beams aligned on the @xmath6-axis . due to the doppler effect and the perpendicular configuration of the laser beams , both components of the radiation pressure force depend on both components of the atomic velocity : @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this gives us the opportunity to design the detuning values of our lasers such that @xmath9 is positive / negative for atoms with negative / positive velocity component @xmath10 , and that the total force is zero for an atom at rest : @xmath11 .",
    "these are the characteristics of the synthetic lorentz force that we experimentally demonstrate .",
    "the design of the detuning values of the lasers is crucial in obtaining the desired result .",
    "the beams driving the first step of the transition @xmath12 are detuned by the same magnitude , but with the opposite sign .",
    "the one towards the positive @xmath3-direction is red - detuned by @xmath13 , while the other is blue - detuned by @xmath14 .",
    "their intensities are equal .",
    "thus , if just these two lasers were present , the net force on atoms ( of any velocity ) would be zero .",
    "however , the population of level @xmath15 would depend on the velocity @xmath10 , which implies that the rate of transitions @xmath16 giving the transverse force will depend on @xmath10",
    ". the detuning values of the beams driving the second step of the transition , @xmath16 are denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , for the beam propagating in the positive and negative @xmath6 direction , respectively . for now , let us set these values such that @xmath19 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ sketch](b ) .",
    "the two - step two - photon transitions , where absorption of a @xmath16 photon follows absorption of a @xmath12 photon with perpendicular momentum , yield the synthetic lorentz force via momentum transfer from photons to atoms .",
    "given the fact that we have two counterpropagating beams for each transition , we have four excitation pathways for the two - step two - photon transition , denoted by @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , see fig .",
    "[ sketch ] .",
    "the arrows correspond to the direction of the photon s momentum , for example , @xmath22 denotes the pathway where absorption of a photon travelling in the @xmath24 direction is followed by absorption of a photon in the @xmath25 direction and so on .",
    "since the detuning magnitudes of the first step are identical for all pathways ( @xmath26 ) , the relevant quantity is the total detuning for the two - step two - photon transitions .",
    "it is important to note that the total detuning @xmath27 for pathways @xmath22 and @xmath21 , is much smaller in magnitude than the detuning values of @xmath20 and @xmath23 .",
    "the last two are thus negligible in the setup of fig .",
    "[ sketch ] .    to understand the origin of the synthetic lorentz force , we take into account the doppler shift . for an atom moving along the @xmath3-axis with velocity @xmath10 @xmath28",
    ", the @xmath21 pathway is detuned by @xmath29 , i.e. , it is on resonance when @xmath30 .",
    "because photons from the second step of @xmath21 impart momentum towards the positive @xmath6-direction , there will be a positive force @xmath9 for atoms with negative @xmath10 . in the same fashion",
    ", the @xmath22 pathway will be on resonance when @xmath31 yielding negative @xmath9 for positive @xmath10 .",
    "* the experiment . * in the experiment , we use cold @xmath32rb atoms . for the @xmath4 transition we use the d2 transition in @xmath32rb : @xmath33 at 780  nm  @xcite . the easily accessible transition , @xmath34 at 776  nm  @xcite , is used for the second step @xmath5 .",
    "the linewidths of the states are @xmath35  mhz for the @xmath36 state  @xcite , and @xmath37  mhz for the @xmath38 state  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath32rb atoms are cooled and trapped in a standard glass vapour cell magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , arranged in a retro - reflected configuration . in this configuration ,",
    "three orthogonal retro - reflected beams are used to create the total of six beams needed for the mot .",
    "a pair of anti - helmholtz coils provides a quadrupole magnetic field , which together with the laser beams creates a trapping potential ( for example , see ref .",
    "fluorescence imaging of the cloud is performed with a camera aligned along the @xmath39-axis . in typical experimental conditions",
    "we obtain a cloud of @xmath40  mm in diameter , which contains about @xmath41 atoms of @xmath32rb , at a temperature of @xmath42  @xmath43k ( for details of the experimental setup see methods ) .",
    "the four beams implementing the synthetic lorentz force , arranged as in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] , are of much smaller intensity than the mot beams .",
    "therefore , they are negligible when the mot beams are on . for the experimental detection of the synthetic lorentz force",
    ", we turn the mot beams off , as described in detail below .",
    "we need to measure the transverse force @xmath9 in dependence of the velocity @xmath10 of the atomic cloud .",
    "thus , we must prepare a cloud with a given centre of mass ( cm ) velocity . for this purpose",
    "we use an additional pair of current coils that produce a bias magnetic field along the symmetry axis of the anti - helmholtz coils , @xmath3 in our notation here .",
    "the bias field moves the centre of the trap ( the point where @xmath44 ) , which displaces the cloud approximately @xmath45  mm along the @xmath3-axis .",
    "the measurement protocol is as follows .",
    "( i ) we load the trap with the bias magnetic field on .",
    "( ii ) at @xmath46  ms we reverse the bias magnetic field by reversing the current , which suddenly shifts the centre of the trap .",
    "this introduces a force on the cloud due to the mot beams . during the next @xmath47  ms",
    "the cloud accelerates along the @xmath3-axis towards the new trap centre .",
    "( iii ) next we turn off the mot cooling laser and all real magnetic fields .",
    "this moment corresponds to @xmath48 in our presentation .",
    "the system is now simplified because zeeman splitting of hyperfine levels is absent and the radiation force left , arising solely from the lasers implementing the synthetic lorentz force , is not spatially dependent ( it is only velocity - dependent ) .",
    "( iv ) the cloud starts to expand because the trapping is absent , but it also moves in the @xmath49 plane due to both the initial velocity , @xmath50 , and the radiation pressure force .",
    "( v ) after some delay time @xmath51 , the cooling laser is suddenly turned on and the cloud is imaged with the camera . from the trajectory traversed by the cm of the cloud @xmath52",
    ", we can find the force acting on the atoms .",
    "if we wish to image a cloud initially at rest we skip steps ( i ) and ( ii ) . for a given delay time @xmath51 , we repeat the measurement protocol 20 times in identical conditions , and subsequently average to obtain @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the gravity is along the @xmath39-axis in our system ; free fall of atoms due to gravity does not affect the motion in the @xmath49 plane . it should be stated that we perform these measurements first with @xmath5 lasers off , and then with these lasers on , keeping all other parameters identical .",
    "the difference in the path @xmath54 , with lasers @xmath5 on and off , gives us the transverse motion due to the synthetic lorentz force .",
    "* the experimental proof of the synthetic lorentz force by radiation pressure . * the results of the experiment are illustrated in fig .  [ results ] .",
    "we show the trajectory of the cloud @xmath52 , in the presence of the synthetic lorentz force , for three initial velocities : @xmath55  m / s ( squares ) , @xmath56  m / s ( diamonds ) , and @xmath57  m / s ( circles ) ; @xmath58 at @xmath48 in each run of the experiment .",
    "there is a difference in the magnitude of the initial @xmath10 for the positive and negative velocity [ circles and squares in fig .",
    "[ results](a ) ] , which is a result of our mot retro - reflected geometry , and the way we accelerate the cloud in step ( ii ) of the protocol . in order to prepare a cloud with positive @xmath10 , the cloud is accelerated with the incoming mot beam ( coming from the laser side of the setup ) , whereas acceleration in the opposite direction is performed with the reflected beam which has smaller intensity .",
    "the reflected beam intensity is smaller due to the losses , which are a result of the passage of the incoming beam through the dense cloud ( absorption ) , and partially due to reflection .",
    "consequently , the negative initial velocity is smaller than the positive velocity .",
    "for the lasers implementing the synthetic lorentz force , we use the following detuning values : for the first step at 780 nm @xmath59  mhz , and for the second step at 776 nm @xmath60  mhz and @xmath61  mhz .",
    "the two operational two - step pathways are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , whereas the other two are far from resonance .",
    "the intensities of the beams used are @xmath62  mw / cm^2^ and @xmath63  mw / cm^2^ , giving rabi frequencies @xmath64  mhz and @xmath65  mhz .    by inspection of fig .",
    "[ results ] , we see that the cloud travels along the @xmath3-axis by inertia , whereas it accelerates along the @xmath6-axis due to the synthetic lorentz force .",
    "the direction of the force depends on the sign of the velocity @xmath10 ( negative / positive @xmath10 gives positive / negative @xmath9 ) , and the force is zero for a cloud at rest .",
    "we observe an asymmetry in the force @xmath9 , for the positive and negative velocity . in order to justify the exact choice of the detuning values @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and further investigate the observed asimmetry in the measured synthetic lorentz force",
    ", we perform measurements in a slightly simplified configuration .    * measurements in an auxiliary configuration . *",
    "we inspect the force along the @xmath6 direction arising from the two - step two - photon resonances , by using a configuration with three laser beams illustrated in fig .",
    "we block the beam pointing towards the negative @xmath6-direction , and measure @xmath9 arising from the remaining beam ( the positive @xmath6-direction ) , which drives the @xmath16 transition .",
    "the force is measured for an atomic cloud with velocity zero , as a function of the detuning @xmath17 , see fig .",
    "measurements are done for three different detuning values of the first - step 780  nm beams @xmath66  mhz .",
    "the intensities of the lasers driving the transitions are now @xmath67  mw / cm^2^ and @xmath68  mw / cm^2^ , giving rabi frequencies @xmath69  mhz and @xmath70  mhz .",
    "the two maxima in fig .",
    "[ scan ] are profiles of the two - step two - photon resonances : the peak in the vicinity of @xmath71 corresponds to the excitation pathway @xmath20 , and the peak close to @xmath72 corresponds to @xmath21 .",
    "solid lines in fig . [ scan ]",
    "show the theoretically calculated profiles of @xmath9 ( see methods for details of the theoretical calculation ) .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is evident .",
    "all parameter values used in the theoretical calculation are taken from the experiment , except that the rabi frequencies are reduced by @xmath73% .",
    "this is reasonable because in the experiment , the absorption of laser beams across a dense atomic cloud reduces their intensity  @xcite .    it should be pointed out that the peaks in @xmath74 are slightly displaced from the values @xmath75 , towards @xmath76 . for example , for @xmath77 at @xmath78  mhz , the maxima are at @xmath79  mhz .",
    "moreover , the fwhm of the peaks is larger than the linewidth of the state @xmath80 .",
    "these two observations are a consequence of the laser linewidth , which is larger than the linewidth of the state @xmath81 ( see methods ) .",
    "the finite linewidth of @xmath4 lasers at 780  nm distorts the peaks as follows : the side of the peak closer to @xmath76 is lifted up in comparison the opposite side of the peak .",
    "this follows from the fact that the two - step two - photon resonance is stronger when @xmath77 is closer to zero , which is evident from fig .",
    "the exact positions of the peaks at @xmath79  mhz , explain the chosen detuning values for the second step at 776  nm , which were used to obtain fig .  [ results ] : @xmath60  mhz and @xmath61  mhz .",
    "they are chosen such that the operational pathways are effectively equally detuned from the two - step two - photon resonance : @xmath22 is detuned by @xmath82  mhz@xmath83  mhz , and @xmath21",
    "is detuned by @xmath84  mhz@xmath83  mhz .",
    "suppose that we repeat measurements corresponding to fig .",
    "[ scan ] , but for an atomic cloud with mean velocity @xmath10 different from zero .",
    "the results of such measurements would be identical as for @xmath56 , but the positions of the peaks would correspond to the doppler shifted detuning values @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "thus , because detuning can be mapped to velocity space , fig .  [ scan ] can be reinterpreted as measurements for a fixed value of @xmath87 , and for three different velocities @xmath88 ( 4  mhz ) , @xmath56 ( 6  mhz ) , and @xmath89 ( 8  mhz ) .",
    "this is sketched in figure  [ concept ] , where we see that the two peaks separate ( approach ) each other for @xmath89 ( @xmath88 , respectively ) .",

    "[ concept](b ) ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are on the slopes of the two peaks in fig .",
    "[ concept](b ) for an atom with @xmath56 , where the maximal magnitude of @xmath96 is expected ( detuning translates into velocity space via doppler effect ) . for an atom with @xmath88",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ concept](a ) ] , the two peaks approach each other , yielding greater force from the left peak , which results in @xmath91 for @xmath88 , and the opposite for @xmath89 which yields @xmath93 as shown in fig .",
    "[ concept](c ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that our scheme is inherently asymmetric .",
    "the intensity of the resonance peaks shown in fig .",
    "[ concept ] decreases when they separate ( for @xmath89 ) , in contrast to when they approach each other ( for @xmath88 ) .",
    "thus , the net force along @xmath6 is larger for negative @xmath10 , than for the velocity of the same magnitude but with a positive sign . by using a scheme with four atomic levels  @xcite",
    ", one could remedy the asymmetry in the force , present in the three - level scheme .",
    "in addition , the initial density of the atomic cloud is not identical prior to acceleration in the positive / negative direction due to the slight asymmetry of the displaced trapping potential .",
    "this also affects the transverse force due to absorption and multiple scattering  @xcite .",
    "the inherent asymmetry in the force @xmath97 and in the initial density of the cloud , is reflected in the asymmetry of the observed motion in fig .",
    "[ results ] for @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "importantly , all of these details only quantitatively affect the results , but not qualitatively .",
    "the presented experiment , which demonstrates the synthetic lorentz force by using radiation pressure , is performed in a classical cold atomic gas , prepared in a mot , where the heating due to spontaneous emission does not prevent the observations .",
    "the concept of a force is natural in our classical laser cooled system  @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our method is entirely different from the berry phase approach , where the connection with the lorentz force can be made in a semiclassical approximation  @xcite .    in the outlook , we foresee many intriguing novel experiments based on the presented method .",
    "first , one could develop experiments using more sophisticated schemes , involving more atomic levels ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , to create a uniform synthetic magnetic field .",
    "next , we plan to adjust our system for the observation of the predicted rotation of the cloud during expansion  @xcite .",
    "one of the goals of this research is to build up a toroidal trap for cold atoms with a toroidal synthetic magnetic field , which holds potential to emulate the plasma in a tokamak .",
    "the proposed concept could be used for velocity selection of atomic beams , or for developing a novel kind of mass spectrometer for neutral atoms .",
    "we believe that our concept or an analogous scheme could be applicable in other systems , such as suspended nanoparticles .",
    "* experimental setup . * the @xmath32rb mot is set up in the standard @xmath98 @xmath99 retro - reflected configuration , with beam diameters of 2 cm .",
    "the trap is vapour loaded in a glass cell which facilitates fast switching of the magnetic field .",
    "cooling and repumper lasers are external cavity diode lasers ( ecdl ) delivering total powers of 80 mw and 20 mw , respectively .",
    "the cooling laser is typically 2@xmath10024  mhz ( 4@xmath101 ) red - detuned from the @xmath33 hyperfine transition .",
    "the repumper laser is in resonance with the @xmath102 hyperfine transition , thus keeping most of the population in the @xmath103 ground level .",
    "the quadrupole magnetic field gradient is 13  g / cm .",
    "the number of atoms in the trap is deduced by measuring the cloud fluorescence with a calibrated photodiode .    for the implementation of the synthetic lorentz force",
    "two additional ecdl lasers were introduced in the experiment : one at 780 nm driving @xmath33 transition , and other at 776 nm driving @xmath34 transition .",
    "each laser beam is split into two beams which are sent on the rubidium cloud in counter - propagating configurations as shown in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] . frequency and intensity",
    "control is done separately for each of the four laser beams with acoustic - optical modulators ( aom ) . after being frequency shifted , we couple the beams to single mode polarization maintaining fibres , which ensures linear polarization ( in the @xmath39-direction ) and uniform intensity .",
    "all lasers used in the experiment are frequency stabilized by using modulation transfer spectroscopy .",
    "we modulate the laser diode current to modulate the laser frequency , which effectively increases the laser linewidth .",
    "this additional broadening is taken into account in theoretical calculations .",
    "the linewidths were checked by heterodyne beating of two stabilized lasers with similar locking parameters . for locking the laser tuned at 776  nm , we counter - propagate picked off beams from the 776  nm laser and the 780  nm laser through a heated @xmath32rb glass cell , where the 780  nm laser populates the @xmath36 level .",

    "<S> synthetic magnetism in cold atomic gases opened the doors to many exciting novel physical systems and phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> ubiquitous are the methods used for the creation of synthetic magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> they include rapidly rotating bose - einstein condensates employing the analogy between the coriolis and the lorentz force , and laser - atom interactions employing the analogy between the berry phase and the aharonov - bohm phase . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , radiation pressure - being one of the most common forces induced by light - has not yet been used for synthetic magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally demonstrate a synthetic lorentz force , based on the radiation pressure and the doppler effect , by observing the centre - of - mass motion of a cold atomic cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the force is perpendicular to the velocity of the cold atomic cloud , and zero for the cloud at rest . </S>",
    "<S> our novel concept is straightforward to implement in a large volume , for a broad range of velocities , and can be extended to different geometries . </S>"
