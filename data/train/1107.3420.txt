    "the observation that a significant subset of deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) events at hera contain a large gap in activity in the forward region @xcite prompted much theoretical and experimental work .",
    "such large rapidity gap topologies signify a colour singlet or diffractive exchange and hera has proved to be a rich environment for their study .",
    "in particular , the study of diffractive dis ( ddis ) , both inclusive and exclusive , has supplied a wealth of experimental data with a hard scale given by the photon virtuality , stimulating the theoretical understanding of diffraction in terms of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .    it has been shown that the neutral current ddis process @xmath68 at hera obeys a qcd factorisation theorem @xcite .",
    "this allows for a description of ddis in terms of parton densities convoluted with hard scattering matrix elements .",
    "the diffractive parton density functions ( dpdfs ) depend on four kinematic variables , so an additional assumption is often made whereby the proton vertex dynamics factorise from the vertex of the hard scattering , as shown in figure @xmath69 . while this proton vertex factorisation has no complete foundation in theory ,",
    "measurements of ddis from both h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite show that it holds well enough such that next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd fits can be made to the data @xcite .",
    "the dpdfs then depend only on the scale @xmath70 and the fraction @xmath71 of the total longitudinal momentum of the diffractive exchange which is carried by the parton entering the hard scattering",
    ".    measurements of the dijet cross section in ddis allow tests of the dpdfs extracted in fits to inclusive ddis data .",
    "this process , which is known to be dominated by boson - gluon fusion , is particularly sensitive to the poorly known gluon dpdf at large @xmath71 and has thus been used successfully to distinguish between different dpdf sets @xcite .",
    "ddis events containing charm particles in the final state have similarly been used to test the gluon dpdf @xcite .    as in the inclusive dis case , the cross section for ddis can be expressed in terms of a linear combination of structure functions , @xmath72 and @xmath8 @xcite . while @xmath72 describes the total photon - proton process , @xmath8 is only sensitive to the longitudinally polarised photon contribution .",
    "as for its inclusive counterpart , @xmath8 is thus zero in the quark - parton model , but may acquire a non - zero value , @xmath73 in qcd , with leading twist contributions dependent on both the diffractive quark and gluon densities @xcite .",
    "a measurement of @xmath8 provides a powerful independent tool to verify our understanding of the underlying dynamics of diffraction up to nlo in qcd and to test the dpdfs .",
    "this is particularly important at the lowest @xmath71 values , where direct information on the gluon density can not be obtained from dijet data due to kinematic limitations and where novel effects such as parton saturation @xcite or non - dglap dynamics @xcite are most likely to become important .",
    "previous attempts to measure @xmath8 @xcite have exploited the azimuthal decorrelation between the proton and electron scattering planes expected due to interference between the amplitudes for transverse and longitudinal photon polarisations @xcite . however , due to the relatively poor statistical precision of the measurement , the results were consistent with zero .",
    "the h1 collaboration has recently published measurements of the inclusive structure function @xmath74 @xcite using the centre - of - mass energy dependence of the dis cross section at fixed @xmath75 and @xmath70 .",
    "a similar approach has been proposed to extract @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "in addition to measuring @xmath8 itself , it is interesting to compare the relative sizes of the diffractive cross sections induced by transversely and longitudinally polarised virtual photons .",
    "this comparison has previously been made for inclusive dis and exclusive vector meson production through the study of the photoabsorption ratio , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the cross sections for the scattering of longitudinally and transversely polarised photons , respectively . whilst @xmath79 is only weakly dependent on kinematic variables in the dis regime for inclusive cross sections @xcite , a strong dependence on @xmath70",
    "is observed for vector meson production @xcite , the longitudinally polarised photon cross section becoming much larger than its transverse counterpart at large @xmath70 .",
    "since ddis incorporates vector meson production and related processes at large @xmath71 , but exhibits kinematic dependences which are similar to those of inclusive dis at low @xmath71 , it is not easy to predict its photoabsorption ratio . by analogy with the inclusive dis case , we define @xmath80 for diffraction .",
    "the double ratio @xmath81 thus measures the relative importance of the longitudinally and transversely polarised photon cross sections in diffractive compared with inclusive scattering .    in this analysis ,",
    "positron - proton collision data taken at different proton beam energies with the h1 detector at hera in the years @xmath5 and @xmath6 are used to measure the diffractive cross section at intermediate and large inelasticities @xmath82 .",
    "dedicated low and medium energy ( lme ) data with proton beam energies of @xmath83 and @xmath84 are analysed together with data at the nominal beam energy of @xmath85 .",
    "previously published data at a proton beam energy @xmath86 @xcite are used in addition .",
    "the positron beam energy is @xmath87 in all cases .",
    "these cross sections are used to extract @xmath8 together with the ratio @xmath88 and the double ratio @xmath81 .     or @xmath89 .",
    "the dotted line indicates where the diagram can be divided under the assumption of proton vertex factorisation . ]",
    "the kinematic variables used to describe inclusive dis are the virtuality of the exchanged boson @xmath70 , the bjorken scaling variable @xmath75 and the inelasticity variable @xmath82 , defined as : @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the four - momenta of the incoming and outgoing positrons , respectively , and @xmath93 is the four - momentum of the incoming proton .",
    "they are related to @xmath94 , the square of the centre - of - mass energy , by @xmath95 .    in diffractive events",
    ", the hadronic final state can be divided into two systems @xmath96 and @xmath97 which are separated by the largest gap in rapidity .",
    "a diagram for the ddis process is shown in figure @xmath69 .",
    "the system @xmath97 is either the elastically scattered proton , which is the dominant state in the kinematic range studied here , or its low mass excitations .",
    "in addition to the standard dis variables and the squared four - momentum transfer at the proton vertex , @xmath98 , the kinematic variables @xmath99 and @xmath100 are useful in describing the diffractive dis interaction .",
    "they are defined as : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the four momentum of the elastically scattered proton or of its low mass excitation .",
    "the variable @xmath99 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the proton carried by the diffractive exchange and @xmath100 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the struck quark with respect to the diffractive exchange , such that @xmath103 . in the simple quark - parton model , @xmath104 , while for higher order processes , @xmath105 .",
    "the results are discussed in terms of a diffractive reduced cross section , @xmath106 , related to the measured differential cross section by : @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "the diffractive reduced cross section is related to the diffractive structure functions by : @xmath109 due to the suppression term @xmath110 , the diffractive reduced cross section is only sensitive to @xmath8 at large values of @xmath82 .    as the final state system @xmath97 is not measured in this analysis , the cross section is integrated over ranges in its mass @xmath111 and in @xmath98 .",
    "these ranges are chosen to be @xmath112 corresponding to the acceptance of the h1 detector in the forward direction and for consistency with previous measurements .",
    "the relationships between the diffractive structure functions and the dpdfs have been shown to be analogous to those of the inclusive case in the limit where the proton mass and @xmath98 may be neglected compared with other relevant scales in the interaction @xcite .",
    "the diffractive dis structure function @xmath72 is then directly sensitive to the singlet quark dpdf and the scaling violations , @xmath113 , provide a measure of the gluon dpdf .",
    "nlo qcd fits to @xmath114 at low to intermediate @xmath82 values , sometimes supplemented by dijet data , thus provide dpdfs which lead to predictions of @xmath8 at leading twist . by analogy with the inclusive case @xcite and assuming collinear factorisation @xcite , the nlo expression for @xmath115 in the @xmath116 scheme is @xmath117,\\ ] ] where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the quark and gluon dpdfs and @xmath120 is the electric charge of quark flavour @xmath91 . at the relatively large @xmath100 values at which @xmath8 can be measured at hera , both the quark and the gluon densities are predicted to make important contributions to @xmath8 , despite the dominant role played by gluons in ddis in general @xcite .    in this paper , the @xmath8 measurement",
    "is compared with predictions derived from two nlo qcd fits to inclusive ddis @xmath114 data @xcite , which are labelled ` h1 2006 dpdf fit  a ' and ` h1 2006 dpdf fit  b ' .",
    "proton vertex factorisation is assumed in both cases and the diffractive quark densities are very similar in the two fits .",
    "however , the two dpdf fits differ in their parameterisations of the gluon density , which leads to considerable differences at large fractional momenta @xmath71 @xcite , where the constraints from inclusive ddis data are poor .",
    "corresponding differences are visible between the fit  a and fit  b predictions for @xmath8 .",
    "the ` h1 2006 dpdf fit  b ' dpdfs give the better description of diffractive dijet production at hera @xcite and are therefore used as the default here .    a complementary approach to modelling diffractive dis",
    "is offered by dipole models @xcite .",
    "viewed in the proton rest frame , the incoming virtual photon fluctuates into a @xmath121 pair or higher multiplicity state , whose scattering strength from the target is governed by a universal dipole cross section .",
    "dipole models which are applicable to ddis generally contain three contributions @xcite : leading twist terms corresponding to the scattering of @xmath121 and @xmath122 dipoles derived from fluctuations of transversely polarised photons , and a higher twist contribution ( suppressed like @xmath123 ) in which @xmath121 dipoles are obtained from longitudinally polarised photons .",
    "dipole models thus tend to neglect the leading twist contribution to @xmath8 which emerges naturally from nlo dpdf fits .",
    "however , the higher twist contribution to @xmath8 is of particular interest , since it can be predicted in perturbative qcd @xcite , by coupling a @xmath121 dipole to a two - gluon exchange in a similar phenomenology to that successfully applied to vector meson cross sections at hera @xcite . in many dipole - inspired models ,",
    "this higher twist component is the dominant feature of @xmath114 at large @xmath100 and low - to - moderate @xmath70 .    in a recent hybrid approach to fitting @xmath114 @xcite ( labelled ` golec - biernat & uszczak ' here ) , the leading and higher twist contributions to @xmath8 are included simultaneously .",
    "a parametrisation similar to that in @xcite is used for the diffractive quark and gluon dpdfs , but the higher twist longitudinal photon contribution is also included via the parametrisation employed in @xcite .",
    "the quality of the fit to the @xmath114 data is similar with and without the higher twist term .",
    "however , its inclusion leads to a sizeable effect on the diffractive gluon density at large fractional momenta and the higher twist contribution dominates the resulting predictions for @xmath8 for @xmath124 at the lowest @xmath70 values considered here .",
    "a detailed description of the h1 detector can be found elsewhere @xcite and only the components essential to the present analysis are briefly described here . the origin of the h1 coordinate system is the nominal @xmath125 interaction point at the centre of the detector , with the direction of the proton beam defining the positive @xmath71-axis ( forward direction ) .",
    "the polar angle ( @xmath126 ) is defined with respect to this axis and the pseudorapidity is defined as @xmath127 . the azimuthal angle",
    "@xmath128 defines the particle direction in the transverse plane .",
    "the analysis uses several of the tracking detectors of h1 , relying primarily on the two concentric central jet chambers ( cjc ) and the central silicon tracker ( cst )  @xcite , which measure the transverse momenta of charged particles in the angular range @xmath129 , together with the backward silicon tracker ( bst ) , which is positioned around the beam - pipe in the backward direction .",
    "complementary tracking information is obtained from the @xmath71 drift chamber coz , which is located in between the two cylinders of the cjc , the forward silicon tracker ( fst ) and the forward tracking detector ( ftd ) . the central inner proportional chamber ( cip )  @xcite provides trigger information on central tracks , the fst and bst are used to improve the overall vertex reconstruction and the ftd is used to improve the hadronic final state reconstruction of low momentum particles in the forward direction .",
    "in the backward region @xmath130 , a lead - scintillating fibre calorimeter ( spacal ) is used for the identification and measurement of the scattered positron , with an energy resolution for electromagnetic showers of @xmath131 .",
    "importantly , it also provides a trigger down to positron energies of @xmath132 .",
    "the hadronic section of the spacal is used in the reconstruction of the hadronic final state , especially at the high  @xmath82 values accessed in this analysis . the liquid argon ( lar )",
    "calorimeter covers the range @xmath133 and is also used in this analysis in the reconstruction of the hadronic final state .",
    "it has an energy resolution of @xmath134 for hadronic showers , as obtained from test beam measurements  @xcite .",
    "several of the forward detectors of h1 are used in conjunction with the lar to determine whether or not an event contains a large rapidity gap close to the outgoing proton direction .",
    "the forward muon detector ( fmd ) comprises two sets of three drift chambers , separated by a toroidal magnet , covering the range @xmath135 .",
    "only the three layers closest to the interaction region are considered in this analysis .",
    "a dedicated reconstruction algorithm efficiently detects secondary particles produced through the interactions of proton dissociation products with the beam - pipe or other accelerator elements , giving the fmd an effective coverage extending to around @xmath136 .",
