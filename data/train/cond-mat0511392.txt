    "are concerned , their interpretation seems correct .",
    "however , we have shown other magnetization results which are incompatible with the single domain scenario .",
    "as described in the previous section , the bifurcation of the zfc and fc magnetization curves is seen only for the [ 100 ] field orientation in fig .",
    "if we simply take a single domain structure with cubic magnetic anisotropy into account , the zfc curve should follow the fc curve irrespective of field orientations .",
    "thus , we need alternative description which explains the bifurcation of zfc and fc magnetization - cluster / matrix model .    in general , ( ga , mn)as with a high hole concentration is believed to have [ 110 ] uniaxial anisotropy and ( ga , mn)as clusters in the cluster / matrix model likely have [ 110 ] magnetic easy axis.@xcite when such a sample is cooled down to a measurement temperature in zero field , the initial magnetic orientation of the clusters at the low temperature is completely random .",
    "once a small magnetic field is applied along [ 110 ] , the magnetization of the clusters is immediately aligned along [ 110 ] due to the intrinsic [ 110 ] anisotropy of the clusters . on the other hand , if magnetic field is applied along [ 100 ] after zero field cooling , the magnetization of clusters is hard to be aligned along [ 100 ] , resulting in the bifurcation of zfc and fc magnetizations only along [ 100 ] .",
    "thus this description based on our previous interpretation explains the experimental data comprehensively.@xcite     as a function of temperature for various ac field orientations.,width=321 ]    moreover , we have found that the ac susceptibility of a long time annealed sample shows a peak at @xmath29 for the ac field orientation along [ 1@xmath310 ] nevertheless no switching of the magnetic easy axis in fig .",

    "if we assume the cluster / matrix model again , the no switching behavior of the magnetic easy axis can be understood through the growth of the cluster phase with annealing and the consequent decrease in the magnetic inhomogeneity . in other words , the cluster region with [ 110 ]",
    "uniaxial anisotropy in an as - grown sample becomes dominant after annealing , while the volume of the matrix phase with @xmath2 cubic anisotropy in the as - grown sample decreases , resulting in another mixed phase in which the majority of the sample are composed of the phase with [ 110 ] uniaxial anisotropy.@xcite    edmonds _",

    ", there are a few possible mechanisms of magnetic interaction between particles.@xcite in general , dipole - dipole interactions between particles are primarily important for such systems .",
    "direct exchange interaction via the surface of particles are also present , given the particles are in close contact with each other .",
    "however , the content of clusters in the ( ga , mn)as film is not significant so this contribution to the magnetic interaction between particles is almost negligible.@xcite if particles are embedded in a metallic matrix , rkky interaction may be expected .",
    "this might be the case for ( ga , mn)as , since ( ga , mn)as clusters are embedded in the matrix with hole carriers which mediate the interaction between the clusters.@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) , the constant value of @xmath55 which is independent of temperature in this temperature regime , i.e. , @xmath64/@xmath30 @xmath45 0.8 , is also compatible with the description of magnetic interaction as seen in metallic spin - glass @xcite and an assembly of magnetic particles .",
    "given a non - interacting clusters assembly in the temperature regime ( 2 ) , on the other hand , the long time relaxation of the magnetization could be represented by a nel - brown model , i.e. , @xmath35 @xmath13 @xmath66exp(@xmath67@xmath68/@xmath69@xmath64),@xcite where @xmath66 is the inverse of the frequency of a cluster to reverse the magnetization , @xmath67@xmath68 is the anisotropy energy , and @xmath69 is the boltzmann s constant .",

    "the discrepancy between @xmath44 obtained in this study and the general feature may be associated with the very narrow temperature range from 56.5 k to 60.0 k used in this study .",
