    "is a special place reserved in the spectral analysis literature for the maximum entropy ansatz , and rightly so , due to the multitude of analytic , computational , and practical qualities of maximum entropy spectra .",
    "the relevant theory is firmly rooted in analytic interpolation , the moment problem , and the hilbert space geometry of random processes .",
    "the _ maximum entropy _ ( _ me _ ) _ ansatz _ , in its basic form , calls for selecting the unique power spectrum which is consistent with a known finite set of autocorrelation moments and is the maximizer of a convex logarithmic functional which represents the entropy rate of the underlying random process .",
    "a closely related alternative justification relies on the fact that this _ maximum entropy process _ ( _ me process _ ) is the least predictable from past observations and hence , it represents a worst - case situation .",
    "the entropy rate of a random process is an inherently time - dependent concept .",
    "this fact becomes apparent in multivariable prediction theory where the variance of optimal least - variance predictors depends on the choice of the time - arrow ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 3 ) .",
    "it is our contention that often there is no natural direction of time .",
    "this is the case when statistics are obtained from an array of sensors and the index of the autocorrelation moments represents spacial separation .",
    "it is the case when we consider sparse records with both , past and future data available but with possible gaps .",
    "it is also the case , when we want to estimate the power spectrum and have no plans to use it for prediction in one way or another . in all such cases the rationale of the me ansatz",
    "may be called into question .",
    "hence , the purpose of this work is to study a time - arrow independent counterpart . in this , a power spectrum is selected so that the underlying random process evaluated at any point in time is the least predictable from the complete set of all other past and future values .",
    "in other words , it is the variance of the optimal smoothing filter which is sought to be maximal , as opposed to the variance of the optimal ( time - arrow dependent ) predictor .",
    "power spectra which are consistent with a finite set of ( contiguous ) autocorrelation statistics and correspond to a worst - case smoothing error for the relevant random process , turn out to have an all - pole representation , very much like the ones that result in from the me ansatz but with one important difference .",
    "these spectra are inverses of the _ square root _ of positive trigonometric polynomials , and hence , their poles are fractional .",
    "they also share a similar property with me spectra in that they are extrema of a corresponding convex functional which , however , is no longer logarithmic .",
    "computation of their respective parameters is slightly more involved than having to solve linear ( yule - walker - levinson ) equations .",
    "they can be computed as fixed points of suitable differential equations originating from a homotopy - based method in determining functional extrema . for convenience , and lacking a better terminology , we refer to this new class of spectra and the respective processes as _ most random _",

    "as explained in the introduction , we consider the problem of spectral analysis based on partial autocorrelation statistics .",

    "we have now established claims ( i ) and ( ii ) of theorem [ computation ] .",
    "i.e. , we have shown that as @xmath71 in ( [ diffeq2 ] ) the trajectory @xmath69 converges in @xmath210 , and that the limit point @xmath75 is such that ( [ moment ] ) holds . claim ( iii ) of the theorem follows from the concavity of @xmath188 . more specifically , the functional form of @xmath277 guarantees that it is a minimizer of @xmath188 .",
    "there can only be one such minimizer since @xmath188 is strictly concave .",

    "( to see this note that any possible component of @xmath282 which is orthogonal to the subspace of toeplitz matrices has no effect since it vanishes when taking the inner product @xmath283 for any toeplitz matrix @xmath284 as done in ( [ lo ] ) . )",
    "the minimizer @xmath99 would correspond to a measure @xmath26 with a nontrivial singular part only if the equality constraint in ( [ inequalityconstraint ] ) is not active . for this to be the case , the multiplier @xmath285 of @xmath259 in ( [ lo2 ] ) must vanish at least for some values of @xmath286 .",
    "however , the correspondence @xmath287\\ ] ] shows that in fact @xmath288 , i.e. , it is the same lagrangian as in section [ functionalform ] .",
    "the value for the lagrange multipliers in the latter , as identified in section [ proofofcomputation ] , are such that @xmath289 is a positive trigonometric polynomial .",
    "this polynomial is precisely the multiplier of @xmath259 in ( [ lo2 ] ) and is strictly positive for all @xmath290 $ ] .",
    "hence , the equality constraint in ( [ inequalityconstraint ] ) is active for the extremal @xmath99 of the relaxed problem corresponding to ( [ lo ] ) .",
    "then , the analysis in section [ functionalform ] applies .",
    "therefore , the minimizer corresponds to an absolutely continuous power spectral distribution @xmath291 which is of the form claimed in the theorem .",
    "we now address the remaining claims in the theorem regarding the variance of the smoothing error for the corresponding random process . given the expression for @xmath277 which is the square root of the inverse of a positive trigonometric polynomial , the form of the optimal smoothing filter for the corresponding random process is provided by theorem [ prop : minvalue ] .",
    "it is a consequence of the same theorem that the variance of the optimal smoothing error @xmath292 is precisely the inverse of the @xmath293-functional evaluated at @xmath277 , i.e. , @xmath294 the last part of the theorem is also immediate since @xmath295 is @xmath296 for any spectral measure consistent with ( [ moment ] ) .",
    "but @xmath37 is the unique maximizer of this inverse .",
    "for illustration purposes , we compare the power spectra @xmath29 and @xmath277 given in theorems [ metheorem ] and [ thm2 ] for a basic example .",
    "we begin by evaluating the first @xmath297 autocorrelation moments for the following spectral density : @xmath298 here , for convenience , we depart slightly from our earlier notation and incorporate the singular part of the power spectrum into the `` spectral density '' as a sum of two dirac functions the distributions @xmath299 for @xmath300 . thus , the absolutely continuous part of the power spectrum is made up of only the continuous portion @xmath301 of @xmath302 .",
    "the corresponding random process consists of a random moving average component generated by @xmath303 with @xmath304 a white - noise process with variance @xmath305 ( normalized so that @xmath306 ) , and a deterministic sinusoidal component at frequency @xmath307 [ rad / unit of time ] .",
    "the first @xmath297 samples of the autocorrelation function of @xmath308 ( with @xmath309 , say , uniformly distributed on @xmath38 $ ] ) can be readily computed and are as follows : @xmath310 \\\\ & & = \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}3.0000    & 2.1552   &   1.0806 &    0.1415\\end{array}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding toeplitz matrix @xmath311 is positive definite , and as a result , there is a nontrivial family of power spectra which are consistent with the autocorrelation data @xmath312 is only of them .",
    "figure [ powerspectra ] shows the three particular power spectra that concern us here .",
    "first , the `` moving - average @xmath158 sinusoids '' power spectrum described above is shown with a dashed line ( @xmath313 ) .",
    "then , a me - power spectrum which is consistent with @xmath311 and obtained following the maximum entropy ansatz is shown with a dash - dotted line ( @xmath314 ) .",
    "finally , the mr - power spectrum corresponding to the least smooth process is shown with a continuous line ( - ) .",
    "_ all three power spectra shown are consistent with the covariance data_. hence , there is no suggestion that one should be preferable .",
    "they all describe the same data .",
    "a selection can only be based on either prior information or a prejudice this is where an `` ansatz '' becomes relevant .",
    "had we known that the `` true '' spectrum originates from a moving average component plus a minimal number of sinusoids , we could have recovered the exact power spectrum from the covariance data following e.g. , @xcite .",
    "of course , such knowledge is rarely available and one is called to use other insights .",
    "thence , if the power spectrum and a model for the process is to be used for prediction purposes , the maximum entropy option is quite natural since it represents the relevant `` worst - case senario . ''",
    "however , if the model is to be used for filling in gaps in records , then the mr - option is the appropriate `` worst - case senario . ''",
    "then , if our goal is to simply identify features in the power spectrum , either may be appropriate .    using ( [ orthogonalpoly ] )",
    "we determine that @xmath315 with @xmath316 , and @xmath317\\\\ & & = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}-0.9026    & 0.1829 &    0.1465\\end{array}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , following theorem [ computation ] we compute @xmath318 with @xmath319\\\\ & & = \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc } 3.4942   & -2.5690   &   0.9598 &   -0.1231\\end{array}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or , equivalently , @xmath320 and @xmath321\\\\ & & = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc }    -1.7673   &   1.1795   & -0.1956\\end{array}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , again , we depart slightly from our earlier notation so as to compare the coefficients more directly to the me - spectral density . the parameters @xmath322 and @xmath51 as in theorem [ thm2 ] for @xmath277 and smoothing filter , respectively , can be readily determined from the above .",
