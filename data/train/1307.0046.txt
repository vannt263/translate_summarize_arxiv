    "in this paper , we consider the initial boundary value problem @xmath13 of stroock and williams @xcite ( see also @xcite ) where @xmath1 and the boundary condition is not of feller s type when @xmath14 ( cf .",
    "if @xmath15 , then it is known that the solution to ( [ 1.1])([1.3 ] ) with @xmath16 can be represented as @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 starts at @xmath19 under @xmath20 , behaves like brownian motion with drift @xmath7 when in @xmath21 , and exhibits a sticky boundary behaviour at @xmath9 .",
    "the process @xmath18 can be constructed by a familiar time change of the reflecting brownian motion @xmath6 with drift @xmath7 ( the inverse of the running time plus the local time of @xmath6 at @xmath9 divided by @xmath12 ) forcing it to spend more time at @xmath9 ( cf .",
    "@xcite , page  186 ) .",
    "if @xmath22 , then ( [ 1.4 ] ) remains valid with @xmath18 being absorbed at @xmath9 ( corresponding to the limiting case of infinite stickiness ) . if @xmath14 , then feller s semigroup approach ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) is no longer applicable since the speed measure of @xmath18 can not be negative .",
    "stroock and williams  @xcite show that the minimum principle breaks down in this case ( nonnegative @xmath2 can produce negative @xmath11 ) so that the solution to ( [ 1.1])([1.3 ] ) can not be represented by ( [ 1.4 ] ) where @xmath18 is a strong markov process which behaves like brownian motion with drift @xmath7 when in @xmath21 ( for connections with feller s brownian motions see @xcite , section  5.7 ) .    motivated by this peculiarity , stroock and williams @xcite show that the solution to ( [ 1.1])([1.3 ] ) is still generated by a semi - group of operators when @xmath14 and they characterise nonnegative solutions by means of the riccati equation .",
    "this leads to subspaces of functions @xmath2 for which ( [ 1.4 ] ) remains valid with the same time - changed brownian motion @xmath6 with drift @xmath7 that now jumps into @xmath21 or possibly to a coffin state just before hitting @xmath9 .",
    "this representation of the solution is applicable when @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the minimal nonnegative solution to the riccati equation . for more details and further fascinating developments along these lines ,",
    "see @xcite .    inspired by these insights , in this paper we develop an entirely different approach to solving ( [ 1.1])([1.3 ] ) probabilistically that applies to smooth initial data @xmath2 vanishing at @xmath25 with no further requirement on its shape .",
    "first , exploiting higher degrees of smoothness of the solution @xmath11 in the interior of the domain ( which is a well - known fact from the theory of parabolic pdes ) , we reduce the _ sticky _ boundary behaviour at @xmath9 to ( i ) a _ reflecting _ boundary behaviour when @xmath26 and ( ii ) an _ elastic _ boundary behaviour when @xmath27 .",
    "second , writing down the probabilistic representations of the solutions to the resulting initial boundary value problems expressed in terms of the reflecting brownian motion with drift @xmath7 and its local time at  @xmath9 , choosing joint realisations of these processes where the initial point is given explicitly so that the needed algebraic manipulations are possible ( making use of the extended lvy s distributional theorem ) , we find that the following probabilistic representation of the solution is valid : @xmath28,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a reflecting brownian motion with drift @xmath7 starting at @xmath19 under @xmath20 , and @xmath8 is the local time of @xmath6 at @xmath9 .",
    "the function @xmath29 is explicitly given by @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the derivation applies simultaneously to all @xmath7 and @xmath12 with no restriction on the sign of @xmath12 , and the process @xmath6 ( with its local time ) plays the role of a fundamental solution in this context ( a building block for all other solutions ) .",
    "since @xmath33 is a markov process , we see that the solution @xmath11 is generated by the semi - group of transition operators @xmath34 acting on @xmath2 by means of ( [ 1.5 ] ) and ( [ 1.6 ] ) ( in the reverse order ) .",
    "moreover , it is clear from ( [ 1.5 ] ) and ( [ 1.6 ] ) that the solution can be interpreted in terms of @xmath6 and its creation in @xmath9 at rate proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "note that this also holds when @xmath14 in which case the feller s semi - group approach based on the probabilistic representation ( [ 1.4 ] ) is not applicable .",
    "finally , invoking the law of @xmath10 we derive a closed integral formula for @xmath11 expressed in terms of @xmath7 , @xmath12 and @xmath2 . integrating further by parts yields a closed formula for @xmath11 where smoothness of @xmath2 is no longer needed .",
