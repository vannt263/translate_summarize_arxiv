    "thanks to several studies using optical or near - infrared ( nir ) integral field unit ( ifu ) spectroscopy of  emission from local and high - redshift ( @xmath4 ) galaxies @xcite , our understanding of galaxy formation has changed significantly in the past decade .",
    "for instance , these surveys have shown that a significant subset of high - redshift galaxies have a disklike morphology and show organized rotation , with regular velocity fields .",
    "in contrast to low - redshift studies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , high - redshift ( @xmath5 ) galaxies are observed at a spatial resolution that is severaly limited by the seeing conditions owing to their small apparent angular sizes . in order to overcome the low spatial resolution , observations with adaptive - optics ( ao )",
    "are often required @xcite .",
    "however , observations with ao are expensive , with the additional instrumental costs , and add strong observational constraints such as the additional exposure times required to compensate for the loss in surface brightness ( sb ) sensitivity @xcite .",
    "indeed , the sb limit for ao observations taken on smaller pixels is higher , leaving the current state - of - the art observations to the objects with the highest sbs .    given these challenges and the advancements in multiplexing ifu observations with the very large telescope ( vlt ) second - generation instruments like kmos @xcite and the multi - unit spectrograph explorer ( muse ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is important to have tools that can give robust estimates on the galaxy physical properties . in particular , kmos will bring large statistically significant samples of high - redshift galaxies as it can observe 24 galaxies at a time , but this facility will always lack an ao unit .",
    "this could potentially be a serious limitation since the robustness of the derived kinematic parameters may depend on the quality of the atmospheric conditions ( seeing can range from 04 to @xmath610 in the nir ) .    in order to overcome these limitations , we present a new tool named galpak@xmath7  ( galaxy parameters and kinematics )   designed to be able to disentangle the galaxy kinematics from resolution effects over a wide range of conditions .",
    "this is not the first code to model galaxy kinematics from 3d data ( e.g. the tirific package , which performs tilted ring model fits to three - dimensional radio data ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this code performs disk model fits to three - dimensional ifu data cubes , for the first time ,  , whereas all other modeling of ifu - data so far have worked from the two - dimensional velocity field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this paper is organized as follows : we describe the galpak@xmath8 algorithm in section  [ section : galpak ] .",

    "we present results from an extensive analysis of @xmath1   synthetic galaxies in section  [ section : simu ] , where we discuss the impact of the accuracy in the point - spread - function ( psf ) characterization . in section  [ section : leo ] , we present an analysis of data cubes generated from hydrodynamical simulations of isolated disks from michel - dansac et al .",

    "we summarize this paper in section  [ section : conclusions ] . throughout , we use the following cosmological parameters : @xmath9  km  s@xmath3 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "in this section we outline the algorithm principles , which are designed to be able to determine galaxy morphokinematic parameters from the three - dimensional data cube directly .",
    "we discuss the merits of using the parametric forward fit and its limitations .      traditionally , kinematic analyses use two - dimensional maps generated by applying line - fitting codes to determine the line wavelength centroids and widths , which are only considered to be reliable for spaxels with sufficiently high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios . this s / n condition is easily met at low redshifts , but is harder to meet for small , high - redshift galaxies . in principle , the choice to work in 2d or 3d space is equivalent , but we will show that our method can work in the regime ( on the spaxels ) where the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) per pixel ( snr pixel@xmath3 ) is not sufficient for line - fitting codes , which require a minimum snr on all spaxels .    when the psf fwhm can be characterized to sufficient accuracy  .",
    "] ( within 10%  or 20% ; see section  [ section : simu ] ) , one can take its characteristics , together with the instrumental line - spread function ( lsf ) , into consideration and recover the intrinsic modeled galaxy parameters .",
    "the algorithm uses the spectral lsf and the spatial psf to generate a three - dimensional kernel whose characteristics are set for the given instrument ( or a user - generated instrument module ) .",
    "while a full deconvolution of hyperspectral cubes would be preferred , it is usually a challenge mathematically ( a new method has been proposed recently by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a forward convolution of a parametric model offers a very useful alternative .",
    "this forward convolution gives us the opportunity to estimate intrinsic modeled kinematic parameters in a wider range of seeing conditions , as illustrated in recent papers ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we need a parametric model , and we focus here on a galaxy disk model for emission - line surveys , but the algorithm is adaptable to other situations . in order to construct a modeled galaxy in the observational coordinate systems ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , we start by generating a three - dimensional galaxy model in a euclidian coordinate system ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath15 ) , where the @xmath15-axis is normal to the galaxy plane ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",

    "we adopt a gaussian luminosity distribution perpendicular to the plane , @xmath27 , defining @xmath26 as the characteristic thickness of the disk .",
    "galpak@xmath7   also allows the user to choose an exponential @xmath28 or a sech@xmath29 distribution @xmath30sech@xmath31 .",
    "we set the disk thickness to @xmath32 where @xmath22 is the disk half - light radius .",
    "this choice corresponds to @xmath33  kpc , typical of high - redshift edge - on / chain galaxies @xcite . at this stage",
    ", we have a disk model in euclidean coordinates that accounts for the flux distribution only .    for the gas kinematics , we create three kinematic cubes in the same spatial coordinate reference frame for the velocities @xmath34 assuming circular orbits .",
    "the rotational velocity @xmath35 with a maximum rotation velocity @xmath36 can have several functional forms : it can be an @xmath37 velocity profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an inverted exponential @xcite , or a hyperbolic @xmath38 profile ( e.g. * ? ?",

    "we stress that our parameter @xmath36 is _ not _ the projected asymptotic velocity , but is the true asymptotic velocity irrespective of the inclination .",
    "another option , called `` mass , '' assumes a constant light - to - mass ratio and sets @xmath35 from the enclosed light / mass @xmath43 profile @xmath44 where @xmath40 is the radius in the galaxy @xmath41 plane and @xmath36 normalizes the profile .",
    "this option has a rotation curve that peaks at some radius ( set by the half - light radius ) , decreases at larger radii , and is to be preferred for nuclear disks or when there is no significant dark matter component .",
    "we then rotate the disk model around two axes according to an inclination ( @xmath45 ) and position angle ( pa , anticlockwise from @xmath13 ) and create a cube in @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 using the three intermediate 2d maps : the flux map , the velocity field , and the dispersion map ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the flux map is obtained from the rotated flux cube summed along the wavelength axis .",
    "the velocity field is obtained from the flux - weighted mean @xmath47 velocity cube .",
    "the total ( line - of - sight ) velocity dispersion @xmath46 is obtained from the sum of three terms ( added in quadrature ) .",
    "it includes ( i ) the local isotropic velocity dispersion @xmath48 driven by the disk self - gravity , which is @xmath49 for a compact `` thick '' or large `` thin '' disk @xcite ; ( ii ) a mixing term , @xmath50 , arising from mixing the velocities along the line of sight for a geometrically thick disk , which is obtained from the flux - weighted variance of the cube @xmath47 , and ( iii ) an intrinsic dispersion ( @xmath51 ) which is assumed to be isotropic and constant spatially to account for the fact that high - redshift disks are dynamically hotter than the self - gravity expectation .",
    "indeed , this turbulence term @xmath51 is often observed to be @xmath5280   in @xmath4 disks @xcite and thus dominates the other two terms since the mixing term @xmath50 is typically @xmath5315 and the self - gravity term @xmath48 is typically 1030 .    to summarize",
    ", the flux profile can be chosen to be ` exponential ' ( @xmath54),`gaussian ' ( @xmath18 ) , and ` de vaucouleur ' ( @xmath55 ) ; the velocity profile @xmath35 can be arctan ( `` arctan '' ) , inverted exponential ( `` exponential '' ) , hyperbolic ( `` tanh '' ) or that of mass profile ( `` mass '' ) ; and the local dispersion can be that of the thin or thick disk .",
    "there are in total 10 free parameters   since the turnover radius @xmath42 is irrelevant . ] to be determined from the data .",
    "the 10 parameters are the @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 positions , the disk half - light radius @xmath22 , the total flux @xmath20 , the inclination @xmath45 , position angle pa , the turnover radius @xmath42 , the maximum circular velocity @xmath36 , and the one - dimensional intrinsic dispersion @xmath51 .",

    "these will serve as reference data sets .",
    "one could imagine that the s / n in the recovered parameters be a function of the average s / n pixel@xmath3 , or the apparent sb since the observed central sb scales directly with the snr in the central pixel .",

    "very compact objects ( compared to the beam or the psf ) have high sb by definition ( and high s / n pixel@xmath3 ) , but the morphology and/or kinematic information may be lost owing to the beam smearing .",
    "on the other hand , very extended objects have low surface brightness ( and low s / n pixel@xmath3 ) , but have many pixels in the outer regions ( with low s / n ) , where most of the information on the galaxy is located and not affected by the beam .    before illustrating this point",
    ", it is important to define commonly used terms such as the sb of galaxies . from any light profile @xmath16 such as given by equation  [ eq : ir ] , there are many ways to define galaxy sb , such as @xmath23 the sb at the effective radius @xmath19 , @xmath78 the intrinsic sb at the central pixel , @xmath79 the observed sb at the central pixel , and sb@xmath80 the average sb within the intrinsic half - light radius @xmath22 : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the galaxy total flux . a related quantity to equation  [ eq : sbconv ] is the observed sb , defined as : @xmath83 where @xmath82 is the galaxy total flux and @xmath84 the galaxy apparent area given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the observed major and minor semiaxes , respectively , of the galaxy .",
    "the relations between these various definitions are described in the appendix .",
    "to illustrate the point made at the beginning of this section , we show in figure  [ fig : sbplot](a ) the relative errors @xmath88 on some of the estimated parameters for our mock data cubes generated in section  [ section : simu ] as a function of central sb , sb@xmath89 ( defined in equation  [ eq : sbobs ] ) .",

    "the crosses , squares and circles represent the three subsamples with sizes @xmath53 2.5 , 5 , and 7.5  kpc , respectively .",
    "one sees that the errors in the morphological parameters ( size , pa , inclination ) do increase toward low sbs , but the threshold point at which the relative errors reach @xmath53100%  depends on the galaxy size , represented by the symbols .",
    "this illustrates the well - known fact that very extended objects have low surface brightness ( and low s / n pixel@xmath3 ) but have many pixels in the outer regions that contain useful information .    as argued at the beginning of this section and demonstrated in figure  [ fig : sbplot ] , sb alone might not be sufficient to determine the s / n in the fitted parameters , but the compactness of the galaxy with respect to the beam also plays an important role . in figure",
    "[ fig : sbplot](b ) , we show the relative error @xmath90 with respect to the observed sb@xmath91 times the size - to - psf ratio @xmath92 .",
    "the symbols correspond to galaxy subsamples with various sizes as in figure  [ fig : sbplot](a ) .",
    "the index @xmath93 was found to be empirically @xmath94 in order to have the relative errors for each of the subsamples follow a similar trend and may differ sightly for each of the parameters @xmath95 .",
    "in fact , we find that @xmath93 is approximately 0.8 , 1.2 , and 1.4 for the size , pa , and inclination parameter , respectively .    these empirical results can be explained by the following arguments .",
    "the apparent sb within the half - light radius sb@xmath96 ( equation  [ eq : sbconv ] ) and the observed sb@xmath91 ( equation  [ eq : sbobs ] ) are proportional to the sb ( or s / n ) of the central pixel , @xmath79 , as shown in the appendix ( equation  [ eq : appendix ] ) . in the case of no psf convolution",
    ", @xcite showed that ( their equation 12 ) the relative error @xmath97 on morphological parameters ( its major - axis @xmath86 ) scales inversely to the central @xmath78 where @xmath78 is the intrinsic central sb ( equation  [ eq : io : exp][eq : io : gau ] ) . in the presence of a psf convolution , equation  16 of @xcite which",
    "applies here shows that the relative errors on the major - axis @xmath86 scale as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the radius of the psf ( @xmath100 fwhm/2 ) and @xmath22 the intrinsic half - light radius .    in our cases , for high - redshift galaxies ,",
    "the ratio @xmath101 is @xmath102 and after performing a taylor expansion around @xmath103 with @xmath104 and @xmath105 , one finds that the factor @xmath106 is approximately @xmath107 .",
    "hence , equation  [ eq : errorp ] on the errors in the major - axis @xmath86 becomes in the regime where @xmath108 : @xmath109 which shows that the quality of the estimated morphological parameters will depend on both the pixel s / n ( or sb ) and the galaxy compactness with respect to the beam , @xmath110 , as shown in figure  [ fig : sbplot](b )    in both figure  [ fig : sbplot](a ) and  [ fig : sbplot](b ) , the gray solid lines show the expected behavior for the morphological parameters ( equation  [ eq : refregier ] ) and one sees that they agree better with the mock data in the right panels for the morphological parameters .",
    "this shows that the @xcite formalism describes the relative errors on the morphological parameters ( size , pa , and inclination ) relatively well , as a first approximation .",
    "we note that equation  [ eq : refregier ] is only an approximation to equation  [ eq : errorp ] when @xmath111 and that there might be other dependencies for the other morphological parameters , namely , for the pa and for the inclination . here",
    "we refer the reader to table  1 of @xcite and their appendix for further details ; it is beyond the scope of this paper to present a full 3d derivation of the @xcite formalism .",
    "contrary to the morphological parameters , the errors in the kinematic parameter @xmath36 show strong positive ( negative ) biases in the smallest ( largest ) mock galaxies , represented by the crosses ( circles ) respectively in the top panel of figure  [ fig : sbplot](b ) .",
    "the positive bias for for the most compact galaxies ( crosses ) with respect to the beam can be understood because the @xmath36 information is located mostly in the outer parts of the galaxy , where the s / n is too low .",
    "the negative bias for the largest galaxies ( 1 \" in @xmath22 ) at low sb is likely due to the spatial cut of our mock cubes being too small .",
    "we will return to the reliability of @xmath36 in section  [ section : vmax ] and now turn to a more detailed discussion on the reliability of the parameters ( size , inclination , disk velocity dispersion , and @xmath36 ) . while we used an arctan rotation curve",
    ", we note that the following results were found to be identical when we used an ` exponential ' rotation curve .",
    "we have shown in the previous section with figure  [ fig : sbplot ] that the relative errors on the half - light radius follow appoximately the expectation from the @xcite formalism . here",
    "we investigate whether the relative errors depend on some of the other parameters , such as inclination , seeing , and size .",
    "figure  [ fig : matrix_size ] shows the relative errors @xmath112 for several key parameters @xmath95 .",
    "the bottom ( top ) row shows the result for the size parameters @xmath22 ( inclination @xmath45 ) , respectively , as a function of seeing , redshift , inclination , and size - to - psf ratio @xmath113 .",
    "the black curves with increasing thickness correspond to subsamples with different sb levels ( labeled ) where the zero point ( dotted line ) has been offset for clarity purposes .",
    "the data points represent the median , and the size of the error bars represent the standard deviation for each of the subsamples , where we have typically @xmath114 mock cubes per bin .",
    "we note that the median standard deviations on the parameters ( from the posterior distributions ) tend to be within 20%  of these binned standard deviations .    from this figure",
    ", one sees that the galpak@xmath7  algorithm recovers the intrinsic half - light radius @xmath22 irrespectively of seeing , redshift , and/or intrinsic size .",
    "note that the relative errors with respect to size - to - seeing ratio at a fixed sb follow roughly the expectation from equation  [ eq : errorp ] , where the factor @xmath115 saturates to unity in our regime with @xmath113 @xmath94 to 2.5 .",
    "these results are not affected by the choice of the sb profile ( sersic @xmath25 ) . and a more accurate determination of the intrinsic half - light radius ( @xmath22 ) . ]    from the top row in figure  [ fig : matrix_size ] , one sees that the input inclination is recovered except at the two smallest fluxes and for the more face - on cases .",
    "the reason that the algorithm can recover the inclination well is that the algorithm breaks the traditional degeneracy between @xmath36 and @xmath45 using the sb profile ( i.e. the axis ratio @xmath116 ) whereas traditional methods fitting the kinematics on velocity fields have a strong degeneracy between @xmath36 and the inclination @xmath45 .",

    "given the instrumental resolution of muse used here ( @xmath118  km / s ) , small dispersions are more difficult to recover .",
    "we note that the local dispersion is rather sensitive to the instrument lsf fwhm , as one might expect .",
    "the user can specify more than one type of lsf ( gaussian or moffat ) , and a user - provided vector can be specified if the parametric lsf is not sufficient to describe the instrument lsf .",
    "one could argue that our results are driven by the fact that we use the exact same psf ( in 3d ) as the one used to generate these modeled galaxies . to test the reliability of the algorithm in more realistic situations , when the psf fwhm is not known accurately , we ran the algorithm on the same set of data cubes with a random component added to the fwhm of the psf given by a normal distribution with @xmath119 , corresponding to uncertainties in the fwhm of @xmath120% .",
    "we found that the accuracy of the spatial kernel ( psf ) has little impact on the recovered parameters . on the other hand , we find that the shape of the psf is more critical especially for the morphological parameter such as the axis ratio @xmath116 ( or the inclination ) .",

    "shows that the accuracy on the recovered parameters depends on the product of the central sb , sb@xmath91 times the size - to - seeing ratio @xmath153 , following approximately the analytical expectation of @xcite ; 3 .   from this set of mock data cubes ,",
    "the morphological parameters do not depend on seeing , redshift , or the size - to - seeing ratio ( figure  [ fig : matrix_size ] ) ; 4 .   from this set of mock data cubes ,",
    "the robustness of the algorithm in recovering the kinematics parameters is also independent of seeing and redshift , provided that the ratio between the galaxy half - light radius and the psf radius @xmath154 is larger than 1.5 ( figure  [ fig : matrix_vmax ] ) ; 5 .",
    "we also find that the accuracy in the recovered parameters does not depend on the fwhm accuracy , but depends more critically on the shape of the psf , except for the disk dispersion @xmath51 , which depends critically on the instrument lsf ; 6 .   using a simulated disk galaxy from the hydro - simulation of michel - dansec et al . ,",
    "which contains asymmetric deviations , we found that the kinematic parameters can be well estimated irrespectively of seeing , provided that the snr is above a critical value ( 3 in this case ; figure  [ fig : global ] ) .",
    "consequently , when the psf fwhm is slightly above the original scientific goal ( 10 instead of 08 ) the optimal strategy is to integrate 30%  longer ( equation  [ eq : snr ] ) for a galaxy of size @xmath150 .    in conclusion , the galpak@xmath7  algorithm can provide reliable constraints on galaxy size , inclination , and kinematics over a wide range of seeing and of s / n .",
    "however , the algorithm should not be used blindly , and we stress that users of galpak@xmath7  are strongly advised ( 1 ) to look at the convergence of the parameters ( as in figure  [ fig : mcmc ] ) ; ( 2 ) to investigate possible covariance in the parameters ( as in figure  [ fig : correl ] ) , as these are rather data specific ; and ( 3 ) to adjust the mcmc algorithm to ensure an acceptance rate between 30%  and 50% , as discussed in the online documentation  .",
    "recent applications of the galpak@xmath7  algorithm can be found in @xcite , and @xcite , which illustrate the potential in using a global 3d fitting technique .",
