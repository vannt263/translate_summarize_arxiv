    "warm inflation is known as the scenario of dissipative inflaton motion@xcite . in this paper",
    "we address the generic situation where the inflaton field , which couples to a massive trigger field , dissipates its energy into light fields during inflation * without * introducing additional interactions .",
    "namely , a trigger field @xmath1 coupled to the inflaton @xmath2 with the interaction @xmath3 obtains large mass @xmath4 during inflation , and decays ( at least gravitationally ) into light matter with a decay rate @xmath5 the condition for fast decay ( @xmath6 ) is trivial .",
    "we define the critical value @xmath7 by @xmath8 and find that the decay into light matter ( @xmath9 ) is efficient for @xmath10 . for a more concrete argument , we consider the hybrid - type potential with the superpotential @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the inflaton , and @xmath13 are a pair of charged fields ( trigger fields ) that are responsible for reheating after inflation . for the region @xmath14",
    ", we consider the typical flat potential @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are dimensionless parameters and @xmath18 is an integer greater than 4 . the first term @xmath19 denotes the inflaton potential caused by the trigger field , which is displaced from the true minimum to the origin .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath17 originate from the typical supergravity action . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the trigger field @xmath1 , the typical interaction given by @xmath20 and the decay rate @xmath21 .",
    "since the decay into light matter ( @xmath9 ) is effective during @xmath10 , the dissipative coefficient of the inflaton , which is mediated by the heavy trigger field @xmath1 , is given by@xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is assumed .",
    ", the dissipative coefficient is given by @xmath24@xcite . ] the strength of the damping is measured by @xmath25 , given by the dissipative coefficient and the hubble parameter : @xmath26 which can be used to rewrite the field equation of the dissipating field as @xmath27 for the dissipation caused by gravitational decay , the ratio is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a dimensionless constant .. namely , we do not consider a situation with many light matter fields , which may enhance the decay rate by a factor of @xmath30 , where @xmath18 is the number of light fields",
    ". the planck - scale suppression can be relaxed if the cut - off scale appears below @xmath31 .",
    "these effects may lead to a very large @xmath32 . ]",
    "note that for the modest values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , strong dissipation is not possible if the hubble parameter is large ( @xmath35 ) during inflation .",
    "we thus implicitly assume inflation of the scale @xmath36 .",
    "from the above equations , we find that strong dissipation defined by @xmath37 is possible due to gravitational decay @xmath38 . for @xmath34",
    ", the condition @xmath37 leads to a strong dissipative regime given by @xmath39 thermalization of the decay product , which is very important in warm inflation , is not always important in solving the @xmath0 problem .",
    "namely , if the dissipative coefficient is calculated in the zero - temperature limit , the dissipation may occur without thermalization , although inflation is not warm in that case .",
    "if the dissipation is strong for the gravitational decay , we do not need to introduce either additional symmetry that forbids a @xmath40 mass or an artificial interaction that leads to very efficient decay of the trigger field . to examine more explicitly the slow - roll conditions of dissipative inflaton",
    ", we introduce new slow - roll parameters for the motion , different from the conventional slow - roll parameters .",
    "they are given by @xmath41 where the usual slow - roll parameters ( @xmath42 and @xmath0 ) are defined by @xmath43 here the subscript denotes the derivative with respect to the field . for warm evolution",
    "the third slow - roll parameter can be defined as @xmath44 which sometimes raises a trivial condition , depending on the model .",
    "calculating the slow - roll parameter is straightforward . if the inflaton is far from the origin , terms proportional to @xmath45 dominate the potential . then , using @xmath46 during inflation , the slow - roll parameters are given by @xmath47 the condition @xmath48 leads to @xmath49 and the second condition @xmath50 leads to @xmath51 the simplest example is @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which leads to dissipative slow - roll during @xmath54 .",
    "we show a schematic picture in figure 1 . introducing @xmath55 defined by @xmath56",
    "we find that the above conditions are not applicable for @xmath57 , since in this region the quadratic term is more important than the higher dimensional terms . for @xmath58 ,",
    "the slow - roll conditions are given by @xmath59 which lead to @xmath60 we thus find that strong dissipation is indeed possible for @xmath57 .",
    "however , in contrast to standard hybrid inflation , the slow - roll does not end with the waterfall at @xmath61 .",
    "we thus find that slow - roll inflation is possible for gravitational dissipation , but the parameter space for the slow - rolling is not trivial , depending on the model .",
    "we show a schematic picture for a successful scenario in figure 1 .",
    "the distinguishing property of this scenario is the appearance of @xmath62 that defines the end of dissipative slow - roll inflation .",
    "note that in the usual hybrid - type inflation model , the end of inflation is defined by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 becomes unstable . in the present model , in contrast to non - dissipative inflation ,",
    "the dissipative slow - roll ends at @xmath65 , where the dissipative slow - roll parameter reaches unity .",
    "the inflaton motion is fast during @xmath66 , which occurs just before reheating at @xmath61 .",
    "( 200,210)(110,330 )    [ fig : perspective ]",
    "in the above argument , we considered the @xmath0-problem in supersymmetric inflation with the typical hybrid - type potential , and showed that dissipative slow - roll is possible .",
    "this solves the traditional @xmath0 problem , though it is still not certain if the usual curvature perturbations created at the horizon exit meet the requirements of the primordial cosmological perturbations .",
    "in fact , the cobe normalization leads to@xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the possible correction from the background radiation .",
    "of course , @xmath69 if there is no significant radiation background coupled to the inflaton . here",
    "we have introduced a new parameter defined by @xmath70 .",
    "the source of the radiation is not specified here . from the langevin equation ,",
    "the root - mean square fluctuation amplitude of the inflaton field @xmath71 after the freeze out is obtained to be @xmath72 in the above argument , we assumed @xmath73 .",
    "for @xmath74 , if the slow - roll conditions are satisfied , the cobe normalization leads to @xmath75 these results depend crucially on the model .",
    "notably , we can not specify the temperature of the background radiation for the supersymmetric inflation model , since there are many directions in supersymmetric theory , which may dissipate and source the background@xcite , even though they are not the inflaton .",
    "the above curvature perturbations , which are calculated using the standard perturbations created at the horizon crossing , may not meet the cosmological requirements .",
    "however , the mismatch does not mean that there is a crucial difficulty in the scenario .",
    "namely , alternative scenarios for the curvature perturbations may be important for the model , as there are typically many flat directions in the supersymmetric inflation model .",
    "we thus consider in the next subsection an alternative for the generation of the curvature perturbations , which works specifically in the dissipative scenario .",
    "other possibilities , such as inhomogeneous scenarios of phase transition@xcite , ( p)reheating@xcite or curvatons@xcite are not discussed in this paper , because they are not characteristic of dissipative inflation .",
    "see ref.@xcite for more applications of the warm - flat directions .",
    "the inflaton potential and the interactions during inflation may be inhomogeneous due to entropy perturbations related to light fields such as moduli or flat directions in the supersymmetric model@xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneities in the potential or in the interactions may lead to inhomogeneous couplings or masses that may cause fluctuations of the inflaton velocity .",
    "this is the basic idea of modulated inflation@xcite .",
    "a similar situation may lead to the inhomogeneous end of hybrid inflation , as has been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , in the present scenario the inflaton velocity at the end of inflation is rapid ( i.e. , @xmath76 or @xmath77 at the end of inflation ) and the perturbations caused by the end - boundary are less significant than the typical cosmological perturbations . on the other hand and contrary to the conventional ( cold ) hybrid model",
    ", the perturbations caused by the modulated inflaton velocity ( @xmath78 ) can be significant in the dissipative inflation model . in this section",
    ", we examine the scenario of modulated inflation in the dissipative inflation model .    for a typical example",
    ", we consider the @xmath79-dependence of the dissipative coefficient @xmath80 ^ 3 $ ] and the corrections suppressed by the cut - off scale : @xmath81 where @xmath79 is a light field that may be warm during inflation@xcite .",
    "it is possible to assume a hierarchy between the cut - off scale @xmath82 and the planck scale ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "note that in the usual cold model , in which the dissipation is negligible and @xmath64 during inflation , @xmath84 can not cause fluctuations of the inflaton velocity .",
    "in contrast to the cold model , in the dissipative inflation model @xmath85 caused by @xmath84 can lead to significant inhomogeneities in the inflaton velocity .",
    "inhomogeneous dissipation ( @xmath85 ) creates curvature perturbations given by@xcite @xmath86 here the flat direction @xmath79 may obtain @xmath40 mass from the supergravity , but it still can move slowly if the dissipation is significant for the flat direction@xcite .",
    "also , for the warm - flat direction @xmath79 , the amplitude of the perturbation is given by @xmath87 which shows that the amplitude is characterized by its interaction .",
    "here we considered strong dissipation @xmath88 for the light field @xmath79 .",
    "the amplitude of the warm direction is always larger than the amplitude of the cold - flat direction .",
    "the source of the background radiation is not specified , since many directions in the supersymmetric theory may dissipate during inflation and contribute to the background radiation .",
    "the spectral index of the curvature perturbation is usually determined by the potential and the interaction of the light field @xmath79 , but for dissipative inflation it may also depend on the background radiation which may be sourced from the other flat directions .",
    "in this paper we considered a dissipative inflation model for conventional supergravity using the typical hybrid - type potential .",
    "if there is no symmetry that forbids hubble - induced mass , the inflaton mass will be as large as the hubble scale during inflation .",
    "this is the famous @xmath0 problem of the supergravity inflation model .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to find a natural solution to the problem without introducing symmetries or artificial interactions that may ruin the simplicity of the original hybrid inflation . in order to solve the problem within the naive setup",
    ", we considered only the gravitational decay mode ( the gravitational decay of the trigger field into light matter ) and find that the dissipation of the inflaton may be large and can dominate the friction of the inflaton motion .",
    "then we showed that dissipative damping can provide a solution to the traditional @xmath0 problem .",
    "the dissipative inflation scenario is of course not the same as the cold scenario .",
    "a significant discrepancy that characterizes the dissipative scenario is the way the inflation ends . in the usual cold model , inflation ends with the so - called `` waterfall '' of the trigger field at @xmath61 , while in the dissipative model slow - roll ends before the waterfall .",
    "the differences in the dynamics of the inflaton motion lead to differences in the inflationary scenario , especially for the generation of curvature perturbations .",
    "considering the perturbations of the dissipative coefficient , we found that modulated inflation can create significant curvature perturbations .",
