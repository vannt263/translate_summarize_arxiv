    "the microscopic cluster model is one of the successful models to study the structure and reactions of light nuclei @xcite . in the conventional cluster model",
    ", one assumes that the nucleus is composed of several simple clusters with @xmath11 which are described by ( 0@xmath5 ) harmonic - oscillator shell model functions , and use an effective @xmath12-@xmath12 interaction which is appropriate for such a model space .",
    "however , it is well known that the ground states of the typical clusters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath8 and @xmath10he have non - negligible admixtures of @xmath13-wave component due to the tensor interaction . since the conventional cluster model does not directly treat the @xmath13-wave component , the strong attraction of the nucleon - nucleon interaction due to the tensor term",
    "is assumed to be renormalized into the central term of the effective interaction .",
    "recently , @xmath0-@xmath1 structure calculations @xcite have been successfully developed : stochastic variational method ( svm ) @xcite , global vector representation method ( gvr ) @xcite , green s function monte carlo method @xcite , no core shell model @xcite , correlated hyperspherical harmonics method @xcite , unitary correlation operator method @xcite , and so on .",
    "although the application of @xmath0-@xmath1 reaction calculations with a realistic interaction are restricted so much in comparison with structure calculations , it has been intensively applied to the four - nucleon systems @xmath3+@xmath9 and @xmath8+@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "especially @xmath2+@xmath2 scattering states , which couple to @xmath3+@xmath4 and @xmath8+@xmath9 channels , have attracted much attention , because the @xmath2+@xmath2 radiative capture is one of the mechanisms making @xmath10he through electro - magnetic transitions @xcite and also have posed intriguing puzzles for analyzing powers @xcite , which are motivated by the famous @xmath14 problem in the three - nucleon system .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath2+@xmath2 elastic - scattering phase shifts are interesting because the astrophysical s - factor of the @xmath2(@xmath2,@xmath15)@xmath10he reaction is not explained by any calculation using an effective interaction that contains no tensor term , and is expected to be contributed by the @xmath13-wave components of the clusters through @xmath16 transitions @xcite .",
    "also , thanks to recent developments of the microscopic cluster model , the simple model using the ( 0@xmath5 ) harmonic - oscillator wave function with an effective interaction is not mandatory any more , at least , in light nuclei .",
    "we can use a kind of @xmath0-@xmath1 cluster model which employs more realistic cluster wave functions with realistic interactions .",

    "the problem is how to calculate the matrix elements . in this paper , we develop a method called the triple global vector representation method ( tgvr ) , by which we calculate the matrix elements in a unified way .",
    "although we restricted ourselves to four nucleon systems in the present paper , the formulation of the tgvr itself can be applied to more than four - body systems as in the previous studies of the global vector representation methods ( gvr ) @xcite . furthermore , for scattering problems , the tgvr can deal with more complicated systems than the double ( or single ) global vector which was given in the previous papers @xcite , because we need three representative orbital angular momenta , the total internal orbital momenta of both clusters and the orbital momentum of their relative motion , in order to reasonably describe the scattering states . in other words",
    ", the first global vector represents the angular momentum of cluster @xmath18 , the second global vector represents the angular momentum of cluster @xmath19 , and the third global vector represents the relative angular momentum between the clusters .    in this paper , we will investigate the effect of the distortion of clusters on the @xmath2+@xmath2 elastic - scattering by comparing the phase shifts calculated with a realistic and an effective interaction . in section 2",

    "the phase shift behavior of the realistic and effective potentials are very similar , and the coupling between the @xmath116+@xmath116 and @xmath117+@xmath12 channels can be neglected or is very small . furthermore , the tensor interaction makes the energy splitting of the @xmath177 , @xmath181 and @xmath188 negative parity states of @xmath10he consistent with experiment .",

    "it is needless to say that @xmath0-@xmath1 reaction calculations are very important to understand the underlying reaction dynamics involving continuum states .",
    "simpler calculations using effective interactions in the same framework , as carried out in the present paper , are also meaningful because we can understand more clearly the effect of the tensor force by comparing both calculations .",

    "<S> elastic - scattering phase shifts for four - nucleon systems are studied in an @xmath0-@xmath1 type cluster model in order to clarify the role of the tensor force and to investigate cluster distortions in low energy @xmath2+@xmath2 and @xmath3+@xmath4 scattering . in the present method , </S>",
    "<S> the description of the cluster wave function is extended from a simple ( 0@xmath5 ) harmonic - oscillator shell model to a few - body model with a realistic interaction , in which the wave function of the subsystems are determined with the stochastic variational method . in order to calculate the matrix elements of the four - body system , </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a triple global vector representation method for the correlated gaussian basis functions . to compare effects of the cluster distortion with realistic and effective interactions , </S>",
    "<S> we employ the av8@xmath6 potential as a realistic interaction and the minnesota potential as an effective interaction . especially for @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> the calculated phase shifts show that the @xmath3+@xmath4 and @xmath8+@xmath9 channels are strongly coupled to the @xmath2+@xmath2 channel for the case of the realistic interaction . on the contrary , the coupling of these channels plays a relatively minor role for the case of the effective interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this difference between both potentials originates from the tensor term in the realistic interaction . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the tensor interaction makes the energy splitting of the negative parity states of @xmath10he consistent with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> no such splitting is however reproduced with the effective interaction . </S>"
