    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are observed in various bands from radio to gamma - ray .",
    "x - ray observations provide the evidence that electrons are accelerated to highly relativistic energies in snr shocks @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is believed that ions are also accelerated to the `` knee '' ( @xmath2 ev ) of the galactic cosmic ray spectrum as the origin of galactic cosmic rays .",
    "x - ray observations of snrs also suggest the magnetic field amplification up to @xmath3 in the vicinity of the collisionless shock front @xcite . theoretically , several mechanisms for magnetic field amplification have been proposed , one of which is the cosmic ray driven instability , whereby cosmic rays diffuse to the upstream region where the resonant and the nonresonant instabilities become unstable and cause fluctuations in the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "recently , the nonresonant instability has been investigated with particle in cell simulations @xcite and mhd simulations @xcite , but @xcite claim that the periodic boundary simulations can not describe nonlinear features .",
    "thus , the amplitude and the wave spectrum of the magnetic fields excited by the nonresonant instability in the downstream region are open issues .",
    "the other magnetic field amplification mechanism is fluid type instabilities in the downstream region @xcite .",
    "these instabilities generate waves with longer wavelength than plasma kinetic instabilities .    in this letter ,",
    "we propose yet another mechanism of the magnetic field amplification , where neutral particles in the partially - ionized interstellar matter ( ism ) play a significant role .",
    "the existence of neutral particles has been identified in many young snrs from the detection of h@xmath0 emissions .",
    "since snr shocks are collisionless , neutral particles can penetrate the shock front freely without deceleration . as a result",
    ", a significant relative velocity exists between the plasma particles and neutral particles in the shock downstream region , which is given by @xmath4=@xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the shock velocity ) . through",
    "the charge exchange process in the downstream region , shocked hot protons and cold neutral hydrogen atoms are converted to hot neutral hydrogen atoms and cold protons , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is noted that the h@xmath0 emissions from snr consist of two components with narrow and wide line widths @xcite .",
    "the narrow - width component originates from cold hydrogen atoms ( before charge exhange ) excited by heated proton and electron collisions , while the latter wide - width component originates from hot hydrogen atoms produced by the charge exchange process .    the neutral fraction of the ism around supernovae is often found to be order of unity .",
    "for example , @xcite have shown that the neutral fractions are about 0.8 and 0.1 in tycho and sn1006 environments .",
    "therefore , the charge - exchanged cold protons can have energy density comparable to that of the hot shocked protons , so that their effects on the downstream physical condition should be quite important .",
    "such a condition is similar to interacting region between the solar wind and a comet or interstellar neutral particles where several collisionless plasma instabilities have been considered @xcite .",
    "we first provide the background plasma condition (  2 ) .",
    "we then perform linear analyses of the collisionless plasma instabilities for a parallel shock (  3 ) and discuss impacts on the magnetic field amplification , the shock structure and the particle acceleration (  4 ) .",
    "studies of the perpendicular or oblique shocks will be presented in another paper .",
    "although collisionless shock structures have not been understood completely , the dissipation scale is thought to be about the ion gyroradius , @xmath7 cm , which is much shorter than the ionization scale , @xmath8 cm @xcite .",
    "therefore the charge exchange process occurs after the upstream plasma density is compressed according to the rankin - hugoniot relation .",
    "interestingly , this ionization scale is comparable to the spatial scale of x - ray filaments @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we treat only the parallel shock , so that the magnetic field of ism @xmath9 is not compressed . for the particle components in the downstream region",
    ", we consider neutral hydrogen atoms ( density @xmath10 ) , shocked hot protons ( @xmath11 ) and electrons ( @xmath12 ) , and charge - exchanged cold protons ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we choose typical values for young snrs as , @xmath14 and set @xmath15 . the density of cold protons @xmath13 becomes higher as the neutral hydrogens flow to the downstream , and is a function of the elapsed time after passing over the shock front , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the cross section of charge exchange between the hydrogen atom and shocked proton .",
    "we set @xmath18 as a typical value , so that the charge exchange time @xmath19",
    ". from equation ( 2 ) , we have @xmath20 where we set @xmath10 to be constant at @xmath21 , the atomic hydrogen density in the ism .",
    "this approximation holds as long as @xmath22 . to satisfy the current neutrality , in the downstream electron plasma rest frame , drift velocities of two component of protons are @xmath23 the temperatures are @xmath24 where we assume the downstream electron and proton temperature ratio @xmath25 as the typical value of young snrs @xcite .",
    "in this section , we perform linear analysis by treating @xmath26 as a free parameter . we consider only the cases where the wave vector @xmath27 is purely parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field . to obtain the maximum growth rate of the instabilities as a function of @xmath28 ,",
    "we solve numerically the standard collsionless plasma dispersion relation with the drift velocity and the thermal velocity @xcite because the thermal effect is important in the downstream region .      for parallel propagation",
    ", there are three unstable modes .",
    "one is the ion acoustic instability which is an electrostatic mode .",
    "the dispersion relation is given by @xmath30 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & z(\\xi_s ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi } } \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{e^{-z^2}}{z-\\xi_s}dz , \\\\ & & \\xi_s = \\frac{\\omega - kv_{{\\rm d},s}}{kv_{{\\rm th},s } } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath31 represents particle species , here electron , hot proton , and cold proton , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the corresponding plasma frequency , drift velocity and thermal velocity , respectively , and @xmath34 is the plasma dispersion function .",
    "the others are the resonant and the nonresonant instabilies which are electromagnetic modes and can amplify the fluctuating magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relation for right handed electromagnetic waves is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the corresponding plasma cyclotron frequency ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the resonant instability satisfies the condition @xmath38 -kv_{\\rm d , cold}+\\omega_{\\rm c , p}=0 $ ] , so that the propagating direction is the same as the drift velocity of cold protons . on the other hand , the nonresonant instability does not satisfy the resonance condition and the propagating direction is opposite to that of the resonant mode .      for perpendicular propagation",
    ", the weibel instability with the uniform magnetic field is excited . in this condition ,",
    "the unstable mode is the ordinary mode , that is , the fluctuating electric field is parallel to the magnetic field , so that the dispersion relation is given by @xmath40\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}i_n(\\lambda_s)e^{-\\lambda_s}\\frac{n^2\\omega_{{\\rm c},s}^2}{\\omega^2-n^2\\omega_{{\\rm c},s}^2 } \\\\ & & \\lambda_{s}=\\frac{kv_{{\\rm th},s}}{\\omega_{{\\rm c},s } } \\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the modified bessel function of the first kind with order @xmath42 .      substituting equations ( 1 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) to the dispersion relations ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 8)",
    ", we obtain the growth rates of these instabilities .",
    "figure 1 shows the maximum growth rates of these instabilities as a function of @xmath28 , where the growth rates are normalized by @xmath43 .",
    "note that even if @xmath28 is large , the growth rate of the nonresonant instability is smaller than that of the resonant instability because the thermal velocity of the downstream plasma is comparable to the relative velocity @xmath5 .",
    "the weibel instability is stabilized when its growth rate becomes smaller than the proton cyclotron frequency because the plasma motion is controlled by the uniform magnetic field . in our plasma condition ,",
    "the weibel instability is stabilized when @xmath28 is smaller than about @xmath44 .",
    "this critical density depends on thermal velocities , the uniform magnetic field and the drift velocities .    to find which instability becomes nonlinear first after the shock passage",
    ", we compare the growth rate of the instabilities with the growth rate of the cold proton density @xmath45 . from equation ( 3 ) , we plot @xmath46 as a function of @xmath28 in figure 1 .",
    "the black solid and dashed lines show the case of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . the black solid line and the growth rate of the resonant instability cross at @xmath49 , so that first of all the resonant instability becomes nonlinear after passing over the shock front at around 50 times the proton cyclotron time .",
    "if the number density of hydrogen atoms in ism @xmath21 is @xmath50 as observed in high density clumps in ism @xcite , it is not the resonant instability but the weibel instability that first reaches the nonlinear phase .",
    "even when @xmath21 is as high as @xmath48 , the collision frequency with neutral particles is about @xmath51 @xcite which is much smaller than the growth rates , so that the collisional damping by the neutral particles is not important .",
    "depending on the ism density , either of the resonant or the weibel instability works to amplify the magnetic field .",
    "if this is the case , the high magnetic field intensity found in some snrs is explicable .",
    "although figure 1 shows that the ion acoustic instability is the most unstable mode when @xmath52 , in fact it is not because cold protons have already been slightly heated by the waves excited by the resonant or the weibel instabillity before @xmath28 attains such a value .",
    "for example , when @xmath28 becomes 0.1 , if the temperature of cold protons becomes larger than about 50 times the initial temperature , the growth rate of the weibel instability becomes larger than that of the ion acoustic instability . even during such a large temperature increase of the cold protons ,",
    "the kinetic energy of neutral atoms is almost conserved , so that its further conversion to the magnetic field energy remains possible .",
    "we performed linear analyses of collisionless plasma instabilities caused by cold proton beam generated by charge exchange process .",
    "we show that the resonant instability or the weibel instability becomes nonlinear after passing over the shock front and the cold beam carries a large kinetic energy . for the estimation of the magnetic field amplified by the instabilities",
    ", we can use a simple order - of - magnitude estimation based on the simulations by @xcite , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is energy conversion parameter from the kinetic energy to the magnetic energy .",
    "equation ( 9 ) is close to the suggestion by the x - ray observations . to make further discussion , however , we need more realistic simulations in which charge exchange process is properly taken into account .    next , we discuss the modification of shock structure by the existence of neutral atoms .",
    "neutral atoms of ism can penetrate the shock front without the dissipation and the deceleration . although we do not know how the mixing occurs after ionization , we speculate that eventually cold ions and hot ions have the same drift velocity which is one of the center of mass and that the relaxation scale is the ionizing scale . in this case",
    ", the far downstream velocity in the shock rest frame @xmath55 is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the ionization fraction of ism .",
    "hence , the spectral index of radio synchrotron from accelerated electrons @xmath0 is @xmath58 where the acceleration mechanism is the diffusive shock acceleration so that @xmath0 depends on the velocity ratio @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath60 , @xmath61 , it can explain the observed radio spectrum slightly steeper than the simplest prediction of @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "finally we mention the case where an snr is in a hot wind bubble with a lower density n @xmath63 and a higher temperature t @xmath64 ev .",
    "the growth rate of the resonant instability depends on @xmath28 and @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the growth rate of the weibel instability depends on @xmath65 and decreases rapidly when the growth rate is comparable to @xmath43 .",
    "hence , for lower upstream density , the growth rate of the resonant instability does not change from that of figure 1 , but the growth rate of the weibel instability becomes smaller than that of figure 1 .",
    "a higher temperature does not affect much the growth rates because the proton thermal velocity is much smaller than the relative velocity between cold and hot protons .",
    "thus , the mechanism proposed in this letter works as long as the neutral fraction of ism is as high as @xmath66 .",
