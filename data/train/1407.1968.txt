    "the eulerian polynomials @xmath3 , which enumerate the number of descents of a ( finite ) coxeter group @xmath4 , is one of the classical polynomials in combinatorics . during their long history ,",
    "they arised often in combinatorics and were extensively studied ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . in recent years , there has been a considerable amount of interesting extensions and modifications devoted to these polynomials ( see  @xcite for instance ) .",
    "in fact , brenti showed that it is enough to study the eulerian polynomials for irreducible coxeter groups  @xcite .",
    "for coxeter groups of type @xmath5 , it is known that these polynomials coincide with the classical eulerian polynomials , whose properties have been well studied from a combinatorial point of view  @xcite .",
    "some properties of the classical eulerian polynomials can be generalized to the eulerian polynomials of type @xmath6 , such as recurrence relations , the reality of zeros , generating functions , unimodality and total positivity properties  @xcite . in this paper , using their exponential generating functions , we present the strong @xmath0-log - convexity of many eulerian polynomials of coxeter groups , which on one hand also generalizes the strong @xmath0-log - convexity of the classical eulerian polynomials  @xcite , on the other hand will give the strong @xmath0-log - convexity of types @xmath1 , their @xmath0-analogues and the generalized eulerian polynomials associated to the arithmetic progression @xmath2 in a unified manner .",
    "let @xmath0 be an indeterminate .",
    "for two real polynomials @xmath7 and @xmath8 , denote @xmath9 if the difference @xmath10 has only nonnegative coefficients as a polynomial of @xmath0 .",
    "we say that a real polynomial sequence @xmath11 is called _ @xmath0-log - convex _ if @xmath12 for @xmath13 , and it is _ strongly @xmath0-log - convex _ if @xmath14 for all @xmath15 .",
    "clearly , the strong @xmath0-log - convexity of polynomials sequences implies the @xmath0-log - convexity .",
    "however , the converse dose not follows .    as we know that many famous polynomials sequences , such as the bell polynomials  @xcite , the classical eulerian polynomials  @xcite , the narayana polynomials  @xcite , the narayana polynomials of type @xmath16  @xcite and the jacobi - stirling numbers  @xcite , are @xmath0-log - convex . furthermore , almost all of these polynomials sequences are strongly @xmath0-log - convex  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we give the strong @xmath0-log - convexity of many eulerian polynomials .",
    "our proof relies on the theory of exponential riordan arrays and a criterion of zhu  @xcite for determining the strong @xmath0-log - convexity of polynomials sequences , whose generating functions can be given by the continued fraction .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , using the theory of exponential riordan arrays and orthogonal polynomials , we first give the continued fraction of the ordinary generating function of the polynomials sequence , whose exponential generating function generalizes the exponential generating function of many eulerian polynomials . then we obtain the strong @xmath0-log - convexity of the polynomials sequence using the continued fraction and a criterion of zhu  @xcite . as applications",

    "finally , in the appendix , we can obtain a quick introduction to the exponential riordan arrays and the orthogonal polynomials used in this paper .",
    "in this section , we first give the continued fraction of the ordinary generating function of the polynomials sequence @xmath17 , whose exponential generating function generalizes the exponential generating functions of many eulerian polynomials . then using the continued fraction and a criterion of zhu  @xcite",

    "[ eo ] suppose that the exponential generating function of the polynomials sequence @xmath17 has the following simple expression @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "then the ordinary generating function of @xmath17 can be given by the continued fraction @xmath20 where @xmath21 for @xmath22    in order to prove this theorem , we need three lemmas . using the theory of the exponential riordan arrays ,",
