    "graphene and topological insulators have recently stimulated an enormous interest at both the theoretical and experimental levels ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these two systems share an attractive and unique property , namely , the fact that the electronic transport at low energies is not governed by the usual schrdinger equation , but rather by its relativistic counterpart : the dirac equation  @xcite . in graphene , a single layer of carbon atoms densely packed in a honeycomb lattice  @xcite , the band structure corresponds to a semimetallic phase whose fermi surface consists of an even number of isolated points .",
    "interestingly , the low - energy excitations around these points display a relativistic dispersion relation , and can be thus described by the two - dimensional dirac hamiltonian for massless fermions .",
    "conversely , in three - dimensional topological insulators , which are semiconducting alloys with a strong spin - orbit coupling  @xcite , the bulk band structure corresponds to a gapped insulating phase .",
    "nonetheless , these materials also support a robust surface conductivity which can be described by an odd number of two - dimensional massless dirac fermions .",
    "the recent interest in both graphene and topological insulators is two - fold . on the one hand , they provide concrete platforms where interesting phenomena were originally predicted in a high - energy context , for example , the klein paradox  @xcite , or axion electrodynamics  @xcite . on the other hand , they also foresee novel and useful device applications ( see for example ref .",
    "the emergence of massless dirac fermions in solid - state materials is not only an exciting area of condensed matter , but is also becoming an exciting topic in cold - atom physics ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    in high - energy physics ,",
    "a relativistic electron is described by a spin-@xmath3 fermion , an unavoidable fact that fixes the dimensionality of the dirac spinor  @xcite . in clear contrast , the pseudospin of an emergent relativistic fermion in solid - state materials depends on the geometry of the underlying lattice . for graphene ,",
    "the existence of two interpenetrating triangular lattices fixes the dimensionality of the dirac spinor , which in this case corresponds to a pseudospin-@xmath3 fermion .",
    "recently , some researchers have studied alternative lattices , e.g. , the @xmath4 lattice  @xcite , the line - centered - square ( lieb ) lattice  @xcite , and the kagome lattice  @xcite , where emergent massless relativistic fermions present a pseudospin-@xmath5 structure .",
    "these higher - spin relativistic fermions show some distinctive features with respect to graphene s dirac fermions , such as all - angle perfect tunneling  @xcite , particle localization @xcite , and the absence of the anomalous quantum hall effect @xcite . in view of these results ,",
    "a natural question arises : could we engineer an experimental setup where massless relativistic particles with arbitrary spin emerge ?",
    "moreover , would these higher spins host novel effects that have no counterpart in the low - spin cases ?    as we try to increase the pseudospin by modifying the lattice geometry , the corresponding structures become increasingly complex . due to the limited number of two - dimensional bravais lattices and materials that realize such lattices ,",
    "this construction seems doomed to a failure . in this article , we propose an alternative approach which is based on the fact that these pseudospin structures , which arise from complex lattice geometries , can be reproduced by a standard square lattice with a matrix hopping @xcite .",
    "such a model can be engineered with an optical lattice populated by multicomponent ultracold atoms with specific state - dependent hoppings .",
    "we show that such a setup presents a rich playground where the low - energy excitations can be described by massless relativistic particles with arbitrary spin .",
    "interestingly these fermions are governed by the weyl - like hamiltonian @xmath6 , which is the massless version of the dirac hamiltonian but can have any spin , and whose eigenstates we refer to as _ dirac - weyl fermions _ in this paper .    more explicitly , we demonstrate that a spin - dependent hopping , tuned according to the @xmath0-dimensional representations of the @xmath1(2 ) lie algebra , directly leads to a regime where the low - energy excitations are dirac - weyl fermions with pseudospin @xmath2 .",
    "we show that this platform hosts two different phases at half - filling : a semimetallic phase that occurs for half - integer @xmath2 , and a metallic phase that contains a flat zero - energy band at integer @xmath2 . in the semimetallic phase ,",
    "we show that a dirac - weyl fermion with high spin can be described as a collection of spin 1/2 counterparts , where each species has a different effective speed of light .",
    "accordingly , the low - energy transport is characterized by spin 1/2 dirac - weyl fermions moving at different velocities , an effect known as _ multi - refringence _ in the field of optics @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", we find exotic tunneling properties across a potential barrier , which shows a remarkable multi - refringent klein paradox .",

    "note that for half - integer spin , the berry phase is of abnormal parity @xmath67 , regardless of the dirac point or dirac - weyl fermion .",

    "the first bulk gap hosts a single edge - state . as @xmath314 is increased , the energy curves @xmath322 around @xmath323 are progressively squeezed while opening an energy gap . for @xmath315 , this energy gap",
    "is exactly located around @xmath148 and the energy curves @xmath322 disappear into the flat band , i.e. they are completely squeezed @xmath324 .",
    "therefore , the edge - states associated to these curves , hiding at @xmath148 , have a zero velocity in the limit @xmath325 , and thus can not contribute to the hall conductivity .",

    "note that a non - zero helicity is not allowed to convert into a zero helicity due to the violation of energy conservation .",

    "however , for integer spin where even and odd components of the spinor are decoupled , the boundary conditions require the continuity of each even spinor component , together with the continuity of a sum of two neighbouring odd components at @xmath329 and @xmath359 ( specifically , continuity of @xmath361 with @xmath362 ) .",
    "these conditions give @xmath363 equations that also equal to the number of unknowns , @xmath356=4s$ ] for integer spin .",
    "thus , in principle , the tunneling properties can be completely determined by the wavefunction and boundary conditions .",
    "since different helicity spinors carry a different current , the transmission and reflection coefficients have to be renormalized with respect to the incident current , i.e.,@xmath364/[\\phi_r^{h_0\\dag}s_x\\phi_r^{h_0}]$ ] and @xmath365/[\\phi_r^{h_0\\dag}s_x\\phi_r^{h_0}]$ ] according to the current density @xmath366 of the weyl - like hamiltonian .",
    "consequently , conservation of the current requires @xmath367 . in general , for incident particles with spin-@xmath2 dirac - weyl fermions and fixed helicity , the transmission show @xmath334$]-fringence .",
    "_ role of evanescent waves : _ in graphene , evanescent waves do nt play a role in the klein tunneling due to the single - layered cone structure . for multiple - layered cones however , evanescent waves will play an important role in the coupling and transformation of one helicity to another both inside and outside the barrier , by exerting cutoff conditions for each helicity component .",
    "we first consider the coupling of the incident helicity to the ones inside the barrier . for a low enough barrier",
    ", there are negative helicities inside the barrier which are not coupled ; they are evanescent .",
    "specifically , for an incident wave beyond the critical angle @xmath368 where @xmath369 or @xmath5 , all helicities are uncoupled , thus there is no transmission . for higher barriers , beyond the critical angle @xmath370 , only helicities of @xmath371",
    "are coupled in the form of propagating waves .",
    "however , the transmission properties would be modified dramatically in this regime . besides the cutoff condition inside the barrier",
    ", the evanescent waves also exert cutoff conditions for different helicities outside the barrier where a small helicity is transformed into a larger one .",
    "since @xmath372 , for incident wave beyond the critical angle @xmath373 , the transmitted wave with helicity @xmath349 become evanescent .",
    "this gives a cutoff condition for each helicity component which is larger than the helicity of the incident particle .",
    "it is clear that if the incident particle follows the outermost cone of the multicone structure , there will be no cutoff for any helicity outside the barrier .    in section  [ klein_section ]",
    "we present detailed numerical results of klein birefringent tunneling by evaluating the different transmission coefficients of spin-@xmath164 dirac - weyl fermions with a double cone structure . from the results there ,",
