    "presently , magnetic molecular nanoclusters draw great attention @xcite . the clusters are metal - organic molecules containing a number of ions , usually ions of transitive @xmath5-metals such as fe , mn , co , ni , etc . or the rare - earth ions , for example ho , y , la , etc .",
    "they are shortly denoted as x@xmath6 , where x is fe , mn , etc . , @xmath7 is the number of x - ions in the molecule , although this denotation is not complete and unambiguous .",
    "the most known and investigated nanoclusters are fe@xmath8 , fe@xmath9 , fe@xmath10 , mn@xmath11 , v@xmath12 , etc .",
    "magnetic nanoclusters are also called molecular , or mesoscopic , magnets because they occupy intermediary position between microscopical objects such as atoms and ions , which possess spin moments , and macroscopical magnetic bodies characterized by magnetization , average magnetic moment per volume unit .",
    "such mesoscopic magnets possess interesting quantum properties @xcite : a ) presence of a quantum hysteresis loop of a single molecule , b ) macroscopic quantum tunneling of the full magnetic moment of a molecule , c ) effects of a quantum interference at magnetic reversal in a field perpendicular to an easy axis ( the effects are related with the berry - phase ) @xcite .",
    "their properties are rather interesting in the range of submillimeter frequencies @xcite .",
    "from practical point of view molecular magnets are interesting as building blocks for construction of new materials and nanostructures .",
    "they are also considered as perspective objects for quantum computer science @xcite and magnetic refrigerating tequnics @xcite .    among this wide variety of such mesoscopic magnets x@xmath6 nanoclusters with formula mn@xmath0o@xmath13br(oac)@xmath13(dbm)@xmath13 @xcite ,",
    "where oac is the acetate ion , and dbm is the dybenzoylmethane ( see fig",
    ". 1 ) are of special interest .",
    "it is known @xcite , that this molecule behaves at low temperatures as an isolated magnet with an easy axis along @xmath14 axis and height of a power barrier of 1.25 mev .",
    "the point symmetry group of molecule mn@xmath0 is ( approximately ) @xmath15 . according to @xcite , antiferromagnetic interactions of three ions mn@xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) and mn@xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , located on axis @xmath14 ( passing through br ions ) , form ferrimagnetic spin structure with spin of @xmath1 in the ground state .",
    "the first excited multiplet ( @xmath20 ) is separated from the ground one by an energy gap of @xmath21 mev .",
    "magnetic properties of cluster mn@xmath0 in the ground state ( multiplet ) of @xmath1 were investigated in @xcite . in the present paper the full magnetization process of mn@xmath0 , including all its actual multiplets @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ,",
    "is theoretically considered , and the formulas needed to determine exchange constants of the cluster from experimental data are obtained .",
    "remarkable and rare feature of considered here nanocluster mn@xmath0 , differing it from other multispin molecules , is that its exchange spin hamiltonian supposes an exact diagonalization .",
    "this provides a reliable basis for comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental data and it is important for development of new experimental techniques of research of high - spin molecules .",
    "a spin hamiltonian of considered molecule mn@xmath0 within the framework of heisenberg model reads @xmath22 where exchange hamiltonian @xmath23    here @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the spins of ions mn@xmath16 ( @xmath28 ) and mn@xmath18 ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are their @xmath32-factors , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are exchange constants , and @xmath35 is the external magnetic field .",

    "comparison of these figures with above mentioned value of energy @xmath41 mev of the first excited multiplet shows that @xmath42 .",
    "this means that it is possible to be limited to the exchange spin hamiltonian for calculation of a full magnetization curve . if necessary",
    ", the influence of magnetic anisotropy can be taken into account by means of the perturbation theory .",
    "to find the energy spectrum of exchange spin hamiltonian @xmath43 one can use the following scheme of the spin moments addition : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the total spin of a molecule and @xmath46 is the total spin of ions mn@xmath16 .",
    "the chosen scheme of spin addition is not unique .",
    "it is possible to choose other ways , say @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "it is known , that such arbitrariness does not influence final results because for any addition scheme the space of the states forms a full set @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to notice that it is usual to use four moment pared addition scheme , for example , @xmath49 or @xmath50 . due to natural reasons the above - stated scheme ( 3 + 1 ) is more convenient .",
    "transition between various schemes of addition can be made by means of racah factors or wigner @xmath51-symbols ( fano factors ) .",
    "the corresponding wave functions being eigenfunctions of operators @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are    @xmath60    where @xmath61 are the clebsch - gordan coefficients . according to the addition scheme @xmath62 takes all integer values from @xmath63 to @xmath64 , i.e. from 0 to 4 .",
    "indexes @xmath65 ( @xmath66 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 12 ) run all integer ( or half - integer for @xmath67 ) values from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "the addition rule of @xmath70-indexes should be taken into account : @xmath71 , etc .",
    "allowable values @xmath72 are shown in table  [ tab1 ] .    from this table",
    "one sees that some values @xmath72 appear in different combinations of @xmath62 and @xmath73 , i.e. various wave functions correspond to them .",
    "this fact is characterized by the factor of degeneration @xmath74 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "addition of the moments @xmath46 and @xmath27 is described by table  [ tab2 ] .",

    "using the considered scheme of spin addition , it is easy to find the energy spectrum of exchange hamiltonian @xmath43 : @xmath80 where it is supposed that @xmath81 . if necessary , distinction between @xmath30 and @xmath31 is easy for taking into account under the perturbation theory .",
    "it should be reminded that quantum number @xmath82 accepts all half - integer values from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "assuming @xmath83 and normalizing energy of levels on @xmath84 scale one obtains @xmath85 i.e. the spectrum consists of 48 levels completely defined by dimensionless parameter @xmath86 .    at this stage",
    "it is expedient to address to experimental data . using table  [ tab2 ] and eq .",
    "( [ eq07 ] ) , it is easy to be convinced that the observable ground state ( @xmath87 ) can be realized in the given model only if @xmath88 .",
    "indeed , at increase of @xmath89 level @xmath90 consequently crosses levels @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 at points @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 . as it is supposed that @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the area of @xmath89 change is limited to interval @xmath99 .",
    "using known position of the first excited multiplet with @xmath20 ( it is easy to be convinced that it corresponds to @xmath100 ) , we receive an additional condition for determining of exchange parameters @xmath84 and @xmath101 ( or @xmath84 and @xmath89 ) : @xmath102 @xmath103 mev .",
    "now we consider a curve of magnetization of molecule mn@xmath0 at @xmath104",
    ". we should take into account the above mentioned data on the power spectrum . from eq .",
    "( [ eq06 ] ) follows that the basic condition of system corresponds to @xmath105 .",
    "it is obvious that there is a consecutive crossing of levels @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 with the increase of the magnetic field .",
    "according to table  [ tab2 ] , the value of quantum number @xmath109 does not change .",
    "the values of magnetic fields at which there are these crossings are easily calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq06 ] ) .",
    "they are consequently equal to @xmath110    at each point of crossing there is the corresponding change of the ground state accompanied by jump @xmath111 of the magnetic moment of the molecule . the curve of magnetization is shown in fig .",
    "2 .    having measured the value of the field corresponding to the first jump of the magnetic moment it is possible to determine value @xmath84 and after that the value of @xmath101 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq08 ] ) and ( [ eq09 ] ) .",
    "@xmath112    as shown above , parameter @xmath89 are in interval @xmath113",
    ". this enables to estimate the bottom limits for critical fields @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 :    @xmath117    thus , the full magnetization problem have to be solved by megagauss magnetic field technique @xcite .",
    "isotherms of magnetization @xmath118 at any temperatures can be calculated in a standard way by means of the partition function @xmath119 where normalized energy @xmath120 , factors of degeneration @xmath121 and @xmath78 , and parameter @xmath89 are defined above , @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "the magnetic moment of the system is then determined as @xmath124 of course , practical calculations of isotherms @xmath118 in actual region of temperatures can be reduced essentially if one uses properties of the power spectrum of a molecule .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "at discussion of motivation of works on molecular magnetism of nanoclusters as one of arguments frequently results the thesis that nanoclusters , being mesoscopic objects , allow to throw light on not quite clear questions of transition from quantum laws , characteristic for atoms and molecules , to classical ones , characteristic for macroscopical bodies .",
    "the model of a multispin nanocluster mn@xmath0 investigated in this work is represented rather perspective in this respect since it , being rather simple and admitting an exact diagonalization of its hamiltonian , is substantially interesting and rich for the description of quantum transformations having well investigated analogues in macroscopical magnetism .",
    "for instance , classical analogue of the quantum jumps of the magnetic moment of a molecule considered above ( fig .",
    "2 ) is effect of a turn magnetic sublattices ( spin flip ) in ferrimagnetics , induced by an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the role of sublattices in a case of mn@xmath0 is played by ions mn@xmath16 and mn@xmath18 or their total spins @xmath46 and @xmath27 .",
    "the analogue of full magnetization of ferrimagnetic is the magnetic moment of a molecule equal to @xmath125 .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq02 ] ) supposes generalization for any spins @xmath126 ( @xmath127 = 1 , 2 , 3 ) and @xmath128 . limiting transition to classics ( @xmath129 )",
    "is naturally performed at the additional assumption @xmath130 .",
    "the last can be interpreted as the requirement of independence of @xmath131 the exchange field between sublattices .",
    "it is natural to normalize the magnetic moments so that @xmath132 were analogues of magnetization sublattices .",
    "then the picture of transition from `` ferrimagnetic '' spin structure with @xmath133 to `` ferromagnetic '' ( @xmath134 ) looks the same as previously described ( fig .",
    "222 ) , but the number and amplitude of jumps aspire , accordingly , to @xmath135 and 0 with the increase of @xmath131 , i.e. the transition becomes quasi - continuous . to each jump ( @xmath136 ) there corresponds the value of a field at which there is a crossing of @xmath137 and @xmath138 levels , i.e. @xmath139 .",
    "it also follows that critical fields to which the beginning and the end of spin reorientation correspond are equal @xmath140 @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a constant of a molecular field known in the theory of ferrimagnetism .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) coincide with those from the theory of spin - flip in macroscopical ferrimagnetics @xcite ( the second equation coincides precisely , and the first one coincides to an order of @xmath143 ) .",
    "it is natural , that this quantum amendment aspires to the classical formula to 0 with growth of a spin value .",
    "but for nanoclusters with small value of a spin in the ground state distinction between the quantum and classical description in this respect is essential .",
    "it is possible to tell that this distinction is caused by quantum fluctuations of spins in a vicinity of the critical fields .",
    "they are maximal in area of @xmath144 and close to zero in area @xmath145 .",
    "quantum fluctuations are important also for consideration of a question on value of the magnetic moments of spin subsystems ( ions mn@xmath16 and mn@xmath18 in this case ) . in the classical theory",
    "it is supposed that the magnetic moments sublattices are constants .",
    "quantum mechanical consideration shows that quantum reduction of sublattices , especially strong near @xmath144 , takes place .",
    "in work @xcite it is shown for a nanocluster mn@xmath11 on the basis of the perturbation theory .",
    "it is desirable to do this for mn@xmath0 , which will be given in the future publications .",
    "let us note one more interesting difference between spin transformations in `` ferrimagnetic '' nanocluster and those in macroscopical ferrimagnetics .",
    "the last are considered as cooperative phase transitions of second kind @xcite with corresponding critical anomalies , while the first are essentially quantum transformations occuring in one molecule .",
    "possibly , the role of thermal fluctuations of a parameter in a quantum case is played by quantum spin fluctuations attention was paid on ( for a case of nanoclusters such as mn@xmath11 and fe@xmath8 ) in works @xcite , which however are executed in a model of giant spin , i.e. in strongly reduced hilbert space .",
    "the model of a multispin system considered in this work with magnetic transformation is interesting and in this respect , as admitting the exact solution in full hilbert space of the system .    at last , we note one more important question which deserves studying within the framework of the given model .",
    "it is known , that energy of chemical binding in molecules depends on a spin state . in this case",
    "the magnetic field , changing the spin state , influences also chemical binding of a molecule and thus its configuration . in its turn ,",
    "change of a configuration influences critical fields of spin transformations .",
    "in molecular magnetism the situation can be more various and rich . in this connection",
    "we note paper @xcite in which the effect of downturn of configuration symmetry of a nanocluster in a situation with the spin - degenerated ground state is investigated .",
