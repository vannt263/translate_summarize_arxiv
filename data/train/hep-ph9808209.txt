    "in this talk i ll briefly summarize the results of our two - loop calculation of the @xmath0 amplitude@xcite .",
    "also , some technical issues@xcite , useful for the evaluation of two - loop graphs in a number of processes , are discussed .",
    "the investigation of the @xmath0 interaction is of particular interest at present , because there are several experiments which will bring new information after a long break in the experimental activity .",
    "of special interest in this workshop is the pionium experiment dirac ( ps 212 ) at cern@xcite which aims at measuring the lifetime of the @xmath1 atomic bound state .",
    "the relevant quantity there is the difference of the i=0 and i=2 @xmath2-wave scattering lengths , @xmath3 .",
    "the forthcoming k@xmath4 data from the kloe detector starting to operate at da@xmath5ne in frascati will also add substantially to our understanding of the low - energy @xmath0 interaction .",
    "similar data from bnl ( e865 ) are already coming to analysis@xcite .",
    "an attempt at iucf to see pionium production in the reaction @xmath6 has given only the upper limit , 1 @xmath7 , for the production cross section@xcite . the standard method to measure @xmath0 scattering at high energies is to study the pion induced pion production , @xmath8 . at low energies , however , the extraction of @xmath0 information from this reaction is complicated by the fact that there one - pion - exchange does not necessarily dominate .    from theoretical point of view",
    "the interest in the @xmath0 interaction is well motivated .",
    "the question is to what extent our picture of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is valid .",
    "the @xmath0 studies will provide a test .",
    "the technique employed here , chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , is a systematic approach to build the chiral symmetry of qcd into the low - energy amplitudes .",
    "the tool to do that is the effective lagrangian , so the @xmath0 studies provide also a testing ground for the effective field theory techniques . another aspect of particular interest recently is the size of the quark - antiquark vacuum condensate@xcite . according to the standard picture",
    "the condensate should be `` large '' , whereas the , so called , generalized chpt allows for a `` small '' value for the condensate .",
    "generally speaking , these two values correspond respectively to a small , about 0.2 , and a large , around 0.3 , value for the isoscalar @xmath2-wave scattering length .",
    "another technique to address the @xmath0 problem is also making progress , namely the lattice approach .",
    "the lattice method can give estimates of both the vacuum condensate and the @xmath0 scattering lengths .",
    "however , some questions remain , especially the role of the dynamical quarks , or the relatively high pion mass still involved . in any case",
    ", some encouraging results have already been obtained@xcite .",
    "chpt is a systematic expansion of the green functions in terms of external momenta and quark masses .",
    "a number of theoretical assumptions are invoked .",
    "these include that the chiral symmetry of qcd is spontaneously broken , and that the low - energy singularities of the theory are generated by the goldstone degrees of freedom@xcite .    in this talk",
    "the @xmath0 interaction will be discussed in chiral @xmath9 . a technical remark referring to the evaluation of some loop diagrams is included .",
    "then a summary of the results relevant for the pionium system will be given together with some prospects for future work .",
    "the chiral effective lagrangian can be written as @xmath10 where the indices refer to the chiral counting , the number of derivatives of the pion field or twice the power of the quark mass terms .",
    "the two - loop calculation involves the evaluation of the amplitude up to and including terms @xmath11 . as a consequence",
    ", the part @xmath12 appears at tree level , the part @xmath13 at both tree- and one - loop level and finally the piece @xmath14 at tree- , 1-loop and 2-loop level .",
    "it is convenient to adopt for @xmath14 the form @xmath15 where the brackets @xmath16 refer to trace over the flavour indices and @xmath17 is the pion decay constant in the chiral limit .",
    "it is convenient to work with the field @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an external pseudoscalar source .",
    "the second constant appearing in @xmath14 , @xmath20 , is proportional to the vacuum condensate .",
    "the next order lagrangian is of the type @xmath21 where the @xmath22 s are the low - energy constants required by the one - loop renormalization of the @xmath0 amplitude .",
    "the explicit form of the terms @xmath23 can be found e.g. in ref.@xcite .",
    "the form of @xmath12 has been given in ref.@xcite .",
    "a number of processes contain the same topologies in two - loop graphs :    * vector and axialvector 2-point functions * @xmath24 * scalar and vector form factors of the pion * @xmath25 * @xmath26    as an example let us consider the fish graph in figure 1 contributing to @xmath0 scattering .",
    "the contribution is proportional to @xmath27 where @xmath28 the integration over @xmath29 gives the loop ",

    "the leading order result ( @xmath53 ) is due to weinberg@xcite and the one - loop piece ( @xmath54 ) due to gasser and leutwyler@xcite . in the isospin basis",
    "@xmath55 the relevant quantity for pionium decay is the charge exchange amplitude @xmath56\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the decay rate @xmath57 the two - loop amplitude involves six low - energy constants ( the one - loop level has four @xmath58 s , and the two - loop piece six @xmath59s@xcite .",
    "they appear , however , in six independent combinations , @xmath60 . ) to clarify the structure of these constants @xmath61 is taken as an example : @xmath62 \\nonumber \\\\ + 2 \\,l_2^r \\,l_4^r -\\frac{1}{6}\\left[k_1 + 4 k_2 + k_4 \\right ] + r_4^r \\ ! \\left .",
    "{ \\vrule height0.86em width0em depth0.86em }   \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 in the framework of the generalized chpt the @xmath0 amplitude has been evaluated@xcite in dispersive manner .",
    "the pieces fixed by unitarity , @xmath17 s and @xmath64 s , agree with our results .",
    "the main difference is that the lagrangian approach taken here allows for determining the structure of the constants @xmath65 of the polynomial part in terms of the pion mass and the low - energy constants of both @xmath66 and @xmath11 .",
    "the knowledge of the mass dependence makes it possible to compare results with the lattice calculations where unphysical value for the pion mass is still needed@xcite .",
    "for comparison with experiment numerical values for the constants @xmath67 and @xmath59 s will be needed .",
    "the resonance saturation with the main contributions from the scalar and vector mesons can be used for the @xmath59 s .",
    "the influence of these values is small to the final amplitudes .",
    "the main effect comes from the constants @xmath68 which show up already at order @xmath69 .",
    "a detailed study of @xmath68 s with constraints from the roy equations is on the way@xcite , and with those values one can hope to reach a precision of 23 % for the @xmath2-wave scattering lengths .",
    "the values used in ref.@xcite were taken from the k@xmath4 analysis of ref.@xcite or from the @xmath0 @xmath70-wave scattering lengths fixing @xmath71 and @xmath72 , i.e. two sets of values were taken for the numerical comparisons .",
    "for the set i we have@xcite : @xmath73 and set ii : @xmath74 the phase shift difference @xmath75 for these sets of low - energy constants has been given in figure [ fig2 ] as a function of the centre - of - mass energy .",
    "for the @xmath2-wave scattering length we get @xmath76\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.\\hspace{14.5mm}+{\\it x_2}^2 \\left[\\frac{58}{7}k_1 + \\frac{96}{7}k_2 + 5 k_3+\\frac{11}{2 } k_4 + \\frac{1697}{84}\\frac{l}{16\\pi^2}+\\mbox{analytic}\\right]\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.\\hspace{9.5 mm } + o({\\it x_2}^3 ) \\;\\;\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and numerically at scale @xmath77=1 gev for the isoscalar @xmath2-wave scattering length and the difference of the @xmath2-wave scattering lengths with set i @xmath78 in this case it is seen that the nonanalytic terms dominate both the one - loop and the two - loop corrections .",
    "the value for @xmath79 corresponding to set ii is 0.250 .",
    "the experimental figure obtained by using the universal curve is 0.29@xmath800.04@xcite .",
    "using dispersion sum rules the constants @xmath81 have been determined@xcite and within the quoted errors these values are consistent with set ii .",
    "the corrections in the loop expansion for the scattering length difference , @xmath79 , seem to be converging quite rapidly , about 20 % correction from the tree level to one - loop calculation and 6 % from one - loop to two - loop ( calculated with set i ) .",
    "therefore , in near future we can expect the precision of the calculation to reach 2 - 3 % level which is significant in strong interaction physics .",
    "this implies that the analyses of @xmath0 data will have to be made with extreme care .",
    "this is the challenge for the k@xmath82 experiments in brookhaven and frascati , and the pionium experiment at cern .",
