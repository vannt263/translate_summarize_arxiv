    "quantum optomechanics has recently witnessed a rapid succession of key advances , with important milestones including the cooling of several systems to the quantum ground state of vibration  @xcite , the demonstration of strong optomechanical coupling  @xcite and of quantum coherent coupling between optical and phonon fields  @xcite , the realization of optomechanical systems from ultracold atomic ensembles  @xcite , and impressive advances toward quantum state transfer  @xcite , to mention just a few examples .",
    "these developments hint at the promise for optomechanics applications in quantum metrology  @xcite , quantum information science  @xcite , and also in possible tests of fundamental physics questions  @xcite .",
    "so far , though , the focus of most advances has been on single mode dynamics of the oscillator  @xcite , and only few authors have started to investigate the effects of multiple mechanical modes  @xcite . in complete analogy with the situation in quantum optics , however , single - mode quantum acoustics fails to capture many of its most important aspects , including most obviously perhaps propagation phenomena , nonlinear acoustical effects , focusing and defocusing of acoustic waves , etc .",
    "this paper represents a step toward the development of multimode quantum acoustics .",
    "the specific situation we consider is a multimode mechanical field  perhaps provided by several mechanical oscillators or atomic samples trapped near extrema of an optical lattice , the mode coupling being provided by a common optical field . in some ways , this can be thought of as describing a situation analogous to collisions in atomic systems .",
    "very much like collisions are effective interactions between atoms resulting from the elimination of the electromagnetic field , the optically mediated effective coupling between phononic modes can also be thought of in these terms .",
    "generally speaking , collisions tend to be largely incoherent processes resulting e.g. in decoherence and dephasing in atomic ensembles , but it is known from ultracold atomic systems that this needs not be the case . in ultracold systems , such as quantum degenerate atomic gases , collisions can be a coherent process , and have been demonstrated to lead to nonlinear atom optics effects  @xcite such as e.g matter - wave four - wave mixing , soliton generation , the creation of entangled atom pairs , and more . in analogy to that situation , one can expect similar effects to occur in quantum acoustics .",
    "our main goal is to develop a simple theory that shows that this is indeed the case , and that incoherent effects due to quantum fluctuations  associated primarily with the elimination of the electromagnetic field  need not overwhelm coherent effects .",
    "this paves the way to investigate nonlinear effects in phonon physics reminiscent of those encountered in nonlinear optics and nonlinear atom optics ; with the promise of similarly exciting applications .",
    "our starting point is a relatively general discussion of optically mediated effective interactions between many mechanical modes , discussing in some detail the quantum noise and damping associated with that interaction , both for linear and quadratic optomechanical coupling .",
    "we identify a number of specific forms of the effective interaction that lead to qualitatively different dynamics , in particular a regime where the coupling of the quantum fluctuations of the mechanical modes is intrinsically nonlinear .",
    "we then illustrate the general analysis with an example involving just two mechanical modes , with emphasis on two limiting cases , the resolved sideband and the doppler regimes .",
    "a specific example is given by the state transfer between two mechanical modes , for example a bose - einstein condensate coupled to the center - of - mass mode of a moving end mirror of a fabry - prot resonator through a cavity field .",
    "we comment on the optimization of the transfer fidelity using squeezed input light as the optically mediating light field and conclude with some general remarks and outlook .",
    "we consider a multimode optomechanical system described in terms of a set of @xmath0 modes of effective masses @xmath1 , bare frequencies @xmath2 and damping rates @xmath3 . the interaction between these modes is assumed to be mediated by a single mode of the optical resonator , of nominal frequency @xmath4 and driven by a monochromatic external field of frequency @xmath5 .",
    "a realization of this system could be a high - finesse fabry - prot resonator with a series of internal non - absorptive dielectric membranes such as depicted in fig .",

    "the hamiltonian governing the system is @xmath6 where @xmath7 describes the cavity field mode , pumped externally by a field of frequency @xmath5 at a rate @xmath8 , @xmath9 describes the mechanical modes , with @xmath10 = \\delta_{jk}$ ] .",
    "the optomechanical interaction is @xmath11 in the linear case and @xmath12 in the quadratic case , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 linear and quadratic single - photon optomechanical coupling coefficients , respectively .",

    "[ fig : heating ] , which plots the evolution of the variances of the motional quadratures of the mechanical modes when their effective frequencies are matched around the center of the lorentzian curve on the red side of the cavity field .",
    "the mechanical modes are both assumed to be initially in thermal equilibrium . in the absence of cross interaction , both oscillators are subject to cold damping ( dotted and dot - dashed lines ) with cooling rates that differ since @xmath137 .",
    "the coupling changes the situation significantly , with both cooling rates now markedly slower ( solid and dashed lines ) .",
    "this is a result of the exchange of thermal excitations between the two oscillators that inhibits their direct optical cooling .",
    "( note that our numerical calculations suggest that the long - time limit and thus the cooling limit does not change . ) performing a normal - mode analysis on the two modes reveals that the two out - of - phase oscillations decouple from the cavity field , while the two in - phase modes are cooled with an increased damping rate .",
    "we now turn to the resonances @xmath131 that occur on the wings of the dispersion curves . in these cases",
    "the optical spring effect dominates over cold damping ( or amplification ) , a consequence of the faster decay of the lorentzian @xmath126 ( with @xmath138 ) compared to the dispersive nature of @xmath52 , which decreases as @xmath139 .",
    "that situation is therefore characterized by the dominance of coherent exchange between the two oscillators , and we approximate the corresponding drift matrix by @xmath140 in this regime , and provided that the noise sources associated with the optical field can be managed , one can realize coherent effects such as quantum state transfer between the two mechanical modes .",
    "we return to this effect in the doppler regime , which we consider in the following .      in the doppler regime , @xmath141 ,",
    "the width of the optical cavity is so large that it washes out the two distinct features of @xmath52 and @xmath126 , characteristic of the resolved sideband regime , and one can approximate @xmath142 the qualitative behavior of the effective frequencies @xmath143 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : doppler_frequency_matching ] for @xmath144 and shows the intersections of the two curves on the red - detuned side of the cavity resonance .",
    "( they would lie on the blue - detuned side for @xmath145 ) . since @xmath146 decays with the third power of the cavity linewidth",
    "while @xmath147 scales as @xmath148 , it follows that for the large cavity damping rates , characteristic of the doppler regime , we can neglect in first approximation the effects of cold damping ( or amplification ) and at resonance we find again @xmath149 note that the argument leading to this result is different in the resolved sideband limit , where the radiation induced damping can be neglected if the effective detuning is outside of the mechanical sideband , and in the doppler regime , in which case it is negligible due to the large cavity linewidth .",
    "the previous discussion showed that both , the resolved sideband and the doppler regimes , provide situations where cold damping can be neglected and the two oscillators are resonantly coupled by the effective coherent interaction @xmath150 this is the familiar beam splitter hamiltonian , which is known in particular to lead to quantum state swapping between the two oscillators .",
    "however , an important issue is that the optical field mediating the interaction also results in the appearance of quantum noise , further limiting the fidelity of state transfer in addition to the clamping noise associated with the mechanical coupling to thermal reservoirs . clamping noise can be reduced in principle in cryogenic environments or perhaps in levitated structures  @xcite .",
    "what we show in this brief section is that the fundamental quantum noise associated with the optical field can also be reduced in principle by the use of squeezed input fields with correlation functions  @xcite    @xmath151    where @xmath5 is the central frequency of a squeezing device , and positive - valued @xmath152 and complex - valued @xmath153 are the squeezing parameters which define the strength of the squeezing as well as its direction in phase space , given by the complex phase of @xmath153 . in the following ,",
    "we assume an ideal squeezed state which satisfies @xmath154 the equations of motion for vacuum input noise are recovered by substituting @xmath155 .",
    "for concreteness we consider the explicit situation of a hybrid two - mode mechanical system where one of the modes is a recoil - induced side - mode of a bose - einstein condensate  @xcite trapped inside an optical resonator with an oscillating end - mirror , and the other is the center - of - mass mode of oscillation of that mirror . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the case where a system is prepared in such a way that the shifted optomechanical frequencies of the two oscillators @xmath156 and @xmath157 are equal , @xmath158 , the equations of motion for the quadratures of the coupled mechanical oscillators reduce to @xmath159 where the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the oscillating mirror and the condensate side - mode respectively , and the cross - coupling frequency is @xmath160 for a squeezed input field the two - time correlation function of the effective noise can be approximated as @xmath161+n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\delta(t - t'),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath162 .",
    "here we have assumed that intrinsic mechanical decoherence is negligible for the time scales of interest .",
    "figure  [ fig : thermal_bec ] shows the co - evolution of the variance of one of the motional quadratures of the two oscillators . in this example the resonator is driven by a coherent field and the initial states of the bec and the moving mirror are the ground state and a thermal state with mean phonon number @xmath163 , respectively .",
    "as expected , the fidelity of the coherent quantum state transfer , which would be unity at times @xmath164 , with @xmath165 integer , in the absence of noise , is increasingly reduced by the quantum fluctuations of the light field , even without intrinsic mechanical decoherence mechanisms .    the use of a squeezed optical field to reduce the detrimental effect of quantum noise",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : squeezed_bec ] , where the improved fidelity is readily apparent in particular at time @xmath166 . as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : fidelity_bec ] and  [ fig : fidelity_bec_squeezed ] , the state transfer fidelity depends strongly on the phase difference between the cavity field and a squeezing device . for @xmath167 , the fluctuations in the position quadrature of the cavity field are minimized so that very high fidelity state transfer is achieved , @xmath168 for @xmath169 in our example .",
    "as would be intuitively expected , we also find that strong squeezing leads to an increased sensitivity of the state transfer fidelity on that relative phase . as a comparison to fig .",
    "[ fig : fidelity_bec ] , which is for a bec side - mode initially in the ground state and the oscillating mirror in a thermal state with @xmath170 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fidelity_bec_squeezed ] displays the fidelity of state transfer where the bec is initially in a squeezed state with @xmath171 and @xmath172 . the transfer fidelity in that case exhibits an increased dependence of the relative phase between the cavity field and a squeezing device , as would be expected . in the optimal case @xmath167 and @xmath169 ,",
    "the fidelity of squeezed state transfer is @xmath173 , which is somewhat lower than for a vacuum state , a consequence of the higher sensitivity of squeezed states to decoherence .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed the optically mediated interaction between multimode phonon fields in cavity optomechanical systems where it is possible to adiabatically eliminate the electromagnetic field .",
    "a number of possible forms of this interaction were identified , including multimode beam - splitter interactions and , in the case of quadratic optomechanical coupling , a plethora of possible nonlinear effective interactions , such as analogs of second - harmonic generation and four - wave mixing in nonlinear optics .",
    "the specific forms of the effective interaction depend sensitively on the sign of the couplings .",
    "importantly , we found that incoherent effects due to quantum fluctuations  associated primarily with the elimination of the electromagnetic field  need not overwhelm coherent mode - coupling effects . as a result",
    "one can expect that analogs of nonlinear effects such as four - wave mixing , soliton generation , the creation of entangled phonon pairs , and others should be achievable in quantum acoustics .",
    "our treatment was kept sufficiently generic that it can be applied to a wide variety of systems and parameter regimes , and as a concrete example we have discussed quantum state transfer between a momentum side - mode of a bose - einstein condensate and the center - of - mass mode of oscillation of the end mirror of a fabry - prot interferometer .",
    "we showed how decoherence effects can be reduced significantly in that case by the use of squeezed optical fields .",
    "future work will expand these results to more general situations and apply it to the study of practical situations where the effective mode coupling is nonlinear and investigate particular effects such as phase conjugation , entanglement , and the creation of entangled phonon pairs , for example .",
    "we will also exploit pulsed optomechanics ideas to further expand the toolbox of quantum optomechanics ."
