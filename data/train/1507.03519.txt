    "richard feynman in his lecture `` the character of physical law ''  @xcite has outlined a series of crucial unsolved problems of modern physics . among them",
    "there is an unfilled gap between quantum mechanics and the physics of large scale motion in the universe .",
    "predominantly , it is a theory of quantum gravitation the lecture encourages physicists to search for these solutions  @xcite .",
    "relativistic hydrodynamics  @xcite perhaps can cover this wide region of the scientific interest .",
    "its scope of interests spreads from physics of plasma up to neutron stars , black holes , supernovae , compact binary systems , dense clusters , collapsing stars , the early universe , etc  @xcite .",
    "here we shall consider the relativistic hydrodynamical equations in the light of a description of the superfluid vacuum medium - the medium consisting of enormous amount of virtual pairs of particles - antiparticles with opposite orientations of spins .",
    "that is , the pairs possess zero spin  @xcite .",
    "we shall try to trace the emergence of the quantum equations ( the klein - gordon equation and in the non - relativistic limit the schrdinger equation ) from the relativistic hydrodynamical equation + the continuity equation .",
    "it turns out , that for solving this task , we need to find the quantum potential through applying the internal pressure to fick s laws .",
    "second , we shall try applying the relativistic hydrodynamical equation for the description of the motion of spiral galaxies . here",
    "we introduce a viscosity of the medium which is equal to zero in averaged on time but has a non - zero dispersion  @xcite . due to this trick",
    "we find that the orbital velocity of the spiral galaxy attains flat level at large distances from the galactic center .",
    "essentially , fluctuations of the viscosity about zero describes exchanging energy of the orbital rotation with the zero - point fluctuations of the physical vacuum on the ultra - low frequencies . figuratively speaking",
    ", the dark matter appears to us as the ultra - low vacuum fluctuations .",
    "here we first outline the general formulas which will then be used further .",
    "the relativistic hydrodynamics starts from a description of the energy - momentum tensor  @xcite @xmath0 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the functions per unit volume .",
    "they are expressed in units of pressure , joule / m@xmath3  =  pa . the metric tensor @xmath4 has the spacelike signature @xmath5 .",
    "the 4-velocity @xmath6 meets the condition @xmath7 where @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "here we follow the convention that the units of space and time are chosen such that @xmath9 . however ,",
    "sometimes we shall use the international system of units where the speed of light has the customary value equal about @xmath10 m / s .",
    "the four - gradient ( both covariant and contravariant ) and the four - laplacian ( the dalembert operator ) compactly written read : @xmath11 since we adopted @xmath9 length is measured here in unit of @xmath12 .",
    "we shall write either @xmath13 or @xmath14 when the customary units of time are needed . in the last case we write @xmath15 and  @xmath16 .",
    "an initial step in studying the relativistic hydrodynamical flows begins from writting the conservation laws of energy and momentum @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "here we need to be careful .",
    "our task is to write the relativistic equations of hydrodynamics , which would took into consideration quantum effects .",
    "appearance of the quantum potential in the course of computations gives guaranty that the computations are correct  @xcite .",
    "this potential is a fundamental element , which creates a geometrodynamic picture of the quantum world in the non - relativistic domain , a relativistic curved space - time background , and the quantum gravity domain  @xcite .",
    "a final aim of the computations is to derive the klein - gordon equation and the schrdinger equation in the non - relativistic limit . with this aim in mind ,",
    "we rewrite the conservation law in the following view @xmath18 observe that the terms @xmath19 and @xmath20 have dimensions of energy .",
    "here @xmath21 is the density distribution of the virtual particles populating the medium .",
    "it is equal to number of the sub - particles per unit volume , @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the article is organized by the following manner .",
    "[ sect2 ] deals with the perfect fluid .",
    "it consists of two subsections . in the first subsection",
    "we define relativistic fick s laws , and from here we compute the relativistic quantum potential .",
    "the second subsection considers the scalar field @xmath23 based on which the klein - gordon equation in the relativistic limit and the schrdinger equation in the non - relativistic limit are derived .",
    "[ sect3 ] considers a relativistic non - perfect fluid , that is the viscous fluid .",
    "we get the relativistic navier - stokes equation and further we get the equation for the vorticity .",
    "the vorticity and the orbital speed are considered for the case of the electron - positron pair .",
    "[ sect4 ] considers formation of the vortex on the galactic scales .",
    "formation of the flat orbital speed for the rotating spiral galaxy is the subject of consideration .",
    "[ sec5 ] summarizes the results .",
    "it turns out , that the equation  ( [ eq=3 ] ) can be reduced either to the klein - gordon equation or to the schrdinger equation depending on the relativistic or non - relativistic limit .",
    "however we first should show that the term @xmath24 is nothing like the quantum potential . with this aim in mind ,",
    "we need to use the relativistic fick s laws . here we shall write the partial derivatives  ( [ eq=2 ] ) writing down @xmath14 rather than @xmath13 .",
    "let us begin .",
    "the first fick s law in the relativistic limit has the following form @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the diffusion constant having the dimension of length@xmath27/time .",
    "the law  ( [ eq=4 ] ) says that diffusion flux vector , @xmath28 , is induced by the inhomogeneous distribution of the mass density @xmath29 within the 4d space - time volume .",
    "here @xmath30  @xcite and",
    "the mass @xmath31 is that of the volume @xmath32 of the medium in question ( @xmath33 is the mass of the single sub - particle and @xmath34 is the amount of them populating the volume @xmath35  @xcite ) .",
    "not to be confused the diffusion flux vector @xmath36 with the density current @xmath37  @xcite , where @xmath38 is the fluid 4-velocity and @xmath29 is the proper rest - mass density .",
    "the diffusion flux vector @xmath36 can be seen as a result of scattering of the sub - particles on each other due to the collisions .",
    "we need to define the diffusion coefficient  @xmath26 .",
    "first we introduce a hypothesis that all space - time is filled with virtual radiations with frequency @xmath39 .",
    "so , we define @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the light speed in the physical vacuum , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 are the absolute dielectric permittivity of classical vacuum and the vacuum permeability , respectively .",
    "observe that the zero - point energy of the radiation is @xmath44 .",
    "the radiation is due to motions of the virtual particles with the proper mass @xmath33 .",
    "so we may write @xmath45 and consequently @xmath46 here @xmath47 is planck s reduced constant .",
    "in the light of this vision we may imagine that motions of the virtual particles have a weak dispersion around a certain average .",
    "we may guess that the virtual particles on this level undergo collisions with each other like the brownian particles . here",
    "we draw on the hypothesis put forward by edward nelson about aether populated by the brownian sub - particles  @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to the quasi - classical collisions of the brownian sub - particles in our case the diffusion is achieved due to the uncertaintly principle - the collisions induce uncertainty of momenta of the scattered sub - particles  @xcite .",
    "next we proclaim that the pressure @xmath2 consists of sum of two pressures , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . and",
    "the pressure @xmath48 follows from the fick s laws .",
    "the first fick s law says that the diffusion flux , @xmath36 , is proportional to the negative value of the density mass gradient  ( [ eq=4 ] ) .",
    "one can see that the four - laplacian @xmath50 has the dimension of the pressure .",
    "so , we write @xmath51 as for the pressure @xmath49 , one can note first that the kinetic energy of the diffusion flux is @xmath52 .",
    "it means that there exists one more pressure as the kinetic energy per unit volume of the medium in question : @xmath53    now we can see that sum of the two pressures , @xmath54 , divided by @xmath21 ( we remark that @xmath55 ) reduces to the quantum potential @xmath56 here @xmath57 .",
    "when @xmath58 the quantum potential is in complete concordance with that given in  @xcite . on the other hand , when @xmath59 this potential degenerates to the non - relativistic one .",
    "return to eq .",
    "( [ eq=3 ] ) .",
    "since the tensor @xmath60 is symmetric , one can believe that it comes from the scalar field .",
    "after multiplying this equation by @xmath61 and taking into account that @xmath62 we have @xmath63 in front of the second member we write minus inasmuch as @xmath64 .    keeping in mind the klein - gordon equation in perspective",
    "we first multiply eq .",
    "( [ eq=10 ] ) by 2 and suppose that @xmath65 the mass @xmath33 hereinafter is @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the rest mass and @xmath68 . also we write the letter @xmath69 meaning the speed of light , which is adopted as 1 according to our convention",
    ". inasmuch as the superfluid medium is irrotational , the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq=10 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath70 .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq=10 ] ) is as follows @xmath71 here @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the integration constant having dimension of energy . since the superfluid medium under consideration is irrotational , we can express the velocity @xmath74 through the gradient of the scalar field @xmath75 .",
    "the last extra term vanishes as @xmath76 tends to zero ( the relativistic sector ) , but this term will be important in the non - relativistic limit when getting the schrdinger equation .",
    "so , the velocity @xmath74 can be expressed as follows @xmath77 here we need to say some words about the phase @xmath78 .",
    "it comes from the expression @xmath79 describing the time dilation . this phase belonging to the unitary group @xmath80 carries out the timekeeping of the path",
    "@xmath81  @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the timekeeping tends to zero as @xmath76 tends to zero , that is , as @xmath82 .",
    "the energy of the timekeeping is defined as @xmath83 . where @xmath67 is the rest mass .",
    "its contribution disappears as the velocity approaches the speed of light .",

    "the probability density @xmath94 shows distribution of the virtual particles in the vicinity of the 4-point @xmath95 . whereas the action @xmath96 characterizes a degree of mobility of these particles in the same place .",
    "computations done above give a good concurrence with those that have been fulfilled by fiscaletti  @xcite . in his work the quantum hamilton - jacobi equation has a view @xmath97 with the quantum potential defined as @xmath98 + comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq=16 ] ) and  ( [ eq=19 ] ) we find their good concurrence when @xmath99 .",
    "the difference in the quantum potentials  ( [ eq=9 ] ) and  ( [ eq=20 ] ) is due to their individual definitions .",
    "the potential @xmath100 has the dimension of energy , whereas @xmath101 is dimensionless due to dividing by @xmath102 .",
    "opposite signs at the quantum potentials are due the choice of the metric tensors , @xmath103 or @xmath104 , having the opposite signatures @xmath5 and @xmath105 , respectively .      at non - relativistic limit @xmath106 .",
    "it means that @xmath87 converges to unit .",
    "observe that in this limit the third and fourth terms in eq .",

    "we suppose that the viscosity average on time vanishes . but its variance is non - zero .",

    "the problem of finding the quantum potential goes back to fick s laws written down in the relativistic sector .",
    "a main essence of these laws is that they describe currents induced by gradients of the pressures arising in a special superfluid medium - the physical vacuum .",
    "so , the quantum potential describes influence through differences of the pressures that arise between ensembles of virtual particles populating the vacuum .",
    "the equation of the relativistic hydrodynamics when the viscosity term added gives the possibility of describing vortices arising in such a non - perfect fluid .",
    "we proclaim in that regard that averaged in time the viscosity coefficient vanishes , but its dispersion is not zero .",
    "due to this trick , the vortex can live infinitely long and the vortex radius trembles .",
