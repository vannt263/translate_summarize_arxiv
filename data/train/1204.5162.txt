    "[ fig : link ] shows that the energy is a smooth function of parameter @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , the entanglement spectrum remains degenerate in @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "thus we only need nearest - neighbor exchanges to realize the haldane ( @xmath7 ) phase , which leads to the hamiltonian @xmath57 in the main text .",
    "the active operators in tab .  [ tab : spt_d2p ] are obtained as the following . in the hilbert space spanned by the two - fold degenerate edge states , only the pauli matrices",
    "@xmath58 can lift the degeneracy .",
    "but these operators are not physical quantities . we need to find physical spin operators which vary in the same way as these pauli matrices under the symmetry group . in other words , we require that the active operators form the same linear representations as @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "for example , in the @xmath30 projective representation , @xmath59 varies as @xmath60 on the other hand , from tab .",
    "[ tab : linear ] , @xmath61 we find that @xmath62 and @xmath59 belong to the same linear representation @xmath63 under the symmetry operation .",
    "this means that in the low energy limit ( i.e. in the ground state subspace ) , these two operators have similar behavior .",
    "so we can identify @xmath62 as an active operator .",
    "similarly , he operators @xmath64 and @xmath65 are active operators corresponding to @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .    similar to ( [ ex ] ) , we can construct the exactly solvable hamiltonian @xmath68 of the @xmath3 phase .",

    "notice that @xmath75 are not active operators , meaning that the edge states in the ground state will not respond to the uniform magnetic in @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions . to check this result",
    ", we perform a finite - size exact diagonalization of the solvable model @xmath68 . as shown in fig.[fig : bintz ] , only the magnetic field along @xmath4 direction can split the ground state degeneracy .",
    "these properties are valid in the whole @xmath3 phase in thermodynamic limit .",
    "this verifies the conclusion that only @xmath65 is the active operator .",
    "this interesting result indicates that we can distinguish @xmath3 from @xmath7 by the response to magnetic fields . in @xmath7 phase , arbitrarily small magnetic field",
    "can split the degeneracy of the ground states , showing that the edge states carry free magnetic moments .",
    "according to curie s law , the magnetic susceptibility will diverge at low temperature .",
    "but in @xmath3 phase , the edge states only carry magnetic moment in @xmath4 direction , so the magnetic susceptibility within the xy plane does not diverge at low temperature , but it does diverge if the magnetic field is along @xmath4 direction . these results are also verified numerically , see fig .",
    "[ fig : chitz ] .    the behavior of low - temperature magnetic susceptibility is measurable , which allows us to distinguish different spt phases experimentally .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss in more detail the implementation scheme for the hamiltonian with spt phases . to keep our discussion general , we consider a two - dimensional ( 2d ) coupled - harmonic - oscillator - array .",
    "later , we will relate this general scheme to the specific example of a cavity - ladder as in the main text .    consider a 2d array , on each site of the array , two independent harmonic oscillators exist and couple with those on the neighboring sites via energy tunneling .",
    "we label these harmonic oscillators as @xmath76 ( longitudinal ) and @xmath77 ( transverse ) , and assume that oscillators only couple with those having the same label on the neighboring sites along the direction specified by their labels .",
    "this can be achieved by requiring the frequency difference between different types of oscillators ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) to be sufficiently large , and by setting up specific coupling schemes between neighboring sites .",
    "the hamiltonian for this 2d coupled - harmonic - oscillator - array can be written as ( @xmath78=1 ) @xmath79 where @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) is the annihilation operator for the harmonic oscillator labeled @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) on the @xmath82th site transversally and the @xmath83th site longitudinally .",
    "the coupling strength along the longitudinal ( transverse ) direction is given by @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the harmonic oscillators on each site interact with a two - level system @xmath86 , and the coupling rates are @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively .",
