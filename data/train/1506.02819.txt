    "in rotating fluids , the restoring action of the coriolis force allows for the propagation of anisotropic , transverse , circularly polarized waves called inertial waves.@xcite these waves are of fundamental interest for geo- and astrophysical flows:@xcite they can for instance be excited in the fluid core of planets by tidal motions , precession or libration.@xcite internal gravity waves in stratified fluids , relevant to the ocean and the atmosphere , share a number of properties with inertial waves.@xcite internal waves , or mixed internal  inertial waves when rotation and stratification effects are of comparable magnitude,@xcite can also be excited in the ocean by the interaction of tides with topography.@xcite        we focus in this paper on the scaling of the viscous decay of a wave beam emitted by a line source in a uniformly rotating fluid .",
    "although this problem has received much attention , the influence of the multipole order of the source has not been addressed so far .",
    "interestingly , whereas the growth of the wave beam thickness,@xcite @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 the distance from the source ) , is independent of the multipole order of the source , the decay of the wave amplitude depends on which quantity is conserved along the wave beam ( flowrate , momentum , or higher order moment ) , which is directly governed by the multipole order of the source .",
    "such dependence was discussed in the case of internal waves produced by a point source in stratified fluids by voisin.@xcite here we address this problem for a two - dimensional inertial wave beam produced by a line source , extending the simple far - field quasi - parallel approach of cortet _ _ et al.__@xcite to a source of arbitrary multipole order .",
    "we show that the wave decay is steeper as the multipole order of the source increases , which implies that the far - field decay of a wave beam emitted by an arbitrary source is dominated by its lowest multipole component .",
    "inertial wave beams emitted from localized sources are relevant to a broad range of laboratory and natural flows , including local forcing by a wavemaker immersed in the fluid , but also global forcing such as precession , libration or tidal motion acting at the scale of the fluid domain .",
    "this is because in all cases wave beams are emitted from critical lines , where the local slope of the solid boundaries equals the propagation angle of the wave .",
    "along such critical lines the oscillating boundary layer erupts and forms oscillating beams in the bulk of the flow.@xcite in confined fluid domains such beams reflect and , in the presence of sloping boundaries , may focus on wave attractors.@xcite the eruption at critical lines produces two types of wave beams , associated with different magnitudes and scaling laws , propagating in planes tangent and non - tangent to the solid boundary.@xcite wave emission in the tangent plane , developing only along convex boundaries , is stronger : this is the case for conical inertial wave beams emitted from the inner core of a rotating spherical shell,@xcite or for internal wave beams excited by oceanic internal tides on the edge of continental shelves or ridges.@xcite wave emission in the non - tangential plane , both at critical lines of convex or concave slope ( for instance on the outer sphere of a rotating spherical shell@xcite or at the sloping bottom of a ridge@xcite ) , is of weaker amplitude .",
    "emission of inertial wave beams is also observed from horizontal edges in containers such as a cylinder@xcite or a parallelepiped.@xcite    a key property of an inertial wave beam spawned from an erupting boundary layer is its non - zero instantaneous flowrate : it can be modeled in the far field as originating from a monopole line source .",
    "depending on the topology of the fluid domain , in particular on the distribution and relative phases between such elementary monopole sources , different wave beams propagating in the same direction may combine and form far - field beams of either non - zero or zero instantaneous flowrate , therefore corresponding to an effective monopole or a higher order multipole source .",
    "note that such combination of beams requires propagation over a distance much larger than the separation between the sources , a requirement which is usually not satisfied in geo- and astrophysical situations .",
    "we restrict in the following to wave beams produced by effective line sources surrounded by the fluid . in practical situations",
    ", such line source corresponds to a two - dimensional convex disturbance , say a cylinder , defining four critical lines ( fig .",
    "1 ) . if the cylinder is pulsating ( fig .",
    "1a ) , the periodic emission and suction of mass from these critical lines is in phase , so the far - field merged beams have non - zero flowrate : this defines an effective monopole source . on the other hand , if the cylinder is oscillating ( fig .",
    "1b ) , the parent beams propagating in the same direction are out of phase , resulting in far - field merged beams of zero flowrate : this defines an effective dipole source .",
    "the pulsating and oscillating cylinders are therefore generic configurations to investigate the influence of the multipole order of a line source on the properties of the far - field wave beams .",
    "most of the experiments investigating wave beams emitted by a local disturbance , both in stratified@xcite and rotating@xcite fluids , are based on oscillating wavemakers ( with the exception of makarov _",
    "et al._@xcite who report results from a pulsating cylinder in a stratified fluid ) .",
    "the resulting far - field wave beams are therefore distinct from those produced from an erupting boundary layer in a globally forced fluid domain .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to compare the far - field properties of inertial wave beams emitted from a pulsating and an oscillating cylinder in a rotating tank , aiming to produce a monopole and a dipole source .",
    "velocity measurements in the wave beam are achieved using two - camera multi - resolution particle image velocimetry , ensuring a good resolution both in the near and far fields .",
    "the two sources produce distinct decay exponents and wave beam profiles , in good agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the geometrical properties of inertial waves follow from their dispersion relation,@xcite @xmath2 with @xmath3 the wave frequency and @xmath4 the polar angle between the wave vector @xmath5 and the vertical rotation vector @xmath6 .",
    "waves emitted from a localized harmonic disturbance propagate energy in directions making an angle @xmath7 to the horizontal , along two cones for a point source and along four plane beams for a line source normal to @xmath6 .",
    "we restrict in the following to the line source configuration , for which the spatial decay of the wave is purely governed by viscosity . in each wave beam ,",
    "fluid particles describe anticyclonic circular translations in the tilted plane normal to @xmath5 .",
    "since only the orientation of @xmath5 is prescribed by the dispersion relation ( [ eq : dr ] ) but not its magnitude , the characteristic sizes of the wave ( wave length , beam thickness ) are governed by the boundary conditions and viscosity .",
    "the viscous spreading of the wave beam results from the combination of the energy propagation in the longitudinal direction @xmath1 and its diffusion in the lateral direction @xmath8 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : contour ] ) .",
    "its scaling can be obtained from a classical boundary - layer argument : during a time @xmath9 , the wave energy spreads laterally over a distance @xmath10 , with @xmath11 is the kinematic viscosity , and propagates over a distance @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the group velocity . evaluating @xmath14 for",
    "the dominant wave number at a distance @xmath1 from the source , @xmath15 , simply yields @xmath16 where we introduce the viscous scale @xmath17 although the scaling of the wave amplitude strongly depends on the multipole order of the source , the scaling of the beam thickness ( [ eq : del ] ) is independent of the nature of the source , provided that @xmath18 is much larger than the size of the source .",
    "we derive now the similarity solutions for a viscous 2d inertial wave beam emitted by a harmonic line source , focusing on the spatial decay of the wave amplitude and its dependence on the multipole order of the source .",

    "what is needed in addition is to find a conserved quantity involving that moment , and to identify @xmath55 to the multipole order of the source from which the wave beam is emitted .",

    "this bimodal - to - unimodal transition , a classical feature of waves emitted from a source of large extent , has been mainly described for internal waves excited by oscillating disturbances.@xcite figure  [ fig : sketch](a , b ) provides a simple sketch of this transition for a pulsating and an oscillating cylinder of large extent .",
    "the oscillating boundary layer over the cylinder detaches at the four critical lines , where the local slope equals the wave beam angle @xmath4 , forming eight wave beams of non - zero instantaneous flowrate . the far - field beam in a given direction results from the merging of two parent beams propagating along the same direction , that are in phase for the pulsating cylinder and out - of - phase for the oscillating cylinder .",
    "the combination of two in - phase parent beams of order @xmath55 separated by a normalized transverse distance @xmath212 is given by @xmath213 , which far from the source ( @xmath214 ) simply gives a beam of order @xmath55 .",
    "on the other hand , the combination of two out - of - phase parent beams of order @xmath55 is given by @xmath215 , yielding a beam of order @xmath216 : this is consistent with the observation of a far - field wave beam of zero flowrate ( @xmath57 ) emitted from the two nonzero flowrate sources ( @xmath58 ) at the critical lines for the oscillating cylinder .",
    "determining the merging distance @xmath211 requires the full resolution of the flow close to the wavemaker .",
    "this computation is given in hurley and keady@xcite and voisin@xcite for oscillating cylinders and spheres in a stratified fluid .",
    "qualitatively , we can estimate @xmath211 from the spreading law @xmath217 of each parent beam , yielding a merging distance @xmath211 such that @xmath218 given by @xmath219 .",
    "the radius ratio between the pulsating and oscillating cylinders ( @xmath220 and @xmath221  mm , respectively ) indicates that @xmath222 is expected much larger for the pulsating cylinder . for the oscillating cylinder",
    "the predicted merging distance is of order of the cylinder radius , so that the bimodal wave beam can not be observed , which is consistent with the monotonic decay of @xmath206 .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the decay of a two - dimensional inertial wave beam and showed that it is set by the multipole order @xmath66 of the source from which it is emitted .",
    "experimental measurements are reported for sources of the first two orders : monopole ( @xmath223 ) and dipole ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "we find that the structure of the wave beam is well represented by a moore - saffman@xcite ( or thomas - stevenson@xcite ) function of order equal to the multipole order of the source .",
    "the wave envelope decays as a power law of the distance from the source , with an exponent governed by the order of the source ( @xmath224 for the velocity and @xmath225 for the vorticity ) .",
    "these properties , demonstrated here for inertial waves in rotating fluids , should also hold for internal waves in stratified fluids .",
    "the steeper decay of the wave amplitude as the multipole order is increased indicates that the far - field structure of a wave beam is dominated by the lowest order of the source , i.e. by its first nonzero moment ( flowrate , momentum or higher order moment ) . in most practical situations ,",
    "the nature of the source can be discriminated by its instantaneous flowrate , either nonzero for a monopole source or zero for a dipole or higher order source .",
    "this means that a wave beam emitted from any source of nonzero instantaneous flowrate must be dominated in the far field by its monopole component .",
    "such monopole sources are relevant to most natural flows ( e.g. conical wave beams in the fluid core of planets , internal tide generation over ocean topography ) : the detachment of the oscillating boundary layers at the critical lines produces oscillating jets in the bulk , corresponding to a weak spatial decay . on the other hand , oscillating disturbances immersed in the fluid ( a typical configuration of most laboratory experiments in rotating or stratified fluids ) produce in the far field beams of zero instantaneous flowrate , resulting in a stronger spatial decay",
