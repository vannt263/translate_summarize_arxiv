    "since the beginning of the 20th century the stability of fluid flows has been studied in unlike systems .",
    "typical examples of such systems are natural convection in the atmosphere or convection in the earth mantle and the rayleigh - bnard convection when a thin layer of fluid is heated from below @xcite .",
    "when flow instabilities arise in these systems during the transition to turbulence often turbulent rolls appear that are also referred to as convection cells .",
    "+ the shear flow of a thin fluid layer that is studied here also falls into this group of systems that display turbulent rolls often called taylor vortices when the turbulent regime is reached .",
    "+ the most prominent setup to study the instability of a sheared thin fluid layer is the circular taylor couette cell . in this setup two",
    "coaxial mounted cylinders with a small difference in radii rotate independently at different angular frequencies .",
    "the small difference in the cylinders radii leaves a thin gap that is filled with a fluid .",
    "different angular frequencies cause a shear of the fluid layer .",
    "centrifugal forces act on the fluid layer between the cylinder in this situation .",
    "this centrifugal forces depend on the radial position and on the angular frequencies of the cylinders .",
    "for some combinations of the angular frequencies and cylinder radii the resulting centrifugal forces give rise to an instability of the steady rotary flow .",
    "the instability leads to toroidal taylor vortices or rolls that are again stable in time and space .",
    "these vortices are arranged in a periodic manner along the cylinders as described in @xcite and studied in @xcite .",
    "+ in more recent experiments it was shown that coriolis forces can as well lead to periodic flow patterns in shear flows as shown and discussed in @xcite . in this work a planar couette cell ( see fig.[fig : expsetup ] and @xcite ) was mounted on a rotating table with an angular frequency controlled independently from the shear velocity of the flow channel .",
    "the coriolis force was then introduced by controlling the rotational frequency and direction of the table .",
    "these experiments show that the coriolis force leads to a similar instability and patterns as the centrifugal force in the circular taylor couette cell .",
    "in fact in @xcite a great variety of flow patterns emerged during the transition to the turbulent regime depending on the shear velocity and the coriolis force .",
    "weather the turbulent flow pattern are stable or meta stable in time and space at a fixed shear velocity depends on the direction and frequency of the table rotation .",
    "+ in both above setups the most simple configuration of turbulent flow patterns are rolls that span through the whole flow channel in the stream direction .",
    "such rolls are stacked on top of each other in a periodic manner where neighboring rolls rotate counter - wise and move in the opposite stream - wise direction .",
    "the streamlines in such a roll cell resemble a helix .",
    "the helices are stacked one above another in the stream - wise direction with alternating helix axis direction but same chirality .",
    "+ the turbulent patterns originate from small perturbations of the flow that grow exponentially in time and lead to steady flow patterns under the above discussed conditions .",
    "when neither centrifugal nor coriolis forces are present the turbulent patterns lose their stability and become meta stable .",
    "this is the case in the setup that is studied in the present work .",
    "+ it is the main purpose of the present paper to quantify and describe the patterns that result as the stabilizing mechanisms of the fictitious forces are removed .",
    "we achieve this through a statistical analysis of the flow in terms of velocity correlation functions and velocity probability distributions .",
    "the resulting flow patterns are characterized by stream - wise vortices with alternating stream - wise flow direction between neighboring vortices .",
    "+ in simulations and analytical work of this setup by @xcite meta stable elongated turbulent rolls have been reported and studied . in further investigations",
    "a low - order model is used to investigate self - sustaining rolls and effects of the boundary conditions in @xcite and admissible fluids states and traveling wave solutions of the navier - stokes equation are simulated in @xcite .",
    "+ coexistence of laminar and turbulent regions where investigated numerically by @xcite .",
    "further the flow in a plane couette cell was characterized into four flow regimes by @xcite using direct numerical simulations . in preceding experiments of the planar taylor couette cell a rheoscopic ( aka kalliroscopic ) fluid was sheared and pictures of the patterns taken @xcite .",
    "fluid injection into the flow creates turbulent spots which were studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "in addition in @xcite the flow patterns in a planar couette cell close to a wire spanning the cell parallel to the walls were investigated experimentally by the use of different techniques such as laser doppler velocimetry and rheoscopic particles . when the reynolds number is used as the control parameter and suddenly decreased in quench experiments the decay time of vortex structures have been measured in experiments by @xcite and experiments are compared to numerical simulations in @xcite .",
    "the interaction between thermal convection and shear flows in a plane couette cell is studied through numerical simulations in @xcite .",
    "+ using these method periodic and elongated flow structures along the stream direction could be visualized and studied .",
    "compared to taylor vortices found in circular cells these patterns in a planar couette cell are much shorter in the stream direction and fluctuate in time and space . + to achieve a direct measurement of the flow velocity we decided to use a correlation image velocimetry technique ( civ ) . for this purpose tracer particles with the same mass density as the sheared fluid",
    "are added to the fluid .",
    "adding density matched tracer particles is a standard non invasive technique .",
    "this technique allows a direct measurement of the fluid velocity that reveals additional characteristic features of the flow patterns which were not accessible using the previous techniques where only the flow direction was visualized @xcite .",

    "the film has a height of @xmath7 cm in the @xmath8-direction , an inner separation distance @xmath9 mm in the @xmath10-direction , over a length of @xmath11 cm along the @xmath4-direction .",
    "furthermore , the flow channel is made of plexiglas to ensure light transparency .",
    "the mylar film was sealed as a belt , with a joint without overlap .",
    "the boundary conditions are open to the rolls on the sides and closed to top and bottom of the cell .",
    "turbulence arises first at the sides of the cell due to the noise induced by the rolls as shown with rheoscopic particles during experiments in the same cell by @xcite .",
    "+ the initial preparation of the couette cell is done by the following routine : 1 ) the cell is filled with water , 2 ) three drops of liquid soap are added only to prevent particle aggregation and clustering by reducing the surface tension ( this has no effect on the experiments otherwise ) , 3 ) @xmath12 grams of fluorescent polyethylene tracer particles ( cospheric fluorescent red ) with diameter @xmath13 m are added to the water .",

    "for this reason velocity values are not symmetric around @xmath73 mm .",
    "+ in all plots it could also been observed that in the turbulent regime at higher reynolds numbers the anticorrelation of the flow decreased .",

    "the main flow velocity of all vortices is equally distributed in positive and negative @xmath4-direction in a time and space average this is also shown in simulations @xcite . + in a second step we studied how the main @xmath4-flow velocity inside a vortex is influenced by the film boundaries in @xmath10-direction .",
    "in @xmath10-direction each vortex is confined by the two sides of the film .",
    "there is always one side that moves along with the main @xmath4-flow direction of the vortex and the other film side that moves against the main @xmath4-flow direction of the vortex . when moving in @xmath10-direction from the middle between the film towards the film side that moves along with the main @xmath4-flow direction the @xmath51-velocity inside a vortex increases . when moving to the other side from the middle between the film towards the film side that moves against with the main @xmath4-flow direction the @xmath51-velocity inside a vortex decreases",

    "how this shear profile looks in detail when crossing the vortex in @xmath10-direction can not be stated exactly from the measurements discussed in this article .",
    "the precise profile shown in the figures is therefore a guess that fulfills the above discussed conditions .",
