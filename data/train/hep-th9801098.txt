    "the ising model is widely used for illustrating concepts in statistical mechanics and field theory . in 2-dimensions",
    "it is exactly solvable and provides the classic example of a theory which exhibits non - mean - field critical exponents .",
    "there are three representations of the model : that as a magnetic spin system , as a theory of random paths @xcite-@xcite and as a fermionic lattice field theory with gaussian action ( grassmann representation ) @xcite",
    ". the connections between these are interesting , since they illustrate a deep relationship between dynamics and geometry .",
    "the random paths can be thought of as euclidean world lines of the fermions and in turn as domain boundaries in the spin system .",
    "even more fascinating are the corresponding relationships in the 3-@xmath0 ising model .",
    "the 3-@xmath0 model is not exactly solvable .",
    "however , it does share some of the geometrical features of the 2-@xmath0 model .",
    "its partition function can be represented as a spin model , as a model of decorated random surfaces @xcite-@xcite and as a fermionic lattice model which is no longer gaussian @xcite .",
    "there is an intriguing suggestion @xcite that the continuum limit of the 3-@xmath0 ising model could be some sort of non - critical string theory .",
    "the precise form of such a string theory is yet unknown .",
    "even the representation in terms of lattice surfaces ( or loops ) remains to be completely understood .",
    "in particular the calculus of surfaces ( loops ) is rather cumbersome to work with . handling the symmetry and geometry factors in the loop and surface representations is a non - trivial problem",
    ". it would be desirable to have an exact algebraic representation of the geometrical objects . in this article",
    "we shall show that such an algebraic representation can be obtained from the hopping expansion ( see e.g. @xcite ) of the grassmann representation of the model .",
    "we obtain several new results which serve to demonstrate the power of this calculus .    the language of the hopping expansion allows for a simple algebraic formulation of the combinatorics of surfaces and loops .",
    "in particular all geometric factors are obtained as traces of ordered products of the hopping generators (= generators of shifts on the lattice ) .",
    "also , counting problems which correspond to some symmetries of the geometric objects , such as iteration of loops ( i.e. the loop runs through its links several times ) can be tackled in a simple manner . as an application of the latter we shall give the corrected version of the loop expansion of the free energy in the 2-@xmath0 case .",
    "it differs from previous results by extra factors for iterated loops .",
    "also the computation of the radius of convergence of loop- or surface expansion is a rather intractable problem if one has to work with the geometrical objects . for the 2-@xmath0 case",
    "we show that our calculus reduces this problem to the computation of the norm of the hopping matrix .",
    "for the 3-@xmath0 case we derive a representation of the 3-@xmath0 ising model as a product of 2-@xmath0 ising models coupled to an auxiliary field .",
    "based on this representation we give an elegant derivation of the geometric factor which eliminates overcounting of surfaces .",
    "our approach also allows for a simple classification of surfaces to be summed over in the surface representation .",
    "we show that this classification can be reduced to a 2-dimensional problem : the surfaces can be characterized by the loops that emerge as intersections of the surfaces with the coordinate planes of the lattice",
    ". there is some freedom in the choice of admissible loops in these planes .",
    "different choices lead to different classes of surfaces . for both 2- and 3-@xmath0",
    "we derive an elegant formula for 2@xmath1-point functions in terms of loops and surfaces , respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 1.2 we review the representations of the ising model in terms of loops ( 2-@xmath0 ) and surfaces ( 3-@xmath0 ) and introduce our conventions .",
    "section 2 is dedicated to the 2-@xmath0 case . in 2.1",
    "we set up the grassmann representation and perform the hopping expansion .",
    "this is followed by sub - section 2.2 where we show how to obtain the representation in terms of loops from the hopping expansion and show that the latter is an exact , algebraic representation of the loop calculus .",
    "the radius of convergence of the loop expansion of the free energy is shown to be determined by the critical temperature in 2.3 .",
    "section 3 gives our results for the 3-@xmath0 case . in 3.1",
    "we first decompose the quartic term in the grassmann representation by introducing an auxiliary field and set up the hopping expansion . in 3.2",
    "we extract the surface picture from the hopping expansion , derive the geometric factors and discuss the above mentioned classification of surfaces . in sub - section 3.3",
    "we derive the formula for the 2@xmath1-point functions in terms of surfaces ( loops ) .",
    "the article closes with a discussion in section 4 .",
    "since we will make extensive use of the representation of the partition function in terms of loops and surfaces we will review these representations here and introduce our conventions .    the ising model in terms of spin variables has the partition function @xmath2 where @xmath3 runs over all sites of the @xmath0-dimensional lattice @xmath4zz@xmath5 ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 denotes nearest neighbors .",
    "the 2-@xmath0 partition function has a representation in terms of closed loops @xcite-@xcite,@xcite on the dual lattice @xmath8 ( for the square lattice @xmath9 ) .",
    "this representation is obtained by drawing closed loops @xmath10 on the dual lattice around patches of negative spins on the original lattice . each link in @xmath10 crosses a link of the original lattice which has anti - aligned spins at its endpoints . by drawing loops around all such patches",
    "every anti - aligned link is taken into account .",
    "each of these links has a boltzmann weight exp@xmath11 , and since the total length @xmath12 of all loops is equal the number of anti - aligned neighbors , this gives rise to the weight exp@xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath14 denotes the number of all sites , there remain @xmath15 links with aligned spins at the endpoints .",
    "they have boltzmann weight exp@xmath16 and one finds @xmath17 here we introduced @xmath18 exp@xmath11 .",
    "the factor 2 emerges , since every loop configuration corresponds to 2 spin configurations related by the zz@xmath19 symmetry of the model .",
    "@xmath20 is defined to be the set of closed loops ( not necessarily connected ) which can be obtained by drawing lines on the dual lattice around patches of negative spins , so that a curve @xmath10 in @xmath20 is given by a collection of links that have no boundary .",
    "this defines loops by their so - called _",
    "extrinsic geometry_. the series ( [ z2ext ] ) will converge for small @xmath21 , hence is a low temperature expansion ( the convergence properties will be discussed in section 2.3 ) .",
    "it is known that the partition function can also be written in terms of loops which have intrinsic geometry : @xmath22 here we introduced the number of self - intersections @xmath23 of a loop @xmath10 .",
    "we define @xmath24 to be the set of all closed , not necessarily connected , loops @xmath10 on the dual lattice with a fixed chosen orientation and with the restriction that each of the links of @xmath10 is occupied only once .",
    "the loops may however intersect themselves or each other .",
    "thus a loop @xmath10 in @xmath24 consists of a base point ( or several base points when there are disconnected pieces ) and a set of directions with the above restrictions .",
    "this is what we refer to as loops with _",
    "intrinsic geometry_.    a representation of the partition function in terms of loops with intrinsic geometry is a powerful tool , since it allows to exponentiate the sum over loops in ( [ z2int ] ) .",
    "this gives an expression of the free energy in terms of loops .",
    "we will discuss the precise form of this representation later in detail .",
    "the density of the free energy is a well defined physical quantity also in the infinite volume limit , and its representation in terms of loops is a beautiful illustration of the interplay between dynamics and geometry .",
    "there is a canonical mapping from @xmath24 onto @xmath20 , with the image of a loop @xmath25 under this mapping given by the collection of links traced out by that loop @xmath25 .",
    "obviously there exist many loops in @xmath24 with distinct intrinsic geometries which get mapped to a single loop in @xmath20 .",
    "however , the self - intersection factor @xmath26 leads to a cancellation of this over - counting in the sum ( [ z2int ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ selfinter ] .",
    "every pinch structure of a loop in @xmath20 ( as depicted in fig .",
    "[ selfinter ] , left - hand side ) is the image of each of the three pieces of loops in @xmath24 shown on the right - hand side of the figure .",
    "= 0.8 in    note that larger classes of loops than @xmath24 can be used to represent the ising model .",
    "for example , the restriction that links are occupied only once in a loop can be relaxed to the restriction that the loops are non - back - tracking , i.e.  they must not turn around at a site and run back on their last link .",
    "again , the same self - intersection factor @xmath26 gives rise to the necessary cancellations .",
    "however , for our presentation the above definition of @xmath24 is most convenient .",
    "+ it is straightforward to generalize ( [ z2int ] ) to the case of the variable bond ising model , where the coupling @xmath27 is allowed to vary over links @xmath7 .",
    "the generalization of ( [ z2int ] ) to the case of the variable bond model is given by @xmath28 here we have generalized @xmath21 to @xmath29 exp@xmath30 and @xmath31 denotes the collection of links on the original lattice dual to the loop @xmath10 .",
    "all of these representations can be generalized to the 3-@xmath0 case .",
    "the representation analogous to ( [ z2ext ] ) is given by a sum over random surfaces with extrinsic geometry , @xmath32 here @xmath33 denotes all closed , but not necessarily connected surfaces @xmath34 made from plaquettes on the dual lattice which can be obtained by enclosing lumps of negative spins in the surface @xmath34 .",
    "analogous to the 2-@xmath0 case the surface @xmath34 in @xmath33 is a collection of plaquettes with zero boundary .",
    "we introduced the notation @xmath35 for the area of the surface @xmath34 .    also for the 3-@xmath0 case one",

    "it is given by @xmath36 here @xmath37 denotes the number of links where the surface self - intersects . again",
    "different choices for the set @xmath38 of surfaces with intrinsic geometry are possible",
    ". we will be more explicit on the possible choices of @xmath38 in section 3 , where we also give an elegant proof of formula ( [ z3int ] ) .",
    "in this section we discuss the 2-dimensional case . this serves to outline the general strategy for the hopping expansion , to introduce some notation and we also obtain results that will be needed for the 3-@xmath0 case .",
    "finally we give the correct result for the loop expansion of the free energy ( exponentiation formula ) which contains an additional factor for iterated loops which has previously been overlooked in the literature .",

    "the subscripts @xmath42 and @xmath43 refer to the elements : lines , corners and monomers of the loops as they are produced by the corresponding terms in the action .",
    "these building blocks give the extrinsic geometry loops in the following way : a line coming into a site has to have a partner going out .",
    "this property of having a partner is enforced by the integration rules for grassmann variables .",
    "the outgoing line can continue in the direction of the incoming line , in this case the grassmann integral is saturated by the monomer term .",
    "the outgoing line can also turn by @xmath44 in which case the grassmann integral is made non - vanishing by the corner terms .",
    "the line can however not turn back since the square of a grassmann variable vanishes .",
    "finally there is the possibility that 4 lines are attached to a site and so saturate the grassmann integral .",
    "this gives rise to the pinch structure already discussed above .",
    "thus the loops produced by the expansion of ( [ zferm2d ] ) are closed ( every incoming line has an outgoing partner ) and non - back - tracking ( square of the grassmann variable vanishes ) .",

    "[ redex ] the sub - loop is removed using the intersection rule ( [ intersection ] ) and an overall factor of @xmath88 emerges .",

    "it is possible to simplify the exponential in ( [ expsum1 ] ) even further : to do that we discuss ( in order of increasing complexity ) loops with singly occupied links , iterated loops where the whole set of links is run through several times and finally loops where only some links are occupied several times . to start take some loop @xmath10 in @xmath97 where each link in the loop is occupied only once",

    "each of these points can serve as the base point for a different loop giving rise to the same contribution to ( [ expsum1 ] ) as @xmath10 .",
    "as such , one can choose a single representative of this class of loops and remove the factor of @xmath99 in ( [ expsum1 ] ) .",

    "we stress that this result differs from previous formulas for the exponentiation of ( [ z2int ] ) by the factor @xmath103 for iterated loops .",
    "this factor is , however , essential for the correct cancellation of loops that have no counterpart in @xmath20 .",
    "this can be seen by the following simple example : consider the basic loop of length 4 which runs around a plaquette .",
    "when the exponent in ( [ expsum2 ] ) is expanded , this loop will , in the quadratic term of the expansion , give rise to the plaquette which is occupied by two such loops running around this single plaquette ( see the left - hand side of fig .",

    "it has the factor @xmath107 , where the factor 1/2 comes from the expansion of the exponential function .",
    "this loop has no counterpart in @xmath20 and thus has to be cancelled by some other loop .",
    "it is clear that the only loop which can cancel this loop is the one depicted on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ example ] .",
    "it appears in the linear term of the expansion of the exponential function and comes with the factor @xmath108 and thus exactly cancels the first loop .",
    "the overall minus sign is due to the self - intersection and the factor 1/2 comes from the term @xmath109 .",
    "hence this factor is essential for the cancellation of unphysical loops .",
    "= 0.6 in    with the derivation of ( [ expsum2 ] ) we have established that the hopping expansion ( [ hopexp ] ) of the grassmann formulation gives an exact algebraic representation of the loop expansion .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize ( [ expsum2 ] ) to the case of the variable bond ising model by running through the derivation once more but allowing for varying boltzmann factors @xmath29 exp@xmath30 .",
    "the result is ( neglecting the overall factor @xmath110 ) : @xmath111 we remark that when a loop @xmath10 occupies some links several times , its dual @xmath31 has multiply occupied links .",

    "it is simple to see the independence of ( [ npoint ] ) from the choice of @xmath214 : the network @xmath214 can be deformed arbitrarily by adding single plaquettes to @xmath214 and since a plaquette always intersects an even number of times ( 0 , 2 or 4-times ) with a given surface , the intersection term @xmath241 remains invariant under such deformations .",
    "we finally remark , that the same formula holds if one works with the representation in terms of surfaces with intrinsic geometry ( certainly the self - intersection factor @xmath209 has to be re - inserted ) .",
    "the formula also holds in 2-@xmath0 , when the surfaces @xmath34 are replaced by the loops @xmath10 .",
