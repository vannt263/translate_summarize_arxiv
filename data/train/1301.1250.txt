    "relativistic runaway electron populations have been frequently observed in various plasmas , e.g. large tokamak disruptions @xcite , electric discharges associated with thunderstorms @xcite and solar flares @xcite .",
    "runaway electrons are produced when the electric field is larger than a certain critical field ( @xmath0 ) , and the accelerating force overwhelms the friction for high energy electrons .",
    "the anisotropy of the runaway electron distribution can lead to destabilization of electromagnetic waves through wave - particle resonant interaction .",
    "several studies have shown that the velocity anisotropy excites electromagnetic waves mainly through the anomalous doppler resonance @xcite . once the instability is triggered the distribution is isotropized due to pitch - angle scattering .",
    "previous work @xcite has considered whistler wave instability driven by an anisotropic electron distribution as a possible cause for the observed magnetic field threshold for runaway generation in large tokamaks @xcite .",
    "these calculations relied on a distribution function that was based on an approximate solution of the kinetic equation in the case when the electric field is well above the critical field , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the thermal electron density , @xmath4 is the electron rest mass , @xmath5 is the electron charge , @xmath6 is the coulomb logarithm , @xmath7 is the dielectric constant and @xmath8 is the speed of light . also , in many studies , the runaway electrons were assumed to be ultra - relativistic ( velocities within @xmath9 to the speed of light ) and simplified resonance conditions were used to describe the wave - particle interaction . however , the electric field is not always much larger than the critical field and the velocity of the electrons is often not that close to the speed of light .",
    "an example of this is the observations of superthermal electron populations in the t-10 tokamak during magnetic reconnection events , when the electric field was transiently larger than the critical field during the reconnection ( for about @xmath10 ) but then it dropped to values near or even below the critical field @xcite .",
    "recent work @xcite has shown that even in disruptions the electric field in the core region of the plasma is only slightly above the critical electric field , @xmath11 .",
    "the purpose of this work is to determine what waves could be destabilized by runaway beams in a near - critical field .",
    "investigating the lowest relevant limit of the electric field when runaway production occurs is a step toward generalizing the analysis of the runaway electron driven instabilities to lower electric fields .",
    "this way we can gain confidence that the analysis of the wave - particle interaction yields valid results in both the high electric field and the near - critical limit , before proceeding to the numerical analysis of the interaction for electric fields in between .    in the present work we use the runaway distribution derived in reference  @xcite , appropriate for a near - critical field , to calculate the instability growth rate of these waves and",
    "determine the frequencies and wave numbers of the most unstable waves for various parameters .",
    "we use a general resonance condition , without the ultra - relativistic assumption , so the model can be applied also for electrons with lower energies .",
    "we show that the whistler branch is destabilized via the anomalous doppler and cherenkov resonances .",
    "increasing magnetic field leads to increasing wave number and frequency while decreasing propagation angle for the most unstable wave .",
    "the observation of these waves could help to determine the origin and evolution of the energetic electrons .",
    "if the waves grow to significant amplitude they may contribute to efficient transport of particles out from the plasma .",

    "in contrast to the electron - whistler wave , the growth rate has a well - defined maximum . however , as it was mentioned before , the resonance condition can not be satisfied in the region close to the maximum growth rate unless the resonant energy is very high ( around 10 mev for the parameters given in the figure caption ) , which is only expected to be reached by few electrons in the near - critical case considered in this paper .",

    "the reason is that the resonance condition is highly dependent on the magnetic field through the gyrofrequency . due to this fact , the @xmath186 condition for the momentum of the runaway electrons yields very different wave numbers for the most unstable wave .",
    "for example , if the magnetic field is @xmath187 t instead of the @xmath188 t on figure [ fig : most_unstable ] , the @xmath189 resonant momentum yields @xmath190 @xmath183 wave number and @xmath191 . therefore , by increasing the magnetic field , the wave number and frequency of the most unstable wave increase , while the angle of propagation decreases .",
    "the wave number , propagation angle and frequency of the most unstable wave also depend on the maximum runaway energy .",
    "figure [ fig : stability1 ] shows that as the energy grows the propagation angle becomes larger and the wave number and frequency drops .",
    "this means that for low energy runaway electrons ( energies just above the critical energy for runaway acceleration ) we expect frequencies slightly less than half of the electron cyclotron frequency , propagating angles of @xmath192 and wave numbers of 1000 @xmath49 .",
    "as the runaway energy grows the frequency and wave number of the most unstable wave falls .",
    "in order to determine the stability limits , the instability growth rate of the wave has to be compared to the damping rates . in cold plasmas , collisional damping is dominant , and the damping is approximately equal to @xmath193 @xcite , where @xmath194 is the electron - ion collision time .",
    "in addition to collisional damping , the wave is damped due to the fact that the extent of the runaway beam is finite , and the wave energy is transported out of its region with a @xmath195 perpendicular group velocity .",
    "this mechanism can be accounted for by adding a convective damping term @xmath196 , where @xmath197 is the radius of the runaway beam @xcite .",
    "the linear growth rate of a wave is thus @xmath198 , and the wave is unstable , if @xmath199 .",
    "a simple estimate of the order of magnitude of the damping rates shows that for typical parameters , and for reasonably narrow electron beams , the convective damping is expected to dominate if @xmath200 .",

    "is calculated ( for @xmath175 , @xmath176 , then adding them for all @xmath36 and @xmath19 ) , then the collisional and convective damping rates are subtracted from it .",
    "the parameters of the most unstable wave are then determined .",
    "the stability threshold of the most unstable electron - whistler wave is shown on figure  [ fig : stability]a .",
    "we conclude that for typical parameters the runaway density needed to counter the damping rates , therefore to destabilize an electron - whistler wave is of the order of @xmath207 @xmath172 or @xmath208 . for the magnetosonic - whistler wave ,",
    "the stability threshold is shown in figure  [ fig : stability]b . in this case",
    "we assumed @xmath203 , since in this case the resonant particles have higher energies than in the electron - whistler case .",
    "figure [ fig : stability]cd shows the dependence of the stability threshold on the normalized electric field @xmath97 .",
    "we conclude that above @xmath209 , the runaway density needed for destabilization is sensitive to @xmath97 , for higher normalized electric field lower runaway density is needed to destabilize the wave .",
    "this dependence on @xmath97 is due to the fact that for a higher electric field the anisotropy of the runaway distribution and thus the destabilizing effect is stronger , therefore a lower density of runaways suffices for a resonant destabilization of the wave .",
    "this is by no means because of the special characteristics of the model distribution we used , but is due to the underlying physics .",
    "it is instructive to compare the order of magnitude of the runaway density required for destabilization of the whistler wave to the one that is measured in an experimental setup .",
    "figure  [ fig : stability_t10 ] shows the stability thresholds as function of magnetic field , for various runaway beam radii , for parameters relevant to an experiment in the t-10 tokamak @xcite .",
    "we note that the runaway density needed for destabilization is about @xmath210 even for a narrow runaway beam .",
    "the runaway density estimated in the experiment was almost an order of magnitude higher than this : @xmath211 .    , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the presence of high energy electrons is often associated with bursts of high - frequency waves .",
    "the emission of radiation is most often due to bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation , but in certain cases they are due to instabilities caused by the anisotropy .",
    "the observation of these waves can help to determine the origin and evolution of the energetic electrons , and also in some cases , the properties of the background plasma @xcite .",
    "the instability may result in pitch - angle scattering induced isotropization and may therefore prevent the harmful effects of the runaway electron beam @xcite .",
    "the reason for the generation of an anisotropic runaway electron population is the high electric field that is often caused by reconnection events in magnetized plasmas . in previous calculations regarding waves driven by runaways the electric field",
    "was assumed to be much higher than the critical field @xmath1 .",
    "this is not often the case in reality .",
    "therefore , in this paper we use an electron distribution function that is valid in the near - critical case .",
    "we show that in this case , the distribution is broader and less rapidly decaying compared to the @xmath1 case .    by studying the linear growth rate of the electron - whistler branch ( valid in the frequency region @xmath216 ) and the magnetosonic - whistler branch ( valid in the frequency region @xmath217 ) separately , we find that the frequency of the most unstable wave is in the region where these overlap and have characteristics similar to the whistler approximation . for typical tokamak parameters",
    "we find that the frequency of the most unstable wave is around @xmath218 , in the near - critical case with @xmath102 and @xmath219 .",
    "the frequency and wave number of the most unstable wave depends strongly on the magnetic field and on the maximum runaway energy . by comparing the ultra - relativistic limit of the resonance condition and the general one",
    "we show that although the behaviour of the instability growth rates of the electron - whistler and magnetosonic - whistler waves are similar , the actual values for the growth rate may differ , and therefore the frequency and wave number of the most unstable wave might be different .",
    "the instability growth rate of the electron - whistler wave was compared to the collisional and convective damping rates .",
    "we find that the number density of runaways that is required to destabilize the waves increases with increasing magnetic field . for low magnetic fields the convective damping decreases , while the collisional damping rate remains constant , making it dominant in this region .",
    "as the growth rate also decreases , the stability limit is high for low magnetic fields .",
    "we investigated the stability of the whistler waves for parameters relevant to the t-10 tokamak @xcite , where the effective electric field is near - critical .",
    "we found that the observed runaway density is about an order of magnitude higher than the density needed for the most unstable electron - whistler wave to be destabilized .",
    "thus the runaway population may indeed give rise to this whistler wave .",
    "the importance of this study is that it considers the case where the electric field is near critical , which is opposite to the other limit that has been considered in previous work @xcite ( when the electric field is far above the critical ) . by investigating this case ,",
    "we show that the high - frequency instabilities are qualitatively similar , but have different frequencies and wave numbers .",
    "this result may open up the possibility of diagnostics .",
    "understanding the properties of the waves destabilized by runaway electrons can be important in view of obtaining information about the energetic electron population and the background plasma .",
    "regardless of the fact that the distribution used in this work is only valid in the near - critical case , if we compare it to the avalanche distribution we observe a smooth transition between the two , and so we expect that the distribution does not change qualitatively . also , the characteristics of the growth rates in the near - critical and high electric field limits are similar , in the sense that the maximum of the growth rate is at low wave numbers and near - perpendicular propagation in both cases @xcite .",
    "the differences in the parameters of the most unstable wave for near - critical and avalanching cases are mainly due to the maximum runaway energy .",
    "the similarity of the results , added to the relaxation of the approximations used in previous work , opens the way toward more general numerical studies of wave - particle interaction for arbitrary electric fields .",
    "the whistler waves , if they grow to significant amplitude , in principle could perturb the background magnetic field and lead to efficient transport of particles ( specially energetic ones ) out from the plasma . the effect of magnetic field perturbation has been studied before @xcite , and it has been shown that runaway avalanches can be prevented altogether with sufficiently strong radial diffusion .",
    "however , the magnetic fluctuation level that is required for this to happen is estimated to be @xmath220 and the magnetic fluctuation level induced by these high - frequency whistler waves would be several orders of magnitude lower than this value . therefore , as mentioned before , the runaway electron population will be affected mostly through pitch - angle scattering and concomitant isotropization and synchrotron radiation damping .",
