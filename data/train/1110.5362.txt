    "while the internal dynamical evolution of star clusters is mainly driven by relaxation processes , the global galactic environment in which they are hosted can drive their evolution externally .",
    "different aspects of star cluster evolution in the gravitational field of galaxies have been studied numerously using numerical simulations .",
    "recent direct @xmath0-body simulations include the effects of the galactic tidal field @xcite and dynamical friction terms for clusters close to the galactic centre @xcite . from such kind of simulations",
    "the picture emerged that star clusters steadily loose stars through the lagrangian points in the system and form long tidal tails . in axisymmetric potentials the stars in these tails are found to follow orbits which can be approximated by epicycles , resulting in a cycloidal motion of stars along the tails when seen in the tidal tail coordinate system as introduced by @xcite .",
    "this results in the formation of sub - structures within the tidal tails in form of clumps , often referred to as _",
    "epicyclic over - densities_. numerical simulations have also shown that such structures persist also in tails of star clusters on non - circular orbits , however , their local density and position with respect to the cluster in this case vary with time @xcite .",
    "a detailed understanding of the formation , morphology and dynamics of tidal tails resulting from tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies and star clusters in galaxies are of great interest to observations especially in the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "tidal streams are of particular interest for tracing the gravitational potential by reconstruction the orbits of the clusters , as e.g. , for palomar5 @xcite .",
    "the underlying assumption for this method is that the tidal tails accurately trace the cluster orbit @xcite .",
    "the galactic potentials used in numerical simulations such as the ones mentioned above are usually confined to sphericity or axisymmetry for simplicity .",
    "however , disc galaxies such as the milky way show a variety of morphological and dynamical sub - structures that are known to affect the evolution of star clusters .",
    "e.g. , the effect of interactions with giant molecular clouds and spiral arm passages on the cluster dissolution time - scale has been studied by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    in this work",
    "we focus on the evolution of star clusters in the time - dependent gravitational potential of barred disc galaxies .",
    "stellar bars are known to be the main internal driver of disc galaxy evolution and are strong non - linear perturbations to the gravitational potential of disc galaxies , thus having strong effects on the underlying orbital structure in both 2-d and 3-d .",

    "there are alternative direct @xmath0-body codes freely available with more advanced features , such as regularisation methods for an accurate integration of binaries , stellar evolutionary tracks for single and binary stars , etc . however , the present work is the first to study star cluster evolution in barred galaxies and therefore we restrict ourselves to relatively simple models .",
    "simulations with higher resolution , particle mass functions and increasingly more input physics will be studied in the future .    in order to prevent the formation of stellar binaries or multiples in our simulations",

    "we also neglect the dynamical friction between the star cluster and the galaxy , which generally becomes important close to the galactic centre .",

    "further discussion of the tails and of the corresponding @xmath78 distributions will be given elsewhere ( athanassoula , rmero - gomez and berentzen , in prep . ) .",
    "stellar streams are fossils of the formation history of galaxies and can be used to reconstruct , e.g. , the shape of the gravitational potential of dark matter halos .",
    "several issues such as the life - time of the clusters and their tidal streams however are not yet fully understood .",
    "the understanding of the morphology and the dynamics of the tails and their sub - structures is still in its infancy .",
    "numerical @xmath0-body simulations are a main key to address these questions .",
    "many simulations in the literature focus on the evolution of dense stellar systems in an external axisymmetric potential on both circular and eccentric orbits , respectively . for orbits close to the galactic plane , however , non - axisymmetric perturbations in the disk , such as stellar bars and/or spiral arms , are expected to significantly influence the dynamical evolution of star clusters .    in this work",
    "we have presented a set of direct @xmath0-body simulations of star clusters orbiting in the plane of a barred galaxy potential .",
    "the clusters are placed in the mid - plane of the galactic disc and launched on periodic orbits which have been selected from the main planar 2-d families .",
    "the results are then compared to the evolution of star clusters on circular orbits in an axisymmetric potential .",
    "we find that the star clusters dissolve due to the tidal force field of the galaxy  in both the axisymmetric as well as in the barred potential .",
    "while the tidal tails in the axisymmetric potential continuously grow in length , we find a periodic compression and expansion of the tails for star clusters in the barred potential .",
    "both the length and the density of the tidal tails vary with time and are directly correlated to orbital period of the underlying parental orbit .",
    "we find sub - structures within the tidal tails in form of clumps ( or epicyclic over - densities ) .",
    "the qualitative evolution of these structures is in agreement with the results of @xcite , who studied the evolution of star clusters on eccentric orbits in a static axisymmetric potential .",
    "we also studied the distribution of the jacobi energy @xmath78 of the cluster stars and found that it depends strongly on the location of the cluster along the orbit .",
    "it remains , nevertheless , roughly symmetrical with respect to the jacobi energy of the cluster orbit .",
    "two peaks develop , one on each side of this energy , and their relative amplitude depends on the location of the cluster along the orbit . at apocentres",
    "the distribution is tri - modal and the three peaks are very clearly separated . at pericentres ,",
    "the distribution is much more extended and the central peak is not clearly delineated .",
    "we find that the mass loss of the cluster is mainly determined by the orbit - averaged tidal forcing .",
    "in other words , the shape of the gravitational potential  at least in the case studied here  affects the dissolution time - scale only very little . on the other hand ,",
    "the stellar bar has a strong effect on the shape and morphological evolution of the tidal tails : the stability of the orbit has a strong impact on how long the tidal tails and their sub - structures actually survive .",
    "this makes it more subtle to reconstruct the cluster orbits in observations and thus to probe that galactic potential in the disc plane .",
    "this could also be the case small galactic altitudes in which the 3-d shape of orbits is strongly affected by the stellar bar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
