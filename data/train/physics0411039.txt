    "the phenomenon of heart rate variability ( hrv ) in humans desrcibes the beat - to - beat , apparently random , fluctuation of the heart rate@xmath0 .",
    "hrv measured by the time span between ventricular contractions , known as the beat - to - beat rr interval ( rri ) , is also known to share many characteristics found in other natural phenomena .",
    "for example , daytime rri in healthy humans exhibits 1/f - like power spectrum@xmath1 , multifractal scaling@xmath2 , and similar increment distribution observed in fluid turbulence@xmath3 .",
    "these characteristics may vary significantly in heart disease patients depending on the severity of the disease@xmath4 .    the origin and the generation of hrv remain the biggest challenges in the contemporary hrv research .",
    "although the respiratory and vascular systems constantly modulate the heart rate , they do not explain the large percentage of the broad - band ( multifractal ) signal power in hrv .",
    "for example , it is unlikely that this broad - band feature results directly from the output of the narrow - band respiratory dynamics@xmath5 .",
    "also , it is known that the level and the variability of blood pressure and heart rate can change significantly from upright to supine positions . in a 42-day long bed rest test , fortrat et al .",
    "showed that the variation in blood pressure and heart before and after the test are qualitatively different , suggesting separate control mechanisms for generating their variability@xmath6 .",
    "it is thus believed that a more sophisticated structure may exist , which integrates the feedback from receptors to create the pattern of hrv@xmath7 .",
    "apart from its origin , some progess on the hrv generating mechanism may be possible by using the discrete ( lattice ) multiplicative cascade model@xmath3 .",
    "this is purely a phenomenology approach that does not prescribe to any physiology term .",
    "nontheless , encouraging results were obtained that are consistent with the physiological data in health and in certain heart disease@xmath3 .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to investigate the basis of this modeling strategy .",
    "our approach is based on the scale invariant symmetry implied from the hrv phenomenology@xmath8 . since rri can not be defined between heart beats , it is appropriate to consider discrete scale invariance ( dsi ) in hrv",
    ". it is known that discrete cascade implies dsi@xmath9 .",
    "better characterization of dsi in hrv is thus important since it is the necessary condition for the multifractal scaling observed in hrv .",
    "the existence of cascade is also significant because it represents a very different approach of the cardiovascular dynamical system from feedback control that is additive in principle .",
    "the idea will support the previous studies that a direct influence from baroreflex to multifractal hrv is unlikely@xmath6 , as well as the need to search for a role by the higher control centers in hrv@xmath7 .",
    "the consequence of dsi is an oscillating scaling law with a well - defined power law period .",
    "such a scaling law is said to exhibit log - periodicity ( lp ) . in this work",
    ", we analyzed dsi in daytime healthy hrv by searching lp in the scaling of hrv .",
    "typically , lp is  averaged out \" in the process of finding the scaling law . using the technique called  rephasing ,",
    "\" this problem can be effectively resolved and evidence of multiple dsi groups in the healthy daytime rri data was found . in light of this new result , a cascade model is constructed using random branching law to reproduce not only some ofthe known hrv phenomenology , but also the multiple dsi characteristics .",
    "the results of this work are organized in five sections . in section 2",
    ", a brief review of the notion of dsi is given .",
    "the numerical procedures for identifying the dsi property from time series are described in section 3 .",
    "numerical examples and results on daytime heart rate data sets are given in section 4 .",
    "concluding remarks are given in the last section .",
    "a random processes @xmath10 is said to possess continuous scale invariant symmetry@xmath11 if its distribution is preserved after the change of variables , @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are real numbers ; i.e. , @xmath16 dsi is defined when ( 1 ) only holds for a countable set of scale factors @xmath17 .",
    "scale invariance implies power law .",
    "the power law in dsi has a log - periodic correction of frequency @xmath18 : i.e. , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "generally@xmath22 , one can consider @xmath23 , @xmath24 being @xmath25-dependent , and @xmath26 is a complex number for @xmath27 .",
    "novikov suggested lp in the small scale energy cascade of the turbulent flow@xmath28 .",
    "sornette and co - workers showed that lp exists more generally in physical and financial systems , such as turbulence@xmath22 , earthquake@xmath29 , rupture@xmath30 and stock market crashes@xmath31 .",
    "the existence of the discrete scale factor implies a hierarchical structure .",
    "this link can be simply illustrated by the middle third cantor set with the scale factor @xmath32 . with proper rescaling , a precise copy of the set",
    "is only obtained with a 3-fold manification of the scale@xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath10 denotes the lebesgue measure at scale @xmath25 , the cantor set can be modeled by ( 1 ) using @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the power law exponent of @xmath10 ( the box dimension of the cantor set@xmath34 ) assumes a log - periodic oscillation of frequency @xmath35 about its mean value @xmath36 .",
    "the hierarchical structure can be a dynamic object as a result of some time - dependent branching law .",
    "such a dynamic hierarchy is believed to exist , for example , in the cascade paradigm of the energy exchange in fluid turbulence where the break - down or  branching \" of large - scale vortices into ones of smaller scales can occur randomly in space - time with the energy re - distribution following a multiplication scheme . in data analysis",
    ", the dynamic hierarchy poses a technical difficulty for finding the scale factor @xmath14 since lp may be averaged out in the process of obtaining the power law .",
    "zhou and sornette proposed to conduct averaging _",
    "after _ rephasing or re - aligning data segments using a central maximum criterion@xmath22 . using this technique ,",
    "these authors successfully extracted lp in turbulence and proposed the dsi symmetry and cascade .",
    "the rephasing technique is adopted in this work . instead of the central maximum criterion , the cross - correlation property of the data segments will be used ( see step ( d ) below ) .",
    "let @xmath37 denote the rri between the @xmath38 and @xmath39 heart beats .",
    "based on the turbulence analogy of hrv@xmath3 , we focus on the lp in the scaling exponent of the empirical law @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is a real number .",
    "the implementation of the rephasing follows a 8-step algorithm ; see fig .  1",
    ".    \\(a ) divide @xmath37 into @xmath43 nonoverlapping segments @xmath44 .",
    "\\(b ) for @xmath45 , calculate @xmath46 savitzky - golay ( sg ) filter@xmath7 to @xmath47 and calculate its first derivative to obtain a @xmath48-dependent @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath51 sg filter performs a @xmath52 order polynomial fit over @xmath53 samples@xmath22 .",
    "it can produce a smoothing effect in the high frequency while preserving the statistical moments of the signal up to the order of the filter .",
    "\\(d ) randomly select the @xmath54th segment as the base segment and compute the cross - correlation @xmath55 between @xmath49 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "\\(e ) shift the time origin of @xmath58 by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 , so that the cross - correlation between @xmath61 and the shifted @xmath62 has a maximum at zero time lag .",
    "note that @xmath63 for the base segment .",
    "\\(f ) average the shifted @xmath64 , to obtain @xmath65 .",
    "\\(g ) compute the spectrum of @xmath65 .",
    "\\(h ) return to ( c ) with different @xmath66 values .",
    "a lomb periodogram@xmath67 @xmath68 is used to estimate the spectrum of @xmath65 for its superiority in handling situations where noise plays a fundamental role in the signal , as well as its capability in handling small data set .",
    "although the above algorithm provides the systematic steps to estimate the log - periodic component , noise in the empirical data can also generate spurious peaks in the lomb periodogram . for independent gaussian noise process , this problem can be analyzed by the false alarm probability@xmath69 : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is proportional to the number of points in the spectrum .",
    "the smaller the value @xmath72 is , the more likely a genuine log - periodic component exists in the signal .",
    "thus , a lomb peak with large @xmath72 suggests a chance event .",
    "zhou and sornette conducted extensive simulations and showed that ( 2 ) is in fact an upper bound for a number of correlated noise except for those showing long - term _ persistent _ correlation@xmath73 . the fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) of a hurst exponent greater than 0.5 is an example where ( 2 ) does not apply .",
    "the multiple scaling exponents in healthy daytime hrv have been found to lie below such a threshold@xmath74 and we will continue to use ( 2 ) in this work .",
    "as shown above , dsi is characterized by the frequency @xmath18 of the lp .",
    "however , significant lomb peaks may only capture the higher harmonics @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "it is therefore necessary to define the relation of the significant peaks .",
    "we propose a simple procedure to achieve this .",
    "first , we collect the significant peaks satisfying @xmath77 for @xmath78 and for different sg filter parameters .",
    "second , we form a significant lomb peak histogram ( slph ) and locate its local maxima .",
    "these maxima identifies the most probable frequencies of the log - periodic oscillation of the power law .",
    "let such maxima be @xmath79 .",
    "the last step of the procedure is to search the smallest @xmath14 to minimize @xmath80 for integers @xmath81 s .",
    "we seek the smallest @xmath14 since , with finite precision in numerical computing , @xmath82 can be made arbitrarily small as @xmath83 this minimization step is simple , easy to implement and , as we show below using synthetic data , it is also effective .",
    "the rephasing algorithm introduced above was first tested on synthetic data generated by the discrete cascade@xmath3 @xmath84 where the cascade components @xmath85 are discrete - time processes given by @xmath86 for @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is a zero - mean gaussian random variable of variance 1 .",
    "let @xmath91 . the scale factor @xmath14 in the dsi hierarchy is related to @xmath92 s by @xmath93 to model the bounded rri",
    ", we further assume @xmath94 to assure boundedness .",
    "this model has been used in the past to simulate hrv phenomenology , including transition of rri increment probability density function and multifractal scaling@xmath3 .    according to ( 4 ) , we generated 30 sets of dyadic ( @xmath95 ) and triadic ( @xmath32 ) @xmath96 with the corresponding @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "each @xmath96 has 8192 points and is divided into segments of 1024 points .",
    "twenty - four sets of @xmath51 sg filter are defined based on @xmath99 , @xmath100 . for each combination of @xmath66 , steps ( c ) to ( h ) in the rephasing algorithm",
    "is repeated six times based on six different base segments selected in step ( d ) of the algorithm .",
    "this is implemented to avoid bias from a particular segment .",

    "numerical results for @xmath106 show more variability due to poor statistics .",
    "2a shows the @xmath49 of a particular segment of one of the dyadic @xmath96 s . the log - periodic oscillation with a log - period @xmath107 is clearly seen .",
    "the lomb periodogram of @xmath108 ( step ( f ) above ) is shown in fig .",
    "2b based on a particular choice of @xmath66 and the dominant lp is seen to pick up the second harmonics of @xmath109 .",
    "the slph estimated for different sg filters over 30 sets of @xmath96 is obtained in fig .",
    "the clustering of the local maxima at integer multiples of @xmath110 is evident .",
    "the minimization ( 3 ) identifies the correct scale factor @xmath95 for the dyadic cascade .",
    "similar results of the tradic cascade are also found ( fig .",
    "these examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed numerical procedures .      for hrv ,",
    "two databases are considered .",
    "the first set ( db1 ) consists of 10 ambulatory rri recordings from healthy young adults@xmath3 .",
    "these test subjects were allowed to conduct normal daily activities .",
    "the second set ( db2 ) , available from the public domain@xmath111 , consists of 18 ambulatory rri recordings showing normal sinus rhythm .",
    "the parameters used in the numerical analysis are the same as above except the data segment length has increased to 2048 points .",
    "the choice of the segment length is a balance of two factors : small segment length results in more segments but poorer statistics in the estimation of @xmath49 ; large segment length results in less segments but better estimate of @xmath49 .",
    "we tried 1024 points per segment and found similar results ; i.e. , the group averaged @xmath14 value is similar to the ones reported in fig .  5 below .",
    "the slph in all cases shows well positioned local maxima that can be easily related to the harmonics of some fundamental frequency ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the @xmath14 values for db1 and db2 are summarized in fig .",
    "it is observed that ( a ) there are non - integer scale factor @xmath14 and ( b ) the @xmath14 s cluster in the range of [ 3.5 , 5.5 ] and the group averaged @xmath14 are @xmath1124.8 and @xmath1124.4 for db1 and db2 , respectively .",
    "the noninteger @xmath14 unambiguously excludes the possibility of discrete cascades with one scale factor .",
    "it implies more complicated branching law and multiple dsi groups in healthy hrv .    although hrv and turbulence exhibit similar phenomenology@xmath3 , it is interesting to point out the rather large @xmath14 value ( @xmath113 ) compared with the @xmath114 in fluid turbulence@xmath115 . from the discrete cascade viewpoint ,",
    "a larger @xmath14 is compatible with the  patchiness \" appearance commonly observed in the rri of healthy humans@xmath116 since the @xmath85 s of the cascade will fluctuate on a longer time scale to create the effect .    to model the multiple dsi in cascade hrv , the scale factor @xmath14 used in ( 5 )",
    "is set to be a random number so that the log - periodic oscillation of @xmath117 can vary over a range of frequencies .",
    "we generated 30 sets of @xmath96 according to ( 4 ) using uniformly distributed @xmath14 in the interval [ 2,6 ] .",
    "the simulated @xmath96 exhibits the  patchiness \" pattern observed in the rri data ( fig .",
    "6 ) , and similar scaling characteristics found in the past@xmath3 ( figs .",
    "7a @xmath112 7c ) .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath118 of the power law @xmath119 exhibits log - periodic oscillation that is captured by the well positioned local maxima in slph ( figs .  7d , 7e ) .",
    "in addition , the average of the @xmath14 s lies close to the group - averaged @xmath14 values of db1 and db2 ( fig .",
    "it is known that discrete cascade leads to dsi and characterized by log - periodic modulation of the scaling property@xmath120 .",
    "hence , the lp reported in this work supports the view of a cascade for the multifractal generation in hrv .",
    "it implies a more sophisticated process than reflex - based control mechanisms that function on the additive basis .",
    "it also suggests the need to search for a role by the higher control centers in hrv@xmath7 .",
    "it is conjectured that the cascade describes the process which integrates the regulatory feedbacks in the cardiovascular system to create the pattern of hrv .",
    "the non - integer scale factor implies multiple dsi .",
    "this property was also reported in the screening competition of the growth of diffusion limited aggregation model@xmath121 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first instance of multiple dsi being reported in hrv .",
    "we do not have the better knowledge of its origin , except to believe it reflects the multiple time - scale control mechanisms in the cardiovascular dynamical system .",
    "it is tempting to search for the physiological correlate of the cascade , for example , the role of the cascade components @xmath122 . based on the spectral analysis , we suggested that the large time scale components ( @xmath123 ) capture mainly the sympatho - vagal interaction and the small time scale components ( @xmath124 ) capture the parasympathetic activity@xmath3 .",
    "however , we should caution that cascade is a modeling tool derived from statistical physics .",
    "the @xmath85 can therefore represent the range of micro- to macroscopic processes in the cardiovascular dynamical system .",
    "a rather narrow range of the scale factor @xmath125 $ ] estimated from the two different databases implies a  stable \" hierarchical structure of the cascade that does not vary sensitively with the details of the healthy population .",
