    "meanwhile , the data also shrunk the parameter space of signatures of new physics , such as the power spectral features , the primordial non - gaussianities , the residual isocurvature modes , the power asymmetry and the running of spectral index , therefore placing stringent constraints on more complicated inflationary models .    among typical single - field models of slow - roll inflation ,",

    "both of them are able to generate a perturbation spectrum which may lead to the microwave background anisotropy and the structure formation in the universe .",
    "interestingly , in the absence of matter , the starobinsky model is conformally equivalent to the einstein gravity plus a scalar field @xcite . in the same case ,",
