    ", the most advanced approach in developing correspondences between spectral statistic and non  linear dynamics is semiclassical analysis . beginning with berry s seminal work  @xcite it became understood that information on spectral correlations is stored in action correlations of classical periodic orbits ( see also  @xcite . )",
    "going beyond the ` diagonal ' approximation  @xcite wherein only identical ( and mutually time  reversed ) orbits contributing to the gutzwiller double sum  @xcite are taken into account , a hierarchy of ever more complex expansions in orbit pairs has been constructed  @xcite . in this way",

    "some time ago , a field theoretical approach to quantum chaos  dubbed the ballistic @xmath0model  has been introduced @xcite as an alternative to semiclassical expansions .",
    "the most promising aspect of this development is that in field theory the full information on universal rmt correlations is obtained in a very simple manner , viz . by integration over globally uniform ` mean field ' configurations ; universality of chaotic quantum systems is proven , once it has been shown that at sufficiently low energies ( long times ) fluctuations become negligible and the field theory indeed reduces to its mean field sector . unfortunately , however , it has so far not been possible to demonstrate this reduction in a truly convincing manner .",

    ", we have developed an alternative approach  @xcite which is based on field theoretical methods and avoids diagrammatic resummations altogether .",
    "rather , it is based on two alternative pieces of input , both of which have been discussed separately before :    * the exact equivalence of a spectral average for a quantum graph with incommensurate bond lengths to an average over a certain ensemble of unitary matrices @xcite . * an exact mapping of the phase  averaged spectral correlation functions onto a variant of the supersymmetric @xmath0model by an integral transform known as the color  flavor transformation  @xcite .    the synthesis of _ i. _ and _ ii .",
