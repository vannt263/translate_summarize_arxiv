    "low temperature electron transport in disordered conductors with electron - electron interactions remains one of the most intriguing topics in modern mesoscopic physics .",
    "interplay between charge discreteness , quantum coherence , scattering and interactions yields a rich variety of non - trivial effects , many of which can adequately be described only within a rather complicated theoretical framework .",
    "one of the most successful theoretical approaches in mesoscopic physics is the scattering matrix formalism @xcite . in the absence of interactions",
    "this method allows for a complete and physically transparent analysis of electron dynamics in coherent conductors which includes not only electrical conductance but also shot noise @xcite and eventually all higher cumulants of the current operator @xcite .",
    "formally it is possible to generalize the landauer formalism to systems with interactions @xcite . within this approach , however , the electron green functions in the interacting region still remain to be evaluated diagrammatically or by other means .    an alternative way to tackle the problems with disorder and interactions is to employ non - perturbative path - integral - based techniques @xcite .",
    "recently it was demonstrated @xcite that the advantages of the path integral methods and the scattering matrix approach can be conveniently combined within one formalism , thereby providing a powerful tool to theoretically describe interaction effects in mesoscopic conductors .",
    "several important results have already been obtained in this way .",
    "for instance , with the aid of the instanton technique it was shown @xcite that  similarly to tunnel junctions @xcite  arbitrary coherent conductors can exhibit the phenomenon of weak charge quantization .",
    "unfortunately , in the limit of large dimensionless conductances @xmath0 this effect is rather weak and it gains importance only at exponentially small temperatures and voltages .",
    "furthermore , weak charge quantization vanishes completely even at @xmath1 provided at least one of the conducting channels is fully transparent @xcite .",
    "the results @xcite were later confirmed and extended in refs . and .",
    "another  much more robust  effect of electron - electron interactions is the so - called interaction correction to the @xmath2 curve .",
    "this interaction correction is negative and its magnitude scales linearly with the parameter @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the transmission of the @xmath5-th conducting channel .",
    "in contrast to the effect of weak charge quantization , even for large conductances @xmath6 the interaction correction remains clearly observable up to high temperatures and it vanishes only for @xmath7 , i.e. provided _ all _ the conducting channels in the system are fully transparent .",
    "moreover , as both temperature and voltage get lowered , the interaction correction grows logarithmically @xcite . as a result , at sufficiently low energies",
    "the smallness @xmath8 gets compensated by a large logarithm and the system enters a non - perturbative regime where terms of all orders in the interaction need to be evaluated .",
    "let us also recall that for a particular case of highly conducting tunnel junctions this logarithmic enhancement of the interaction correction is already well known for single- and double - junction systems @xcite as well as for tunnel junction arrays @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to observe that both interaction correction to the conductance and the shot noise spectrum @xcite are proportional to the same parameter @xmath9 ( [ beta ] ) .",
    "this observation illustrates a close relation between quantum noise and interaction effects in coherent conductors @xcite .",
    "proceeding further along these lines one can investigate the effect of electron - electron interactions on current noise @xcite .",
    "the interaction correction to the nyquist noise was again found to scale with the parameter ( [ beta ] ) ( in accordance with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ) while the same correction to the shot noise turned out to be proportional to the third cumulant of the current operator .",
    "it was conjectured @xcite that the same rule should apply for higher cumulants as well , i.e. the interaction correction to the @xmath5-th cumulant should be proportional to the @xmath10-th cumulant for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "a general proof of this conjecture was very recently provided in refs . .",
    "throughout the analysis @xcite it was assumed that in the absence of interactions the conductor is described by an _ energy independent _ ( though otherwise general ) scattering matrix @xcite .",
    "while in a number of important cases the above assumption indeed applies , in various other physical situations it turns out to be insufficient",
    ". therefore it would be highly desirable to develop a generalization of the path integral technique @xcite to conductors described by energy dependent scattering amplitudes .",
    "this generalization is the primary goal of our present paper .    in physical terms",
    "our analysis should now effectively account for internal dynamics of coherent conductors or , in other words , for a finite _ dwell time _ of electrons .",
    "this effect should be combined with that of electron - electron interactions . below we will accomplish this program for an important and widely studied class of conductors  the so - called quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper and our main results are as follows .    in sec .",
    "2 we describe our general real time path integral formalism and derive the effective action of interacting quantum dots , eqs .",
    "( [ sdot]-[h0 ] ) of our paper .",
    "the effect of electron - electron interactions is treated in a standard manner by the hubbard - stratonovich decoupling of the coulomb term in the hamiltonian and reducing the problem to that of an electron interacting with the fluctuating quantum electromagnetic field defined on the keldysh contour . in order to handle the fermionic part of the problem we combine our path integral analysis with the scattering matrix approach . for the model of a quantum dot",
    "adopted here the latter approach allows to _ exactly _ integrate out all the electron paths and express the effective action only in terms of the fluctuating fields which are then treated within an effective quasiclassical approximation suitable for highly conducting quantum dots with @xmath6 .    in sec .",
    "3 we derive a general expression for the current noise in chaotic quantum dots as a function of frequency , voltage and temperature .",
    "although this expression itself does not include interactions , it turns out to be very useful for better understanding of the relation between shot noise and interaction effects in mesoscopic conductors .",

    "a more general case of an arbitrary external impedance is considered in sec .",
    "it is demonstrated that , as one goes away from the voltage - biased limit , the interaction correction to the current gets substantially modified and new regimes become possible .",
    "further discussion of our results and their comparison to several recent experiments can be found in sec .",

    "note , that in some other experiments , e.g. , ones with multiwalled carbon nanotubes @xcite , the voltage - biased model appears to be applicable . both the logarithmic temperature dependence @xcite of @xmath226 at larger @xmath315 and its saturation at temperatures of order few kelvin were clearly observed .",
    "the latter temperature range is consistent with the estimates of the parameter @xmath316 for the nanotubes @xcite .",
    "more recently , the logarithmic temperature dependence of the conductance was observed in strongly disordered multiwalled carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "no saturation of this dependence was found down to the lowest measurement temperature @xmath419 mk .",
    "although estimates of the parameter @xmath316 for the samples @xcite yield values below 100 mk , it is not easy to interpret these observations in terms of the high temperature logarithmic regime ( [ chilog ] ) because @xmath420 ( @xmath421 is the diffusion coefficient ) remains shorter than the length of the nanotube @xmath422 at all relevant temperatures @xmath423 k. in this situation our zero - dimensional description can not be applied to the nanotube as a whole .    an alternative explanation is based on viewing the nanotube as a chain of @xmath424 connected in series statistically independent segments of the length @xmath425 . for @xmath426",
    "each of the @xmath424 segments should behave as a zero - dimensional coherent scatterer shunted by an external impedance effectively produced by the remaining @xmath427 segments .",
    "this scenario applies provided the scale @xmath428 exceeds an effective transversal dimension of the system @xmath429 . in the opposite case @xmath430 a slightly more general picture of an array of @xmath431 independent scatterers can be introduced , where the number @xmath432 depends on the ratio @xmath433 . applying the result ( [ lreg ] ) for each of the segments and assuming @xmath434 , at temperatures @xmath407",

    "the crucial point of this scenario is that at sufficiently low @xmath315 the scale @xmath428 does not depend on temperature and is set by interactions .",
    "note that a similar effect was also observed in disordered metallic wires @xcite .",
    "clear deviations from the standard 1d behavior of the interaction correction @xmath443 were reported at temperatures @xmath444 , where @xmath445 is the low temperature dephasing time measured in the same experiment .",
    "for the parameters @xcite one can verify that both the observed magnitude and temperature dependence of the interaction correction are consistent with eq .",
    "( [ ylog ] ) , where @xmath446 and @xmath438 .",
    "turning again to the data @xcite let us recall that in this case the observed values of @xmath447 were considerably smaller than the nanotube circumference @xmath448 .",
    "therefore we can assume @xmath449 and define @xcite @xmath450 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath451 i.e. @xmath428 drops out and for @xmath452 the prefactor in front of the logarithmic term in eq .",

    "this universal value fits well with the observations @xcite at @xmath454 k. finally , we note that the latter inequality is also consistent with the condition @xmath455 because the measured values of @xmath445 were found to be in the range @xmath456 sek .",
    "hence , the assumption @xmath457 and @xmath458 appears to be supported by the data @xcite as well .",

    "however the operator @xmath481 becomes unitary in the limit @xmath482 .",
    "let us now introduce the fluctuating potential @xmath483 and , as we have already discussed in sec . 3 ,",
    "assume that this potential is spatially constant both inside the metallic leads and inside the dot , and it suffers jumps at the junctions between the dot and the leads . in other words ,",
    "we consider three different fluctuating in time potentials @xmath484 , where the index @xmath485 labels the left lead , the dot and the right lead .",
    "the wave functions are then modified in two ways .",
    "first , they acquire additional phase factors @xmath486 these phase factors can be eliminated by a gauge transformation , and we will omit them in what follows .",
    "in addition to that , the phase of the wave function changes every time the electron crosses one of the junctions .",
    "the corresponding additional phase factors acquired by the electron are : @xmath487 below we will restrict ourselves to the case @xmath488 this is sufficient , since the evolution operator at negative times is just a conjugate operator .",
    "taking the phase factors ( [ phasefactors ] ) into account we find @xmath476 in the presence of fluctuating voltages @xmath489 @xmath490 where the matrix @xmath491 reads @xmath492 the relation ( [ uphi ] ) turns out to be remarkably simple since every classical path  though being scattered arbitrarily many times inside the dot and from the outer barriers  can cross these barriers only twice : when it enters and leaves the dot .",
    "the times of these two events are related in a trivial way to the total time of the evolution and to the initial and final coordinates : for any @xmath493 and @xmath494 the path enters the dot at a time @xmath495 and leaves it at a time @xmath496 we also note that this property holds only for structures with two barriers . in systems with three and more barriers no such a simple relation between @xmath497 and @xmath481 exist .",
    "let us now use the above expressions for the evolution operator and derive the effective action of a quantum dot .",
    "we start from the term @xmath83 which is defined by the second term in eq .",

    "( [ gij],[phi ] ) let us transform eq .",
    "( [ sr1 ] ) to the following form @xmath499 let us split this expression by distinguishing each of the three coordinates @xmath15 , @xmath500 and @xmath501 to be in the left lead , in the dot or in the right lead .",
    "altogether we obtain @xmath502 terms . without loss of generality",
    "this number can be reduced substantially by means of the following steps .",
    "first , we choose the initial density matrix @xmath503 in the form corresponding to zero transmissions of both junctions .",
    "for such a choice initially we have three isolated systems , in which case the coordinates @xmath500 and @xmath501 always belong to the same electrode .",
    "this step already reduces the total number of terms down to nine .",
    "second , we restrict ourselves to the limit of sufficiently long times , which is of a primary interest in our problem . in this limit the initial form of the density matrix inside the dot does not matter at all , electron transfer and relaxation processes will eventually lead to some final density matrix in the dot which will be _ independent _ of the initial one .",
    "hence , in the interesting limit of long times our effective action should not depend on the initial density matrix inside the dot and we can safely exclude the dot region from the integration over @xmath500 and @xmath504 extending this integration only at the two reservoirs .",
    "after that we are left with only six terms @xcite , and the action @xmath83 takes the form @xmath505    in order to proceed further , we will make use of the unitarity of the evolution operator .",
    "it yields @xmath506 with the aid of this identity one can express the integrals over @xmath15 in the dot region through the integrals over the coordinate in the leads , where an explicit form of the evolution operator ( [ uphi ] ) is already available .",

    "since we assume that the density matrix in the leads corresponds to the equilibrium fermi distribution of electrons , both this density matrix and the matrix of the phases @xmath115 are diagonal in the channel space @xmath510 the action @xmath83 acquires the following form : @xmath511 .",
