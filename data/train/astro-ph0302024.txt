    "contains a wealth of cosmological information .",
    "one of the crucial factors in determining an accurate power spectrum of these fluctuations is understanding and removing the foreground contamination .",
    "the amplitude of the foreground signal depends on frequency , angular scale and region of sky being observed .",
    "cmb foregrounds comprise point sources and diffuse galactic foregrounds .",
    "point sources are a particular problem at smaller angular scales ( @xmath10 arcmin ) , while diffuse foreground structures become dominant on larger angular scales . here",
    "we concentrate on the problem of diffuse galactic foregrounds at frequencies below @xmath11 ghz , a frequency range which is used in current and upcoming cmb experiments such as the _ map _ and _ planck _ satellites .",
    "the diffuse galactic foreground has 3 ( possibly 4 ) components .",
    "i ) _ synchrotron _ emission from relativistic electrons spiralling in the galactic magnetic field dominates at frequencies below 1 ghz with a spectral index ( @xmath12 ) of @xmath13 ( davies et al . 1996 ) .",
    "it is traced by low - frequency surveys such as those of haslam et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , reich & reich .",
    "( 1988 ) and jonas et al .",
    "( 1998 ) where it is seen to extend well above the plane - e.g. the north polar spur which extends to galactic latitude @xmath14 .",
    "ii ) _ free - free _ bremsstrahlung emission from thermal electrons has a flatter spectral index of @xmath15 .",
    "it is the dominant foreground at frequencies between @xmath16 ghz , where microwave cmb experiments operate ( e.g. dasi , cbi , vsa , _ map _ , _ planck _ ) . the optical h@xmath0line is a good tracer of free - free emission although it requires corrections for dust absorption .",
    "iii ) the _ vibrational _ emission from thermal dust is dominant at frequencies above @xmath17 ghz .",
    "this is thermal emission from warm dust and is well - traced at @xmath18 m where it has its peak .",
    "iv ) an _ anomalous _ component has recently been discovered ( kogut et al .",
    "1996 ; leitch et al .",
    "1997 ; de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "1997,1998,1999,2000,2002 ; finkbeiner et al .",
    "draine & lazarian ( 1998 ) proposed that this could be due to @xmath19 dust grains emitting in a 1 - 2 octave band centred at @xmath20 ghz .",
    "it was first believed to be due to free - free emission ( kogut 1996 ) , but this has been ruled out primarily by the lack of associated h@xmath0emission .",
    "the separation and quantifying of the individual cmb foreground components is a continuing challenge .",
    "each component is of interest in its own right ; its angular distribution and spectrum are basic parameters .",
    "they all contribute as foregrounds to the cmb and their removal is necessary to realize the full potential of current high sensitivity cmb surveys where @xmath21 values are to be measured to an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "such separations are best made using templates for each component . with the advent of the h@xmath0survey ,",
    "such a template is now available for each of the 4 proposed components .",
    "although some approaches to separation of components are being made which reduce the assumptions about the template parameters ( e.g. baccigalupi et al .",
    "2000 ; vielva et al .",
    "2001 ) they still face difficulties where the components are correlated . for example",
    "all the foregrounds are quasi - correlated as they increase strongly towards the galactic plane .",
    "also , the h@xmath0and ( spinning ) dust emissions show considerable correlation over most of the sky ( see section [ discussion ] ) ; this was at the root of the original misunderstanding of the anomalous component",
    ". if one has a good free - free template as we derive here , the other 3 foreground components can be well - characterized except possibly at the lowest galactic latitudes .",
    "extensive filamentary h@xmath0emission regions , of galactic origin , were first found by meaburn ( 1965 , 1967 ) extending to high galactic latitudes ; sivan ( 1974 ) demonstrated the wealth of h@xmath0emission at low - intermediate latitudes but at a relatively low sensitivity of @xmath22 ; we note that 1 rayleigh @xmath23 photons s@xmath24 @xmath25 sr@xmath26 erg s@xmath24 @xmath25 sr@xmath27 for @xmath28 k gas .",
    "several large and very sensitive h@xmath0surveys are now well under way .",
    "the most relevant surveys are listed in table [ halpha_surveys.table ] .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     higher frequency maps will necessarily have higher fractions of free - free emission .",
    "the widely used maps at 1420 mhz ( reich & reich 1988 ) and 2326 mhz ( jonas 1998 ) are used for estimating the galactic contribution at higher frequencies . using the estimate of @xmath29 per cent at 408 mhz ,",
    "the free - free fluctuations at 1420 mhz will contribute @xmath30 per cent compared to the synchrotron component at intermediate latitudes , while at 2326 mhz this increases to @xmath31 per cent . by correcting the 408 mhz map for free - free emission , a better synchrotron map can be made .",
    "this is particularly important for cross - correlation analyses which assume that the templates are not correlated .    with h@xmath0data alone",
    "it is not possible to construct a free - free correction template at lower galactic latitudes .",
    "[ ha_map.fig ] shows regions along the galactic plane where the dust absorption is too large to estimate an accurate dust - free h@xmath0intensity .",
    "we plan to use multi - frequency maps of the galactic plane to separate the free - free and synchrotron components at low latitudes .",
    "the narrow free - free latitude distribution along the plane has a peak brightness at 408 mhz which varies from 40 to 80 per cent that of the broader synchrotron distribution at @xmath32 to @xmath33 ( large , mathewson & haslam 1961 ) .",
    "accordingly , the correction of the 408 mhz map for free - free emission is important at low latitudes .",
    "the other factor in constructing a template at @xmath34 resolution from the low frequency radio maps is the effect of the main - beam to full - beam ratio ( @xmath35 ) on angular scales of a few degrees ; we note that the brightness temperature scale of the published maps is on the full - beam scale ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the result is that temperatures on the main - beam scale ( @xmath37 ) should be multiplied by a factor @xmath35 to bring them to the correct brightness temperature scale .",
    "this procedure has been considered in sections [ scans ] and [ subtract ] and clearly needs to be taken into account for accurate free - free and synchrotron predictions .",
    "this scale - dependence to true brightness temperature has been noted before ( e.g. jonas et al . 1998 ) and is currently under review when applying it to existing full - sky maps .",
    "the h@xmath0intensities given by wham and shassa have quoted calibration accuracies of 10 and 9 per cent respectively .",
    "the corresponding zero level uncertainties are approximately 0.2 and 0.5 @xmath38 .",
    "the accuracy is likely to be improved as these surveys are refined .",
    "the largest uncertainty in the h@xmath0intensity is in the dust absorption correction as discussed in section [ dust_absorption ] . at intermediate and higher galactic latitudes where @xmath39 mag ,",
    "the error in the corrected @xmath40 is @xmath41 per cent ; this error increases to @xmath42 per cent where @xmath43 is 1 mag nearer the galactic plane .",
    "on converting the dust - corrected @xmath44 to @xmath45 , the free - free brightness temperature , a further uncertainty is introduced by the spread in @xmath46 , the electron temperature , in the local region of the galaxy covered by the h@xmath0maps . for @xmath47 k , the @xmath45 uncertainty is @xmath48 per cent as derived from equation ( [ tb_ha.eqn ] ) . as far as the emission theory used in section [ halpha_conversion ]",
    "is concerned , we believe that the gaunt factor and the analytical relations given are accurate to 1 - 2 per cent . it is assumed throughout that the h@xmath0emission is given by the case b emission formulae",
    "; the observed radio @xmath45 values are consistent with this assumption .",
    "( 80,60 ) ( 0,0 )      a radio - independent method of determining a free - free template has a significant benefit in establishing the other galactic foreground templates for cmb studies .",
    "we have already shown in section [ full_synch ] that an improved synchrotron template can be derived from the 408 mhz map by correcting for the known free - free emission .",
    "this method breaks down for the small area along the galactic plane where the dust absorption of the h@xmath0becomes too high ; other methods of determining the free - free emission are available here .    spinning dust radiating in the region 10 - 40 ghz",
    "is proposed as a galactic foreground ( draine & lazarian 1998 ) ; observations appear to confirm this scenario ( kogut et al .",
    "1996 ; leitch et al .",
    "1997 ; de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 , 1999 , 2000 , 2002 ; finkbeiner et al .",
    "a strong confirmation of the presence of spinning dust radio emission correlated with the sfd98 dust template requires a clean separation of the free - free component beforehand .",
    "this is important because the dust and h@xmath0are generally thought of as being correlated .",
    "an example of a region of the galaxy where the correlation is relatively strong is @xmath49 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ tt_plots.fig](a ) which shows the correlation between h@xmath0and ( @xmath50 ) from sfd98 at @xmath34 resolution .",
    "the relation between @xmath44 and @xmath50 for the region in orion @xmath51 to @xmath52 is given in fig .",
    "[ tt_plots.fig ] ( b ) where it is seen that the correlation is less strong .",
    "the distribution of h@xmath0and dust for the orion region is shown in fig .",
    "[ correlations.fig ] .",
    "the situation is clearly complex on the scale of @xmath34 as would be expected for a star - forming region and underscores the necessity of removing the free - free emission before investigating spinning dust .",
    "( 80,80 ) ( 0,0 )      we will now estimate the free - free contribution to the cmb foregrounds at @xmath42 ghz .",
    "if not subtracted from the data , the foreground signal will add in quadrature to the cmb signal in the power spectrum since they will be uncorrelated on the sky .",
    "the free - free template allows statistical estimates to be made of the free - free component on angular scales @xmath53 compared to the primordial cmb fluctuations . at angular scales of @xmath34 ( @xmath54 ) ,",
    "the cmb has r.m.s .",
    "fluctuations of @xmath55k , falling to @xmath56k at smaller and larger angular scales . over a large portion of the higher latitude sky ( @xmath57 ) ,",
    "the average contribution of free - free emission is @xmath58k at 30 ghz on scales of @xmath34 .",
    "this amounts to a @xmath59 per cent increase in the power spectrum at @xmath60 .",
    "however , individual regions may be contaminated at a much higher level depending on their position . at higher frequencies ( @xmath61 ghz ) ,",
    "the free - free contribution will be @xmath62k and will be negligible at high latitudes .",
    "we can also compare the estimates for specific regions of the sky where cmb observations have been made .",
    "the vsa has observed three regions of the sky measuring angular scales of @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) covering a total area of 101 square degrees at a frequency of 34 ghz ( taylor et al .",
    "the contamination from free - free emission using the free - free template is estimated to give an r.m.s .",
    "temperature of @xmath65k at the @xmath34 scale and hence the free - free contamination is negligible in these selected regions .",
    "the north celestial pole ( ncp ) region has been studied by the saskatoon group ( wollack et al .",
    "the saskatoon data show an anomalous component which can not be explained on conventional grounds . using the free - free template , the r.m.s .",
    "variations are @xmath66k in a @xmath67-diameter circle centred on the ncp on smoothing the h@xmath0map to a resolution of @xmath68 and assuming a conversion factor of @xmath69k@xmath70 .",
    "simonetti et al .",
    "( 1996 ) use their h@xmath0data to estimate an upper limit of @xmath71k at 27.5 ghz in this region .",
    "these values of @xmath72k can be compared with the @xmath73k r.m.s .",
    "variations in the saskatoon data .",
    "it therefore seems clear , that the anomalous emission is not in the form of free - free emission from gas at @xmath74 k. the current view is that it may be due to spinning dust emission as proposed by draine & lazarian ( 1998 ) .",
    "the recent publication of h@xmath0surveys covering the majority of the sky has provided a break - through in obtaining a free - free galactic foreground template of importance for cmb and ism studies .",
    "having derived the free - free template it is then possible to determine a better synchrotron template and to make real progress in constructing a spinning dust template .",
    "the free - free template has many other applications which include a re - analysis of the _ cobe - dmr _ data ( banday et al .",
    ", in preparation ) and a free - free power spectrum analysis ( dickinson et al . , in preparation ) .    we can look forward to an improved all - sky free - free template at higher resolution than the @xmath34 used in the present work .",
    "a combination of the high resolution ( arcmin scale ) narrow - band filter surveys such as shassa and vtss combined with the high sensitivity fabry - perot survey at a @xmath34 scale would be ideal . at lower galactic latitudes where the dust absorption of the h@xmath0emission is significant",
    ", multi - frequency continuum surveys should be able to separate the strong synchrotron and free - free components .",
    "recombination line surveys such as those being undertaken with hipass in the south ( barnes et al .",
    "2001 ) and hijass in the north ( kilborn 2002 ) will provide a confirmation of the low latitude free - free template and distinguish it from spinning dust which will have a very similar latitude distribution .",
    "the recombination line data will also lead to a kinematic 2-dimensional picture of the ionized gas distribution in the galaxy using kinematic distances since they contain velocity information .",
