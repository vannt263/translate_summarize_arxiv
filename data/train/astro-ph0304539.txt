    "the early works on interstellar turbulence , summarized by @xcite , pointed out that the interstellar medium ( ism ) exhibits reynolds numbers so large that it is very likely to be turbulent . for",
    "incompressible turbulent flows the @xcite theory predicts a dissipation - free energy cascade between large scales where turbulent energy is injected , down to small scales where it is dissipated and heats the gas . in this inertial range",
    "the theory predicts a three - dimensional power law energy spectrum ( @xmath4 ) , which has been observed extensively in terrestrial turbulence experiments ( see @xcite for an example ) .    since the work of @xcite",
    ", several studies have shown that the interstellar medium density and velocity structures projected onto the plane of the sky are self - similar and well described by power laws .",
    "for instance , a number of works were done on h@xmath5 centroid velocity fields in hii regions using auto - correlation and structure functions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the self - similar structure of hi has also been studied , almost exclusively using the power spectrum of the 21 cm emission in galactic @xcite and extra - galactic regions @xcite .",
    "various studies aimed at describing the fractal properties of dust infrared emission were also done using power spectra @xcite and the area - perimeter relation @xcite .",
    "but it is probably on molecular clouds ( co emission ) that most of the work has been done using several statistical tools : the size - linewidth relation @xcite , the auto - correlation function @xcite , wavelet decomposition @xcite , the area - perimeter relation @xcite , principal component analysis @xcite and the @xmath6-variance method @xcite .",
    "all those studies suggest that turbulence , for which such self - similar properties are expected , may play a key role in the structuration of the interstellar medium , both in density and velocity .",
    "furthermore , by providing non - thermal support against self - gravitational collapse , turbulence also regulates star formation @xcite .",
    "it might also have a strong and very non - linear impact on dust evolution by accelerating the coagulation or fragmentation of grains @xcite , and on the ism chemical evolution as intermittent energy dissipation could locally trigger endothermic reactions @xcite . however , following @xcite , interstellar turbulence may be very different from kolmogorov s prediction .",
    "the interstellar medium is compressible and magnetized , and several processes inject energy at very different scales ( from galactic differential rotation down to stellar winds ) .",
    "therefore , the description of interstellar turbulence in various environments is mandatory to understand its role on the structure , kinematics , energy transfer , thermodynamics and chemistry of the gas at various scales .",
    "one important issue here is to relate the statistical properties of the observed quantities ( integrated emission , channel maps and centroid velocity ) to the three - dimensional properties of the density and velocity fields , which actually describe interstellar turbulence .",
    "this calls for reliable methods to extract the relevant information from spectro - imagery observations , called position - position - velocity ( ppv ) data cubes , and disentangle the density , velocity , and temperature contributions to the observed space - velocity structures .",
    "there is also a need to understand the effects of 3d-2d projection and of line opacity on the observed statistical properties .",
    "lately there has been a number of works based on ppv data cubes to deduce the statistical properties of the underlying three - dimensional density and velocity fields of hi observations @xcite .",
    "most of these works are based on the theoretical work of @xcite ( hereafter lp00 ) , who proposed a method to deduce the 3d density and velocity power spectral indexes , respectively noted @xmath1 and @xmath3 thereafter , from the ppv cubes .    in this paper",
    ", we study the spectral properties of simulated ppv cubes using fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) density and velocity fields , with the twofold purpose of comparing them with the predictions of lp00 , and proposing another method , based on the centroid velocity map , to determine the spectral index of the three - dimensional velocity field .",
    "the reason for using fbms , despite their lack of physical reality , lies with their well - behaved statistical properties and the ease with which they can be generated . with single - index power law power spectra and gaussian fluctuations ,",
    "fractional brownian motions represent useful and flexible test cases for structure statistics retrieval methods .",
    "such random fields were used for instance by @xcite to describe molecular cloud images using @xmath6-variance analysis , and by @xcite to retrieve the statistics of turbulent interstellar velocity fields through the use of principal component analysis ( pca ) .",
    "it should however be stressed that these fields do not arise from physical simulations . in particular , they do not comply with hydrodynamics nor gravity , and are used solely for their statistical simplicity .",
    "this kind of study based on fbms usefully complements those conducted on magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations ( see for instance @xcite ) because the lack of physics is somewhat compensated by the broad range of scales accessible to the analysis in terms of power laws . in numerical simulations of turbulence",
    "the inertial range is severely limited by the available resolution and the large number of scales affected by injection and dissipation .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec_fbm ] , we briefly present fbms and their properties , in the context of designing simple model distributions for our three - dimensional density and velocity fields .",
    "the computation of ppv data cubes from these fields is detailed in section  [ sec_simul_ppv ] , then an analysis of their spectral properties is done in section  [ sec_stat_prop ] .",
    "section  [ sec_conclu ] presents our concluding remarks .",
    "an appendix contains some details on analytical computations .",
    "a fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) is a gaussian random field @xmath7 which can be defined , as done in @xcite , in any euclidean dimension @xmath8 by the relation @xmath9 ^ 2 > ~\\propto~||{\\bf r_2}-{\\bf r_1}||^{2h}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , called the hurst exponent , is a real number in @xmath11 $ ] , and the brackets stand for a spatial average over positions @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the value @xmath14 gives the usual brownian motion , for which it is well known that the mean squared increment @xmath15",
    "^ 2>$ ] scales as the separation @xmath16 .",
    "this relation states that the fluctuations of the field are isotropic , and that their amplitude as a function of scale is a power law .",
    "it easily translates into a similar relation for the power spectrum , which is the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function @xmath17 : @xmath18 where isotropy is expressed by the fact that @xmath19 depends only on the wavenumber @xmath20 , which is the length of the @xmath8-dimensional wave vector @xmath21 . the power spectral index @xmath22 is related to the hurst exponent and the dimension by @xmath23 .",
    "several methods are available to numerically generate fbms ( for instance as a collection of clumps with a power law mass spectrum , see @xcite ) , but the easiest is based on eq .  [ eq_fourier_fbm ] and the fact that @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath24 , the squared amplitude of the fourier transform of @xmath7 .",
    "hence we first compute an isotropic amplitude following a power law : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a normalization factor .",
    "then the phase @xmath27 is constructed using a random number generator algorithm based on a uniform distribution between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and to make sure the image in direct space is real , we enforce the constraint @xmath30 . from the amplitude and the phase ,",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the fourier transform are computed : @xmath31=a({\\bf k})\\cos[\\phi({\\bf k})]\\ ] ] @xmath32=a({\\bf k})\\sin[\\phi({\\bf k})]\\ ] ] and the fbm @xmath33 is simply obtained by taking the inverse fourier transform of @xmath34 .",
    "the method described here is general for any dimension , and the power spectra of the fields generated this way obey exact power laws , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_example_fbm ] , which shows a two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath35 fbm image , along with its power spectrum . in this figure",
    "we used a scatter plot ( all points of the 2d amplitude are shown ) in order to assess the field s isotropy .",
    "but in other figures of the paper , where we compare power spectra , azimuthal averages are used to make the plots easier to read .",
    "it should also be noted that this fourier - based method of generating fbms leads to periodic distributions and therefore our computations , unlike real observations , will not suffer from non - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the effects of projection from a three - dimensional dynamical medium onto a spectro - imagery observation . to conduct such a study ,",
    "the first step is to generate model interstellar 3d density and velocity fields and from these compute simulated ppv data cubes .",
    "we therefore generated three - dimensional fbms with spectral indexes of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "for each spectral index , two fbms were computed , one for the density field @xmath40 and one for the velocity field @xmath41 .",
    "the computations were also performed with a uniform density field , for which the power spectral index is formally equal to @xmath42 .",
    "here we just consider the line - of - sight ( longitudinal ) velocity component , as it is the only one available to observers .",
    "like @xcite we make the assumption that the 3d velocity field @xmath43 is isotropic and homogeneous and that the longitudinal and lateral velocity components have the same power spectra as @xmath43 .    for the sake of realism , some sort of correlation should exist between the 3d density and velocity fields .",
    "however , for simplicity , the main part of this paper deals with uncorrelated cubes , the effects of a certain amount of correlations between @xmath44 and @xmath45 being reported on in section  [ section_correl ] .    a typical line of sight extracted from one set of 3d density and velocity fields is shown in fig .  [ fig_los ] . the density and velocity fields used in this example have power spectral indexes of @xmath46 - 3.0 and @xmath47 - 4.5 respectively .",
    "the former displays more small - scale structures , as expected for a shallower spectral index @xmath48this criterion holds when comparing fields of the same euclidean dimension , but the relevant number in direct space when assessing the amount of small - scale structures is the hurst exponent , as will be discussed later . here",
    "@xmath49 is equivalent to @xmath50 . ] . by construction , the mean values of the original cubes",
    "are set by the normalization @xmath26 and their variances are determined by the total number of pixels . to obtain physically plausible numbers ,",
    "the following procedure was applied : the minimum values of the density cubes were subtracted from them in order to obtain only positive values , and a multiplicative factor was applied to obtain an average density of @xmath51 . for the velocity cubes",
    ", we first subtracted the mean , then scaled the values to obtain a velocity dispersion of 3  km  s@xmath52 . an important feature",
    "to point out is that , since typically only @xmath53 of the points in a gaussian distribution are more than @xmath54 away from the mean , our density fields present quite low contrasts , with @xmath55 .",
    "this is an unavoidable limitation of these model fields .",
    "to obtain a ppv data cube from the simulated 3d density and velocity fields , we compute , at each position @xmath56 , the spectrum that would be observed in this direction .",
    "this is done under the simplifying assumption that the medium is observed in an optically thin line , such as , in some instances , the 21 cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen . in this case , the spectrum at a given position @xmath56 is computed by simply adding the contributions of all cells along the line of sight , the emission from a single gas cell being a gaussian line centered at velocity @xmath41 and of velocity - integrated area proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "is the depth , in cm , of a cell in the 3d density cube .",

    "this broadening includes not only the thermal velocity dispersion @xmath68 , but also a small - scale velocity gradient which roughly models the subpixel structure of the velocity field @xcite . also , to make sure that we lose a negligible fraction of the signal , the velocity limits in the final ppv cube are given by @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the minimum and maximum values in the 3d velocity field . the number of channels is then obtained by dividing this velocity range by the channel width @xmath62 , which was set to @xmath73 . as a result ,",
    "all of our ppv cubes do not have the same extent in the third dimension , since it depends on the 3d velocity cube and on the temperature .",
    "examples of the line synthesis procedure described above are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_example_spectra ] for the same line of sight that was used in fig .",
    "[ fig_los ] .",
    "these spectra were computed using equations  [ eq_ppv ] for @xmath741  k , 10  k , 100  k , and 500  k. one can see the expected smearing effect of the temperature , which smooths the spectra as @xmath66 increases , similar to the effect of decreasing the spectral resolution . as the temperature increases ,",
    "the spectrum becomes smoother and closer to gaussianity , indicating that the thermal broadening is close to the original dispersion in the input 3d velocity cube . for reference ,",
    "the thermal dispersions for all temperatures are @xmath75 at @xmath741  k , @xmath76 at @xmath7410  k , @xmath77 at @xmath74100  k and @xmath78 at @xmath74 500  k.    the spectrum computed at @xmath74 100  k , a value representative of hi gas , is reminiscent of what is observed at 21 cm in high latitude clouds . at artificially low temperature ( @xmath74 1  k ) many components appear . these components do not correspond to any physical `` cloud '' structure , as they simply represent the fractal properties of velocity and density fluctuations along the line of sight . at such a low kinetic temperature , the line is far from the optically thin regime and the effect of opacity on the observed spectrum would be important .",
    "these spectra are shown only to illustrate the effect of kinetic temperature on our ability to resolve kinematical structures .",
    "the effective spectral resolution of such ppv observations therefore includes the thermal broadening .",
    "considering , as a simplification , a gaussian - shaped channel of full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath62 , this effective resolution is approximately @xmath79      selected channel maps from the ppv cube computed with @xmath80 and @xmath81 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_example_cm ] .",
    "these channel maps are reminiscent of what is observed at 21 cm for instance @xcite .",
    "the structures in neighbouring channel maps are clearly correlated , with both elongated and diffuse structures .",
    "if it is partly due to the channel width being subthermal , correlation still exists between more widely separated channels .",
    "in this section the power spectra of individual channel , integrated emission and centroid velocity maps , obtained from the ppv data cubes , are examined and linked to the statistical properties of the 3d density and velocity fields .",
    "to conduct our analysis , ppv cubes with all possible combinations of 3d density and velocity fields were simulated .",
    "[ fig_channels_v4 ] and [ fig_channels_n4 ] display the integrated emission map , the centroid velocity map , 3 selected channel maps - one in the line center and two in the line wings - and their associated power spectra , for a subset of data cubes .",
    "more precisely , fig .",
    "[ fig_channels_v4 ] shows the variations of these quantities for @xmath82 and all values of @xmath1 , while fig .",
    "[ fig_channels_n4 ] presents the same analysis for @xmath83 and all values of @xmath3 .",
    "a detailed analysis of these figures follows .",
    "it has been shown by several authors ( see for instance @xcite and @xcite ) that , for optically thin gas with gaussian statistics , the power spectral index of the integrated emission map is exactly the power spectrum of the 3d density field , under the condition @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the largest scale on the @xmath56 plane and @xmath86 is the depth in the @xmath87 dimension .",
    "a brief summary of the derivation of this result is given in the appendix .",
    "this is true whether the power spectrum is a power law or not , provided isotropy is maintained . this property of optically thin media is powerful as it allows to directly deduce the power spectrum of the interstellar 3d density field from the observed map .",
    "our simulations confirm this property for the ppv cube integrated emission ( see the top panels of fig .  [ fig_channels_v4 ] and [ fig_channels_n4 ] ) and for the image of the 3d density field integrated along the @xmath87 axis ( see fig .  [ fig_coldens_vs_slice ] ) . the fact that the 3d density field and the integrated emission - which is its projection onto the plane of the sky - should have the same spectral index does not mean , however , that they exhibit the same amount of structure as a function of scale . as already suggested in footnote  [ footnoteh ] , the relevant number in this comparison is the hurst exponent . now , since @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the preservation of the spectral index means that @xmath90 , an effect called projection smoothing .    on the other hand a cut through the 3d density field",
    "would statistically represent the original field , and the hurst exponent would remain the same @xmath91 .",
    "the power spectrum of such a cut would then have an index @xmath92 .",
    "an example of this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_coldens_vs_slice ] for a 1-pixel slice of the 3d density cube .. this can be understood by the fact that our slice through the 3d density cube is not a `` perfect '' one , but indeed has a certain width .",
    "the dispersion effect is more pronounced at small scales , which are comparable to this width . ]",
    "it is also interesting to study the power spectrum of a slice in the intermediate regime , where @xmath93 . to study this ,",
    "the power spectra of density field slices of increasing thickness @xmath86 were computed .",
    "[ fig_ps_vs_d ] presents the power spectra of three cases for @xmath86=5 , 10 and 20 pixels .",
    "the 3d density field used here has @xmath94 .",
    "the power spectra are bent , with a spectral index of @xmath1 at small scales and @xmath95 at large scales .",
    "the transition occurs at a frequency @xmath96 and provides a method to determine the depth of the observed medium .",
    "this is in accordance with the pioneer work of @xcite ( summarized by @xcite ) who studied the effect of projection smoothing on the index of the structure function .",
    "recently , @xcite used this property to determine the thickness of the hi layer in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the absence of such a curvature in the power spectra of large scale hi galactic emission suggests in turn that the depth of the hi layer sampled by the observations is significantly larger than the map size , i.e. much larger than 25 pc in the case of the high latitude cloud observed by @xcite .",
    "this result is also relevant for studies of optically thick media ( e.g. molecular clouds ) where the observed emission comes only from the surface of the cloud . in that case",
    ", the spectral index measured on the integrated emission map of an optically thick tracer should be closer to @xmath95 .",
    "another quantity built from ppv data cubes is the centroid velocity map , which , for any line of sight , is simply an average velocity weighted by the line temperatures , @xmath97    this equation is easily shown to be equivalent to the density - averaged velocity component parallel to the line of sight @xcite : @xmath98    centroid velocity maps have traditionally been used to study gas kinematics in various ism environments .",
    "for instance in the study of the turbulent energy cascade in hii regions @xcite and in molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "but one of the main difficulties of these analyses is to relate the statistical properties of the centroid velocity map to the 3d velocity field .    to assess this relation in the framework of our fbm simulations , we computed the centroid velocity maps from ppv cubes for every combination of @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "some of them are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_channels_v4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_channels_n4 ] , along with their power spectra , and all measured spectral indexes are given in table  [ tab_centroid_exponent ] .",
    "in the range of density and velocity indexes tested , the spectral index @xmath2 of the centroid velocity map is remarkably equal to @xmath3 , whatever the power spectrum of the density field .",
    "[ fig_channels_v4 ] illustrates this behaviour : the velocity centroid maps computed for the different values of @xmath1 are the same , and their power spectra all merge into the same spectrum .",
    "this result is easy to obtain analytically for a uniform density , as is shown in the appendix ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "but , to our knowledge , this is the first time that it is demonstrated for stochastic density fields .",
    "[ fig_centroide_dispersion ] displays the full scatter plots of power versus wavenumber for several ( @xmath1 , @xmath3 ) combinations .",
    "it appears that the dispersion around the power law decreases with steepening density spectra , and in the limit of a uniform density field , isotropy is recovered .",
    "conversely , for a given @xmath1 , the centroid spectra are more scattered for steeper values of @xmath3 .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that density fluctuations manifest themselves more strongly with smoother velocity fields .",
    "further tests of this result have been performed .",
    "for instance , in accordance with eq .",
    "[ eq_centroide2 ] , it does not depend on the gas kinetic temperature , with @xmath2 being equal to @xmath3 in all cases considered .",
    "more interesting was the test of non - fbm density and velocity fields .",
    "one of these involved a velocity field for which the power spectrum was bent , varying from a @xmath99 behaviour at large scales ( small @xmath20 ) to a @xmath100 behaviour at small scales ( large @xmath20 ) . for this , two fbms with respective indexes -3.0 and -5.0 were built and their fourier amplitudes added with proper weights , in which case the curvature of the power spectrum would be imossible to see . ] .",
    "after introduction of a random phase map , an inverse fourier transform was performed .",
    "the velocity field computed this way was then used with two density cubes , one with @xmath101 and the other being the uniform density cube , to simulate two ppv data sets .",
    "velocity centroids for both cases were then computed and their power spectra are shown in fig .  [ fig_bent_centroide ] .",
    "for the uniform density case , unsurprisingly , the power spectrum of the velocity centroid has zero dispersion and exhibits exactly the same variation as that of the full 3d velocity field . for the @xmath101 case , despite the dispersion , the behaviour remains , showing the consistency of the method , even for isotropic velocity fields with non - power - law power spectra .    as a second extension of the types of fields tested , density cubes with increased fluctuations",
    "were built by exponentiation of fbm fields , resulting in lognormal distributions .",
    "the original fbm field used had an index @xmath102 and the resulting density values ranged from @xmath103  1  @xmath104 to @xmath103  2500  @xmath104 , with a mean of @xmath103  90  @xmath104 .",
    "this density cube was used in conjunction with all of our fbm velocity fields to compute ppv data sets and velocity centroids , the power spectra of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_centroide_lognormal ] . for such large density fluctuations ,",
    "the dispersion is noticeably increased with respect to the fbm case , but the main result that @xmath105 holds when averaging in wavevector space .",
    "considering the possibility that the complete agreement between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , without @xmath1 entering into the picture , could be caused by the absence of density - velocity correlations , we chose to compute 3d density and velocity fbm fields featuring a certain level of correlation .",
    "the way we did this is based on the idea that most , if not all , of the spatial structure of images is contained in the structure of their fourier phases . starting from this , we introduced correlations between two fbms by setting a number of phase points to the same value in both fields .",
    "the points were chosen randomly , and their number varied between 10% and 90% of the total number of pixels .",
    "the amplitudes were computed separately .",
    "once again , we found that the velocity centroid spectral index was exactly the same as that of the three - dimensional velocity field , whatever the density spectral index , and whatever the amount of correlations . from this remarkable result",
    "we infer that velocity centroids are robust observables for recovering 3d velocity statistics from optically thin lines .",
    "this result has obvious applications for studies of ism statistical properties and of interstellar turbulence ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we are aware that the method used to introduce density - velocity correlation in our simulations does not comply with ( magneto-)hydrodynamics , as for instance high densities would correspond to high velocities along the line of sight , but this technique allows us to test easily various correlation degrees while staying in the fbm scheme",
    ". obviously , it would be useful to make a similar analysis on physically relevant fields , such as mhd simulations , to study the effects on the centroid velocity power spectrum of physical density - velocity correlation , sharper density / velocity contrasts and non - gaussian statistics , and thus assess the robustness of this result in more realistic conditions .",
    "one should also keep in mind that our results may not be generally applicable to all interstellar conditions .",
    "for instance the statistical properties of centroid velocity maps can be significantly affected by systematic motions like rotation or expansion , if proven not to be part of the turbulent cascade itself . in this case , such systematic velocity fields should be filtered prior to any analysis of turbulent motions @xcite .",
    "[ section_correl ]      in a recent study , lp00 showed that , for gaussian random fields , the spectral index of the 3d velocity field can be determined by studying the variation of the spectral index of velocity slices is the integrated emission of the ppv cube between @xmath45 and @xmath106 . ] as a function of their thickness @xmath107 .",
    "subsequently , @xcite and @xcite analyzed and confirmed this proposition using mhd simulations .",
    "in both these works the power spectrum of the simulated velocity field is forced to be a power law ( a method called spectral modification ) to extend the limited power law range of mhd simulations .",
    "this method preserves the phase information and thus much of the expensively - obtained physics .",
    "we propose here to also test the theoretical predictions of lp00 on fbm simulations , because they have intrinsically well defined power spectra and obey gaussian statistics , the working hypotheses of lp00 .      the main prediction of lp00 deals with what they call _ thin _ and _ thick _ velocity slices of the ppv data cube .",

    "obviously , a velocity slice will be fully thin if all sampled scales are larger than @xmath114 , and fully thick if the largest scale in the map is smaller than @xmath114 .    at that point",

    "however , the narrow range of scales over which the velocity slices are thin makes the comparison with the predictions uneasy .",
    "furthermore , the power spectra of velocity slices for @xmath124 move away from the lp00 prediction at small scale , because these velocity slices are becoming very thick at those scales .",
    "this behavior is indeed correlated with @xmath1 .",
    "another feature of fig .",
    "[ fig_ps_deltav_allgamma ] is the increase of power at small scales for @xmath119 , due to shot - noise .",
    "the computation of ppv cubes from finite size 3d velocity fields leads to an artificial increase of high - frequency fluctuations in channel maps @xcite . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "the limited size of the simulated lines of sight introduces sharp edges and almost empty channels in the ppv cube .",
    "this effect is more important with a small effective spectral resolution .",

    "as expected , the amplitude of this high - frequency component increases when the size of the 3d fields decreases .",
    "this effect biases the determination of simulated channel maps power spectra .",
    "one solution to reduce the effects of shot - noise is to apply a gaussian smoothing to the ppv spectra , simulating the effect of thermal broadening .",

    "the @xmath119 case is particularly interesting as velocity slices are thin at all scales as long as @xmath135 ( see eq .",

    "this allows for a separate study of the effect of gaussian smoothing on shot - noise reduction and velocity slice thinness .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_shot_noise ] shows that gaussian smoothing significantly dampens shot - noise .",
    "up to a temperature of 500 k the power spectrum steepens through reduction of the shot - noise effect , but it seems that , even at this temperature , shot - noise has not been completely removed . at higher temperatures , the condition @xmath139 would not be met any longer .    the bottom panel of fig .",

    "some kind of plateau is observed in both cases within the thick regime , but not at the predicted @xmath142 value .",
    "this is due to the fact that the smallest scales are actually becoming very thick .",
    "this is why , in the case of @xmath124 , the curves are dependent on @xmath1 and do not converge to the same value .      except for @xmath81",
    ", we have seen that shot - noise has a limited effect on our simulations because of the gaussian smoothing applied . but",
    "this is at the expense of a narrowing of the accessible thin regime : fully thin velocity slices with @xmath120 are present only when @xmath81 , in these conditions , the interpretation of the @xmath140 vs @xmath107 curves ( see figures  [ fig_shot_noise ] and [ fig_thinthick ] ) is ambiguous , which makes the determination of @xmath3 very difficult .",
    "the power spectra of fully thick velocity slices can actually depend on @xmath1 , which makes it impossible to deduce @xmath3 from @xmath142 using eq .",
    "[ eq_laz2 ] . therefore , due to the relative thickness of velocity slices in our simulations , we could not demonstrate whether the lp00 method can be used to determine @xmath3 .",
    "one practical limitation of the lp00 method , however , is that it requires to find out whether or not the fully thin regime is reached , for a given observation .",
    "if a significant asymptotic plateau is found at small @xmath107 in the @xmath140 vs @xmath107 curves , one might think that it is the case .",
    "but unfortunately , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_thinthick ] , such a plateau could also be observed in the thick regime , and this could lead to a wrong estimate of @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , the only way to estimate the position of the transition scale @xmath114 between the two regimes for a given velocity slice is by using eq .",
    "[ eq_l_thin ] , which requires @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , there is no independent way to determine whether thin velocity slices have been reached or not . in that respect",
    ", the determination of @xmath3 in the small magellanic cloud by @xcite might be questionable as they do not seem to reach the thin asymptotic regime .",
    "it is important to estimate in what conditions lp00 s method could be used on real observations , for a typical high latitude hi cloud for instance .",
    "we have shown that the narrowest relevant velocity slice for this analysis has a width of @xmath143 ( here we consider that the effective spectral resolution is dominated by the thermal broadening ) . but to estimate @xmath3 using lp00 s method one must have a plateau at small @xmath107 in the @xmath144 vs @xmath107 curve , which calls for fully thin velocity slices on a significant range of @xmath107 , lets say for @xmath145 .",
    "we recall that velocity slices are thin at scales @xmath146 where @xmath147 . therefore to evaluate on what scales lp00 s method could be used to deduce @xmath3 , one must assess what is @xmath114 for a velocity slice of @xmath148 .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the energy spectrum of hi is compatible with the @xcite cascade ( @xmath149 ) . in these conditions ,",
    "@xmath114 for a velocity slice of @xmath150 is @xmath151 the normalisation factor @xmath152 can be estimated from high - latitude hi observations like in @xcite , where the internal velocity dispersion at a scale of 1 pc is of the order of 4 km  s@xmath52 , significantly larger than that observed in molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "if we consider cold neutral medium ( cnm ) gas at t=100 k , the smallest thin scale @xmath114 for a cloud at a distance of 100 pc is @xmath153 , which is significantly larger than the angular resolution ( 1 ) of the 21 cm radio - interferometer at dominion radio astrophysical observatory ( drao ) . furthermore ,",
    "if we consider the presence of warmer gas ( warm neutral medium ( @xmath154 - 8000 k ) or thermally unstable hi ( @xmath155 k ) ) , the thermal broadening would increase @xmath114 ( which scales as @xmath156 ) and make the determination of @xmath3 using the lp00 method only possible at scales larger than a few degrees , at least for hi in the solar neighborhood . in this respect , the velocity centroid method is better suited to determine the 3d velocity power spectrum as it does not depend at all on the gas temperature and on the thickness of the velocity slices in the observation . therefore the velocity centroid method allows the determination of the velocity power spectrum down to the angular resolution of the observations .",
    "in this paper three - dimensional fbms with various spectral indexes were used to simulate interstellar 3d density and velocity fields . from these we computed several spectro - imagery observations assuming optically thin line emission .",
    "our results confirm that the spectral index @xmath0 of the integrated emission is the same as that of the 3d density field @xmath1 , when the depth @xmath86 of the medium probed along the line of sight is at least of the order of the largest transverse scale observed . for smaller depths ,",
    "the power spectrum of the integrated emission shows two asymptotic slopes of @xmath1 and @xmath95 at small and large scales respectively , with the transition occurring at a frequency @xmath157 .",
    "this property of the power spectrum of integrated emission could be used to estimate the depth of interstellar clouds and to infer the 3d statistical properties of optically thick media .",
    "the main result of our study is that the spectral index of the maps of line centroid velocities is the same as that of the 3d velocity field .",
    "this result is particularly robust because it holds for any gas temperature and whether density - velocity correlations are present or not .",
    "this similarity is also recovered if the power spectrum of the 3d velocity field is not a power law or if the density fluctuations follow a lognormal distribution .",
    "this remarkable property of optically thin media may be used to estimate the 3d energy spectrum of interstellar turbulence in various ism environments .",
    "we also compare the power spectra of velocity slices with the predictions of lp00 . due to the limited resolution of our simulations",
    "we are not able to confirm their predictions . on the other hand",
    "we show that the method proposed by lp00 is in practice barely applicable to real observations , and we suggest that a more robust determination of 3d velocity statistics lies with velocity centroids .",
    "in our case where the medium under study is optically thin , the integrated emission map is simply the sum of all velocity channels : @xmath158 using eq .",
    "[ eq_ppv ] , reverting the order of summations over @xmath87 and @xmath61 , and with our values of @xmath159 and @xmath62 , this translates into @xmath160 where @xmath5 is a numerical coefficient coming from the unit conversion .",
    "the important point is that @xmath161 is proportional to the sum over @xmath87 of the 3d density cube , which by construction is a fbm with spectral index @xmath1 . to compute the spectral index @xmath0 of the integrated emission",
    ", we consider the limit for which the summation can be replaced by an integral over @xmath87 @xmath162 writing the fourier transform of the 3d density as a function of the three - dimensional wave vector @xmath21 , we have @xmath163 which becomes , if we consider the @xmath164 cut through @xmath165 and integrate first over @xmath87 , @xmath166 meaning that the fourier transform of @xmath161 is proportional to the @xmath164 cut through @xmath167 .",
