    "the root length formula is such that if one moves a single box of a mixed - symmetry young tableau one column to the left the root length squared is reduced by two .",

    "this is the same pattern that occurred in the gauge fields used to construct the action for the dual graviton tower of gravitational degrees of freedom highlighted in section 3 .",

    "it is not a coincidence that the sets of fields identified within @xmath2 and those required to constrain the off - shell degrees of freedom are the same . in both cases",
    "it is the same consideration of identifying the irreducible highest weight representations that singles out the sets of fields .",
    "so we expect the gauge fields required to construct the curtright action for the tower of dual graviton fields to match the fields which appear in @xmath2 at the same level as the multi - dual graviton generator .",

    "the set of fields required to guarantee that the double - dual graviton propagates the correct number of degrees of freedom is given in equation ( [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "there are two novel aspects that appear in the construction of the action for the double - dual graviton .    *",
    "the double - dual action retains a number of mixed - symmetry fields on top of the @xmath81-irreducible @xmath474 $ ] field .",
    "these extra fields are required for consistency of the action principle and correct number of propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "they are not auxiliary in the sense that their equations of motion can not be solved algebraically in terms of the @xmath474 $ ] field , however they can be eliminated on - shell by differential gauge symmetries .",
    "the detailed mechanism will be explained elsewhere @xcite using the frame formulation .",
    "such a situation did not occur for the parent actions of @xcite . *",
    "the action retains an unfixed parameter @xmath181 , which corresponds to the possibility of adding total derivative terms to the curtright lagrangian when expressed in terms of the curl @xmath475}(c)\\,$ ] .",
    "the relation between two different child actions can be viewed as a legendre transformation . at certain values of @xmath208 ,",
    "the legendre transformation becomes non - invertible .",
    "this is what happens for the two values @xmath476 and @xmath477 given after ( [ acoeff ] ) .",
    "fixing a non - singular value for @xmath208 in ( [ acren ] ) will correspondingly fix it in the lagrangian of ( [ fin2 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the double - dual graviton there exists an infinite tower of dual fields each carrying the gravitational degrees of freedom , this was observed in section [ sec : mtimes ] .",
    "these infinite towers carry representations of the little group @xmath478 in @xmath114 dimensions which are non - trivial and all equivalent to the spin-2 @xmath478-irrep through multiplication / contraction by a number of @xmath478 metric tensors and antisymmetric @xmath478 symbols .",
    "correspondingly , the @xmath81-covariant field equations will feature high powers of the trace operations on the curvature tensor @xmath479 , as was proposed in @xcite . in this context",
    ", the recent paper @xcite also considered the @xmath480 tower of fields obtained by attaching columns of length @xmath269 to the young diagrams associated with a finite - dimensional algebra @xmath481 , and under some assumptions concluded that these fields carry no propagating degrees of freedom . we think that the present analysis might be relevant in this context , as we have seen , for example , that the double - dual graviton possesses , as a subset of its complete set of gauge parameters , those of a type-@xmath474 $ ] labastida - like gauge field . that covariant equations of motion relevant for mixed  symmetry gauge fields can bring in higher powers of the traces of the curvature tensors of the labastida equations",
    "was found in @xcite .",
    "it is thanks to this reformulation of the labastida equations that it became possible to prove that the labastida equations are actually correct , ensuring unitarity and absence of ghosts , see @xcite and detailed discussions therein . ]",
    "is a feature that might be taken into account in trying to build an @xmath2-invariant off - shell formulation of supergravity . in this work",
    "we did not investigate the possibility of building an action invariant under @xmath27 and such that only one graviton would propagate on - shell in the spin-2 sector , but we hope that our results can be useful for that goal . in any case ,",
    "our results show that the labastida formulation is not the only relevant one for such a purpose .",
    "we characterise three towers of fields as the fierz ",
    "pauli tower shown in equation ( [ fptower ] ) which is derived from the linearised graviton , the dual graviton tower shown in equation ( [ curttower ] ) which is derived from the dual graviton and the double - dual tower shown in equation ( [ doubledualtower ] ) which is derived from the double - dual graviton .",
    "the dual graviton tower was first recognised as an inifinite set of dual graviton fields in @xcite where they were identified within the algebra of @xmath2 . in this paper",
    "we presented the steps required to construct the linearised action associated with any of the fields in each of the three gravity towers .",
    "the set of fields required to write down the off - shell action grows with the number of dualisations needed to relate the field to the graviton . the actions ,",
    "although they propagate the same degrees of freedom as the graviton , contain many more fields .",
    "in @xcite towers of fields dual to the membrane and the fivebrane gauge fields of eleven - dimensional supergravity were also found within @xmath2 and dual actions can be constructed in the same manner for these infinite sets of fields as for the dual graviton tower using the prescription given in this paper .",
    "the work presented here was , in part , inspired by the argument that the strong coupling limit of five dimensional maximal supergravity contains the double - dual graviton @xcite .",
    "it was expected that the corner of m - theory identified by the strong coupling limit with a six - dimensional @xmath20 superconformal theory would be discovered within @xmath2 .",
    "however no such double - dual graviton is contained within @xmath2 , instead the dual graviton tower of multi - dual graviton fields @xcite are the only candidate dual gravity fields .",
    "we showed in section [ sec : e11 notes ] that first of the dual gravity fields , @xmath427\\nu[2]\\rho}$ ] in five dimensions , whose symmetries are described by the young tableau @xmath482 propagate the same @xmath483 degrees of freedom as the double - dual graviton @xmath484\\nu[2]}$ ] whose symmetries are those of the young tableau @xmath485 .",

    "these are similar to the arguments which were made by hull @xcite for the double - dual graviton .",
    "it was emphasised above that the linearised action for the double - dual graviton retained a number of supplementary mixed - symmetry fields .",

    "the same is true of the first field in the dual graviton tower of dualities , namely in five - dimensions the @xmath482 and a set of mixed symmetry fields expected to be retained in the corresponding action are listed in equation ( [ c1 ] ) .",
    "the construction of @xmath2 rests upon the serre relations , see equation ( [ serre ] ) , which guarantee the irreducibility of any representation of @xmath2 .",

    "it is not coincidental that the same sets of mixed symmetry fields required for the action of the @xmath482 in five dimensions are also contained within @xmath2 .",
