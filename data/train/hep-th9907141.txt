    "the considerable theoretical interest in the recent suggestion  @xcite of possible extra dimensions of macroscopic ( sub  millimetre ) size stems largely from the apparent extreme difficulty of ruling out such a suggestion experimentally .",

    "one of the most important features of this approach is the induced light  cone fluctuations  @xcite , which may be detectable as stochastic fluctuations in the velocity of light propagating through this `` medium '' .",
