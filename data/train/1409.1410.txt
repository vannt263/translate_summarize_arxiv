    "higher - order curvature theories of gravity have gained a lot of attention . not surprisingly , the mere extension of general relativity in higher dimensions can immediately lead to a wide variety of alternative theories of gravity whose actions contain higher - order curvature terms .",
    "the inclusion of higher curvature terms in the gravitational action increases further the diversity of the models available and gives rise to a rich phenomenology , which is actively investigated these days . amongst the higher curvature theories of gravity , lovelock theory @xcite which is the most general second - order gravity theory in higher - dimensional spacetimes",
    "has attracted a lot of attention .",
    "the action imposed in this theory is consistent with the corrections inspired by string theory to einstein - hilbert action @xcite .",
    "the most extensively researches are done on einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity with second - order curvature corrections @xcite .",
    "although the lagrangian and field equations look complicated in third - order lovelock gravity , there are a large number of works on introducing and discussing various exact black hole solutions of third - order lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "it is known that the second - order lovelock gravity admits supersymmetric extension @xcite , while all the higher orders of this theory have only the necessary condition of supersymmetric extension suplg . throughout the recent years ,",
    "most of the interesting holographic aspects of lovelock gravity have been studied @xcite .",
    "recently , some works have been extended to general lovelock gravity to investigate the solutions and their properties @xcite .",
    "although most of the known black hole solutions of lovelock gravity are those with curvature constant horizons , one may raise the question of having black hole solutions with nonconstant curvature . here , specially , we investigate black hole solutions with einstein horizon . in four dimensions ,",
    "the first explicit inhomogeneous compact einstein metric was constructed by page @xcite and a higher - dimensional version of the method of page was given in @xcite .",
    "bohm constructed an infinite family of inhomogeneous metrics with positive scalar curvature on products of spheres @xcite .",
    "after that , examples in higher - dimensional spacetimes have been worked in refs .",
    "the properties of such einstein manifolds are investigated in five and higher dimensions in refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in black hole solutions of third - order lovelock gravity whose horizons are einstein manifolds of nonconstant curvature . in einstein gravity , no new solution can be obtained with nonconstant - curvature boundary .",
    "this is due to the fact that the einstein equation deals with the ricci tensor and therefore the weyl tensor does not appear in the field equation .",
    "on the other hand , the riemann tensor has direct contribution in the field equation of lovelock gravity , and therefore the weyl tensor appears in the field equation of lovelock gravity . in ref .",
    "dotti dotti and gleiser obtained a condition on an invariant built out of the weyl tensor in gauss - bonnet gravity when the horizon is an einstein manifold .",
    "this constraint appears in the metric and consequently changes the properties of the spacetime .",
    "the properties of such static and dynamical solutions in einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) gravity have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "also the magnetic black hole that has space with such specific condition was obtained in @xcite .",
    "while the base manifold of black hole solutions in egb gravity with a generic value of the coupling constant must be necessarily einstein , the boundary admits a wider class of geometries in the special case when the coupling constant is such that the theory admits a unique maximally symmetric solution @xcite .",
    "the birkhoff s theorem in six - dimensional egb gravity for the case of nonconstant - curvature horizons with various features has been investigated in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the horizons of black holes of lovelock gravity in the chern - simons case @xcite in odd dimensions are not restricted .",
    "some specific examples of black holes of lovelock - born - infeld gravity @xcite with non - einstein horizons in even dimensions were found in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the base manifolds of these black hole solutions possess more than one curvature scale provided avoiding tensor restrictions on the base manifold and allowing at most a reduced set of scalar constraints on it .",
    "while all the lovelock coefficients in lovelock - chern - simons and lovelock - born - infeld gravity are given in term of the cosmological constant , here we do not impose any condition on the coupling constants of lovelock gravity and generalize the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite to the case of third - order lovelock gravity with arbitrary lovelock coefficients .",
    "that is , we like to obtain the black hole solutions of third - order lovelock gravity with arbitrary coupling constants and nonconstant - curvature horizons .",
    "we predict that the appearing higher - curvature terms in third - order lovelock gravity , even more sharply , may cause novel changes in the properties of the spacetime .",
    "this is the motivation for obtaining new black hole solutions in third - order lovelock gravity with nonconstant - curvature horizons and investigating their thermodynamic properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in the following section we begin with a brief review of the field equation in third - order lovelock gravity and obtain the equations getting use of the expressions in warped geometry for our spacetime ansatz . in sec .",

    "section [ stab ] is devoted to the analysis of local and global stabilities by considering the variation of temperature versus entropy and the free energy for the special case of @xmath0 .",
    "we finish our paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "the most fundamental assumption in standard general relativity is the requirement that the field equations should be generally covariant and contain at most a second - order derivative of the metric .",
    "based on this principle , the most general classical theory of gravitation in @xmath1 dimensions is lovelock gravity @xcite .",
