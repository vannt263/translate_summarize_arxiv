    "in 2001 the low mass x - ray binary ks  1731@xmath0  went into quiescence @xcite after accreting steadily since its first detection about 12 years prior @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the neutron star crust would be heated out of thermal equilibrium with the core during this long outburst , and that monitoring observations could detect the thermal relaxation of the crust following the cessation of accretion .",
    "a regular monitoring program of ks  1731@xmath0  with chandra and xmm @xcite has indeed detected a steadily decaying luminosity .",
    "another source , mxb  1659@xmath1 , has also been observed to cool following a 2.5  yr - long outburst @xcite , and recent observations show that the cooling appears to have halted @xcite .",
    "recently a third source , ax  j1754.2@xmath2 , was observed to turn off @xcite after being in outburst since being detected in 1999 @xcite .",
    "this source is likely an ultracompact binary , and is of particular interest as it may be similar to 1h  1905@xmath3 , which has an extremely low quiescent flux , perhaps indicating a very low neutron star core temperature @xcite . finally , the rapidly accreting source xte  j1701@xmath4 went into quiescence in 2007 after @xmath5 of active accretion @xcite , and exo  0748@xmath6 entered quiescence in 2008 after being in outburst for 24@xmath7@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "@xcite emphasized that observations of the crust cooling would offer a new probe of the crust thermal properties .",
    "the crust of a neutron star in a lmxb may have significantly different properties than that of a young isolated neutron star , as the accretion lifetime of a lmxb is long enough for accreted matter to replace the entire crust .",
    "the accreted crust is heated during outburst by electron captures and pycnonuclear reactions , mostly at densities close to neutron drip @xcite .",
    "the temperature profile in the crust is determined by how the heat released in this `` deep crustal heating '' is transported outwards to the surface or inwards to the neutron star core , where it is radiated as neutrinos .",
    "a particularly uncertain property of accreted crusts is the thermal conductivity .",
    "the matter entering the top of the crust is expected to consist of a mixture of elements produced by hydrogen and helium burning at low densities .",
    "@xcite found that rp - process burning produced ashes with @xmath9 , where the impurity parameter @xmath10 measures the distribution of nuclide charge numbers , an important parameter for setting the conductivity of the crust @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that at such large values of @xmath11 , the crust would have an amorphous structure , with a low thermal conductivity comparable to the conductivity of the liquid state .",
    "recent molecular dynamics calculations of the solidification of such a mixture @xcite show , however , that a regular crystal structure does form , but that phase separation between the liquid and solid phases or the formation of multiple solid phases can occur , changing the effective value of @xmath12  in the crust compared to the rp - process mixture .",
    "in addition , nuclear reactions in the crust may also act to reduce the effective value of @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "measurement of @xmath11 in the crust would therefore give an important test of the composition of rp - process ashes and their subsequent evolution as they are compressed towards nuclear density .",
    "@xcite compared time - dependent calculations of deep crustal heating and subsequent cooling to the observations of ks  1731@xmath0 .",
    "they found that a low value of thermal conductivity corresponding to an amorphous crust could be ruled out because it would give cooling on a much longer timescale than observed . in this paper",
    ", we confirm this result , and go further by describing the basic physics that sets the shape of the cooling lightcurve , and calculating in detail the constraints on @xmath11 and other crust parameters coming from the cooling lightcurves of both ks  1731@xmath0  and mxb  1659@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite found that both of these decays could be fit with an exponential decay to a constant , although a single power - law ( @xmath13 , with @xmath14 ) also adequately fits the data for ks  1731@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "we show here that the lightcurve of a cooling crust is a broken power law .",
    "the initial power law decay gives a direct measure of the temperature profile , and hence the thermal flux during outburst , in the outer crust .",
    "the time of the break , at hundreds of days post - outburst , corresponds to the thermal time where the solid transitions from a classical to quantum crystal , close to neutron drip . at late times , the luminosity levels off at a value set by the neutron star core temperature .",
    "we start in  2 by describing our time - dependent cooling calculations and an analytic model of the results , and go on in  3 to calculate the constraints on crust parameters coming from comparison with the observed cooling of ks  1731@xmath0  and mxb  1659@xmath1 .",
    "the appendix discusses the details of our crust models .",
    "because the temperature is always low relative to the electron and neutron fermi energies , we can solve for the temperature and luminosity using a hydrostatic structure . in the crust",
    ", the pressure @xmath15 makes a convenient eulerian coordinate , and we integrate the equations @xcite for the radius @xmath16 , gravitational mass @xmath17 , and potential @xmath18 , @xmath19 here @xmath20^{-1/2}$ ] , @xmath21 is the gravitational acceleration , and @xmath22 is the density of mass - energy .",

    "we solve these equations using the method of lines .",
    "we use the common technique of defining @xmath41 at the midpoints of our grid by interpolating @xmath42 and differencing @xmath43 ; as a result the divergence term in equation  ( [ e.temperature ] ) is second - order and explicitly conserves flux .",

    "our calculation of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38  is described in the appendix .",
    "we used two different boundary conditions for the core .",
    "the first is to simply assume a constant temperature , which we fit to observations .",
    "the second is to match the inwards luminosity at the crust - core boundary to the neutrino emission from the core using a tabulated @xmath44-@xmath45 relation for different assumptions of the core neutrino emissivity . in this way",
    ", we self - consistently solve for the core temperature appropriate for the assumed core physics rather than treat it as a free parameter . unless the quiescent interval is long , we find that the core temperature is essentially constant over an outburst - quiescence cycle .",
    "the boundary condition at the surface is more ambiguous . during an outburst ,",
    "the temperature in the neutron star envelope is set by the burning of hydrogen and helium , and ( possibly ) fusion of light elements such as @xmath46 .",
    "our code does not track this burning , and so we fix the temperature at @xmath47 at a fixed value @xmath31 . this column is roughly where superburst ignition occurs , and should demarcate the bottom of the region containing light element , unstable reactions . because our first goal is to fit the lightcurve , for now we do not set @xmath31 to any expected value _ a priori _ , but rather leave it as an adjustable parameter .    during quiescence",
    ", we calculate the cooling flux at the top of the grid using a tabulated relation between @xmath48  and the temperature obtained by integrating the steady - state thermal structure of the neutron star envelope @xcite . in these integrations",
    ", we fix the envelope to be pure @xmath49  down to a depth @xmath50 , with a layer of pure @xmath51  down to a depth @xmath47 . the resulting relation ( fig .",

    "this increase in the inner crust temperature leads to a hotter outer crust , with a shallower temperature gradient , giving a lightcurve that falls less quickly .",
    "as figure [ f.qmap ] shows , the correlations between the fitted parameters are such that larger @xmath12  values lead to lower values of @xmath44 and @xmath90 , i.e. to compensate for the delayed cooling due to increase in @xmath12 , the overall temperature scale set by @xmath44 and @xmath90 decreases . in ks  1731@xmath0 , the probability distribution of @xmath12  has a peak at a similar value to mxb  1659@xmath1 , but with a long tail to small values of @xmath12 .",

    "the reason that the fitted effective temperatures depend on distance is that the peak of the thermal spectrum lies outside the x - ray band , making the fitted temperature sensitive to the overall luminosity scale . to investigate the effect of such systematic variations",
    ", we have calculated the constraints on the models with the effective temperatures for mxb  1659@xmath1  all decreased or increased by 20% .",

    "@xmath12  must decrease , cooling the inner crust by making it easier for heat to be conducted into the core .",
    "the values of @xmath153 derived from the cooling curves match well with the accretion rates derived from observations of the persistent x - ray luminosity during outburst . for mxb  1659@xmath1 ,",

    "a separate check on this value is that at a flux level of @xmath167 , a very regular sequence of x - ray bursts was seen , similar to the source gs  1826 - 24 , which is known for being a very regular burster .",
    "assuming an ignition mass of @xmath168 for these regular bursts , which had a recurrence time of @xmath169 , we find @xmath170 , consistent with the x - ray flux . during the final @xmath171 year of the outburst ,",

    "in this appendix , we describe how we calculate the different pieces of microphysics that go into the crust models .",
    "we compute the equation of state for the degenerate , relativistic electrons by interpolation from tables of the free energy @xcite .",
    "for the ions we compute the eos using the free energy fit of @xcite for the liquid state and the fit of @xcite for the crystalline state . with this choice of fits ,",
    "the freezing point occurs where the free energies in the liquid and solid phase are equal , namely @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the ion - sphere radius .",
    "note that our fit to the liquid - phase free energy does not include corrections @xcite based on recent monte carlo simulations @xcite . as a result ,",
    "our liquid - phase free - energy is slightly larger ( by 0.005% at @xmath206 ) than the expression of @xcite , and our freezing point is slightly higher than the value of @xmath207 determined by @xcite .",
    "although we use the value of @xmath97 at the freezing point determined by the ion free energy for a one - component plasma ( ocp ) , it is important to note that the freezing point may differ significantly from this value because of polarization of the electron background @xcite and because the crust consists of a mixture of isotopes .",
    "indeed , recent molecular dynamics simulations @xcite find that the freezing temperature for a mixture appropriate for x - ray burst ashes is smaller than the ocp , with @xmath208 at freezing .",
    "we include the debye reduction in the ion specific heat using an interpolation formula , and compute the debye temperature according to @xcite . in the inner crust , we compute the neutron specific heat as that of a degenerate gas , with suppression due to the pairing interaction @xcite . for the @xmath209 pairing of free neutrons in the inner crust , we approximate the critical temperature as a gaussian in the neutron fermi wavevector , which approximates the calculation of @xcite .",
    "the crust temperatures achieved in the models presented here lie below the critical temperature throughout most of the crust , and the neutrons do not contribute significantly to the total specific heat .",
    "the composition of accreting neutron star crusts has been calculated previously by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they find that the composition of the crust changes abruptly with depth , at locations corresponding to thresholds for electron capture or pycnonuclear reactions . rather than model the neutron star crust as a series of distinct layers",
    ", we instead fit the composition so that @xmath210 and @xmath211 are smoothly varying functions of @xmath212 .",
    "this approximation has a negligible effect on our results , but makes the integration simpler as it avoids jumps in the thermal properties . in the outer crust , we set the mass number @xmath211 and compute @xmath210 in order to maintain @xmath213-equilibrium . using a simple liquid - drop model for the nuclear binding energy , @xmath214 and minimizing the nucleon - specific gibbs free energy @xmath215 of a cell containing a nucleus and @xmath210 electrons with respect to @xmath210 for a fixed @xmath211 , we obtain the electron fraction @xmath216 in the outer crust as a function of electron chemical potential @xmath217 , @xmath218 where we take and @xmath219 by fitting experimental binding energies using the calculator at http://128.95.95.61/\\textasciitilde intuser / ld.html[http://128.95.95.61/\\textasciitilde intuser / ld.html ] . ] @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",

    "the relation between chemical potential , @xmath216 , and the abundance of free neutrons @xmath222  becomes more complicated .",
    "we find that the tables in @xcite are adequately fit by defining @xmath223 as the total number of nucleons ( including free neutrons ) per nucleus and setting @xmath224 and @xmath223 increasing as @xmath225 up to a maximum value set by the total number of pycnonuclear reactions that occur in the crust .",
    "we set a floor to @xmath226 of 0.03 , and take @xmath227 , where @xmath228 is the mean mass number in the outer crust .",
    "figure [ f.composition ] shows an example of a crust composition with @xmath229 and @xmath230 in the inner crust , where we choose @xmath231 to agree with the calculation of ( * ? ? ?",
    "[ f.composition ] , _ open circles _ ) .",
    "following @xcite , we define a smooth heating distribution in the crust , rather than resolving the heating from individual reaction layers .",
    "we choose our heating function to be such that @xmath232 , and we do this separately in both the inner crust , and in the outer crust where the pressure is @xmath233 .",
    "the integrated nuclear luminosity is plotted in fig .",

    "we normalized the heat distribution so that the total heat deposited , per accreted nucleon , into the inner crust is @xmath234 ( cf .",

    "* ) and the total heat deposited , per accreted nucleon , into the outer crust is @xmath235 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for the neutrino cooling ,",
    "our model includes ( for a review of neutrino emission mechanisms , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) neutrino cooling from electron - nucleus bremsstrahlung .",
    "the neutrino emissivity from neutrons paired in the @xmath209 state in the inner crust is suppressed by a factor @xmath236 @xcite .",
    "recent calculations @xcite show that this suppression follows from conservation of baryon vector current .",
    "the pair , photo , and plasmon emissivities @xcite do not contribute substantially at the temperatures of interest .",
    "our implementation of the thermal conductivities mediated by electron - ion scattering follows that of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we compute the electron thermal transport in the relaxation - time approximation , @xmath237 where @xmath238 , with @xmath239 being the fermi momentum , and @xmath240 is the scattering frequency . in the ocean , @xmath240 is set by electron - ion scattering .",
    "as the ions crystallize , electron - phonon scattering mediates the thermal transport .",
    "where the temperature is above the debye temperature , the scattering frequency is approximately @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the fine - structure constant . in the inner crust ,",
    "the electron - ion scattering frequency is strongly reduced for @xmath243 , the plasma temperature , and impurity scattering becomes dominant with scattering frequency @xmath244 where @xmath239 and @xmath245 are the momentum and velocity of electrons at the fermi surface and the impurity parameter @xmath246 measures the distribution of nuclide charge numbers .",
    "although we do include electron - electron scattering @xcite in our calculation , it does not affect the overall thermal conductivity .    for the coulomb logarithm term",
    "@xmath247 we use the formula of @xcite with the modification that the structure factor is set to unity , reflecting the lack of long - range correlations in the impurities . with this modification @xmath247",
    "becomes ( potekhin , private communication ) @xmath248       \\ln\\left(1+\\frac{4k_{\\mathrm{f}}^{2}}{q_{s}^{2}}\\right ) - \\beta^{2 } - \\frac{1+\\beta^{2}(q_{s}/2k_{\\mathrm{f}})^{2}}{1+(q_{s}/2k_{\\mathrm{f}})^{2}}\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath249 is the fermi wavevector , @xmath250 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath251 is the thomas - fermi wavevector . as noted by @xcite , this gives a result for the coulomb logarithm that is similar to that proposed by @xcite .",
    "the two formulae agree if one makes the substitution @xmath252 , where @xmath205 is the mean inter - nuclei spacing , in the fit by @xcite .",
    "the thomas - fermi screening length exceeds the inter - nuclei spacing and produces a larger @xmath247 ( by about a factor of 2 ) and hence a lower thermal conductivity than does the fit by @xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations @xcite using a mixture of rp - process ashes @xcite , find that the impurities are not distributed uniformly . as a result , @xcite compute a thermal conductivity that is @xmath253 lower than that computed assuming a one - component plasma and impurities computed with the static structure factor of @xcite .    finally , @xcite recently calculated the thermal conductivity in the inner crust due to superfluid heat conduction .",
    "their figure 2 shows that , for @xmath254 , superfluid heat conduction is comparable to heat conduction by electrons for @xmath255 , where @xmath256 is the neutron drip density , and less important at lower temperatures .",
    "therefore , we do not expect that our results would change significantly if superfluid heat conduction was included , unlike the case of magnetars , for which the strong magnetic field suppresses electron transport perpendicular to the magnetic field ."
