    "in the course of last ten years many results of the classical geometric approach to integrable partial differential equations @xcite has been transfered to the discrete setting ( see @xcite and references therein ) . the key role in the theory has been attributed to the multidimensional quadrilateral lattice @xcite , which is the discrete analog @xcite of a conjugate net @xcite .",
    "it turns out that integrability of the quadrilateral lattice is encoded in a very simple geometric statement , visualized on figure  [ fig : titjtkx ] .",

    "then there exists the unique point @xmath12 which belongs simultaneously to the three planes @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .        despite of ( or , thanks to ) extremely simple formulation of the geometric integrability scheme , the corresponding nonlinear discrete system ( the discrete darboux equations ) turns out to be the generic discrete system integrable by the nonlocal @xmath16-dressing method @xcite . also the finite - gap integration scheme , a standard tool in the integrable systems theory @xcite ,",
    "can be applied to that system in its pure form @xcite .",
    "we mention that the _ differential _ darboux equations , which have appeared first in projective differential geometry of multidimensional conjugate nets @xcite , play an important role @xcite in the multicomponent kadomtsev ",
    "petviashvilii ( kp ) hierarchy , which is commonly considered @xcite as the fundamental system of equations in integrability theory .",
    "integrable reductions of the quadrilateral lattice ( and thus of the discrete darboux equations ) arise from additional constraints which are compatible with the geometric integrability scheme . in @xcite",
    "we isolated the incidence geometry theorems which are responsible for the basic reductions of the quadrilateral lattice : b- and c - reductions providing geometric interpretation for bkp and ckp hierarchies @xcite , and the so called quadratic reduction .",
    "on the geometric level there is no essential difference between the quadrilateral lattice construction and between its darboux - type transformations @xcite . in particular",
    ", all classical transformations of conjugate nets @xcite have found their quadrilateral lattice analogs and have been shown to be reductions of the discrete analog of the fundamental transformation of jonas .",
    "although the geometric integrability scheme was initially considered for real projective spaces , it is valid to projective spaces over other fields . in particular",
    ", finite field version together with the algebro - geometric method of construction of solutions to the corresponding discrete equations has been given in @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the present paper is that the geometric integrability scheme remains valid in projective spaces over division rings ( called also skew fields , for details see @xcite ) , whose simplest example are quaternions .",
    "we would like to mention that division rings appear naturally in a generalization of the notion of determinant to matrices with noncommutative entries @xcite .",
    "the so called quasideterminants have been effective in many areas including noncommutative symmetric functions , noncommutative integrable systems , quantum algebras and yangians , noncommutative algebraic geometry .",
    "last but not least , the division ring of formal pseudodifferential operators lies in the heart of the sato approach @xcite to integrable systems , see also @xcite .",
    "we should warn the reader that a ring of square matrices usually is not a division ring ( the sum of two invertible matrices does not have to be invertible or the zero matrix ) . also , by the wedderburn theorem , finite division rings are commutative .",
    "the subject of noncommutative versions of integrable systems was studied in the literature in many papers , see , for example @xcite and references therein ; we would like to stress that in the present paper noncommutativity is considered only on the level of dependent variables , i.e. , the independent variables are still commutative ones . in relation to our work",
    "we would like to mention the paper @xcite where the noncommutative discrete kp equation was considered , and the papers @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xcite a quantization of the discrete darboux equations was investigated .",
    "it should be also mentioned that already in the paper @xcite the discrete darboux equations , together with some of their transformations , were considered in the matrix version within the non - local @xmath16-dressing method , thus in the noncommutative setting ( for the differential matrix darboux - manakov ",
    "zakharov equations see @xcite ) .    the paper is constructed as follows . in section [ sec : ql ]",
    "we study the multidimensional quadrilateral lattices in projective spaces over division rings .",
    "in particular , we consider the corresponding discrete noncommutative darboux equations together with the corresponding linear problem , and we discuss differences and similarities with the commutative case . in section [ sec",
    ": ft ] we give the vectorial fundamental transformation for such lattices .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : bc ] we study possibility of the geometric generalization of the b - quadrilateral lattices ( and thus of the discrete bkp equations ) to the noncommutative setting . we show that the additional incidence geometry structures which imply integrability of the b - quadrilateral lattices @xcite force the division ring to be commutative .",
    "the main results of the paper were presented in my talk _ geometric algebra and quadrilateral lattices _ during the island 3 ( integrable systems : linear and nonlinear dynamics ) conference _ algebraic aspects of integrable systems _ , port ellen , isle of islay , scotland ( july , 2007 ) .      because the intended target of the paper consists of specialists from integrable systems theory we start from presenting some basic facts on the interplay between incidence geometry axioms and the corresponding algebraic structures ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "a _ projective plane _ is a set , whose elements are called _ points _ and a set of subsets , called _ lines _ , satisfying the following four axioms :    * two distinct points lie on one and exactly one line ; * two distinct lines meet in precisely one point ; * there exist four points with no three collinear .     and",
    "@xmath17 are perspective from the point @xmath18 , and are perspective from the line @xmath19.,width=264 ]    it is known that axioms p1-p3 make possible to introduce on the plane coordinates from an algebraic structure called the _",
    "ternary ring_. if , in addition to p1-p3 , _ the desargues axiom _ holds : ( see figure  [ fig : desargues ] ) :    * if two triangles are perspective from a point then they are perspective from a line ;    then axioms p1-p4 imply possibility of coordinatization of the plane in terms of a division ring .",
    "if , instead , one adds to the axioms p1-p3 the so called _ pappus axiom _ :    * if the six vertices of a hexagon lie alternately on two lines , then the three points of intersection of pairs of opposite sides are collinear ;     lie alternately on two ( coplanar ) lines @xmath20 and @xmath19 , and the three points @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 of intersection of pairs of opposite sides are collinear , width=302 ]    then one has coordinates in commutative division ring , i.e. in a field .    for more dimensional projective spaces the basic incidence axioms , analogous to p1p3 , are enough to show that the spaces are actually coordinatized by division rings , i.e. , there is no need for the desargues axiom ( which becomes a theorem ) . in order to have a projective geometry over a field one has to add the pappus axiom ( or its equivalent formulations ) .",
    "because the geometric integrability scheme is valid in projective spaces over division rings , this motivates us to consider quadrilateral lattices in such spaces .      consider a multidimensional quadrilateral lattice , i. e. , a mapping @xmath24 with all the elementary quadrilaterals planar @xcite ; here @xmath25 is @xmath26 dimensional integer lattice , and @xmath27 is @xmath28 dimensional right projective space over division ring @xmath29 ( we multiply vectors by scalars from right ) .",
    "it turns out that the theory of quadrilateral lattices in spaces over division rings does not differ considerably from the standard case where @xmath29 was assumed to be commutative .",
    "one should be only careful with the order of coefficients .    below we will use the affine description of the quadrilateral lattice . recall that the affine space @xmath30 is the projective space with removed a fixed hyperplane @xmath31 ( called the hyperplane at infinity ; see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "two lines of @xmath32 called parallel if they intersect in a point of @xmath33 .    in the affine gauge the lattice is represented by a mapping @xmath34 , the planarity condition can be formulated in terms of the laplace equations @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the translation operator in the @xmath37-th direction .",
    "then the coefficients @xmath38 satisfy , by compatibility of the system , @xmath39 the @xmath40 symmetry of rhs of implies existence of the potentials @xmath41 , @xmath42 , ( called the lam coefficients ) such that @xmath43    if we introduce the suitably scaled tangent vectors @xmath44 , @xmath45 , by equations @xmath46 ( here @xmath47 ) and the rotation coefficients @xmath48 , @xmath49 , by @xmath50 then equations can be rewritten as a first order system @xmath51 the compatibility condition for the system   ( or its adjoint  ) gives the following form of the mql ( or discrete darboux ) equations @xmath52    the above equations ( up to small modification which , in our language , results from considering left - vector spaces ) appeared first in the matrix setting in @xcite .    an important geometric fact , which lies in the heart of integrability of the quadrilateral lattice , is the multidimensional consistency of the geometric integrability scheme .",
    "its four dimensional version reads as follows ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:4dconsistency ] ) .    .",
    "the second step of the construction ( dotted lines ) gives another four hexahedra exhausting this way all the hexahedra of the hypercube.,width=302 ]    given points @xmath0",

    "construct the points @xmath57 , @xmath58  the remaining vertices of the four ( combinatorial ) cubes .",
    "then there are four different ways to construct the point @xmath59 , which is the last vertex of the ( combinatorial ) hypercube .",
    "however all of them give the same result due to the fact that the point @xmath59 is the unique intersection point of the four three dimensional subspaces @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 of the four dimensional subspace @xmath64 .",
    "the backward tangent vectors @xmath65 , the backward lam coefficients @xmath66 , @xmath67 and the backward rotation coefficients @xmath68 are defined with the help of the backward shifts @xmath69 .",
    "they are again chosen in such a way that the @xmath69 variation of @xmath70 is proportional to @xmath65 only : @xmath71 then @xmath72 and @xmath73 the new functions @xmath68 satisfy the backward darboux ( mql ) equations @xmath74    notice that , opposite to the commutative case @xcite , the backward darboux equations are not the same like the forward darboux equations  .",
    "the connection factors @xmath75 are the proportionality coefficients between @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( both vectors are proportional to @xmath78 ) : @xmath79 going around an elementary quadrilateral it is not difficult to show that @xmath80 and @xmath81    in the commutative case there exists yet another potential ( the @xmath82-function of the quadrilateral lattice ) such that @xmath83 which is an immediate consequence of @xmath84 the last equation does not hold in the noncommutative case because , in general @xmath85 .",
    "due to its vectorial character , the theory of transformations of quadrilateral lattices transfers to the noncommutative case almost without changes .",
    "therefore mostly we just state the relevant formulas ( the proofs are by direct verification along lines given in @xcite ) .",
    "given the solution @xmath86 , of the linear system , and given the solution @xmath87 , of the linear system ; we recall that elements of @xmath88 we represent by column vectors , and elements of its dual @xmath89 as row vectors .",
    "these allow to construct the linear operator valued potential @xmath90 , defined by @xmath91 similarly , one defines @xmath92 and @xmath93 by @xmath94 we remark that because we multiply vectors from the right then covectors are multiplied from the left .",
    "this makes the tensor products above well defined .",
    "[ prop : ft ] if @xmath95 is invertible then the vector function @xmath96 given by @xmath97 represent a quadrilateral lattice ( the vectorial fundamental transform of @xmath98 ) , whose lam coefficients @xmath99 , normalized tangent vectors @xmath100 and rotation coefficients @xmath101 are given by @xmath102 moreover , the backward data and the connection coefficients transform according to @xmath103    we would like to mention that the above formulas can be put into a form using the so called quasideterminants @xcite , like it was done , for example , in @xcite for a non - abelian toda lattice .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite for the commutative case , other darboux - type transformations of the quadrilateral lattice , like the laplace , combescure , lvy , adjoint lvy or the radial transformations , can be obtained as reductions of the fundamental transformation .",
    "there are no obstructions which would prevent the geometric reasoning applied in @xcite to transfer such a statement to the noncommutative case .",
    "the vectorial fundamental transformation can be considered as superposition of @xmath104 ( scalar ) fundamental transformations ; on intermediate stages the rest of the transformation data should be suitably transformed as well .",
    "such a description contains already the principle of permutability of such transformations , which follows from the following observation  @xcite .",
    "assume the following splitting of the data of the vectorial fundamental transformation @xmath105 associated with the partition @xmath106 , which implies the following splitting of the potentials @xmath107 @xmath108 then the vectorial fundamental transformation is equivalent to the following superposition of vectorial fundamental transformations : + 1 ) transformation @xmath109 with the data @xmath110 , @xmath111 and the corresponding potentials @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 @xmath115 2 ) application on the result the vectorial fundamental transformation with the transformed data @xmath116 and potentials @xmath117 i.e. , @xmath118^{-1 } { \\boldsymbol{\\omega}}(\\boldsymbol{y}^b , h)^{\\{a\\}}.\\ ] ]    the transformation rules for the intermediate data and potentials are consequence of proposition  [ prop : ft ] .",
    "denote @xmath119 and notice that @xmath120 which gives @xmath121 inserting such @xmath122 into formula we obtain @xmath123 thus equation .",
    "the same result @xmath124 is obtained exchanging the order of transformations , exchanging also the indices @xmath125 and @xmath126 in formulas - .",
    "the scalar , i.e. @xmath127 , fundamental transformation preserves in the noncommutative case its geometric meaning as a transformation between two quadrilateral lattices such that @xmath98 , @xmath128 @xmath129 , @xmath130 are coplanar .",
    "therefore also in the noncommutative case the fundamental transformation can be considered as a construction of a new level ( in the new dimension direction ) of the quadrilateral lattice . in particular , in the case @xmath131 , @xmath132 , any point @xmath98 of the lattice and its transforms @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 are coplanar .",
    "we will concentrate below on the b-(moutard ) quadrilateral lattice which provides geometric interpretation of the discrete bkp equations .",
    "we will study implications of the corresponding additional ( apart from the geometric integrability scheme ) incidence geometric structures , which assure integrability of the above mentioned reduction , on the possibility of deriving their noncommutative versions .",
    "the main result of this section is that the multidimensional consistency of the reduction holds if and only if the division ring is commutative .    in the geometric considerations below we assume generality of configurations , i.e. , only those explicitly stated ( and their consequences ) hold . in particular ,",
    "the subspace @xmath136 of the hypercube in the four dimensional consistency of the geometric integrability scheme has dimension four .",

    "the four dimensional consistence of the bql - constraint was proved algebraically in @xcite in the commutative case .",
    "we will show geometrically that , in contrary to the quadrilateral lattice case , one can not obtain directly the noncommutative integrable b - quadrilateral lattice .",
