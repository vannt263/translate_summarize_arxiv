    "given a function @xmath1 , we denote the @xmath2th iterate of @xmath3 by @xmath4 , for any positive integer @xmath2 , and we define the _ escaping set _ @xmath5 of @xmath3 to be @xmath6 the escaping set of an entire function is a familiar object in complex dynamics .",
    "such sets were first studied in generality by eremenko @xcite , who showed that if @xmath3 is a transcendental entire function , then @xmath5 is never empty and the closure of @xmath5 has no bounded components .",
    "eremenko conjectured that , in fact , @xmath5 has no bounded components ; this conjecture remains open and has stimulated much further investigation .",
    "in @xcite , escaping sets of quasiregular functions were studied ; we refer to , for example , @xcite for a definition of a quasiregular function .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath1 is a quasiregular function , then , providing @xmath3 satisfies a certain growth condition , the escaping set @xmath5 necessarily contains an unbounded component .",
    "also , an example was given of a quasiregular function with an essential singularity at infinity for which the closure of the escaping set has a bounded component .",
    "this shows that eremenko s conjecture fails for quasiregular functions .",
    "the escaping set can be defined for _ any _ function from @xmath0 to itself ",
    "the function need not be complex differentiable or quasiregular  so it is reasonable to study escaping sets in a more general context . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the structure of escaping sets of _ continuous _ functions from @xmath0 to itself ( our functions need not even be surjective ) .",
    "more explicitly , we address the following question : _ given a subset @xmath7 of @xmath0 , does there exist a continuous function @xmath1 such that @xmath8 ? _ we give examples to show that this question , in its full generality , is difficult .",
    "we make headway with some special cases , particularly in one dimension , and highlight some interesting differences between the theory of escaping sets of continuous functions and the theory of escaping sets of transcendental entire functions .",
    "we are not aware of any other study of escaping sets in this generality .",
    "to facilitate our discussion , we make the following definition .",
    "suppose that @xmath7 is a subset of @xmath0 .",
    "then we say that @xmath7 is an _",
    "@xmath9-set _ if there is a continuous function @xmath1 such that @xmath8 .",
    "notice that the collection of @xmath9-sets is invariant under homeomorphisms , in the following sense .",
    "let us denote the set @xmath10 by @xmath11 , and endow it with the usual topology of a one - point compactification .",
    "suppose that @xmath7 and @xmath12 are subsets of @xmath0 , and there is a homeomorphism @xmath13 such that @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "then @xmath7 is an @xmath9-set if and only if @xmath12 is an @xmath9-set .",
    "this follows from the fact that if @xmath8 , then @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath3 is continuous , then @xmath5 is either empty or unbounded .",
    "moreover , we can write @xmath17 it follows that a necessary condition for a non - empty set @xmath7 to be an @xmath9-set is that @xmath7 is an unbounded @xmath18 set . however , there are many examples in this paper of unbounded @xmath18 sets that are not @xmath9-sets . in order to obtain sufficient conditions for sets to be @xmath9-sets ,",
    "we must impose further restrictions on them ; first we look at open sets , and then sets in one dimension .",
    "the reader may care to peruse figure  [ fig : sets ] and speculate as to which of the six open planar sets , shown in black , are @xmath19-sets ; all will be revealed later .    in the caption of figure",
    "[ fig : sets ] , we denote the open disc with radius @xmath20 and centre @xmath21 by @xmath22 . also , for positive numbers @xmath20 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we write @xmath25 which is an open sector of the disc @xmath26 of angle @xmath27 . we remark that none of the open sets displayed in the figure are the escaping sets of transcendental entire functions , as the escaping sets of such functions are never open .",
    "this follows from the observation that if , on the contrary , @xmath3 is a transcendental entire function and @xmath5 is open , then the _ julia set _ of @xmath3 , which is equal to @xmath28 , does not meet @xmath5 , which contradicts a result of @xcite ; we refer to @xcite for further background and definitions .",
    "it is useful to observe now that , if @xmath29 , then @xmath5 is _ completely invariant _ , in the sense that @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the results in this subsection are about classifying _",
    "open _ @xmath9-sets .",
    "we follow the convention here ( and later on ) that if @xmath32 is not specified , then it can take any positive integer value .",
    "we define an _ unbounded curve _ to be a continuous injective function @xmath33 such that the image set @xmath34 is unbounded .",
    "we say that infinity is _ accessible _ from an unbounded open subset @xmath35 of @xmath0 if there is an unbounded curve @xmath36 that does not accumulate at any point of @xmath0 , in the sense that @xmath37 as @xmath38 .",
    "such a curve is a homeomorphism onto its image .",
    "[ theo : hasanunboundedcomponent ] any open , unbounded subset of @xmath0 from which infinity is accessible is an @xmath9-set .",
    "we remark that baker ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) showed that infinity is always accessible in a so - called _ baker domain _ of a transcendental entire function ; a baker domain is an open set in which the iterates tend to infinity locally uniformly , and so always lies in the escaping set .",
    "later on we will see two examples , examples  [ example : snake ] and [ example : failsnake ] , of unbounded subsets of @xmath39 from which infinity is _ not _ accessible . in the first example , the unbounded set _ is _ an @xmath19-set , and in the second , the unbounded set is _ not _ an @xmath19-set . the set in the second example ,",
    "however , has two components ; it is not a domain .",
    "the question of whether every unbounded domain in @xmath39 is an @xmath19-set remains open .",
    "next we consider open sets without unbounded components .",
    "there certainly are open sets without unbounded components that are @xmath19-sets : example  [ example.open ] ( to come ) provides an example of one .",
    "the following theorem gives necessary conditions for an open set without unbounded components to be an @xmath9-set .",
    "[ theo : hasnounboundedcomponent ] suppose that @xmath7 is a non - empty open subset of @xmath0 that has no unbounded components .",
    "if @xmath7 is an @xmath9-set , then there exist a sequence @xmath40 of components of @xmath7 and @xmath41 , such that    1 .",
    "@xmath42 as @xmath43;[t21 ] 2 .",
    "@xmath44 , for @xmath45.[t22 ]    we show later ( see example  [ example.nastyone ] ) that the conditions of theorem  [ theo : hasnounboundedcomponent ] are not sufficient for an open set with no unbounded components to be an @xmath9-set .",
    "let us now consider escaping sets in one dimension .",
    "we can immediately classify the open @xmath46-sets using theorems  [ theo : hasanunboundedcomponent ] and [ theo : hasnounboundedcomponent ] , because it is impossible for an open set in @xmath47 to satisfy the conditions of theorem  [ theo : hasnounboundedcomponent ] .",
    "[ theo : nounb ] a non - empty open subset of @xmath47 is an @xmath46-set if and only if it has an unbounded component .",
    "our next result shows that even in one dimension , escaping sets can have a complicated structure .",
    "[ theo : r1irrational ] the set of irrationals is an @xmath46-set .    it is well known ( see , for example , @xcite ) that if @xmath48 is a countable , dense subset of @xmath47 , then there is a homeomorphism @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "therefore the complement of @xmath48 in @xmath47 is an @xmath46-set .    in view of theorem  [ theo : r1irrational ] , it is natural to ask whether the set of integers , or the set of rational numbers , is an @xmath46-set .",
    "it follows from the next result that this is not the case .",
    "[ theo : r1uncountable ] suppose that @xmath7 is an @xmath46-set , and that @xmath52 .",

    "we give several examples that illustrate the differences between the one- and higher - dimensional cases . here",
    "are brief descriptions of three such examples .    1 .",
    "in contrast to theorem  [ theo : r1open ] , we give an @xmath19-set , the complement of which is a domain ( example  [ example.halfplane ] ) .",
    "2 .   in contrast",
    "to theorem  [ theo : r1uncountable ] , we give a countable nowhere dense set , which is an @xmath19-set ( example  [ example.z ] ) .",
    "3 .   in contrast to the previous example",
    ", we give a countable nowhere dense set , the complement of which is an @xmath19-set ( example  [ example.zcomp ] ) .",
    "although , for simplicity , all these examples are in two dimensions , it is clear that they can be extended to any dimension greater than one .      in section  [ sec : rmore ]",

    "we require the following lemma , which is a variation , in euclidean space , of the tietze extension theorem ; see , for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 15.8 ) . in the proof of the lemma ( and elsewhere in the paper )",
