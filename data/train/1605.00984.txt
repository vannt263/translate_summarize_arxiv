    "typically , we use @xmath16 as the initial angle , which means that the swimmer is oriented parallel to the plane .",
    "the fluid in the channel is fully quiescent at time @xmath111 and the particle starts with zero velocity .",
    "the lb parameters are chosen such that after the particle has moved only a fraction of @xmath3 the fluid flow field and terminal velocity of the swimmer is established , thereby minimizing the effect of inertia and momentum - transport retardation that physically do not play a role on the colloidal length scale at low reynolds number .",
    "to prevent the swimmers from penetrating the wall , we include a weeks - chandler - anderson ( wca ) interaction between the raspberry coupling points and the bounce - back boundaries .",

    "the notation of the quantities is the one used throughout and each quantity and value are separated by a single underscore .",
    "we chose a slightly smaller lateral extent of the channel than used to produce fig .  1 of the main text",
    "the reason is that for the typical channel sizes studied in our work , the motion of the swimmer would be difficult to observe .",
    "however , we have verified that the limited size of the channel does not strongly effect the trajectory .",
    "we scrutinize the presence of the artificial limit cycle for our pusher - type rod through a series of computational examinations . by our examinations",
    "we reach the following conclusions .",
    "since the lb algorithm does not explicitly account for near - wall lubrication corrections  @xcite , it fails to be accurate in the near wall regime and we are therefore unable to comment on the nature of any potential limit cycle . additionally , the counter - force point can artificially penetrate the wall at the point of closest approach .",
    "these points indicate that , although limit cycles may exist in certain physical swimmers , the simulated trajectories can not offer physically relevant predictions .",
    "we explain the way we arrived at these conclusions in detail below .    in our examination of the system",
    ", the lateral extent of the domain is varied between @xmath118 and @xmath119 to eliminate the effect of @xmath11 periodicity on our results : there is no discernible impact of @xmath120 on the trajectories above @xmath121 .",
    "we vary the viscosity and swimming speed to verify that retardation of the fluid momentum transport does not introduce these cycles ; these changes only have a small effect .",
    "the value of the wca interaction @xmath114 is varied , as shown explicitly in fig .",
    "[ fig : wca ] .",
    "we find that for @xmath122 the limit cycle disappears and the rod s trajectory is reminiscent of the pusher cylinder s , see fig . 1 in the main text .",
    "in both of these cases ( inflated wca rod and the unmodified cylinder ) non - hydrodynamic contact with the wca wall occurs and the self - propelled particles move along the plane of contact ( sliding ) .",

    "fortuitously , it does not penetrate the wall , although penetration can be achieved in this case by starting with values of @xmath8 that are greater than @xmath126 when @xmath127 .",
    "this may seem to indicate that the limit cycle is a physical effect .",

    "the vertical extent of the lattice nodes involved in the 3-point interpolation of the counter - force are indicated using the red and blue lines.,width=8 ]    we therefore also considered the interaction of the counter - force point with the wall , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cfp ] .",
    "we find that the counter - force interpolation ( which takes place over a region of @xmath129 in diameter due to the three - point coupling ) is partially inside of the wall at the closest approach , which impacts the reorientation of the rod .",
    "to check the effect of this , we switched to a two - point interpolation stencil .",
    "the limit cycle persists , but here too the interpolation region overlaps with the wall nodes , even though the overlap is substantially reduced .",
    "when the value of @xmath114 increases beyond @xmath130 , the counter - force point is no longer interpolated inside the wall .",
    "similarly , the cylinder s size prevents its counter - force point from being interpolated into the wall at closest approach .",
    "this indicates that the limit cycle observed for lb - raspberry swimmers is due to limitations in simulating the hydrodynamic interactions for close swimmer - wall separations , because of the spread - out counter - force scheme .",
    "while the near - wall hydrodynamics are not accurately captured by our algorithm , the far - field is .",
    "therefore , in a system where there is a long - range ( non - hydrodynamic ) repulsion , our algorithm would produce the correct physics  provided that the range of the repulsion is sufficient to keep the lb coupling points far enough away from the wall . in the main text , we chose the wca repulsion in such a way that the size of the ` hard core ' matches the effective hydrodynamic size of the particle . choosing the wca range much larger ,",
    "would remove this physical correspondence ; therefore using an additional soft potential would be more appropriate to achieve wall repulsion .",
    "we are , however , unaware of any biological or artificial swimmers that are strongly repulsed from boundaries by long - ranged potentials and have therefore not considered this possibility further here .    in summary ,",
    "the persistent oscillation ( limit cycle ) seen after long times for pusher - type swimmers must be attributed to a simulation artifact . nevertheless , for the onset of the oscillation , which we are interested in the main text , there are no counter - force - overlap problems , as is clearly illustrated in fig .",

    "[ fig : length ] . since the effective hydrodynamic diameter of the rods",
    "is governed primarily by the coupling parameters when using only a single row of coupling points  @xcite , varying the length has the effect of varying the aspect ratio of rod - shaped particles .",
    "we found only minor modifications of the trajectories , reflecting the minor changes in the hydrodynamic multipole expansion due to the change in aspect ratio .",

    "<S> we explain these observations within the framework of our far - field hydrodynamic theory : the dipole and octupole moments induce hydrodynamic forces towards the center ( puller ) or towards the walls ( pusher ) , while the quadrupole moment causes pure oscillatory motion . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillatory trajectories within plate confinement thus provides an indirect means to characterize the hydrodynamic properties of swimmers , which would grant access to moments beyond those that can be obtained from lattice swimming  @xcite or tracer paths  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> to prevent the swimmers from penetrating the wall , we imposed a short - ranged ( almost hard ) weeks - chandler - anderson ( wca ) interaction between the raspberry swimmers and the walls ( appendix  [ sub : setup ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this wall - swimmer interaction is necessary as our lb algorithm does not explicitly account for near - wall lubrication corrections  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all of the results shown in the main text employ a wca diameter @xmath17 , with @xmath3 the lb lattice size . </S>",
    "<S> we limit the swimming speed to ensure the low reynolds number regime , @xmath18 .    figure  [ fgr : traj ] and the supplemental movies ( not included in arxiv version ) demonstrate the onset of oscillatory trajectories . </S>",

    "<S> oscillations are observed for all cylinder and rod swimmers in plate separations that we could simulate ( @xmath20 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rod is @xmath21 in length , thus the oscillatory trajectories arise in systems with a channel height to particle size ratio up to at least 10 .    to verify the generality of the initial oscillations </S>",
    "<S> , we considered several initial positions @xmath1 and orientations @xmath8 for rod pusher and puller swimmers . </S>",
    "<S> we found that depending on the type of swimmer and its initial position / orientation , several oscillations in the physical regime can be observed , before near - wall effects can not be ignored . </S>",
    "<S> we further showed that oscillations for rod - like swimmers appear for a large range in rod aspect ratios ( appendix  [ sub : length ] ) . at long times </S>",

    "<S> appendix  [ sub : limit ] provides a discussion of these limitations and this work does not confirm their physical nature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , our results establish that the initial oscillations before the rod comes close to the wall ( a proximity of @xmath22 ) are physical . </S>",
    "<S> it is this onset of oscillatory trajectories that we concern ourselves with here and subject to theoretical analysis in the following .    </S>",
    "<S> we model the raspberry swimmers theoretically as ellipsoids with aspect ratio @xmath23 , position @xmath24 and orientation @xmath25 . due to its motion </S>",
    "<S> , the swimmer generates a flow field @xmath26 , which we define in terms of a multipole expansion of the stokeslet flow solution . </S>",
    "<S> spagnolie  _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ argue that far - field his give surprisingly accurate results , when compared to theory that includes a finite - size correction to more accurately account for near - field effects , even for small swimmer - wall separations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the flow at position @xmath27 generated by the force - free and torque - free swimmer is @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the stokes dipole that models the force balance between propulsion and drag , @xmath30 is the quadrupole that represents the fore - aft asymmetry of the propulsion mechanism , @xmath31 is the quadrupolar source doublet that is associated with the finite size of the swimmer , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the two octupolar terms ( appendix  [ sub : model ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of these moments in bulk is shown in table  [ table : multipolemoments ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that this is a point - based expansion , which should not be confused with the squirmer expansion for finite - sized spheres ; in the far - field these expansions can be mapped onto each other .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the confining walls ( two parallel no - slip plates ) is now accounted for by the method of images , where we truncate the approximation after four image systems on each side of the microchannel . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , the flow wall - induced flow advects and reorients the swimmer according to the faxn relations , resulting in the translational and angular velocities @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( appendix  [ sub : images ] ) . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite details are given of the procedure by which to obtain these velocities in terms of the multipole coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the swimmer s equations of motion are given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the autonomous swimming speed , and the velocities @xmath34 and @xmath35 are functions of the multipole coefficients .     </S>",

    "<S> [ fgr : traj ] theoretically , we integrate the equations of motion  . here </S>",
    "<S> , we use the same swimming speed and initial conditions as in the lb simulations , but we allow the multipole coefficients to vary about their measured values </S>",
    "<S> . we can thus fit the multipole coefficients via a least - squares method . to obtain the best agreement with the measured trajectory </S>",
    "<S> , we used the four initial oscillations ( appendix  [ sub : fitting ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the 3^rd^ and 5^th^ columns of table  [ table : multipolemoments ] show the multipole coefficients found in this manner for swimmers of the rod and cylinder type , respectively . using only a single oscillation leads to a change in the fitted values of @xmath60 , showing our method to be robust and requiring only fragments of a trajectory to be effective . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we verified that the result of the fitting was independent of the height @xmath10 of the channel , eliminating the possibility of boundary artifacts . in our previous work  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we obtained the multipole coefficients directly from the flow field of the swimmers in our lb simulations by means of projection via a legendre - fourier decomposition . </S>",
    "<S> these values are listed in the 2^nd^ and 4^th^ columns of table  [ table : multipolemoments ] , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the projection was carried out in the absence of confinement , using a large simulation box with periodic boundary conditions , for which the finite - size effects differ strongly from those of the confining geometry . </S>",
    "<S> there is excellent correspondence between the two measurements of the hydrodynamic moments for both swimmer shapes . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the applicability of far - field theory to describe the onset of the observed oscillatory trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> the far - field result is accurate until the swimmer - wall distance becomes too small .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now focus on the general features of the theoretical model and analyze the impact of the various hydrodynamic moments on the motion of the swimmer . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , our calculations confirm that the pusher swimmer ( @xmath61 ) undergoes oscillatory trajectories that move away from the center of the channel , and pullers ( @xmath62 ) converge towards the centerline . </S>",
    "<S> however , oscillations about the center only occur if the quadrupolar terms are included , and the oscillation wavelength decreases with the associated quadrupolar coefficients @xmath44 and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> a spherical swimmer with @xmath63  @xcite does not display such oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the octupolar contributions further control the damping and growth of the trajectories , where the positive signs of @xmath51 and @xmath52 correspond to motion towards the boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> the aspect ratio @xmath23 leads only to a second - order correction in the theory . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the hydrodynamic moments dominate the dynamics of the swimmer , therefore rods with different aspect ratios still show similar oscillations ( appendix  [ sub : length ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath1 ) phase space , for a rod - type pusher ( a ) and puller ( b ) with a wall separation of @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the lb simulation data are shown as thick , dashed , blue and red lines . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical predictions are superimposed as black arrows . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical system can be understood further by considering the motion of the swimmer in phase space . </S>",
    "<S> due to the translational invariance in the @xmath0 and @xmath65 coordinates , the equations of motion can be reduced to two coupled first - order pdes in ( @xmath8,@xmath1 ) space , next to the uncoupled equation for the @xmath0 coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fgr : phasespace ] shows the lb swimmer trajectories in phase space , superimposed with the theoretical model , where the fitted multipole moments in table  [ table : multipolemoments ] have been used . </S>",
    "<S> the dipolar term leads to a star - type fixed point ( curves radiating from a point ) at the origin , that is stable for pullers and unstable for pushers . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillatory motion due to the quadrupolar contributions corresponds to a circle - type phase - space trajectory ( closed loops around a point ) centered on the origin . together </S>",
    "<S> the dipole and quadrupole produce a spiral . for pushers , </S>",
    "<S> the trajectories spiral outwards ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fgr : phasespace]a ) , and inwards for pullers ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fgr : phasespace]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical predictions do not show a limit cycle in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fgr : phasespace ] . both the far - field framework and the lb method are unable to adequately capture hydrodynamic interactions in the near - wall region and further study of this region , where both lubrication corrections  @xcite and short - ranged potentials  @xcite can play a role , is required .    </S>",
    "<S> our result shows that movement of a swimmer under confinement can in principle be used to quantitatively determine the hydrodynamic moments , even up to the octupolar moment as shown here . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , about one period is the minimum path length required to fit these modes to within 20% . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that our method has applicability to experimental systems where thermal noise and tumbling can effect the trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of these sources of noise would require ensemble averaging trajectories in @xmath66 space , which can then be fitted using our procedure . </S>",
    "<S> noise also implies that parts of the trajectory will occur many times during measurements , meaning the near - wall dynamics in which we observed a limit cycle , does not play an important role . </S>",
    "<S> one simply averages many different trajectories away from the wall to improve the fitting statistics .        </S>",
    "<S> a physical intuition for the onset of oscillatory swimming can be distilled from the lb simulations and far - field hydrodynamic description by considering the trajectory of a swimmer initially set at @xmath67 near the centerline and oriented parallel to the walls ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fgr : cartoon ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> since our raspberry swimmers have large quadrupolar moments ( @xmath68 ) , we first consider only the flow fields generated by the positive quadrupole . </S>",
    "<S> this flow serves to rotate the swimmer away from the nearest wall , as shown schematically in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fgr : cartoon]a . </S>",
    "<S> the continual rotation away from the nearest wall establishes the oscillations . by linearly expanding the equations of motion about the centerline </S>",
    "<S> , the micro - swimmer dynamics can be captured by a linear system of coupled differential equations ( appendix  [ sub : oscillations ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> whenever there is only a quadrupolar flow field , the trajectory is approximated to be simple oscillatory motion @xmath69 with angular frequency @xmath70 and wavelength @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath72 in this study , a source dipole moment also leads to simple oscillations ( appendix  [ sub : oscillations ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this also theoretically explains the observations of persistent oscillations for neutral squirmers made by zhu  _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , even though there are differences in the confining geometry . </S>",
    "<S> next we add the dipolar term to the expansion @xmath73 where @xmath74 , which is negative for pullers . </S>",
    "<S> the dipolar term also modifies the frequency @xmath75 due the wall - induced rotation @xmath35 , but this effect is negligible if @xmath76 , which is the case here . </S>",
    "<S> a pusher also obeys equation but with @xmath77 and exponentially growing amplitudes , which leads to a rapid breakdown of the near - centerline assumption . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of oscillations to channel height is unmistakable in the @xmath78-dependence of reflecting the fact that the essential hydrodynamic moments are high order . </S>",
    "<S> whereas higher order moments are required to predict the oscillation wavelength and damping factor quantitatively , the dipolar and quadrupolar moments can be fit from the dynamics using with a error margin of @xmath79 compared to the lb - measured values . </S>",
    "<S> hence , - allow for characterization of the swimmer s hydrodynamic properties based on experimental trajectories and can be readily transferred to the observations made by zhu  _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , lb raspberry simulations can be extended to more complex 3d geometries such as square channels and round tubes , in which we observed helical motion ( appendix  [ sub : helical ] ) .    in conclusion , we have studied the onset of oscillatory motion of swimmers in microchannels without externally applied flow and in an otherwise quiescent medium using both lb simulations and hydrodynamic theory . </S>",
    "<S> the pusher - type swimmers follow a sinusoidal trajectory with increasing amplitude , whereas pullers perform a damped oscillation towards the center of the channel . </S>",
    "<S> our results and previous observations of such phenomena  @xcite can be explained by our theoretical model , which uses far - field hydrodynamics only . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the onset of oscillations can be described without taking into account near - wall lubrication effects as has been previously presumed  @xcite provided that a quadrupole moment ( or source - dipole ) is accounted for in addition to the primary dipole moment . to fully characterize particle trajectories in relatively wide channels , </S>",
    "<S> many hydrodynamic moments are required , as high as the octupole in our case . </S>",
    "<S> however , the excellent match of our trajectory - fitted moments to those measured in bulk suggests that similar experimental measurements can be used to determine the hydrodynamic moment decomposition of microorganisms or artificial swimmers . </S>",
    "<S> our work stresses the relevance of far - field hydrodynamics in confining geometries and thus opens the way for new studies that aim to exploit these insights in microfluidic environments . </S>",
    "<S> future work will focus on the analysis of more complex force / counter - force swimmers to model the richness in shape and hydrodynamic moments of experimentally available swimmers .    </S>",
