    "interstellar scintillation ( iss ) of compact radio sources probes structure in the ionized instellar medium of our galaxy down to extremely small scales ( @xmath2 km ) .",
    "pks  1257@xmath3326 ( galactic coordinates @xmath4 ) is a flat spectrum , radio - loud quasar at @xmath5 which exhibits intrahour flux density variability at frequencies of several ghz due to iss @xcite .",
    "it was the third confirmed `` intrahour variable '' ( ihv ) quasar , after pks  0405@xmath3385 @xcite and j1819 + 3845 @xcite .",
    "the recent large - scale _ microarcsecond scintillation - induced variability _ ( masiv ) vla survey at 5  ghz showed that while a large fraction of flat - spectrum radio sources exhibit variations of typically a few percent on timescales of order a day , the ihv phenonemon is extremely rare ( * ? ? ? * and these proceedings ) .",
    "only a handful of quasars are known to show large variations on timescales of a few hours or less .",
    "while a source must be compact in order to scintillate , short scintillation time - scales have been attributed to nearby scattering screens within a few tens of parsec from the sun @xcite .",
    "we began monitoring pks  1257@xmath3326 with the atca at 4.8 and 8.6  ghz in 2000 following the discovery of rapid variability @xcite .",
    "we found an annual cycle in the timescale of variability which is evidently consistent over several years of observations at both frequencies .",
    "the annual cycle results from the change in scintillation velocity due to the earth s orbital motion . furthermore , simultaneous observations of pks  1257@xmath3326 with the vla and atca revealed large delays of up to 8 minutes between the variability pattern arrival times at each telescope @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig - delay ] .",
    "the two - station time delays were measured in three separate epochs , simultaneously at two frequencies and on two consecutive days in each epoch . unlike for the case of j1819 + 3845 observed with the vla and wsrt @xcite , where the projected baseline rotated through a large angle during the simultaneous observation and the time delay changed sign , for pks  1257@xmath3326 observed with the vla and atca we detect no significant change in delay over the course of an observation .",
    "the mean pattern arrival time delays for each epoch were @xmath6  s in 2002 may , @xmath7  s in 2003 january , and @xmath8  s in 2003 march .",
    "the observed annual cycle and time delays not only demonstrate conclusively that the rapid , large - amplitude variability of pks  1257@xmath3326 is entirely due to iss , but moreover these results can be used quantitavely to determine the bulk velocity of the scattering plasma as well as the characteristic length scale of the scintillation pattern in two dimensions .    in our analysis ,",
    "the scintillation pattern is assumed to be elliptical with minor axis characteristic scale length @xmath9 , and major axis @xmath10 oriented along the vector @xmath11 .",
    "the scintillation velocity is written in the form @xmath12 , and varies on an annual cycle as a function of time , @xmath13 @xcite . here",
    "we define @xmath14 as the velocity of the earth with respect to the solar system barycenter . in this notation ,",
    "the time delay expected between two telescopes displaced by a distance @xmath15 is @xcite @xmath16 where the dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath13 is suppressed .",
    "the scintillation timescale is @xmath18 we define @xmath19 as the point where the intensity autocorrelation function decays to @xmath20 of its maximum value .    in practice neither the annual cycle nor the time delay experiment datasets suffice to uniquely determine all five scintillation parameters , @xmath21 and @xmath9 , at any one observing frequency , so we fit to both the time delay and the annual cycle data simultaneously .",
    "we also fit both frequencies simultaneously , imposing the additional constraint that the scintillation velocity is identical at the two frequencies ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 at the two frequencies are still assumed independent .      when the scintillation pattern is highly anisotropic , there are degenerate solutions for the axial ratio @xmath22 and the component of velocity parallel to the major axis",
    ". however the characteristic length scale along the minor axis , @xmath9 , can still be uniquely determined .",
    "in weak scattering , as observed for pks  1257@xmath3326 at frequencies of @xmath24  ghz and above , the minor axis length scale is related to the fresnel scale , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the observing frequency and @xmath27 is the scattering screen distance .",
    "thus @xmath9 can be used to constrain @xmath27 .",
    "for pks  1257@xmath3326 we find that a highly anisotropic scintillation pattern is required to fit the data .",
    "the position angle of anisotropy is well constrained to within a few degrees but there is a degeneracy between the two components of the scattering screen velocity , and the pattern axial ratio @xmath22 is poorly constrained .",
    "figure  [ fig - fit ] shows the timescale data and annual cycles from several models imposing different constraints on the parameters . for the fits shown , we weighted @xmath28 to give the ( comparatively few ) time delay measurements equal importance in the fit relative to the characteristic timescale measurements . the dotted line in figure  [ fig - fit ]",
    "show that assuming an isotropic scintillation pattern results in a very poor fit to the data .    based on the similarity of the patterns observed at the two telescopes",
    ", we can determine a lower limit for @xmath22 .",
    "when the scintillation velocity has a significant component perpendicular to the baseline @xmath29 , as is the case for the may time delay data , we can expect a small amount of spatial decorrelation of the scintillation pattern over the atca - vla projected baseline . as detailed in @xcite after careful processing of the data we can constrain the axial ratio @xmath22 to be at least @xmath30 based on the degree of correlation between the patterns seen at each telescope .",
    "figure  [ fig - ellipse ] shows the annual cycle in scintillation velocity for a scattering screen moving at @xmath31kms@xmath32 in ra and @xmath33kms@xmath32 in dec with respect to the sun .",
    "the position angle of anisotropy in the scintillation pattern ( @xmath34 north through east ) is also illustrated by the filled ellipse in figure  [ fig - ellipse ] .    as discussed by ( * ? ? ? * and these proceedings ) , there are several lines of evidence for anisotropic turbulence in the ism . moreover the intensity autocorrelation functions for pks  1257@xmath3326 display strong oscillatory behaviour which is a signature of anisotropic scattering @xcite .",
    "therefore it seems likely that the large anisotropy in the scintillation pattern results from anisotropic scattering rather than anisotropic source structure .",
    "highly anisotropic scattering suggests a plasma controlled by a magnetic field and localized in a relatively thin `` screen '' .",
    "our best fit models give @xmath35  km at 5  ghz , and @xmath36  km at 8.6  ghz . for anisotropic scattering",
    ", our analysis shows that our definition of @xmath9 corresponds to @xmath37 for a point source in weak scattering .",
    "if the source angular size is larger than the angular fresnel scale then @xmath9 will be larger than @xmath38 .",
    "thus our data put an upper limit on the screen distance of @xmath39  pc .",
    "although there is evidence for the scattering medium being largely responsible for the high degree of anisotropy in the scintillation pattern of pks  1257@xmath3326 , it is possible that source structure also plays a role in the observed scintillation .",
    "if the scintillating component is circularly symmetric , then assuming a screen distance of @xmath40pc , approximately 100mjy would have to be contained within an angular size of @xmath41as in order to display the observed large modulations .",
    "this implies a brightness temperature of at least @xmath42  k , requiring a doppler factor of 1020 to reduce the intrinsic brightness temperature below the inverse compton limit . alternatively ,",
    "if the `` core '' happened to be elongated , or consist of several components aligned in the same direction as the ism anisotropy , then this would reduce the brightness temperature requirements .",
    "while an alignment of source structure with ism anisotropy seems an unlikely coincidence , it is conceivable that this could be another `` selection effect '' for ihv .",
    "both vla @xcite and vlba ( * ? ? ?",
    "* in press ) images of the source show broad `` jet '' components extended to the northwest of the core .",
    "speculatively , if the unresolved vlbi core consists of several components on sub - mas scales also aligned in this direction , then this implies an approximate alignment of the jet with the major axis of anisotropy in the scintillation pattern . in this case , since there is effectively only significant scattering in the direction perpendicular to the jet , the scattering screen would not `` resolve '' structure along the jet axis .",
    "simultaneous observations with the vla and atca , combined with atca monitoring over several years , have revealed some properties of the scattering plasma responsible for the rapid , intrahour - timescale scintillation of pks 1257326 .",
    "the scattering occurs in an unusually nearby ( @xmath43pc ) , localized `` screen '' . based on the longevity of the scintillation",
    "we can derive a lower limit of @xmath44  cm on the linear extent of the screen .",
    "intrahour variability is extremely rare , suggesting that these nearby screens cover a tiny fraction of the sky .",
    "the turbulence is highly anisotropic , producing a scintillation pattern with axial ratio more than @xmath1 , elongated in a northwest direction on the sky .",
    "it was suggested by j.  linksy ( private communication , this conference ) that the scattering could possibly be produced in turbulent regions of interaction at the edges of local clouds .",
    "it will be important to investigate the possible ism structures responsible for the rapid scintillation of some quasars , not only to better understand the tiny - scale structure in the ionized ism , but also to gauge the effects of iss on observations with future sensitive cm - wavelength telescopes .",
    "the atca is part of the australia telescope , which is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
