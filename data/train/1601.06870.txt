    "compared to the high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) from noble gases , hhg from plasma surfaces@xcite does not subject to the limitation of maximum applied laser intensity and can thus use the state - of - the - art terawatt and petawatt laser technology .",

    "although xuv optics in general can be used to convert xuv polarization@xcite ; its bandwidth is typically narrow and transmission efficiency is not high .",

    "some recent breakthroughs@xcite has been made in hhg from noble gases .",
    "an attosecond xuv source by hhg from plasma surfaces has the potential to further improve attosecond burst energy .",
    "it is timely for us to investigate the polarization of harmonics generated from plasma surfaces and to expore how to efficiently generate a circularly polarized attosecond light burst in the xuv region .",
    "polarization of the harmonics is one of the basic properties regularily investigated in hhg from plasma surfaces .",
    "many authors have considered the dependence of the harmonic intensity and polarization state on the incident laser pulse@xcite .",
    "three mechanisms of harmonic generation , namely relativistic oscillating mirror ( rom)@xcite , coherent wake emission ( cwe)@xcite , and coherent synchrotron emission ( cse)@xcite , have been identified .",
    "with rom , the high - order harmonics are purely doppler upshifted reflections from the oscillating plasma surface and their polarization more or less follows that of the incident laser .",
    "with cwe , because of linear mode conversion , only the @xmath7polarized component of the laser field is effective , so that the resulting harmonics are also @xmath7polarized and their intensity is proportional to the cosine of the polarization angle@xcite .",
    "there exists still not much investigation on the polarization of the harmonics from the cse mechanism .",
    "yeung et al.@xcite experimentally investigated the polarization dependence of relativistic laser - driven high - harmonic emission from thin foils in the cse context for the normal incidence in transmission geometry .",
    "the resulting polarization of the harmonics was found to be similar to that of the rom harmonics .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the polarization of cse harmonics for the oblique incidence in reflection geometry .",
    "the dependence of the polarization state of the attosecond light bursts on that of the driver laser pulses is investigated for the first time to the best of our knowledge .",
    "based on this study , we propose a new way to generate attosecond burst with circular polarization or at least with elliptical polariation and a high degree of ellipticity .",
