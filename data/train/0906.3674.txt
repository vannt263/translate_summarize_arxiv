    "in particular , the investigation of photoelectron emission from surfaces due to incidence of short laser pulses gives the chance to understand  a piece of the complicated puzzle corresponding to electron dynamics at metal surfaces .    in this article",
    "we investigate the photoelectron emission produced when an ultrashort laser pulse impinges grazingly on a metal surface , focusing the attention on the role played by the surface induced potential .",
    "the induced potential is caused by the rearrangement of valence - band electrons due to the presence of the external electromagnetic field .",
    "this potential is expected not to affect appreciably electron emission for high frequencies of the laser pulse , for which surface electrons are not able to follow the fast fluctuations of the field .",
    "but for frequencies of the pulse close or lower than the surface plasmon frequency , the induced potential becomes comparable to the laser perturbation and its effect can not be neglected . with this goal",
    "we introduce a simple model , named _ surface jellium - volkov _ ( sjv ) approximation , which includes information about the action of the surface induced potential , taking into account the main features of the process .",
    "the sjv approach is a time - dependent distorted wave method that makes use of the well - known volkov phase @xcite to describe the interaction of the active electron with the laser and the induced fields , while the surface potential is represented within the jellium model .",
    "this kind of one - active electron theories has been recently applied to study different laser - induced electron emission processes from metal surfaces , providing reasonable predictions @xcite . to corroborate the validity of the proposed approximation",
    ", we compare sjv results with the numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) , in which the contribution of the surface induced potential is also included .",
    "the induced potential is here obtained from a linear response theory by considering a jellium model for a one - dimensional slab .    with both methods - sjv and tdse",
    "- we calculate the probability of electron emission from the valence band of an al surface , considering different frequencies and durations of the laser pulse .",

    "we observe that for @xmath106 the induced potential tends to follow the oscillations of the external field and its intensity steeply diminished when the pulse is turned off .",
