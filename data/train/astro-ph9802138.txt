    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are short  period binary systems in which a roche  lobe filling low  mass main  sequence secondary transfers mass to a white dwarf ( wd ) primary .",

    "the accretion rate is essentially the same as the transfer rate . with the above typical values the h ignition on the wd turns out",
    "to be degenerate enough to cause more or less violent outbursts ( e.g.  prialnik & kovetz 1995 ) . as the mass to be accumulated before ignition is very small ( @xmath11 ) the outbursts recur on a time @xmath12 much shorter than the mass transfer timescale which determines the long  term evolution .",

    "the temperature of the wd change only slowly during the binary evolution , thus the dominant dependence of @xmath0 is from the ( mean ) mass transfer rate .",

    "but although the expansion velocity at the location of the secondary is indeed smaller than @xmath254 in the models by prialnik & kovetz @xcite they currently appear to be too large to cause a faml effect with significance for the long  term evolution of cvs ( cf .",

    "perhaps the most interesting feature of the sequences presented in this paragraph is the large outburst amplitude of the mass transfer rate in low ",
    "mass wd ( @xmath264 ) systems below the period gap .",
    "the reason for this lies mainly in the fact that @xmath14 and @xmath131 to a first approximation scale like @xmath265 ( fujimoto 1982 , @xmath266 is the wd radius ) , i.e.  increase with decreasing wd mass ( and to a lesser extent , increase with decreasing @xmath8 ) .",
    "moreover the slow but continuous decrease of the wd mass leads to a further increase of the outburst amplitudes towards shorter orbital period in this sequence ( fig .  [",

    "[ fig : satz1 ] ) which were caused by the change of @xmath207 due to decreasing @xmath41 , and to a lesser extent to the slowly increasing orbital velocity @xmath181 , mimicing increasing faml strength .",
    "such amplitudes account for a non ",
    "negligible time interval with a secular mean mass transfer rate significantly _ below _ the continuous wind average transfer rate , i.e.  below @xmath267/yr , the typical value for non  degenerate cvs below the period gap driven by gravitational radiation alone . as an example fig .",

    "intrinsically , these cvs with low - mass and moderate  mass wds form the vast majority ( e.g.  de kool 1992 , politano 1996 ) .",

    "@xcite claim to find observationally in so  called tremendous outburst amplitude dwarf novae ( toads ) which howell et al .",
    "@xcite interpret as post minimum period systems .",
    "as the secular mean mass transfer rate is predicted to drop substantially ( @xmath271/yr ) cvs which have evolved past the minimum period would be even fainter than the above post  outburst cvs , and it is unclear if they are detectable at all .",
    "we note that at least 4 objects in the list of sproats et al .",
    "@xcite have been labelled as novae ( cf .",
    "duerbeck 1987 ) : al com ( orbital period @xmath272  d , outburst suspected 1961 ) , vy aqr ( @xmath273  d , 1907 ) , rz leo ( @xmath274  d , 1918 ) and ss lmi ( no period known ; 1980 ) . with exception of ss lmi",
    "they are now firmly considered to be dwarf novae .",
    "this does not exclude a priori that the first recorded outburst ( e.g.  in 1907 for vy aqr ) or even earlier ones were actually novae .",
    "hence it is at least conceivable that the present low mass transfer rate and the toad characteristics might be a consequence of this last nova event .",
    "the three systems with known orbital period are located at the extreme end of fig .  4 of sproats et al .",
    "@xcite , showing large outburst amplitude and low quiescence magnitude . moreover , among the open square symbols indicating dne in their fig .  3 they are also those with lowest period _ and _ absolute magnitude in quiescence ( mass transfer rate @xmath275/yr ) .",
    "the fact that the claimed deviation from the secular mean magnitude is shrinking with the time elapsed since the potential nova outburst ( 1961 - 1918 - 1907 ) is probably just a coincidence .",
    "we caution that it is difficult to decide if the set of models by prialnik & kovetz @xcite properly describes classical nova outbursts on wds in cvs below the period gap .",
    "observationally , only 4 out of 28 classical novae with determined orbital period are below the gap ( e.g.  ritter & kolb 1995 ) .",
    "this is in conflict with standard population models of cvs if the prialnik & kovetz @xcite ignition masses are used to predict an observable period distribution for novae ( kolb 1995 ) .",
    "in this paper we considered the effects of nova outbursts on the secular evolution of cvs . as a result of these outbursts",
    "the secular mean mass transfer rate and the orbital period are not continuous functions of time but change essentially discontinuously with every nova outburst by an amount proportional to the ejected envelope mass .",
    "in addition , energy and angular momentum can be removed from the orbit due to dynamical friction of the secondary orbiting in the expanding nova envelope .",
    "the discontinuous evolution with a given strength of frictional angular momentum loss ( faml ) is usually replaced by the corresponding continuous wind average evolution , where the mass and angular momentum loss associated with a nova outburst is assumed to be distributed over the inter ",
    "outburst time and to form an isotropic wind from the white dwarf .",
    "we showed analytically that the well  known mass transfer stability criterion for the latter case can also be derived from a proper analysis of the real , discontinuous process , for an arbitrary strength of faml  amplification .",
    "we specified a quantitative model for faml within the framework of bondi  hoyle accretion following livio et al .  @xcite . in this model",
    "the strength of faml depends crucially on the expansion velocity @xmath0 of the envelope at the location of the secondary , being the stronger the smaller @xmath0 is .",
    "we expect that the resulting simple one  parameter description properly describes the order of magnitude of the faml effect and , more importantly , the differential dependences on fundamental binary parameters .",
    "hence although it is a useful way to study the potential influence of faml systematically , it certainly can not replace a detailed modelling of the frictional processes .",
    "calculations of the long  term evolution of cvs verified the validity of the replacement of the discontinuous sequence of nova cycles with the continuous wind average , even for situations close to mass transfer instability , whatever the strength of faml .",
    "the mass transfer rate in the continuous wind average evolution is faml  amplified , i.e.  by the factor ( [ eq : mdotratio ] ) larger than the transfer rate driven by systemic angular momentum losses alone . for a given cv this factor",
    "is determined by @xmath201 alone , i.e.  independent of the ejection mass .",
    "we emphasize that faml only _ amplifies _ the transfer rate caused by systemic losses , it does not _ add _ to them .",
    "hence faml is a particular example of consequential angular momentum losses ( caml ) investigated in detail by king & kolb @xcite .    in general",
    ", the faml amplification factor turns out to be large only when the envelope expansion is very slow ( @xmath276 , i.e.  @xmath277  km / s ) _ and _ when the system is already close to thermal mass transfer instability ( fig.[fig : factor_fix ] ) .",
    "this latter condition means that e.g.  for an evolution with strong faml @xmath278  const .",
    "the averaged mass transfer rate is significantly affected only at long orbital period , @xmath279  h.    the magnitude and direction of the outburst amplitudes of the mass transfer rate @xmath8 and the orbital period @xmath206 depend on both the ejection mass @xmath14 and the faml parameter @xmath201 . for weak ( or negligible ) faml the outbursts are towards lower mass transfer rate and longer orbital period , for strong faml towards larger @xmath8 and shorter @xmath206 .",
    "there is an intermediate regime where the outburst amplitudes essentially disappear .",
    "theoretical models for nova outbursts generally find larger expansion velocities ( e.g.  prialnik 1986 , prialnik & kovetz 1995 ) , typically @xmath280 .",
    "this is certainly true for the terminal velocities , but in more recent models probably also for the crucial velocity at the secondary s location , i.e.  closer to the wd .",
    "kato & hachisu @xcite argue that in the wind mass loss phase of a nova outburst the main acceleration ( at about the sonic point ) takes place at a temperature where the opacity has a maximum .",
    "thus the introduction of the opal opacities had the effect of moving this point closer to the wd .",
    "a comparison of the radial velocity profiles found by kato & hachisu @xcite with those obtained previously ( e.g.  prialnik 1986 , kato 1983 ) confirms this . as a result , in the newer models",
    "the velocities at the location of the secondary are already quite close to their terminal values .",
    "this explains why kato & hachisu @xcite find only marginal effects from dynamical friction .",
    "this seems to suggest that the overall influence of faml on the long  term evolution of cvs is small .",
    "however , in view of the considerable simplifications of our faml description and the uncertainties of theoretical tnr models for nova outbursts , it is worthwhile to investigate sytematically mass transfer stability with faml , and to consider the role of a feedback between outburst characteristics ( hence faml strength ) and the mean mass transfer rate prior to the outburst .",
    "we will study this in a forthcoming paper ( kolb et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "to illustrate further the effect faml might have on the secular evolution of cvs we have calculated evolutionary sequences with envelope expansion velocities , ignition and ejection masses taken from the extended set of nova models by prialnik & kovetz @xcite . as expected , the continuous wind average evolution hardly differs from the standard cv evolution without faml . as a consequence of the large ejection mass ( several @xmath281/yr ) the outburst amplitudes",
    "become very large ( a factor @xmath282 ) below the period gap for intermediate mass wds ( @xmath283 )  even more so as the outburst ",
    "induced decrease of the mass transfer is largest if faml vanishes .",
    "such systems have a mass transfer rate less than @xmath2/yr for @xmath3  myr after the outburst , and could account for intrinsically faint cvs below the period gap .",
    "we speculated ( sect .",
    "4.5 ) if toads ( e.g.  sproats et al .  1996",
    ") could represent such systems .",
    "we finally note that the apparent scatter in observationally derived values for the mass transfer rate of cvs with comparable orbital period , well  known since the review of patterson @xcite , is unlikely to be due to outburst amplitudes .",
