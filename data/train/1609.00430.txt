    "the spectroscopic perspective on a molecule is one of interacting degrees of freedom .",
    "the usual description of rovibrational motion in polyatomic molecules , in particular , consists of approximately separable anharmonic normal mode vibrations of a semi - rigid rotor .",
    "this physical picture forms the basis of the well known watson hamiltonian  @xcite , for which there are now numerous approaches for obtaining its rovibrational energies and wavefunctions .",
    "variational methods can provide numerically exact results , but their computational expense grows exponentially with atom number , limiting converged calculations to small molecules . on the other hand , approximate methods can be significantly more efficient , while retaining sufficient accuracy for spectroscopists .",
    "one of the most successful such approximate methods is second - order vibrational perturbation theory ( vpt2 )  @xcite .",
    "the zeroth order hamiltonian in vpt2 is that of a set of uncoupled harmonic oscillator vibrations and rigid top rotations .",
    "perturbative corrections from higher order anharmonic and rovibrational terms yield anharmonic vibrational frequencies and effective rotational parameters .",
    "vpt2 is commonly used to calculate accurate _ ab initio _ predictions of these molecular constants , which facilitate assigning and analyzing the optical and microwave spectra of polyatomic molecules . however , while the watson hamiltonian on which vpt2 is based is formally exact , its explicit use of rectilinear normal coordinates and single - reference eckart embedding  @xcite renders it best suited for molecules that have a well - defined equilibrium geometry from which they undergo small amplitude displacements .",
    "this leads to the observed difficulty of vpt2 with molecules that are floppy or exhibit large amplitude motion , examples of which will be presented in this work .    a more general perturbative method for solving the rovibrational problem beyond the watson hamiltonian is thus desirable .",
    "non - rigid systems introduce several complications : ( i ) the need for curvilinear , rather than rectilinear , coordinates ; ( ii ) a representation of the potential energy surface ( pes ) and nuclear kinetic energy operator ( keo ) beyond a power series expansion ; and ( iii ) a more general quasi - eckart frame embedding not tied to a single reference geometry , an assumption that may not have a physical basis in some systems .",
    "recent developments in curvilinear hybrid variational - perturbative methods  @xcite have considered the first of these concerns .",
    "we base our approach on vibrational self - consistent field theory ( vscf )  @xcite augmented by second order vibrational mller ",
    "plesset perturbation theory ( vmp2 )  @xcite , which is capable of addressing all three of these issues .",
    "vmp2 is analogous to the electronic mp2 method  @xcite : after performing a mean - field vscf calculation , vibrational correlation effects are taken into account via rayleigh ",

    "have been successfully extended to curvilinear reaction path hamiltonians  @xcite , as well as more general curvilinear vibrational hamiltonians  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we further develop the curvilinear vmp2 method to include the rotational part of the total molecular hamiltonian .",
    "we calculate effective rotational and rovibrational hamiltonians by applying a second order contact transformation to the rovibrational problem solved to zeroth order by vscf .",
    "a major task for including molecular rotation is the proper choice of a body - fixed frame that sufficiently decouples rotational and vibrational motion so that the perturbative approach is viable . to this end , we implement a quasi - eckart embedding suitable for molecules that undergo even completely unhindered large amplitude motion and therefore have no well - defined equilibrium geometry .",
    "the rovibrational keo in this embedding , as well as the standard eckart embedding , is evaluated numerically from an analytical method that does not rely on approximate finite difference derivatives , making it both efficient and accurate .    after discussing the theoretical details ,",
    "we present specific applications to two representative non - rigid molecules .",
    "the first is disilicon carbide , si@xmath0c . while this molecule does have a well defined si ",
    "c  si bent equilibrium geometry  @xcite , the barrier to linearity is relatively small ( @xmath2800  @xmath3 )  @xcite .",
    "the low energy bending mode , which has a fundamental frequency of only 142  @xmath3  @xcite , is highly anharmonic and causes problems for vpt2 in combination with a standard rectilinear quartic force field ( qff ) .",
    "curvilinear vmp2 provides an improved description of both the vibrational and rotational structure of this quasilinear system .",
    "numerically exact variational energies are readily available for this small molecule , permitting an `` apples - to - apples '' benchmark of the rovibrational vmp2 results .",
    "the second system we discuss is nitromethane , ch@xmath1no@xmath0 , which exhibits nearly barrierless internal rotation of the methyl group with respect to the no@xmath0 plane  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "standard vpt2 is qualitatively incapable of treating the large amplitude motion , total rotation , and the interactions between them .",
    "we show that the combination of a flexible choice of curvilinear internal coordinates and quasi - eckart embedding enables vmp2 to predict an accurate effective torsional - rotational hamiltonian for this challenging system .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the vscf method , which we use to generate zeroth order solutions , and the standard vmp2 perturbative correction .",
    "we then describe our extension of vmp2 to account for both vibrational correlation and rovibrational effects .",
    "this is followed by a presentation of the detailed form of the rovibrational hamiltonian , as well as a discussion of the choice of internal coordinate systems and molecule frame embedding .",
    "the goal of vscf is to find the variationally optimal solution to the vibrational hamiltonian within a hartree product wavefunction ansatz , @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the @xmath6 curvilinear internal coordinates . in ket notation , we write this as @xmath7 the one - dimensional ( 1d ) wavefunction for each vibrational degree of freedom is determined by solving an effective one - body schrdinger equation , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mean - field one - body hamiltonian for mode @xmath10 , found by computing the expectation value of the vibrational ( @xmath11 ) hamiltonian @xmath12 over all other degrees of freedom @xmath13 .",

    "is given the name vibrational second order mller ",
    "plesset perturbation theory or vmp2 . for the pure vibrational problem ,",
    "one finds the vmp2 energy by computing the standard rayleigh ",
    "schrdinger perturbative corrections , @xmath15 in this formulation , there is no first order contribution because the zeroth order hamiltonian corresponds to the diagonal of the exact hamiltonian in the vscf basis .",
    "the standard vmp2 method described above provides approximate solutions to the vibrational ( @xmath11 ) hamiltonian @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the vibrational keo and @xmath18 is the potential energy surface .",
    "the full rovibrational hamiltonian for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , consists of additional keo terms accounting for rotational kinetic energy ( @xmath21 ) and rovibrational coupling ( @xmath22 ) . with the exception of degenerate or near - degenerate vibrational states , the energy scales of @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "are typically one to several orders of magnitude smaller than the spacings between vibrational states .",
    "thus , the rotational structure of an isolated vibrational state may be adequately predicted by accounting for interactions with other vibrational states perturbatively .",
    "this is the essential idea behind the so - called contact or van vleck transformation  @xcite , which forms the foundation for the development of empirical effective rotational hamiltonians  @xcite .",

    "matrix elements between different vibrational blocks , e.g. @xmath39 and @xmath42 , have contributions only from @xmath30 , which we formally assign as being of order @xmath34 .",
    "the contact transformation entails defining a new hamiltonian @xmath38 that is related to the original hamiltonian @xmath28 by the transformation @xmath43 where @xmath44 is hermitian . as @xmath45 is unitary ,",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath38 are equivalent to those of @xmath28 .",
    "the operator @xmath44 is chosen to block diagonalize @xmath38 up to a given order in @xmath32 . in this work , we go to second order , which , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : heff ] , eliminates the @xmath34 off - diagonal matrix elements between the target vibrational state @xmath24 and the rest of the hilbert space , leaving off - diagonal blocks of order @xmath46 that are then neglected .",

    "note that @xmath51 by definition and that @xmath52 because the vibrational factor of each term of @xmath22 is a real , anti - hermitian operator ( see section  [ sec : rovibh ] below ) .",
    "finally , the second order contribution is @xmath53    as can be seen , each term of the effective hamiltonian can be written as a pure rotational operator , independent of the actual choice of basis @xmath40 .",

    "the effective rotational hamiltonian can be reduced to six independent quadratic operators and fifteen independent quartic operators  @xcite .",
    "further application of similarity transformations and commutation relations can simultaneously eliminate the three off - diagonal quadratic operators ( e.g. @xmath58 ) and ten of the quartic operators , leaving a total of three quadratic operators and five quartic operators .",

    "the effective multistate hamiltonian is determined by a perturbation series similar to eqs .",

    "the new zeroth order eigenvectors of course have new zeroth order energies @xmath64 that equal the eigenvalues of the block of @xmath12 over the @xmath59 configurations .",
    "using the zeroth order states @xmath63 , we compute the multistate effective hamiltonian to second order as    @xmath65    where the sum over @xmath66 is for vibrational vscf configurations @xmath67 not in the original resonant block @xmath59 .    in the multistate case , we can not reduce the effective hamiltonian without prior knowledge of the rovibrational interaction mechanisms at work . therefore standard spectroscopic constants can not be automatically generated from the contact transformation sums alone , as is done with a single vibrational state effective hamiltonian .",
    "instead , we initially proceed in a `` model agnostic '' fashion by numerically diagonalizing the resonant block of the effective hamiltonian generated directly from eq .",
    "[ eq : multiheff ] .",
    "this diagonalization is inexpensive , the effective hamiltonian being only of dimension @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the number of zeroth order vibrational states included in the resonant vibrational set .",
    "the energy eigenvalues can then be used directly or , as we do in this work , subsequently fit to a model hamiltonian to facilitate comparison with observed spectroscopic constants obtained by fitting the same model hamiltonian to experimental transition frequencies .",
    "we note that by discarding the off - diagonal rovibrational matrix elements in the multistate effective hamiltonian , the diagonal block corresponding to each vibrational level provides an estimate of the `` deperturbed '' vibrational energies and rotational constants of the zeroth order states . while these deperturbed molecular constants do not yield direct predictions of the observable rovibrational energies",
    ", they are still quite useful , often revealing patterns and physical insights into the rovibrational structure that are otherwise obscured by strong perturbations .",

    "often , only terms up to modest orders ( much less than @xmath6 ) are necessary for an accurate , and significantly more efficient , representation of the full @xmath6-dimensional function .",
    "the accuracy of the truncated expansion depends critically on the approximate separability of the function with respect to the chosen degrees of freedom .",
    "the proper choice of internal coordinate system is therefore a primary consideration .    in some cases ,",
    "a particular coordinate may be unfit for the many - body expansion , especially if a single reference value is not well determined or if no single fixed geometry respects the total symmetry of the molecule ( for example , the rotation angle of an unhindered internal rotor ) .",
    "we generalize the many - body expansion by allowing for one or more `` dereferenced '' coordinates . in this case , for all values of the set of dereferenced coordinates , a separate many - body expansion is generated over the remaining non - dereferenced coordinates .",
    "the formulation of the hamiltonian in the previous section permits general curvilinear coordinate systems to be employed ( with some exceptions in cases of accessible keo singularities , which we do not discuss in detail here ) .",

    "the deficiency of the vpt2 treatment is rooted in the rectilinear coordinates and quartic force field ( qff ) representation of the potential energy surface . here",
    "we show that rotational vmp2 , in light of its improved zero order picture relative to vpt2 , can provide accurate rotational and vibrational predictions , while being significantly less expensive than variational rovibrational calculations .",
    "the primitive si@xmath0c coordinate system used in the vmp2 calculations consists of the two @xmath150 bond lengths and the @xmath151si  c  si angle .",
    "the curvilinear normal coordinates are constructed by a t - type transformation of the primitive coordinates , with the transformation matrix determined by a gf normal mode calculation at the bent si@xmath0c equilibrium geometry . we use a standard eckart embedding referenced to the si@xmath0c equilibrium geometry in its principal axis system .",
    "all many - body expansions were taken to third order ( i.e. exact ) , so that no approximations are made in the construction of the rovibrational hamiltonian .",
    "the size of the 1d dvr basis sets in the vscf portion of the calculation as well as the size of the virtual configuration space in the vmp2 sums were both enlarged until the vibrational energies converged to the reported precision .",
    "the vmp2 , vpt2 , and variational calculations were all performed with a potential surface calculated at the frozen core ( fc)-ccsd(t)/cc - pvqz level of theory , with the variational results taken from our previous work  @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : si2c ] compares the quartic rotational hamiltonian predictions for the vibrational ground state as well as the excited fundamental levels .",
    "the vmp2 predictions are in excellent agreement with the corresponding benchmark variational values : the vibrational fundamentals differ by less than 0.03 @xmath3 , and the @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath146 constants differ by only @xmath20.010.1% for both the ground and fundamental vibrational states . in contrast , the vpt2/qff predictions are considerably less accurate .",
    "the vibrational fundamentals have errors on the order of @xmath210  @xmath3 .",
    "most strikingly , the predicted ground state @xmath152 constant has an error of several hundreds of  mhz , and the predicted @xmath152 constant for the @xmath154 bending level is more than 2  ghz low .",

    "c  si angle approaches 180@xmath155 , the @xmath156 axis moment of inertia vanishes .",
    "thus , the @xmath152 constant is particularly sensitive to the vibrational wavefunction , so much so that even the zero - point bending motion in the ground vibrational state is not well described by vpt2 relative to vmp2 and the variational benchmark .",
    "the centrifugal distortion ( cd ) constants provide an additional measure of the accuracy of the rotational vmp2 treatment .",
    "the error relative to the the benchmark value for the @xmath157 constant , which was the only cd parameter well determined in the fits of the variational energies , is small for each of the ground and fundamental vibrational states .",
    "furthermore , the agreement of the vmp2 predictions with the observed values for all five quartic cd constants of the ground state is quite good .",
    "it is difficult to compare the vmp2 cd constants with the observed values for fundamental vibrational levels as the current set of observed microwave transitions in these states has permitted only a partial determination of the quartic cd parameters . given the accuracy of the vmp2 ground state predictions , the excited state predictions could possibly aid in the experimental search for additional transitions .",
    "it is worth noting that the magnitude of the error between the vmp2 and variational vibrational frequencies and rotational constants is typically far less than that with respect to the observed values .",
    "that is , the rotational vmp2 method , for this molecule at least , is presumably accurate enough such that the underlying potential energy surface / quantum chemistry remains the major source of _ ab initio _ error .",
    "thus , even more accurate predictions can be estimated by applying corrections based on higher level electronic structure calculations .",
