    "granular materials @xcite come in many forms , from soils , sands , and grains to powders and pharmaceuticals . however , despite their prevalence , there are still open questions about how the seemingly simple interactions of contact forces lead to the observed emergent behavior of these systems .",
    "an active area of research lies in understanding the mechanisms that govern deformation in granular materials subjected to compression and shear . under both of these external perturbations ,",
    "the force network of granular systems exhibits complex and inhomogeneous structure in the form of strongly interacting collections of particles known as _ force chains _ ( see fig .  [",
    "f : experiment]_c _ ) @xcite .",
    "this architecture is thought to constrain the mechanical properties and stability of granular materials @xcite and may also be responsible for nonlinear and heterogeneous features of acoustic signal transmission @xcite .",
    "two notable features of force chains are that they are _ mesoscale _ structures , intermediately sized between the particle scale and the system scale , and that their physical structure depends on the loading history @xcite .",
    "these characteristics present a challenge , as there is currently no single modeling framework that explicitly addresses the presence of mesoscale architecture in particulate systems and how it reconfigures under external influences .",
    "the development of such models is critical , as particulate and continuum methods can not fully describe the observed properties exhibited by these systems @xcite .",
    "recently , a number of studies have suggested that graph theoretic @xcite approaches provide a powerful and natural paradigm in which to study granular media .",
    "many of these analyses have focused on the characterization of discrete sets of static granular force networks throughout compression @xcite , tapping @xcite , or tilting @xcite , using traditional graph metrics such as degree , clustering coefficients , and cycles of different lengths .",
    "other work has probed the dynamical nature of sheared systems by considering time - evolving networks of broken - links @xcite , and grain property networks have been used to understand rearrangements in discrete element simulations of compressed systems @xcite .",
    "methods from algebraic topology , and in particular , persistent homology @xcite have also been used to quantify the evolution of force networks , providing important insights into the nature of compressed @xcite and tapped @xcite granular materials .",
    "one reason for the promise of network - based measures is that they can assess material architecture at a range of length scales , including the important mesoscale regime .",
    "recent work by @xcite showed that a network clustering technique known as _ community detection _ could be used to extract the underlying mesoscale force chain structure from static granular networks . in this study , we extend the static model , and suggest that _ multilayer networks _ may be a particularly promising framework in which to simultaneously examine the mesoscale architecture of granular systems , as well as to probe network evolution and reconfiguration in a straightfoward manner .",
    "this novel approach has thus far been unexplored .",
    "multilayer networks encompass several different types of complex graph constructions , and the word can take on a number of meanings depending on the context ( see @xcite for comprehensive reviews ) .",
    "for example , a multilayer network may capture different types of connections between nodes , may quantify interactions between different systems , or may be used to study dynamical processes that occur across time . here , we focus on a specific subset of these possibilities .",
    "in particular , we restrict ourselves to _ temporal networks _ with _ diagonal _ and _ ordinal _ inter - layer couplings .",
    "temporal _ network consists of a sequential series of static graphs ( the layers ) ordered such that time - dependence is accounted for . _",
    "diagonal _ couplings mean that a node in one layer is only connected to itself in other layers . finally , _",
    "inter - layer couplings only allow connections between layers that are adjacent to each other in time . in this study , we are interested in the evolution of a granular material as it undergoes biaxial compression .",
    "we thus represent a snapshot of the system at a particular point in its evolution as a spatially embedded graph where particles are nodes and inter - particle forces are weighted edges . repeating this process at several discrete strain steps yields an ordered set of static networks , which can then be combined into a single multilayer graph with the temporal dependence set by the order of the strain steps .",
    "we develop and apply this multilayer network formalism to experimental granular data @xcite to ( i ) extract evolving mesoscale structure from the force network , ( ii ) understand how this architecture reconfigures throughout compressive ( strain ) steps , ( iii ) uncover physical properties of evolving mesostructures and relate them to measures of network rearrangement , and ( iv ) examine the impact of inter - particle friction on multilayer mesostructures . to achieve this , we represent an ensemble of granular packings as multilayer graphs using the set of force networks ( both normal and tangential ) obtained from each step above the jamming point .",
    "we then use _ multilayer community detection _ to extract groups of particles that evolve together throughout the compression procedure .",
    "this method allows us to directly characterize the progression of inherent mesoscale organization as a function of strain step .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec.[s : experimental_methods ] we describe the granular experiments .",
    "[ s : math_model ] is dedicated to an explanation of the multilayer network model and community detection , which lay the theoretical foundations for the rest of the paper .",
    "a series of results describing the granular network evolution are presented in sec .",
    "[ s : results ] , and in sec .",
    "[ s : discussion ] we discuss broader implications of our method and findings , and directions for future work .",
    "we study the biaxial compression of a granular monolayer on a nearly frictionless surface provided by an air table ( fig .",
    "[ f : experiment ] ) .",
    "the system is composed of an inner subsystem and an outer bath which differ only in the inter - particle friction coefficient . at the beginning of each compression cycle , the system is in a dilute , unjammed state and is then compressed quasistatically until it is highly stressed . by repeating this protocol many times",
    ", we generate an ensemble of configurations for which we record particle positions ( fig .",
    "[ f : experiment]_b _ ) , and use photoelastic measurements ( fig .",
    "[ f : experiment]_c _ ) to calculate contact forces @xcite .",
    "the presence of the subsystem and bath allows us to characterize both the system as a whole , and to investigate the physical differences that exist between the high- and low - friction regions .",
    "the inner subsystem and bath are composed of 100 and 904 particles , respectively .",
    "the two systems are both composed of a bidisperse mixture of disks ( diameters @xmath0 = 11 mm and @xmath1 = 15.4 mm , in equal concentrations ) , which differ only in the inter - particle friction coefficient .",
    "the friction coefficient for the inner subsystem is @xmath2 and for the high friction bath is @xmath3 .    a single ccd camera located above the apparatus records three separate images of the system : unpolarized white light for the particle positions , polarized light for recording the photoelastic response , and ultraviolet light for identifying the subsystem particles , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : experiment ] . using the photoelastic image",
    ", we measure the normal and tangential forces at each contact on each disk in the assembly . to calculate the forces",
    ", we use a nonlinear least squares optimization algorithm @xcite to minimize the error between the observed and fitted image of the particle .",
    "details and source code are available for download at @xcite .",
    "the third image , taken using a black - light illumination , identifies which particles are low - friction via their fluorescent marking .",
    "each compression cycle begins with an initial dilute state with global packing fraction @xmath4 . in the dilute state ,",
    "the granular system is unjammed and unable to support stress .",
    "two walls then biaxially compress the system in a series of small steps of constant size ( @xmath5 , equivalently @xmath6  mm or 0.02@xmath7 ) . as the system is compressed via these discrete , quasistatic steps , we observe the percolation of force chains throughout both the bath and the subsystem at a value @xmath8 .",
    "this is the onset of rigidity , and as the system is further compressed beyond this point , the contact forces grow in strength and the average number of contacts per particle increases . for each of the 97 configurations we locate @xmath8 as the step at which photoelastic signals are first present , and consider the evolution of the system due to the subsequent applied strain steps .",
    "further details of the experimental apparatus and measurements were published previously @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the construction of a multilayer network requires knowledge about which node ( particle ) is which from one layer ( strain step ) to the next @xcite . under the dynamics described above",
    ", we are assured that no particles are removed from or added to the system , and we similarly require that the multilayer network also has this constraint .",
    "( in general , multilayer graphs can indeed be constructed for growing systems , where the number of nodes is constantly changing . ) in order to correctly identify the particles in each layer , we use the blair - dufresne particle tracking algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm , implemented in matlab , requires the choice of a `` displacement '' parameter , which is an estimate of the maximum distance that a particle moves between consecutive frames .",
    "as we do not expect large particle displacements in the jammed packings , we initialize the tracking with a displacement parameter value that is much less than the minimum particle diameter @xmath0 , and increase the allowed displacement in small steps until all particles are tracked consistently across all steps .",
    "in general , _ temporal _ multilayer networks are mathematical objects that describe and quantify the evolution of networked systems as a function of time or some other variable of interest @xcite .",
    "the construction of such a multilayer network first requires a set of individual networks that describe the system at discrete steps in its evolution .",
    "these static `` layers '' can each be represented as an adjacency matrix , @xmath9 , describing the connectivity and weight connecting the nodes in the given layer .",
    "the set of adjacency matrices may then be combined into a rank-3 adjacency tensor , @xmath10 @xcite , to form a multilayer network representation of the system .",
    "the elements of @xmath10 are defined such that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the weight between nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 in layer @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the total number of layers ( steps ) .    for the present situation , we are interested in how the force network of a granular packing reconfigures through a sequence of compressive steps above @xmath8 .",
    "we thus wish to represent the system as an ordered , temporal multilayer network , which captures the evolution of the system as a function of compression . to form such a network , we thus let nodes be particles , weighted edges be the forces between contacting particles , and the number of strain steps be the third dimension across which we observe changes in network structure .",
    "using the force information obtained from the photoelastic disk experiments , we construct two multilayer force networks for a given experimental run , one using the normal forces , @xmath17 , between particles and another using the magnitude of the tangential forces @xmath18 .",
    "specifically , we denote the normal force adjacency tensor as @xmath19 , defined as in eq .",
    "[ eq : adjacency_tensor_general ] with @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the normal force between particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 at step @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , we write the tangential force adjacency tensor as @xmath22 , defined as in eq .  [ eq : adjacency_tensor_general ] with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the tangential force between particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 at step @xmath15 .",
    "this process is repeated for all of the experimental configurations , resulting in a large ensemble of multilayer networks . in fig .",
    "[ f : photoelastic_evolution ] , we show an example set of photoelastic images with the corresponding network of normal forces overlaid .",
    "in addition to the _ intra_-layer weights , multilayer networks have a second set of _",
    "inter_-layer edges that connect nodes in different layers of the network . in this study",
    ", we consider only _ diagonal _ and _ ordinal _ inter - layer couplings , meaning that a given particle is connected only to itself ( i.e. diagonal coupling ) inter - layer edges exist only between _ adjacent _ layers ( i.e ordinal coupling ) .",
    "the inter - layer weights are crucial to the structure of the network ; in sec .",
    "[ s : choosing_omega ] , we discuss how these couplings are chosen for the granular system at hand .",
    "this graphical construction is a powerful approach .",
    "importantly , each layer of the adjacency tensor encodes both the topology ( connectivity ) as well as the strength of interactions between particles in the system at a given packing fraction .",
    "we will see that the extension to a _ multilayer _",
    "framework not only allows one to study the static behavior of granular packings , but also promotes a direct investigation and characterization of the evolution of the system throughout the compressive steps .      a compelling reason to use graphical representations of spatially embedded systems @xcite is that network theoretic approaches provide a means to extract and characterize organization that is present at a range of length scales .",
    "granular materials are a prime example of a complex system in which multiple length scales are relevant to a full understanding of the system and to a prediction of bulk properties .",
    "for example , the fundamental interactions in these systems are local in the sense that they occur between nearest neighbor particles .",
    "but under compression , those local interactions lead to important heterogeneous structure at the _ mesoscale _ in the form of force chains @xcite .    in the present study , we aim to both extract mesoscale structures from the force network , and then characterize the reconfiguration that occurs in these structures due to the applied strain steps . in order to accomplish this , we build upon recent approaches that utilize _ community detection _ techniques to extract groups of strongly interacting particles from the granular network @xcite , generalizing the methods to the multilayer regime .    a _ community _ or _",
    "module _ in a network is a set of nodes that are densely interconnected amongst themselves , and relatively weakly connected to other nodes @xcite .",
    "the extraction of community structure is of general interest in network science , as it is thought that these mesoscale units are important to the function of many real systems @xcite .",
    "several community detection methods exist @xcite ; here , we apply the popular method of _ modularity maximization _ , whereby nodes are partitioned into communities via maximization of a quality function known as _ modularity _",
    "@xcite .          in a single layer network with adjacency matrix * a * , modularity is given by @xmath25 \\delta(c_{i},c_{j } ) , \\label{eq : static_modularity}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the community of node @xmath13 , @xmath27 is the community of node @xmath14 , @xmath28 is the expected edge weight between nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 under a specified null model , and @xmath29 is the _ structural resolution parameter_. in the overall normalization , @xmath30 , which is the weighted degree or _ strength _ of the network .",
    "the structural resolution parameter @xmath29 allows for the control of size and number of communities : smaller @xmath29 leads to larger communities , and larger @xmath29 leads to smaller communities .",
    "maximization of @xmath31 with respect to the assignment of nodes to communities yields a partition in which intra - community connections are as strong as possible relative to the null model .",
    "it is important to note , however , that modularity maximization is np - hard @xcite and should therefore be repeated several times for the same network and set of parameters in order to obtain an ensemble of optimizations @xcite . throughout this work",
    ", we use a louvain - like locally greedy algorithm for modularity maximization @xcite .",
    "a proper choice of null model is vital to community detection techniques , as it affects both the interpretation and utility of the community structures obtained @xcite .",
    "the most commonly used null model in the literature is the newman - girvan ( ng ) model @xcite , which in the case of a static network is given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the strength of node @xmath13 , and @xmath34 is the total strength of the network , as before . in the newman - girvan model ( which is",
    "also sometimes referred to as the _ configuration model _ ) , @xmath28 gives the expected edge weight between nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 in a randomized network that has the same weighted degree distribution as the real network . as a randomized version of the real graph ,",
    "the ng model is most appropriate to use as a null model in situations where all connections between nodes are at least _",
    "possible_. in many physical or spatially embedded systems , however , this is not the case , and there are constraints that prevent the existence of several edges .",
    "for example , in the granular networks considered here , edges can only exist between nearest neighbor particles , and it is imperative to consider this fact when designing a null model for these types of systems .",
    "a better choice in this instance is the physically informed _ geographical null model _",
    "@xcite , defined to be @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the average inter - particle force ( either normal or tangential ) in the network and @xmath37 is the contact matrix , with elements @xmath38 because this null model maintains the contact structure of the real network , it importantly takes into account the physical constraints on the possible patterns of connectivity between particles .",
    "additionally , it selects for strongly connected sets of particles carrying forces larger than @xmath39 .       * a schematic of a multilayer network with layer - dependent community structure . *",
    "each layer represents a static granular force network in which nodes ( particles ) are connected to one another via intra - layer weighted edges .",
    "these weights can be either the normal contact forces or the absolute value of the tangential contact forces .",
    "additionally , the same particle in consecutive layers is linked to itself with an inter - layer coupling , @xmath40 . for clarity ,",
    "we only show two such couplings , but these inter - layer edges exist between all particles ( and across all layers ) .",
    "evolving communities are extracted from the multilayer network to study the mesoscale organization in the system , and to understand how it reconfigures due to the compressive cycle .",
    "the community structure can be determined from the network by maximizing the multilayer modularity , @xmath41 ( eq .  [ eq : dynamic_modularity ] ) . in this",
    "schematic , the particles belonging to different communities are labeled by different colors . note that the same community can persist across all layers and reconfigure in terms of particle content and strength throughout compression . ]    when community detection is performed on a series of single layer granular networks , such as those obtained here after each applied strain step , the result is a set of _ independent _ partitions of particles into communities at each step ( fig .",
    "[ f : static_norm_comms ] ) . as demonstrated in @xcite , the communities at a given step correspond to sets of strongly interacting groups of particles , and are clearly reminiscent of physical force chains observed in the photoelastic disk experiments .",

    "in addition to @xmath29 , the multilayer modularity requires another free parameter , @xmath40 ( often referred to as an _ inter - layer coupling _ or _ temporal resolution parameter _ ) which sets the the strength of connections between layers .",

    "is given by @xmath53 . finally , in the overall normalization",

    "importantly , the communities can persist across all layers and we can track their reconfiguration in terms of particle content and strength throughout the series of strain steps .    as in the formulation of @xmath31 ,",
    "the choice of null model in @xmath41 is an important one , particularly when considering systems with strict constraints on the allowed connectivity between nodes . for granular networks ,",
    "we generalize the geographical null model to the multilayer regime . for community detection on the normal force network",

    "the two parameters in the multilayer modularity quality function , @xmath40 and @xmath29 , must be chosen by the investigator .",
    "recall that the structural resolution parameter , @xmath29 , regulates the size and number of detected communities ; in this study , we use @xmath66 for all @xmath15 . as can be seen from eq .",

    "we make a physically informed choice .",
    "as described in the previous section , @xmath40 is in general a tensor that can take on different values between each layer or for different nodes . since to our knowledge",
    "this is the first study on multilayer granular networks , we begin by taking the simplest case of a scalar inter - layer coupling , choosing @xmath40 to be the same for all particles and all pairs of layers , such that @xmath67 for all @xmath68 . however , it is important to point out that the inter - layer coupling could be different for different particles .",

    "investigation of more complicated methods for choosing the inter - layer couplings may be an interesting direction for future work .",
    "to proceed , it is necessary to understand the effect of @xmath40 on the community structure .",
    "there are two limiting cases which are relatively simple to grasp : when @xmath69 , there are no connections between layers of the adjacency tensor , and we therefore expect to recover the results of static community detection ( fig .",

    "the modularity of the tangential forces is less affected by temporal scrambling than that of the normal forces .",

    "we construct a null model , @xmath142 , by permuting the edge weights uniformly at random within each layer while maintaining the original contact topology and ordering of slices ( for a related but distinct null model , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that the organization of inter - particle forces is crucial for the stability of granular packings .",
    "this fact is manifested in force chains , branching groups of particles that bear the majority of the load in the system .",
    "therefore , for the multilayer model to be useful , it should not be agnostic to the pattern of forces present in physically realizable systems . for each of the 97 configurations",

    ", we expect the synthetic networks to display more reconfiguration and less modular structure than the physical networks .",
    "we observe that the diagnostics of multilayer community structure are highly distinguishable between the real multilayer force networks and the null model ( fig .",
    "[ f : null_models]_f , i _ ) . in particular , the force - permuted networks exhibit more flexibility , @xmath139 , less stationarity @xmath140 , and decreased modularity @xmath143 for both the normal and tangential components than expected in the null model .",
    "these results confirm our hypothesis that the evolution of network structure is less variable and undergoes less reorganization in the real system , and that the modularity stronger . in the appendix  [ a : promiscuity ] , we additionally show that these results hold for the promiscuity .    the findings presented in this section crucially demonstrate that the multilayer network model and community detection are sensitive to differences in the structural evolution of the compressed system compared to three relevant null models , with respect to @xmath70 , @xmath117 , and @xmath144 .",
    "in particular , we can distinguish between the evolution of the granular networks and null models with consistent topology and weights , scrambled temporal layers , or scrambled edge weights ( but same topological structure ) .",
    "even more importantly , the differences in the reconfiguration agree with what is expected from a physical standpoint , making evident the powerful utility of this framework .      in the previous section , we examined three measures to quantify the community structure of the multilayer granular network .",
    "however , the diagnostics we considered did not directly describe the evolution of physical properties of the mesoscale organization .",
    "we turn now to a physical description of the network architecture , and define measures to quantify both the strength and geometry of community structure throughout compression .",
    "we then ask whether the physical properties of mesoscale particle assemblies can be related to the measures of structural reconfiguration previously defined .",
    "we characterize the physical nature of community structure with three measures : _ size _ , _ strength _ , and _",
    "sparsity _ , and examine how these quantities evolve throughout compression . similarly to the previous section , we consider and compare both the normal and tangential force network .",
    "the size @xmath145 of community @xmath110 at strain step @xmath15 is simply the number of particles within the community at that step .",
    "we denote the strength of a community at layer @xmath15 as @xmath146 , and define it to be the average amount of force ( normalized by the mean force in the layer ) on a particle in community @xmath110 from intra - community contacts .",
    "mathematically , @xmath147 where @xmath10 is either the normalized normal or tangential force network .",
    "finally , we consider a measure of spatial compactness , which we term the community sparsity , @xmath148 .",
    "the sparsity of a community is closely related to the _ hull ratio _",
    ", which has been defined and used to quantify the geometric arrangement of compressed particle assemblies @xcite .",
    "the hull ratio @xmath149 of a community at strain step @xmath15 can be understood as the ratio of the area @xmath150 of particles in the community to the area of the convex hull of the group @xmath151 , such that @xmath152 where the area of particle @xmath13 is @xmath153 , with @xmath154 equal to the particle radius .",
    "we then take the community sparsity at layer @xmath15 to be @xmath155 with this definition , small values of @xmath156 correspond to spatially dense groups of particles , and high values of @xmath156 correspond to sparse particle configurations .",
    "we now use each of these physical characteristics to quantify the evolution of the mesoscale community structure throughout the compression process . given a partition of particles into communities ,",
    "we compute @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath157 at each strain step @xmath15 , for all communities except those which have @xmath158 for all @xmath15 ( i.e. , they are always singletons ) .",
    "we then define @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 to be the average over all communities present in layer @xmath15 ,    @xmath162    @xmath163    @xmath164    where @xmath165 is the number of communities present in layer @xmath15 . repeating this process for all community detection optimizations and all particle configurations , we form representative curves of each physical quantity as a function of strain step by averaging the measures defined above first over optimizations and then over experimental configurations .",
    "we denote the final averaged physical quantities for size , strength , and sparsity as @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 , respectively .",
    "we first observe that the size of the mesoscale structure increases smoothly as a function of the strain steps , ( fig .",
    "[ f : comm_physical ] _ a _ ) , suggesting that the scale of the mesostructure organization grows with compression . however , the normal force communities are noticeably larger in size , and undergo relatively more growth throughout strain steps than the communities from the tangential network .",
    "these differences imply that the network of normal forces exhibits collective organization on a larger scale than that of the tangential force network ; and that the normal force network responds differently to increasing pressure . some of these features are partially recognizable by eye in comparing the community structure in fig .",
    "[ f : multilayer_communities]_a _ and fig .",
    "[ f : multilayer_communities]_b_. we also find that the community strength increases smoothly over the applied strain steps , for both the normal and tangential components .",
    "this behavior signifies the mesoscale architecture becoming more strongly connected throughout compression , which agrees with the physical expectation .",
    "note that the average community strength @xmath167 was computed on the normalized networks ( see sec .",
    "[ s : multi_mod_max ] ) , which explains the similar scale between the normal and tangential curves .",
    "finally , we observe a slight decrease in community sparsity across strain steps , especially during the beginning stages .",
    "in addition , the tangential network displays lower sparsity than that of the normal force network , implying more compact tangential community structure .",
    "this feature is likely tied to the smaller size of tangential communities , which constrains the set of possible spatial arrangements of the particles within a community .",
    "in addition to quantifying the average behavior of mesoscale architecture , it is also important to investigate the behavior of individual communities throughout compression .",
    "though it is possible that all communities progress similarly to the average behavior of the system ( for example , coalescing to create communities of increasing size and strength , but decreasing sparsity ) , this does not have to be the case .",
    "we find , in fact , that the situation is quite the opposite ; at the level of single communities , the evolution of physical structure varies greatly .",
    "we demonstrate this in a simple way .",
    "first , we identify the number of communities that exhibit linear trends with respect to size , strength , or sparsity as a function of strain step .",
    "tables [ t : normal_trends ] and [ t : tangential_trends ] show the results of this analysis for the normal and tangential networks .",
    "we observe that the majority of mesostructures do _ not _ exhibit consistent and predictable linear trends in terms of their physical properties throughout the compression process .",
    "while some linear tendencies are much more likely to occur than others ( for example , increasing strength and decreasing sparsity ) , the behavior of many communities can not be characterized by a simple linear relationship .",
    "this surprising results highlights the important diversity of mesoscale structural evolution .    .[t",
    ": normal_trends ] percentages of communities from the network of normal forces that exhibit linear trends with respect to strength @xmath169 or sparsity @xmath156 throughout compression .",
    "the numbers reported correspond to averages over optimizations and packings , and errors are the standard errors of the mean .

[",
    "f : force_hull_trend ] , we plot the slope of the linear regression fit of sparsity _ vs. _ the slope of strength , for each community in all optimizations and experimental packings .",
    "again , the scatter plots point to the variation of mesostructure development , as all quadrants ( with the exception of the upper left ) are significantly filled in .",
    "these data support the notion that communities may coalesce , disband , or become increasingly branch - like , and each of these behaviors is observable as the packing rearranges under compression .    to quantify the co - dependence of the two statistics , we first find the number of communities ( i.e. the intersection ) that fall within each quadrant for each optimization and packing .",
    "for example , if @xmath170 are the communities with linearly increasing strength and @xmath171 are those with linearly increasing sparsity , then we compute the number of communities that satisfy @xmath172 ( upper right quadrant of the scatter plots ) . then to determine how often increasing strength ( @xmath170 ) occurs with increasing sparsity ( @xmath171 ) , for example , we normalize the intersection by the total number of communities with @xmath170 .",
    "conversely , if we want to know the percentage of communities with increasing sparsity ( @xmath171 ) that also have increasing strength ( @xmath170 ) , then we would instead divide the intersection by the number of communities in @xmath171 .",
    "table [ t : trend_together ] in appendix  [ a : table_trend ] shows the percentages for each of the possible combinations .",
    "the strongest relationship occurs between communities with @xmath173 and @xmath174 . in this case",
    ", we find that if a community has linearly decreasing strength with strain step , then it is likely to also be more compact ( but note that not many communities decrease in strength in the first place ) .",
    "these results may be due to the community losing particles and thus becoming more dense ( on average for the normal ( tangential ) network , @xmath175 ( @xmath176 ) of communities with linearly decreasing strength and sparsity also have linearly decreasing size ) .",
    "the nearly empty upper left quadrants are consistent with this relationship as well ; communities with decreasing strength rarely become more spatially spread out throughout compression .",
    "we also find that on average , more than half of the communities with increasing sparsity also have increasing strength , which is likely due to the community gaining particles , thus allowing it to take on configurations which are more spatially extended ( on average for the normal ( tangential ) network , @xmath177 ( @xmath178 ) of communities with linearly increasing strength and sparsity also have linearly increasing size ) .     * scatter plots demonstrating the diversity of network evolution*. the relationship between the slopes of communities that exhibit linear trends with respect to strength and sparsity .",
    "for both the normal _ ( a ) _ and tangential _ ( b ) _ force networks , all but the upper left quadrant are quite populated , pointing to the diversity in the evolution of community structure throughout the compression process . ]",
    "thus far , we have independently characterized the evolution of multilayer community structure using notions of particle rearrangement ( flexibility and stationarity ) , and using physical quantities , ( size , strength , and sparsity ) .",
    "we now attempt to link these two ideas together , asking whether network reconfiguration can be related to physical aspects of the network .",
    "we first investigate the relationship between particle flexibility , @xmath179 ( eq .  [ eq : node_flex ] ) and the inter - particle force , @xmath180 .",
    "recall that @xmath179 is a measure of _ local _ reconfiguration in that it is defined for a single particle , but it is determined from the _ mesoscale _ community structure of the network . for every multilayer community partition ( 20 for each particle configuration ) , we compute the flexibility of each particle as given in eq .",

    "[ s : local_reconfiguration ] , where high values of force and change in force across compression were associated with high values of local reconfiguration  a similar relationship holds for reconfiguration at the intermediate scale as well .",
    "we have additionally shown that if a community experiences large changes in its particle content , then the spatial arrangement of the community s particles undergoes restructuring as well , agreeing with physical intuition .",
    "it is thus clear that the reorganization of mesoscale network architecture is strongly tied to changes in physical properties of the mesoscale structure that occur due to the compression process .",

    "for both the normal _ ( a ) _ and tangential _ ( b ) _ networks , there is an increased correlation between the two quantities across packings . ]",
    "it is important to point out that different communities might not exist for the same number of strain steps .",
    "therefore , as a more robust measure of the relationship between community strength and stationarity , we repeat the above analysis but consider only those communities that persist throughout the entire compression cycle .",
    "if we define the _ lifetime _ of a community to be the number of steps in which it exists divided by the total number of steps in the network , then we consider the set of communities that have lifetimes equal to 1 . on average over all optimizations and experimental runs ,",
    "these long - lived communities correspond to fractions of @xmath217 for the normal force network and @xmath218 for the tangential force network .",
    "for both the normal and tangential forces , we find that the correlations between community strength and stationarity increases compared to the correlation calculated using communities with all lifetimes .",

    "( note that the horizontal  stripes \" at high values of @xmath117 correspond mostly to communities with only a few particles ; in the case of small groups , it is likely for different communities to achieve the same value of stationarity , because only so many reconfigurations are possible ) .",
    "the stronger correlations observed here may be due to the fact that they are inferred only from communities that exist for the same number of steps ( and so are more comparable to one another ) , and also from the fact that these communities have the most data over which to compute averages .",
    "physically , these longer - lived communities are also expected to undergo more continuous re - arrangements with compression , thus offering smooth estimates of stationarity ; while shorter - lived communities may experience more extensive rearrangements , leading to their birth or death , and thus may offer more variable estimates of stationarity .",
    "[ f : spearman_diff_strength_life1 ] in appendix  [ a : spearman_distributions ] shows histograms of the spearman correlations for all packings .",
    "a useful feature of our experimental setup is the presence of the low friction particles in the center of the packing . as a final demonstration of the sensitivity of the multilayer network model to the underlying physics",
    ", we examine its ability to detect differences in the physical properties of the subsystem ( low @xmath54 ) _ vs. _ the bath ( high @xmath54 ) .",
    "sensitivity to such variation is crucial to the utility of this framework .",
    "the first step is to consistently define the subsystem .",
    "the majority of subsystem particles are identified using uv dye , as described in sec .",
    "[ s : experimental_methods ] .",
    "we use the uv dye image to initially identify particles as low friction or high friction particles at each strain step .",
    "then , after having tracked particles in each frame , particles are labeled as low friction if they are identified as low friction for more than half of the steps .",
    "this technique ensures that low friction particles are not mislabeled as high friction particles , and the reverse rarely occurs .",
    "the second step is to define what constitutes a subsystem community _ vs. _ a non - subsystem community .",
    "since the communities we consider consist of more than one particle , it is highly unlikely for all particles within a group to either be only inside the subsystem radius or only outside the subsystem radius .",
    "we therefore consider a subsystem community , @xmath223 , to be a community such that more than 75% of its particles are contained within the low friction area at some point during the compression process .",
    "any community @xmath224 that does not meet this condition is considered part of the bath . to ensure a fair comparison between these two groups",
    ", we further require that the communities examined in the two groups must be of similar sizes .",
    "( due to the nature of the experimental setup , the subsystem communities are localized within a smaller region of space , and therefore will have a larger constraint on their possible sizes ) . within each optimization , we compute the average size @xmath225 of all communities across all steps in which the communities exist .",
    "we then find the largest and smallest average sizes of the subsystem communities , @xmath226 and @xmath227 , and find all bath communities that have sizes @xmath228 such that @xmath229 .",
    "this protocol mitigates the likelihood that observed differences are due to differing community sizes .     * a comparison of the physical characteristics of the subsystem and bath communities*. _ ( a , d ) _ curves showing the average community size of the subsystem ( red curve ) _ vs. _ bath ( black curve ) communities for the normal and tangential networks",
    ". the small differences between the curves for each network ensures that we compare communities of similar size between the two groups . _",
    "( b , e ) _ the evolution of community strength in the network of normal forces is not significantly different between the subsystem and bath . however ,",
    "the tangential network displays a clear separation , suggesting that the multilayer network model and community detection are sensitive to differences in friction .",
    "more importantly , the direction of the sensitivity agrees with physical intuition ; the modular structures found in the low friction bath are characterized by lower tangential intracommunity force . _",
    "( c , f ) _ there is a small distinction between the community sparsity of the two groups , with the low friction communities being slightly more dense throughout compression . ]",
    "we now proceed to investigate if and how the community strength and sparsity evolve differently for the subsystem mesostructures _ vs. _ those in the bath .",
    "we follow the procedure described in sec . [",
    "s : physical_properties ] , but here we separate the subsystem and bath communities . in fig .  [",
    "f : subsystem_comparison ] , we show the results of this analysis for both the normal _ ( a - c ) _ and tangential _ ( d - f ) _ force networks . for each of the three statistics previously considered , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 , we plot one curve for the bath ( shown in black ) and one for the subsystem ( shown in red )",
    ". panels _ ( a ) _ and _ ( d ) _ show the evolution of community size ; here we note the scale of the y - axes , which show that we are indeed comparing @xmath223 and @xmath224 of similar sizes ( the curves remain within a size difference of about 1 particle throughout all steps ) .",
    "we next examine the intra - community force of the high and low friction groups .",
    "panels _ ( b ) _ and _ ( e ) _ show the average community strengths of the subsystem and bath . for the normal force networks ,",
    "the two curves are very close ; in other words , there does not appear to be a large difference in the evolution of the intra - community normal forces between the low and high friction mesostructures .",
    "this is not a surprising result , however , as we expect the difference in friction to more significantly effect the tangential component rather than the normal component . indeed , when we consider the network of tangential forces , we are clearly able to distinguish between the architecture of the subsystem and bath . at the beginning of the compression cycle , the average strength of the low and high friction communities still follow each other closely , but after the third step , we observe that the two groups separate .",
    "in addition to the community strengths being different , the _ way _ in which they differ agrees with physical intuition ; the intra - community tangential force of the high friction particle assemblies grows significantly more than the intra - community force of the low friction particle assemblies as compression continues .",
    "we also consider the average community sparsity in order to quantify differences in the spatial arrangement of the mesostructures .",
    "we observe that @xmath168 tends to be smaller for the subsystem communities than those in the bath , although the differences are quite small .",
    "it is thus difficult to make a strong conclusion from the sparsity measure alone .",
    "the findings discussed here first indicate that our model is indeed sensitive to underlying differences in the bath and the subsystem .",
    "but perhaps more crucial are the physical conclusions about network evolution ; if only the network of normal forces is considered , it is difficult to discern the evolution of the low and high friction mesostructures . in this case",
    ", both groups display strong community organization throughout all applied strain steps .",
    "however , when the tangential force network is considered , the low friction subsystem forms noticeably weaker communities than the high friction bath , and the evolution of the two groups can be distinguished .",
    "this result suggests that the examination of _ both _ the normal and tangential force networks can lead to a more complete understanding of mesoscale structure in granular systems . in sec .",
    "[ s : discussion ] , we discuss broader implications of the findings discussed in this section .",
    "although it is thought that mesoscale structures underlie many bulk properties of granular materials , there is a pressing need to develop theoretical tools for identifying these structures and describing their dynamics .",
    "graph theoretic approaches provide a framework in which to address these challenges , via the network of contact forces connecting the grains . in this study",
    ", we use a common geometry ( biaxial compression ) as a case study for developing novel approaches drawn from network theory .",
    "we describe the evolution of the granular system by modeling it as two temporal multilayer networks ( one constructed from the normal component of the inter - particle forces , and the other from the tangential component ) .",
    "then , we extract inherent mesoscale structure from each network using multilayer community detection techniques with a physically grounded null model . unlike in a static network ,",
    "the particle assemblies we detect persist across layers , allowing a direct study of the evolution of mesoscale organization .",
    "the particle assemblies are quantified with measures of network reconfiguration , as well as with measures of physical architecture .",
    "we find that both the normal and tangential components display community structure , though the network of normal forces shows organization on a larger scale ( bigger communities ) , and exhibits less restructuring during the sequence of applied strain steps .",
    "we also demonstrate that the community architecture of the real system is significantly distinguishable from three physically - relevant null models .",
    "in addition to characterizing the evolution of the granular network in terms of force and the spatial arrangement of particle assemblies , we show that network reconfiguration can be tied to these physical descriptors .",
    "this is a crucial finding , as it bridges the gap between seemingly abstract measures of network reorganization and physical properties of network components .",
    "one result in particular that merits discussion is that particle flexibility is positively correlated with the average force on a particle across layers .",
    "although the notion that force drives local reorganization is intuitive from a physical standpoint , it is interesting to consider this result in the context of a different type of network where flexibility has also been studied .",
    "since we consider particles to be nodes and forces to be weighted edges , there is a direct analogy between the total force on particle @xmath13 in a given static network , and the _ weighted degree _ of node @xmath13 , @xmath230 in a general undirected network with adjacency matrix @xmath9 . in a study on the dynamic community structure of functional human brain networks during learning",
    ", a seemingly opposite relationship between flexibility and node strength exists @xcite .",
    "it was found that nodes from densely connected brain regions exhibited little change in community allegiance throughout learning , whereas weakly connected nodes had higher values of flexibility .",
    "this points to an interesting contrast that exists between the evolution of the granular network and the much less physically constrained functional brain network .",
    "it is reasonable to think that the source of the opposing relationship between node strength and flexibility is due to the physical nature of the granular system , and the interpretation of node strength as force , which drives reconfiguration .",
    "but perhaps more importantly , this finding motivates the general need to develop more physically informed network measures to study these mechanical systems .",
    "the use of the geographic null model ( vs. the traditional newman - girvan model ) is an important step .    in the final section ,",
    "we consider the presence of the low friction subsystem , asking _ if _ our model is sensitive to the subsystem , and more importantly , _ how_. we find that from the normal force network alone , it is difficult to distinguish the two groups .",
    "however , consideration of the tangential network shows a clear difference in the evolution of the intra - community forces of the subsystem versus the bath , with the low friction modules characterized by noticeably smaller tangential strength .",
    "these conclusions illustrate that low - friction systems can have different community organization , and that the both the normal and tangential networks contain useful information .",
    "an interesting direction for future work would be to examine the evolution of sheared systems using the multilayer network approach , where we might expect to see heightened sensitivity to differences in friction , and perhaps altered reconfiguration patterns .    it is our hope that the method and results presented in this work will inform future studies on granular materials . for example , an interesting question is whether or not measures of network reconfiguration can be related to other notions of failure and deformation , like soft spots @xcite and force chain buckling @xcite .",
    "better yet , can we _ predict _ these rearrangement events from structural features of the network before deformation ?",
    "investigation of the latter will likely require the formulation of additional physically informed statistics of network dynamics , and may moreover be complemented by machine learning techniques .",
    "the fact that the multilayer network framework is sensitive to differences in the reconfiguration of null models as well as to differences in friction , further suggests that the framework may find applicability beyond this study .",
    "one can imagine using this formulation to not only characterize the evolution of a single system , but also to distinguish , quantify , and classify dissimilarities between several systems that are slightly different .",
    "for example , compressed systems _ vs. _ sheared systems , or experiments _ vs. _ simulations .",
    "one could also use this framework to examine how varying particle shapes and sizes effect the evolution and structure of the force network at the intermediate scale , or to inform the design of materials that exhibit tailored physical properties under external perturbations . finally , the ability to identify and quantify mesoscale architecture is important in other physical systems more broadly .",
    "the brain @xcite and biomaterials @xcite are a few examples of systems where intermediate structure is crucial to function .    in order to solidify the utility of the model presented here",
    ", it will be necessary to carry out a deeper exploration of the methods .",
    "the investigation of different null models is one place to start , especially in regard to the tangential network . in this study we took the absolute value of the tangential forces in order to use the geographic null model and directly compare to the normal forces , but in different situations ( sheared systems , for example ) the _ sign _ of the force is important and should not be discarded .",
    "however , to keep this information will require a null model that can correctly deal with signed adjacency matrices without losing physical meaning . a more thorough sampling of the phase space formed by the two resolution parameters , @xmath40 and @xmath29",
    ", would also be useful",
    ". it will be interesting to consider the robustness and clarity of results with respect to changes in these quantities . additionally , it may be more physically reasonable to move away from a scalar temporal coupling and examine more complex ( but perhaps more informative ) ways of linking layers together .",
    "for example , particle properties or similarity measures between the individual static networks could be used to determine the magnitude of coupling strengths in the multilayer formulation .",
    "finally , it will be important to continue developing relevant measures of multilayer network reconfiguration that are informed by the physical questions we are attempting to answer .    in this study ,",
    "we have utilized multilayer networks to model and characterize the structural reconfiguration that occurs in a compressed granular material .",
    "the framework introduced here is sensitive to the important inhomogeneity present in granular media , and allows for the direct extraction of evolving , intermediate scale structure that has not previously been probed or examined .",
    "we conclude by noting that in addition to particulate systems , the methods developed and exercised in this work can be applied more broadly across physical , biological , technological , and social systems to understand how dynamic interactions between system components organize into collective structure , which in turn constrains bulk properties and system performance .",
