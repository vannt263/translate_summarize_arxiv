    "dwarf irregulars galaxies ( dig ) and blue compact galaxies ( bcg ) are very interesting objects to study galaxy evolution , for they are easier to model because of their generally small sizes and simple structures .",
    "their stellar populations appear to be mostly young , their metallicity is low and their gas content is large .",
    "all these features indicate that these galaxies are poorly evolved objects , and may have undergone discontinuous or gasping star formation activity .",
    "in particular , bcg are the most luminous among dwarf irregular galaxies : their very low metal content , large gas fraction and very blue colours , suggest that star formation may have proceeded in short and intense bursts of activity ( searle et al . 1978 ) .",
    "on the other hand , dig seem to show a ` gasping ' activity of star formation ( tosi et al .",
    "1992 ) . in the last few years",
    "a great deal of theoretical models for dig and bcg appeared in the literature . by means of analytical models , matteucci and chiosi ( 1983 ) first studied the effects of galactic winds on the chemical evolution of these galaxies , and suggested , among other hypotheses , that galactic winds of variable intensity could explain the observed spread in the physical properties of these galaxies . in the following years , by means of numerical models , matteucci and tosi ( 1985 ) , pilyugin ( 1992 , 1993 ) and marconi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , studied the effects of galactic winds on the chemical evolution of such galaxies and confirmed the previous results . in these papers",
    "the possibility of metal enriched winds was also considered and favoured relative to the normal galactic winds .",
    "this metal enriched wind hypothesis , in fact , allowed them to explain the observed he abundances versus metal abundances .",
    "however , none of these studies had taken into account either the energy injected by supernovae and stellar winds into the ism or the presence of dark matter halos which are of fundamental importance for the development of a galactic wind .",
    "the galactic winds were just assumed to occur every time the starburst was active .",
    "dark matter in dwarf irregular galaxies seems to be quite important as shown by recent data indicating an increasing amount of dark matter with decreasing luminosity ( skillman 1996 ) , and therefore it can not be ignored in chemical evolution models .",
    "kumai and tosa ( 1992 ) also explored the possibility of dark matter in these galaxies in a very simple way , and suggested that various amounts of dark matter could explain the observed spread in the @xmath0 relation .",
    "the energetics of supernovae and stellar winds and their interaction with the ism , is a difficult problem , still not quite understood .",
    "the only existing models of chemical evolution taking into account the stellar energetics relative to the occurrence of galactic winds , are those developed to study the chemical and photometric evolution of elliptical galaxies ( arimoto and yoshii 1987 ; matteucci and tornamb 1987 ; angeletti and giannone 1990 ; ferrini and poggianti 1994 ; bressan et al .",
    "1994 ; gibson 1994 , 1997 ) . in these models ,",
    "some specific assumptions relative to the amount of energy transferred into the ism are made .",
    "gibson ( 1994 ) has shown that the energetics from stellar winds is negligible in massive ellipticals whereas it could be important in smaller ones .",
    "for this reason it seems worthwhile to explore the effects of both supernovae and stellar winds on the evolution of dwarf irregulars and blue compact galaxies .",
    "the aim of this paper is to take into account both the stellar energetics and the presence of dark matter in modelling the chemical evolution of dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "the development of a galactic wind will therefore be calculated in detail and the existence of metal enriched or differential winds will be taken into account . by differential",
    "wind we intend a wind carrying out only some heavy elements , in particular those produced by type ii supernovae which are the predominant supernovae during a starburst ( marconi et al .",
    "1994 ) and eject material at much higher velocities than normal stellar winds . therefore",
    ", under this assumption elements such as nitrogen and helium , which are restored by low and intermediate mass stars through stellar winds , will not leave the star forming region whereas oxygen and the other @xmath1-elements , ejected during type ii supernova explosions are likely to be ejected outside the region and perhaps outside the galaxy .",
    "iron will only in part leave the star forming region since only a fraction of this element is produced by sne ii , whereas the bulk of it comes from sne ia .",
    "it should be again said that the differential wind assumption has proven to be the most viable solution to the helium problem in blue compact galaxies ( see pilyugin 1993 and marconi et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 .",
    "we will present the observational data concerning dwarf irregulars and blue compact galaxies , in section 3 . we will describe the chemical evolution model and the nucleosynthesis prescriptions , in section 4",
    ". we will give our model results and finally in section 5 .",
    "we will draw some conclusions .",
    "the data we refer to are those presented in marconi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) ( mainly pagel et al .",
    "1992 and campbell 1992 ) and in skillmann ( 1996 ) ( mainly thuan 1995 and garnett 1990 ) .",
    "thuan at al .",
    "( 1995 ) presented high quality spectrophotometric observations of 15 supergiant hii regions in 14 bcg .",
    "we compare our model results with their data relative to n , o , and fe .",
    "their data showed that none of the ratios n / o , fe / o , ne / o , ar / o , s / o , depends on the oxygen abundance indicating that abundance ratios in these galaxies show the pollution only from massive stars and that all the elements , including nitrogen , should have a primary origin ( see paragraph 3.1 ) .",
    "garnett et al . ( 1995a ) presented uv observations of 7 hii regions in low - luminosity dwarf irregular galaxies and the magellanic clouds ( hst data ) .",
    "this allowed them to measure the carbon abundances and discuss the evolution of the c / o ratio in these galaxies .",
    "they found that the c / o ratio increases continuously with increasing o / h and suggested that this can be due to the fact that in the most metal poor galaxies , massive star nucleosynthesis predominates ( oxygen production ) , while in more metallic objects the delayed contribution of intermediate mass stars to carbon is more evident .",
    "however , their comparison with chemical evolution models is not really appropriate since they have adopted , for such comparison , models relative to the solar neighbourhood , where the star formation mechanism and evolution are definitively different from those of dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "to calculate the chemical evolution of the star forming region of dig and bcg , we used an improved version of the model presented in marconi et al .",
    "the main features of our chemical evolution model are the following :    1 .   one - zone , with instantaneous and complete mixing of gas inside this zone ; 2 .   no instantaneous recycling approximation , i.e. the stellar lifetimes are taken into account ; 3 .",
    "the evolution of several chemical elements ( he , c , n , o , fe ) due to stellar nucleosynthesis , stellar mass ejection , galactic wind powered by supernovae and stellar wind and infall of primordial gas , is followed in details .    if @xmath2 is the fractional mass of the element _ i _ in the gas , its evolution is given by the equations : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gas mass in the form of an element _ i _ normalized to a total luminous mass @xmath5 . + the quantity @xmath6 represents the abundance by mass of an element _ i _ and by definition the summation over all the elements present in the gas mixture is equal to unity .",
    "the quantity @xmath7 is the total fractional mass of gas .",
    "the star formation rate we assume during a burst , @xmath8 , is defined as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the star formation efficiency ( expressed in units of @xmath11 ) , and represents the inverse of the timescale of star formation , namely the timescale necessary to consume all the gas in the star forming region .",
    "more precisely , @xmath10 can be expressed as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the real star formation efficiency , and @xmath14 is a parameter taking into account the stochastic nature of the star formation processes ( gerola et al .",
    "1980 ) as shown in matteucci and chiosi ( 1983 ) , where a detailed description can be found .",
    "the rate of gas loss via galactic winds for each element is assumed to be simply proportional to the amount of gas present at the time @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the abundance of the element _ i _ in the wind and in the interstellar medium ( ism ) ; @xmath18 is a free parameter describing the efficiency of the galactic wind and expressed in @xmath11 .",
    "we have considered normal and differential winds : in the first case , all the elements are lost at the same efficiency ( @xmath19 ) . in the second case , the value of @xmath18 has been assumed to be different for different elements : in particular , the assumption has been made that only the elements produced by type ii sne ( mostly @xmath1-elements and one third of the iron ) can escape the star forming region .",
    "we have made this choice following the conclusions of marconi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who showed that models with differential winds can better explain the observational constraints of blue compact galaxies in general .",
    "the conditions for the onset of the galactic wind are studied in detail and described in paragraph @xmath20 .",
    "the chemical evolution equations include also an accretion term : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the abundance of the element _ i _ in the infalling gas , assumed to be primordial , @xmath23 is the time scale of mass accretion @xmath24 is the galactic lifetime , and @xmath25 is a constant obtained by imposing to reproduce @xmath26 at the present time @xmath24 . the parameter @xmath23 has been assumed to be the same for all dwarf irregulars and short enough to avoid unlikely high infall rates at the present time ( @xmath27 years ) .    finally , the initial mass function ( imf ) by mass , @xmath28 , is expressed as a power law : @xmath29 we considered two cases for the imf :    1 .   the exponent @xmath30 over the mass range @xmath31 ( salpeter 1955 imf ) , and 2 .",
    "@xmath30 over the mass range @xmath32 , and @xmath33 over the mass range @xmath34 ( scalo 1986 imf ) .",
    "@xmath35 is the normalisation constant , obtained with the following condition : @xmath36      the @xmath37 term of the equation ( 1 ) represents the stellar contribution to the enrichment of the ism , i.e. the rate at which the element _ i _ is restored into the ism from a stellar generation ( see marconi et al .",
    "this term contain all the nucleosynthesis prescriptions :    1 .   for low and intermediate mass stars ( @xmath38 )",
    "we have used renzini and voli s ( 1981 ) nucleosynthesis calculations for a value of the mass loss parameter @xmath39 ( reimers 1975 ) , and the mixing length @xmath40 .",
    "the standard value for @xmath41 is 8 @xmath42 ; 2 .   for massive stars ( @xmath43 )",
    "we have used woosley s ( 1987 ) nucleosynthesis computations but adopting the relationship between the initial mass @xmath44 and the he - core mass @xmath45 , from maeder ( 1989 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the adopted @xmath46 ) relationship does not substantially differ from the original relationship given by arnett ( 1978 ) and from the new one by maeder ( 1992 ) based on models with overshooting and @xmath47 .",
    "these new models show instead a very different behaviour of @xmath46 ) for stars more massive than 25 @xmath42 and @xmath48 , but our galaxies never reach such a high metallicity ; 3 .   for the explosive nucleosynthesis products ,",
    "we have adopted the prescriptions by nomoto et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and thielmann et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , model w7 , for type ia sne , which we assume to originate from c - o white dwarfs in binary systems ( see again marconi et al .",
    "1994 for details ) .    as already said",
    ", nitrogen is a key element to understand the evolution of galaxies with few star forming events since it needs relatively long timescales as well as a relatively high underlying metallicity to be produced .",
    "the reason is that n is believed to be mostly a secondary element ( secondary elements are those synthesized from metals originally present in the star and not produced _ in situ _ , while primary elements are those synthesized directly from h and he ) .",
    "in fact , n is secondary in massive stars , and mostly secondary and probably partly primary in low and intermediate mass stars ( renzini and voli 1981 ) .",
    "however , some doubts exist at the moment on the amount of primary nitrogen which can be produced in intermediate mass stars due to the uncertanties related to the occurrence of the third _ dredge - up _ in asymptotic giant branch stars ( agb ) .",
    "in fact , if blcker and schoenberner ( 1991 ) calculations are correct , the third _ dredge - up _ in massive agb stars should not occur and therefore the amount of primary n produced in agb stars should be strongly reduced ( renzini , private communication ) .    as a consequence ,",
    "the only way left to produce a reasonable quantity of n during a short burst ( no longer than 20 @xmath49 ) is to require that massive stars produce a substantial amount of primary nitrogen .",
    "this claim was already made by matteucci ( 1987 ) in order to explain the [ n / o ] abundances in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "recently , woosley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have shown that massive stars can indeed produce primary nitrogen , and marconi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and kunth et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have taken into account this possibility . in this paper",
    "we also have considered this possibility and , since the woosley et al .",
    "data are not yet available we have used the same parametrization adopted by marconi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and kunth et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "our model presents a new formulation of galactic winds relative to previous published models of this type ( matteucci and tosi 1985 and marconi et al .",
    "in particular , we adopted the prescriptions developed for elliptical galaxies ( matteucci and tornamb 1987 ; gibson 1994 , 1997 ) : galaxies develop galactic winds when the gas thermal energy @xmath50 , exceeds its binding energy @xmath51 , i.e. when : @xmath52    a detailed treatment of the energetics of the ism is considered , in order to compute the gas thermal energy : @xmath53 we calculated the energy fraction deposited in the gas by stellar winds from massive stars @xmath54 , and by supernova explosions @xmath55 . here the supernova contribution is given by : @xmath56 where : @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the rates of supernova ( ii and ia ) explosion , @xmath28 is the imf and @xmath8 is the star formation rate .",
    "the type ia and ii sn rates are calculated according to matteucci and greggio ( 1986 ) .",
    "the energy injected and effectively thermalized into the ism from supernova explosions ( @xmath62 ) and stellar winds from massive stars ( @xmath63 ) , are given by the following formulas : @xmath64 @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the total energy released by a supernova explosion , @xmath67 is the energy injected into the ism by a typical massive star through stellar winds during all its lifetime , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the efficiencies of energy transfer from supernova and stellar winds into the ism , respectively .",
    "we adopted a formulation for @xmath62 and @xmath70 which is described in detail in appendix .",
    "our formulation refers to an ideal case characterized by an uniform ism , and no interaction with other supernova explosions or interstellar clouds .",
    "when a supernova explodes the stellar material is violently ejected into the ism and its expansion is gradually slowed down by the ism . the energy released by the supernova explosion",
    "is assumed to be @xmath71 , while the energy effectively transferred and thermalized into the ism is given by eq .",
    "( 13 ) and depends on the assumed value for @xmath68 .",
    "the main parameters used to derive @xmath68 , as described in the appendix , are : the initial blast wave energy @xmath72 , the interstellar gas density @xmath73 , and the isothermal sound speed in the ism @xmath74 .",
    "for typical values of these parameters @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 we obtained the following range of possible values for @xmath68 : @xmath78 in particular , we have adopted an intermediate value of @xmath79 which we assume to be the typical sn energy transfer efficiency .",
    "the energy injected into the ism by a typical massive star through stellar winds during all her lifetime is estimated to be : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the time the star spends in main sequence and @xmath82 is the stellar wind luminosity . by using the arguments developed in the appendix",

    "the introduction of dark matter halos with variable amounts and concentrations of dark matter is considered when we compute the binding energy of interstellar gas , @xmath51 : @xmath91 the two terms on the right of the equation take in account the gravitational interaction between the gas mass @xmath92 , and the total luminous mass of the galaxy @xmath93 , and between the gas mass and the dark matter @xmath94 : @xmath95 @xmath96 where @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "+ @xmath98 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath99 is the ratio between the effective radius of luminous matter and the effective radius of dark matter .",
    "these equations are taken from bertin et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and are valid for @xmath100 defined in the range @xmath101 . + it is worth noting that the original formulation of bertin et al .",
    "( 1992 ) was thought for massive elliptical galaxies , and that it is not necessarily the right one for dwarf irregulars .",
    "however , we used such a formulation since theoretical formulations for the binding energy of dwarf irregulars are not available .",
    "our study of the evolution of bcg and dig starts from the results obtained by marconi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) : _ i ) _ the star formation is assumed to proceed in short and intense bursts of activity , which may induce galactic winds ; _ ii ) _ metal enriched and normal winds have been considered . in particular , for the metal enriched winds the assumption is made that galactic winds carry mostly the nucleosynthesis products of supernovae of type ii , with the consequence of removing elements such as oxygen but not elements such as helium and nitrogen which are mainly produced in low and intermediate mass stars , and ejected through stellar winds .",
    "the novelty is that _",
    "i ) _ galactic winds are powered both by supernova explosions ( snii and snia ) and stellar winds from massive stars , and that _ ii ) _ we consider the presence of dark matter halos in these galaxies .    in order to understand the observed distribution of n / o ,",
    "c / o _ versus _ o / h , and of [ o / fe ] _ versus _ [ fe / h ] , we computed different galaxy models by varying some parameters such as the number of bursts , the duration of each burst , the star formation efficiency , the galactic wind efficiency , the dark matter mass and distribution , and finally , the imf exponent .",
    "we first considered three sets of _ standard models _ characterized by 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 and 10 bursts of a duration of 20 , 60 and 100 @xmath49 , whereas the other parameters were fixed by the results presented in marconi et al .",
    "in particular , the imf is the salpeter one , and the star formation efficiency is @xmath102 .",
    "the galactic wind is differential , namely @xmath18 is different from zero only for the @xmath1-elements ejected through type ii supernova explosions . in particular , for the elements studied here ,",
    "@xmath103 is zero for n and he , whereas it is @xmath104 for o , ne , na , mg and si , is @xmath105 for c , since carbon is partly produced and ejected by low and intermediate mass stars through stellar winds , and is @xmath106 for fe since only @xmath107 of this element is produced by sne ii .",
    "the ratio between dark and luminous matter is assumed to be 10 and that between the luminous and dark core radius is @xmath108 for the three sets of standard models .",
    "normal galactic winds instead require @xmath109 to be the same for all the chemical elements . from now on we will indicate the models with differential winds by a capital @xmath110 , ( e.g. @xmath111 indicating the value for the @xmath1-elements ) .    among our standard models , those with burst duration @xmath112 never developed galactic winds , and those with @xmath113 predicted the destruction of the galaxy ( i.e. when the thermal energy of gas is larger than the binding energy of the galaxy ) when a large number of bursts was assumed ( in particular when @xmath114 ) ; on the contrary models with @xmath115 never predicted galaxy destruction and developed galactic winds for @xmath116 . as a consequence of this , we chose to examine only models with @xmath115 .",
    "we started then from our standard models and varied several parameters such as the star formation efficiency , the wind efficiency , the amount and distribution of dark matter .",
    "we found that in order to reproduce the observed spread of @xmath117 and @xmath118 and @xmath119\\,\\ , versus \\,\\ ,   [ fe / h]$ ] , the most important parameter is the star formation efficiency .",
    "we computed two series of models characterized by two different imf : the salpeter ( 1955 ) and the scalo ( 1986 ) function . to reproduce the observed spread in all three diagrams , we needed a star formation efficiency ( @xmath10 ) between 0.1 and 7 @xmath11 when using the salpeter imf , and between 1 and 10 @xmath120 when using the scalo imf .",
    "the best value for the wind parameter was @xmath121 .",
    "consider first the salpeter imf case : we computed models with 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 and 7 bursts , and tested the importance of the presence of the dark matter .",
    "greater is the amount of dark matter , deeper is the galaxy potential and higher the gas binding energy .",
    "therefore , the thermal energy required to develop the galactic wind has also to be higher .",
    "we found that if the amount of dark matter is the same as that of the luminous matter ( @xmath122 ) any model predicts galaxy destruction during the first starburst if the star formation efficiency is high ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "this upper limit of @xmath10 depends of course on the number of bursts : models with many bursts , are characterized by a great consume of gas through star formation activity , so they must have lower star formation rates to keep bound , than models with just one or two bursts .",
    "we previously said that we need @xmath124 to explain the observed spread of the abundances ratios .",
    "so , let s consider the presence of a greater amount of dark matter : ten times the luminous matter ( @xmath125 ) . in this case none of the models characterized by 1 or 2 bursts and",

    "in this paper we attempted to model the chemical evolution of dwarf irregulars and blue compact galaxies .",
    "in particular , we considered the presence of dark matter halos and of the different contributions to the interstellar gas energy due to supernovae ( ii and ia ) and stellar winds from massive stars . the comparison with the available data on the abundances and abundance ratios of elements such as he , n , c , o , and fe allowed us to conclude that dig and bcg must contain a substantial amount of dark matter in order to be gravitationally bound against the intense starbursts , that galactic winds powered by supernovae and stellar winds from massive stars are preferably enriched ( differential ) , and that the energy contribution from type ia supernovae to the total thermal energy of the gas is negligible relative to the type ii supernova component .",
    "we found also that the stellar wind contribution is negligible relative to that of the type ii supernovae .      * a number of bursts @xmath134 ; * a star formation efficiency @xmath135 ; * differential galactic winds mostly powered by supernovae of type ii , with a wind efficiency parameter @xmath136 ; * a ratio between dark matter and luminous matter @xmath137 ; * a dark matter distribution given by the ratio between luminous effective radius and dark effective radius @xmath138 ; * salpeter imf is favoured relative to scalo imf : in fact the observed abundance ratios are better reproduced by salpeter models than by scalo models , in particular the spread of n / o abundance ratio .      in order to calculate the energy gained by the ism after an isolated sn explosion we consider the expansion of the snr through an uniform medium of number density @xmath139 and isothermal sound speed @xmath140 cm s@xmath141 .",
    "initially the temperature of the remnant is very high and the energy radiated away is negligible as compared to the explosion energy @xmath142 ; this phase is called ` adiabatic ' and is described by the sedov solution , @xmath143 . as the remnant expands its temperature decreases and eventually the radiative losses from the swept - up dense shell become relevant at the cooling time given by ( cf .",
    "cioffi & shull 1991 ) :      for @xmath147 most of the mass and the kinetic energy of the snr is contained by the thin , cold , massive expanding shell , while the interior cavity is filled with hot dilute gas that contains most of the thermal energy . at this stage",
    "the hot bubble has a very long cooling time and cools adiabatically as it expands pushing the outer shell .",
    "we thus assume that its thermal energy varies as @xmath148 and neglect a correction @xmath149 due to the effect of cooling ( cioffi , mckee & bertschinger , 1988 ) .",
    "this is compatible with the other simplifying assumptions made in our evaluation of the sn efficiency .",
    "the remnant therefore expands as @xmath150 in this ` snow plow ' phase . at a later time",
    "the pressure inside the cavity becomes equal to the external pressure and the remnant stalls .",
    "we define the stalling radius as the radius at which the shell velocity is equal to @xmath151 .",
    "as long as the snr expands supersonically , the ism outside the remnant is not aware of its presence and the fraction of the sn explosion energy which is not cooled off remains locked inside the cavity . at merger , the shell dissipates its remaining kinetic energy and its thermal energy ( we assume that the shell temperature does not become lower than the temperature of the unperturbed ism , so that its thermal energy is three times the kinetic energy at the stalling radius ) which add to the thermal content of the ism .",
    "the efficiency is thus given by the ratio of this shell energy to the explosion energy . with the assumptions above it is found :    @xmath152 it may happen that the remnant pressure becomes lower than the external pressure before the merger . in this case",
    "the remnant enters in the ` momentum conserving ' phase , @xmath153 .",
    "spitzer ( 1968 ) has shown that , in the limiting case in which the ` snow plow ' phase is entirely skipped and the ` momentum conserving ' phase starts just after @xmath154 , the efficiency is given by @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the remnant velocity at @xmath154 . in our notations",
    "we get :    @xmath157 thus , the ` true ' efficiency will be intermediate between the two above .",

    "the above efficiency represents an upper limit ; in fact , ` momentum conserving ' bubbles ( @xmath170 ) may be realized if a substantial enhancement of radiative losses occurs for some reason such as cloudy medium ( mckee et al .",
    "1984 ) or non steady cooling ( e.g. dercole 1992 ) . in this case",
    "the hot gas quickly cools and the shell is pushed by the ram pressure of the wind that impinges directly on it .",
    "the efficiency then becomes :        we finally point out that in principle the sn efficiency worked out above could not be valid for exploding stars more massive than 20 @xmath161 because the remnant interacts with the bubble rather than with the uniform ism .",
    "if however we consider 20 @xmath161 as representative of massive stars ( @xmath174 , then the maximum bubble radius is rather small ( @xmath175 pc ) , shorter of the radius where the snr becomes radiative ( @xmath176 pc ) and much shorter than the radius at which it stalls ( @xmath177 pc ) .",
    "if , moreover , heat conduction is active , the bubble tends to be replenished during the red supergiant phase of the star ( dercole 1992 ) .",
    "we thus consider the above estimate of @xmath178 rather accurate for our purposes ."
