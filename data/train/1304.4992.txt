    "weak gravitational lensing has now became a unique and practical tool to probe dark matter distribution irrespective of its relation to luminous objects , thanks to great progress in technique for weak lensing analysis as well as in a wide field imaging instrument ( for reviews see mellier 1999 ; bartelmann & schneider 2001 ; refregier 2003 ; hoekstra & jain 2008 ; munshi et al .",
    "measuring the statistics of weak lensing shear , also known as the cosmic shear statistics , has been recognized as one of most powerful probes of cosmological parameters and is employed as the primary science application by many on - going / future wide field survey projects ( e.g. , the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) ; dark energy survey ( des ) ; hyper suprimecam survey ; the kilo - degree survey ( kids ) ; the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) ; wide field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) ; euclid mission ) .",
    "it should be , however , noted that the full potential of cosmic shear statistics to place a constraint on the cosmological parameters is archived only if systematic errors are reduced down to a required level ( huterer et al .",
    "2006 ; cropper et al .",
    "2013 ; massey et al .",
    "2013 ) .    in the process of weak lensing analysis ,",
    "the correction for the point spread function ( psf ) is of fundamental importance , because it has two serious effects on any galaxy shape measurement : one is the circularization of the images , which systematically lowers the lensing shear .",
    "the other is a coherent deformation of the images caused by anisotropy of the psf , which may mimic a weak lensing shear .",
    "much effort has been made to develop techniques and software to correct the psf effects , and the weak lensing community has conducted blind tests using mock data to evaluate their performance ( heymans et al . 2006a ; massey et al . 2007 ; bridle et al .",
    "2010 ; kitching et al . 2012a , b ; and references therein ) .",
    "most of the software is designed to correct the psf , regardless of its origins .",
    "major sources of psf , recognized so far , except for diffraction , include the atmospheric turbulence , optical aberration , the misalignment of ccd chips on a focal plane and pixelization .",
    "an alternative and complementary approach to this issue is to investigate the properties of the psf for a specific instrument , while focusing on a specific cause(s ) , which may help to optimize the psf correction scheme and to understand a level of residual systematics ( hoekstra 2004 ; jarvis & jain 2004 ; wittman 2005 ; jarvis , schechter & jain 2008 ; jee et al . 2007 ; 2011 ; rhodes et al .",
    "2007 ; jee & tyson 2011 ; heymans et al 2012 ; chang et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the latter approach is exactly what we consider in the present paper .",
    "the purpose of this study is twofold : first , we look at the properties of anisotropic psfs of the subaru prime focus camera ( suprime - cam , miyazaki et al . 2002 ) .",
    "we pay a special attention to evaluating the amplitude and spatial correlation of psf anisotropies caused by different sources .",
    "to do this , we used a set of dense star field images from which we can sample the psf densely , enabling us to investigate the spatial variation of the psf in detail .",
    "second , using mock simulation data of psfs , we examined how well the psf anisotropy can be corrected using the standard psf correction scheme .",
    "the motivation of this study concerns the existence of a non - zero b - mode in the cosmic shear correlation functions measured from suprime - cam data .",
    "the measurement was made by hamana et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , they analyzed a 2 degree@xmath0 data and found statistically significant b - mode correlations ( see  [ sec : scambmode ] for an updated but similar result ) .",
    "since the b - mode shear is not produced by gravitational lensing in the standard gravity theory at the lowest order of the perturbative treatment , its existence indicates any non - lensing process(es ) taking place .",
    "the origin(s ) of the b - mode was unclear ; it could be simply due to remaining systematics in the data reduction and analysis .",
    "also it may arise from an intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes ( e.g. , croft & metzler 2000 ; catelan , kamionkowski & blandford 2001 ; crittenden et al .",
    "2002 ; jing 2002 ; hirata & seljak 2004 ; heymans et al .",
    "more importantly , the b - mode may be produced by a non - standard gravity ( e.g. , yamauchi , namikawa & taruya 2012 ; 2013 ) .",
    "thus the b - mode shear , in principle , provides us with valuable information on the gravity theory .",
    "it is thus important to first understand the level of residual systematic in the data analysis ( see , for a similar approach , hoekstra 2004 ; van waerbeke , mellier & hoekstra 2005 ) .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows ; in section 2 , data reduction and psf measurements of dense star field data are described .",
    "the amplitude and spatial correlation of psf anisotropies caused by different sources are evaluated separately in section 3 .",
    "the psf correction scheme adopted in our cosmic shear analysis is tested against the mock simulation data in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we assess the impact of the residual psf anisotropy on the cosmic shear analysis .",
    "finally , a summary and discussion are given in section 6 .",
    "in appendices , we summarize the properties of psf ellipticities caused by third - order optical aberrations ( appendix 1 ) , and describe a numerical study of psf ellipticities caused by atmospheric turbulence ( appendix 2 ) .",
    "we used @xmath1-band data of a dense stellar field taken with the suprime - cam on 2002/9/30 , 2003/6/30 and 2003/7/1 .",
    "the field is located at the galactic coordinate of @xmath2 .",
    "we collected 289 shots of 60 seconds exposure and 70 shots of 30 seconds exposure from the data archive smoka .",
    "the seeing fwhms of those data range from 0.46to 0.88with a median of 0.63 .",
    "each ccd data was reduced using the sdfred software ( yagi et al . 2002 ; ouchi et al .",
    "note that we conservatively used data only within 15 arcmin radius from the field center of suprime - cam , because at the outside of that , the point spread function ( psf ) becomes elongated significantly , which may make the correction for the psf inaccurate .",
    "then , mosaicking of 10 ccds was performed with scamp ( bertin 2006 ) and swarp ( bertin et al .  2002 ) .",
    "in addition to the individual exposure images , we also generated stacked images using swarp .",
    "note that the images obtained during a same night were taken with the same pointing ( thus no dithering was made ) .",
    "since differences in pointings of images taken on different nights are very small ( less than the gaps between ccds ) , no data from different ccds was added .",
    "object detections were performed with sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) and _ hfindpeaks _ of imcat software ( kaiser , squires & broadhurst 1995 ) , and two catalogs were merged by matching positions with a tolerance of 1  arcsec . from the image of stars , we measured an anisotropy of the psf .",
    "we use the following ellipticity estimator ( exactly speaking the polarization , see kaiser et al .",
    "1995 ) to characterize the anisotropy of psfs : @xmath3 @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the surface brightness of an object and @xmath6 is the gaussian window function .",
    "getshapes _ of imcat for the actual computation of these quantities .    from catalogs of detected objects ( almost all of them are stars )",
    ", we generated two kinds of sub - catalogs by mimicking weak lensing analysis : one is a `` star - role '' catalog which contains 700 ( the number density of 1 arcmin@xmath7 ) of the highest sn non - saturated stars .",
    "the other is a `` galaxy - role '' catalog which contains 30,000 ( 42 arcmin@xmath7 ) of the next highest sn non - saturated stars .",
    "the minimum flux sns for star - role and galaxy - role catalogs are sufficiently high ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "an anisotropy of psf results from several sources including the atmospheric turbulence , the optical aberration , the misalignment of ccd chips on a focal plane , the pixelization , and tracking error of the telescope .",
    "our attempt in this section is to examine the psf on a source - by - source basis using physically motivated models .",
    "we evaluate the statistical properties of psf anisotropies using a two - point correlation function related estimator , called the e- and b - mode aperture mass variances defined by ( schneider et al .",
    "1998 ; we follow the notation by schneider , van waerbeke & mellier 2002 ) @xmath10,\\ ] ] and @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are defined in schneider et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the two - point correlation functions of the ellipticities computed by @xmath16 in the above expressions , the summation is taken over all pairs of objects with a distance within a width of a bin considered @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the number of pairs in the bin , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the tangential and @xmath21 rotated ellipticity components in the frame defined by the line connecting a pair of objects .",
    "some authors adopt @xmath22 instead of @xmath23 as an estimator of the spatial correlation of psf ellipticities and its residual , which remains after the correction ( jee & tyson 2011 ; chang et al 2012 ; 2013 ) .",
    "the reason for our choice of @xmath24 is as follows . in the case of an ellipticity field with power spectrum with a spectrum index more negative than @xmath25",
    "( this is exactly our case as will be shown in subsequent subsections ) , @xmath26 becomes almost flat shape , because the amplitude of not only the large - scale , but also the small - scale correlation function , is dominated by the power on larger scales .",
    "also , even if only the larger scale psf ellipticy correlation is corrected , not only the large - scale but also the small - scale amplitude decreases . therefore @xmath22 is not suited for quantifying the spatial correlation of our psf ellipticity data . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath24 is a kind of bandpass filtered variance , thus it is more suitable estimator for our current purpose .",
    "although psf ellipticities arise from several causes and vary temporally , there is a visibly identifiable component that most likely results from optical aberrations . in the top - left panel of figure [ fig : esp_emap1 ] and [ fig : esp_emap2 ] , we show two examples of _ whisker plots _ of psf ellipticities where characteristic features of optical aberration can be clearly observed : we also show one case in figure [ fig : esp_emap3 ] where an optical aberration is almost invisible .",
    "we fit the spatial variation of psfs with the following fitting function of the optical psf ellipticities , which is motivated from the lowest - order optical aberration theory ( see appendix [ appendix : aberration ] for details ) , @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we determine the model parameters @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 by the standard least - square method with observed psf ellipticities .",
    "this model consists of the axis - symmetric , asymmetric and constant components , which are displayed in the bottom - left panel , bottom - right panel , and top - right corner of top - panels , respectively .",
    "note that in the top - left panel , the psf ellipticities measured from `` star - role '' stars , but after the constant component being subtracted , are plotted .",
    "it is clearly seen from figure [ fig : esp_emap1 ] and [ fig : esp_emap2 ] that the simple three - component model can well reproduce the observed psfs .",
    "it may therefore be said that the optical aberration is one major origin of the psf anisotropy .",
    "note that a cause(s ) of the constant component is uncertain .",
    "it arises not only from an optical aberration ( the misalignment coma , see appendix [ appendix : aberration ] ) but also from , e.g. , a tracking error . since the constant ellipticity component does not contribute to the aperture mass variances , we do not consider it in the following discussion .    , [ fig : esp_emap2 ] and [ fig : esp_emap3 ] are marked with an open circle , open square and open triangle , respectively .",
    "dotted boxes define groups used for statistical analyses .",
    "[ fig : gamt_prof],width=302 ]    having found that the optical aberration is one major source of the psf ellipticities and can be well modeled with one constant and two spatially variable components , we introduce estimators that quantify the amplitude of the symmetric and asymmetric components : @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where the rms scatter @xmath35 is computed from the model ellipticities of 700 star - role psfs for each exposure , and `` sign '' in @xmath36 is @xmath37 or @xmath38 for the tangentially ( the mean tangential ellipticity has the plus sign ) or radially elongated cases , respectively .",
    "the results for all exposures are plotted in figure [ fig : gamt_prof ] .",
    "it can be observed from the figure that there is a `` v - shaped '' trend between strengths of the symmetric component and asymmetric component . in the lowest - order aberration theory ,",
    "the symmetric aberration is caused by a shift in the focal plane position from an ideal position , whereas the asymmetric one is caused by the decenter and/or tilt between the axes of the focal plane and the corrector ( lenses ) .",
    "the result indicates that those two deviations happen in a mutually related manner . in figure",
    "[ fig : gamt_prof ] one may find that there are some exposures that are located somewhat outside of the `` v - shaped '' trend .",
    "it is speculated from a visual inspection that the aberration model fitting of those cases is affected due to the atmospheric psf . in our model fitting procedure ,",
    "such contamination is unavoidable .",
    "this issue should be noticed when one uses the model fitting for evaluating the optical psf component from observed psf ellipticities .    , and the plotted aperture mass variances are average values taken over all exposures in each group .",
    "[ fig : mapvar_groups],width=302 ]    next we examine the statistical properties of the psf ellipticities using the aperture mass variance , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mape ] ) and ( [ eq : mapb ] ) while especially focusing on contribution from the optical aberration . to do so , we classified data using @xmath36 and @xmath39 into 9 groups as shown in figure [ fig : gamt_prof ] .",
    "we computed the average aperture mass variances for each group , and show the results in figure [ fig : mapvar_groups ] .",
    "the left panels of the figure show the results based on the observed data , from which it is found that the e - mode variance has a larger amplitude on larger scales , whereas in most cases b - mode variance is smaller than the e - mode especially on larger scales . if we assume a power - law spectrum for ellipticity power spectrum where @xmath40 is the aperture function .",
    "thus @xmath41 for a power - law power spectrum of @xmath42 . ]",
    "@xmath42 , the measured e - mode variance indicates that @xmath43 .",
    "the right panels of figure [ fig : mapvar_groups ] show the aperture mass variances computed from psf ellipticities of the optical aberration model . comparing those with observed variance , plotted in the left panels",
    ", we can estimate the amount of the contribution from the optical aberration to the psf ellipticity .",
    "we first look at the e - mode .",
    "it follows from the comparison between the aperture mass variance measured from the observed ellipticities and the model ( the left and right panels figure [ fig : mapvar_groups ] ) that for large aberration cases such like g1 - 3 , g8 and g9 , the model variance accounts for most of the observed one , indicating that the optical aberration is the dominant component of the psf ellipticities , as expected from the visual impression ( figs .",
    "[ fig : esp_emap1 ] and [ fig : esp_emap2 ] ) . for small aberration cases ( g4-g7 )",
    ", one may see the aperture mass variances of the model are slightly smaller than the observed ones . in the following subsections , we argue that the residual variances mostly arise from atmospheric turbulence and chip misalignment .",
    "let s turn to the b - mode .",
    "it follows from a comparison between the left and right panels that the variances measured from the model are smaller than the observed ones except for g1 .",
    "this also suggests the existence of other components than the optical component .",
    "next , we examine the psf ellipticities remaining after subtracting the optical aberration component .",
    "let us start with a visual impression . in figures [ fig : emap1 ] and",
    "[ fig : emap2 ] , the psf ellipticities of the observed data ( left ) , the optical aberration model ( center ) , and the residual of those two ( @xmath44 ) are plotted .",
    "note that the mosaicked data consists of 2-row@xmath455-column ccd chips with a masked outer region ( beyond 15 arcmin radius from the field center ) . in those residual plots , there are two apparent features that should be noticed : one is discontinuities between chips , and the other is ripple - like patterns .",
    "the latter is a characteristic feature of psf ellipticites caused by atmospheric turbulence which was also observed in cfht data ( heymans et al . 2012 ) , and was also found in numerical simulations ( jee & tyson 20011 ; chang et al . 2012 ; 2013 ; also see appendix [ appendix : atmos ] ) , which we examine in detail in the next subsection [ sec : atmospheric ] .    in this subsection",
    ", we focus on psf ellipticities caused by misalignment of ccd chips .",
    "to do so , we first need to create data that are minimally affected by the optical aberration and atmospheric turbulence .",
    "the former could be minimized by using data with small values of both @xmath46 and @xmath39 .",
    "the latter could be suppressed by stacking many images as the amplitude of the atmospheric psf decreases , with the exposure time being @xmath47 ( de vries et al 2007 ; chang et al .",
    "2012 ; heymans et al .",
    "2012 ; see also appendix [ appendix : atmos ] ) .",
    "thus we generate a coadded image of 52 shots of 60-second exposures taken from the g5 group where the effect of the optical aberration is at a minimum level and the largest number of shots ( 52 shots ) is contained .",
    "the stacking was done using swarp , and the object detection and ellipticity measurement were performed in the same manner as that described in section [ sec : data ] .    .",
    "the solid line is for the observed psfs , dashed line is for the aberration model , the dotted line is for the residual of those two ( @xmath44 ) and the long - dashed for chip - misalignment psf model . [",
    "fig : mapvar_chip],width=302 ]    the psf ellipticities of the coadded data are shown in figure [ fig : emap ] .",
    "one can see psf discontinuities between the chips even in the observed psf ( top - left panel ) as well as in the residual psfs ( top - right panel ) .",
    "we attempt to extract the chip - misalignment component from the residual psf ellipticities by fitting the residual psfs with the 2nd order bi - polynomial function on the chip - by - chip basis .",
    "the derived psf models are shown in the bottom - right panel of figure [ fig : emap ] in which it can be seen that characteristic features of chip - misalignment psf ellipticities ( such as discontinuities between the chips and the chip - scale smooth variation ) are well reproduced by the model .",
    "we measured the aperture mass variances of the psf ellipticities ( show in figure [ fig : mapvar_chip ] ) .",
    "note that the b - mode variances are too small to properly analyze , and thus we do not present them .",
    "although our model may not extract only the chip - misalignment psfs , but may be affected by other sources of psf ellipticity , it may still be reasonable to consider that the model allows us to assess an approximate amplitude of the chip - misalignment psf ellipticies .",
    "we read from the figure [ fig : mapvar_chip ] that the amplitude of the chip - misalignment psf ellipticies is roughly @xmath48 .",
    "it should , however , be noted that the chip - misalignment psf is a phenomenon related to the optical aberration , and thus its amplitude may vary with deviation in the focal plane position . therefore the above value should be considered as a characteristic size .",
    "it is also found from figure [ fig : mapvar_chip ] that the aperture mass variance of the residual psfs ( @xmath49 ) is slightly larger than that of the chip - misalignment psf model .",
    "the amplitude of the excess is roughly @xmath50 .",
    "the origin of this excess is not clear , though it could be due to some imperfection in the models , and/or due to atmospheric psfs , and/or due to other causes such as pixelization effects caused in a process of resampling ( hamana & miyazaki 2008 ) .",
    "if the latter is the case , it can be settled by recently developed shape measurements schemes that do not involve a resampling process ( e.g. , miller et al . 2007 ; 2013 ; and miyatake et al 2013 ) .",
    "thus we leave it for future work .      ,",
    "width=332 ]     arcmin as a function of the exposure time .",
    "circles and triangles are for e- and b - mode , respectively .",
    "the expected exposure time dependence of @xmath51 ( plotted by the solid line ) is clearly seen .",
    "[ fig : mapvar_texp],width=302 ]    let us turn to the psf ellipticity arising from atmospheric turbulence .",
    "the properties of the atmospheric psf ellipticity has been examined experimentally ( wittman 2005 ; heymans et al . 2012 ) or using numerical simulations ( de vries et al 2007 ; jee & tyson 20011 ; chang et al . 2012 ; 2013 ) .",
    "a major characteristic of the atmospheric psf ellipticity found from previous studies is that the amplitude of psf ellipticities decreases with the exposure time as @xmath47 ( de vries et al 2007 ; chang et al .",
    "2012 ; heymans et al . 2012 ) .",
    "also , the shape of the power spectrum and aperture mass variance of the atmospheric psf ellipticities was investigated numerically ( see appendix [ appendix : atmos ] ) .",
    "we investigate the atmospheric psfs using data from the g5 group . in top - panels of figure",
    "[ fig : mapvar_diff ] , we show the aperture mass variances for different exposure times ; from top to bottom , single 30-second , 60-second exposures , coadded 4@xmath4560 , 13@xmath4560 and 52@xmath4560-second exposures . as is shown in the plots , the amplitude of the aperture mass variance decreases as the exposure time increases .",
    "however the minimum amplitude of the e - mode is set by the optical aberration psfs and chip - misalignment psfs , as shown in the last two subsections , whereas the b - mode variance decreases down to @xmath52 .",
    "this indicates that the optical and chip - misalignment psf largely contribute to the e - mode psf ellipticity .    in order to evaluate the amplitude of the atmospheric psf ellipticities separately from other components ,",
    "we make a working hypothesis that the amplitude of the deepest data ( 52@xmath53-sec coadded data ) represents the amplitude of ( quasi-)static psf components ( such like the optical and chip - misalignment psfs ) ; the difference from that gives an estimate of atmospheric psfs ellipticities . in the bottom - panels of figure [ fig : mapvar_diff ] and",
    "figure [ fig : mapvar_texp ] , we plot the differences , from which one finds that the aperture mass variances have both the exposure time dependence and a shape similar to those obtained from the numerical simulation ( appendix [ appendix : atmos ] ) .",
    "also , the e- and b - mode variances have similar amplitudes , as expected from the numerical simulation .",
    "although the above results were derived relaying on the working hypothesis , those nice agreements would support a reasonableness of the hypothesis .",
    "we may therefore say that we successfully captured characteristic features of the atmospheric psf ellipticities in the suprime - cam data .",
    "here we consider how well the psf ellipticities can be corrected by the standard correction scheme , which we describe below .",
    "the aim of this analysis is twofold : one is to understand what sets a lower limit of the anisotropic psf correction ; the other is to evaluate the amplitude of residual psf ellipticities .",
    "to do this , we use both the dense star field data and mock data that we describe below .    before going into details ,",
    "we briefly describe a basic procedure concerning the anisotropic psf correction implemented in actual weak lensing studies so far ( see for details , heymans et al 2006 ; massey et al 2007 and references therein ) : firstly , psf ellipticities ( or other estimators of psf ) are measured from high - sn star images . in usual weak lensing analyses , a typical number density of stars used for psf sampling is @xmath54 arcmin@xmath7 .",
    "secondly , the spatial variation of psf ellipticities is modeled by fitting the psf ellipticities with an analytic function , such as a polynomial .",
    "then finally , an artificial shape deformation in galaxy images caused by the psf is corrected using the psf model delivered by the analytic function .",
    "although an actual implementation of the above procedure depends on technique of weak lensing analysis ( heymans et al 2006 ; massey et al 2007 ) , there is one common limitation which comes from a sparse sampling of stars , namely , the spatial variation of psfs on scales smaller than the mean star separation is poorly sampled , and as a result small - scale components in the psf anisotropy are hardly corrected .",
    "our psf correction scheme is based on the ksb algorithm ( kaiser et al 1995 ; hamana et al .",
    "2003 ; heymans et al 2006 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to the above references for details . here",
    ", we only describe some details concerning implementation , which are specific to this study .",
    "we use bi - variable polynomial function for modeling the spatial variation of psf ellipticites .",
    "we divide data into @xmath55 regions or into each ccd chip , and a psf model is generated for each sub - region .",
    "the order of the polynomial is set to 4th for a @xmath55-division and 2nd or 3rd for the chip - basis case .",
    "the @xmath55-division is taken because in our actual cosmic shear analysis the psf correction is made on a sub - region basis with a similar area , whereas the chip - basis analysis is used to test its ability of improving the anisotropic psf correction .",
    "-division , whereas the dotted line is for the chip - basis . from left to right , the exposure time is 1 , 5 and 25 min , respectively .",
    "[ fig : mapvar_e3_texp_chip],width=332 ]    let us start with a simpler situation using mock psf ellipticity catalogs .",
    "the mock data have the same geometry and number of objects as those of the dense star field data , that is 700 `` star - role '' objects and 30,000 `` galaxy - role '' objects ( see section [ sec : data ] ) . instead of generating mock image",
    ", we simply generate object catalogs .",
    "each object has various items ; the positions , and 3-component psf ellipticities , including optical , atmospheric , and ccd - misalignment components denoted by @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the optical component is made by using the optical aberration - motivated model , equation ( [ eq : psfaberrat ] ) , introduced in appendix [ appendix : aberration ] ; we adopted model parameters for g5 group in subsection [ sec : aberration ] .",
    "for the ccd - misalignment component , we adopt the 2nd - order polynomial models obtained in subsection [ sec : chip ] .",
    "the atmospheric component is modeled by the random field with the power spectrum having a power - law index of @xmath59 based on our finding ( see section [ appendix : atmos ] and appendix 2 ) .",
    "its amplitude is set by the empirical relation of equations ( [ eq : ps - scaling ] ) for exposure times of 1 , 5 , and 25 minutes .",
    "we compute the total ellipticity by simply adding the three components , instead of treating in the convolution manner .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation , because each ellipticity component is small .",
    "then , the anisotropic psf correction is made for mock catalogs in the procedure described above .",
    "the results from a mock simulation are presented in figure [ fig : mapvar_e3_texp_chip ] , from which the following three points can be seen .",
    "first , as mentioned above , the mean separation of stars ( @xmath54 arcmin ) , which are used to model the spatial variation of psfs , sets a fundamental limitation on the psf correction . in the case of the aperture mass ,",
    "its window function is most sensitive to fluctuations on scales of @xmath60 of the aperture size ( schneider et al .",
    "1998 ) , this defines a characteristic aperture scale of @xmath61 arcmin ; on scales larger than that , the correction works very well but on smaller scale it does very poorly ( this was argued by hoekstra et al . 2004 ) .",
    "this is especially the case for the atmospheric psf .",
    "second , in spite of the above limitation , the optical components are well corrected , even on smaller scales .",
    "the reason of this is the smoothness of the optical component ; as shown in subsection [ sec : aberration ] , the spatial variation of the optical psfs can be well fitted by a polynomial - based model .",
    "thus even with a sparse sampling , it can be well - modeled with the polynomial function .",

    "we found that the optical aberration has the largest contribution to the psf ellipticities of long - exposure ( say , longer than 10 minutes ) data .",

    "it should , however , be noted that the appearance varies widely between realizations , depending on turbulence and wind properties .",
    "we measured the power spectrum and the aperture mass variance from the simulation data and present them in figures [ fig : powerspec_arroyo ] and [ fig : mapvar_arroyo ] , respectively .",
    "the following three major findings were derived from the figures : first , the amplitude of the power spectrum decreases as @xmath131 , as was already pointed out in previous studies ( wittman 2005 ; de vries et al 2007 ; jee & tyson 20011 ; chang et al . 2012 ;",
    "2013 heymans et al .",
    "second , the power spectrum is approximated by a power - law model with a power index of @xmath59 .",
    "a plausible reason for the power - law shape is our assumption of the power - law turbulence power spectrum without a cutoff . in reality ,",
    "a large - scale cutoff ( the , so - called , outer scale ) at around 10@xmath38100 m is expected ( e.g. , hardy 1998 ) , which may result in a cutoff in the psf ellipticity power spectrum at a scale of around 1 degree .",
    "third , the atmospheric turbulence results in e / b - mode almost equally partitioned psf ellipticities . through a closer look at figure [ fig : mapvar_arroyo ] , one may however find that the e - mode amplitude is slightly , but systematically , larger than the b - mode .",
    "the reason for this is unclear and we leave it for future work .",
    "in addition to the above findings , we also find from figures [ fig : powerspec_arroyo ] and [ fig : mapvar_arroyo ] that models @xmath132 and @xmath133 give a good fit to the 60-second result . in what follows , we discuss how those correlation amplitudes depend on other observational parameters , including the exposure time and the atmospheric seeing fwhm ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "consider the case @xmath135 , where @xmath136 denotes the diameter of a telescope , and a monochromatic radiation with a wavelength @xmath137 from a point source .",
    "the wavefront from a point source is disturbed by atmospheric turbulence , and we consider , for a simple approximation , the disturbed wavefront to be segmented @xmath125-sized patches of constant phase and random phases between the individual patches ( saha 2007 , and see e.g. , figure 5.3 of that textbook for an illustration ) .",
    "the number of patches within a pupil is approximately @xmath138 .",
    "a wavefront from each patch results in a sharp speckle psf on a focal plane , and a total psf is viewed as a superposition of randomly distributed speckles over an extent of the atmospheric seeing size @xmath139 ( hardy 1998 ; saha 2000 ; see for illustrative examples , figure 3 of kaiser , tonry & luppino 2000 ; and fig 5 of jee & tyson 2011 ) . in this picture",
    ", the psf anisotropy is understood as a natural consequence of a finite number of speckles . since the disturbed wavefront changes quickly , more different speckles are accumulated as @xmath140 , and thus the psf becomes rounder .",
    "it is found from the above numerical simulation that the rms of psf ellipticities decreases as @xmath141 , which combined with the above mentioned relationships leads to the following relationships ; @xmath142 we tested this relationship against numerical simulations with different values of @xmath125 , from which the above dependences of @xmath125 and @xmath134 on @xmath143 were verified . combined the last relationship with the power - law fitting models , we have @xmath144 and @xmath145 although the above relationships are quite crude , they are useful to quickly evaluate a magnitude of atmospheric psf ellipticities for a given set of observational parameters .",
    "note that these relationships are valid only for a telescope with a diameter of 8.2 m .",
    "it may be worth pointing out that it is found from numerical simulations with different telescope diameters that the amplitude of psf ellipticities is insensitive to @xmath136 .",
    "this differs from a scaling relationship of @xmath146 expected from the above consideration ( likewise for @xmath147 ) .",
    "this difference may be explained by the diameter dependence of the psf , which is not taken into account in the above consideration .",
    "according to the diffraction theory ( e.g. , hardy 1998 ; saha 2007 ) , the psf is the inverse fourier transform of the optical transfer function ( otf ) which is the auto correlation function of the product of the telescope pupil function with the atmospheric phase function . in that relationship",
    ", the diameter of telescope enters through the pupil function .",
    "therefore , roughly and intuitively speaking , the power spectrum of psf ellipticities relates to the otf , and the diameter acts as a large - scale cutoff .",
    "since the turbulence power spectrum has a larger power on a larger scales ( kolmogorov power spectrum has the shape of @xmath148 ) , the large - scale cutoff imposed by the telescope diameter may have a great impact on the amplitude of the psf ellipticities .",
