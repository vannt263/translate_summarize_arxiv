    "the most recent measurement of the @xmath5 branching ratio , ref . , based on 62,000 events , dates back to 1972 , more than 30 years ago , and relies on a sample of 105 kaon decays .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "quote an error of 0.7% , the statistical error due to the event count being 0.4% .",
    "this error is reduced in the pdg fit @xcite to 0.27% and the value changed by 0.3% .",
    "while the procedure is correct in principle , it can lead to incorrect results because of incorrect data included in the fit .",
    "this has been the case sometimes , leading among other things to the suggestion , also in ref .",
    ", of a value for @xmath1 apparently inconsistent with unitarity of the ckm mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "another problem with measurements performed more than 30 years ago is due to the fact that the effect of radiative corrections was not fully appreciated .",
    "it is therefore impossible to understand what fraction of the radiative decay is included in the quoted results .",
    "inclusion of all radiation is however necessary to compare to models or to extract fundamental parameters such as a coupling constant .",
    "with all the above in mind as well as recent developments in numerical or lattice qcd calculation , we have begun a program of new precise , fully inclusive , kaon branching ratio measurement .",
    "+ we report in the following a measurement of br ( ) performed with the kloe detector at , the frascati .",
    "the measurement is based on an integrated luminosity of 175 pb , collected in 2001 - 02 .",
    "is an  collider operated at a total energy of @xmath6 mev , the mass of the ( 1020)-meson .",
    "equal energy positron and electron beams collide at an angle of ( @xmath7)25 mrad and produce -mesons with a small transverse momentum of 12.5 mev / c .",
    "the collision frame moves therefore in the laboratory with a velocity @xmath80.0125 . in the center of mass",
    ", the -meson decays into anti - collinear  pairs of 125 mev / c momentum . in the laboratory",
    "this remains approximately true : detection of a @xmath9 tags the presence of a @xmath10 of given momentum and direction .",
    "the decay products of the  pair define two spatially well separated regions called in the following the tag and the signal hemispheres . identified @xmath10 decays tag a @xmath9 beam and provide an absolute count .",
    "this procedure is a unique feature of a @xmath11-factory and provides the means for measurements of absolute branching ratios , i.e. ratios @xmath12 rather than ratios of br s @xmath13 .",
    "the kloe detector consists of a large volume drift chamber and a sampling calorimeter . the drift chamber ( dc ) @xcite , of 3.3 m length and 2 m radius , has a full stereo geometry and operates with a 90% helium-10% isobutane gas mixture .",
    "tracking in the dc provides measurements of the vector momentum of charged particles with @xmath14 and two track vertices to 3 mm . in the following we use a coordinate system with the @xmath15-axis defined as the bisectrix of the  beams , the @xmath16-axis vertical and the @xmath17-axis toward the center of the collider rings .",
    "+ the calorimeter ( emc ) @xcite consists of a cylindrical barrel and two endcaps covering a solid angle of 98% of 4@xmath18 .",
    "photons showering in the lead - scintillator - fiber emc structure are detected as local energy deposits by clustering signals from read - out elements .",
    "the calorimeter information consists of energy , position of entry point and time of arrival with accuracies of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "calorimeter clusters not associated with a dc track indicate arrival of neutral particles and the computed time of flight identifies photons with excellent precision .",
    "time of flight also allows good separation of electrons from muons , pions and kaons . +",
    "a superconducting coil surrounds the entire detector and produces a solenoidal field @xmath23 t. the trigger @xcite is based on the detection of isolated energy deposits in the calorimeter and on hit multiplicity in the drift chamber . only events triggered by the calorimeter have been used in the present analysis .",
    "this choice ensures a far more reliable estimate of all necessary efficiencies .",
    "the trigger system also includes a veto for cosmic - ray muons ( cosmic ray veto or crv ) based on energy deposits in the outermost layers of the calorimeter and followed by a third - level software trigger able to identify most of the  events .",
    "a software filter ( filfo or flf ) , based on the topology and multiplicity of calorimeter clusters and drift chamber hits , is applied to filter out machine background . +",
    "both crv and flf are sources of event rejection .",
    "their effect on the br measurement has been studied on control samples which do not undergo , respectively , the crv , and the flf filter .",
    "the entire data sample of 175 pb is divided into two subsamples . +",
    "some 60 pb of data have been used for the br measurement .",
    "the remaining 115 pb have been used to evaluate efficiencies and the background .",
    "the branching ratio measurement @xcite is based on the use of  decays for event tagging and to search for the signal among @xmath24 decays .",
    "the tagging selection is based on the presence of a two - tracks vertex in the dc which signals the @xmath25 decay @xcite .",
    "+ nuclear interactions , ni , of kaons affects the branching ratio measurement but not the tagging procedure . since ( ) ( ) /102 , the choice above minimizes the corrections to be calculated to account for the effect .",
    "the corrections are in fact negligible .",
    "the large number of @xmath24 decays is sufficient for achieving a statistic accuracy at the 0.1% level , comparable with the systematic error .",
    "+ to avoid any bias due to differences in the trigger efficiency among the @xmath24 decay modes on the signal `` hemisphere '' , the particles on the tagging side are required to deposit enough energy in the calorimeter to trigger the data acquisition .",
    "nevertheless , the tagging criteria exhibit a residual , small dependence on the decay mode of the @xmath26 on the signal hemisphere , introducing a tag bias or tb , that has been studied using monte carlo simulation ( mc ) samples @xcite and checked on data .",
    "+ the search for positive kaon moving outwards in the dc , with momentum @xmath27 mev / c , is performed on the sample of tagged events .",
    "the point of closest approach to the beam line with coordinates @xmath28 is evaluated extrapolating the kaon track backwards to the beam line , taking into account the kaon energy loss .",
    "kaon tracks with @xmath29 cm and @xmath3010 cm , and kaon decay vertices in the fiducial volume , @xmath31 cm , are selected .",
    "+ the number of  decays is obtained counting the events with 225@xmath32400 mev / c ; @xmath33 is the charged decay particle momentum computed in the kaon rest frame assuming the pion mass . the @xmath33 distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcspectrum ] .",
    "newfig1;10 ;     + the spectrum in fig.[fig : mcspectrum ] , obtained from mc simulation , shows a 2% contamination from various background sources , namely , .",
    "since the maximum momentum of the pions from three - pion decays is 125 mev / c , these channels do not contribute to the background .",
    "all the background sources in this analysis have one neutral pion in the final state .",
    "the neutral pions are identified by detecting the photons from @xmath34 decay .",
    "the photons are identified as isolated energy deposits in emc not associated with tracks and satisfying the constraints on @xmath35 mass reconstruction and time correlation with the kaon decay vertex @xcite .",
    "this selection allows us to obtain directly from data the @xmath33 distribution of the background .",
    "+ the @xmath33 distribution for the signal events has been obtained from a data control sample described in the following efficiency evaluation .",
    "this distribution has been used together with the shape of the background sources to fit the overall @xmath33 spectrum , figure [ fig : fitspectrum ] left , and to perform background subtraction .",
    "the result , after background subtraction , is shown in figure [ fig : fitspectrum ] right .     + the branching ratio is obtained from : @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the events selected as signal ( hereafter signal count ) ,",
    "@xmath38 is the number of tagged events and @xmath39 is the efficiency . @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the corrections for the effects due to the cosmic - ray veto and the filfo procedure , and @xmath42 accounts for the tag bias effect .",
    "+ the efficiency of the analysis cuts has been determined directly on data using a control sample of  events selected exploiting their typical signature in the emc .",
    "the control sample consists of events with @xmath43 , providing the tag , and signal events   selected using only emc information .",
    "this criterion is mostly independent from the selection procedure based on dc information that has been used for obtaining the signal count .",
    "the emc selection requires only one cluster with e @xmath44 80 mev ( high energy cut ) , plus any number of clusters with energy below 20 mev ( low energy cut ) which can be due to photons from  .",
    "further cuts on the energy ( @xmath45 ) and on the distance in the tranverse plane from the @xmath15-axis ( @xmath46 ) of the cluster are applied to get rid of machine background and spurious clusters .",
    "namely we require the cluster either to be on the barrel @xmath47197 cm or to satisfy the relation @xmath48 .",
    "a correction of about @xmath49 , due to a tiny difference between the efficiency evaluated on the control sample and the selection efficiency on the signal sample , has been estimated from mc .",
    "the efficiency is @xmath50 .",
    "+ the corrections to the event rejection described above , @xmath40=1.0005 and @xmath51 , have been directly measured on control samples which do not undergo , respectively , the cosmic - ray veto , and the filfo filter .",
    "the correction for the tag bias , @xmath42=1.01640.0002 , has been evaluated on monte carlo samples and the distribution of the variables used for the tag selection have been checked on data .",
    "the following sources of systematic uncertainties have been studied varying the selection cuts :    * the requirements on the tagging hemisphere ; * the trigger requirements ; * the definition of the fiducial volume ; * the background evaluation procedure ; * the choice of the @xmath52 $ ] range ; * the energy cuts for the efficiency sample ; * the effect of high - energy radiative photons ( @xmath5320 mev ) .",
    "furthermore , the dependence of the measurement on the charged kaon lifetime , which affects the estimate of the geometrical acceptance , has been studied varying the lifetime value used in the mc simulation .",
    "the effects due to @xmath24 nuclear interactions have been evaluated from mc simulation and measurements available in literature .",
    "the stability of the measurement with respect to different data taking conditions has been checked .",
    "the corresponding systematic errors are listed in table [ tab : errors ] .",
