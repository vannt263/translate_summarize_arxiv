    "we consider a fluid composed of two different phases , with respective volume fractions @xmath0,$ ] depending on time @xmath1 $ ] , for some @xmath2 , and space @xmath3 and satisfying the following system :    @xmath4    where the @xmath5-dimensional vectors @xmath6 are the velocities of @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , @xmath9 is the gradient of an incompressible pressure term , @xmath10 are experimental constant values and @xmath11 are given source terms , possibly dependent on @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in ( [ bl_system1 ] ) , the momentum equations for the solid and the liquid phases are different : in the first one , @xmath12 is the excess stress tensor , while , following @xcite , @xcite , there is no excess stress tensor for the liquid part .",
    "summing the first and the second equation , using the two last conditions in ( [ bl_system1 ] ) , and setting @xmath13 , yields : @xmath14    where the last equation represents the incompressibility of the mixture as a whole .",
    "more generally , system ( [ bl_system ] ) is the two phases case of a wide class of multiphase models of fluids of an arbitrary number @xmath15 of constituents .",
    "these models arise from mixture theory , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and their general formulation is as follows :    @xmath16    where    * @xmath17 is the density of the @xmath18 phase , assumed to be constant , in accordance with the incompressibility condition , * @xmath19 is the volume fraction of each constituent , * @xmath20 is the specific velocity , * @xmath21 is the mass exchange rate between different phases , * @xmath22 is the partial stress tensor , * @xmath23 is the interaction force , which is related to interactions between different phases across the interface .    for more details about the derivation of model ( [ general_mixture_model ] ) see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "these models arises in many fields , as tumor growth and vasculogenesis in @xcite , biological tissues and porous media in @xcite .",
    "in particular , among several applications , we refer to the model proposed in @xcite , which describes biological structures called _ biofilms _ , composed by four different phases : bacteria , dead bacteria , extracellular polymeric matrix , and the liquid phase , with respective volume fractions @xmath24 this model satisfies the following equations :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 are respectively the velocities and the source terms for @xmath27 and @xmath9 is the incompressible pressure .",
    "actually , system ( [ bl_system ] ) is just the two phases case of ( [ bdel ] ) , where the three `` solid '' species are lumped together .",
    "besides , system ( [ bl_system ] ) is worth considering , since many models for biological applications are constituted by two phases as , for instance , the one presented in @xcite . in the following , we will focus on system ( [ bl_system ] ) for simplicity reasons , but the arguments will be briefly generalized to the case of system ( [ bdel ] ) in section 4 .",
    "although mixture models are largely diffused , up to now the analytical theory has been mainly developed in one space dimension , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , while some results about linear stability and numerical approximations were considered in @xcite .",
    "more recently , a complete analytical study of the one dimensional biofilms model ( [ bdel ] ) and the related two phases system ( [ bl_system ] ) , with the proof of the global existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions and the analysis of their asymptotic behavior for initial data , which are small perturbations of the equilibrium point , were given in @xcite .",
    "actually , in the one dimensional case , a great simplification occurs due to the fact that , by adding the mass balance equations of ( [ general_mixture_model ] ) for @xmath28 we get the incompressibility condition for the mixture as a whole , which , in the one dimensional case , reads @xmath29 after some calculations , the equality ( [ incompressibility_condition ] ) allows us to solve for the incompressible pressure @xmath9 in ( [ general_mixture_model ] ) . besides , the remaining system is symmetrizable hyperbolic ( see @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) , and so the standard theory applies . on the other hand , in several space dimensions there is not a simple way to deal with the term @xmath9 .",
    "more precisely , considering model ( [ bl_system ] ) , the incompressibility condition is the following : @xmath30 in order to work using a divergence free formulation , we define    @xmath31    and we could try to apply classical methods used for incompressible fluids , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which are essentially based on the projection of the velocity field onto the space of the divergence free vectors .",
    "however , in our case , even in the divergence free variables , there are some difficulties . the first one is given by the interaction between the _ friedrichs _ symmetrizer of the hyperbolic part of system ( [ bl_system ] ) and the gradient of the incompressible pressure term .",
    "actually , the scalar product induced by the classical symmetrizer does not preserve the orthogonality of the gradient of the incompressible pressure with respect to the divergence free average velocity .",
    "this happens since the symmetrizer and the pressure part of the system do not commute and , moreover , their commutator is still a first order operator , see section 2 below .",
    "therefore , we can not get rid of the incompressible pressure , unlike in the case of the incompressible euler equations , see for instance @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is not obvious how to get useful energy estimates in sobolev spaces for system ( [ bl_system ] ) , since our hydrostatic pressure does not possess enough regularity in space .",
    "in fact , looking at the elliptic equation for the pressure @xmath32 , which is obtained applying the divergence operator to the momentum equations in system ( [ bl_system ] ) , we have @xmath33 where @xmath34",
    "let us compare ( [ pressure_elliptic_equation1 ] ) with the elliptic equation for the pressure @xmath35 of the incompressible euler equations with velocity @xmath36 , see @xcite , namely @xmath37 starting from velocity fields @xmath38 in ( [ pressure_elliptic_equation1 ] ) and @xmath36 in ( [ pressure_euler ] ) with the same @xmath39 regularity for some @xmath40 + 1,$ ] our pressure @xmath32 in ( [ pressure_elliptic_equation1 ] ) is only in @xmath39 , while @xmath35 in ( [ pressure_euler ] ) is in @xmath41 .",
    "so , because of this lack of regularity , which is due not only to the inertial term @xmath42 but also to the compressible pressure term @xmath12 , we are unable to close the energy estimates for system ( [ bl_system ] ) .    for all these reasons , the different approaches used for incompressible fluids do not work for ( [ bl_system ] ) . for instance , even if the numerical simulations in @xcite , which use the _ chorin - temam _ projection method @xcite , seem to yield some reliable results , we do not know how to prove any rigorous convergence result for this approximation scheme in this case . in fact ,",
    "while the @xmath43-norm of the projected solution is estimated step by step by the @xmath43-norm of the non - projected vector , thanks to the _ hodge _ decomposition theorem @xcite , this property no more holds for the scalar product induced by the symmetrizer and so we are unable to control the energy estimates .",
    "this structural difficulty is also the reason why the singular perturbation approximation in @xcite , which can be viewed as a continuous version of the projection method , does not work for system ( [ bl_system ] ) . also , we are not able to prove the convergence of the approximation used by _",
    "valli _ & _ zajazckowski _ in @xcite to solve the incompressible euler equations , since , again , we can not get the necessary energy estimates from the elliptic equation ( [ pressure_elliptic_equation1 ] ) . for completeness",
    ", we notice that the same holds for the artificial compressibility method of _ temam _ in @xcite , since there is no classical symmetrizer for the related approximating compressible system and the _ lax _ symmetrizer that we have found does not satisfy the assumptions required in studying singular perturbations approximations , as in @xcite .    in spite of these negative remarks , in this paper",
    "we prove the convergence of one approximation to system ( [ bl_system ] ) , made by the composition of some smoothing operators and the _ leray _ projector , see @xcite and @xcite for different applications of this technique . here",
    ", the main idea is as follows .",
    "first , we apply the projector onto the space of the vectors such that the averaged velocity @xmath44 is divergence free .",
    "then , we consider the highest order part of the paradifferential operator associated to the projected system ( [ bl_system ] ) , which has a useful structural property",
    ". it can be verified that the highest order part is a strongly hyperbolic operator of the first order , therefore it is possible to find a _ lax _",
    "symmetrizer for it . the construction of this symmetrizer is essentially based on the techniques developed in @xcite , which are combined here to some ideas in @xcite .",
    "we point out that , the main point here is to symmetrize the whole projected operator , rather than just use the symmetrizer of the hyperbolic part of ( [ bl_system ] ) .",
    "using paradifferential calculus , we are able to establish some uniform energy estimates and the convergence of this method to ( [ bl_system ] ) , as well as in the case of the more general model ( [ bdel ] ) , both in two space dimensions .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in section 2",
    "we discuss the general setting and the main properties of the two phases system ( [ bl_system ] ) in two space dimensions , by emphasizing the difficulties for the various formulations of the problem .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the definition and well - posedness of our approximation , using an approach based on paradifferential calculus , and a proof of its convergence . in section 4",
    ", we show how to apply the previous arguments to the more general system ( [ bdel ] ) , always in two space dimensions .",
    "finally , in section 5 we discuss the difficulties we have found to extend these results to the the three dimensional case .",
    "let @xmath45 . system ( [ bl_system ] ) can be written in the following compact form :    @xmath46    where the term @xmath47 is given by the gradient of the hydrostatic incompressible pressure    @xmath48    and the source term have the following expression    @xmath49    where    @xmath50    and @xmath51 are experimental constants .",
    "the initial data related to ( [ bl_system_compact1 ] ) are the following : @xmath52    although most of the calculations in this first section hold in the general @xmath5-dimensional case , we limit our consideration only to the two dimensional case . in one space dimension , in fact , system ( [ bl_system_compact1 ] )",
    "is a particular version of that already discussed in @xcite , while in three space dimensions there are some structural problems that lead to technical difficulties , as we will see in section 5 .",
    "setting @xmath53 , system ( [ bl_system_compact1 ] ) reads    @xmath54    with @xmath55 in , @xmath56 in and the initial data @xmath57 in .",
    "the flux matrices are : @xmath58    * assumption . * [ assumption ] from ( [ a12 ] ) , the terms @xmath7 and @xmath59 can not vanish . then",
    ", we take @xmath60    [ translation ] the assumption above is quite natural , in fact , from the mass balance equation for @xmath7 in ( [ bl_system ] ) , if the initial data @xmath61 ( and @xmath62 ) in ( [ initial_data ] ) does not vanish for all @xmath63 , then , under some standard assumptions of regularity , @xmath64 ( and @xmath65 ) can not vanish too . in particular ,",

    "taking @xmath77 we have @xmath78 in this section , to simplify the presentation , we define the translated system , which will be considered in section 3 .",
    "let @xmath79 with @xmath80 in ( [ equilibrium_point1 ] ) .",
    "then , we will study the following system : @xmath81 with initial data @xmath82 and @xmath83 in ( [ initial_data ] ) .",
    "we provide now the definition of classical local solutions to ( [ bl_system ] ) .",
    "[ classical_solutions ] let @xmath84 be fixed .",
    "the function @xmath85 is a classical solution to system ( [ bl_system_compact1 ] ) , if @xmath86 , h^{s}(\\mathbb{r}^{2}))\\cap c^{1}([0,t ] , h^{s-1}(\\mathbb{r}^{2}))$ ] for any time @xmath87 and @xmath88 solves system ( [ bl_compact_translated1 ] ) in the classical sense , with initial data @xmath89 in ( [ translated_initial ] , where @xmath32 is a function such that @xmath90 , h^{s-1}(\\mathbb{r}^{2})).$ ]    in the remainder of this section , we just omit the tilde to simplify the notations . considering ( [ a12 ] ) , it is easy to find a diagonal matrix that symmetrizes the first order part @xmath91 of system ( [ bl_system_compact ] .",
    "the _ friedrichs _ ( or classical ) symmetrizer is @xmath92 the existence of this symmetrizer for @xmath93 implies that , disregarding the pressure term , system ( [ bl_system_compact ] ) is hyperbolic . nevertheless , that classical symmetrizer is not useful to close some energy estimates , since we have to deal also with the incompressible pressure term @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , in the sobolev spaces @xmath94 with @xmath84 , when we take the @xmath95-derivative of system ( [ bl_system_compact ] ) and multiply by @xmath96 in order to get energy estimates , the right - hand side of the equation contains the following scalar product in @xmath97 : @xmath98 @xmath99 unfortunately , taking @xmath100 , the pressure term @xmath32 has not enough regularity , as shown by the elliptic equation ( [ pressure_elliptic_equation1 ] ) , and then we are unable to close our estimates . besides , the symmetrizer ( [ a0 ] ) depends on the variable @xmath101 whose components do not depend explicitly on the average velocity @xmath102 which is , instead , the divergence free vector field associated to ( [ bl_system_compact ] ) .",
    "then , we can try to introduce the new variables @xmath103 so setting @xmath104 it can be easily seen that , passing to the new variable @xmath105 the fourth equation of ( [ bl_system ] ) yields @xmath106 which is exactly the incompressibility condition for the mixture as a whole .",
    "moreover , the equation for the average velocity @xmath107 which is @xmath108 contains the gradient of the incompressible pressure @xmath9 alone , without multiplication by any phase volume fraction , while the equation for the relative velocity @xmath109 @xmath110 is free from the incompressible pressure . considering ( [ change_variables ] ) , let @xmath111 be the diffeomorphism so defined @xmath112 system ( [ bl_system_compact ] ) , can be written in the following compact form : @xmath113    with initial data    @xmath114    where    @xmath115    and @xmath116 explicitly , @xmath117",

    "symbolic symmetrizer @xmath136 , see again @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite and the discussion in section 3 below .",
    "therefore , the hyperbolic part of ( [ bl_system_compact_newvariables ] ) is symmetrizable .",
    "unfortunately , again , the mere existence of a symmetrizer is not enough to get energy estimates for system ( [ bl_system_compact_newvariables ] ) , since we have to deal with the incompressible pressure term and then , by definition , with the projector operator in ( [ p_operator ] ) . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the interaction between the symbolic symmetrizer @xmath136 and the gradient of the pressure term @xmath9 gives structural problems .",
    "let us define the generalized projector operator : @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the standard leray projector , namely the projector onto the divergence free vector valued functions .",
    "the operators @xmath136 and @xmath139 do not commute and their commutator does not improve on the order of the original symbols .",

    "if at first we symmetrize the system by using the paradifferential operator @xmath136 , the pressure gives the term @xmath150 after that , when we project the equation by applying @xmath139 to it , the latter term reads @xmath151\\tilde{f}_{p},\\ ] ] whose symbol contains the smoothed version of the following term of degree 1 in @xmath148 : @xmath152 @xmath153 which is still a first order operator , then neither we are able to get energy estimates because of the lack of regularity of @xmath32 , as discussed before and shown in ( [ pressure_elliptic_equation1 ] ) , nor to get rid of the pressure term @xmath32 by using the projector operator @xmath139 .    to be complete , we point out that system ( [ bl_system_compact ] ) in the new variable @xmath154 has also a classical symmetrizer @xmath155    which is strictly positive for @xmath156 small enough and under some assumptions on @xmath157 discussed in remark [ translation ] .",
    "anyway , again , the classical symmetrizer ( [ classical_symm_v ] ) is not compatible with the projector operator ( [ p_operator ] ) , and this can be seen by arguing as for the symbolic symmetrizer related to @xmath136 .",
    "taking inspiration from our preliminary work @xcite , we aim to propose a different symmetrization strategy for our problem , to be able to estimate correctly the pressure term .",
    "we apply first the operator @xmath139 to system ( [ bl_system_compact_newvariables ] ) .",
