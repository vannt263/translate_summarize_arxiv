    "any closed orientable triangulated @xmath0manifold @xmath1 has a * heegaard surface * , which is an embedded surface that decomposes @xmath1 into two handlebodies . by adding trivial handles",
    ", one can construct heegaard surfaces of @xmath1 of arbitrarily large genus .",
    "an important problem is to construct a heegaard surface of @xmath1 of _ minimal _ genus . though this problem has an algorithmic solution for closed orientable atoroidal haken manifolds by work of johannson  @xcite , it is still open for non - haken manifolds .",
    "one approach to the non - haken case is based on a result of casson and gordon  @xcite .",
    "it states that any minimal genus heegaard surface @xmath2 of a closed orientable irreducible non - haken manifold @xmath1 is * strongly irreducible * , i.e. , any two simple closed essential curves on @xmath2 bounding embedded discs in different connected components of @xmath3 intersect each other in at least two points .",
    "in fact any compact orientable @xmath0manifold can be decomposed along incompressible surfaces so that the pieces have strongly irreducible heegaard surfaces with boundary  @xcite .    stocking  @xcite has shown that any strongly irreducible heegaard surface is isotopic to a so - called almost normal surface , a mild generalization of normal surfaces that goes back to rubinstein  @xcite .",
    "this is amazing , since normal surfaces , introduced by kneser  @xcite in his study of connected sums of @xmath0manifolds , have been designed to deal with incompressible surfaces , whereas heegaard surfaces bound two handlebodies and are thus completely compressible on both sides .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a new and shorter proof of stocking s result .",
    "we follow in this paper the terminology of matveev  @xcite .",
    "we define it in detail in section  [ sec : almost ] and here give just an outline .",
    "let @xmath1 be a closed orientable @xmath0manifold with a triangulation @xmath4 .",
    "a closed embedded surface in @xmath1 is @xmath5normal if its intersection with any tetrahedron is formed by copies of the pieces shown in figure  [ fig : pieces ] , which are called normal triangles , squares and octagons .",
    "the surface is @xmath6normal if it is formed by normal triangles and squares only .",
    "let @xmath7 be an * unknotted arc * for some @xmath6normal surface @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath7 is contained in a tetrahedron @xmath9 ; connects two different components of @xmath10 ; and there is an embedded disc in @xmath9 whose boundary consists of @xmath7 , one arc in @xmath11 and two arcs in @xmath10 . from @xmath12 we cut out small discs around the endpoints of @xmath7 , glue in an annulus ( a `` tube '' ) along @xmath7 and denote the result by @xmath13",
    " see section  [ sec : basics ] for a more general definition .",
    "[ thm : heegaard - an ] let @xmath1 be a closed orientable irreducible triangulated @xmath0manifold , and let @xmath14 be a strongly irreducible heegaard surface .",
    "either there is a @xmath6normal surface @xmath8 and an unknotted arc @xmath7 such that @xmath15 , or @xmath2 is isotopic to a @xmath5normal surface with exactly one octagon .",
    "we briefly outline our proof .",
    "it is easy to show that there are @xmath6normal surfaces @xmath16 that can be `` completed '' to form disjoint surfaces @xmath17 , by adding some tubes disjoint from the edges of @xmath4 ( possibly multiple , knotted , nested tubes ) . here",
    "@xmath18 is a so - called upper trivial and @xmath19 a lower trivial surface . by application of a classical finiteness result of kneser for @xmath6normal surfaces ,",
    "we choose @xmath20 and @xmath21 so that any @xmath6normal surface with an upper ( resp .",
    "lower ) trivial completion isotopic to @xmath2 separating @xmath18 from @xmath19 is `` essentially the same '' as @xmath20 ( resp .",
    "@xmath21 ) .",
    "if @xmath18 ( or similarly @xmath19 ) satisfies a certain technical condition then we apply the reduction technique that we have developed in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "if the first alternative of theorem  [ thm : heegaard - an ] does not hold then the result of the reduction is isotopic to @xmath2 and is an upper trivial completion of some @xmath6normal surface different from @xmath20 ( in contradiction to the choice of @xmath16 ) .    if , instead , @xmath18 and @xmath19 do not satisfy the mentioned technical condition , we apply a _ thin position _ argument . if the first alternative of theorem  [ thm : heegaard - an ] does not hold , then it yields a surface @xmath22 that is an upper or lower trivial completion of a @xmath5normal surface with exactly one octagon .",
    "again , we apply the reduction technique to @xmath23 , and derive a contradiction to the choice of @xmath16 , unless the second alternative of theorem  [ thm : heegaard - an ] holds .",
    "thus in either case , one alternative is true .",
    "the main reason why our proof is shorter than stocking s is the application of the completion and reduction techniques .",
    "this makes thin position a more efficient tool .",
    "actually we only need to know one basic fact about thin position : a level surface in a thin position embedding has no pair of nested or independent compressing discs .",
    "the reduction technique was used in  @xcite to obtain bounds for the bridge number of links formed by edges of a triangulation of @xmath24 .",
    "it also allows to simplify the correctness proof of the rubinstein ",
    "thompson algorithm ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which is implicit in  @xcite .",
    "we took a few technical results from the literature . to make this paper",
    "essentially self - contained , we include proofs or at least proof sketches for most cited results .",
    "specifically , we re - prove scharlemann s `` no nesting '' lemma  @xcite , that is at the base of our completion technique .",
    "it is convenient for us , though not strictly necessary , to work in a submanifold @xmath25 whose complement is a @xmath0ball containing all vertices of @xmath4 , and any @xmath6normal sphere in @xmath26 is a copy of @xmath27 .",
    "it is known  @xcite that such a submanifold exists for any triangulated irreducible @xmath0manifold different from @xmath24 .",
