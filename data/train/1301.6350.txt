    "stochastic partial differential equations arise as a model in many scientific fields and the for applications much needed theory of numerical solutions to such equations is growing successfully .",
    "however , it is often the case that particular examples such as stochastic reaction diffusion equations , even with very simple structure of the nonlinear term , fail to fit in the assumptions of the majority of publications in this research area . in this article",
    ", we study such an spde of reaction diffusion type where the nonlinear drift term satisfies a one - sided lipschitz condition only and is of the form    equation[eq : srde ]    ( t , ) & = _ ^2 v(t , ) + _ 1 ( , v(t,),w(t , ) ) + b ( , v(t,),w(t , ) ) ( t , ) + ( t , ) & = _ 2 ( , v(t , ) , w(t , ) ) .    for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is some gaussian white noise .",
    "this system consists of two variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where the former satisfies some semi - linear stochastic evolution equation and the latter is a kind of control variable coupled to @xmath3 in an equation without diffusion and no further independent external noise .",
    "the motivation for such a system comes from the field of neurobiology , in particular we consider the spatially extended stochastic fitzhugh - nagumo system , modeling the propagation of the action potential in the axon of a neuron , see e.g. @xcite and section 6 for details .",
    "the goal of this article is to prove @xmath5-convergence including explicit error estimates of an easy to implement spatial approximation scheme .",
    "we consider the well - known finite difference method which has been studied by many authors , but to the best of our knowledge there is no convergence result which gives explicit rates if the nonlinear drift term is not lipschitz continuous .",
    "crucial references in the literature studying similar equations to are gyngy @xcite , where uniform convergence in probability without a rate is proven , as well as pettersson & signahl @xcite for a similar result with multiplicative noise .",
    "both results are obtained without a global lipschitz condition .",
    "moreover we want to mention a series of articles by gyngy & millet @xcite , where the authors work in the variational approach and incorporate various spatial approximation schemes for spdes driven by a finite dimensional noise . however , equation is beyond their results since it excludes polynomially growing nonlinearities . on the other hand ,",
    "it is worth mentioning that there are existing results by jentzen @xcite and liu @xcite which incorporate our one - sided lipschitz assumption , but use a different approach , the spectral galerkin approximation , to show path - wise convergence and @xmath5-convergence with explicit rates , respectively .",
    "the spde is studied within the variational approach , see e.g. @xcite , and we only use the a priori known regularity of the exact solution to prove @xmath5-convergence with an implicitly given rate in theorem [ maintheorem ] .",
    "this rate is given in terms of the regularity of the exact solution .",
    "if there is a better a priori information on the exact solution , this rate can be made explicit in terms of the approximation parameter .",
    "the proof is essentially based on uniform exponential a priori estimates for the approximating solutions obtained in proposition [ propapriori ] and the it formula for the variational solution .",
    "most of the above mentioned articles concern fully discrete schemes , i.e. a discretization of the space and time domain .",
    "we only consider the spatial approximation part , which reduces the infinite dimensional problem to an sde on a finite dimensional space , and then has to be solved with existing theory and the errors accumulate .",
    "nevertheless , let us make a brief comment on the time discretization .",
    "one of the most popular approaches is the euler - maruyama scheme because of its simplicity and low computational effort .",
    "it is known that this scheme converges to the exact solution of the sde for equations with globally lipschitz continuous drift and diffusion coefficients .",
    "of course , also our approximated equation fails to satisfy such a condition . for such equations with super - linearly growing drift and/or diffusion",
    "it was shown recently by hutzenthaler , jentzen & kloeden @xcite that the euler - maruyama approximations diverge in a strong and weak sense .",
    "an obvious remedy for this problem is to use e.g. the implicit euler scheme , which is known to converge , however it requires more computational effort than the explicit scheme .",
    "again hutzenthaler , jentzen & kloeden @xcite suggest a so - called tamed euler scheme that is explicit and computationally less expensive .",
    "it is also observed that the runtime as a function of the dimension grows linearly and quadratic for the tamed euler and implicit euler scheme , respectively .",
    "of course , this favors the tamed euler scheme for our high dimensional approximating problem .",
    "thus , we propose solving with a combination of finite differences and the tamed euler scheme .",
    "the article is structured as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the precise setting and assumptions on the coefficients of and state the existence and uniqueness result for its corresponding abstract stochastic evolution equation in the sense of variational solutions . in section 3",
    "we introduce the approximation scheme and state the main result in theorem [ maintheorem ] .",
    "sections 4 and 5 contain the proof of this theorem .",
    "the last part is devoted to the application of our results to a spatially extended fitzhugh - nagumo system with noise .",
    "this model has been studied by tuckwell @xcite concerning the impact of noise on the generation of action potentials and the reliability of faithful signal transmission .",
    "theorem [ maintheorem ] now allows to explicitly quantify the approximation error of the finite difference approximation . as an illustration for the use of our result , we state an estimator for the probability of propagation failure based on numerical observations as well as confidence intervals for this estimators .",
    "these depend on the statistical monte - carlo and the numerical approximation error and are explicitly constructed .",
