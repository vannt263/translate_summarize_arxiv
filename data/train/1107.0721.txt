    "the nature of what constitutes the non - baryonic dark matter in our universe remains one of the most fundamental mysteries in particle physics  @xcite .",
    "the most precise measurements of the relic abundance of this dark matter to date are those derived from wmap data  @xcite , which yield a value @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the hubble constant . beyond this , we know very little about the properties of this dominant constituent of the matter density in our universe , save that its interactions with the fields of the standard model ( sm ) are extremely weak .",
    "one of the reasons why the nature of the dark matter remains so elusive is its apparent stability .",
    "observational constraints on the lifetime @xmath2 of any decaying dark - matter candidate @xmath3 are quite stringent .",
    "indeed , for any particle with a relic abundance @xmath4 , current limits  @xcite from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurements , , require that @xmath5 for this reason , most models of the dark sector posit the existence of a single dark - matter particle ( or , in the case of certain multi - component dark - matter scenarios  @xcite , a small number of such particles ) which is either absolutely stable ( with that stability usually conferred by some additional symmetry , such as r - parity in supersymmetric models , kk - parity  @xcite in universal extra dimensions  @xcite , or t - parity  @xcite in little - higgs theories  @xcite ) , or else sufficiently long - lived as to satisfy the bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq : decayingdmlifetimelimit ] ) .",
    "indeed , the phenomenological consequences of dark - matter decays in models with unstable dark - matter candidates  @xcite can be quite significant .",
    "recently , an alternative framework for addressing the dark - matter question has been proposed  @xcite . in this",
    "so - called `` dynamical dark matter '' paradigm , the dark sector comprises not one or merely a few particle species , but rather a vast ensemble of different fields @xmath6 , each of which contributes only a fraction @xmath7 of the total dark - matter relic abundance @xmath8 .",
    "none of these fields is presumed to be absolutely stable , and thus a non - zero decay width @xmath9 is associated with each field . however , in this framework , the individual relic abundances of the @xmath6 fields are presumed to be generated in such a way that the most stable members of that ensemble are the most abundant . by contrast , the abundances of the more unstable members are suppressed according to the size of their decay widths .",
    "it is this balancing between @xmath9 and @xmath7 which makes it possible for the phenomenological constraints relating to the effects of dark - matter decays to be satisfied .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we focused on the model - independent aspects of our dynamical dark - matter framework , discussing its broad theoretical properties , without any detailed phenomenological analysis or comparison with data .",
    "by contrast , in this work , as a `` proof of concept , '' we provide an explicit model of dynamical dark matter . in this model ,",
    "the fields which collectively constitute the dynamical dark - matter ensemble are the kk excitations of a light axion - like field propagating in the bulk of a spacetime with one or more large , flat extra dimensions . in this model ,",
    "the fields of the sm , as well as the gauge fields associated with some additional , non - abelian gauge group @xmath10 which confines at a scale @xmath11 , are taken to be localized on a four - dimensional subspace of that bulk .",
    "the axion field is assumed to couple to the gauge fields of @xmath10 ( and also potentially to one or more of the sm fields ) via non - renormalizable operators suppressed by some effective , four - dimensional cutoff scale @xmath12 .",
    "we shall demonstrate that within this setup , the resulting ensemble of axion kk modes naturally satisfies all applicable observational constraints on dark - matter decays  even if the stability of this `` dark tower '' is entirely unprotected .",
    "another advantage of this particular dynamical dark - matter model is that it is not only phenomenologically viable , but also theoretically well motivated . in any theory",
    "in which the sm fields reside on a brane , the kk excitations of any bulk field are , from the point of view of the four - dimensional theory , massive particles neutral under the sm gauge group .",
    "thus , were it not for the lack of a stabilizing symmetry , any of these particles would be a natural candidate for dark matter .",
    "however , our results demonstrate that a lack of stability is not an insurmountable impediment to such fields serving as dark matter _ collectively _ , rather than individually .",
    "this is an exciting prospect , for it provides a novel way of addressing the dark - matter question in theories with extra dimensions .",
    "furthermore , our model also demonstrates that realizing a viable dynamical dark - matter ensemble does not require an overly complicated dark sector , a large number of independent mass scales , or an excessive degree of fine - tuning .",
    "indeed , the model presented here involves only three independent physical scales : the effective four - dimensional cutoff scale @xmath12 , the confinement scale @xmath11 , and the compactification scale @xmath13 .",
    "together , these three scales determine the mass spectrum and decay properties of the entire ensemble .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : axionsined ] , we briefly review the formalism for discussing axions and axion - like fields , beginning with the standard , four - dimensional case and then moving on to the generalized , five - dimensional bulk - axion case . in sect .",
    "[ sec : axiondecayrates ] , we calculate the decay widths of the kk modes of such a bulk axion - like field and investigate how these decay widths scale with the mass of the mode . in the process , we show that the decays of the lighter modes to sm fields experience a natural suppression , but that such decays nevertheless dominate over decays to other , lighter bulk fields in the theory . in sect .",
    "[ sec : production ] , we examine the various mechanisms through which a population of axion modes may be generated in the early universe , and demonstrate that the abundances generated for those modes by misalignment production are indeed balanced against their decay widths in precisely the manner required for dynamical dark matter . in sect .",
    "[ sec : abundances ] , we examine the collective properties of the ensemble of axion kk modes . we show that such an ensemble can collectively reproduce the observed dark - matter relic density given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegawmap ] ) , and that it possesses the appropriate equation of state to be regarded as dark matter . in sect .",
    "[ sec : constraints ] , we summarize the experimental , astrophysical , and cosmological constraints on scenarios involving bulk axions in large , flat extra dimensions . we demonstrate that these constraints can be satisfied in a model which also simultaneously yields the correct total relic abundance  in other words , that our model truly constitutes a viable model of dynamical dark matter .",
    "finally , in the conclusions , we summarize the results of the previous sections and discuss several further directions for future investigation .    as we have indicated , this paper is the second part of a two - part series that began with ref .",
    "consequently , we shall assume that the reader is familiar with the ideas , notation , and conventions established in ref .",
    "@xcite in what follows .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the model for dynamical dark matter that we shall consider in this paper is a model in which the kk excitations of a bulk axion constitute the dark - matter ensemble . in this section , therefore , we briefly review the formalism relevant for describing the dynamics of axions in four or more dimensions .",
    "we begin with a brief summary of the relevant properties of the four - dimensional qcd axion ( more detailed reviews of which may be found , , in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and then discuss how this formalism can be generalized to a broader class of axions and axion - like fields . finally , we summarize the formalism for embedding such fields in the bulk in theories with extra dimensions .      the qcd axion emerges as a consequence of the peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism  @xcite , a mechanism which provides an elegant , dynamical solution to the strong cp problem .",
    "the strong cp problem arises due to the non - trivial vacuum structure of qcd .",
    "specifically , the qcd lagrangian can in principle contain an additional term @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the @xmath16 coupling , @xmath17 is a numerical factor of @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the field - strength tensor for the gluon field , and @xmath20 is its dual .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the strong - interaction theta - angle and @xmath24 is the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix . in principle",
    ", @xmath21 can take any value .",
    "however , experimental bounds on the electric dipole moment @xmath25 of the neutron serve to constrain @xmath21 .",
    "the most stringent limit is currently @xmath26  e  cm  @xcite , which translates into a bound @xmath27 while there is , in principle , no problem with @xmath21 taking so small a value , there is no particular reason why it should be so small .",
    "this fine - tuning issue is what is commonly referred to as the strong cp problem .    in the peccei - quinn solution to the strong cp problem",
    ", the effective @xmath21-parameter associated with the gluon field relaxes to zero dynamically as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of an anomalous , global @xmath28 symmetry , usually dubbed @xmath29 , at some high scale @xmath30 .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of this @xmath29 symmetry implies the presence of a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson : a real pseudoscalar commonly known as the qcd axion  @xcite , which necessarily interacts with the gluon field via the lagrangian @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the axion field .",
    "furthermore , this pseudoscalar may also have interactions with the other fields of the sm .",
    "the presence of the anomalous @xmath29 symmetry in the high - scale theory determines the effective lagrangian for these interactions ( at leading order ) to be @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the sm fermions and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are dimensionless coefficients .",
    "these coefficients depend on the charge assignments of the sm fields ( and potentially of additional fields in the theory as well ) under @xmath29 , and are therefore substantially more model - dependent than @xmath17 .    at high temperatures ,",
    "the axion field is effectively massless , as befits a nambu - goldstone boson ; however , it acquires a small , temperature - dependent mass @xmath37 at lower scales due to qcd instanton effects .",
    "a number of computations of this mass have been performed , and while the results depend to some extent on the assumptions and calculational techniques involved , @xmath37 is often assumed to have the rough form  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39  mev is the qcd confinement scale , @xmath40 is a numerical coefficient of @xmath41 , and @xmath17 is an @xmath18 numerical factor .    the fact that the axion necessarily couples to the gluon field implies that it will also have effective couplings to hadrons .",
    "the most important such couplings , phenomenologically speaking , are those of the axion to pions and nucleons .",

    "similarly , the coefficients for the interactions involving pions are given by @xmath49 where @xmath50  mev is the neutral pion mass , and @xmath51  mev is the pion decay constant .",
    "these hadronic couplings play an important role in constraining the parameter space of axion models .",
    "the qcd axion is the prototypical example of a light pseudoscalar field whose mass arises solely due to non - perturbative effects associated with instanton dynamics , and whose interactions with the sm fields are highly suppressed .",
    "it is by no means the only example , however .",
    "indeed , a wide variety of additional particles possessing these same properties have appeared in the literature in a number of beyond - the - standard - model ( bsm ) contexts , and are often generically referred to as axion - like particles ( alps ) .",
    "one particularly well - motivated example is the model - independent axion  @xcite in string theory . since axions of this more general",
    "sort are , by and large , no less viable as dark - matter candidates than the qcd axion , it behooves us to extend our focus to encompass such fields as well .    for the remainder of this work ,",
    "then , we will use the term `` axion '' to refer to any pseudoscalar field whose mass is generated by the instanton dynamics associated with an arbitrary non - abelian gauge group @xmath10 .",
    "this gauge group could be the sm @xmath16 color group , as it is for the qcd axion , but alternatively it could be some additional group which either resides in a hidden sector , or else confines at a very high scale . as with the qcd axion",
    ", any axion we consider will be assumed to be a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson associated with the breaking of some global symmetry @xmath52 at a scale @xmath53 by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of some scalar field .",
    "the axion field is assumed to couple to the field strength @xmath54 associated with @xmath10 via a term of the form @xmath55 where @xmath32 again denotes the axion field , @xmath56 is the coupling constant associated with @xmath10 , @xmath57 is the dual of @xmath58 , and @xmath17 is a model - dependent coefficient which parameterizes the strength of the effective interaction between the axion and the gauge fields .",
    "we will also assume that @xmath10 goes through a confining phase transition at some scale @xmath11 , and that a potential analogous to that appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : instantonpotential ] ) is thereby generated for @xmath32 .",
    "in other words , this general axion couples to @xmath10 in a manner completely analogous to that in which the qcd axion couples to the sm @xmath16 .",
    "it therefore follows that all of the qcd - axion formalism outlined above continues to hold for axions in the broader sense of the word , provided one makes the substitutions @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , , where appropriate .",
    "there is , however , one crucial physical distinction between axions in general and the qcd axion in specific : for general axions , the confinement scale @xmath11 is essentially a free parameter .",
    "the properties of such an axion are therefore far less constrained than those of a qcd axion , simply because the axion mass is not uniquely determined by @xmath53 alone .",
    "moreover , the vast majority of the experimental bounds on axions depend crucially on the charge assignments of the sm gauge fields under the global @xmath52 symmetry .",
    "for a generic axion , these charges need not have any relationship to the @xmath29 charge assignments for these fields",
    ". an important consequence of this is that a generalized axion need not couple directly to the gluon field at leading order .",
    "moreover , other scenarios could be realized in such a framework that can not arise for a qcd axion .",
    "for example , one can imagine a purely `` photonic '' axion which couples to the photon field at leading order , but not to the gluon field or to any of the sm fermions . in what follows",
    ", we will focus on several different concrete coupling scenarios .",
    "one of these will be such a photonic axion ; another will be a `` hadronic '' axion which couples to the gluon and photon fields , but not directly to any of the sm fermions . however , we note that numerous other possibilities exist , and that the laboratory , astrophysical , and cosmological constraints on any given model depend sensitively on the couplings between the axion and the fields of the sm .",
    "it is also worth noting that certain details of any scenario of this sort will depend on the details of the instanton dynamics associated with the particular gauge group @xmath10 in question .",
    "the scaling behavior of @xmath62 as a function of @xmath63 , for example , may not be identical to the scaling behavior quoted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : instantonmassthermal ] ) for qcd instantons .",
    "however , none of these details plays a crucial role in the dark - matter phenomenology of the our model",
    ". we will therefore assume for the remainder of this work that , except for the values of @xmath11 , @xmath56 , , the standard axion results derived in the context of qcd - instanton dynamics apply to @xmath10-instanton dynamics as well .",
    "having summarized the formalism applicable to a four - dimensional axion , we now consider how the situation changes when the axion in question is allowed to propagate in the extra - dimensional bulk of a theory with more than four dimensions . as was originally pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dynamics of such an axion is far richer than that of a purely four - dimensional axion , due both to the presence of an entire kk tower of axion excitations and to a non - trivial mixing between these excitations due to the presence of brane mass terms , which explicitly violate kk mode - number conservation . indeed , as we shall see , it is those kk excitations which will constitute the dark - matter ensemble in our model , and it is their mixing which gives this ensemble the appropriate properties to be a viable dynamical dark - matter candidate . of course scenarios involving large extra dimensions",
    "have many other attractive features as well : they provide a geometric interpretation of the hierarchy between the weak scale and the planck scale  @xcite , between the weak scale and the grand - unification scale  @xcite , and between the weak scale and the string scale  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a higher - dimensional axion field can be accommodated quite naturally in such a brane / bulk framework .",
    "indeed , while only gravity is required to propagate in the bulk , the propagation of sm - gauge - singlet fields there , including axions of all varieties , is , in a sense , almost expected .    in what follows",
    ", we present the setup for a generic axion field in the bulk .",
    "this parallels the setup for a qcd axion put forth in ref .  @xcite . for concreteness",
    ", we choose to focus on the case in which the axion is allowed to propagate in a single , large extra dimension compactified on a @xmath64 orbifold of radius @xmath65 , while the fields of the sm and the gauge fields associated with the additional symmetry group @xmath10 are confined to the brane located at @xmath66 .",
    "however , we emphasize that the setup described here can easily be extended to scenarios in which the axion in question is allowed to propagate in multiple extra dimensions , or in which the background geometry is more complicated  @xcite .    at scales below the weak scale but above the confinement scale @xmath11 , the effective action for a bulk axion in five dimensions takes the form @xmath67~.\\ ] ] here , we have divided the brane - localized terms in the lagrangian into two parts .",

    "the second , @xmath69 , contains the interaction terms involving the brane - localized fields and the five - dimensional axion .",
    "this second piece is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath15 are the respective couplings for @xmath72 and @xmath16 color , and @xmath53 is the fundamental five - dimensional scale associated with the breaking of @xmath52 ( the analogue of the peccei - quinn scale @xmath30 in ref .",

    "by contrast , in a ltr cosmology with @xmath283 , much of the relevant dynamics will occur while the universe is still dominated by coherent oscillations of the inflaton field .",
    "such a cosmological modification can have profound effects on axion dynamics , even in the case of a four - dimensional axion  @xcite .",

    "having now set the cosmological tableaux , let us begin our discussion of axion production in the early universe . a number of production mechanisms can , in principle , contribute significantly to the axion relic density . in generic models ,",
    "three such mechanisms typically tend to provide the dominant contribution to the relic density of any individual axion field .",
    "one of these mechanisms is thermal production via the interactions of the @xmath101 with the sm fields in the radiation bath .",
    "the other two are non - thermal in nature and can generate a population of cold axions .",
    "these are misalignment production and production from the decays of topological defects ( in particular , cosmic strings ) associated with the breaking of the global @xmath52 symmetry .",
    "we begin with a discussion of thermal production .",
    "a number of processes can contribute appreciably to thermal axion production in the early universe , depending of course on the magnitudes of the couplings between the axion in question couples to the sm particles . among hadronic processes , @xmath289 , @xmath290 , @xmath291 , ,",
    "dominate for @xmath292 , while pion - axion conversion off nuclei ( including all processes of the form @xmath293 , where @xmath294 ) and the purely pionic process @xmath295 dominate at lower temperatures .",

    "these @xmath101 can therefore be considered effectively massless at such temperatures . in this massless limit",
    ", the rate for each of the axion - production processes enumerated above ( except for the inverse - decay process , which is generally sub - leading ) takes the rough , parametric form @xmath297 in other words , since kinematic distinctions between states for which @xmath296 are unimportant , the dependence of their production rates on @xmath102 occurs primarily through the coupling factor @xmath298 .",
    "this factor too is effectively independent of @xmath102 when @xmath299 ; hence , at a given temperature @xmath63 , any @xmath101 with a mass @xmath102 in the range @xmath300 will be produced at essentially the same rate .",
    "moreover , production rates actually _ increase _ with increasing @xmath102 for those modes with masses @xmath301 .",
    "this means that at a given temperature @xmath63 , the heavier @xmath101 in this mass range will actually be produced from the thermal bath at an equal or higher rate than the lighter @xmath101  at least until @xmath102 becomes comparable with @xmath63 , and their production rates are boltzmann suppressed .",
    "since @xmath133 also increases with @xmath102 , the less stable states will be thermally produced at an equal or higher rate than the more stable ones .",
    "such a relationship is clearly undesirable in models of dynamical dark matter .",
    "moreover , the majority of light axions produced through interactions with the thermal bath would be relativistic at the time of production , and therefore not cold .    from these considerations ,",
    "we conclude that if an ensemble of axion kk modes is to constitute the majority of the dark - matter relic density , thermal production must contribute only a negligible fraction of the total relic abundance of each @xmath101 , with the remainder of that abundance generated through non - thermal means .",
    "this requirement places a non - trivial constraint on scenarios of this sort , a detailed analysis of which appears in ref .",
    ". we will defer the discussion of how this constraint restricts the parameter space of our model until sect .",
    "[ sec : constraints ] . for the moment",
    ", we simply note that this constraint exists , and proceed to discuss non - thermal mechanisms for axion production .",
    "note , however , that in traditional models of kk dark - matter ( either single - component  @xcite or multi - component  @xcite ) , in which the dark - matter candidates are stable , thermal freeze - out can be a viable production method for generating relic abundances .",
    "one method in which a non - thermal population of axions may be generated in the early universe is production via the decay of cosmic strings associated with the broken global @xmath52 symmetry .",
    "however , this mechanism can contribute significantly to axion production only if @xmath302 , where @xmath303 is the value of the hubble parameter during inflation , so that those cosmic strings are not inflated away . since the value of @xmath303 is relatively unconstrained , and since astrophysical and cosmological constraints will turn out to require @xmath12 to be quite large , in the rest of this paper , we shall assume that @xmath304 .",
    "we will therefore not consider axion production from @xmath52 string decay .",
    "however , it should be noted that in other scenarios ( or in other regions of parameter space ) , axions produced via cosmic - string decay could have important phenomenological consequences in dynamical dark - matter models , and this production mechanism therefore deserves further study .",
    "finally , we turn to non - thermal axion production via the misalignment mechanism .",
    "as we shall see , this turns out to be the most promising axion - production mechanism from the perspective of dynamical dark matter .",
    "the basis of this mechanism is that at temperatures @xmath305 , the instanton - induced contribution to the axion potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : instantonpotential ] ) effectively vanishes .",
    "this implies that the only contribution to the axion mass matrix at such high temperatures are the diagonal contributions from the kk masses : no mixing occurs , and consequently the mass eigenstates are merely the kk eigenstates @xmath103 .",
    "while the potential for each @xmath103 with @xmath306 is therefore non - vanishing , due to the presence of the kk masses , and is minimized at @xmath307 , the potential for the zero mode @xmath308 vanishes . in the absence of a potential for @xmath308 , there is no preferred vacuum expectation value @xmath309 which minimizes @xmath310 ; indeed , any @xmath311 is as good as any other .",
    "this means that when the @xmath52 symmetry is broken , the value of @xmath309 within a given domain is essentially arbitrary .",
    "thus , immediately after this phase transition occurs , one would expect to find a set of domains , each with a different homogeneous background value for the axion field , which would generically be expected to be @xmath312 , but could in principle be smaller .",
    "our ignorance of this initial value of @xmath309 is commonly parameterized by a `` misalignment angle '' @xmath313 , so that the initial conditions at the time at which the @xmath52 symmetry is broken can be written as  @xcite @xmath314 indeed , as was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , this initial condition follows from @xmath52 invariance , which manifests itself here in the form of a five - dimensional shift symmetry under which @xmath315 , where @xmath316 is a constant .    at lower temperatures , however , the situation changes , as instanton effects generate a brane mass @xmath62 for the bulk axion . here ,",

    "in this basis , the time - evolution of each field @xmath101 is governed by an equation of the form @xmath325 in arriving at this expression , we have used the fact that within an rd or md era , @xmath321 is approximately given by the relation @xmath326 , where @xmath327 exact , closed - form solutions for @xmath101 and @xmath328 , given an evolution equation of this form , _ do _ exist , and we present these solutions in the appendix .",

    "since it is now clear which regions of model parameter space are suitable for dynamical dark matter , we will not perform a general survey of @xmath476 over the entirety of that parameter space , as we did with @xmath478 and @xmath477 , but instead focus on the preferred regions indicated in eq .",

    "this , in turn , requires knowledge of how our abundances and decay widths scale with @xmath102 . as in the previous subsection",

    "likewise , the decay width for a photonic axion is given by the expression in eq .",

    "( [ eq : wstar ] ) are given respectively by @xmath528 and @xmath529 while the power - law indices @xmath526 and @xmath527 are given by @xmath530 substituting these results into eq .",
    "( [ eq : wstar ] ) , we find that @xmath531    let us discuss the implications of these results .",
    "first , it was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that the effective equation - of - state parameter @xmath532 for any given dynamical dark - matter ensemble at any time @xmath533 will always fall within the range @xmath534 as long as @xmath535 .",
    "this makes such ensembles less dangerous from a phenomenological point of view .",
    "indeed , we see from the results above that this criterion is satisfied for both the large-@xmath102 and small-@xmath102 regimes in the bulk - axion model under consideration here .",
    "second , in order to convey a sense of the characteristic size of @xmath476 in the favored region of parameter space for dynamical dark matter given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : preferredregion ] ) , we note that for the choice of @xmath536  gev , @xmath416  gev , and @xmath230  tev , with @xmath537 , we find that @xmath538 for @xmath148 , while @xmath539 for @xmath149 . as these numbers are both extremely close to zero , we conclude that at present time our axion ensemble has an effective equation of state which can be legitimately interpreted as that of dark matter .",
    "thus our ensemble meets all three requirements for a self - consistent model of dynamical dark matter .",
    "in the previous section , we demonstrated that an ensemble of mixed kk excitations of a bulk axion field can collectively account for the observed relic abundance of dark matter in our universe .",
    "however , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to be a viable model of dynamical dark matter , the model must also comply with a variety of additional laboratory , astrophysical , and cosmological constraints .",
    "some of these constraints are intrinsic to any theory involving large extra dimensions , while others arise due to the physical effects of the axion field which propagates in the bulk of those dimensions .",
    "a number of analyses of such constraints exist in the literature  @xcite for the specific case in which the bulk axion in question is identified with the qcd axion and the fundamental , @xmath540-dimensional quantum - gravity scale is taken to be roughly @xmath541 .",
    "by contrast , in the present analysis , we are interested in a broader class of axions which are neither required to couple to the fields of the sm ( and in particular to hadrons ) in the same manner as a qcd axion , nor subject to the same strict relationship between the suppression scale for those couplings and the axion mass .",
    "moreover , our primary motivation is not to address the hierarchy problem , but to address the issue of what constitutes the non - baryonic dark matter in our universe . for these reasons",
    ", we will not focus exclusively on scenarios in which @xmath542 is at or near the tev scale , but also consider scenarios with much larger @xmath542 . as a consequence ,",
    "exclusion limits on the parameter space of the more general axion scenarios considered here can differ quite significantly from those presented in previous studies , and thus warrant reexamination .",
    "we begin our summary of the applicable constraints on our model with a brief synopsis of those limits which arise generically in theories with large , flat extra dimensions and which do not depend on the presence or properties of the bulk axion field . for the most part , these limits ,",
    "an overview of which was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , tend to derive from the non - observation of physical effects related to the dynamics of kk gravitons .",
    "these limits take many forms .",
    "first , there is the direct lower bound on @xmath13 quoted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : minimummc ] ) from experimental limits on modifications of newton s law at short distances due to kk - graviton exchange  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a number of constraints arise as a consequence of the production of these particles in the early universe  @xcite . as discussed in sect .  [",
    "sec : production ] , these cosmological constraints can collectively be addressed by positing that the universe underwent a late period of cosmic inflation with a reheating temperature @xmath283 .",
    "thus , by adopting an ltr cosmology with a reheating temperature of this order , as we have done , we automatically ensure that a large number of these model - independent constraints are satisfied .",
    "a number of additional constraints on theories of this sort can be derived from observational limits on kk - graviton production in astrophysical sources , such as stars  @xcite and supernovae  @xcite .",
    "the most stringent of these constraints are currently those resulting from gravitationally trapped kk gravitons in the halos of neutron stars either decaying to photons or serving as a heat source for the stars themselves . in the case of @xmath543 flat extra dimensions with equal radii compactified on an @xmath120-torus , these limits supersede the limit on @xmath13 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : minimummc ] ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath544 , the bound is @xmath545  gev , while for @xmath546 , one finds @xmath547  gev  @xcite .",
    "however , if the radii of the extra dimensions differ from one another , or if the compactification manifold is not toroidal , these bounds can be considerably weaker .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that the axion propagates only within some number @xmath548 of the additional dimensions , @xmath549 . in other words ,",
    "the axion could be confined to a @xmath550-dimensional brane within the bulk . in this case , the effective , four - dimensional scales @xmath12 and @xmath136 are related to the fundamental , higher - dimensional scales @xmath53 and @xmath542 in completely different ways : @xmath551 the upshot , then , is that nave limits on @xmath542 derived from kk - graviton dynamics under the assumption of toroidal compactification and equal radii do not necessarily translate in a straightforward manner into constraints on the mass scales relevant to the physics of a bulk axion .",
    "fortunately , the bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq : minimummc ] ) is universal and is not sensitive to the total number of extra dimensions , unless they are each of comparable size .",
    "we will therefore take this bound to be the lower limit on @xmath13 in the @xmath552 model under consideration here .",
    "we now turn to address those constraints which relate to the effects of the bulk axion itself .",
    "indeed , a number of considerations serve to constrain the properties of light exotic particles with suppressed couplings to sm fields .",
    "some of these constraints derive from observational limits on the production of such particles in astrophysical sources such as stars and supernovae ; others derive from limits on the decays of a cosmological population of such fields into sm fields ; and still others owe to direct experimental bounds from microwave - cavity experiments , helioscopes ,   a detailed analysis of the exclusion limits implied by these constraints on general bulk - axion scenarios will be presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we merely summarize the results and discuss their implications for a mixed kk tower of axions as a model of dynamical dark matter .    as we shall discuss further in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is convenient to separate the applicable constraints into four rough classes , based on the origin of the constraint and on the dynamics being probed",
    ". the first class of constraints which apply to scenarios of this sort are those related to the total present - day dark - matter relic abundance @xmath478 .",
    "most of these bounds have been addressed in previous sections , but it will be useful to recapitulate them here :    * the axion ensemble must yield an acceptable contribution to the present - day dark - matter relic density . while @xmath553 is permitted , provided some additional field or",
    "fields make up the deficit , values of @xmath478 in excess of the wmap upper bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegawmap ] ) are excluded .",
    "* at no time in the past may our ensemble overclose or prematurely matter - dominate the universe . *",
    "the present - day effective equation - of - state parameter @xmath476 for the ensemble must not deviate significantly from zero .",
    "* misalignment production must provide the dominant contribution to @xmath134 for all @xmath101 , and the population of hot axions generated via thermal production must be negligible .",
    "we therefore require that @xmath554 at all times after the end of cosmic inflation , where @xmath555 is the total production rate of axions from interactions with sm fields in the thermal bath .",
    "* we have also assumed that the population of axions generated from the decays of cosmic strings associated with the breaking of the global @xmath52 symmetry is small compared to the population generated by misalignment production .",
    "we therefore impose the requirement that @xmath556 , so that such strings are diluted away by inflation .",
    "* our model must respect current observational limits on isocurvature fluctuations from wmap  @xcite .",
    "the last of these constraints warrants additional discussion .",
    "non - adiabatic fluctuations  also known as isocurvature fluctuations  refer to fluctuations not in the total energy density ( which relates directly to spacetime curvature ) but rather in how that total energy density is distributed among different contributing fields ( including the collective contribution from the dark sector ) .",
    "such isocurvature fluctuations are tightly constrained by a combination of cmb observations , baryon - acoustic - oscillation ( bao ) measurements , and supernova data  @xcite .",
    "such fluctuations generically arise whenever a cosmological population of particles is produced in a manner such that its primordial density perturbations are uncorrelated with those of the inflaton field .",
    "indeed , limits on isocurvature fluctuations place severe constraints on the relic abundance of a standard qcd axion produced via vacuum misalignment  @xcite , so it might reasonably be assumed that such limits might play a significant role in constraining our model as well .",
    "it turns out , however , that our model satisfies the wmap constraints on non - adiabatic fluctuations far more easily than do standard axion dark - matter models .",
    "a detailed discussion of these constraints and how they apply to bulk - axion models of dynamical dark - matter will be presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the gist of the argument is as follows .",
    "although our dynamical dark - matter ensemble comprises a large number of individual components @xmath101 , the fact that @xmath475 implies that the individual abundance @xmath134 associated with each of these components is actually quite small . furthermore , the underlying five - dimensional nature of our kk axion tower guarantees that the primordial density fluctuations for each @xmath101 are all determined by the fluctuations @xmath557 of the _ same _ initial misalignment angle @xmath313 .",
    "for these reasons , the expected magnitude for isocurvature fluctuations in our model turns out to be no greater than it is in models in which misalignment production causes a single four - dimensional field to carry the complete dark - matter abundance .",
    "moreover , if one assumes a gaussian distribution for @xmath557 , it is straightforward to demonstrate  @xcite that @xmath558 .",
    "thus , all that is required is that @xmath559 within our preferred regions of parameter space .",
    "however , as discussed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : preferredregion ] ) , the phenomenologically preferred scale for @xmath12 in our model is roughly @xmath560 . for @xmath12 at or around this scale , it turns out that current constraints on isocurvature fluctuations can be satisfied , provided that @xmath561  gev .",
    "such a scale for @xmath303 is easy to realize in traditional cosmological scenarios , and is even more natural in ltr cosmologies wherein the reheating temperature is @xmath562 .",
    "thus , in our model , it is not difficult to satisfy current isocurvature bounds while simultaneously obtaining a total relic abundance @xmath475 .",
    "the underlying reason why our model easily evades these non - adiabatic constraints is that within the preferred region of parameter space in eq .",
    "( [ eq : preferredregion ] ) , the five - dimensional axion in our model is not the standard qcd axion .",
    "in particular , we see that the scale @xmath11 is significantly larger than @xmath563 .",
    "our model is thus freed from the implicit parametric dependence on @xmath563 which afflicts more traditional models of axion dark matter , and allows the corresponding non - adiabatic fluctuations to have a much smaller scale .",
    "a second class of constraints comprises those observational limits on processes in which axions are produced via their interactions with the fields of the sm and then subsequently detected via those same interactions .",
    "these include :    * limits from helioscope experiments , such as cast  @xcite , which search for axions produced by interactions with sm particles in the sun via their `` conversion '' to photons in the presence of a magnetic field . * limits from light - shining - through - walls ( lsw ) experiments ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a thorough review ) , including those by the bev and gammaev collaborations .",
    "the most stringent of these bounds is currently that from cast ; we shall therefore take the cast bound as representative of this class .    the physical processes to which this second class of limits applies are all subject to a particular effect which arises universally in models with both brane and bulk mass terms .",
    "this is the phenomenon of decoherence discussed in refs .",
    "this decoherence phenomenon can substantially suppress the cross - sections for such processes in our model , and thereby significantly weaken the bounds on @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath11 .",
    "to summarize , the cross - section for any process in which axions are produced at some time @xmath564 and then subsequently detected at a later time @xmath254 is given by @xmath565 where @xmath566 is the number of modes contributing in the sum and where @xmath567 is the detection probability at time @xmath254 .",
    "this latter quantity is given in the relativistic limit by  @xcite @xmath568~ ,    \\label{eq : poft}\\ ] ] where @xmath569 is the initial momentum of the axion .",
    "for any reasonable choice of model parameters , the sum in the second term decoheres on time scale so rapid as to be effectively instantaneous  @xcite . as a result , @xmath570 is suppressed , relative to the nave expectation , by an additional factor of @xmath571 . this effect",
    "considerably weakens the constraints in this class .",
    "a third class of constraints can be derived from processes in which axions are produced via their interactions with sm fields but not subsequently detected .",
    "instead , the presence of the axions is made manifest by their ability to carry away momentum and energy from a given system .",
    "these constraints include :    * observational limits on the energy loss in supernovae , and , in particular , on the fraction of the energy released by sn1987a in the form of light exotic fields  @xcite .",
    "* limits related to the effects of energy dissipation by axions on stellar lifetimes .",
    "the most stringent such limits currently come from observations of globular - cluster stars  @xcite , but similar limits have also been derived from constraints on the lifetimes or energy - loss rates of other astrophysical bodies ( , the sun  @xcite and white dwarfs  @xcite ) . * constraints from the absence of observed signals in channels such as @xmath572 and @xmath573 at particle colliders . in general , the constraints on axion production in these channels are analogous to the well - known constraints on kk - graviton production  @xcite . * limits on the branching fractions in particular exotic decay channels for certain hadrons  @xcite .",
    "the degree to which many of these limits constrain the parameter space of bulk - axion scenarios depends quite crucially on how the axion in question couples to the fields of the sm .",

    "a fourth and final class of constraints is related to the interactions and decays of a cosmological population of axions .",
    "depending on the cosmological epoch during which such decays occur , they can result in a number of potential signals , none of which have been observed to date .",
    "for example , these include :    * decays of cosmic axions which occur after the beginning of the bbn epoch ( at around @xmath575  s ) , but before last scattering ( at around @xmath576  s ) .",

    "the standard energy - dissipation limit from sn1987a  @xcite , for example , provides one of the most stringent limits on the parameter space of a qcd axion .",

    "@xcite  a departure which is enabled because @xmath11 is a free parameter in our model .",
    "_ thus , we conclude that within this region of parameter space , our bulk - axion model constitutes a viable , explicit model of dynamical dark matter .",
    "_    it should be stated that in addition to the limits discussed above , certain additional astrophysical bounds may also serve to constrain the parameter space of bulk - axion scenarios .",
    "for example , it has recently been shown  @xcite that limits on gamma - ray signals from decaying axions with masses of @xmath587 produced in supernovae can yield an even more stringent limit than that arising from energy - dissipation considerations alone . while these bounds are once again model - dependent ( and directly applicable only to cases in which the axion in question couples directly to hadrons with significant strength , and not to a photonic axion ) , they could provide an important additional constraint on the parameter space of dynamical dark - matter scenarios involving bulk axions .",
    "furthermore , it is also possible that comparable bounds could be obtained from an analysis of photo - emission limits and cooling - rate constraints from neutron stars , similar to that performed for kk gravitons in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is important to note that while additional bounds related to axion production in supernovae may serve to further constrain the parameter space of bulk - axion scenarios , these constraints can not rule out axion models of dynamical dark matter entirely .",
    "this is due to the fact that for any given choice of model parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath588 , the couplings of any mode for which @xmath149 to the sm fields will be suppressed by mixing effects , as discussed in ref .",
    "indeed , because we can reach deeply into the @xmath125 region , the magnitude of this coupling suppression can be quite significant .",
    "for example , for @xmath589 , we find that the first twenty axion mass eigenmodes have coupling suppressions @xmath590 .",
    "if the coupling suppressions are significant for those @xmath101 with masses in the `` dangerous '' range @xmath591  mev discussed above , such @xmath101 will be produced in supernovae at a negligible rate , and thus all supernova bounds on axion production can be evaded .",
    "this can be arranged by demanding that @xmath592  gev , so that all modes with masses @xmath593  gev are effectively in the small-@xmath102 regime .",
    "therefore , since @xmath478 is essentially independent of @xmath11 within our preferred region of parameter space , satisfying this condition is simply a matter of choosing a sufficiently large value for @xmath11 . indeed , setting @xmath536  gev in accord with eq .",
    "( [ eq : preferredregion ] ) , we find that all axion - production constraints from supernovae can be avoided for @xmath594 we emphasize that this rough bound is not a necessary condition for consistency with supernova data , but a sufficient one .",
    "furthermore , since the neutron - star cooling and photo - emission bounds on kk gravitons rest on the assumption that a population of gravitationally - bound particles of this sort was generated by the supernova whose core - collapse produced a given neutron star , any similar bound on axions would also cease to apply in this regime .",
    "we also note that since the fundamental scale @xmath53 is still roughly an order of magnitude larger than the value of @xmath11 required to satisfy this condition , given the input values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , no theoretical inconsistency results from positing a confinement scale of this order .    the fact that this coupling - suppression phenomenon is capable of rendering our model consistent with supernova bounds despite the large multiplicity of light modes attests to the importance of this effect in brane / bulk theories . a more detailed overview of this phenomenon and its physical implications will be provided in ref .",
    "the aim of this paper has been to present an explicit realization of the dynamical dark - matter framework presented in ref .  @xcite . to that end",
    ", we have shown that an ensemble consisting of the kk excitations of a light , axion - like field can indeed provide such a realization .",
    "indeed , we have shown that despite the fact that the masses , decay widths , and relic abundances of all of these particles are controlled by only three dimensionful parameters , the ensemble to which they give rise is simultaneously able to reproduce the observed value of @xmath8 and satisfy all applicable constraints from laboratory experiments , astrophysics , and cosmology .",
    "as such , this model provides a `` proof of concept '' for dynamical dark matter as a viable alternative framework for dark - matter physics .",
    "in addition , it also provides a method of addressing the dark - matter question which does not require the introduction of any additional stabilizing symmetry .",
    "many qualifications , extensions , and possible generalizations of our dynamical dark - matter framework were discussed at the end of ref .",
    "@xcite ; here , we shall restrict our attention to five points which are specific to the bulk - axion model presented in this paper .    * first",
    ", in this work , we have made use of the rapid - turn - on approximation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : heaviside ] ) in calculating the relic abundances of the @xmath101 . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : production ] , this approximation is well motivated , since the instanton - generated mass term @xmath62 falls rapidly with temperature when @xmath442 .",
    "furthermore , the primary results of this paper are essentially insensitive to this approximation .",
    "this is because the fields which contribute significantly to @xmath8 in regions of parameter space which yield a realistic dark - matter relic abundance begin oscillating only well after @xmath62 has already settled into its constant , late - time value .",
    "however , the relic abundance of any field which begins oscillating before @xmath62 takes this late - time value will , in general , depend on the details of how this mass evolves in time .",
    "the quantitative effect on the abundance of a single field has long been appreciated  @xcite , but in our model , the effects are more complicated and more subtle because we have a coupled system of mixed scalars with different masses and therefore different oscillation times .",
    "it would be interesting to examine how a more rigorous treatment of the turn - on of @xmath62 would affect @xmath453 and @xmath454 in situations in which these quantities are sensitive to the time - dependence of this brane - mass term .",
    "such a study would have important implications for more general scenarios involving other kinds of light bulk scalars .",
    "indeed , the relationship between the size of the brane - mass term for such scalars and the time at which that brane mass is dynamically generated may differ significantly from the relationship which holds for axions . *",
    "second , as alluded to in sect .",
    "[ sec : constraints ] , it may be possible to further test or constrain the parameter space of bulk - axion models of dynamical dark matter in a number of ways .",
    "we have already mentioned one potential constraint which derives from limits on high - energy photons resulting from the decays of axions produced in supernovae  @xcite .",
    "other considerations also merit investigation .",
    "for example , a detailed analysis of the limits imposed by bbn on scenarios involving multiple decaying fields with different lifetimes and abundances could provide important constraints on dynamical dark - matter models in general .",
    "in addition , other considerations , such as limits on mass loss and decreases in the dark - matter density in the halos of dwarf galaxies  @xcite , could also be used to constrain dynamical dark - matter models . indeed ,",
    "while a number of standard constraints on individual unstable relic particles in the early universe have been revisited in a dynamical dark - matter context  @xcite , it would be interesting to see how other constraints would apply in this context as well .",
    "* third , we note that we have not specified a particular model of inflation as part of the cosmological context for our model .",
    "indeed , other than requiring a low reheating temperature @xmath595 , we have remained largely agnostic about the details of the inflationary model , the form of the inflaton potential , or even the scale @xmath303 .",
    "for the most part , our model does not depend on these particulars .",
    "however , certain consistency conditions do place meaningful restrictions on the set of inflationary scenarios with which our model is compatible .",
    "one such condition can be derived from the fact that vacuum fluctuations during inflation generically give rise to a background value @xmath596 for any scalar @xmath272 with a mass @xmath597 , where @xmath598 is the duration of inflation .",
    "this implies that the relationship between the mass @xmath102 and initial energy density @xmath349 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoinitcondits ] ) in our model is truly valid only for the lighter @xmath101 in a given tower  , those for which @xmath599 . by contrast , any heavier @xmath101 which still satisfy @xmath600 receive the leading contributions to their background values from vacuum fluctuations during inflation , and thus effectively acquire an initial abundance @xmath601 . in typical scenarios ,",
    "we expect @xmath602 , where @xmath603 is the number of @xmath71-foldings of inflation . the results for @xmath453 derived in sect .",
    "[ sec : abundances ] therefore remain consistent , provided that @xmath604 . indeed , since @xmath605  gev within the preferred region of parameter space specified in eq .",
    "( [ eq : preferredregion ] ) , we see that @xmath606 is certainly not inconsistent with our model and is in fact even expected . however , this condition on @xmath303 has non - trivial implications for inflationary models . while a low scale for @xmath303 is certainly not excluded ( see , , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , extremely small values of @xmath303 tend to be rather non - generic  @xcite among typical classes of inflationary potentials , and thus require either substantial tuning or careful construction . indeed ,",
    "any consistent inflationary model of this sort must give rise to density fluctuations on a scale consistent with constraints from cmb data  @xcite , such as those on the spectral index @xmath607 , and must also satisfy other observational constraints .",
    "the development of explicit inflationary scenarios of this sort is therefore an interesting topic for future investigation .",
    "* fourth , we note that while we have chosen in this paper to focus on the case in which the ensemble of fields reproducing @xmath8 are the kk excitations of a bulk axion field , such a field is by no means unique in possessing the characteristics necessary to give rise to such an ensemble . indeed , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , much of the analysis presented here pertains to any light bulk scalar for which a mass term is dynamically generated via its interactions with brane - localized fields .",
    "furthermore , for a generic bulk scalar , the relationship between the time at which this mass term is dynamically generated and the magnitude of this mass term itself may differ from that which relates @xmath334 and @xmath124 for a bulk axion . as a result ,",
    "much more freedom may exist for constructing viable models within the dynamical dark - matter framework . for example , light moduli could also , in principle , provide a viable model of dynamical dark matter .",
    "* finally , we emphasize that the presence of additional axion - like fields is fairly generic , and perhaps even expected , in many theoretically motivated scenarios for physics beyond the standard model ( see , , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover , it has even been argued that many of these axion - like fields are likely to be light  @xcite .",
    "thus , the discovery of a vast ensemble of axion - like particles could provide important insight into what physics looks like at high scales .",
    "indeed , if many of these axions have relatively small masses , we find ourselves in the intriguing situation in which most of the matter in the universe is simultaneously both light and dark .",
    "our goal in this work has been to provide an existence proof for dynamical dark matter  , to provide a model in which lifetimes are balanced against abundances in such a way that the ensemble of dark - matter particles successfully reproduces @xmath8 while at the same time satisfying all phenomenological constraints . as we have seen in this paper ,",
    "our bulk - axion model indeed passes this test . in one sense ,",
    "our model does so in the most interesting way possible : with @xmath125 ( signifying that our tower of axion kk modes is highly mixed ) and with a tower fraction @xmath454 which is significantly different from zero . in another sense , however , this model is fairly conservative : those modes which contribute most to @xmath478 turn out to be rather long - lived , and likewise our numerical result for @xmath476 within the preferred region of parameter space turns out to be rather close to zero . indeed , at first glance",
    ", one might suspect that these latter properties are in fact generic for dynamical dark - matter models , or even that such models are therefore really no different from traditional dark - matter models in terms of their abundance and stability requirements .",
    "this is not the case , however , for the balancing of lifetimes against abundances  which is the hallmark of the dynamical dark - matter framework  is precisely why this framework does _ not _ require such a degree of stability , much less the existence of a stabilizing symmetry . while certain accidental features of our bulk - axion model result in a preferred region of parameter space which is somewhat conservative , we emphasize that these features are not generic even to theories with bulk scalars , much less realistic dynamical dark - matter models as a whole . note , for example , that a particular relationship exists in bulk - axion models between the mass @xmath102 of a given kk mass eigenstate @xmath101 , the strength of its effective coupling to sm fields , and the overall magnitude of its relic abundance @xmath134 through the dependence of these quantities on @xmath12 . even for other bulk scalars ( , moduli ) , these relationships do not necessarily hold .",
    "there is therefore no reason to expect dynamical dark - matter models based around such fields to be as conservative as the axion model we have presented here .    in this connection",
    ", there is an even more important point that deserves emphasis . in dynamical dark - matter scenarios ,",
    "we have no single characteristic decay width @xmath608 nor abundance @xmath609 , but rather an entire _ spectrum _ of widths @xmath133 and abundances @xmath134 . this therefore begs the fundamental question : if our `` proof of concept '' model presented here is to be viewed as somewhat conservative , how far from the conservative limit can we go ?    at first glance , one might try to answer this question by attempting to determine , for each time @xmath254 during the evolution of the universe , the maximum abundance @xmath610 that a given component in a dark - matter ensemble may have if it has a lifetime @xmath611 .",
    "in other words , given the entirety of the cosmological constraints from bbn , cmb distortions , , there exists a _ function _",
    "@xmath612 which describes the maximum abundance any dark - matter constituent may have as a function of its decay width",
    ". it might therefore seem that knowledge of this function would uniquely determine the full range of possibilities inherent in our dynamical dark - matter framework .",
    "such an approach to answering our fundamental question is , in a sense , already a departure from the usual manner of approaching dark - matter physics .",
    "however , even the notion of such a function @xmath613 relies too strongly on a single - particle perspective .",
    "one of the critical features of our dynamical dark - matter framework is that it involves a vast _ ensemble _ of dark - matter components",
    ". some of these components might decay earlier in cosmological evolution , while others might decay later . as a result ,",
    "the maximum abundance that a given component may have if it decays on a characteristic time scale @xmath614 will itself be directly affected not only by the abundances of all of the other components with earlier characteristic decay times @xmath615 , but even the components with @xmath616 . moreover , as we have seen , most phenomenological constraints on dark - matter decays are sensitive not merely to what happens at a specific moment in time , but to the integrated effects of such decays over a broad range of time scales .",
    "in other words , our dynamical dark - matter framework teaches us that astrophysical and cosmological constraints do not lead to a single function @xmath613 , but rather a more subtle set of intertwined constraints on lifetimes and abundances across our entire dark - matter ensemble as a whole .",
    "clearly , this issue has not been studied in any detail in the literature .",
    "however , it is readily apparent that this is indeed the only proper way in which one should express constraints on particle decays from a generic dark sector . viewed from this perspective , then , the existence of even one viable dynamical dark - matter model  no matter how `` conservative '' it might be  gives us strong motivation to re - examine cosmological and astrophysical constraints within this framework .",
    "indeed , it is only in this way that we will be able to fully explore our dynamical dark - matter framework , and understand its full range of phenomenological possibilities .",

    "<S> in a recent paper  @xcite , we introduced `` dynamical dark matter , '' a new framework for dark - matter physics , and outlined its underlying theoretical principles and phenomenological possibilities . unlike most traditional approaches to the dark - matter problem which hypothesize the existence of one or more stable dark - matter particles , our dynamical dark - matter framework is characterized by the fact that the requirement of stability is replaced by a delicate balancing between cosmological abundances and lifetimes across a vast ensemble of individual dark - matter components . </S>",
    "<S> this setup therefore collectively produces a time - varying cosmological dark - matter abundance , and the different dark - matter components can interact and decay throughout the current epoch . while the goal of our previous paper was to introduce the broad theoretical aspects of this framework , </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of the current paper is to provide an explicit model of dynamical dark matter and demonstrate that this model satisfies all collider , astrophysical , and cosmological constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this paper therefore constitute an `` existence proof '' of the phenomenological viability of our overall dynamical dark - matter framework , and demonstrate that dynamical dark matter is indeed a viable alternative to the traditional paradigm of dark - matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical dark matter must therefore be considered alongside other approaches to the dark - matter problem , particularly in scenarios involving large extra dimensions or string theory in which there exist large numbers of particles which are neutral under standard - model symmetries .    .7ex    </S>",
