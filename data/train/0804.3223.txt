    "the interpretation of infrared measurements of star forming galaxies rests on an understanding of the properties of the dust producing the emission .",
    "in addition , the dependence of dust properties on environment provides important clues to the dust composition and formation .",
    "an important constituent of the interstellar dust is large , aromatic molecules / grains whose emission often dominates the mid - infrared output of hii regions and galaxies @xcite .",
    "the aromatic features were first discovered in observations of planetary nebulae where a feature at 11.3  was broader than the observed atomic emission lines @xcite .",
    "the number of these features has grown to include many features with wavelengths between 3 and 18  @xcite .",
    "the strongest aromatics are seen at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , 12.7 , and 17.1  and all the aromatics have been identified with c - h and c - c bending and stretching modes of hydrocarbons containing aromatic rings @xcite . the shape and strength of the aromatics have been seen to vary in single sources @xcite , among various galactic sources @xcite , and among galaxies @xcite .",
    "a number of different materials have been proposed as the carriers of these features , including hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , quenched carbonaceous composites ( qcc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , coal @xcite , and nanodiamonds @xcite . the leading candidate material for the aromatics is pah molecules and they are often included in the modified `` astronomical pahs '' form in dust grain models @xcite .",
    "we refer to these features as the aromatic features to allow for discussions of the observations without making an assumption about the material that is responsible for them .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for a detailed discussion of these features .    the observed strengths of the aromatic features do not vary much in most normal luminosity galaxies with approximately solar metallicities @xcite or massive starbursts @xcite . the strength of these features do weaken significantly in active galactic nuclei @xcite and star bursting galaxies with fairly low metallicities @xcite .",
    "the variations seen in active galactic nuclei are not considered for this paper , which only discusses those clearly associated with nearby massive star formation ( e.g. , starburst galaxies and hii regions ) .",
    "observations with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) found that the strength of the aromatic features was correlated with a galaxy s metallicity ( probed by log(o / h)+12 ) and ionization ( probed by [ neiii]/[neii ] ) , but were unable to determine which was the dominant effect @xcite .",
    "the correlations are such that the aromatic features are weakest for low metallicities and high ionizations .",
    "if the correlation is better with metallicity than ionization , then this implies that the formation of the aromatics ( from the constituent atoms in circumstellar or interstellar environments ) happens less efficiently than that of small grains as the metallicity decreases . on the other hand ,",
    "if the better correlation is with ionization , then this implies that there is increased processing of the aromatic feature carriers ( modification and/or destruction in the immediate environment ) as the radiation field becomes harder . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the metallicity as a probe of the formation of aromatics from the constitute atoms and ionization as a probe of the processing of the aromatics in the immediate environment .",
    "the metallicity and ionization in massive star forming regions is roughly correlated making it nontrivial to determine which is the dominate correlation .",
    "observations with spitzer have refined the observational picture of the variations of the aromatic features among galaxies , but have yet to provide a clear picture of the origin of the variations .",
    "evidence that the aromatic features are absent at the lowest metallicities probed by starburst galaxies was provided by the irs ( infrared spectrograph ) spectrum of sbs  0335 - 052 which has a log(o / h)+12=7.2 @xcite . the weakness / absence of aromatic features at metallicities below",
    "log(o / h)+12=8.2 in a sample of starburst galaxies was shown by @xcite using irac ( infrared camera ) and mips ( multiband imaging photometry for spitzer ) photometry confirmed in a few cases with irs spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite studied a small sample of blue compact dwarf galaxies ( including sbs  0335 - 052 ) with irs spectroscopy and found similar correlations between aromatic feature equivalent width and metallicity or radiation field hardness .",
    "@xcite found that the equivalent width of the aromatic features did not vary significantly over a factor of 10 in [ neiii]/[neii ] for a sample of starburst galaxies . using the hii classified galaxies in the sings ( spitzer nearby galaxies survey ) sample @xcite found variations in the summed strength of the aromatic features when ratioed to the total ir flux with some indication of a threshold at log(o / h)+12=8.1 .",
    "the metallicity threshold in the aromatic feature strengths was confirmed by @xcite where the broadband spectra energy distributions ( seds ) of the sings galaxies were modeled .",
    "these models indicated a fairly abrupt reduction by a factor of three occurs in the fraction of pahs near a metallicity of log(o / h)+12 = 8.1 .",
    "all this variation among galaxies raises the question : do the aromatics vary significantly among hii regions in a single galaxy ?",
    "the study of the simpler environments of hii regions may also present a clearer picture of the cause of the aromatic feature variations as hii regions have much more homogeneous physical conditions than whole galaxies . the ideal galaxy to answer",
    "this question is the giant spiral galaxy m101 .",
    "m101 is a large ( @xmath1diameter ) , face - on spiral galaxy ( sabcd ) at a distance of 6.7  mpc @xcite .",
    "it has one of the largest metallicity gradients known with metallicities [ log(o / h ) + 12 ] ranging from 8.8 in the nucleus to 7.4 in an hii region 41  kpc from the center @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are high quality electron temperature and metallicity determinations for a sample of m101 hii regions with metallicities from 7.4 to 8.8 @xcite .",
    "this large apparent size , the numerous hii regions , the large metallicity gradient , and the high quality metallicity measurements make m101 ideal for studying the dependence of the aromatics on the local conditions , specifically metallicity and ionization .",
    "the high sensitivity and spatial resolution provided by all three instruments on spitzer allow individual hii regions in m101 to be studied in detail .",
    "targeted spectroscopic observations of a handful of hii regions and the nucleus were taken with the infrared spectrograph ( irs , * ? ? ?",
    "imaging of m101 was obtained with the infrared array camera ( irac , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0  and the multiband imaging photometry for spitzer ( mips , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 24 , 70 , and 160  . the irac and mips images allow the general behavior of the aromatics to be studied over the entire galaxy and the irs spectra allow for the behavior of the aromatics to be probed in detail for selected hii regions .",
    "past studies of m101 in the infrared have concentrated on radial gradients as the spatial resolution was not high enough to study any but the few brightest hii regions ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "preliminary results from the irac and mips images were presented by @xcite and from the irs spectroscopy in @xcite .",
    "this work focuses on the intense star forming hii regions in a single galaxy and is complementary to the spitzer program on starburst galaxies led by charles engelbracht @xcite which focuses on the properties whole galaxies undergoing intensive star formation .",
    "the irac images of m101 were obtained on 8 march 2004 .",
    "two maps were taken separated by a few hours to allow for asteroid rejection .",
    "each map consisted of @xmath2 tiles with 150offsets ( 1/2 the array width ) between tile positions in both array dimensions .",
    "each exposure was taken in high dynamic range ( hdr ) mode resulting in two images , one with a 10.4 sec exposure time and one with a 0.4 second exposure time .",
    "the images were reduced with the spitzer science center ( ssc ) pipeline s13.2.0 and combined using mopex program ( v030106 ) . as part of the mosaicking , overlapping regions of adjacent images were used to correct for bias drifts in each image .",
    "the calibration of the images was corrected to an infinite aperture ( true surface brightness units ) using the values given by @xcite .",
    "the final mosaics have exposure times of @xmath385 seconds / pixel and are shown in figure  [ fig_m101_fullres ] .",

    "two maps were taken separated by a few hours for asteroid rejection .",
    "each map consisted of 14 medium rate 0.75 degree scan legs with a cross scan offset of 148 .",
    "we used version 3.06 of the mips data analysis tool ( dat ) @xcite to do the basic processing and final mosaicking of the individual images .",
    "extra processing steps before mosaicking used programs written specifically to improve the reduction of large , well - resolved galaxies . at 24  the extra steps included readout offset correction , scan mirror dependent flat fields , array averaged background subtraction ( using a low order polynomial fit to the data in each scan leg but excluding m101 ) , and rejection of the 1st 5 images in each scan leg due to bias boost transients . at 70 and 160  the extra steps were a pixel dependent background subtraction for each map ( using a low order polynomial fit to the data in each scan leg , again excluding m101 ) and a spatial cosmic ray cleaning ( 160  only ) .",
    "the calibration of the mips bands was done using the latest , official factors @xcite .",

    "the data available for metallicities between log(o / h)+12 = 7.17.9 are not sufficient to probe these trends for such low metallicities .",
    "our result implies that the decrease in aromatic equivalent widths seen in regions of massive star formation ( e.g. , hii regions and starburst galaxies ) is primarily due to processing , not formation .",
    "this is not to say that formation does not play a role , but just that it is not the dominant effect .",
    "the finding of processing of the aromatic carriers is consistent with existing evidence that the 2175    extinction feature carrier is processed in regions of massive star formation .",
    "we found that the correlation of the aromatic equivalent widths with ii is not a single power law as has been proposed in previous works .",
    "instead the aromatic equivalent widths are constant till a threshold ii of @xmath30 and then decrease .",
    "this decrease is well fit with a power law .",
    "this more complex behavior is consistent with previous work @xcite and @xcite which probed a narrower range of ii and seemed to find conflicting results .",
    "only the large range in both ii and metallicity probed in this work and the companion work of @xcite allowed for the true nature of the aromatic feature variations to be revealed .",
    "the lack of a clear dependence of the ratio of different aromatic features to the 11.3 aromatic feature on ii calls into question either ionization or size selective destruction of pah molecules as the mechanism for the observed reduction in the aromatic equivalent width versus ionization .",
    "this might indicate a more solid material origin for the aromatics @xcite which dominate the global measurements of hii regions . or it might imply that the area of the pdr regions decreases with respect to the area of the small grain emission as the radiation field hardness ( and thus ionization ) increases .    this work is based on observations made with the _",
