    "while the general build - up of cosmic structures seems to be well described by hierarchical models of galaxy formation ( @xmath6cdm ) , the assembly of the baryonic mass on galactic scale still represents a weak point of the galaxy formation models .",
    "one of these difficulties consists in explaining the large population of extremely red objects ( r - k@xmath15 ) eros .",
    "this population is a mixture of early type galaxies ( etg ) and dusty star forming galaxies ( sfg ) .",
    "hierarchical models should reproduce the abundance of massive red galaxies at 1@xmath72 and the balance among the number of early type and obscured star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "mid / far - ir observations can play a key role in the study of this pupulation : such data can allow to disantangle between the early type and star forming phenomena and , in particular , mid - ir data allow to assess a more reliable estimate of stellar masses of eros , as they allow to sample the rest - frame near - ir emission . since the mid - ir observations are usually not available for large samples of eros , the rest frame h - k emission is extrapolated from the observed optical emission ( partially affected by extinction ) which is dominated by young stars ( @xmath30.5 - 1gyr ) , whose contribution to the near - ir emission ( dominated by older stars ) is negligible .",
    "as the eros are mainly composed of old stars , the reliability of stellar masses estimates is extremely uncertain . the way to provide the models with robust observational constraints passes through mid - ir observations of a large ( @xmath1100 ) , bright ( k@xmath319 ) and complete sample of eros .",
    "[ detection ]",
    "we selected a complete sample of @xmath0150 eros ( r - k@xmath15 ) at k@xmath319 over two well separated fields ( s7 and s2 ) of the munics survey @xcite .",
    "this area ( @xmath0 420 arcmin@xmath4 ) and the redshift range ( 0.8@xmath3z@xmath32 ) covered by our sample imply a volume larger than 106 mpc@xmath8 .",
    "munics provides multiband information ( b , v , r , i , j , k ) down to vega limiting magnitudes 25 , 24 , 23 , 21 , 19.5 and photometric redshifts @xcite .",
    "we have imaged this area with the akari telescope in n3 ( 3.4 @xmath5 m ) , n60 ( 65 @xmath5 m ) and wl ( 150 @xmath5 m ) down to 12 @xmath5jy in the n3 filter .",
    "this value is shallower by a factor @xmath0 2 respect to what expected on the basis of akari exposure time calculator , calculated in order to detect in this passband all the eros present in the field . in this work we present the preliminary analysis made on the n3 images of s7 field ( see fig . [ detection ] , left panel ) , where 65 eros are present .",
    "we searched for the nearest mid - ir object to identify the n3 counterparts of our selected eros .",
    "[ detection ] ( right panel ) shows the mid - ir optical distance distribution of the n3 counterparts .",
    "as it can be seen , most of identifications are found within 3.5which is consistent with the combined astrometric errors . beyond this distance",
    "the distribution is flat as expected for spurious identifications .",
    "thus , we identify 41/65 eros with a success rate of 63% and a contamination rate of 7% .",
    "we have calculated the contamination rate , producing several mock catalogs by randomly shifting the eros positions and searching for the nearest akari identification within 3.5 .",
    "[ spectra ]",
    "we performed a sed fitting at the fixed photometric redshifts running the hyperz @xcite routine to assess the spectral type of our 41 identified eros .",
    "we used a template with an exponentially declining sfr with e - folding time ( @xmath9=0.1gyr ) and a@xmath10 @xmath30.2 to describe the early type galaxies and a constant star formation model with a@xmath11 @xmath32.0 to describe star forming galaxies .",
    "the templates have been built with the charlot & bruzual ( cb 2007 @xcite ) code , assuming the chabrier initial mass function and solar metallicity .",
    "the spectral type is assigned by the fit with the lowest reduced @xmath12 value .",
    "35 objects ( 85% of the whole sample ) were classified as etgs ( early type galaxies ) , while the remaining 6 ( 15% ) as sfgs ( star forming galaxies ) .",
    "the choice of a@xmath13 for the etgs implies that these galaxies can be reddened only by old ages ( and not by dust ) , preventing any degeneration . in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ( left panel ) we show an example of etg and sfg galaxy , respectively .",
    "we stress that part of the sfg component can be misclassified by the routine , thus explaining their low number . in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ( right panel ) we show the j - k vs. r - k colours of our sample .",
    "the solid line r - k = @xmath14(j - k ) + 0.05 represent the border between passively evolving and star forming galaxies @xcite . also plotted the evolutionary tracks for etgs ( blu line ) and sfgs ( red line ) in the redshift range 0.8@xmath3z@xmath32 .",
    "our classification broadly agrees with the mannucci plot , but as we may notice , a considerable number of galaxies populate the area very close to the partition line . in particular while none of the sfg we classified fall in the etg zone , some of the etgs fall in the sfg zone , confirming the hypothesis of an overestimate of the etg class of objects .",
    "we calculated the stellar mass for each galaxy from the best fitting model , following the equation : @xmath15    where d@xmath16 is the luminosity distance , b is a normalization factor as output of hyperz and m@xmath17 is the integral of the sfr of the model at the age fitted by the routine . the mass calculated result to be an overestimate of the real mass locked in stars , as we do not take into account the so - called _ return fraction _ ,",
    "i.e. the gas processed into stars and returned to the ism .    in fig [ densityplot ]",
    "we show the evolution in @xmath18 of the stellar mass density compared with other values in the literature .",
    "we obtained a stellar mass density @xmath19 for the etg class .",
    "if we compare this value with the one obtained locally integrating the k  band luminosity function of the early type galaxies @xcite , we can conclude that * there is no evolution till z @xmath0 1.3 in the stellar mass density of the etg population , constraining the assembly of such objects to @xmath202 . *    we notice that our results are consistent with other literature values , although the authors we compare with do not refer to the same selection criteria . in particular cimatti et al .",

    "in fact there is no evidence of significant evolution in the stellar mass density of the most massive galaxies , in contrast with hierarchical models ( e.g. @xcite ) which predict that most ( @xmath23% ) of the high mass etgs should complete their growth at @xmath24 ."
