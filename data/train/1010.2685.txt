    "<S> we present the setup and test of a transportable clock laser at 698  nm for a strontium lattice clock . </S>",
    "<S> a master - slave diode laser system is stabilized to a rigidly mounted optical reference cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the setup was transported by truck over 400  km from braunschweig to dsseldorf , where the cavity - stabilized laser was compared to a stationary clock laser for the interrogation of ytterbium ( 578  nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> only minor realignments were necessary after the transport . </S>",
    "<S> the lasers were compared using a ti : sapphire frequency comb as a transfer oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> the generated virtual beat showed a combined linewidth below 1  hz ( at 1156  nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transport back to braunschweig did not degrade the laser performance , as was shown by interrogating the strontium clock transition .    </S>",
    "<S> optical clocks based on trapped cold atoms are now outperforming the best microwave clocks , thus enabling new studies and applications . </S>",
    "<S> operated in space and on the ground at different locations , they could enable relativistic geodesy and improved fundamental physics tests @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> reliable and rugged optical clocks with high stability and accuracy are therefore an important need . </S>",
    "<S> so far , high - performance cold atom optical clocks are still bulky laboratory setups that can not easily be transported </S>",
    "<S> . therefore developments towards transportable optical clocks are required and have been initiated @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most critical parts concerning transportability is the optical reference cavity that is used as a flywheel to ensure a high short - term frequency stability of the interrogation laser between the atom interrogation cycles . to achieve an optical linewidth of the clock laser in the range of one hertz , </S>",
    "<S> the cavity has to be isolated from all external disturbances . </S>",
    "<S> usually , the cavity is mounted very loosely in a vibration insensitive configuration @xcite to avoid excessive forces that would lead to deformations of the cavity and fluctuations of the optical path length and therefore its resonance frequency . </S>",
    "<S> however , this prevents the cavity from being easily transported , because the resonator will move and might be damaged during transportation .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we describe a prototype clock laser for a transportable neutral atom lattice clock . as a first realistic test for future transportable clock setups </S>",
    "<S> it was transported from braunschweig to dsseldorf .    </S>",
    "<S> the design of the laser system is constrained by requirements for its transportability in a car or truck and its spectral purity , for which typically a linewidth of 1  hz and a fractional stability of @xmath0 on timescales of a few seconds is needed .    </S>",
    "<S> the transportable clock laser setup consists of three separate parts : the laser breadboard ( 60  cm @xmath1 90  cm ) , a rolling table with the reference cavity inside a box for acoustic noise isolation ( outer dimensions including the table 150  cm @xmath1 88  cm @xmath1 195  cm ) and an electronics rack ( 60  cm @xmath1 60  cm @xmath1 180  cm ) . </S>",
    "<S> no effort was made to compactify the electronics . </S>",
    "<S> the laser breadboard includes a master - slave setup with a master laser in littman configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the laser is locked to the reference cavity with the pound - drever - hall technique using the laser current for fast frequency control @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> standard optical components were used to offer all the functionality that is needed for clock laser operation such as shifting the laser frequency with acousto - optic modulators ( aom ) . in particular the path length stabilization @xcite for two fibers was also set up using aoms on the breadboard . </S>",
    "<S> the light from the laser was sent to the cavity via a 2  m long fiber which was not actively stabilized . </S>",
    "<S> the volume of the system without the electronics rack was less than 3.0  m@xmath2 . for transportation </S>",
    "<S> the laser breadboard was packaged in a wooden box , the optical fibers and most of the electrical connections were removed . </S>",
    "<S> no special care was taken to isolate the laser system or the cavity against vibrations while transporting it .    </S>",
    "<S> the cavity is mounted in a passive , gold plated copper heat shield inside a vacuum chamber , evacuated by a small 2  l / s ion getter pump . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum system is installed on a passive vibration isolation platform , which was locked during the transport . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of an aluminum tube enclosing the vacuum system was stabilized to @xmath3c using a heating foil as control element . for simplicity and to avoid possible condensation no cooling was employed . </S>",
    "<S> this temperature does not agree to the zero expansion temperature of the all - ule ( ultra - low expansion glass ) cavity . from measurements done at similar spacers made of the same ule batch </S>",
    "<S> we expect this temperature to be at about @xmath4c . with a slope of the thermal expansion coefficient of @xmath5  </S>",
    "<S> k@xmath6 we expect at @xmath3c a sensitivity of the resonator frequency to temperature fluctuations of approximately @xmath7  khz / mk . during the transport </S>",
    "<S> , an uninterruptible power supply unit was used to keep the the vacuum pump and the temperature stabilization of the cavity running .    </S>",
    "<S> the cylindrical cavity spacer has a diameter of @xmath8  mm and is @xmath9  mm long . </S>",
    "<S> one plane and one concave ( 1  m radius of curvature ) ule mirror ( diameter 25.4  mm , thickness 6.3  mm ) were optically contacted to the spacer . </S>",
    "<S> the finesse of the cavity is 330  000 . to ensure transportability </S>",
    "<S> the mounting of the reference resonator was designed to be much more rigid than for other ultra - narrow linewidth lasers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> small viton cylinders are tightly pressed into four holed invar plates glued onto the cavity spacer ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cavity ] , details given in @xcite ) . the cylinders ( and thus the cavity ) </S>",
    "<S> are held in mounting rings that fix the resonator position in all three directions . </S>",
    "<S> side - way movement is inhibited because the viton pieces tightly fit into holes of the mounting rings and touch the inner side of the heat shield . </S>",
    "<S> the suspension positions of the mounting points were optimized by finite element ( fem ) calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the top of the cylinders is located at the horizontal symmetry plane and 17.5  mm from the end faces of the spacer . in previous measurements @xcite large frequency changes of the resonator mode </S>",
    "<S> were observed under accelerations . </S>",
    "<S> it was assumed that unintended mechanical contact of the spacer to the housing was the source of this effect . in a refined layout </S>",
    "<S> the mounting rings were connected by steel rods and great care was employed to prevent the cavity from touching the lids of the surrounding heat shield . </S>",
    "<S> also the length of the viton cylinders was increased to allow for a tight reliable fit of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> however only a marginally lower sensitivity to vertical vibrations of @xmath10/g was achieved . </S>",
    "<S> we now attribute this effect to squeezing forces introduced by the cavity mounting . </S>",
    "<S> these forces arise because the viton pieces are squeezed between the heat shield and the cavity spacer . for a force of 1n on each cylinder we calculated a change of the cavity length @xmath11 if the force acts in axial direction or @xmath12 if the force is radially squeezing the spacer . under acceleration </S>",
    "<S> a reaction force of 4  n / g has to be supplied by the viton cylinders . </S>",
    "<S> a 30% coupling of this force into axial direction could explain the observed sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> also deformations of the heat shield under acceleration can change the squeezing forces and contribute to the vibration sensitivity .    </S>",
    "<S> meticulous elimination of vibration incoupling on the vibration isolation platform led to acceptable laser performance . </S>",
    "<S> we also used the virtual beat with an ultra - stable laser at 657  nm @xcite to optimize our laser setup . </S>",
    "<S> a width of the beat signal of about 1  hz was achieved . calculating the allan deviation from the counted beat note we observed a flicker floor at about @xmath13 fractional stability .    </S>",
    "<S> the clock laser for the dsseldorf ytterbium lattice clock is based on a 1156  nm diode laser @xcite with an external littrow configuration cavity and containing a home - made intracavity electro - optic phase modulator for fast frequency corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the free - running linewidth is less than 100  khz . </S>",
    "<S> the output radiation ( approx . </S>",
    "<S> 20  mw ) is focused into a 20  mm ppln waveguide for frequency doubling . a maximum output of 0.5  mw at 578  nm was produced . </S>",
    "<S> this wave is stabilized to an all - ule cavity with a standard pound - drever - hall scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the finesse of the cavity exceeds 300  000 . </S>",
    "<S> it is of the cut - out type @xcite , with 100  mm length , 50  mm diameter , a 30  mm deep cut - out starting 4  mm below the mid - plane .    </S>",
    "<S> [ ht ]    the 578  nm reference cavity is housed in a massive gold - plated copper box and both are contained in a compact ( 11  cm @xmath1 11  cm @xmath1 18  cm ) aluminum vacuum chamber ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : ddcavity ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two entrance windows are glued to the vacuum chamber using torr seal epoxy . </S>",
    "<S> the chamber is machined out of a single aluminum block ; the cover is attached to the chamber using m4 screws and indium foil for sealing . </S>",
    "<S> a vacuum of about 5 @xmath14  mbar is maintained using a 2  l / s ion getter vacuum pump , attached to the cover plate . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum chamber and the vacuum pump are covered with a thermal and acoustic insulation box .    both the vacuum chamber and the copper housing are independently actively temperature stabilized by peltier elements and two ad590 temperature sensors . </S>",
    "<S> with this two - stage temperature stabilization system , which includes a temperature stabilized electronic controller , we reach a temperature instability of 0.15  mk at 100  s and 0.07  mk at 10  000  s integration time , as measured by the in - loop sensor on the copper box .    </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the cavity is kept close to the ule s thermal expansion coefficient zero crossing at approx . @xmath15c . </S>",
    "<S> the described construction demonstrated a remarkable performance as measured with the frequency comb in comparison to a gps disciplined hydrogen maser . </S>",
    "<S> no influence of the residual temperature instability on the resonator frequency could be detected within the stability of the maser ( approx @xmath16 ) . over a period of 35 days , the average drift of the cavity frequency was 56  mhz / s .    </S>",
    "<S> all the optics hardware fits on a @xmath17 cm @xmath1 @xmath18  cm breadboard that is supported by an active vibration isolation system , providing isolation along the three spatial directions . except for lock electronics , </S>",
    "<S> the system is enclosed by a wooden box for acoustic protection . </S>",
    "<S> this clock laser had previously been characterized by comparison with a second , independent ule cavity . </S>",
    "<S> a beat with an instability of less than @xmath19 for 1  s  10  s was obtained ( after subtraction of the differential cavity drift of approx . 0.1  hz / s ) .    </S>",
    "<S> [ ht ]    the 5 hour transport of the 698 nm laser system was performed using a small transport truck . </S>",
    "<S> the sr laser was locked to its ule cavity in dsseldorf within one day after start of loading in braunschweig . </S>",
    "<S> some realignment of the optical path had to be done after the transport because two mirror holders were not fixed well enough , but there was no indication that the cavity had moved inside its mounting . </S>",
    "<S> for the characterization of the sr clock laser the two lasers were operated in the frequency comb laboratory room in dsseldorf . </S>",
    "<S> both laser beams were sent via fibers to the frequency comb , the fiber noises were actively canceled .    </S>",
    "<S> the optical frequency synthesizer is a commercial ti : sa - based frequency comb ( menlo systems ) , modified in - house for higher long - term stability and expanded emission range . </S>",
    "<S> the 698  nm and 1156  nm laser beams ( frequencies @xmath20 ) are individually superposed with the comb via two beat lines . in this </S>",
    "<S> beat lines the laser beams are coupled out of their fibers and superposed with the corresponding modes from the comb . </S>",
    "<S> appropriate band - pass filters block the unnecessary comb modes before the overlap . </S>",
    "<S> the generated beat notes are detected by two photodetectors . </S>",
    "<S> the beat notes with frequencies @xmath21 , @xmath22 between each laser wave and the nearest comb mode were filtered and amplified with two tracking oscillators . the frequency comb s repetition rate and carrier envelope frequency @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> were locked to a gps disciplined hydrogen maser . counting @xmath22 and @xmath21 enabled absolute frequency measurement of the two clock lasers to be performed simultaneously .    the virtual beat technique @xcite consists in generating by electronic means an r.f . </S>",
    "<S> signal oscillating at the frequency @xmath24 that shows the properties of a beat note between two lasers at 1156  nm , since @xmath25 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the mode number of the nearest comb line to the 1156 nm ( 698  nm ) clock laser radiation . </S>",
    "<S> this beat note is sent to a spectrum analyzer , counted with a dead - time - free counter and , after mixing it down to a few hertz , sampled by an analog - digital converter . </S>",
    "<S> a record of the spectrum analyzer is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : beat ] together with a short sample of the digitalized beat ( inset ) .    the fractional allan deviation shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : allan ] was calculated using two different methods . for time values </S>",
    "<S> larger than 1s we used the counter signal , while the shorter values were derived from the signal of the analog - digital converter . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose we used a hilbert transform to add an imaginary part to the real signal to obtain an analytic signal @xcite . from this signal </S>",
    "<S> the phase and the instantaneous frequency were extracted . after removing linear and quadratic </S>",
    "<S> drifts the allan deviation for time intervals as short as @xmath28ms was calculated . for short times </S>",
    "<S> the trend is consistent with the linewidth observed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : beat ] . from 1  </S>",
    "<S> s to 10  s a noise floor of @xmath13 is reached . beyond 10  s </S>",
    "<S> , the residual differential cavity drift dominates the stability . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude from allan deviation and virtual beat spectrum that both lasers have a linewidth close to 1  hz . </S>",
    "<S> we have monitored the resonance frequency of the transportable cavity over more than 200 days including the time in dsseldorf . a shift of about 2  mhz measured after arrival in dsseldorf ( hatched area in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : drift ] ) was probably due to a change in the cavity temperature . during the transport </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the aluminum tube enclosing the vacuum system remained unchanged as monitored by the error signal of the temperature control . </S>",
    "<S> however at dsseldorf the laboratory temperature was above the set point of the temperature control that allowed heating only . </S>",
    "<S> this caused an increase in the temperature by about 0.4  k before the problem was discovered and the room temperature was lowered again . </S>",
    "<S> the very large drift rate of 5.3  hz / s observed during the first day of measurement could be explained by the cavity cooling down to its set temperature at a rate of @xmath29  mk / h . back in braunschweig , the original resonance frequency of the cavity was nearly recovered . </S>",
    "<S> we observed a reduced drift rate and a small remaining frequency offset , which we attribute to relaxation of stress in the cavity mounting during the transport . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the changed drift rate we did not observe any degradation of the system s performance . before and after the transport the laser was regularly used to record spectra of the @xmath30sr @xmath31s@xmath32  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2p@xmath32 transition with a fourier - limited linewidth of 9  hz and close to 90% excitation probability@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htb ]    in summary , we have demonstrated , for the first time , that a high - performance clock laser can be transported without difficulty and set up in a short time for enabling precision metrology applications . in the near future , the transportable clock laser could be combined with a transportable fiber - based frequency comb for even higher flexibility . </S>"
