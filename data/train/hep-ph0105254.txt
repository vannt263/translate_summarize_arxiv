    "the strong cp problem @xcite has been a puzzle since the 70 s when it was understood that the @xmath0 parameter of qcd is physical .",
    "more recently , the strong cp problem has sharpened because fits to @xmath1 and @xmath2 physics data now show that the unitarity triangle has three large angles @xcite .",
    "thus superweak models are ruled out , and cp violation in the ckm matrix is large , the phase is order one .",
    "the only other cp violating parameter in the standard model , the strong cp phase , is experimentally bound to be tiny @xcite , most recent measurements of the electric dipole moment of the neutron and @xmath3  hg imply @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry is especially puzzling since in the standard model the ckm phase @xmath5 and the strong cp phase @xmath6 have a common origin .",
    "both of them come from the yukawa couplings .",
    "the ckm matrix is the mismatch between the basis in which the up and down quark yukawa matrices are diagonal . in the absence of fine - tuning",
    ", a large ckm phase implies large phases in the yukawa matrices .",
    "but if phases in the yukawa matrices are large then the bound on the strong cp phase = -  y_u y_d [ eq : tbar ] implies fine - tuning of one part in @xmath7 ! here and in the following we assume real higgs vacuum expectation values so that phases in quark masses arise only from phases in yukawa couplings .",
    "the most popular proposed solutions to this problem are the axion @xcite , a vanishing up - quark mass @xcite and the nelson - barr mechanism @xcite . for others",
    "see e.g.  @xcite . for the axion solution @xmath6 is promoted to be a field , the axion .",
    "qcd dynamics generates a potential for the axion with a minimum at zero as desired .",
    "the trouble with this solution is that experimental searches for the axion have found nothing and together with cosmological constraints have reduced the allowed parameter space to a small window @xcite .",
    "a vanishing up - quark mass would nullify the strong cp problem because it would render @xmath6 unphysical .",
    "when @xmath8 then the strong cp phase can be removed from the lagrangian by redefining the phase of the up quark field .",
    "however , chiral perturbation theory disfavors @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "while this possibility is still under debate , the question will eventually be settled by lattice computations @xcite .",
    "finally , the nelson - barr mechanism stipulates that cp is a good symmetry at high scales .",
    "cp is broken spontaneously by a complex vev which is coupled to the quarks in such a way that it induces complex mixing with heavy vector - like fermions . by a clever choice of quark masses and yukawa couplings",
    ", one can arrange for a large ckm phase and @xmath9 .",
    "loop corrections to @xmath6 are dangerous in the nelson - barr scheme , however they can be made sufficiently small by taking the coupling to the cp violating vev small .    in this letter",
    "we propose a new solution to the strong cp problem which relies on spontaneous cp violation and uses the non - renormalization theorems of supersymmetry to ensure that @xmath6 remains zero .",
    "our basic framework assumes unbroken cp and susy at a high scale , e.g.  the planck scale .",
    "therefore we can choose a basis in which all coupling constants are real and @xmath10 .",
    "cp breaks spontaneously at the scale @xmath11 , and we assume that the mssm fields do not couple to complex vevs at tree level .",
    "thus @xmath12 at tree level .",
    "however , a sufficiently large ckm phase is generated by loops if the cp violating sector ( cpx ) is strongly coupled to quarks .",
    "naively one would expect that a strong cp phase of order one is also generated .",
    "happily , @xmath6 is protected by a non - renormalization theorem @xcite .",
    "thus in susy quantum loops can generate a large ckm phase while @xmath6 remains exactly zero .",
    "after susy breaking the non - renormalization theorem no longer holds , and a small @xmath6 is generated .",
    "we show that @xmath6 remains sufficiently small if susy breaking occurs at low energies and is cp and flavor preserving .",
    "measurements of the superpartner spectrum , electric dipole moments and cp and flavor physics in the @xmath2-system will test the predictions of our framework .    in the following section we discuss the general framework in more detail .",
    "we give a specific model of cp violation which exemplifies our mechanism in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss susy breaking and in the fifth section we list model independent predictions .",
    "we conclude in section 6 .",
    "we now discuss our general scenario in more detail . below the cut - off scale ( for example the planck scale or the string scale )",
    "we assume that susy and cp are good symmetries so that we can describe physics at this scale by a local supersymmetric lagrangian with real couplings and vanishing @xmath0-parameters .",
    "cp must be broken spontaneously at a lower scale @xmath11 by the complex vev of one or several scalar fields @xmath13 . in order to prevent a direct large contribution to @xmath6 at this scale",
    "we assume that there are no tree level superpotential couplings of @xmath13 to the mssm or other colored fields .",
    "this could be enforced by a symmetry , or such couplings may be suppressed for geometric reasons in extra dimensions @xcite . in order to communicate cp violation to the mssm",
    "we assume that the cpx sector couples to the quarks through messenger fields which couple to @xmath13 .",
    "there may also be arbitrary kaehler potential couplings of @xmath13 to the mssm .",
    "such couplings are harmless , because the kaehler potential is real and can not contribute to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this lagrangian is renormalized at the loop level . in the following , it is convenient to use the `` holomorphic '' renormalization scheme in which non - renormalization theorems are manifest",
    ". then both the superpotential and @xmath6 are not renormalized .",
    "however the kaehler potential is renormalized , and if the cp messenger sector and it s couplings violate flavor non - canonical complex kinetic terms for the quarks are induced .",
    "the most general cp violating kinetic terms are @xmath14 hermitian matrices @xmath15 for each set of fields with identical gauge quantum numbers . because the @xmath15 s are hermitian and positive definite we can write @xmath16 with a hermitian @xmath17 and change to the canonical basis l ~d^4  z^ij q^_i q_j = d^4  ^ij q_i^q_jq = t^-1q  .",
    "[ eq : wavefunc ] note that wave - function renormalization by the hermitian matrix leaves @xmath0 invariant  , because @xmath0 shifts proportional to @xmath18 . in the new basis",
    "the yukawa terms are @xmath19 , @xmath20 , where y_d = t_q^t y_d t_dy_u = t_q^t y_u t_u  , [ eq : yuks ] and also  =  - y_d y_u   =  0 - y_d y_u  =  0  , reflecting the non - renormalization of @xmath6 .",
    "however , even though @xmath6 remains zero , the new yukawa matrices are clearly complex and a complex ckm matrix is generated .",
    "it is intuitive ( but somewhat tedious to show @xcite ) that a large ckm phase is generated if the wave - function renormalization factors @xmath17 are not close to the unit matrix .",
    "thus if the cp violating dynamics breaks cp by order one and is strongly coupled to the quarks then we obtain _ ckm ~o(1 )  , = 0[eq : tbar=0 ] as desired .",
    "it is also easy to show that all values for quark masses , mixing angles and ckm phase can be generated in this way . to see this ,",
    "pick as an example @xmath21 . before discussing susy breaking and corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tbar=0 ] ) in section [ sec : susyx ] we give an explicit example for the cp violating sector .",
    "in this section , we give one of many possible models as an example .",
    "this model generates large wave function renormalizations only for the down quark singlet which is sufficient to obtain a large ckm phase .",
    "other models with @xmath22 or @xmath23 unification and messenger fields in full representations of the gut group can also be built and may be more attractive / predictive .",
    "in addition to the usual mssm superpotential and canonical kinetic terms we assume the following superpotential at the high scale , @xmath24 w = r_ij d_i f_j t + m_cp t t + _ ij f_i f_j  .",
    "here @xmath17 and @xmath25 are a vector - like , fourth - generation down quark singlet with real mass @xmath11 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are three vector - like sm singlets which obtain complex masses from their coupling to the complex vev @xmath28 and we have absorbed a coupling constant into the definition of @xmath13 .    0.0truein    = 1.8 in    0.0truein    integrating out the massive fields at the scale @xmath11 sets the above superpotential to zero , the mssm superpotential remains unchanged in the `` holomorphic '' renormalization scheme , and the one - loop diagram of figure 1 renormalizes the wave function of the right handed down quarks [ eq : downrenorm ] z_d  ~  r^^r 16 ^2 m_cp^2  log  .",
    "note that the coupling constant @xmath29 needs to be strong ( @xmath30 ) in order for @xmath31 and @xmath32 not to be close to the unit matrix .",
    "the strong coupling renders this one - loop calculation of @xmath15 unreliable , and we simply parameterize the full result by @xmath32 .",
    "requires new strong gauge interactions for the @xmath17 s and @xmath26 s .",
    "we have checked that quantum corrections involving these new gauge interactions do not spoil our mechanism , neither perturbatively nor non - perturbatively @xcite . ]",
    "it is important that there are no true vertex renormalizations of @xmath33 due to the non - renormalization theorem .",
    "this should highlight why susy is crucial for our approach . in a non - supersymmetric theory one - particle - irreducible vertex corrections",
    "do arise at some order , and because of the strong coupling diagrams with arbitrarily many loops are dangerous .    at the renormalizable level ,",
    "the wave - function renormalization factor @xmath32 is the only parameter which remains from the cp violating dynamics at scales below @xmath11 .",
    "higher dimensional operators suppressed by @xmath11 are also generated . in the presence of susy breaking they lead to important corrections to @xmath6 as we discuss in section [ sec : susyx ] .",
    "finally , we note that we can relax the condition that @xmath13 not couple at all to mssm fields in the superpotential to a less stringent constraint by allowing couplings at the non - renormalizable level .",
    "operators such as  ( m_pl)^n  w_w^result in contributions to @xmath34 which implies @xmath35 .",
    "the existence of such operators is model dependent , and the upper bound on @xmath11 is therefore not mandatory .",
    "since susy is broken in nature we need to check that our mechanism for protecting @xmath6 from radiative corrections remains stable after susy breaking . in this letter",
    "we only discuss this topic very briefly , a more detailed discussion is in our longer paper @xcite , and many of the results of this section can also be found in @xcite .",
    "the non - renormalization theorems are violated in the presence of susy breaking , and @xmath6 is renormalized .",
    "one contribution to @xmath6 that is always there is the well - known heavily gim suppressed and therefore finite sm contribution which arises at four - loops @xcite from the `` cheburashka '' diagram @xcite and gives @xmath36 .",
    "the diagram is dominated by loop momenta near the qcd scale and is therefore independent of the mechanism of susy breaking .    0.0truein    = 1.5 in    0.0truein    however , there are also new contributions which are specific to softly broken susy theories . in the mssm",
    "the expression for @xmath6 must be generalized to include the phase of the gluino mass @xmath37 = - y_u y_d - 3 m_g  .",
    "[ eq : susytbar ] thus the gluino mass must be real to one part in @xmath7 .",
    "the same bound applies to the b - term , because a complex b leads to complex higgs vevs .",
    "the phases of the remaining flavor - universal mssm parameters are also tightly constrained @xmath38 , because they induce contributions to @xmath6 from the one - loop diagrams in figure 2 .",
    "but even if all phases in soft terms vanish the diagrams of figure 2 can still generate large contributions to @xmath6 because they involve the complex mssm yukawa couplings .",
    "the diagrams give expressions such as @xmath39 and renormalize @xmath6 unless @xmath40 is either zero or else proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "the most natural way to suppress these contributions is to assume that susy breaking is universal and proportional [ eq : universality ] m_^2",
    "~m_^2 ~m_^2 1  , a_u / d y_u / d  . then @xmath42 , and all other similar traces vanish to 12th order in an expansion of yukawa couplings @xcite , and therefore contributions from susy breaking to @xmath6 are negligibly small .",
    "very near universality and proportionality as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : universality ] ) are required at the weak scale .",
    "a susy breaking and communication mechanism which accomplishes this is gauge mediation .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in @xcite , where we find that our mechanism works very naturally with gauge mediation @xcite .",
    "other susy breaking scenarios which are compatible are anomaly mediation @xcite and gaugino mediation @xcite .",
    "the scenario can not , however , be combined with minimal supergravity .",
    "the reason being that even if in msugra soft masses are assumed to be universal at the planck scale they are strongly renormalized by the strong cp and flavor violating dynamics at @xmath11 and become completely non - degenerate .",
    "inserting these non - degenerate soft masses into the diagrams of figure 2 gives disastrously large contributions to @xmath6 .",
    "this argument implies quite generally ( anomaly mediation is an important exception ) that susy breaking needs to be communicated to the mssm at a scale well below @xmath11 .    as the messenger scales of gauge mediation and cp violation",
    "get near each other corrections to @xmath6 proportional to @xmath43 arise and give the bound @xmath44 @xcite from requiring @xmath4 .",
    "note that if this bound is saturated then neutron dipole moment measurements should find non - vanishing results soon . using the lowest possible messenger scale in gauge mediation @xmath45 gev we find @xmath46 gev .",
    "therefore the particles of the cp violating sector can not be produced at existing or planned accelerators .",
    "however there are several indirect predictions from our scenario which allow it to be tested .",
    "we discuss them in the next section .",
    "even though the cpx dynamics of our solution to the strong cp problem necessarily hides at short distances there are several testable consequences .",
    "we predict @xcite :    1 .",
    "supersymmetry 2 .   minimal flavor violation , i.e. , no new flavor violation beyond the yukawa couplings with the well - known implications for @xmath2-physics @xcite .",
    "3 .   no new cp violation beyond the sm , in particular no new cp violation in the @xmath2-system . for example",
    "@xmath47 is large as in the sm @xcite .",
    "4 .   almost degenerate first and second generation scalars of each gauge quantum number .",
    "the splittings are proportional to the square of the corresponding yukawa couplings and give @xmath48 gev which should be measurable at a linear collider .",
    "we stress that this degeneracy has to hold independent of the susy breaking mechanism .",
    "@xmath6 is predicted to lie between the current experimental bound of @xmath49 and @xmath50 depending on the ratios of scales @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "if we are lucky the corresponding hadron electric dipole moments will be measured soon @xcite .",
    "lepton dipole moments are expected to be much smaller .",
    "the strong cp problem has recently become more urgent because experimental data strongly favor a ckm phase of order one , 10 orders of magnitude larger than the upper bound on the strong cp phase .",
    "this represents a puzzle because both appear to arise from yukawa couplings in the sm . in this letter",
    "we propose a new solution where cp is broken spontaneously and mediated to the sm by radiative corrections . obtaining a large ckm phase",
    "requires the radiative corrections to be large , forcing us to consider strongly coupled models .",
    "whereas such models are very difficult if not impossible to build without susy we have argued that the non - renormalization theorems of susy make such a solution to the strong cp problem very natural .",
    "the ckm phase gets @xmath53 contributions from renormalization whereas the strong cp phase remains exactly zero in the supersymmetric limit .",
    "our picture requires flavor - universal susy breaking and mediation and is compatible with gauge- , anomaly- , and gaugino - mediation but not compatible with minimal supergravity .",
    "we presented an explicit model for the cp messenger sector , but we stress that the framework is much more general because it is based on model - independent non - renormalization theorems .",
    "it would be interesting to build complete gut models based on our framework , possibly with flavor and cp violation originating from the same strongly coupled dynamics .",
    "a promising avenue to pursue is to combine our framework with the models of nelson and strassler @xcite .",
