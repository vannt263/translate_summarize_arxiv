    "sodium emission has been previously observed in both long - period and dynamically new comets ( rahe et al .",
    "1976 , sivaraman et al . 1979 , hicks and fink 1997 ) .",
    "although the abundance of sodium in comets is much lower than other observable elements and molecules , it can be used as a tracer of processes acting in the same environment .",
    "this is because the extremely high efficiency of the sodium atom in resonant scattering of solar radiation makes it detectable even when the column density is low .",
    "for instance the absolute sodium abundance in the io atmosphere is @xmath11% , yet it has been the neutral species most studied after its discovery and is an important tracer of the atmospheric interactions with the plasma torus ( thomas 1992 ) .",
    "further examples are that of the tenuous atmospheres of mercury and the moon .",
    "if the sources of the sodium observed in comet hale - bopp and in other comets can be identified , it could be possible to study the sodium distribution and dynamics as a tracer of physical processes that may otherwise not be easily detectable .",
    "+ in the context of the present observations , the first possible identification of a sodium tail was recorded by newall ( 1910 ) during the spectroscopic observation of comet c/1910 a1 , made with a direct - vision prism inserted between the eye and the eyepiece of the 25-inch telescope . later",
    "a 7 degree - long sodium tail was reported in comet c/1957 p1 mrkos by nguyen - huu - doan ( 1960 ) using a schmidt camera with an objective prism . in both cases",
    "the sodium tail was identified through spectroscopic observation of the d - line emission , however there was no detailed analysis of the morphology of the tail and the mechanism responsible for these features .",
    "more recently , sodium was observed in comets c/1965f ikeya - seki ( spinrad and miner , 1968 , huebner , 1970 ) , c/1969 y1 bennett ( rahe et al .",
    "1976 ) and c/1976 v1 west ( sivaraman et al .",
    "1979 ) within 100000 km of the nucleus .",
    "the giotto spacecraft performed _ in  situ _ measurements in the coma of comet halley and found the ratio na / o @xmath2 , close to the cosmic ratio ( jessberger and kissel , 1991 ) . in this letter",
    "we report on the discovery and analysis of an extensive neutral sodium tail observed in comet c/1995 o1 hale - bopp , first reported by cremonese ( 1997 ) .",
    "images of comet hale  bopp were obtained in the period 1622 of april with the cocam wide  field imaging instrument on la palma plus a narrow  band sodium filter ( @xmath3 , fwhm@xmath4 ) designed to isolate emission from the sodium d@xmath5 and d@xmath6 lines .",
    "cocam consists of a 35 mm camera zoom lens working at f/3.5 and imaging onto a @xmath7 pixel eev ccd chip , whose pixel size of 22.5@xmath8 m square corresponds to 26 arcsec , thereby achieving on the sky a total field of @xmath9 degrees .",
    "imaging was also obtained with filters designed to isolate both h@xmath5o@xmath10 emission in the ion tail ( @xmath11 , fwhm@xmath12 ) and the solar continuum due to dust scattering ( @xmath13 , fwhm@xmath14 ) .",
    "the wide field sodium images immediately revealed the presence of a very linear structure stretching several degrees close to the anti ",
    "sunward direction , with no obvious counterpart in the h@xmath5o@xmath10 and dust images , and which we took to be a separate neutral na tail ( cremonese et al .",
    "1997 , fitzsimmons et al .",
    "an example image is shown in figure 1 .",
    "resolution spectroscopy was performed at several points along this tail on april 19.9 ut , 20.9 ut and 23.9 ut , using the 4.2 m william hershel telescope with the utrecht echelle spectrograph and @xmath15 pixel tek ccd chip , providing a dispersion of 0.053  pixel@xmath16 and a resolution of @xmath17  with a slit width of @xmath18 arcsec . on the last date",
    "the narrow  band sodium filter described above was placed in the spectrograph , thereby allowing long  slit spectroscopy to be performed .",
    "this configuration allowed us to have a larger spatial coverage of @xmath19 arcmin while simultaneously isolating the single order with only the nad emission lines . in all spectra",
    "redshifted na emission was observed , thereby confirming the presence of neutral sodium in this tail .",
    "unfortunately it was not possible to obtain both images of the sodium tail and high resolution spectra in the long slit configuration during the same night , due to only one sodium interference filter being available .",
    "the comet during these nights had a heliocentric distance of 0.98 au and a geocentric distance of 1.61 au .",
    "+ all the spectra were cosmic - ray cleaned and bias - subtracted using figaro spectroscopic reduction routines ( shortridge et al .",
    "1997 ) . for the normal echelle - mode data obtained on the 19th and 20th april",
    ", each order was individually flatfielded using tungsten lamp exposures at the same instrumental settings .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed via exposures of a thorium - argon lamp obtained at the beginning and end of the period of visibility of the comet . from these arc - lamp exposures ,",
    "the instrumental resolution in the order containing the nad lines was @xmath20  fwhm . due to the short length of the slit in this observing mode necessary to avoid order overlap ( @xmath21 arcsec ) ,",
    "no flux calibration was attempted .",
    "+ because of severe instrumental problems , comparison lamp exposures were not possible on the 23rd april . therefore after bias subtraction and cosmic - ray removal , wavelength calibration was performed using the strong nad airglow lines observed simultaneously with the cometary emission .",
    "exposures of the lunar surface had the reflected solar spectrum removed , thereby leaving simply the transmission profile of the order isolating filter .",
    "this was then used to correct the data for the filter transmission profile at all points along the slit . flux calibration for these data was obtained via exposures of the standard star bd @xmath22 ( oke 1990 ) with a @xmath23 arcsec wide slit .",
    "a representative spectrum is shown in figure 2 .",
    "from these spectra , the brightness and velocity as a function of distance along the tail has been modelled assuming that the gas was produced by the nucleus and/or a near  nucleus source with dimensions much smaller than the tail length .",
    "it then undergoes acceleration in the antisun direction due to simple radiation pressure , through photon scattering ( fluorescence ) in the resonant d - line transitions . in this case the column density of na atoms at a sky  projected cometocentric distance @xmath24 along the tail is equal to    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the production rate , @xmath27 is the lifetime of the sodium atoms at a heliocentric distance of 1 au , r@xmath28 is the heliocentric distance along the tail , @xmath29 is the sky  projected linear dimension of the tail cross ",
    "section , @xmath30 is the sky  projected na velocity along the tail , and @xmath31 is the mean travel time of the na atoms from the nucleus to the tail distance @xmath24 . in the approximation of a purely antisunward sodium velocity , then the sky  projected sodium velocity @xmath30 ,",
    "the heliocentric sodium velocity @xmath32 and the radial sodium velocity measured in the echelle spectra @xmath33 are related by @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the phase angle and @xmath37 is the comet geocentric velocity . if @xmath38 is the starting velocity of the na atoms from the source , then the width of the tail will be @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the linear dimension of the source region .",
    "moreover , the transverse acceleration of the na atoms due to the random - walk nature of the scattering process should be taken into account .",
    "we find that na atoms starting with an outflow velocity of @xmath41 km s@xmath16 provides a width @xmath29 close to that observed , and that the term @xmath42 dominates the others for @xmath43 km .",
    "then , the average emitted intensity ( in rayleighs ) of the tail axis is given by    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the photon scattering efficiency , or g  factor , in the d@xmath6 and d@xmath5 lines at 1 au . as this region of the solar spectrum also displays several additional absorption lines , the g  factor is highly dependent on the heliocentric velocity and consequently on @xmath30 and @xmath24 .",
    "therefore the acceleration due to solar radiation pressure , assuming that emission out the d@xmath6 and d@xmath5 lines is negligible , is also dependent on the velocity and heliocentric distance , and allows us to compute the ratio between the radiation pressure force and the solar gravitational force ;    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the gravitational constant , @xmath48 is planck s constant , @xmath49 is the sun s mass and @xmath50 is the mass of the na atom . + figure 3 shows the g(l ) factor , the @xmath51 factor , the modelled and observed tailward velocities and surface brightness along the tail .",
    "surface brightnesses were measured from the spectra rather than the cocam data due to large uncertainties resulting from attempts to accurately calibrate these extremely wide - field images .",
    "the lifetime for photoionization of the sodium atom is rather controversial . using measurements of the na cross section by hudson and carter ( 1967 ) , huebner et al .",
    "( 1992 ) evaluated an experimental lifetime of @xmath52 s at a heliocentric distance of 1 au .",
    "however , following a theoretical recalculation of the cross section by chang and kelly ( 1975 ) , huebner et al . also suggested a value almost three times longer of @xmath53 s. in previous studies of the moon , mercury , io and other comets , values close to the shorter `` experimental '' na lifetime quoted above have been used .",
    "however , killen et al . (",
    "1997 ) have claimed to require a longer lifetime to explain the different accommodation time of the sodium atoms on the surface of mercury and some characteristics of its atmosphere .",
    "therefore we attempted to fit the observed brightness distribution assuming both of the above photoionization timescales .",
    "as shown in figure 3 , the observed brightness of the tail is consistent with our model if we adopt the longer photoionization timescale of @xmath54 at 1 au .",
    "+ modelling has also been applied to the cocam images , again assuming that radiation pressure due to resonance fluorescence in the d ",
    "lines is solely responsible for the existence of the tail .",
    "if the particles with the same @xmath55 are ejected with velocity @xmath38 from the inner coma , then the resulting na tail will be a syndynamic tube of width @xmath42 .",
    "the axis of this syndynamic tube is the _ syndyne _ defined by @xmath51 , which is computed by means of keplerian mechanics ( finson and probstein 1968 , fulle 1992 ) . applying the syndynamic model to cocam images taken on april 21.9 ut and trying to fit the data with different values of @xmath55",
    ", table 1 lists the position angles ( pa ) of the na tail : @xmath56 is measured from the cocam images , and @xmath57 is the computed pa of the range of best fitting syndynes of @xmath58 .",
    "this high value of @xmath55 implies that only atoms can satisfy the fit and not molecules or dust grains , for which the largest value reported in literature is @xmath59 .",
    "+ we applied the same syndynamic model to the d  line emission velocities measured within the sodium tail . in table 2 , those observed ( @xmath60 ) on april 23.9 ut are compared with those predicted from the model ( @xmath61 ) , assuming the best fitting @xmath62 . this value is consistent with , but much more accurate than , that provided by the tail pa fit .",
    "we stress that such a high @xmath55 value would be impossible for dust particles , but is entirely reasonable for atoms . using this value in equation ( 3 )",
    "we deduce @xmath63 s@xmath16 amu@xmath16 .",
    "since for sodium at 1 au @xmath64 s@xmath16 , we calculate the mass of any possible sodium - bearing molecule in the tail as @xmath65 amu .",
    "this conclusively demonstrates that the observed tail is composed of neutral na atoms alone , as na  bearing molecules would then be too massive to be consistent with such a high @xmath55 ratio .",
    "the excellent fit between theory and observations , provided by both models , allows us to conclude with large confidence that the observed na tail is due to fluorescence of na atoms which have been released from the nucleus and/or a near  nucleus source and not _ in  situ _ in the sodium tail .",
    "+ the data presented here do not reveal the exact nature of the source of the sodium atoms observed in the tail . from the absolute flux calibration of the spectra on april 23.9 ut , we obtain a production rate of @xmath66 atoms s@xmath16 .",
    "the water sublimation rate at this time was of order @xmath67 molecules s@xmath16 ( dello russo et al . 1997 ) .",
    "assuming that hale - bopp possessed normal cosmic abundances with na / o = @xmath68 ( anders and grevesse 1989 ) , then @xmath69% of the sodium in the comet was being released into the tail at this time .",
    "furthermore the percentage of visible sodium could be altered by a factor 2 or more if we take into account the very large dust - to - gas ratios mentionned for hale - bopp and the likely significant o content in the refractory dust . in any case",
    "this implies that whatever the source , the majority of na remained unobservable in this comet .",
    "we have reported both imaging and high - resolution spectroscopy of the sodium tail associated with comet c/1995 o1 hale - bopp .",
    "two different approaches have been used to analyze the new sodium tail which allow the identification of the mechanism responsible ; the simple but effective process of fluorescence . based on this mechanism ,",
    "we expect the appearance of a sodium tail to vary strongly with observing geometry ( phase angle ) and heliocentric velocity of the comet as the na emissions move with respect to the solar fraunhofer absorption lines ( the swings effect ) , thereby changing their intensity and acceleration .",
    "this is therefore a possible explanation for the different na distributions observed in hale - bopp at other dates ( wilson et al .",
    "1997 ) and in previous comet observations .",
    "+ the associated modelling supports the theoretical value for the photoionization lifetime of the sodium atom of @xmath54 at 1 au , a factor 3 higher than that generally used to study the exospheres of other solar system bodies , _",
    "e.g. _ the moon and io .",
    "the tail sodium atoms appear to have been released in the near - nucleus region of the comet , and not _ in - situ _ via the break - up of na  bearing molecules , ions or dust particles . assuming normal cosmic abundances for the comet",
    ", @xmath69% of the expected amount of sodium released by the comet is directly observable in the na tail .",
    "both future analysis of existing data and observations of other comets should concentrate on investigating the exact source distribution in the inner coma .",
