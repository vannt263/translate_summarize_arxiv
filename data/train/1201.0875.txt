    "the standard model and most of its supersymmetric extensions suffer from being a  theory of massless particles .",
    "therefore a  mechanism that would provide masses is required . among several possibilities the higgs mechanism plays a  major role .",
    "it assumes the existence of an additional scalar field , the higgs field , which has non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "the correct implementation of this mechanism leads in the standard model not only to massive gauge bosons ( with the photon correctly remaining massless ) , but also to massive fermions , and a proper electroweak symmetry breaking from the weak gauge groups @xmath2 to the electromagnetism @xmath3 .",
    "these features make this mechanism an extremely convenient and elegant solution",
    ". the experimental smoking gun confirming this theory would be the discovery of the higgs boson .",
    "earlier this year the tevatron collaborations cdf and d0 reported an excess of events in the higgs to two photons channel ( @xmath4 ) observed in the mass region 120140 gev @xcite .",
    "the significance of these data were reported on the level of @xmath5 . only recently the newly announced lhc7 results @xcite from the atlas and cms collaborations confirmed an excess of events in the same channel within 115130 gev range , with a  maximum at 125 gev , at the statistical significance of @xmath6 .",
    "even though @xmath5 can not be named a  discovery , an effect independently obtained within very similar mass ranges by four project working on two biggest accelerators in the world may give hope that some new particle has been observed .",
    "even though the experimental results are at first interpreted within the standard model , its supersymmetric and other exotic extensions of various kinds can also be tested against the newly reported findings @xcite . following this line of research , in this communication we discuss an @xmath1-parity violating minimal supergravity ( rpv msugra ) model and constrain it by the liberal condition for the lightest higgs boson mass @xmath7 . also",
    "the specific case of @xmath8 is considered .",
    "the @xmath1-parity is a  multiplicative quantum number defined as @xmath9 and implies stability of the lightest supersymmetric particle . in this paper , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we adopt the so - called generalized baryon parity in the form of a  discrete @xmath10 symmetry @xmath11 which ensures the stability of the proton and lack of unwanted dimension-5 operators . in short",
    ", @xmath1 is equal to + 1 for ordinary particles , and @xmath12 for supersymmetric partners , and this @xmath1 is usually assumed to be conserved in interactions .",
    "this assumption , however , is based mainly on our will to exclude lepton and baryon number violating processes , which has not been observed in the low - energy regime .",
    "notice , that the generation lepton numbers @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , also conserved in the standard model , are broken in the neutrino oscillations .",
    "there is in fact no underlying principle which forbids breaking of @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "the baryon number violation is highly constrained by the proton decay , but the lepton number violation may occur at high energies . in general supersymmetric models",
    "one often discusses the possibility of having the @xmath1-parity violating terms , properly suppressed , in the theory .",
    "these are the so - called @xmath1parity violating models .",
    "we perform the calculations within the framework described in detail in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this model takes into account full dependence of the mass matrices and renormalization group equations on the @xmath1parity violating couplings .",
    "we define it below by quoting the expressions for the superpotential and soft supersymmetry breaking lagrangian .",
    "next , we discuss the free parameters of the model , and the higgs sector .",

    "the supersymmetry is not observed in the regime of energies accessible to our experiments , therefore it must be broken at some point . a  convenient method to take this fact into account",
    "is to introduce explicit terms , which break supersymmetry in a  soft way , ie .",

    "one of the weaknesses of the supersymmetric models is their enormous number of free parameters , which easily may exceed 100 .",
    "this lowers significantly their predictive power .",
    "therefore it is a custom approach to impose certain boundary conditions , which allow in turn to _ derive _ other unknown parameters .",
    "one may either start with certain known values at low energies and evaluate the values of other parameters at higher energies , or assume , along the grand unified theories ( gut ) line of thinking , common values at the unification scale and evaluate them down . in both cases the renormalization group equations ( rge )",
    "we follow the top - down approach by assuming the following :    * we introduce a common mass @xmath40 for all the scalars at the gut scale @xmath41 , * we introduce a similar common mass @xmath42 for all the fermions at the gut scale , * we set all the trilinear soft supersymmetry breaking couplings @xmath37 to be proportional to the respective yukawa couplings with a common factor @xmath43 , @xmath44 at @xmath45 .",
    "the only couplings which we allow to evolve freely , are the rpv @xmath46 s , which are set to a  common value @xmath47 at @xmath48 and are being modified by the rge running only .",
    "the reason for this is , that we want to keep them non - zero , but on the other hand their influence at the low scale must be small . in the first part of this presentation we will fix @xmath49 , which assures only small admixture of the rpv interactions .",

    "there are two remaining free parameters in the model , one describing the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets @xmath51 , the other being the sign of the higgs self - coupling constant , @xmath52 , which gives altogether only six free parameters . in this calculations",
    "we have kept @xmath21 positive , and fixed @xmath47 , so the resultant parameter space to analyze is four dimensional .",
    "it is also a common practice to restrict the calculations to the third family of quarks and leptons only , which is supposed to give the dominant contributions . since",
    "this issue is difficult to keep under control , we keep dependence on all three families . also , unlike the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , we keep the full dependence on all the rpv couplings .",
    "the procedure of finding the minimum for the scalar potential is quite involving .",
    "the equations one has to solve in this model are given in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , the numerical procedure used by us differs slightly from the one presented in the cited paper .",
    "the goal is to find the values of @xmath21 , @xmath53 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , as well as the five vacuum expectation values @xmath54 of the two higgs bosons and three sneutrinos .",
    "the initial values for the vev s are @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",
    "we start by setting @xmath59 and evaluating @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 to the @xmath45 scale .",

    "also , quite often if one of the @xmath112 s takes smaller value , it is compensated by a high value of the other .",
    "it is worth to comment at this point at the recent constraint on supersymmetry formulated by the lhc collaborations cms and atlas @xcite .",
    "it excludes the existence of supersymmetric particles with masses below roughly 1 tev .",
    "however , this conclusion has been drawn for the simplest supersymmetric models in which , among others , the @xmath1-parity is conserved , and as such do not directly apply to the model discussed here .",
    "all the calculations have been presented so far for a  fixed @xmath92 parameter .",

    "on the other hand , values of @xmath47 of the order of @xmath113 have a  very big impact on the results , often throwing the mass spectrum out of the allowed ranges .",
    "there is therefore a  rather modest region of the @xmath47 parameters in which the model is still physically acceptable , and at the same time the rpv contributions are not marginal .",
    "let us now check what is the @xmath47 dependence of the @xmath0 mass for the 19 candidate points listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : higgs2 ] .",
    "we do not expect all of them to behave in the same way under the change of the @xmath47 parameter , especially that some of them are found in the @xmath101 region , which is in parts numerically unstable .",

    "these points would be the sought solutions in the @xmath1parity conserving model , and also in the rpv case presented here for fine - tuned values of @xmath47 .",
    "we see that deviations from the @xmath114 may be substantial for @xmath47 greater than @xmath115 , with general tendency to increase ( lower right hand side pannel ) or decrease / oscillate ( upper left hand side pannel ) .",
    "the last , upper right hand side pannel shows three points which very weakly depend on the changing of @xmath47 .",
    "the solutions obtained form them are stable , regardles in the rpc and rpv regime",
    ". these points , surprisingly , also have @xmath101 .",
    "it was interesting to check , that for the typical minimal supergravity model with broken @xmath1-parity there is a  quite wide parameter space , for which the mass of the lightest higgs boson is compatible with the recent tevatron observations .",
    "however , if one refines the constraints using the lhc7 results , the parameter space shrinks drastically to a  set of points roughly given in tab .",
    "[ tab : higgs2 ] . in this communication",

    "1-loop neutrino masses will be given elsewhere .",
    "we may conclude that , in the way presented above , we have found 17 good candidate points in the rpv msugra model which result in a  physically acceptable mass spectrum and are at the same time compatible with the newest higgs boson searches .",
