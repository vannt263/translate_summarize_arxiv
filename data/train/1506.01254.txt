    "in his opening speach to iau colloquium 107 ( ` algols ' ) , batten ( 1989 ) was tempted to define an algol system simply as `` a binary in which the less massive component fills its roche lobe and the other , which does not , is not degenerate '' .",
    "the resulting evolutionary paradox can be solved by postulating an episode of mass transfer from what was initially the more massive component to its then less massive , and consequently less evolved , companion ( crawford 1955 ) .",
    "this first , rapid , phase of mass exchange between the components eventually leads to an algol - type system .",
    "numerical calculations of the evolution of stars in binary systems have proved this hypothesis to be very plausible ( cf .",
    "paczyski 1971 )",
    ".    direct comparison of the observed properties of algol systems to evolutionary model calculations are sparse , because only a few algols have reliable measurements of their physical properties ( maxted & hilditch 1996 ) , and because models are unavailable for the relevant parameters .",
    "the main observational obstacle in the determination of the accurate stellar quantities for algols arises due to the intrinsic faintness of the roche - lobe filling mass - losing component , the reason they were detected only due to technological advances in light detectors ( c.f .",
    "tomkin 1989 ) .",
    "model calculations for algol with both conservative and non - conservative binary evolution have only been calculated by sarna ( 1993 ) .",
    "changes in the chemical composition of the surface layers of stars which have experienced mass transfer are a feature of theoretical predictions .",
    "layers that were once deep inside the star become exposed after mass transfer .",
    "this makes it possible to observationally probe cno nucleosynthetic processes in stellar cores , and the efficiency of different mixing processes in stellar interiors . in that sense",
    "cno abundances can serve as a sensitive probe of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "carbon depletions have been detected in algol and in algol - type systems ( parthasarathy , lambert & tomkin 1979 , 1983 ; cugier & hardorp 1988 ; cugier 1989 ; tomkin et al .",
    "1993 , ibanolu et al .",
    "however , comparisons to theoretical models were rather scarce since detailed evolutionary calculations were performed for only a few algol - type systems , and were limited to tracing the evolution of carbon ( de greve & cugier 1989 ; sarna 1992 , 1993 ; de greve 1993 ) . on the observational side , algol systems can be rather difficult .",
    "the secondary stars are roche - lobe filling subgiants which are usually intrinsically faint , but still bright enough to contaminate the spectra of the primary stars .",
    "many contain third components , as is the case for algol itself , which further complicates spectroscopic analyses .",
    "therefore , we initiated a new observational project to obtain high - resolution chelle spectroscopy of algol systems to which we could apply the powerful technique of spectral disentangling ( hereafter spd ) and thus obtain the individual spectra of the component stars .",
    "this makes detailed spectroscopic analyses much more straightforward , and allows the study of the spectral characteristics of all components over wide wavelength ranges . to aid the comparison with theoretical evolutionary models of semi - detached binary systems , we have also considered other diagnostic species",
    "the primary target is nitrogen abundance , which is very sensitive to cno nucleosynthetic processes .",
    "theoretical models of binary star evolution have also been calculated for non - conservative mass transfer .",
    "a detailed description of our methodology was given in a study of the hot algol uher ( kolbas et al .",

    "improved measurement of the masses of all three components through spectral disentangling , with a special emphasis in studying the spectrum of a faint roche - lobe - filling component over a broad spectral range .",
    "secondly , spectroscopic determination of the effective temperature , abundance patterns and bulk metallicities from disentangled spectra of the individual components .",
    "our aim is to assemble useful observational constraints for comparison to evolutionary model calculations ; in particular , the first measurement of the bulk metallicity of the components of algol .",
    "we first summarise the rich observational history of algol , and highlight some recent observational results . in sect .  3 we present new chelle spectra of algol .",
    "4 covers the spd  of the spectra and the determination of new orbital elements for both inner and outer orbits .",
    "the analysis of the disentangled spectra for all three components is presented in sect .  5 , including detailed calculations of abundances for algol a and metallicity for algol c.",
    "the results are discussed in the context of mass transfer between algol a and b in sect .",

    "algol ( @xmath0persei , hd19356 ) is a hierarchical triple star system ( frieboes - conde et al .",
    "1970 ; sderhjelm 1980 ) .",
    "it is extremely bright ( @xmath18 ) and its periodic variability is the subject of a long observational history .",

    "the first well - documented discovery of the 2.867day periodicity , and an explanation in terms of stellar eclipses , was given by goodricke ( 1783 ) based on naked - eye observations .",
    "thanks to its brightness , algol also has a long history of observations with many techniques and at many wavelengths",
    ". an outstanding and exhaustive account of these studies was given by wecht ( 2006 ) .",
    "the inner pair consists of a late - b - type star in orbit with an early - k - type subgiant which fills its roche lobe .",
    "this close system exhibits partial eclipses , and is the prototype of the algol class of eclipsing binaries .",
    "a tertiary component pursues a 680d orbit around the inner pair ; its spectral classification has been variously given as late - a , early - f , and am . this description of algol emerged from decades of primarily spectroscopic and photometric studies ( cf .",
    "friebos - conde et al .  1970 ; hill et al .  1971 ; sderhjelm 1980 ; richards et al .  1988 ) .",
    "the main difficulty of these early studies was the intrinsic faintness of the cool subgiant , which is exacerbated by dilution due to the light of component c. algol c is brighter than algol b , but its contribution has previously been very difficult to quantify ( richards et al .",
    "a breakthrough came with its eventual spectroscopic detection in the infrared ( glusheva & esipov 1967 ) , and then radial velocity ( rv ) measurements which led to the determination of the dynamical masses for the components ( tomkin & lambert 1978 ) .",
    "other observational techniques have been helpful in constraining the orbital and physical characteristics of algol .",
    "rudy & kemp ( 1978 ) found phase - locked polarization and independently determined the inclination of the eclipsing binary .",
    "subsequently kemp et al .",
    "( 1983 ) discovered eclipse polarization , or the chandrasekhar effect , further evaluated by wilson & liou ( 1993 ) .",
    "the problem of the determination of the mutual orientations of the orbits in the algol system has remainined open ( kemp et al .  1981 ) .    since the successful detection of algol c with speckle interferometry ( labeyrie et al .   1974 )",
    ", algol has often been a target for interferometric measurements , which have recently settled the issue of the true orientation of both orbits .",
    "csizmadia et al .",
    "( 2009 ) spatially resolved the inner pair with long baseline interferometry in combination with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) radio observations .",
    "they found the inner orbit to be prograde , in disagreement with the retrograde movement found by lestrade et al .",
    "( 1993 ) from radio observations .",
    "this long - term controversy was solved by zavala et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who simultaneously resolved all three stellar components in the optical , achieving the then highest precision in angular measurements .",
    "the outer orbit was shown to be prograde and the inner orbit retrograde .",
    "vlba radio ( peterson et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ) and chara @xmath19-band measurements ( baron et al .  2012 ) subsequently confirmed these orientations for both orbits .",
    "the most recent highlight of the interferometric studies is an unambiguous spatial resolution of the three stars in the algol system with angular resolution @xmath200.5mas ( baron et al .",
    "this made possible the determination of the orbital and physical characteristics of the components ( angular sizes and mass ratios ) independently from previous studies .",
    "baron et al .",
    "( 2012 ) also determined the mutual inclination of the orbits to be much closer to perpendicularity than previously established .",
    "the distortion of the roche - lobe - filling component b is clearly seen in the reconstructed image .",
    "another highlight of recent work on algol is the first three - dimensional reconstruction of this system ( richards et al .",
    "these three - dimensional tomograms revealed previously undetected evidence of the mass transfer process , such as loop prominences and coronal mass ejections .",
    "early predictions of the superhump phenomenon in algol , i.e.  the gas between the stars in close pair being threaded with a magnetic field even though the hot mass - gaining star is not know to have a magnetic field ( retter et al .",
    "2005 ) have been supported by this new technique .",

    "the resolution of the instrument is roughly 3.5px , giving a resolving power of 48000 .",
    "an exposure time of 15s was used for all spectra , resulting in continuum s / n ratios in the region of 200500 in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands .    in order to cover the long - period outer orbit of algol ,",
    "spectroscopic observations were taken from 2009 to 2010 at the bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory ( boao ) , south korea .",
    "a set of 36 spectra were secured with bohyunsan optical chelle spectrograph ( boes ) mounted on the 1.8-m telescope ( kim et al .",
    "boes has multiple spectral resolving powers up to 80000 , and covers thee wavelength range 3600 to 10200 .",
    "a thorium - argon lamp was used for wavelength calibration and s / n ratios of 300550 were achieved .    the spectra were bias - subtracted , flat - fielded and extracted with the iraf chelle package routines .",
    "normalisation and merging of the orders was performed with great care , using custom programs , to ensure that these steps did not cause any systematic errors in the resulting spectra ( see appendix ) .",
    "the method of spd  enables determination of the orbital elements of binary and multiple systems , along with the simultaneous separation of the individual spectra of the components , in a self - consistent way ( simon & sturm 1994 ) . in that sense",
    "it is a generalisation of the doppler tomography method of bagnuolo & gies ( 1991 ) which was the first successful reconstruction of individual spectra for binary stars but which relies on predetermined rvs for the components for each spectrum . in spd",
    "only a time series of observed spectra are needed , with roughly uniform coverage of the rv motion of the stars ( cf .",
    "hensberge et al .   2008 ) .",
    "optimisation of the rvs is bypassed in favour of directly fitting for the orbital elements , as first implemented by simon & sturm ( 1994 ) .    with no need for input template spectra",
    ", spd  does not suffer from biases due to template mismatch ( cf .",
    "hensberge & pavlovski 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "however , no comprehensive study of the error propagation in spd  and comparison to cross - correlation has yet been undertaken .",
    "some initial studies have indicated the method is ` well - behaved ' ( hynes & maxted 1998 ; iliji et al .",
    "2001 ; hensberge & pavlovski 2007 ; southworth & clausen 2007 ) .",
    "the spd  of algol is challenging for the following reasons : ( i ) the system is triple ; ( ii ) the secondary component is barely discernable in the optical spectra ; ( iii ) the period of the outer orbit is long ( 680d ) ; and ( iv ) eclipse spectra could not be used due to significant distortion of the line profiles due to the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( rossiter 1924 ; mclaughlin 1924 ) .",
    "spectra of several multiple systems have previously been successfully separated using different variants of the spd  method ( cf .",

    "2010 ; kolbas et al .",
    "2012 ) we are pushing the limit of the method because of the extreme faintness of algol b ( see sect .",
    "the rotational distortion of the spectral lines during eclipse ( the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ) violates the principal assumption of spectral disentangling that spectral line profiles are not intrinsically variable , so spectra obtained during eclipse can not be used . without such spectra there is insufficient variation in the light contributions of the components during the orbit , so the zeroth mode in the fourier expansion is undetermined .",
    "this has the consequence that spectra can be only separated , and remain in the common continuum of the system .",
    "renormalisation of the separated spectra of the individual components is discussed further in sect .",
    "5.1 .    to perform spd",
    "we used the code fdbinary ( iliji et al .",
    "fdbinary implements disentangling in the fourier domain ( hadrava 1995 ) using fast fourier transforms , making it computationally efficient .",
    "it can also account for two orbits and three individual spectra , as is required for algol .",
    "five spectral segments were selected , paying particular attention to including enough spectral lines of algol b to allow its velocity semiamplitude to be precisely determined .",
    "for the blue spectral region this is challenging since the fractional light contribution is less than 1% ( see sect .  5.1 and fig .  2 ) .",

    "only spectra taken outside eclipse were used , giving a total of 112 input spectra . to limit the computational demand we also stacked spectra taken in close succession , resulting in a total of 49 input spectra .",
    "such spectra typically covered a time interval of 3min , for which the rv of algol b changes by a maximum of 0.5kms@xmath11 , so velocity smearing is not a problem .",

    "extracted and wavelength - calibrated chelle spectra ( sect .  2 ) are split into orders , each of which has a response function determined by the blaze shape . in each order ,",
    "the intensity of signal smoothly rises from the edges to the centre of frame .",
    "it is due to the optical setup and characteristics of chelle spectrograph , and has sine form ( see barker 1984 ) .",
    "blaze function removal from extracted spectral orders is a critical step in the reduction of chelle spectra .",
    "any systematic errors in the blaze function correction produces periodic ripples in the shape of the continuum , which in turn affects the depth and thus equivalent widths of spectral lines . a major obstacle to removal of the blaze function",
    "is the presence of broad spectral lines , in particular balmer lines in late - b and early - a stars .",
    "these can be wider than a single spectral order , so determining the blaze function using points on the spectral continuum is impossible .",
    "the most widespread method to correct for the blaze function is to divide the spectrum with a blaze function obtained from flat - fields ( c.f .",
    "erspamer & north 2002 ; koda et al .",
    "2008 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , this often gives a wavy shape in the merged spectral orders , which then still have to be locally normalised .",
    "for unknown reasons blaze functions of stellar and flat - field spectra are not identical , and undesired ripples appear and degrade the quality of merged spectra .",
    "one of the most important prerequisites for spectral disentangling is the quality of the normalised merged chelle spectra . to avoid systematic errors , we remove blaze functions in more thorough and interactive way .",
    "first , the spectral orders suitable for fitting of the blaze function are selected ( in fig .",
    "a1 these are orders # 39 , and 42 ) .",
    "these are orders without broad spectral lines and with a substantial amount of continuum .",
    "high - degree polynomial functions are fitted by least - squares through selected continuum points .",
    "wavelengths of maximum intensity of the blaze functions are also calculated , and used for the interpolation of the positions of blaze function head in the remaining orders .",
    "blaze functions are now interpolated to these orders , as illustrated the upper panel of fig .",
    "the results of the correction using interpolated blaze functions are shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "a1 illustrates the quality of interpolation and merging between two sequential orders containing a balmer line .",
    "it should be emphasized that overlapping parts fall on the edges of spectral orders , and suffer a lower s / n than central parts . despite this , merging is good to much better than 1% ."
