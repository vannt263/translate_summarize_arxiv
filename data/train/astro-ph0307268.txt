    "objects with masses below the substellar mass limit ( @xmath8@xmath9 ) fail to stabilize on the main - sequence and cool down to very low temperatures .",
    "their observational study has started only recently , but it is progressing vigorously .",
    "a focus point in the research about substellar mass objects ( smos ) is the minimum mass that free - floating objects in young clusters and associations can have .",
    "particularly , it has been suggested that the faintest and coolest objects discovered through deep imaging in orion have masses below the deuterium - burning limit at 0.013@xmath9  or @xmath10 14@xmath6 , where 1 @xmath9  = 1047 @xmath6 ( lucas & roche 2000 ; zapatero osorio et al .",
    "2000 ; lucas et al .",
    "such mass limit has been used in the literature to distinguish between brown dwarfs ( bds ) and planets ( burrows et al .",
    "another mass limit that has been discussed lies at 4@xmath6 , where the interior equation of state changes from being dominated by electron degeneracy pressure to having a significant contribution by metallic hydrogen ( liebert s contribution in boss et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this paper",
    "we adopt the d - burning limit as the dividing line between bds and planets , so that we are consistent with our previous work in this cluster .",
    "smos have also been found orbiting main - sequence stars .",
    "the mass distribution of companions to low - mass main - sequence stars within 3  au shows that smos with masses between 70 and 20@xmath6  are rare , but their frequency increases below about 10@xmath6  ( queloz , santos and mayor 2002 ) . on the other hand",
    ", there are indications that bds may be frequent at large separations from stars ( gizis et al . 2000 ; potter et al . 2002 ) .",
    "theoretical work has shown that it is possible that planetary mass companions to stars form by gravitational collapse rather than by agglomeration of planetesimals ( boss 2001 ; bate , bonnell & bromm 2003 ) .",
    "this scenario would seem more plausible if there were also free - floating planets that have directly formed from the collapse and fragmentation of molecular clouds , or that have been ejected by interactions with stars and other smos .",
    "the @xmath1orionis   cluster is a prime location to search for smos because of its young age ( @xmath103  myr ) , distance ( @xmath10440  pc ) and low reddening ( sherry 2003 ) .",
    "a cluster of x - ray emitting young stars was discovered by walter , wolk & sherry ( 1998 ) .",
    "a sequence of smos has been found extending to masses below the d - burning limit ( zapatero osorio et al .",
    "2000 ; bjar et al .",
    "the coolest and faintest object so far detected in any young cluster or association is sori70 ( zapatero osorio et al . 2002 ) . in this paper",
    "we report spectroscopic observations of sori70 that have more than a factor of 10 higher spectral resolution than our previous data .",
    "we use the higher resolution spectrum to improve previous estimates of the gravity and temperature by fitting with synthetic spectra .",
    "we confirm that sori70 has a low gravity , which strongly supports its membership in the @xmath1orionis   cluster .",
    "on 2002 november 24th , we observed sorij053810.1 - 023626 ( hereafter sori70 ) with the keck  ii near - infrared spectrometer nirspec ( mclean et al .",
    "meteorological conditions were slightly non - photometric ( occasional light cirruses ) and the seeing ranged from 0.6 arcsec to 0.9 arcsec , as measured in the nirspec images .",
    "total exposure times were 4200s and 600s for the @xmath11-band spectra of sori70 ( j=20.28 , zapatero osorio et al . 2002 ) and 2massj0559191 - 140449 , respectively .",
    "the latter object is a relatively bright t5 dwarf ( j=13.82 , burgasser et al .",
    "the observing strategy employed for sori70 was as follows : two individual integrations of 600s at three different positions along the entrance slit separated by about 13 .",
    "an additional exposure of 600s was obtained at one of the positions .",
    "only two single integrations of 300s were collected for 2massj0559191 - 140449 . in order to remove telluric absorptions due to the terrestrial atmosphere , the near - infrared featureless a0v - type stars hd15820 and hd63817 were observed very close in airmass ( typically within 0.05 airmasses ) .",
    "white light calibration images were taken at the beginning and at the end of the observing night .",
    "raw data were reduced within iraf and following standard techniques in the near - infrared",
    ". nodded images were subtracted to remove the sky background and dark current .",
    "the object spectra were then optimally extracted using subroutines of the twodspec package .",
    "the extracted spectra were divided by their corresponding normalized extracted flat - fields .",
    "wavelength calibration ( @xmath12=3 ) was performed using 33 oh sky emission lines .",
    "the hydrogen p@xmath13 absorption line at 1.2818@xmath0 m in the spectra of the a0v - type stars was interpolated before the corresponding science spectra were divided by them to cancel terrestrial features . to complete the data reduction",
    ", we multiplied the spectra of our targets by the black body spectrum for the temperature of 9480k , which corresponds to the a0v class ( allen 2000 ) .",
    "our final nirspec spectrum of sori70 is shown in figure  1 .",
    "it has a resolving power of r=1500 .",
    "we also show the spectrum of 2massj0559191 - 140449 obtained the same night .",
    "the shape of the spectra are different , indicating different physical conditions in the photosphere .",
    "lucas et al . ( 2001 ) showed that triangular shapes in near - infrared spectra of l dwarfs could be explained by the low gravity of smos in the trapezium . in the next section",
    "we analyze these conditions using theoretical tools .",
    "we find that the triangular shape of the j - band spectrum of sori70 is caused by a surface gravity lower than that of 2massj0559191 - 140449 , consistent with having a larger radius as expected for a younger object .",
    "in our analysis we use synthetic spectra for t dwarfs that have been developed by allard et al .",
    "they include the total condensation of dust grains below the photosphere ( cond models ) and the latest ames list of h@xmath14o lines ( partridge & schwenke 1997 ) .",
    "these models reproduce well the blue near - infrared colors of t dwarfs in the @xmath1orionis   cluster ( martn et al . 2001",
    "; zapatero osorio et al . 2002 ) . in figure  2",
    ", we show the effects of different surface gravities in the synthetic spectra calculated with cond atmospheric models .",
    "a triangular shape is expected to develop for lower gravities due to enhanced methane and steam absorption .",
    "the strength of the ki doublet at 1.25 microns is also greater for lower gravities .",
    "our nirspec spectrum of sori70 has been compared with a grid of theoretical spectra using a least square minimization technique .",
    "the best fit is shown in figure  3 .",
    "it was obtained for a cond model with @xmath15=1100k and log@xmath16=3.5cms@xmath3 .",
    "we estimate that the internal 1@xmath1 uncertainty of our fitting technique is @xmath5k and @xmath20.5cms@xmath3 , respectively .    using the spectroscopically derived surface gravity and temperature , we can place sori70 in an evolutionary diagram that distance independent ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the object lies on the 3  myr isochrone for a mass of 3 jupiters using the evolutionary models of burrows et al .",
    "a similar result was obtained from the models of chabrier et al .",
    "higher mass , older t dwarfs , have higher gravities , such as those inferred for the t dwarfs gl229b and gl570d , also shown in figure  4 . if sori70 were a brown dwarf in the line of sight to the @xmath1orionis   cluster , it should have a higher gravity .",
    "the low gravity of this object implies a very young age that is fully consistent with the cluster s age ( bjar et al .",
    "2001 ; oliveira et al .",
    "2002 ; sherry 2003 ) .",
    "for very young ages ( @xmath171  myr ) , the ages and masses derived from evolutionary models may depend strongly on the initial conditions assumed in the calculations ( baraffe et al .",
    "however , at an age of 3  myr , the models used to obtain the age and mass of sori70 are thought to be safely independent of the initial conditions .",
    "spectroscopic analysis of gravity sensitive features has been recognized as a powerful tool to estimate the masses of smos ( davidge & boeshaar 1991 ) . as they contract with time , the gravity of smos changes by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "very young smos have low gravities ( log  g@xmath103.0 ) , while old ones have high gravities ( log  g@xmath105.5 ) .",
    "the strengths of the molecular absorption bands increase with decreasing surface gravity because of changes in the temperature structure of the atmosphere . at lower gravity a larger column abundance of molecules",
    "is required to compress the atmosphere to a given pressure .",
    "spectral synthesis analysis of observed spectra have confirmed that lower gravity objects with late - m and l spectral types have stronger molecular bands ( allard et al .",
    "2001 ; basri et al .",
    "2000 ; gorlova et al .",
    "2003 ; leggett et al . 2001 ; lucas et al . 2001 ; mohanty et al . 2003 ; schweitzer et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "as shown in figure  2 , gravity effects are also significant in the spectrum of t dwarfs .",
    "sori70 is currently the coolest object identified in any cluster ( zapatero osorio et al .",
    "consequently , it deserves particular attention because it indicates that there could be a numerous population of planetary members of clusters .",
    "the estimated mass of sori70 overlaps with the masses of planetary companions to stars , giving an impetus to the ideas that giant planets form by rapid gravitational processes that happen in molecular cloud cores , disks , and filaments ( boss 2001 ; bate , bonnell & bromm 2003 ) .",
    "the angular distance of sori70 from the naked - eye o9.5v star @xmath1 ori ( hr 1931 ) is 8.65 , corresponding to a projected separation of 182676  au at 352  pc .",
    "this star is actually a quintuple system where the most distant companion is a b2 star at 42 \" .",
    "the total mass of these 5 stars is about 60  m@xmath18 .",
    "the maximum separation of binaries with o - type primaries is about 110000  au ( abt 1986 ) .",
    "thus , the separation from the star @xmath1 ori to the planetary object sori70 is of the same order of magnitude as the widest binaries with o - type primaries .    could sori70 be part of a planetary system surrounding the massive multiple stellar system ? .",
    "circumbinary disks are know to exist around low - mass stars ( e.g. , potter et al . 2000 )",
    ". however , it is not known whether very large disk structures could exist around high - mass multiple stars .",
    "a dusty proto - planetary disk without a central star has recently been discovered at only 1200  au from @xmath1 ori ( van loon & oliveira 2003 ) , suggesting that planetary formation is still ongoing in this region . however , the typical separation between stars in the @xmath1orionis   cluster is about 50000  au .",
    "in fact , there are 3 brown dwarfs and one star within 65000  au of sori70 .",
    "we conclude that sori70 is likely a planetary member in the cluster , but not particularly bound to any star or brown dwarf . could sori70 have been ejected from an unstable multiple stellar or planetary system ? .",
    "we do not have kinematic information so we can not constrain this hypothesis .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the escape velocity from the cluster ( vesc=0.65  km / s ) is lower than the typical ejection velocities produced in the simulations of bate et al .",
    "most ejections occur very early in the evolution of the unstable systems ( age@xmath190.1  myr ) , so it is unlikely that sori70 has been recently ejected .",
    "the presence of planetary members in open clusters that are not bound to any particular star opens a new perspective to the diversity of planets in the universe .",
    "a matter of ongoing debate is the most suitable nomenclature for planetary objects that are not orbiting solar - type stars .",
    "we adhere to a wide use of the term `` planet '' that includes all objects that do not develop nuclear reactions in their cores , independently of where they may be found or how they formed .",
    "qualifiers may be added to specify the environmental conditions , such as `` pulsar planets '' , `` solar - system planets '' , and `` close - in planets '' which have already been used in the literature .",
    "we propose to call planets such as sori70 , which are located in a star cluster but do not orbit any particular star , `` cluster planets '' .",
    "our proposition differs from the definition of the iau working group on extrasolar planets ( boss et al .",
    "2003 ) , which states that : `` free - floating objects in young star clusters with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not planets , but are sub - brown dwarfs ( or whatever name is most appropriate ) . ''",
    "cluster planets are probably numerous in the galaxy as suggested by the imf presented in bjar et al .",
    "the @xmath1orionis   cluster is probably not bound because it does not have enough mass ( sherry 2003 ) .",
    "thus , cluster planets become `` free - floating planets '' after several million years .",
    "free - floating planets are likely to populate the solar neighborhood .",
