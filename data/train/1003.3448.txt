    "recent years have seen enormous progress in the discovery and measurement of the tiny dwarf satellite galaxies of the local group .",
    "these include the long known , `` classical '' dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite as well as the more recently discovered `` ultrafaint '' dwarfs and the satellites of m31 @xcite .",
    "in addition to identifying these systems , kinematic data from measuring the velocities of individual stars has become available for many systems .",
    "these now consist of thousands of individual stars for the classical dwarfs @xcite , with rapidly improving data for the other types of systems @xcite .",
    "the local group dwarfs appear to be the most dark matter dominated objects in the universe @xcite , consistent with the trend of dark matter domination increasing with decreasing surface brightness @xcite . as such",
    ", they provide a unique probe of structure formation at the smallest accessible scales .",
    "they presumably reside in the sub - halos thought to inhabit the large dark matter halos of galaxies like the milky way ( mw ) and m31 .",
    "if so , physical processes specific to their environment , like tidal disruption and ram pressure stripping , may play a role in the evolution of the luminous content of the dwarfs as they orbit the primary structure .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate whether , and the extent to which , the dwarfs obey the scaling relations established for brighter galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we investigate how the dwarfs behave in the baryonic tully - fisher plane .",
    "rotating disk galaxies define a tight relation between baryonic mass and rotation velocity @xcite .",
    "this has recently been extended @xcite to low rotation velocities ( @xmath1 ) comparable to the local group dwarf spheroidals .",
    "an obvious question is whether the local group dwarfs that are satellites of the mw and m31 continue this relation .",
    "we adopt the data compilation of @xcite for the mw satellites augmented by the recent data for m31 dwarfs presented by @xcite .",
    "these are small , pressure supported systems @xcite whose baryonic mass is in the form of stars . in order to place them on the same baryonic tully - fisher relation ( btfr ) as rotating disks we need to estimate stellar mass and rotation velocity in a consistent manner .",

    "this corresponds to deviation by at least an order of magnitude ( @xmath250 ) .",
    "if a population of as - yet undiscovered ultrafaint dsphs exist with large dispersions and extremely low surface brightnesses @xcite , we expect them to deviate still farther from the btfr .",
    "hercules is an interesting case .",
    "it either deviates or it does not , depending on which published velocity dispersion we adopt . for consistency with @xcite , we use here the velocity dispersion @xmath251 found by @xcite . for this @xmath227 , hercules deviates substantially from the btfr , being off by a factor @xmath252 in mass , with a 68% confidence interval @xmath253 .",
    "put this way , it would seem safe to say that it deviates by an order of magnitude . however , if instead we adopt the more recent measurement of @xmath254 reported by @xcite , we find @xmath255 with a 68% confidence interval @xmath256 .",
    "the central value again deviates by a large factor , and the uncertainties in the two measurements overlap .",
    "however , the @xmath257 boundaries now encompass the btfr , so we would no longer consider this to be a deviant case .",
    "the case of hercules illustrates an important point . a small and formally consistent difference ( @xmath258 in this case )",
    "can have an impact on how we perceive the the results under consideration here .",
    "it is therefore important to take the formally significant deviations with a grain of salt .",
    "this is a rapidly evolving field ; even with heroic efforts the velocity dispersion data for the ultrafaint dwarfs are not of the same quality as those for the classical dwarfs , nor can they be given the small number of stars in these systems .",
    "given the cautionary tale of hercules , one possible interpretation is that there are no real deviations from the btfr .",
    "this hypothesis predicts that the scatter will decrease as the data improve , with the more deviant cases migrating towards the btfr .",
    "there is room to improve the data by weeding out nonmember stars @xcite and binaries @xcite , both of which inflate @xmath227 . measuring proper motions to constrain anisotropies will give a more accurate assessment of @xmath259 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "of course , we must also consider the degree to which it is appropriate to compare @xmath227 measured at small radii in dwarfs to @xmath259 measured at large radii in disk galaxies .",
    "there are substantial difficulties with attributing all deviations from the btfr to errors .",
    "one is their sheer magnitude : the discrepancies @xmath260 are an order of magnitude in some cases , and two orders of magnitude for some of the ultrafaint dwarfs . in the most extreme case ,",
    "segue 1 , @xmath261 . to place this object on",
    "the btfr would require that its baryonic mass increase by this factor . alternatively ,",
    "since the btfr is steep , a reduction in the observed @xmath262 @xcite to @xmath263 would also suffice . while a @xmath264 change may be conceivable in one object , it would have to happen in numerous cases",
    ". moreover , the residuals are asymmetric : many more systems have @xmath265 than @xmath266 .",
    "this asymmetry is larger than indicated by the formal errors , though we caution that the errors are asymmetric in the same sense .",
    "as always , a systematic error could be responsible , such as the inflation of @xmath227 by binaries .",
    "any such systematic would have to similarly affect many different objects observed by a number of independent groups while not affecting the objects that do adhere to the btfr .",
    "another problem with attributing deviations from the btfr entirely to uncertainties is that the residuals correlate with the physical properties of the dwarfs ( figs .",
    "[ resid_a ] and [ resid_b ] ) .",
    "it seems unlikely that the observed correlations are mere flukes . if not",
    ", they will persist as data continue to accumulate .",
    "if the btfr is a property shared by isolated galaxies when initially formed , we might seek to reconcile the local group satellites with it by extracting baryons before they form stars .",
    "mechanisms to do this come in a variety of flavors . in this section",
    "we consider astrophysical effects that systematically suppress the cooling or retention of gas in dwarfs .",
    "the reionization of the universe at @xmath267 is one mechanism by which the formation of stars in low mass halos might be suppressed .",
    "reionization heats the gas , inhibiting further star formation in small halos ( @xmath268 at the time of reinoization : see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "halos that remain this small may never experience further star formation , persisting as `` fossil '' dwarfs containing only ancient stars @xcite .    the results of simulations @xcite are compared to the data in fig .",
    "[ fdvlg ] . here",
    "we plot the detected baryon fraction , which is the fraction of baryons @xmath269 that are detected in any given halo relative to the cosmic baryon fraction @xmath270 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath271 differs from the btfr residual @xmath260 .",
    "reionization models like those of @xcite and @xcite result in a sharp truncation of the cold baryon content of halos at a particular mass scale . above this mass scale",
    ", reionization does nothing to prevent the baryons from cooling and forming stars .",
    "in contrast , the data deviate smoothly and gradually from the universal baryon fraction , not abruptly as suggested by models consisting of reionization only .",
    "thus , while the model of @xcite appears to work well for @xmath272 , it does not explain dwarf irregulars with @xmath273 .",
    "at this slightly larger scale , reionization is not expected to impede the condensation of cool gas and subsequent star formation , yet the mass of baryons detected in the form of stars and cold gas is an order of magnitude shy of the cosmic baryon fraction .",
    "we might suppose that there is some fundamental difference between dsph and dirr galaxies that separately determines their location in fig .",
    "[ fdvlg ] . however , the continuity of the btfr to most of the classical dwarf spheroidals suggests a common origin .",
    "it appears that physics beyond reionization is needed to explain the observed trend in detected baryon fraction @xmath271 with halo mass .",
    "reionization might act in addition to whatever physics drives the main trend in fig .",
    "[ fdvlg ] by causing a sharp low - velocity ) that persist in following the btfr , especially if they were gas rich . ] cut - off .",
    "this might explain the residual correlation with luminosity exhibited by the ultrafaint dwarfs ( at least those with @xmath274 in fig .",
    "[ resid_a ] ) . however , it does nothing to explain the trend of the residuals with ellipticity ( fig .",
    "[ resid_b ] ) .",
    "stellar feedback is frequently invoked as a mechanism to remove gas from galaxies or inhibit its accretion in the first place .",
    "intense radiation from young stars ( perhaps pop .",
    "iii stars at early times , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may heat the surrounding gas and prevent its infall .",
    "winds driven by supernovae following intense bursts of star formation may impart sufficient mechanical energy into the interstellar medium to sweep up and expel substantial amounts of gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in either case , the prodigious energy produced by massive , short - lived stars is invoked to alter the global properties of galaxies .",
    "these ideas go back to at least @xcite and have been invoked many times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one appealing aspect of this picture is that the energy injected by star formation events depends on the local star formation efficiency , while the ability of a halo to retain baryons depends on the depth of its potential well .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect a trend like that seen in fig .",
    "[ fdvlg ] with the retained baryon fraction increasing with halo mass .",
    "star formation happens in a local way , but global baryon retention becomes increasingly difficult in smaller galaxies .",
    "when the potential well becomes very shallow , as is the case for dwarf spheroidals , stochastic effects may come to dominate completely such that @xmath260 varies widely at a given @xmath259 .    while qualitatively attractive , quantitative implementation of feedback in realistic simulations is notoriously difficult ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the gas physics is uncertain , and even the depth of the potential well is unclear . in the @xmath0cdm  structure formation paradigm ,",
    "large galaxies are constructed from the mergers of smaller ones .",
    "the trend of @xmath271 with potential well depth only follows naturally if most of the star formation activity responsible for the feedback takes place after the establishment of the bulk of the potential well depth as indicated by the circular velocity measured now .",
    "if instead much of the action occurs in small protogalactic clumps before the establishment of the large halos we imagine to retain the gas , it becomes less obvious that the ultimate potential well depth is relevant .",
    "indeed , as our nearest examples of the fossils of protogalactic clumps , the large scatter in luminosity and @xmath271 at a given mass exemplified by the dwarf spheroidals more nearly represents the stochastic mess that we would naturally expect from this process .    given that stellar feedback is a stochastic process , any relation that it establishes will likely have a great deal of scatter . in the context of the local group dwarfs ,",
    "this is quite reasonable : there is a lot of scatter about the btfr ( fig .",
    "[ mbv ] ) .",
    "this does not persist to larger masses ( @xmath275 ) . for the gas dominated late type disks populating fig .",
    "[ fdvlg ] @xcite , the data are consistent with a relation with nearly zero intrinsic width .",

    "another mechanism capable of removing cold gas before it can form stars is ram pressure stripping . in this hypothesis",

    "first , the amount by which a dwarf deviates from the btfr is an indicator of the infall epoch .",
    "the earlier it fell in , the sooner gas was stripped and star formation truncated . secondly , because of the truncation of star formation , the age of the stars should also correlate with the factor by which the dwarf deviates .",
    "dwarfs that fell in early should contain only old stars .",
    "a natural corollary is that the stars in the first dwarfs to fall in should be low metallicity . indeed , since these objects would have had little time to self - enrich , we would expect the [ @xmath277/fe ] ratios to be enhanced while [ fe / h ] is low .",
    "we would thus expect [ @xmath277/fe ] to correlate with the residuals @xmath260 .",
    "the degree of deviance @xmath260 should reflect the order of infall .",

    "hercules , canes venatici , draco , and ursa minor are relative newcomers , while leo t , which is the only mw dsph with detectable hi gas , has yet to be stripped .",
    "the prediction that deviance correlates with infall time is not perfect , as it depends on the star formation history of the dwarf prior to infall .",

    "however , no star formation can persist after ram pressure stripping is complete .",

    "the dwarfs with recent star formation episodes are merely the most recent to have fallen in and had their gas stripped away .    for this process to be generic , the halos of host galaxies need to contain a good deal of hot gas .",

    "this might suffice to mask the effect , though an investigation of the impact of different environments on the btfr would clearly be interesting .",
    "ram pressure stripping potentially provides a good way to strip gas at an appropriate time to allow for recent star formation in some dwarf spheroidals that possess no cold gas now .",

    "if this were the case , the dwarfs should have disintegrated long ago .",
    "a second possibility is that @xmath297 is correct and the observed dwarfs are not yet the parents of any streams .",
    "the streams observed in the halo would have been produced by the dissolution of other dwarfs .",

    "the typical dwarf is not currently close to its pericenter , but may bear the scars of its close passages in the form of reduced luminosity and deviation from the btfr . in this case",
    "we imagine that the streams in the halo have been built up by stars lost during successive pericenter passages .",
    "this last possibility provides an appealing explanation for the correlation of @xmath260 with ellipticity as well as luminosity .",

    "such an evolution will not reproduce the trend observed here , which requires a more rapid loss of luminosity with respect to velocity dispersion .",

    "these stars should have properties consistent with the parent body : their ages and abundance patters should be consistent with the same distributions .",
    "the streams should be in orbits identifiable with their parents .",
    "it appears likely that stars would largely be liberated during pericenter passage , so there is in principle a further prediction about the phase at which stars were injected into the stream .",
    "pericenter passage is a brief portion of the orbit , so we would not expect any of the observed dwarfs to currently be in the process of losing stars . at their present galactocentric distances , all of the dwarfs should be safely bound in what remains of their dark matter cocoons .",
    "observation of streams being liberated at present would require some further interpretation (   [ mond ] ) .    in order to liberate stars as envisioned under the stellar stripping hypothesis ,",
    "the disrupting satellites need to be on highly elliptical orbits . though we do not yet know the orbits of all the dwarfs , there are some constraints .",
    "carina has @xmath304 @xcite and ursa minor has @xmath305 @xcite .",
    "carina adheres to the btfr but ursa minor does not , so their observed orbits are the opposite of what we would expect in this hypothesis . while disfavored , a pericenter passage that is sufficiently small ( @xmath306 kpc ) to liberate some stars from ursa minor is not yet excluded by the orbital data @xcite .",
    "even if this were the case it would remain curious that ursa minor deviates from the btfr and carina does not .",

    "the gas dominated dwarf irregular galaxies studied by @xcite and @xcite fall along the btfr , consistent with mond .",
    "indeed , this is confirmation of a prediction that has zero free parameters : the gas mass dominates @xmath299 and these galaxies fall along the mond prediction , which is indistinguishable from the best fit btfr .    the deviation of the local group dwarf satellites from the btfr would appear to falsify mond @xcite .",
    "however , the local group dwarf satellites are not isolated . in mond ,",

    "neither condition is satisfied in sagittarius , which is highly elliptical and far from equilibrium .    for the classical dwarfs excluding draco and ursa minor , the inferred mass - to - light ratios are reasonable for stellar populations @xcite .",
    "@xcite even find that lower mass - to - light ratios tend to occur in dwarfs with more recent star forming events , as expected from a stellar populations perspective .",
    "this is not trivial , as the mass - to - light ratio computed in mond is _ extremely _ sensitive to the accuracy of the data simply because the mass depends on a high power of the velocity dispersion .",

    "the assumption that the dwarfs are in dynamical equilibrium is perhaps more consequential .",
    "if they are , they should not exhibit discrepancies of one or two orders of magnitude .",
    "if they are not , then mond may become similar to the stellar stripping hypothesis (   [ starstrip ] ) , though not identical .",
    "tidal forces are stronger in mond than in conventional gravity @xcite as the long range boost to the effective force becomes more important than the extra dark mass @xcite .",

    "satellites reaching @xmath347 near the pericenters of their orbits puff up in size and decline in velocity dispersion , but recover as they recede .",
    "satellites that enter the regime @xmath348 experience unchecked growth in size , subjecting them to tidal disruption and the formation of tidal streams .",
    "the velocity dispersions of these systems initially decline but then grow .",
    "this is qualitatively the right vector for an evolutionary track that would explain the deviations from the btfr , but considerably more work would be required to predict such a track or even to check how sensitive the evolution is to parameters such as orbital eccentricity .",
    "[ orbits ] shows the deviations from the btfr and the ellipticity of the dwarfs plotted as a function of @xmath341 computed at the half light radius .",
    "correlations with both are apparent .",
    "the deviation sets in around @xmath349 , consistent with the above reasoning .",
    "the most distorted dwarfs are those with the least time to react to changes in the external field .",
    "dwarfs with large @xmath341 have many orbits to adjust to changes in the potential ; these objects are mostly round .",
    "while it may be possible to avoid distorting the shapes of dwarfs via tides when they are protected by a cocoon of dark matter @xcite , tidal distortion seems inevitable in mond @xcite .",
    "we note that the plot of the deviations in fig .  [ orbits ] is very similar to fig .",
    "[ tidalr ] .",
    "one interesting difference is the case of leo t , which is in the pure mond regime .",
    "consequently , it executes fewer internal orbits per external orbit than it would if it were in the quasi - newtonian regime like the rest of the dwarfs .",
    "this moves it closer to the clump of dwarfs that adhere to the btfr in fig .",
    "[ orbits ] than in fig .",
    "[ tidalr ] .",
    "we also note that leo t is the only dwarf considered here that retains gas .",
    "tides can strip gas , with the consequences discussed in  [ rampress ]",
    ". it may therefore be significant that all of the remaining dwarfs are dominated by the external field of the host .",
    "the absence of gas in dwarfs within @xmath350 kpc might be a signature of the transition to domination by the external field in mond .",
    "the structure of figs .  [ tidalr ] and fig .",
    "[ orbits ] should be similar in mond , but this behavior is not guaranteed .",
    "it only follows if the mond formula for @xmath341 ( equation  [ mondadiabat ] ) provides the correct timescale .",
    "this would not follow had we used a newtonian estimator for the timescale , either with dark matter or without . with dark matter , orbits within the dwarfs are more rapid thanks to the extra mass , and they always have time to equilibrate ( @xmath351 ) . without dark matter in the dwarfs themselves ,",
    "the dark matter halos of the hosts dominate and the dwarfs should dissolve rapidly ( @xmath352 ) . only when we use the baryonic mass for both dwarf and host in equation  ( [ mondadiabat ] ) does the onset of the deviation from the btfr correspond to when internal and external orbital timescales are comparable .",
    "this is one sense in which the external field effect is unique to mond , and appears to be consistent with the data for the mw dwarf spheroidals .",
    "a separate question is whether the number of dwarfs currently near total dissolution is reasonable . by reasonable , we mean a dissolution timescale that is shorter than a hubble time so that there is time for deviation from the btfr to have occurred , but not so short that we must be catching them at a special time .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear what the dissolution timescale is ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the trends in fig .",
    "5 are suggestive of progressive mass loss , but we do not know what the mass loss rate is , so can not quantify @xmath353 . as a proxy , we can estimate the crossing time @xmath354 .",
    "presumably it takes a number of crossing times for a dwarf to dissolve , though it is unclear how many .",
    "most dwarfs have @xmath355 years .",
    "the mw satellite with the longest crossing time is sextans ( @xmath356 gyr ) , which is a fair fraction of its orbital period ( @xmath357 gyr if @xmath358 ) .",
    "this object provides an interesting constraint , as it has had time to complete four circular orbits and a dozen crossing times in a hubble time .",
    "this seems like plenty of time for a low @xmath341 system so close to its tidal radius to have suffered some damage , and yet it remains consistent with the btfr .",
    "if instead it is in a somewhat eccentric orbit that only now places it in the regime of tidal susceptibility , its crossing time is long enough that perhaps we do not ( yet ) see deviation in this case simply because the system has not had time to react . on the opposite extreme ,",
    "the smallest of the ultrafaint dwarfs , segue 1 and willman 1 , have the shortest crossing times : @xmath359 years .",
    "this is uncomfortably short .",
    "both are far from the btfr , so perhaps have been caught just before total dissolution .",
    "nevertheless , these cases would appear to pose a dissolution timescale problem .",
    "it is hard to say how severe this problem is without knowledge of the initial population .",
    "the mass function is not known in mond , nor is it even clear whether the dwarfs are primordial or tidal in origin @xcite .",
    "the properties of the deviant dwarfs provide a strong test of the mond hypothesis .",
    "if they are stable , undisturbed systems , then their mass - to - light ratios are unacceptably large and mond fails . if instead they are being tidally stripped , this situation is naturally understood in the context of mond for which the tidal radii are comparable to the luminous size .",
    "this differs from the stellar stripping hypothesis in the dark matter context in that tidal disruption should be going on now for the deviant dwarfs , and not just when the dwarfs are near the pericenters of their orbits .",
    "in addition , the fact that the tidal radii of the dwarfs seem to be adequately estimated by assuming @xmath360 implies that their orbits are not highly eccentric . the distribution of orbital eccentricities of the dwarfs may therefore provide another test to distinguish mond from @xmath0cdm .",
    "we have examined the adherence of the local group dwarf satellites of the milky way and m31 to the baryonic tully - fisher relation .",
    "we find that most of the brighter dwarfs are largely consistent with the extrapolation of the btfr fitted to isolated , late type , gas rich , rotating disk galaxies .",
    "the fainter dwarfs , especially the ultrafaint dwarfs , are not .",
    "more importantly , we find that residuals from the btfr are not random , correlating well with luminosity and ellipticity .",
    "the amount of deviation from the btfr also correlates with metallicity , size , and the susceptibility of the dwarfs to tidal perturbation .",
    "we have considered a number of possible interpretations for the observed behavior , as we summarize below .",
    "heroic efforts have been made to find new dwarfs and to measure their velocity dispersions .",
    "this is a challenging endeavor . while the deviations of some dwarfs from the btfr are formally significant , that significance is not overwhelming ( typically 2 to @xmath361 ) .",
    "moreover , the analysis assumes that the dwarfs are spherical and in stable equilibrium .",
    "the assumption of sphericity at least is violated for the most deviant dwarfs .",
    "we therefore consider one possibility to be that there are no genuine deviations from the btfr .",
    "this hypothesis predicts that as the data improve , so too will agreement with the btfr .",
    "dwarfs that deviate from the btfr do so in the sense that they seem to be lacking luminosity for their velocity dispersion .",
    "this may be explained if baryons are removed before they form stars .",
    "several possible mechanisms to accomplish this removal include the suppression of star formation by cosmic reionization , ionization from pop .",
    "iii stars , removal of cold gas by supernova feedback , and ram pressure stripping .",
    "cosmic reionization is often invoked in the context of the dwarf spheroidals , and is an attractive solution if only these objects are considered .",
    "if we simultaneously consider slightly larger gas dominated disk galaxies , it becomes clear that reionization is not in itself an adequate explanation for the observed trends in the data .",
    "some other mechanism must be acting to suppress the accumulation of cold baryons in a manner that becomes more severe with decreasing @xmath259 .",
    "whatever this mechanism is , it presumably affects the dwarf spheroidals as well .",
    "cosmic reionization may be an additional factor acting only at scales @xmath272 .",
    "feedback from supernovae is a candidate mechanism for affecting star formation across all halo masses .",
    "this provides a qualitatively appealing explanation for the trend in the detected baryon fraction with halo mass .",
    "supernovae provide the kinetic energy to drive gas beyond escape velocity , but the escape velocity increases with increasing halo mass so progressively more baryons are retained .",
    "this mechanism may provide a natural explanation for the residual correlation with luminosity and metallicity .",
    "however , quantitative tests remain wanting , as does an explanation for the correlations of the residuals with ellipticity and tidal susceptibility .    in the ram pressure stripping hypothesis",
    ", galaxies deviate from the btfr when they fall into the halo of the current host galaxy and their cold gas is ablated by the ram pressure of the hot gas in the halo .",
    "this hypothesis requires that a sufficient amount of hot gas be present in the halos of the host galaxies , which is not obviously the case .",
    "it predicts that the ages of stars in the dwarfs is related to the time of infall , with the dwarfs that fall in first losing the most gas , deviating by the largest amount from the btfr , and having the oldest stars . strictly speaking",
    ", the star formation history of the pre - infall dwarf is not constrained , so there should be some scatter in these predictions .",
    "however , no star formation can occur after infall and gas stripping , so the ages of the youngest stars should correspond well to the time of infall with a sharp truncation in star formation after that time .",
    "this would provide a natural explanation for why some dwarfs appear to have had relatively recent star forming events but now contain no cold gas .",
    "one would also expect the metallicities of the stars to reflect the star formation history .",
    "the first dwarfs to fall in would have had the least time for enrichment and have the lowest [ fe / h ] .",
    "this predicts that [ @xmath277/fe ] should also correlate with the amplitude of deviation @xmath260 , to the extent to which we expect the objects with the briefest enrichment time to have the highest [ @xmath277/fe ] .",
    "the gas removal hypotheses provide a potential explanation for the correlation of btfr residuals with luminosity and metallicity .",
    "however , they provide no obvious explanation for the correlation with ellipticity and tidal susceptibility .",
    "this occurs more naturally in the following two scenarios . the removal of gas and the concomitant truncation of star formation and its consequences for metal enrichment may also occur as a result of tidal stripping in the following hypotheses .",
    "the correlation of the residuals with ellipticity in addition to luminosity suggests a role for tidal effects . in this hypothesis ,",
    "the dwarfs become progressively more distorted due to tidal disruption as they orbit the milky way .",
    "stars are lost in the process , reducing the luminosity of the dwarfs . at the present time , the computed tidal radii of the dwarfs greatly exceed their luminous extent .",
    "this leads us to infer that the orbits of the dwarfs must be highly eccentric in this scenario , with most of the stripping occurring during pericenter passage .",
    "this hypothesis predicts that the mass required to reconcile each dwarf with the btfr may exist in a tidal stream .",
    "it further predicts that the age and metallicities of stars in the predicted streams should be consistent with those of the parent body .",
    "examples exist where this may already be observed .",
    "low surface brightness dwarf spheroidals provide a strong test of an alternative to dark matter , mond .",
    "they should very nearly follow the btfr , which is a consequence of the specific form of the modified force law in mond . while some dwarfs do indeed adhere to the btfr ,",
    "others deviate substantially .",
    "the ultrafaint dwarfs of the milky way have mondian mass - to - light ratios in the tens to hundreds .",
    "this is fatal for mond _ if _ these dwarfs are in a stable equilibrium , the spherical approximation used in the analysis is adequate , and the kinematic data are to be trusted .",
    "intriguingly , the sizes of the dwarfs relative to their mondian tidal radii correlate strongly with the degree of deviation from the btfr .",
    "indeed , the discrepancy for mond sets in precisely where the theory predicts that non - equilibrium effects become strong .",
    "it therefore appears that the unacceptably high mass - to - light ratios may be a result of the dwarfs being out of equilibrium .",
    "this should be testable , in the sense that the deviant dwarfs should show evidence of tidal disruption while the dwarfs that adhere to the btfr should not .",
    "notably , stripping of the deviant dwarfs should be ongoing and not restricted to pericenter passage as in the stellar stripping hypothesis .",
    "it is of course possible that some combination of these effects is at work .",
    "as a dwarf satellite approaches its host on its orbit , it is subject to both tidal forces and ram pressure effects .",
    "perhaps gas is lost first due one or both of these effects , with stars being tidally liberated later .",
    "this makes it somewhat difficult to distinguish between the various hypotheses , but it should be possible .    the work of s.s.m .  is supported in part by nsf grant ast 0908370 .",
