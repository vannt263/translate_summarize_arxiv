    "the nearest supermassive black hole candidate lies at the center of the milky way galaxy , weighing in at @xmath1 , as inferred from motions of stars near the galactic center ( ghez et al .",
    "1998 ; genzel et al .",
    "the low luminosity of the point source associated with the center , @xmath2 erg / s , is a conundrum since accretion from stellar winds of neighboring stars should create a luminosity of @xmath3erg / s .",
    "one possibility is that most of the energy is carried by the accreting matter into the black hole , as in the advection - dominated accretion flow solution ( adaf , narayan & yi 1994 ; narayan , yi , & mahadevan 1995 ) .",
    "such a situation is achieved when most of the dissipated energy is channeled into protons which can not radiate efficiently .",
    "low efficiency also occurs when gas accretes spherically and carries its energy in as kinetic energy ( melia 1992 ) .",
    "alternatively , the accretion rate may be overestimated , and the emission may be due to a tenuous disk or jet ( falcke , mannheim , & biermann 1993 ) .",
    "the radio spectrum of sgr a * can be described by a power law , @xmath4 from centimeter to millimeter wavelengths .",
    "this is intriguingly close to the spectrum of optically thin , mono - energetic electrons emitting synchrotron radiation ( beckert & duschl 1997 ) .",
    "however , this explanation is not unique : a self - absorbed source which varies in size as a function of frequency may produce a similar spectral slope ( melia 1992 ; narayan et al .",
    "a possible technique to distinguish these models is to measure the polarization of the emission : faraday rotation and self - absorption can change the polarization magnitude and wavelength dependence ( jones & odell 1977 ) .    only recently has linear polarization been detected at high frequency by aitken et al .",
    "( 2000 : a00 ) ; previous searches at lower frequency showed only upper limits ( bower et al .",
    "1999a , b ) . after correcting for contamination by dust and free - free emission ,",
    "the inferred polarization is 10 - 20% , implying a synchrotron origin .",
    "this correction is made somewhat uncertain by the large beam size .",
    "remarkably , the polarization shows a change in position angle of @xmath5 around 1 mm , which a00 suggest might be due to synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "we first discuss the physics of synchrotron polarization (  2 ) ; we then apply it to various models in the literature (  3 ) ; next we discuss a model consistent with all of the observations (  4 ) ; and finally speculate on the physical implications of this model (  5 ) .",
    "in the synchrotron limit ( @xmath6 ) for an isotropic electron velocity distribution , some analytic results have been derived , which we now summarize ( ginzburg & syrovatskii 1965 & 1969 : gs ) . for a uniform slab of electrons with a power - law distribution , @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 such that electrons with @xmath9 and @xmath10 do not contribute to the frequency of interest )",
    ", we can relate the magnetic field strength and electron density in the slab to the fluid - frame brightness temperature and the spectral turnover due to self - absorption . for @xmath11 and a uniform field @xmath12 (",
    "projected into the sky plane ) we find @xmath13 g and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the brightness temperature in units of @xmath16 k at the self - absorption frequency @xmath17 hz and @xmath18 is the compton scattering optical depth of the emission region . for @xmath19 ,",
    "the emission is self - absorbed so @xmath20 , while above this frequency the emission is optically - thin and @xmath21 where @xmath22 .    in the optically - thin regime ,",
    "the polarization plane is perpendicular to the magnetic field with polarization @xmath23 , up to 100% for @xmath24 . in the optically - thick regime , @xmath25 ( for @xmath26 )",
    "; the radiation polarized perpendicular to the magnetic field is absorbed more strongly than the opposite polarization , causing the radiation polarized along the magnetic field to dominate , switching the polarization angle by @xmath27 , which changes the sign of @xmath28 .",
    "numerical calculations show that the optically - thick polarization peaks at @xmath29% for @xmath30 , but remains large for @xmath31 .",
    "to compute the polarization near the self - absorption frequency requires a knowledge of the polarized opacity and emissivity , @xmath32 . for @xmath11 ,",
    "these can be approximated as ( gs ) : @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the size of the emission region , @xmath36 is the frequency for which the total source has an optical depth of unity ( i.e. @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 is the source function near the frequency @xmath36 , and the @xmath39 or @xmath40 signs go with the radiation emitted @xmath41 or @xmath42 to the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "gs then express the polarization and emission for a slab with uniform magnetic field strength and direction , constant density , and size @xmath35 : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the intensities ( erg/@xmath47/s / hz / sr ) with polarization perpendicular and parallel to the projected direction of the magnetic field on the sky .    for electron distributions which are highly peaked at a single energy ( such as mono - energetic or relativistic maxwellian )",
    "the polarization for @xmath48 is zero .",
    "the faraday effect rotates the polarization vector of photons emerging from different optical depths by different amounts , causing a cancellation in polarization ( agol & blaes 1996 ) .",
    "the differential faraday rotation angle within the source scales as @xmath49 ( jones & odell 1977 ) , where @xmath50 is the compton optical depth of the photosphere .",
    "when optically thin , @xmath51 is constant , so rotation is largest at the self - absorbed wavelength .",
    "when self - absorbed , @xmath50 of the photosphere scales as @xmath52 , so the differential faraday rotation angle @xmath53 ( for @xmath26 ) , again largest at the self - absorption wavelength .",
    "the differential rotation at @xmath36 is @xmath54 , where @xmath9 is the minimum electron doppler factor , @xmath55 is a dimensionless factor of order unity , and @xmath56 is the brightness temperature in units of @xmath57 .",
    "the observations of polarization in sgr a * provide the following constraints on emission models :    \\1 ) the differential faraday rotation angle near the self - absorbed wavelength must be @xmath58 .",
    "\\2 ) the electron distribution must be non - thermal since the polarization due to a thermal electron distribution is suppressed when self - absorbed by a factor of @xmath59 .",
    "if the beam correction by a00 is correct , then @xmath60 12% at self - absorbed wavelengths , requiring @xmath61 .",
    "\\3 ) the self - absorption frequency must lie near the change in polarization angle , @xmath62 mm .",
    "\\4 ) the component contributing at lower frequencies must have zero linear polarization .",
    "\\5 ) the magnetic field must be ordered to prevent cancellation of polarization .",
    "these constraints rule out several models proposed in the literature , as will be discussed in turn .",
    "the low efficiency of an adaf implies a higher accretion rate and thus higher density than for a high efficiency flow of the same luminosity and geometrical thickness . for sgr a *",
    ", an accretion rate of @xmath63yr is inferred due to capture of gas in the vicinity of the black hole ( quataert , narayan , & reid 1999 ; coker & melia 1999 ) , which is the value assumed in adaf models .",
    "assuming that the gas falls in at near the free - fall speed , one infers an electron density @xmath64 @xmath65 and a magnetic field strength of @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the radius of the emission region in units of @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the accretion rate in units of @xmath70/yr , and @xmath71 is the ratio of the alfvn speed to the free - fall speed .",
    "these values imply a total faraday rotation angle at the self - absorption frequency @xmath36 of @xmath72 .",
    "this value is so large that rotation of the emitted radiation leads to zero net polarization , so adafs are in direct conflict with the observed polarization",
    ". only significant modifications of the model , such as a reduction in the accretion rate by a factor of @xmath73 , can reduce the faraday rotation angle @xmath58 .",
    "an accretion rate of @xmath74yr is consistent with the observed luminosity if the accretion flow has a higher efficiency @xmath752% , no longer `` advection - dominated . ''",
    "in addition , adaf models assume a maxwellian electron distribution , which can not produce the observed switch in polarization angle .",
    "finally , adafs predict a higher self - absorption frequency : zel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find that @xmath76 , which implies @xmath77/yr to be consistent with the observed @xmath78hz .",
    "the accretion rate might be reduced if there is significant gas lost by a wind or jet ( begelman & blandford 1999 ; quataert & narayan 1999 ) or if the bondi rate is reduced by heating the infalling gas with heat carried outwards by a convection - dominated accretion flow , or `` cdaf '' ( igumenshchev & abramowicz 1999 , 2000 ; stone , pringle , & begelman 1999 ; quataert & gruzinov 2000 ; narayan , igumenshchev , & abramowicz 2000 ; igumenshchev , abramowicz , & narayan 2000 ) .    the model of melia ( 1992 ) is rather similar to the adaf model , and thus suffers the same problems : the high accretion rate implies high density which is inconsistent with the observed polarization .",
    "beckert & duschl ( 1997 ) considered several 1-zone , quasi - monoenergetic and thermal emission models for the synchrotron emission .",
    "these electron distributions do not produce a swing in polarization angle by 90 degrees since the polarization is suppressed when self - absorbed .",
    "their model does produce a self - absorption frequency near the correct frequency , however .",
    "falcke , mannheim , & biermann ( 1993 ) present a disk - plus - jet model which assumes a tangled magnetic field topology which would erase any polarization .",
    "however , an ordered magnetic field would be a small change to their model which might bring it into line with the polarization observations .",
    "now , we attempt to construct a model consistent with all of the data , using uniform emission regions for simplicity . typical optically - thin agn spectra show @xmath79 ; since @xmath11 is consistent with the polarization from a00 , we fix @xmath11 in our model fits . the model parameters for the polarized component are @xmath80 jy , @xmath81 ghz ( corresponding to @xmath82 mm ) , and @xmath83ghz ( figure 1 ) .    to explain the lack of polarization and spectral slope flatter than 5/2 , we require an additional component which is unpolarized and has a cutoff near 1 mm so that it does nt dilute the polarization at shorter wavelengths . since sgr a * has a spectral slope of 1/3 at mm wavelengths and appears to have a spectral turnover at 1 ghz , we model the spectrum as a monoenergetic electron distribution with energy @xmath84 and zero polarization ( due to faraday depolarization or tangled magnetic field ) which becomes self - absorbed at low frequency ( beckert & duschl 1997 ) . for the unpolarized component , we find @xmath85 with @xmath86ghz , and @xmath87ghz ( figure 1 ) .    fig .  1 : polarization and spectral energy distribution of sgr a * compared to model .",
    "the dashed line shows the polarized component , the dotted line the unpolarized , mono - energetic component , and the solid line the sum of the two .",
    "the dot - dash line shows the maximum cdaf model ( assumed to be unpolarized ; the total polarization is similar if the cdaf replaces the monoenergetic component ) .",
    "the diamonds are the data compiled by narayan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , while the asterisks are the data from bower et al .",
    "( 1999a , b ) and a00 .",
    "figure 1 compares the model to the data . to compare the polarization , we have plotted the stokes parameter that lies at @xmath88 .",
    "remarkably , the polarization should rise to @xmath89% at even shorter wavelengths .",
    "krichbaum et al .",
    "( 1998 ) report a source radius of @xmath90as at 1.4 mm from vlbi observations ; this corresponds to 19@xmath91 .",
    "the source size may be smaller at higher frequencies , but we expect the radius of the emission region to be greater than the size of the event horizon of the black hole , which has an apparent size of @xmath92as projected on the sky ( including gravitational bending , bardeen 1973 ) , so we use an intermediate size in further estimates .",
    "the flux of the fitted model at the self - absorption frequency , @xmath93 ghz , is @xmath94 jy .",
    "this implies a brightness temperature in the emission frame @xmath95 k , where @xmath35 is the size of the source ( we have assumed the area of the source is @xmath96 ) and @xmath97 is the bulk doppler boost parameter . for a steeply falling electron number distribution , @xmath98 ( for @xmath11 ) , where @xmath99 is the energy of the emitting electrons , implying @xmath100 for the electrons at the self - absorption frequency . using the formulae from  2",
    ", we find : @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , implying @xmath104@xmath105 .",
    "the ratio of magnetic to rest - mass energy density is @xmath106 for an electron - proton plasma , indicating a relativistic alfvn speed .",
    "the faraday rotation angle at @xmath107 hz is @xmath108 , assuming @xmath109 . for @xmath110",
    ", @xmath9 can be as large as 4 , reducing @xmath111 to 5 ; for @xmath112 , @xmath9 can be as large as 20 reducing @xmath111 to @xmath113 .",
    "alternatively , if the synchrotron emission is due to a pair plasma , faraday rotation will be reduced by the ratio of the proton number density to the pair number density .",
    "the rotation angle is further reduced at the observed wavelengths by a factor @xmath114 . the high energy cutoff for",
    "the electron distribution may be due to synchrotron cooling since @xmath115 sec , similar to the dynamical time , @xmath116 sec . given the strong scaling of quantities with the unknown @xmath35 and @xmath97 , the above estimates can only be improved with future observations .",
    "the unpolarized emission component dominates at @xmath117 mm , where lo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) measure a source size of @xmath118 cm .",
    "the self - absorption frequency then requires @xmath119 , @xmath120 g , and @xmath121 @xmath105 .",
    "though somewhat ad - hoc , this model reproduces the spectrum well .",
    "the faraday rotation parameter is rather small , so depolarization requires field which is tangled on a scale @xmath89 times smaller than the size of the emission region .",
    "we have tried modeling the spectrum of the unpolarized component with a self - similar , self - absorbed accretion flow .",
    "we used the cyclo - synchrotron emission formulae from mahadevan , narayan , & yi ( 1996 ) and we performed the radiation transfer in full general relativity ( kurpiewski & jaroszyski 1997 ) .",
    "we can place an upper limit on the accretion rate of an adaf component ( using the model of zel et al .",
    "2000 ) since its unpolarized flux must not dilute the polarized component : we find @xmath122yr .",
    "if the adaf surrounds the polarized emission region , then it will depolarize , so the faraday depolarization places a stronger upper limit (  2 ) .",
    "we can place a similar limit on the cdaf model ( using the structure from quataert & gruzinov , 2000 , with equipartition @xmath123 field and @xmath124 ) : we find @xmath125yr ; this accretion rate can account for the unpolarized component at @xmath126ghz ( see figure 1 ) and is consistent with the faraday rotation constraint .",
    "the cdaf luminosity is @xmath127erg / s and the self - absorption frequency is @xmath128ghz , so the polarized component would be visible through it .",
    "finally , we can place a limit on a standard thin disk from the infrared upper limits : we find @xmath129yr ; this upper limit can be increased to a maximum of @xmath130yr if the inner edge of the disk is truncated at @xmath131 .",
    "the main success of advection - dominated accretion models for sgr a * is in explaining the high - frequency radio spectrum and skirting below the upper limits at infrared frequencies .",
    "however , the adaf model is unpolarized at the same high frequencies , inconsistent with the recent detection of linear polarization .",
    "we have constructed a simple toy model for the millimeter polarization which predicts a rise towards shorter wavelengths : polarization of @xmath132 might be seen with scuba at 350 @xmath133 if this model is correct . the lack of polarization and spectral slope of 1/3 at wavelengths longer than 2 mm indicates that a different physical component may be contributing .",
    "the presence of two physical components can be confirmed by looking for a change in variability amplitude and time - scale or source size and morphology around 2 mm .",
    "the high observed polarization implies a highly ordered magnetic field lying near the sky plane .",
    "this might be due to the poloidal field in a jet ( falcke , mannheim , & biermann 1993 ) , or due to a toroidal field in a disk component seen edge - on .",
    "the non - thermal electron distribution might be produced by shock acceleration , reconnection , or electric field acceleration near the event horizon of a spinning black hole ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "the blandford - znajek mechanism can generate a maximum luminosity of @xmath134 erg / s ( thorne , price , & macdonald 1986 ) , so the entire polarized luminosity of sgr a * might be powered by black hole spin .",
    "the dynamics of the emission region will be controlled by the ratio of the magnetic field energy density to the matter energy density , @xmath135 ; however , this ratio scales as @xmath136 , while @xmath97 and @xmath35 are unknown .",
    "doppler boosting decreases the brightness temperature , which reduces faraday rotation but makes the electrons trans - relativistic .",
    "future sub - mm vlbi observations should accurately measure the @xmath35 as a function of frequency , and proper motions may constrain @xmath97 .",
    "also uncertain are the pair fraction and minimum electron energy @xmath9 .",
    "the pair number density can be constrained by measuring the circular polarization ; without pairs , the circular polarization may be as high as a few percent at optically - thin wavelengths ( jones & odell 1977 ) , while pure pair emission should have no circular polarization .",
    "the pair annihilation line should be looked for at higher spatial resolution ; however , it will be strongly broadened by relativistic motions of the pairs .",
    "once the source size is known , @xmath9 and the pair fraction will be constrained by the faraday rotation limit .",
    "an adaf model must have a low accretion rate , @xmath137yr , to be consistent with the lack of faraday rotation of the polarized emission .",
    "such a low inferred accretion rate disagrees with estimates of the bondi accretion rate inferred from stellar winds near the region of the black hole .",
    "if accretion is episodic due to outer - disk instabilities , then the current state might be one of low accretion rate in the inner disk .",
    "alternatively , the accretion rate might be reduced by depositing energy from the accretion flow in the surrounding gas ( either through outflow or convection ) , thus increasing the sound speed and decreasing the capture rate of gas by the black hole .",
    "the accretion flow must deposit energy @xmath138 erg / s , where @xmath139 is the stellar mass loss rate which crosses the bondi radius @xmath140 ( quataert et al .",
    "1999 ) . this can be supplied by accretion which releases energy @xmath141 erg / s , where @xmath142 is the efficiency with which accretion deposits energy at large radius .",
    "as remarked above , a convection - dominated accretion flow with @xmath143yr can explain part of the unpolarized component without diluting the polarized emission ; the associated convection can carry the required energy outward to suppress the bondi accretion rate .    since the self - absorption frequency occurs at @xmath144 , it will be possible to image shadow of a black hole from the ground using vlbi , providing a direct confirmation of the existence of an event horizon ( falcke , melia , & agol 2000 ) .",
    "future sub - mm polarimetric vlbi observations might show rotation of the polarization angle near the black hole , a general relativistic effect which becomes stronger for a spinning black hole ( connors , stark , & piran 1980 ) ."
