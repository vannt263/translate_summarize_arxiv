    "organic field - effect transistors ( ofets ) are the elementary building blocks of `` plastic electronics''.@xcite in these devices , charges are induced in a thin conducting channel at the interface between an organic semiconductor and a gate insulator .",
    "while commercial applications have already appeared , mostly based on low - cost organic thin - films , the fundamental physical mechanisms governing the charge dynamics in these devices are not fully understood .",
    "as it has become clear in recent years , even when high purity crystalline semiconductors are used in order to minimize the effects of structural and chemical disorder , the electronic characteristics of ofets are strongly affected by interactions taking place both within the semiconducting material as well as with its close environment .",
    "this can be traced back to the extremely narrow electronic bands resulting from the weak van der waals intermolecular bonding , that make organic semiconductors much more sensitive to electronic interactions than their inorganic counterparts .",
    "for this reason , polaronic effects have been shown to play an important role in these devices .",
    "several electron - lattice interaction mechanisms relevant to organic molecular crystals have been identified and studied in the past .",
    "these include holstein - like couplings to intra - molecular vibrations , leading to a local reorganization of the molecular energy levels@xcite as well as su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) or peierls - like couplings where the transfer integrals between the molecules are modulated by the inter - molecular motion.@xcite the latter mechanism couples directly the electronic motion to the strong lattice fluctuations arising from the mechanical softness of these compounds , and has been recently identified as the dominant limiting factor of the charge mobility in pure crystalline semiconductors .",
    "@xcite    in addition to such intrinsic mechanisms , interface - related effects have also been demonstrated in several systematic studies of organic fets using different gate dielectrics .",
    "sources of charge trapping have been identified , either related to the interface quality@xcite or to the long - range forces arising from polar impurities at the organic / dielectric interface .",
    "@xcite furthermore , it has been shown that the long - range polarization induced in high-@xmath0 gate materials by the charge carriers themselves can lead to self - trapping of the carriers .",
    "even when sufficient care is taken in order to minimize extrinsic sources of disorder , frhlich polarons are formed due to the polar long - range interaction of the carriers in the organic semiconductor with the phonons at the semiconductor / dielectric interface .",
    "the strength of this remote electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interaction can be tuned by an appropriate choice of the gate dielectric .",
    "the `` metallic - like '' carrier mobility characteristic of crystalline organic semiconductors can be converted into a much lower , thermally activated mobility.@xcite    while there is a vast theoretical literature dedicated to the different electron - lattice interaction mechanisms mentioned above , up to now there have been no attempts to study the interplay between bulk and interface e - ph couplings . to fill this gap , in this work",
    "we analyze a model that includes both bulk and interface effects as can be realized in organic fets , and treat them in a common framework .",
    "we focus on the combined effects of the ssh coupling of the electronic transfer integrals to the inter - molecular vibrations and of a frhlich long - range e - ph interaction as induced by the presence of the gate dielectric in a field - effect geometry .",
    "apart from its relevance to organic / dielectric interfaces , from the fundamental viewpoint this model presents an interesting combination of two _ a priori _ competitive mechanisms .",
    "our results show that a rather weak ssh coupling strength as estimated in refs .",
    "[ ] can have an unexpectedly strong effect in stabilizing a polaronic state when a moderate long - range polar coupling is present .",
    "therefore , self - trapped states of small radius can exist at common organic / dielectric interfaces , even in such cases where the carrier - interface phonon interaction alone would not be sufficient to produce polaronic self - localization @xcite .",
    "this provides a microscopic theoretical basis for the experimental results of ref . , where a finite activation energy indicative of self - trapped states was observed using gate materials such as al@xmath1o@xmath2 and ta@xmath1o@xmath3 .",

    "we implement here a method , combining a variational approach and an exact diagonalization technique , which is able to provide an accurate description of the ground state properties at all values of the system parameters .",

    "we obtain a wavefunction that is able to capture the weak and strong coupling limits and interpolates between them in the intermediate regime .    in practice",
    "we use a basis where each vector is a linear superposition , with appropriate phase factors , of the translational copies of a state having a given electron position and lattice configurations ( phonons and electron are translated together , with their relative position being held fixed ) .",

    "we have checked that this assumption allows to obtain convergency for all the values investigated of the model parameters .",
    "the procedure described above could be straightforwardly generalized to include also the interaction with ssh phonons .",
    "unfortunately , it can be shown that it does not capture the correct physical features of the ssh hamiltonian in the absence of lr interaction.@xcite to treat the ssh term we therefore apply a different approach based on an exact diagonalization procedure , where we do not assume as basis set the coherent states of the adiabatic approach . in this approach the phonon variables",
    "are efficiently limited to a new set which is able to describe successfully the ground state properties , as it will be shown below .",
    "the real bottleneck comes from the phonon hilbert space , that is infinite . to circumvent this difficulty , we keep states where the lattice deformations involve only the sites up to 3rd nearest neighbors of the lattice site where electron is located , all the others being undeformed @xmath53 where @xmath46 indicates the electron position .",
    "we apply a truncation procedure considering only the states with at most @xmath54 quanta , i.e. @xmath55 , where @xmath54 is fixed by requiring convergency of the ground state energy .",
    "these states provide a correct physical description of the ground state properties , since the lattice deformations are effectively localized around the site where the electron is located .",
    "furthermore , in analogy with the lr coupling , we use the translational symmetry associated to periodic boundary conditions to reduce the size of the sparse hamiltonian matrix , requiring that the states have a definite momentum .    when both lr and ssh couplings are considered , we adopt a diagonalization technique on a truncated phonon basis that combines the two subspaces introduced separately for the @xmath56 and @xmath57 cases .",

    "( 1 ) induce different types of polaron states : the lr coupling to the electron density favors localized states centered on the lattice sites ( site polaron ) , while the ssh coupling to the electronic transfer integrals tends to localize the polarons on inter - molecular bonds , i.e. with the electronic charge centered between two neighboring molecular sites ( bond polaron ) .",
    "this competition results in the phase diagrams reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] , which constitute the central results of this paper .",
    "the most notable feature is the existence of a reentrant phase where a bond polaron state is stabilized by the interplay between the two microscopic interaction mechanisms .",

    "the locus of the crossover can be determined by analyzing the qualitative changes induced on the phonon wavefunction , as described at the end of this section .",
    "the large to small polaron crossover is only weakly affected by the presence of the ssh interaction .    as @xmath58 increases , the symmetry of the electronic wave function changes continuously from site - centered to bond - centered .",

    "the transition between the two phases is indicated by the green dashed line in fig.[fig : phasediag]a .",
    "contrary to the large / small polaron crossover , that is rather insensitive to the value of @xmath58 , the site to bond - polaron transition is significantly modified by the presence of the lr interaction , which strongly stabilizes the bond polaron state .",

    "the reason is that such long - ranged polar interaction , for which the preferred polaronic state would be site - centered , is not extremely sensitive to the local details of the wavefunction , so that it can still provide a sizable energy stabilization in the case of a dimer structure .",
    "it should be stressed that the arguments presented here are only qualitative . for a quantitative analysis of the large polaron to bond polaron phase boundary",

    "other materials with slightly larger values of the inter - molecular coupling strength , @xmath58 , would rapidly enter the bond - polaron phase , causing the carriers to undergo a self - trapping transition as soon as a moderate interaction with the dielectric environment is present .",
    "although the model investigated in this paper includes some drastic approximations , i.e. the model is one - dimensional and the real lattice structure of the organic fet is not taken into account , we believe that the main conclusions provided here will not be qualitatively modified by the inclusion of more realistic lattice structures and interactions . the detailed study of the transport characteristics in the bond polaron phase identified here remains as an open question for future work .",
    "in this work we studied the interplay between ssh and frhlich e - ph interactions in one - dimension . while the definition of the ssh coupling in one - dimension is unambiguous,@xcite the polar e - ph interaction term depends on the geometry of the interface .",

    "the case that is studied in the paper is a truly one - dimensional interface , derived for a wire of square cross - section and permittivity @xmath102 embedded in a three - dimensional polar dielectric with permittivity @xmath103.@xcite we specialize the results of ref .",

    "the medium with permittivity @xmath102 is taken to be the vacuum . in this geometry",
    "the interaction of electrons with the interface phonons reads @xmath106 with @xmath107 or , in real space , @xmath108    notice that here the phononic modes are purely one dimensional modes , i.e. they are propagating waves only along the wire ( direction @xmath104 ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the one dimensional interaction discussed above with a two dimensional model .",
    "the model that we consider is the generalization of the case studied previously by mori and ando,@xcite that describes the coupling between electrons and two - dimensional interface phonons . in this case",
    "the interaction matrix element in momentum space reads @xmath109 , with the distance @xmath104 between the electrons and the interface acting as a short - distance cutoff . performing the fourier",
    "transform we find the hypergeometric function @xmath110 this scales as @xmath111 for large @xmath112 , and tends to a constant @xmath113 for @xmath114 .",

    "it can be easily checked by retransforming back to k - space that this power - law form gives rise to the correct @xmath118 limit and lies within @xmath119 of the original one for all @xmath120 .",
    "then , in both one and two - dimensional cases , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1d],[eq:2d ] ) give rise to long range interactions , describing qualitatively similar physical situations .",
    "we have chosen to study explicitly the first model in the body of the paper , as in that case the properties of the phononic degrees of freedom can be directly accessed by the solution of a genuinely one dimensional model .",
