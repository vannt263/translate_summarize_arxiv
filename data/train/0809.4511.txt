    "@xcite introduced a new bulk topological invariant , called spin - chern number , which seemed to the contain more information about the edge structure .",
    "later , however , it became clear that the spin - chern number is unstable to deformations of the hamiltonian system and that the only invariants for the spin - hall effect are of z@xmath0 type , rather than integer type @xcite .",
    "despite of the above concentrated efforts , that actually lead to a deep understanding of the topological insulators , there are still a few open problems .",
    "first , it is not completely clear how to describe the topological phases for non - crystaline systems . secondly , it is well known @xcite that the spin edge current is not quantized in the quantum spin - hall systems and it remained an open problem to find an observable that has such a quantized edge current .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for the integer hall effect , a complete , rigorous description of the edge states that goes beyond crystaline systems was achieved only in 2001 by kellendonk , richter and schulz - baldes @xcite .",
    "the present paper was inspired by a later work of these authors @xcite which deals with the quantization of edge currents for half - plane continuous magnetic operators in the presence of weak random potential .",

    "the special topological properties of the bulk energy bands have non - trivial consequences for the surface states spectrum when an edge is cut on a bulk sample .",
    "let us briefly discuss the edge spectrum for a homogeneous edge . in this case we can use the bloch decomposition with respect to the periodicity along the edge and write the edge hamiltonian as a continuous direct sum of bloch hamiltonians @xmath13 . as illustrated in fig .  2 , the spectrum of each @xmath13 consists of upper and lower continuum parts plus two nondegenerate ( excepting @xmath14=0 ) , discrete eigenvalues .",
    "these discrete eigenvalues for different @xmath14 s assemble themselves in two bands , shown in red color in fig",
    "if the rashba term is zero , one band corresponds to the spin up and the other band to the spin down .",
    "thus , while the charge moves in opposite directions for these two bands ( leading to zero charge current ) , the spins move in the same direction and consequently the edge carries a dissipationless spin current .",
    "the edge modes are protected by the time reversal symmetry , which means no gap can open in the edge spectrum , even when the rashba term is turned on . while @xmath8 is no longer conserved for this later case ,",
    "the edge still carries a dissipationless spin current , thought no longer quantized . because of the last fact",
    ", the theory of quantum spin - hall is still missing a topological invariant that could tell how many edge bands one should expect in more complicated models . finding such an invariant is the goal of the present paper .    our analysis will be done on an equivalent system , a triangular lattice with 4 quantum states per site .",

    "we now consider the system with the edge . in the lab samples ,",

    "our construction is based on the splitting induced by the time - reversal operation @xmath46 : @xmath43 .",
    "this splitting is in general not unique , but we introduced several constraints that limit the number of choices .",
    "these constraints are : the special requirement ( ii ) mentioned in section 3 and the fact that the kernel of the operator @xmath50 needs to be rapidly decaying .",
    "this warrants that our assumption stated before the main statement holds true . since the expectation value of the current is taken only over the states inside the bulk insulating gap , we have to consider only the splitting of the states inside this energy window .",
    "let us first restrict our discussion to homogeneous edges , in which case the the system is mapped into itself by the discrete translations and the wavenumber @xmath14 parallel to the edge is a good quantum number .",
    "dropping the index @xmath1 , which is no longer needed , the condition ( ii ) reads : @xmath115 .",
    "thus , the projections @xmath49 are translational invariant , thus they must be given by sums over the @xmath14 fibers .",
    "for example , the `` + '' projection must be of the form : @xmath116 where @xmath117 represent the bloch functions .",
    "the summation goes only over a partial number of band indexes and the integral over @xmath14 could in principle go only over parts of the brillouin zone .",
    "note that the phase of the bloch functions are not relevant here , a good news because the phases are in general difficult to control .",

    "time reversal invariant spin 1/2 systems , the spectrum is at least doubly degenerate .",
    "for the case when the degeneracy is strictly two - fold , or quaternionically simple @xcite , the bands in crystaline systems come in kramers pairs and one can easily form the projectors @xmath121 with the required properties .     such that @xmath122 , but only situation ( a ) leads to projectors @xmath123 decaying exponentially with the separation @xmath119.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] +    let us exemplify .",

    "as already discussed , there is a pair of kramers bands crossing the bulk insulating gap .",
    "[ sigma1]a shows a properly chosen splitting , which gives projectors @xmath121 that are exponentially decaying with the separation @xmath119 . in contradistinction ,",
    "[ sigma1]b shows a bad splitting , which leads to projectors decaying only as @xmath124 . as already discussed , the unique choice shown in fig .",
    "[ sigma1]a leads to an edge index equal to 2 .",
    "we consider now a more complex situation in which we have more bands crossing the bulk insulating gap .",
    "let us consider the situation of fig .",
    "[ sigma2]a .",
    "this is not quaternionically simple and we know that this case is unstable .",
    "the degeneracies at @xmath14=0 are protected by the time reversal symmetry , but the other two degeneracies will be split by small perturbations .",
    "the stable situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ sigma2]b , which is quaternionically simple . in both cases there seems to be more than one possible valid splittings of the states .",
    "however , if we want to define the projectors @xmath121 so that we go continuously ( more precise analytically ) from situation ( a ) to situation ( b ) , the splitting can be done in only one way , by incorporating the bands that hybridize when the degeneracies are split into either @xmath125 or @xmath126 .",
    "thus , the only possibility of splitting the bands , for both ( a ) and ( b ) situations , is the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ sigma2 ] .",
    "of course there is a freedom of choice in choosing the @xmath11 labels . with this unique choice ,",
    "the edge index is zero .",
    "we can continue the argument for more complex situations , but we can already see the general conclusion : the edge index takes only the values 0 or 2 , in line with the z@xmath0 topological classification of time - reversal invariant systems . also , for homogeneous edges , the expectation value of the current of our observable is simply given by the charge current carried by the bands included in the + sector minus the charge current carried by the bands included in the - sector of the @xmath46 splitting .",
    "this current is given by an index which is well defined if the @xmath46 splitting leads to a kernel of @xmath127 that is rapidly decaying with the separation @xmath119 .",
    "so the message of our result is that , whenever such @xmath46 splitting exists and the index is non - trivial , there will be edge states that are topologically protected .",
