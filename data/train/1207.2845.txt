    "the measurement of equivalent width ( ) for spectral absorption lines is essential in a spectral analysis , particularly for determining the atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances of stars . in the study of stellar spectroscopy , it is critical to determine the atmospheric parameters of stars , such as the effective temperature ( ) , surface gravity ( ) , metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) , and micro - turbulence ( @xmath1 ) , because atmospheric parameters are fundamental to understand spectroscopic properties and construct the model atmosphere for an abundance analysis . for the atmospheric parameters ,",
    "however , the most common method is to analyse the abundances that can be obtained from  measurements of neutral and singly ionized lines .",
    "additionally , the chemical abundances are also estimated by measuring the  of atomic lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the  measurement , therefore , is undoubtedly the most important task in spectroscopic studies .",
    "the  of spectral lines have generally been measured by using the splot task in iraf echelle package , which makes it possible to manually estimate the  of each line .",
    "although this method guarantees a high degree of accuracy for  measurement , it requires a disciplined expert in the field of stellar spectroscopy and the result depends on the personal bias . for an abundance analysis , it is necessary to measure the   for many lines for each star , which is a tedious and time - consuming task .",
    "therefore , a uniform and fast method for  measurement is required in stellar abundance studies using a large number of high - resolution spectra .",
    "@xcite presented a new c++ code , called ares ( automatic routine for line equivalent widths in stellar spectra ) , which can automatically and simultaneously measure the  of spectral lines in stellar spectra .",
    "ares provides quick measurement results for , without manual operation , from high - resolution spectra .",
    "however , ares code focuses on the performance of the code , and hence deprives a user of the interactive operation that can be used to control an environment for each line .",
    "further , a fortran code for  measurement , called daospec , was recently presented by @xcite . in order to achieve",
    "more accurate measurement , daospec offers the enhanced interactive mode for detailed manipulative tasks , such as the adjustment of the local continuum and the deblending of nearby lines .",
    "unfortunately , ares and daospec were written in c++ and fortran , respectively .",
    "therefore , the installation of ares and daospec depends on the platform os , and it would be difficult and inconvenient to compile and run these codes coherently , because of the required libraries ( e.g. , cfitsio , gsl , supermongorhl / sm / sm.html ] , iraf ) .    to avoid these practical difficulties ,",
    "we have developed the tool for automatic measurement of equivalent width ( ) wskang / tame/ ] , which is written in idl and uses a graphical user interface ( gui ) .",
    "can be used with any platform os on which idl has been installed , and it contains various features required to adjust the environment of  measurement such as the local continuum and radial velocity of a star .",
    "its semi - automatic mode ( @xmath2 , the interactive mode ) offers more flexible measurement of the  as similar to daospec . and",
    "its fully automatic mode ( @xmath2 , the automatic mode ) can simultaneously measure the  for a large set of lines .",
    "produces a formatted text file containing the  result which can be used directly in the abundance analysis code moog @xcite , in addition to a graphical output file with the fitting results of the local continuum and line profile .    in this work",
    ", we describe the procedure by which  measures the  of spectral lines and examine the results of  obtained by . in sect .",
    "2 , we introduce the user interface and input parameters of . in sect .",
    "3 , we explain the automatic processes used to measure the  with , such as determining the local continuum , searching for blended lines , and fitting the lines with a gaussian / voigt profile . in sect .",
    "4 , we present the comparison of the manual  measurements obtained using iraf and those obtained using  for the high - resolution spectra of the sun , whose atmospheric parameters are well known .",
    "we also discuss the difference between the  estimated by  and the input  for a synthetic spectrum having different spectral resolutions and s / n ratios . in sect . 5 , we summarize the advantages of using  along with its performance results .",
    "the inputs , outputs , and user interface of  are shown in  [ fig : diag ] .",
    "initially ,  requires the spectrum data in text format and the line list file that contains the line information such as the wavelength , element index ( for moog code ; e.g.  26.0  for fe i ) , excitation potentials ( ev ) , and oscillator strength ( log @xmath3 ) .",
    "the other parameters for  measurement are obtained from the formatted text file , which contains parameters such as the spacing of wavelength ( spacing ) , snr for determining local continuum ( snr ) , smoothing factor ( smoother ) , and measurable minimum ew ( minew ) .",
    "the spacing parameter restricts the wavelength window , which is used for determining the local continuum and searching for the lines .",
    "the snr parameter is related with the cut - off ratio when the local continuum level is being determined .",
    "the smoother parameter is applied to the spectrum in order to mitigate the effect of noise while searching for the lines using numerical derivatives . the smoothed spectrum and its derivatives allow the correct lines to be detected in the spectrum even for a low s / n ratio .",
    "is a gui - based program that provides the plots of the local continuum and the fitting result as shown in  [ fig : diag ] .",
    "the gui consists of the parameter panel ( @xmath4 ) , the interactive panel for adjusting the local continuum ( @xmath5 ) , and the plotting panel of the line - fitting results and its residuals ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "presents the automatic result of the  measurement that can be interactively adjusted by user .",
    "essentially , it has been designed to provide a convenient  measurement for a large number of absorption lines in a high - resolution spectrum .",

    "normalize the local spectrum with the local continuum 3 .",

    "fit the target line with the gaussian / voigt profile with deblending , if required 5 .   estimate the , fwhm , and the center wavelength of the target line from fitting .    in this section ,",
    "we describe the main processes of the  program in detail , such as determining the local continuum level , searching for the lines , and fitting the target line with the sample synthetic spectrum , which has a resolving power of r @xmath7 10000 and a s / n ratio of 100 .",
    "we selected the resolving power and the s / n ratio of synthetic spectra as the lower limit of which  works acceptably .",
    "then , we briefly discuss the two types of output files generated by  and demonstrate how  works for actual spectra by using the examples of metal - rich and metal - poor stars",

    "derive a new curve by polynomial fitting with the residual points after the cut - off 4 .",

    ". ] value of the polynomial fitting curve .",
    "factually , we can not completely reproduce the original continuum of the spectra only from the observed data .",
    "it would only be possible to predict the practical local continuum by using s / n ratio of the observed spectrum .",
    "when using the snr parameter @xmath7 100 (  [ fig : cont_fit]b ) , we found that the final local continuum had a good agreement with the original local continuum , which was supposed to be unity , within a deviation of around 0.3% ( @xmath130.003 ) .",
    "the standard deviation of the residual points ( @xmath14 ) after iterations was very close to 0.01 ( @xmath7 s / n ratio of the synthetic spectrum ) . in the other cases , in which the snr parameter @xmath7 200 and 50 (  [ fig : cont_fit]a and [ fig : cont_fit]c ) , the final local continuum appeared to be more curved than that for snr @xmath7 100 . in  [ fig : cont_fit]a ,",
    "the local continuum is determined at 0.5% higher than the original continuum , and moreover , the shape of the continuum is highly tilted around the target line .",
    "this large discrepancy near the boundary region is because a large number of points were excluded by the input parameter condition , snr @xmath7 200 .",
    "in contrast , as shown in  [ fig : cont_fit]c , when a large number of points were included for continuum fitting , their continuum severely descended around the center .",
    "the local continuum problem is one of the main causes of  errors @xcite .",
    "moreover , the errors arising from the local continuum can not be completely quantified or predicted even though they are known to exist .",
    "hence , the best method to determine the local continuum is visually , by experts who are highly disciplined with the stellar spectrum .",
    "however , it would be inefficient and time - consuming to visually examine the local continuum for hundreds of lines only by eyes .",
    "therefore ,  enhances the process used to determine the local continuum by using the interactive mode .",

    "calculate the exact wavelength using the linear interpolation near the transition points    the numerical derivatives become much more noisy than the original spectrum , because of the noise divergence in a numerical calculation .",
    "[ fig : derivs ] shows how the noise in the spectrum diverges in the cases without or with smoothing .",
    "even when the noise is extremely small in the normalized spectrum , it rapidly multiplies in each numerical derivative calculation . in the case of no smoothing (  [ fig : derivs]a ) , much more lines are identified due to the noisy derivatives , which is amplified in each step of calculation . when the spectrum and derivatives were smoothed with 3 or 5 points , @xmath18 (  [ fig : derivs]b and [ fig : derivs]c ) ,  properly detected two of the correct absorption lines even though the two lines were blended with each other .",

    "extremely broad or extremely narrow lines , relative to the others , can be expected to be affected by obscure lines or to not originate from the stellar atmosphere , and therefore , they can be neglected in the  results .",

[ fig : ex1 ] shows the local continuum fitting results for the  line at 5250.22   for two sample stars . for the metal - rich star hd 75732 , the central region of the local continuum appears to sink below about 2% , relative to the side region .",
    "this is , as mentioned above , because of the undersampling of the points that are used to determine the local continuum in this spectral region .",
    "it is difficult to manage this bending local continuum in a crowded region with computational manipulation , because neglecting a very large number of points by a statistical method might produce an unstable fitting result .",
    "the best solution for metal - rich stars such as hd 75732 , is to confirm the fitting results visually and to correct them through manual interaction .",

    "as shown in  [ fig : trend ] , we found that the  difference between the input and measured values converged rapidly to zero when the spectral resolution increased ( especially , r@xmath0 20000 ) and less sensitive to the noise in the spectrum .",
    "similarly , as the amount of the  difference increased , the detection rate also decreased with a decreasing spectral resolution .",
    "the average  difference sharply decreased below -15 m  at low resolution of r @xmath7 5000 , and particularly , in the case of s / n ratio @xmath7 50 , the  difference reduced to -25 m .",

    "the depth of the absorption line becomes more shallow when a spectral resolution decreases , and hence the noise patterns can be confused with a feature of absorption line in numerical line identification .",
