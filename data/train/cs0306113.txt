    "symbolic analysis of _ linear hybrid automata _",
    "( lha)@xcite can generate a symbolic characterization of the reachable state - space of the lha .",
    "when _ static parameters _ ( system variables whose values are decided before run - time and never changed in run - time ) are used in lhas , such symbolic characterizations may shed important feedback information to engineers . for example , we may use such symbolic characterizations to choose proper parameter values to avoid from unsafe system designs .",
    "unfortunately , lha systems are extremely complex and not subject to algorithmic analysis@xcite . thus in real - world applications",
    ", it is very important to use every measure to enhance the efficiency of lha parametric analysis .    in this work ,",
    "we extend bdd - like data - structures@xcite for the representation and manipulation of lha state - spaces .",
    "bdd - like data - structures have the advantage of data - sharing in both representation and manipulation and have shown great success in vlsi verification industry .",
    "one of the major difficulties to use bdd - like data - structures to analyze lhas comes from the unboundedness of the dense variable value ranges and the unboundedness of linear constraints .",
    "to explain one of the major contribution of this work , we need to discuss the following issue first . in the research of bdd - like data - structures , there are two classes of variables : _ system variables _ and _ decision atoms_@xcite .",
    "system variables are those used in the input behavior descriptions .",
    "decision atoms are those labeled on each bdd nodes . for discrete systems , these two classes are the same , that is , decision atoms are exactly those system variables . but for dense - time systems , decision atoms can be different from state varaibles . for example , in cdd@xcite and crd@xcite ,",
    "decision atoms are of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are system variables of type clock .",
    "previous work on bdd - like data - structures are based on the assumption that decision atom domains are of finite sizes .",
    "thus we need new techniques to extend bdd - like data - structures to represent and manipulate state - spaces of lhas .",
    "our innovations include using constraints like @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 are dense variables ) , as the decision atoms and using total dense orderings among these atoms . in this way , we devised hrd ( hybrid - restriction diagram ) and successfully extend bdd - technology to models with unbounded domains of decision atoms .    in total , we defined three total dense - orderings for hrd constriants ( section  [ sec.vorderings ] ) .",
    "we also present algorithms for set - oriented operations ( section  [ sec.set ] ) and symbolic weakest precondition calculation ( section  [ sec.wpc ] ) , procedures for symbolic parametric analysis ( section  [ sec.wpc ] ) , and discuss our implementation of symbolic convex polyhedra representation normalization ( section  [ sec.norm ] ) . especially , in the presentation of our previous work of bdd - like data - structures for timed automata , people usually asked for presentation of our algorithms for weakest precondition construction . in this paper",
    ", we endeavored to make a concise presentation .",
    "we have also developed a techique for fast parametric analysis of lha ( section  [ sec.pspsc ] ) .",
    "the technique prunes state - space exploration based on static parameter space characterization .",
    "the technique gives us very good performance .",
    "desirably , this technique does not sacrifice the precision of parametric analysis .",
    "especially , for one benchmark , the state - space exploration does not converge without this technique ! to our knowledge , nobody else has come up with a similar technique .",
    "finally , we have implemented our ideas in our tool red 5.0 and reported our experiments to see how the three dense - orderings perform and how our implementation performs in comparison with hytech 2.4.5@xcite and trex 1.3@xcite .",
    "many modern model - checkers@xcite for timed automata@xcite are built around symbolic manipulation procedures@xcite of _ zones _ , which means behaviorally equivalent convex state spaces of timed automata .",
    "the most popular data - structure for zones is dbm@xcite , which is a two dimensional matrix recording differences between pairs of clocks and nothing bdd - like .",
    "as far as we know , the first paper that discusses how to use bdd to encode zones is by wang , mok , and emerson in 1993@xcite .",
    "they discussed how to use bdd with decision atoms like @xmath5 to model - check timed automata . here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are timing constants with magnitude @xmath8 .",
    "however , they did not report implementation and experiments . in the last several years",
    ", people have explored in this approach in the hope to duplicate the success of bdd techniques@xcite in hardware verification for the verification of timed automata @xcite .    for parametric analysis ,",
    "annichini et al have extended dbm to pdbm for parametric analysis of timed automata@xcite and implemented a tool called _ trex _ , which also supports verification with lossy channels .",
    "due to the differences in their target systems , it can be difficult to directly compare the performances of trex and our implementation red 5.0 .",
    "for example , trex only allows for clocks while red 5.0 allows for dense variables with rate intervals . to construct time - progress weakest preconditions ( or strongest postcondition in forward analysis ) for systems with dense variable rate intervals , red 5.0 needs to use one @xmath9-variable for each dense variables and significantly increase the number of decision atoms involving @xmath9-variables .",
    "according to the new formulation of time - prorgress weakest precondition algorithm in @xcite , for systems with only clocks , no literals involving @xmath9-variables ever need to be generated .",
    "thus the complexity for the algorithm used in red 5.0 is relatively higher than those used in trex . on the other hand",
    ", trex may have tuned its performance for the verification of lossy channel systems .    for lhas , people also used convex subspaces , called _ convex polyhedra _ , as basic unit for symbolic manipulation .",
    "a convex polyhedron characterizes a state - space of an lha and can be symbolically represented by a set of constraints like @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "two commonly used representations for convex polyhedra in hytech are ( 1 ) polyhedras and ( 2 ) frames in dense state - space@xcite .",
    "these two representations neither are bdd - like nor can represent concave state - spaces .",
    "data - sharing among convex polyhedra is difficult .",
    "a _ linear hybrid automata ( lha)_@xcite is a finite - state automaton equipped with a finite set of dense variables which can hold real - values . at any moment , the lha can stay in only one _ mode _ ( or _ control location _ ) . in its operation , one of the transitions can be triggered when the corresponding triggering condition is satisfied . upon being triggered ,",
    "the lha instantaneously transits from one mode to another and sets some dense variables to values in certain ranges . in between transitions ,",
    "all dense variables increase their readings at rates determined by the current mode .    for convenience ,",
    "given a set @xmath11 of modes and a set @xmath12 of dense variables , we use @xmath13 as the set of all boolean combinations of atoms of the forms @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 are integers constants , @xmath18 , `` @xmath19 '' is one of @xmath20 , and @xmath6 is a rational constant .",

    "if two lh - expressions are identical after the necessary toggling , then we compare the signs of their first nonzero coefficients to decide the precedence between the two .    with the requirement mentioned in the last paragraph , from now on , we shall only focus on the orderings among lh - expressions whose first nonzero coefficients are negative .    secondly , according to past experience reported in the literature , it is important to place strongly correlated lh - expressions close together in the evaluation orderings .",
    "usually , instead of a single global lha , we are given a set of communicating lhas , each representing a process .",
    "thus it is desirable to place lh - expressions for the same process close to each other in the orderings .",
    "our second important criterion respects this experience . given a system with @xmath136 processes with respective local dense variables , we shall partition the lh - expressions into @xmath137 groups : @xmath138 .",
    "@xmath139 contains all lh - expressions without local variables ( i.e. , coefficients for local variables are all zero ) . for each @xmath140",
    ", @xmath141 contains all lh - expressions with a nonzero coefficient for a local variable of process @xmath142 and only zero coefficients for local variables of processes @xmath143 .",
    "then our second criterion requires that for all @xmath144 , lh - expressions in @xmath141 precede those in @xmath145 .",
    "if the precedence between two lh - expressions can not be determined with the two above - mentioned criteria , then the following third criterion comes to play .",
    "this one is a challenge since for each of @xmath146 can be of infinite size .",
    "traditionally , bdd - like data - structures have been used with finite decision atom domains .",
    "but now we need to find a way to determine the precedence among infinite number of lh - expressions ( our decision atoms in hrd ) . for this purpose",
    ", we invent to use dense - orderings among lh - expressions .",
    "we shall present three such orderings in the following .",
    "sometimes it is difficult to predict which orderings are better suitable for what kind of verification tasks . in section  [ sec.experiments ] , we shall report experiments with these orderings .",

    "the corresponding hrd in dictionary ordering is in figure  [ fig.onehrd](c ) .",
    "one interesting feature of this ordering is that it has the potential to be extended to nonlinear hybrid constraints .",
    "for example , we may say @xmath150 in dictionary ordering since @xmath6 precedes @xmath1 in ascii .",
    "+ * coefficient ordering : * assume that the ordering of the dense variables is fixed as @xmath151 . in this ordering ,",
    "the precedence between two lh - expressions is determined by iteratively comparing the coefficients of dense variables @xmath147 in sequence . for the lh - expressions in figure  [ fig.onehrd ] , we then have @xmath152 the hrd in this ordering is in figure  [ fig.onehrd](a ) . + * magnitude ordering : * this ordering is similar to the last one . instead of comparing coefficients",

    "the first , @xmath218 , computes the weakest precondition from state - space represented by hrd @xmath182 through discrete transition @xmath66 .",
    "assume that the dense variables that get assigned in @xmath41 are @xmath219 and there is no variable that gets assigned twice in @xmath41 .",
    "the characterization of @xmath218 is    @xmath220\\equiv d\\leq y\\leq d'$ ] .",
    "@xmath221\\equiv d < y\\leq d'$ ] .",
    "@xmath222 . @xmath223 . ]",
    "assume that @xmath224 is the same as @xmath182 except that all dense variables @xmath1 are replaced by @xmath225 respectively .",
    "here @xmath226 represents the value - change of variable @xmath1 in time - passage . for example",
    ", @xmath227 . intuitively , when @xmath1 represents the value of variable @xmath1 in the weakest precondition of time passage , then @xmath225 is the value of @xmath1 in the postcondition of the time - passage .",
    "the second basic procedure , @xmath228 , computes the weakest precondition from @xmath182 through time passage in mode @xmath14 .",
    "it is characterized as    @xmath229    one basic building block of both @xmath230 and @xmath231 is for the evaluation of @xmath232 .",
    "we implement this basic operation with the following symbolic procedure .",
    "@xmath233 .",
    "procedure @xmath234 eliminates all constraints in @xmath182 involving variables in set @xmath235 .",
    "procedure @xmath236 adds to a path every constraint that can be transitively deduced from two peer constraints involving @xmath1 in the same path in @xmath182 .",
    "the algorithm of @xmath237 is in table  [ tab.xtivity ] .    ' '' ''    @xmath238 , @xmath239 ; + @xmath240 \\ { @xmath241 ; return @xmath242 ; } + @xmath242 \\ {   + if @xmath182 is @xmath49 or @xmath132 , return @xmath182 ; else if @xmath243 , return @xmath244 ;   + else / * assume @xmath245 * / \\ {   + @xmath246 ;   + @xmath247 ; return @xmath244 ;   + } + } + @xmath248 \\ {   + if @xmath182 is @xmath49 or @xmath132 , return @xmath182 ; else if @xmath249 , return @xmath244 ; ( 3 )   + else / * assume @xmath250 * / \\ {   + if @xmath251 ,   + @xmath252 ;   + else @xmath253 ;   + @xmath254 ; return @xmath244 ; ( 4 )   + } + }    ' '' ''    @xmath255 is a shorthand for the new upperbound obtained from the xtivity of @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "thus we preserve all constraints transitively deducible from a dense variable before it is eliminated from a predicate .",
    "this guarantees that no information will be unintentionally lost after the variable elimination .",
    "note that in our algorithm , we do not enumerate all paths in hrd to carry out this least fixpoint evaluation .",
    "instead , in statement ( 3 ) , our algorithm follows the traditional bdd programming style which takes advantage of the data - sharing capability of bdd - like data - structures .",
    "thus our algorithm does not explode due to the combinatorial complexity of path counts in hrd .",
    "this can be justified by the performance of our implementation reported in section  [ sec.experiments ] .",
    "assume that the unsafe state is in mode @xmath258 .",
    "with the two basic procedures , then the backward reachable state - space from the risk state @xmath259 ( represented as an hrd ) can be characterized by    @xmath260    here @xmath261 is the least fixpoint of function @xmath262 and is very commonly used in the reachable state - space representation of discrete and dense - time systems . after the fixpoint is successfully constructed ,",
    "we conjunct it with the initial condition and then eliminate all variables except those static parameters ( formally speaking , projecting the reachable state - space representations to the dimensions of the static parameters ) .",
    "suppose the set of static dense parameters is @xmath89 .",
    "the characterization of unsafe parameter valuatons is thus    @xmath263    the set of parametric solutions is characterized by the complement of this final result .",
    "there can be infinitely many lh - constraint sets that represent a given convex polyhedron .",
    "an lh - constraint in such a representation can also be _ redundant _ in that a no less restrictive upperbound can be derived for its lh - expression from peer lh - constraints in the same representation . to control the redundancy caused by recording many lh - constraint sets for the same convex polyhedron , representations of convex polyhedra have to be normalized .",
    "due to page - limit , we shall skip much details in this regard .",
    "we emphasize that much of our implementation effort has been spent in this regard .",
    "we use a two - phase normalization procedure in each iteration of the least fixpoint evaluation .    :",
    "this step eliminates those convex polyhedra contained by a peer convex polyhedron in the hrd for the reachable state - space .",
    "first , we collect the lh - expressions that occur in the current reachable state - space hrd and call them _ proof - obligations_. then we try to derive the tightest constraints for these proof - obligations along each hrd paths of the reachable state - space representation .",
    "then we eliminate those paths which is subsumed by other paths .",
    "the subsumption can be determined by pairwise comparison of all lh - constraints along two paths .",
    ": along each path , we combinatorially use up to four constraints to check for the redundancy of peer constraints in the same path and eliminate them if they are found redundant .",
    "again , our algorithm does not enumerate paths in hrd .",
    "instead , it takes advantage of data - sharing capability of hrd for efficient processing .",
    "we have also experimented with techniques to improve the efficiency of parametric analysis .",
    "one such technique , called _ pspsc _ , is avoiding new state - space exploration if the exploration does not contribute to new parametric solutions .",
    "a constraint is _ static _",
    "iff all its dense variables are static parameters .",
    "static constraints do not change their truth values .",
    "once a static constraint is derived in a convex polyhedron , its truth value will be honored in all weakest preconditions derived from this convex polyhedron .",
    "all states backwardly reachable from a convex polyhedron must also satisfy the static constraints required in the polyhedron .",
    "thus if we know that static parameter valuation @xmath90 is already in the parametric solution space , then we really do not need to explore those states whose parameter valuations fall in @xmath89 .    with pspsc ,",
    "our new parametric analysis procedure is shown in table  [ tab.pspsc ] .    ' '' ''",
    "@xmath264 \\ {   + @xmath265   + while @xmath266 , do \\ {   + @xmath267 ;   + @xmath268 ;   + @xmath269;(5 )   + @xmath270   + }   + return @xmath271 ; + }    ' '' ''    in the procedure , we use varaible @xmath272 to symbolically accumulate the parametric evaluations leading to the risk states in the least fixpoint iterations . in statement",
    "( 5 ) , we check and eliminate in @xmath273 those state descriptions which can not possibly contribute to new parametric evaluations by conjuncting @xmath273 with @xmath271 .",
    "one nice feature of pspsc is that it does not sacrifice the precision of our parametric analysis .",
    "[ lemma.pspsc ] @xmath90 is a _ parametric solution _ to @xmath31 and @xmath47 iff @xmath90 satisfies the return result of @xmath264 .",
    "+ details omitted due to page - limit .",
    "the basic idea is that the intersection at line ( 5 ) in table  [ tab.pspsc ] only stops the further exploration of those states that do not contribute to new parameter - spaces .",
    "those parameter - spaces pruned in line ( 5 ) do not contribute because they are already contained in the known parameter constraints @xmath272 and along each exploration path , the parameter constraints only get restricter .    as mentioned in the proof sketch , pspsc can help in pruning the space of exploration in big chunks .",
    "but in the worst case , pspsc does not guarantee the exploration will terminate . in section  [ sec.experiments ] , we shall report the performance of this technique . especially ,",
    "for one benchmark , the state - space exploration can not converge without pspsc .",
    "we have implemented our ideas in our tool red which has been previously reported in @xcite for the verification of timed automata based on bdd - like data - structures .",
    "red version 5.0 supports full tctl model - checking / simulation with graphical user - interface .",
    "coverage estimation techniques for dense - time state - spaces has also been reported@xcite .",
    "we have also carried out experiments to compare various ideas mentioned in this work .",
    "in addition , we have also compared with hytech 2.4.5@xcite , which is the best known and most popular tool for the verification of lha due to its pioneering importance .",
    "the following three benchmark series are all adapted from hytech benchmark repository .",
    "_ fischer s mutual exclusion algorithm .",
    "_ this is one of the classic benchmarks .",
    "there are two static parameters @xmath31 and @xmath184 , @xmath136 processes , and one local clock for each process .",
    "the first process has a local clock with rate in @xmath44 $ ] while all other processes have local clocks with rates in @xmath274 $ ]",
    ". the algorithm may violate the mutual exclusion property when @xmath275 .",
    "_ general railroad crossing benchmarks .",
    "_ there is a static parameter cutoff , a gate - process , a controller - process , and @xmath136 train - processes .",
    "the local dense variable of the gate - process models the angle of the gate and has rates in @xmath276 $ ] , @xmath277 $ ] , and @xmath278 $ ] depending on which modes the gate - process is in .",
    "the controller process does not use clocks .",
    "each train - process uses a local clock with rate in @xmath279 $ ] .",
    "the system may not lower the gate in time for a crossing train when @xmath280 .",
    "_ nuclear reactor controller .",
    "_ there are @xmath136 rod - processes and one controller process .",
    "each process has a clock with rate in @xmath279 $ ] .",
    "a rod just - moved out of the heavy water must stay out of water for at least @xmath281 ( a static parameter ) time units .",
    "the timing constants used in the benchmarks are @xmath282 , and @xmath283 .",
    "the controller may miss the timing - constraints for the rods if @xmath284 .",
    "_ csma / cd .",
    "_ this is modified from @xcite .",
    "the two timing constants @xmath31 and @xmath184 , set to 26 and 52 respectively , are now treated as static parameters to be analyzed .",
    "we do require that @xmath285 . basically , this is the ethernet bus arbitration protocol with the idea of collision - and - retry .",
    "the biggest timing constant used is 808 .",
    "we want to verify that mutual exclusion after bus - contending period can be violated if @xmath286 .    in our experiment ,",
    "we compare performance in both forward and backward reachability analyses .",
    "the performance data of hytech 2.4.5 and red 5.0 with dictionary ordering ( no pspsc ) , coefficient ordering ( no pspsc ) , magnitude ordering ( pspsc ) , and coefficient ordering with pspsc is reported in table  [ tab.perf.bck ] ( for backward analysis ) and table  [ tab.perf.fwd ] ( for forward analysis ) .",
    ".comparison in backward analysis with hytech w.r.t .",

    "although the data set is still small and incomplete , but we feel that the hrd - technology shows a lot of promise in the table .",
    "we believe this can largely be attributed to the data - sharing capability of bdd - like data - structures .",
    "this work is a first step toward using bdd - technology for the verification of lhas .",
    "although the initial experiment data shows good promise , we feel that there are still many issues worthy of further research to check the pros and cons of hrd - technology .",
    "especially , we have to admit that we have not developed algorithms to eliminate general redundant constraints in hrds .",
    "our present implementation eliminates redundant lh - constraints that can be deduced by four peer lh - constraints along the same paths .",
