    "a decade ago , two types of azimuthal anisotropies have been evidenced in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "following their shape relative to the reaction plane and the main mechanism behind them they have been baptized as in - plane and out - of - plane enhancement or rotational - like @xcite and squeeze - out @xcite phenomena , respectively .",
    "how the transition from one to the other scenario takes place as a function of incident energy , for different collision geometries and types of the reaction products was a question addressed few years later for a light @xcite and heavy system @xcite .",
    "soon , it was realized that a detailed study of such a transition from in - plane to out - of - plane emission as a function of incident energy could give more insight into the relative contribution of the attractive and repulsive forces , the lifetime of the emitting source , its rotational energy and expansion dynamics .",
    "therefore many studies concentrated on this subject @xcite .    below this transition energy , @xmath0 ,",
    "the experimental data show an in - plane enhancement of the azimuthal distribution .",
    "theoretical calculations established that a rotating compound system created by the mean field , dissipating angular momenta and excitation energy via particle emission , stays at the origin of this observation @xcite .    increasing the beam energy the mean field which contributes to the formation of a rotating compound system becomes less important and processes based on nucleon - nucleon interaction start to be predominant .",
    "the hydrodynamic approaches used to predict different phenomena which take place in the relativistic regime of heavy ion collisions have shown that a preferential emission of the `` squeezed '' participant zone in the free phase space , not hindered by the spectator nuclear matter , takes place .",
    "the out - of - plane emission of the nuclear matter has been called squeeze - out @xcite and has been confirmed experimentally by plastic ball @xcite and diogene @xcite collaborations few years later .",
    "afterwards , the generality of this phenomenon was evidenced experimentally .",
    "thus , pions @xcite , kaons @xcite , neutrons @xcite , light particles @xcite , proton - like particles @xcite and intermediate mass fragments @xcite show a similar squeeze - out pattern in the azimuthal distributions",
    ". detailed theoretical investigations of this phenomenon were also undertaken , using microscopic transport models @xcite .",
    "the existence of an azimuthally symmetric flow evidenced in central heavy ion collisions @xcite can be regarded as the extreme case of the out - of - plane flow . in other words ,",
    "the squeeze - out is the result of the expansion of the hot and compressed participant zone in the presence of the projectile and target spectators .",
    "although it is obvious that the cleanest signal on the collective expansion of hot and compressed baryonic matter can be obtained from central collisions , one has to accept that this is an extreme case and the study of a rotating hot and compressed object remains an appealing subject . if the angular momenta and the shadowing realized by the spectator matter which come into the game bring more complications at first glance , they can be used as internal clocks to gain more information on the expansion dynamics .",
    "the incident energy where the effects of these three competing processes , expansion , rotation and shadowing , compensate each other could be looked as a benchmark observable for deeper understanding of the expansion dynamics .",
    "in this paper we present the results of a multidimensional analysis of the transition energy as a function of the mass of emitted particles , their transverse momentum and for different collision centralities .",
    "early fopi studies @xcite , done using the experimental data from phase i of the detector , have been continued with the data obtained using the full phase space coverage of phase ii of this device @xcite .",
    "relative to the phase i fopi studies , the present data make possible the azimuthal distributions studies in a reference frame with the @xmath3 axis along the sidewards flow direction , with no upper limitation on transverse momentum and as function of the mass of light charged particles .    chapter 2 describes in more details the experiment and the experimental data analysis .",
    "the experimental results are presented in chapter 3 .",
    "chapter 4 is dedicated to the comparison of the results with the predictions of a microscopic transport model .",
    "conclusions are presented in chapter 5 .",
    "the present experimental configuration @xcite was used to study au+au , xe+csi and ni+ni collisions at 90 , 120 , 150 , 250 and 400@xmath2a mev , aiming to continue our studies started with phase i of the fopi @xcite detector with much better phase space coverage and as a function of the baryonic number involved in the process .",
    "the beam energies are the mid - target energies , taking into account the upstream energy loss of the beam .",
    "the results presented in this paper refer to the au+au system .    since details of the first phase can be found in our earlier publications , especially in ref .",
    "@xcite , we describe here the main features of the central drift chamber ( cdc ) , the main extension of phase i of the fopi facility @xcite used in this experiment .",
    "the cdc is a drift chamber that performs the tracking of the path followed by all charged reaction products emitted in the polar angular range 33@xmath4150@xmath5 .",
    "the path being curved in the magnetic field of a superconducting solenoid , one can use the transverse momentum and specific energy loss for mass identification of the reaction products .",
    "full azimuthal coverage is realized by this tracking device .",
    "the detector is subdivided in 16 sectors , each containing 60 sense wires and 60 potential wires , all aligned parallel to the beam axis .",
    "the sense wires are resistive and readout on both ends , which gives the possibility to reconstruct the position along the wire of the hit via charge division .",
    "the reconstruction of the initial position of the ionized cell along the ionizing particle path is obtained making use of the electrons drift velocity of about 43.7 @xmath6m / ns and of the lorentz angle @xmath7=32@xmath5 .",
    "as the direction of the drift electrons can not be measured , each hit has a symmetric partner relative to the sense wires plane ( mirror hit ) .",
    "they combine and form mirror tracks . in order to have a criterion to distinguish between real and mirror tracks ,",
    "the sense wires planes are tilted 8@xmath5 relative to the radial direction starting from the beam axis . within this geometry",
    "the mirror tracks do not originate anymore from the target .",
    "furthermore , the sense wires within a plane are alternatively staggered by @xmath8100  @xmath6 m , which could be also used to reject the mirrored tracks .",
    "the individual signal wires of 50  @xmath6 m thick nicr - based alloy with a resistance of 500  @xmath9/m vary between 86 and 190  cm .",
    "the mixture used for the chamber consists of 88% ar , 10% isobuthane and 2% ch@xmath10 at a slight overpressure .",
    "the cdc was operated in a `` split - mode '' in order to increase its dynamical range . while the most outer 30 potential wires were operated at a nominal voltage of -1.55 kv , optimum for a good resolution for energetic light particles ( z=1,2 ) , the most inner 30 potential wires had a lower voltage of -1.1 kv , such that the amplitude of the signals corresponding to highly ionizing fragments ( z=3 - 6 ) to be within the dynamical range of our sampling convertors , flash adcs ( 8 bit , non - linear ) .",
    "the relative momentum resolution @xmath11 varies from 4% for @xmath12  0.5  gev / c to about 12% for @xmath13=2  gev / c . a helium bag placed between the target and the forward subdetector of phase",
    "i @xcite , following the conical shape of the cdc forward endcap , was used in order to decrease the energy thresholds for the intermediate mass fragments flying in the forward direction at @xmath1430@xmath5 .",
    "it is worth to mention here that within the phase space covered by the phase i subdetector the reaction products are identified by their charge using specific energy loss and time - of - flight information , while the fragments detected by the cdc are identified by their mass , as the information on the specific energy loss and magnetic rigidity was available .    the phase space coverage of the whole device used in the present experiment , in a transverse momentum - @xmath15 versus rapidity - @xmath16 representation , can be followed in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] . the borders between different subdetectors at 1.2@xmath5 , 7@xmath5 , 30@xmath5 and 33@xmath5",
    "are represented by thick lines .",
    "the shadowed area between 30@xmath5 and 33@xmath5 corresponds to the region between the plastic wall ( pw ) and cdc which is not covered at all .",
    "the low thresholds ( lt ) are represented by thin continuous lines .",
    "they correspond to the measured values ( dotted lines ) after correction for the energy loss in the media before the active detectors .",
    "this was done assuming that the interaction has taken place in the middle of the target . for polar angles smaller than 30@xmath5",
    "the low threshold corresponds to the momenta for which the particles reach the pw in order to deliver a time signal while the specific energy loss is obtained from a layer of ionization chambers or thin plastic scintillators in front of the pw @xcite . for polar angles larger than 30@xmath5 lt",
    "was considered to correspond to the momenta for which the ionizing particles could reach the outer radius of the cdc .",
    "the dashed lines correspond , for the forward detector , to the momenta at which the plastic scintilators are just penetrated by the corresponding particles . in this case",
    "the energy loss correction is negligible . for the cdc",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the momenta at which the energy loss corrections are below 1% .",
    "the combination of the very high hit densities into tracks associated to the true particles is a serious challenge of a tracking algorithm @xcite .",
    "the data analyzed in the present paper have been obtained using for the cdc a local tracking method - `` track - following '' - in a version developed within the fopi collaboration @xcite .",
    "[ fig-2 ] shows a representation where the performance of the algorithm in track resolution can be followed .",
    "it corresponds to a projection in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis of the trajectories associated to the charged particles seen by the cdc in a typical event from central au+au collisions at 250@xmath2 amev .",
    "the straight lines of dots are representing the anode ( sense ) wires , while the rest of symbols are the registered hits .",
    "grey symbols are belonging to reconstructed tracks and the open squares are their mirrored counterparts .",
    "the dark full squares are the leftovers remained unassigned to any track .",
    "the mass identification performance of cdc using specific energy loss ( @xmath17 ) versus transverse momentum divided by charge ( @xmath18 ) of the detected particles can be followed in fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] .",
    "a cross - check of the present calibration of cdc @xcite was done using comparison with our earlier data measured with si - csi telescopes @xcite .",
    "good agreement between the two sets of data , in spectral shape and yields , was obtained .",
    "however , using only the cdc information , the a=3 branch contains a mixed contribution from @xmath19he and tritium ( t ) fragments ( as can be seen in fig.3 ) .",
    "consequently , the momentum associated to @xmath20he fragments will be underestimated by a factor of two if @xmath21=1 , corresponding to hydrogen isotopes , is considered . based on the phase space distribution of @xmath20he and t obtained in one of our previous experiments @xcite ,",
    "the contribution of @xmath20he to a=3 yield for a given @xmath22 range ( using @xmath21=1 ) is smaller that 15% .",
    "as it can be seen later , this amount of contamination does not influence different systematics of a=3 fragments .",
    "they nicely fall between those corresponding to a=2 and a=4 fragments .",
