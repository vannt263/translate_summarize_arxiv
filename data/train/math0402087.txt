    "to determine the volume of a hyperbolic tetrahedron is one of the fundamental problem of the hyperbolic @xmath0-space . for orthoschemes ,",
    "a closed formula is known at the very beginning of the hyperbolic geometry . however , closed formulas for the volumes of generic hyperbolic tetrahedra are given rather recently by @xcite and is modified to more symmetric form in @xcite .",
    "these formulas are given in terms of dihedral angles of the tetrahedron .",
    "in this paper , we give a closed formula in terms of edge lengths instead of dihedral angles .",
    "the background of this formula is the volume conjecture for hyperbolic @xmath0-manifolds . in @xcite ,",
    "r. kashaev conjectured in a relation between certain quantum invariants of hyperbolic knots and the volumes of the knot complements of them , and checked it numerically for some examples . in @xcite",
    ", h. murakami observed that such relation also holds for some closed hyperbolic @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "these observations suggest that there is a relation between the volume of a hyperbolic @xmath0-manifold and its turaev - viro invariant ( see @xcite ) , which is a state - sum invariant given by quantum @xmath1-symbols associated to the tetrahedra of a simplicial decomposition of the manifold . indeed , applying kashaev s method to investigating the asymptotics of the quantum @xmath1-symbols , we get the formula for the volume of a hyperbolic tetrahedron .",
    "the formula by dihedral angles in @xcite also comes from the @xmath1-symbols in the same way , and it resembles so much the formula given in this paper .",
    "such similarity comes from the relations in @xcite and @xcite , by which the volume function in terms of edge lengths implicitly comes from the volume function in terms of dihedral angles .",
    "we can apply this method to the formula in @xcite .",
    "however , to get the actual volumes , we have to specify the adequate branches of the dilogarithm functions in the formula . here",
    "we give a direct proof of our formula , and show that we can actually compute the volume of any hyperbolic tetrahedron from it .    * acknowledgement .",
    "* we would like to thank professor yana mohanty for informing the relations in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the second author would like to thank the support from the jsps postdoctoral fellowships for research abroad @xmath2 .",
    "for complex numbers @xmath3 , we first define a complex - valued function @xmath4 as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the dilogarithm function defined by the analytic continuation of the following integral : @xmath7    secondly we define two complex values @xmath8 and @xmath9 as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 these @xmath8 and @xmath9 are originally defined in @xcite as two non - trivial solutions of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 means the real part",
    ". we will see it ( and other properties of @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) in section  [ s_proof ] .",
    "finally we define a complex - valued function @xmath14 as follows : @xmath15 then the following theorem has been proved in @xcite :    [ thm_va ] let @xmath16 be a tetrahedron with dihedral angles as shown in figure  [ f_tetra ] , and let @xmath17 be its volume .",
    "then the following equations hold :    1 .   if @xmath18 is hyperbolic , then @xmath19 , 2 .   if @xmath18 is euclidean , then @xmath20 , and 3 .   if @xmath18 is spherical , then @xmath21 ,    where @xmath22 .",
    "we can easily see that both @xmath8 and @xmath9 have the following simpler presentations in this case : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the gram matrix in terms of dihedral angles defined as follows ( precise definition will be seen in section  [ s_gram ] ) : @xmath26 the original proof of theorem  [ thm_va ] was to show the equivalence to cho - kim s formula in @xcite , and now there are several different proofs and formulations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to give a proof of the following theorem :    [ thm_vl ] let @xmath27 be the length of the edge corresponding to a dihedral angle @xmath28 ( see figure  [ f_tetra ] again ) , and we denote by @xmath29 a hyperbolic tetrahedron with edge lengths @xmath27 . then the following equation holds : @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "we here note that , in this case , both @xmath8 and @xmath9 have the following simpler presentations : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the gram matrix in terms of edge lengths defined as follows ( precise definition will be seen in section  [ s_gram ] ) : @xmath35",
    "unlike euclidean one , in hyperbolic geometry the dihedral angles and the lengths of the edges of a simplex is closely related each other . in this section",
    "we review two well - known aspects of the relationship , namely we review how to obtain dihedral angles from edge lengths , and vice verse .",
    "see , for example , @xcite for details .",
    "for any @xmath36 , let @xmath37 be the _ hyperboloid model of an @xmath38-dimensional hyperbolic space_. for a hyperbolic @xmath38-simplex @xmath39 , we denote by @xmath40 the set of vectors of the vertices , and by @xmath41 the length of the edge with end points @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "then the following relation holds : @xmath44    we denote by @xmath45 the outward normal vector to the facet ( i.e. , @xmath46-dimensional face ) opposite to @xmath42 , and by @xmath47 the dihedral angle between two facets with normal vectors @xmath45 and @xmath48 ( i.e. , two facets opposite to @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) .",
    "we also define @xmath49 .",
    "then the following relation holds : @xmath50      let @xmath51 be an @xmath52 real matrix of signature @xmath53 .",
    "this matrix is called the _ gram matrix in terms of dihedral angles _ , and determined independent of the position in @xmath54 via .",
    "if @xmath55 and dihedral angles are named as in figure  [ f_tetra ] , then you can easily check that @xmath25 becomes as in .",
    "let @xmath56 be the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries @xmath57 , and let @xmath58 be the cofactor matrix of @xmath25 , namely @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a submatrix of order @xmath38 obtained from @xmath25 by removing the @xmath61th row and @xmath62th column .",
    "then we have @xmath63 .",
    "so , using and @xmath64 for any @xmath61 , we have @xmath65      the method is just the same as in the previous subsection .",
    "let @xmath66 be an @xmath52 real matrix of signature @xmath53 .",
    "this matrix is called the _ gram matrix in terms of edge lengths _ , and determined independent of the position in @xmath54 via .",
    "if @xmath55 and edge lengths are named as in figure  [ f_tetra ] , then you can easily check that @xmath34 becomes as in .",
    "let @xmath67 be the cofactor matrix of @xmath34 . then",
    ", using and @xmath68 for any @xmath61 in this case , we have the following relationship between @xmath47 and edge lengths : @xmath69    we already know a volume formula theorem  [ thm_va ] in terms of dihedral angles .",
    "so combine it with and we can theoretically obtain a formula in terms of edge lengths .",
    "however the formula in theorem  [ thm_vl ] does not come from this procedure , and its proof given in the next section is also independent of theorem  [ thm_va ] .",
    "we start this section with checking the details of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , most of which are already known in @xcite .      using @xmath73 ,",
    "we have @xmath74 so the following are equivalent : @xmath75 when we choose ",
    "@xmath76 \" part of the above equation , the following equation holds : @xmath77 thus @xmath78 is a solution of @xmath79 , namely @xmath80 .",
    "proposition  [ prop_z ] means that @xmath85 can take discrete values .",
    "but , by the definition , @xmath85 is an analytic function in terms of @xmath86",
    ". so @xmath87 must be zero .",
    "thus we have the following corollary :          here we only show that @xmath92 modulo @xmath91 .",
    "other cases can be shown similarly . using corollary  [ cor_der ] , the following holds for each @xmath93 : @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are defined as follows : @xmath97",
    "thus the following holds : @xmath98",
    "now @xmath99 so we have @xmath100 where we use at the last equality .",
    "thus we have proved proposition  [ prop_dv ] .",
    "let @xmath102 be the right - hand side of the formula .",
    "since @xmath103 is represented by the edge lengths symmetrically , and the edge lengths can be represented by the dihedral angles symmetrically as in , all we need to show are , by the schlfli s differential formula , the following two facts :          since both @xmath103 and @xmath17 are analytic function with variables @xmath106 , the result obtained above means that the difference between @xmath103 and @xmath17 is a constant independent of @xmath106 .",
    "for the proof of the later one , let @xmath107 be a hyperbolic regular tetrahedron with all edge lengths being @xmath108 , and we consider a sequence of such tetrahedra shrinking to a point .",
    "then clearly @xmath109 .",
    "on the other hand , we have the following equations in this case : @xmath110 where the third equation follows from proposition  [ prop_z ] , and the last one from proposition  [ prop_dv ] .",
    "thus the following equation holds :        when @xmath108 converges to @xmath113 , then @xmath8 converges to @xmath114 , a branch point of @xmath115 .",
    "however this convergence is not spiral because @xmath116 for any @xmath117 .",
    "so we have @xmath118 furthermore we have @xmath119 thus we conclude as follows : @xmath120 finally we have @xmath121 and @xmath122 is actually the dihedral angle of the euclidean regular tetrahedron .",
