    "the experimental realization of degenerate atomic gases @xcite have opened up the possibility of engineering strongly correlated many - body quantum states .",
    "such states are fundamental for the development of quantum technologies such as those implementing quantum information protocols and quantum computation .",
    "a paramount example is the realization of a mott insulator ( mi ) @xcite in the lowest bloch band of an optical lattice which can serve as a quantum register @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensates of alkali atoms have also been proposed as systems to realize macroscopic superposition states @xcite or number correlated states ( also called twin fock states ) which are useful for quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we proposed a method for engineering twin fock states via a two - component mi to superfluid ( sf ) transition .",
    "the proposed scheme manipulates hyperfine states of atom pairs pinned to single lattice sites and decoupled from one another in the mi regime @xcite .",
    "the mi limit has already proven to be useful starting point for quantum state engineering since the motional dynamics are frozen out and the system decouples to a set of single site hamiltonians to good approximation . in the case of a two - component system with doubly occupied sites spin - changing collisions will occur and can be accurately controlled with external magnetic or microwave fields @xcite . as a result",
    "the spin - dynamics of atom pairs behaves like an effective two - level system undergoing rabi - like oscillations .",
    "in contrast to the usual rabi - model for the coupling of a pair of _ single - particle _ states this represents a coherent coupling between a pair of _ two - particle states _ induced by collisional interactions .",
    "these local _ two - particle _ correlations are then transformed into _ multi - particle _ correlations extending over the whole system by melting the mi into a sf .",
    "this quantum melting can be experimentally implemented by adiabatically ramping down the depth of the lattice potential .",
    "the build up of long - range correlations when a periodic potential is dynamically lowered is a highly non trivial process that occurs rather quickly in a one - component system @xcite .",
    "the quantum melting of a multi - component system is still an open problem that is even more intriguing due to the different phases that appear in the @xmath0 phase diagram depending on the ratios of the interparticle interactions and of the tunneling rates of each component @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the two - component symmetric case with all interparticle interactions equal can be found in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we studied the adiabatic melting of an optical lattice in a two - component system with different values for the inter - species and intra - species interactions .",
    "we showed that one can create twin fock states with high fidelity via melting of an initial mi state with two atoms per site in different internal states .",
    "we inspected possible sources of experimental imperfections such as atom loss during melting or depletion caused by final finite interactions .",
    "the possibility of creating macroscopic superposition states via the adiabatic melting of on - site entangled mi states in an infinitely connected lattice was also briefly considered in @xcite .",
    "an examination of the adiabatic melting in an infinitely connected lattice , including the effect of the dynamical relative phase acquired by the state can be found in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend the results in @xcite and analyze the melting of on - site superposition states in a lattice with only nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "we show that the final sf states obtained from such on - site superposition states are highly depleted even if the initial state is a ground mi state . for the melted states we calculate the momentum distribution and the momentum space particle number correlations .",
    "these quantities are experimentally accessible either by time of flight expansion of the cloud or via shot noise measurements @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : bhm ] we introduce the two - mode bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) and the initial mott insulating states that we consider . in section [ sec : adiabatic ] we describe the adiabatic approximation and the no - crossing rule that we use to infer the final superfluid states . in section [ sec : melt_ab ] we illustrate how one can create macroscopic twin fock states if the inter - species interaction is greater than the intra - species interaction during melting . in [ sec : messy ] we show using the symmetry properties of the initial states and a series of approximations , that an on - site entangled mi ground state melts into a highly depleted sf state in the limit of intra - species interaction greater than the inter - species interaction .",
    "in this section we introduce the two - component bhm that describes the dynamics of ultra - cold atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "we discuss its experimental feasibility and analyze the symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "finally we introduce the initial mi states under consideration .",
    "our focus is on a state - dependent optical lattice which is sufficiently deep that two hyperfine states @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the atoms are be trapped in the lowest bloch band of the lattice .",
    "the resulting system is then accurately described  @xcite by the two - component bhm with the corresponding hamiltonian ( @xmath3 ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the bosonic destruction operator for an @xmath6-atom localized in lattice site @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , while @xmath10 denotes summation over nearest - neighbors .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is the tunnelling matrix element for atoms in state @xmath1(@xmath2 ) ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the on - site intra- and inter - species interaction matrix elements , respectively .",
    "a crucial feature of the optical lattice setup is that the ratio between the tunnelling and interaction matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) is experimentally controllable via the lattice laser intensities .",
    "further independent control of the interaction matrix elements @xmath13 , @xmath14 can be achieved with feshbach resonances  @xcite , or by shifting the @xmath1 and @xmath2 atoms away from each other using state - dependent lattices  @xcite .",
    "all of these methods of control can be exploited dynamically to permit different regimes of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) to be unitarily connected .",
    "together with the long decoherence times of ultra - cold atoms this dynamical manipulation can often be implemented on near - adiabatic timescales .",
    "based on the considerable flexibility of the optical lattice setup we make a number of simplifications in our analysis .",
    "first , we restrict the couplings to the symmetric case where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "second , we consider states of the system @xmath17 in which the lattice is commensurately filled with two atoms per site so @xmath18 has @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the total particle number and @xmath21 is the total number of sites .",
    "finally , we confine our attention to a 1d lattice with periodic boundary conditions ( i.e. @xmath22 ) in addition to the spatial homogeneity of the matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) .",
    "this is not only a good approximation for the center of a large system , where trapping and boundary effects have a negligible influence , but is also directly applicable to recently demonstrated ring - shaped optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "the most basic conserved quantity of the two - component bhm is the total number of atoms @xmath23 , @xmath24 in the either of the internal states @xmath1 or @xmath2 , respectively . with the additional assumptions outlined a number of other symmetries",
    "arise which we exploit in this work .",
    "the homogeneity and periodic boundary conditions assumed results in translational invariance . to exploit this",
    "we introduce quasi - momentum operators for each component as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the quasi - momentum in the first brillouin zone and @xmath27 is the position of the site @xmath7 .",
    "the quasi - momentum states spanning the first brillouin zone have @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 being the distance between lattice sites . for @xmath21",
    "even @xmath31 and @xmath32 , while for @xmath21 odd @xmath33 .",
    "the total momentum of the system is then @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and is a conserved quantity .",
    "the total momentum generates _ cyclic _ shifts of the lattice sites , e.g. @xmath37 for the site indices of all operators , via the unitary @xmath38 .",
    "its action on the bosonic creation operators is @xmath39 simultaneously for all sites @xmath7 .",
    "the homogeneity of the system also gives mirror reflection symmetry in which site indices for operators interchange as @xmath40 .",
    "in this case the _ parity _ operator @xmath41 is the conserved quantity and implements the transformation @xmath42 simultaneously for all sites @xmath7 .",
    "finally , the homogeneity and symmetry of the matrix elements result in _ color _ inversion symmetry @xmath43 . like parity",
    "there is a hermitian - unitary operator @xmath44 which is the conserved quantity and implements the transformation @xmath45 simultaneously for all sites @xmath7 .",

    "it follows that any of its eigenstates which are connected by a combination of these symmetry operators are necessarily degenerate",

    "other types of degeneracies can occur when the couplings attain a particular value which indicates that at this point the system acquires a higher symmetry as compared to other points .",
    "this enhancement of symmetry frequently occurs in the limits of zero or infinite coupling .",
    "an important example in this work is when @xmath47 where @xmath46 decouples into a set of single - site hamiltonians and acquires full permutational symmetry .",

    "our approach to exploit the two - component bhm to engineer quantum states is based on using two experimentally accessible initial states .",
