    "this conclusion was criticized by lukash & rubakov ( 2008 ) .",
    "the importance of the de for the structure of the local galaxy cluster ( lc ) depends on the level of the influence of de on the dynamic properties .",
    "in particular , it is necessary to check , if the lc may exist in the equilibrium state , at present values of de density , and the lc densities of matter , consisting of the baryonic and dark matter ( bm and dm ) .    here",
    ", we construct , in newtonian approximation , exact equilibrium configurations of the selfgravitating objects in presence of de . we consider a polytropic equation of state , having in mind , that very extended configurations , like lc , where the dark matter have not reached the state of a full thermodynamic equilibrium , and effective temperature could be not a constant over the cluster . in presence of de ( @xmath2 )",
    "the polytropic configurations are represented by a family of configurations , instead of the single model for each polytropic index @xmath4 .",
    "the additional parameter @xmath9 represents the ratio of the density of de to the matter central density of the configuration . for values of @xmath3 , corresponding to the polytropic powers @xmath10 , we find the limiting values of @xmath11 , so that at @xmath12 there are no equilibrium configurations and only expanding cluster , may be with a hubble flow , may exist .",
    "we apply these results to the lc using the observational data and different suggestions , connected with dm distribution .",
    "note that the structure of the isothermal configurations in a box , in presence of de was investigated by de vega & siebert ( 2005 ) : in this paper the authors were interested in the problem of thermodynamic stability of such configurations , following the works of antonov ( 1962 ) and lynden - bell & wood ( 1968 ) .",
    "we have derived a virial theorem for the equilibrium configurations in presence of de , and investigate an influence of the de on the dynamic stability of the equilibrium configurations , using an approximate energetic method .",
