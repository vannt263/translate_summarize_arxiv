    "the analysis of the @xmath4 dissociation cross section is important for understanding the suppression of @xmath4 production observed in pb - pb collisions by the na50 collaboration at the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) @xcite .",
    "there are a number of theoretical calculations on the @xmath5 + light hadron cross sections ( see , e.g. , the review ref .",
    "however , they give widely divergent results , which implies that one is still far away from a real understanding of the scattering mechanism .",
    "the nonrelativistic quark model has been applied in @xcite and @xcite for the calculation of the cross sections for the dissociation processes @xmath6 .",
    "the calculated cross sections for the reactions @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 have the following common features : they rise very fast from zero at threshold to a maximum value and finally fall off due the gaussian form of the potential .",
    "the magnitude of the maximum total cross section was found to be @xmath11 mb at @xmath3 gev in @xcite and a somewhat smaller value of @xmath12 mb at @xmath13 gev in @xcite .",
    "another approach to studying the charm dissociation process started with the model proposed by matinian and mller @xcite .",
    "they assumed that the dissociation cross section is dominated , in the @xmath14 channel , by the d meson exchange .",
    "a generalization of this approach can be found in @xcite where an effective chiral su(4 ) lagrangian was employed .",
    "such an approach seems to us quite problematic for the following reasons : ( i ) su(4 ) is a badly broken symmetry , and ( ii ) some of the couplings in the chiral su(4 ) lagrangian are unknown . nevertheless , this is a relativistic approach that allows one to study the above processes in a systematic fashion . in this framework ,",
    "the dissociation cross section of @xmath4 by light hadrons is predicted to be , near the physical threshold , in the range 1 - 10 mb .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to refer to the paper @xcite , where the @xmath4 dissociation by @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons was examined in the meson exchange model @xcite and compared to the quark interchange model .",
    "the authors of this paper found that the meson exchange model could give predictions similar to those of the quark interchange models , not only for the magnitudes but also for the energy dependence of the low - energy dissociation cross sections of the @xmath4 by @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons .",
    "it appears that the microscopic quark nature of hadrons is important in the charm dissociation processes .",
    "the first step is to calculate the relevant form factors corresponding to the triple and quartic meson vertices in the kinematical region of the dissociation reaction .",
    "qcd sum rules have been used in refs .",
    "@xcite to evaluate those form factors and to determine the charm cross section .",
    "the cross section was found to be about 1 mb at @xmath3 gev with a monotonic growth when the energy is increased  @xcite .",
    "an approach based on the 1/n expansion in qcd combined with the regge theory gives , for the total dissociation cross section , a value of a few millibarns near to @xmath17 gev @xcite .",
    "we also mention the work of deandrea _",
    "et al . _ , where the strong couplings @xmath18 and @xmath19 were evaluated in the constituent quark model @xcite . finally , an extension of the finite - temperature dyson - schwinger equation approach to heavy mesons and its application to the reaction @xmath20 was considered in @xcite .",
    "we employ a relativistic quark model @xcite to calculate the charm dissociation amplitudes and cross sections .",
    "this model is based on an effective lagrangian which describes the coupling of hadrons @xmath21 to their constituent quarks .",
    "the coupling strength is determined by the compositeness condition @xmath22 @xcite where @xmath23 is the wave function renormalization constant of the hadron @xmath21 .",
    "one starts with an effective lagrangian written down in terms of quark and hadron fields .",
    "then , by using feynman rules , the s - matrix elements describing the hadronic interactions are given in terms of a set of quark diagrams .",
    "in particular , the compositeness condition enables one to avoid a double counting of the hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the approach is self - consistent and universally applicable .",
    "all calculations of physical observables are straightforward .",
    "the model has only a small set of adjustable parameters given by the values of the constituent quark masses and the scale parameters that define the size of the distribution of the constituent quarks inside a given hadron .",
    "the values of all fit parameters are within the window of expectations .",
    "the shape of the vertex functions and the quark propagators can in principle be found from an analysis of the bethe - salpeter and dyson - schwinger equations as was done , e.g. , in @xcite . in this paper , however , we choose a phenomenological approach where the vertex functions are modeled by a gaussian form , the size parameter of which is determined by a fit to the leptonic and radiative decays of the lowest - lying light , charm , and bottom mesons . for the quark propagators we use a local representation .",
    "we calculate the amplitudes and the cross sections of the charm dissociation processes @xmath24 these processes are described by both box and resonance diagrams which can be calculated straightforwardly in our approach .",
    "we compare our results with the results of other studies .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly discuss our relativistic quark model . in sec .",
    "iii we outline the calculational technique of the arbitrary @xmath25-point one - loop diagrams with local propagators and gaussian vertex functions .",
    "we give explicit result for the triangle and box diagrams which are the building blocks of the charm dissociation amplitudes . in sec .",
    "iv we calculate the charm dissociation amplitudes and the total cross sections . in sec v we perform the numerical analysis and give our prediction for the cross sections .",
    "the coupling of a meson @xmath21 to its constituent quarks @xmath26 and @xmath27 is determined by the lagrangian @xmath28 here , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are gell - mann and dirac matrices which describe the flavor and spin quantum numbers of the meson field @xmath31 .",
    "the function @xmath32 is related to the scalar part of the bethe - salpeter amplitude and characterizes the finite size of the meson . to satisfy translational invariance",
    ", the function @xmath32 has to satisfy the identity @xmath33 for any four - vector @xmath34 . in the following we use a particular form for the vertex function , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the correlation function of two constituent quarks with masses @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .    the coupling constant @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ lagr_str ] ) is determined by the so - called _ compositeness condition _ originally proposed in  @xcite and extensively used in  @xcite .",
    "the compositeness condition requires that the renormalization constant of the elementary meson field @xmath31 is set to zero , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the derivative of the meson mass operator . in order to clarify the physical meaning of this condition",
    ", we note that @xmath43 is also interpreted as the matrix element between a physical particle state and the corresponding bare state . for @xmath22",
    "it then follows that the physical state does not contain the bare one and is described as a bound state .",
    "the interaction lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ lagr_str ] ) and the corresponding free lagrangian describe both the constituents ( quarks ) and the physical particles ( hadrons ) which are bound states of the quarks . as a result of the interaction , the physical particle is dressed , i.e. , its mass and wave function have to be renormalized .",
    "the condition @xmath22 also effectively excludes the constituent degrees of freedom from the physical space and thereby guarantees that a double counting of physical observables is avoided .",
    "the constituent quarks exist in virtual states only .",
    "one of the corollaries of the compositeness condition is the absence of a direct interaction of the dressed charged particle with the electromagnetic field .",
    "taking into account both the tree - level diagram and the diagrams with the self - energy insertions into the external legs yields a common factor @xmath23 which is equal to zero .",
    "we refer the interested reader to our previous papers @xcite where these points are discussed in more detail .",
    "we briefly discuss the introduction of the electromagnetic field into the nonlocal lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ lagr_str ] ) in a gauge invariant manner .",
    "this can be accomplished by using the path exponential @xcite @xmath44 where    @xmath45    and where @xmath46 is a coordinate point on the path @xmath47 . at first sight",
    "it appears that the results depend on the path @xmath47 which connects the end points @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the path integral in eq .",
    "( [ path ] ) .",
