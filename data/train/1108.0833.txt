    "standing at the intersection of research interests of sociology , statistical physics , economics and many other disciplines , the study of human behaviors has attracted lots of attention in recent years .",
    "nowadays , the main scientific interests are moving from qualitative hypotheses and conclusions to more quantitative ones @xcite .",
    "traditionally , the pattern of individual behavior is thought to be a random process conforming to the poisson law , which leads to an exponential time interval distribution@xcite . under such assumption , the probability density function of the time interval @xmath0 between two consecutive events has the form of @xmath1 .",
    "+ however , more and more evidences from the study of human behaviors reveal an alternative situation in coherence with a non - poisson process @xcite , whose characteristic is that the events erupt within certain time intervals , while these intervals are separated by long terms of inactiveness . those heavy - tailed distributions , emerging in many situations including sending sms @xcite , replying mails @xcite , transportation @xcite",
    ", web browsing @xcite , can be well approximated by a power - law formula @xmath2 .",
    "these discoveries have started a new research direction in _",
    "human dynamics_. besides performing empirical analysis , scientists have also proposed mathematical models to explain the underlying mechanism .",
    "et al . _ have proposed to explain the burst of human dynamics as a result of queuing process , controlled by human decision making@xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "two universality classes for human dynamics are presented , whose characteristic power - law exponents are 1 and 1.5 .",
    "+ these discoveries have great values in both scientific research and practical application .",
    "therefore , not only in physics and biology @xcite , but also in sociology and economics @xcite , human dynamics have a received wide attention .",
    "its commercial application is also attractive , e.g. , telephone service providers improvement of resource distribution and price plans @xcite , as well as urban retail trading @xcite , as brought up by barabsi .",
    "+ empirical explorations at the nascent stage of research on human dynamics are critical . without these analysis",
    "we will lost our sight of a comprehensive scenario of the real human activity patterns . in this paper , we carry out a study of the article creation of three western scientists and an eastern writer .",
    "we choose albert - lszl barabsi , mark newman and harry eugene stanley as the representatives of the western scientists and su shi as the representative of the eastern writers .",
    "barabsi , newman and stanley are accomplished scientist , and su shi is one of the most distinguished poets in chinese history .",
    "we make our choice to include people from both western and eastern culture environment , modern and ancient society , science and literature , so that the results are more comprehensive and convincing .",
    "the data of the western scientists come from science citation index expanded ( scie ) .",
    "the data of su shi come from ref.@xcite .",
    "+ our results show that the patterns of article creation obey the power - law distribution",
    ". however , different individual holds different power - law exponent .",
    "this reflect the fact that the article creation pattern can be affected by personal characteristics , so the dynamics of creation activity may be complicated .",
    "the data of the western scientists come from scie ( science citation index expanded ) .",
    "the data of su shi come from ref.@xcite .",
    "fig.[sushiyear ] illustrates the historical record of the number of articles created by su shi each year .",
    "the total numbers of records of each individual are listed in table.[record ] .",
    "the record numbers for the scientists are comparatively smaller , so we choose a larger time span unit , e.g. , @xmath3 to @xmath4 , to reduce the effect from statistical fluctuation .",
    "the record number for the chinese poet is large enough for us to choose a smaller time span unit .",
    "+        .detail of the records [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     next , we investigate the distribution of the time intervals between the creations of every two consecutive articles . the time interval is defined as @xmath5 . as shown in fig.[power ] ,",
    "all the four distributions are well described by the power law @xmath6 .",
    "the power - law exponents are @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 for stanley , barabsi , newman and su , respectively .",
    "in this paper , the temporal statistics of the article creation time intervals of three western scientists and a chinese writer are empirically studied .",
    "the distribution of the time intervals of each individual can be well approximated by the power - law distribution .",
    "this non - trivial conclusion indicates that the human article creation activities share the same law with other activities like sending sms @xcite , replying mails @xcite , transportation @xcite , and web browsing @xcite .",
    "the underlying reason of the emergent of the power - law distribution is still open to question , and further understanding of this issue is critical in human dynamics study .",
    "however , the power - law exponents of each individual are different , which reflects that there may be no universal pattern of human article creation activities .",
    "there are numerous ingredients that may impact the creation activity pattern , e.g. , memories @xcite and the interests @xcite .",
    "further research of how these ingredients can affect the pattern of creation and other activities are needed for a more comprehensive understanding of human dynamics . besides , we believe empirical studies of other creation activities , e.g. , painting , composing , inventing are also needed to understand the pattern of creation .",
