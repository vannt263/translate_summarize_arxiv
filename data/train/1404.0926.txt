    "electron transport in gases , under the effect of electric and/or magnetic fields , has been attracting continuous interest since the early years of gas discharge physics .    exact description of electron transport ( including boundary effects , relaxation phenomena , non - equilibrium effects , etc . ) requires a kinetic approach . @xcite",
    "the two powerful , equivalent , but quite different approaches to this problem are ( i ) calculations based on the boltzmann equation ( be ) , and ( ii ) simulations based on monte carlo ( mc ) techniques .",
    "both methods make it possible to obtain the central quantity of the kinetic theory , the _ velocity distribution function _ , @xmath2 , of the particles .",
    "be methods calculate @xmath3 directly , while mc methods follow a large number of individual particles to `` build up '' @xmath3 from sampling and averaging particle phase space coordinates .",
    "both be and mc methods have been used , separately or jointly , for the description of a wide variety of phenomena in ionized gases , and have also been cross checked with each other in a number of studies . @xcite    the effects of _ electron - electron collisions _ on swarm and discharge plasma characteristics have been considered only in a fraction of studies .",
    "these works have concluded that coulomb collisions can be neglected at low values of the electron density ( @xmath4 ) to neutral particle number density ( @xmath5 ) ratio , @xmath6 .",
    "however , in settings characterized by a higher @xmath0 , like the positive column and negative glow regions of dc gas discharges , bulk plasma regions of high - power radio - frequency discharges , as well as arc discharges , they may influence electron kinetics to a considerable extent . in the dc negative glow ,",
    "e.g. , the cold - electron temperature is established by a balance between cooling in elastic collisions with gas atoms , and heating due to coulomb collisions with hot electrons .",
    "@xcite coulomb collisions , likewise , influence the trapping of electrons in potential wells related to striations in gas discharges , @xcite modify the velocity distribution function and transport coefficients of electrons @xcite , and affect the development of negative differential conductivity .",
    "@xcite they play an import role as well in dense plasmas.@xcite    inclusion of coulomb collisions in either the be , or the mc approaches represents a significant challange , due to the long - range nature of the coulomb potential .",
    "one possible simplification is to treat the multiple electron - electron interactions as a succession of _ discrete , binary _ collisions ; this approximation has often been adopted in boltzmann equation analysis , @xcite as well in monte carlo simulations .",
    "@xcite different methods for a more efficient description of coulomb collisions have also been proposed.@xcite    this paper introduces a novel , _ approximation - free method _ for the description of the motion of electrons in a background gas , under the influence of a static external electric field and electron - electron interactions , at arbitrary ratios of the electron to the neutral particle densities .",
    "the method is based on a combination of the classical monte carlo technique and a molecular dynamics method , both of which are based on first principles , and have extensively been used in different areas of plasma physics .",
    "section ii describes the methods and their combination .",
    "the results are presented in sec .",
    "iii , while a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "while mc simulations @xcite have been routinely applied for the description of electron swarms , molecular dynamics ( md ) methods have not been used so far for such purpose , to the best knowledge of the author .",
    "md methods@xcite are well suited for the simulation of many - particle systems . by following the time - dependent trajectories of the particles in the phase space",
    ", md simulations can generate pair correlation functions , make it possible to obtain transport coefficients , and allow the identification of collective excitations and the calculation of their dispersion relations .",
    "@xcite thus , the present combination of mc and md approaches provides new insights into the physics of particle swarms via the calculation of quantities that have not been accessible from either be or mc calculations .",
    "our approach , in particular , allows observation of the ( i ) onset of pair correlations between electrons and ( ii ) emergence wave phenomena in electron swarms .",
    "the capabilities of the present method are illustrated on a model system of a swarm of electrons in argon gas , for a wide domain of the _ density ratio _ @xmath0 the classical electron gas present in our model system is described by an md procedure , as a many - body system .",
    "ions are not accounted for in these calculations , electrons interact via the ( un - screened ) coulomb potential .",
    "the interaction of the electron gas with the buffer gas is handled by a monte carlo collision procedure that is well suited for the short - range interaction of electrons with the gas atoms .",
    "the model system is assumed to be homogeneous and infinite , in other words , we establish a zero - dimensional model , in which two parameters , the reduced electric field ( @xmath7 ) and the ratio of the electron density to the neutral density ( @xmath0 ) fully characterize the system .    in the md simulation",
    "the phase space trajectories of the ( classical ) electrons ( @xmath8 ) are followed via the integration of their equations of motion : @xmath9 where the sum gives the force acting on particle @xmath10 by all other particles , and @xmath11 is the ( negative ) charge of the electron .",
    "the electric field , @xmath12 , is homogeneous , the @xmath13 unit vector points into the @xmath14 direction .",
    "( note that in the absence of the interaction of the electrons with a background gas the electrons would continuously be accelerated due to the external field , which will , however , not be the case when e@xmath15+ar atoms collisions take place . )",
    "the motion of the electrons is simulated inside a cubic box , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the determination of the long - ranged coulomb forces acting on the particles is the key question in the method , as calculation of the interparticle forces requires summation not only over all other particles within the box , but also over all the periodic replicas of the simulation box , to infinity .",
    "we adopt the particle - particle particle - mesh ( pppm ) approach @xcite to solve this problem .",
    "the simulations describe a micro - canonical ensemble , where the number of particles , the volume of the system and energy are conserved .",
    "the absolute size of the simulation box does not play a role .",
    "the upper limit for the time step , @xmath16 , of the integration of ( [ eq : eom ] ) is set by the stability requirement , at the closest approach of two particles , @xmath17 .",
    "here @xmath18 is a pre - defined maximum energy @xcite , which has to be chosen carefully , to ensure that the probability of finding electrons with @xmath19 is vanishingly small at the conditions considered .    the electron gas and the background gas interact via e@xmath15+ar collisions .",
    "we adopt the simplified cross section set @xcite that includes elastic collisions , excitation to one effective level , and ionization .",
    "the probability of an e@xmath15+ar collision during a time step @xmath16 is calculated as:@xcite @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the total cross section , and @xmath22 is the actual velocity of the given electron .",
    "@xmath23 is calculated for each electron in each time step , and decision about the occurrence of a collision is made by comparing it with a random number .",
    "the type of the collision is selected randomly , based on the magnitudes of the cross sections of the individual possible processes , at the given electron velocity .",
    "all types of collisions are assumed to scatter electrons isotropically . as a simplification ,",
    "ionization , is treated as a conservative process , and we adopt the cold - gas approximation in the numerical description of e@xmath15+ar collisions .    we cover the 5 td@xmath24 20 td domain of the reduced electric field , relevant to swarm conditions and to low - field regions of gas discharges .",
    "the electron to neutral density ratio ( @xmath0 ) is varied within the range from zero to 10@xmath1 .",
    "we use @xmath18 = 35 ev for the maximum electron energy , that defines the simulation time step @xmath16 .",
    "( the correctness of this choice is confirmed by the simulation results . )",
    "we follow the motion of @xmath25 = 10,000 electrons inside a cubic simulation box .",
    "( using of a fixed number of particles is made possible by treating ionization as a conservative process . )",
    "the temperature of the background gas is @xmath26 = 300 k.",
    "the simulation runs consist of an ( i ) initial equilibration phase and a subsequent ( ii ) measurement phase . at the initialization of the simulations",
    "each electron is placed at a random position inside the simulation box , and is assigned to have @xmath27 = 1 ev energy and a velocity vector pointing in a random direction over a unit sphere . as this is clearly far from the equilibrium velocity distribution , the system needs time to equilibrate .",
    "this equilibration ( as well as the stability of the simulation ) is monitored by calculating the time - dependence of the first four moments of the instantaneous @xmath28 distribution function , @xmath29 .",
    "these moments are normalized by those characterizing a maxwellian distribution : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the mean electron energy , and @xmath33 is the electron mass .",
    "the normalized moments convey information about the `` similarity '' of the distribution function @xmath34 obtained for the given conditions , with a maxwellian . in the calculation of the velocity moments",
    "the `` instantaneous drift velocity '' ( average @xmath35 at a given time ) is subtracted from the velocities of the individual particles ( thus for a drifting maxwellian distribution all normalized moments are equal to 1 ) .",
