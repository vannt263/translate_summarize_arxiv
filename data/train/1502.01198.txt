    "sub - poissonian statistics of vibrational states is a pure quantum propriety of an oscillating system .",
    "the domain of this statistics starts at the limit of a classical coherent state having a poissonian distributed quanta and may end up with a pure fock state at the other limit .",
    "studies on the quanta statistics had already revealed many pure quantum features for different physical systems and remarkable results were achieved in a large spectrum of photonic quantum electrodynamics s ( qed ) applications @xcite as well as in bose - einstein condensate s ( bec ) physics @xcite .",
    "more recently , successful experiments in cooling and detection of mechanical systems in the near ground state domain @xcite enhanced a particular interest in the research of similar features in the acoustical domain , due to bosonic quantification of the sound s vibrations .",
    "earlier experiments in laser generation of coherent phonons in different bulk materials @xcite were succeeded by new optomechanical and electromechanical setups in phonon qed , achieving important experimental results in the acoustical analog of the optical laser by using piezoelectrically excited electromechanical resonators @xcite and laser driven compound microcavities @xcite or trapped ions @xcite . in the meantime ,",
    "theoretical models propose improvements in the background theory of the experiments like the pt - symmetry approach @xcite and two cavity optomechanics @xcite , as well as new possible setups using vibrating membranes @xcite , quantum dots embedded in semiconductor lattices @xcite and becs under the action of magnetic cantilever @xcite .",
    "moreover , quantum features like sub - poissonian distributed phonon fields have been already predicted in optomechanical setups based on vibrating mirrors @xcite and in single - electron transistors @xcite as well as phonon antibunching @xcite , squeezing @xcite and negative wigner function of phonon states @xcite .",
    "in addition to increasing performances of the optomechanical devices @xcite , reports on the art - of - the - state of acoustical cavities @xcite have shown good phonon trapping in bulk materials with high cavity quality factors , thus leading to the concept of acoustical analog of photon cavity - qeds ( cqed ) .    in this article , we study the model of a coherent phonon generator in a setup consisting of a qubit embedded in an acoustical cavity involving strong qd - phonon - cavity coupling regime .",
    "the qubit , i.e. a two - level quantum dot , is driven by an intense laser field and acts as a phonon source .",
    "under action of laser light the electron jumps from the qd s valence band to the conductance band leaving a `` hole '' in the valence band .",
    "the created exciton ( electron - hole ) represents the qd s excited state and interacts with the acoustical vibrations , thus , creating or annihilating phonons in the cavity .",
    "we demonstrate that in analogy with recent experiments in photon cqed @xcite the strong qubit - resonator couplings may reveal additional quantum phenomena in the phonon cqed s domain .",
    "particularly , we show that in this regime the generated steady - state phonon field obeys sub - poissonian phonon statistics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii a detailed description of the model is given , i.e. , after an introduction of the used nomenclature we focus on simplifying the system s hamiltonian in order to arrive at an easy solvable master equation for the reduced density operator of the qd - phonon system . in sec .",
    "iii , we present a general overview over the model s results and we further discuss the important aspects of the study . the summary is given in sec .",
    "a two - level laser - pumped semiconductor quantum dot is embedded in an acoustical nanocavity ( see also @xcite ) . the qd s transition frequency between its ground state @xmath0 and the excited state @xmath1",
    "is denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "the excited qd may spontaneously emit a photon with @xmath3 being the corresponding decay rate , see fig .",
    "[ fig ] . for a more realistic case",
    ", we introduce the dephasing losses rate through @xmath4 .",
    "the single mode cavity phonons of frequency @xmath5 are described by the anihilation @xmath6 and the creation @xmath7 operators , respectively .",
    "the system s hamiltonian is : @xmath8 where the qd s operators are defined as : @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 obeying the standard commutation relations for su(2 ) algebra .",
    "the first two terms correspond , respectively , to the unperturbed qd and to the free single mode phonon hamiltonians .",
    "the third term corresponds to the qd - laser interaction within rotating wave and dipole approximations whereas @xmath12 is the laser frequency .",
    "the last term describes the qd - phonon - cavity interaction with @xmath13 being the coupling strength constant .    in what follows",
    ", we describe the hamiltonian in a frame rotating at the laser frequency @xmath12 and apply the dressed - state transformation : @xmath14 where @xmath15 while @xmath16 is the detuning of the laser from the qd s transition frequency .",
    "the dressed - state system s hamiltonian becomes then : @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "the new qd s operators are : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 satisfying the commutation relations",
    "@xmath24= \\pm r_{z } $ ] and @xmath25=\\pm 2 r^{\\mp}$ ] .",
    "again , one performs an unitary transformation to the system s hamiltonian , @xmath26 , and represents it as follows : @xmath27 instead of making the usual secular approximation @xcite we do keep the fast rotating terms in the qd - phonon - cavity interaction hamiltonian .",
    "their main contribution is evaluated as @xcite : @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is a constant and can be dropped as it does not contribute to the system s dynamics .",
    "notice that the coupling regimes are related not only to the qd - phonon - cavity coupling constant @xmath13 but also to the contribution coming from fast rotating terms , i.e. @xmath32 and @xmath33 , proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "consequently , for weak qd - phonon couplings strengths @xmath13 the fast rotating terms contribution can be neglected , i.e. , @xmath35 . for strong qd - phonon coupling regimes",
    "the secular approximation is no longer justified and the contribution of @xmath36 plays a role which will be considered .",
    "thus , the final hamiltonian @xmath37 is : @xmath38 to solve the qd - phonon system s dynamics one uses the density matrix formalism for the reduced density operator @xmath39 : @xmath40 + \\mathcal{l}_{qd } \\rho + \\mathcal{l}_{ph } \\rho ,   \\label{meq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the liouville superoperators @xmath41 and @xmath42 describe , respectively , the qd s and phonons dissipative effects . in the bare state representation",
    "qd s dissipation processes are expressed by the following spontaneous emission term : @xmath43 -\\gamma_{c } [ s_{z } , s_{z } \\rho ] + \\text{h.c.}$ ] @xcite . in the dressed - state basis and within the secular approximation , i.e. @xmath44",
    ", the same processes are described by three terms determined by the qd s dressed - state decay rates : @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath48",
    "-\\gamma_{- }   [ r^{- } , r^{+ } \\rho ]   \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\gamma_{0 }   [ r_{z } , r_{z } \\rho ] + \\text{h.c . } .",
    "\\label{lossqd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the phonons from the multilayered acoustical cavity are allowed to interact with the environmental thermal reservoir . in the rotating wave approximation",
    "this process is described by two terms corresponding respectively to the cavity s damping and pumping effects at a rate proportional to @xmath49 determined by the cavity s quality factor @xmath50 @xcite : @xmath51 -\\kappa \\bar{n } [ b , b^{\\dagger } \\rho ] + \\text{h.c.}. \\label{lossph}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath52 is the mean thermal phonon number corresponding to frequency @xmath5 and environmental temperature @xmath53 .",
    "once the master equation is determined by eqs .",
    "( [ hfinal])-([lossph ] ) , it is solved by projecting the density operator firstly in the qd s basis and then in the phonon field s basis @xcite . the projection in the qd s dressed state basis leads after some rearrangements to a system of six coupled differential equations involving the following variables : @xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56 , are the qd s density matrix elements .",
    "finally , the projection in the phonon fock states basis @xmath57 gives a set of infinite differential equations , namely , @xmath58",
    "@xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 here @xmath64 while @xmath65",
    ".    in the next section we shall describe the cavity phonon dynamics in the steady - state via second - order phonon - phonon correlation function as well as the mean phonon number .",
    "consequently , the average phonon number in the cavity mode is expressed as : @xmath66 the nanocavity second - order phonon - phonon correlation function is defined as usual @xcite , @xmath67 the system of eqs .",
    "( [ meqqdph1 ] ) - ( [ meqqdph6 ] ) as well as the infinite series in the expressions ( [ n ] ) - ( [ g2 ] ) must be truncated at a particular value of @xmath68 such that the variables of interest remain unchanged if one further increases @xmath69 @xcite .    in what follows , we shall study the system in the steady - state regime , i.e. , @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "the second - order correlation function given by eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) and the average phonon number in eq .",
    "( [ n ] ) are used to describe the phonon field behaviors in the acoustical cavity mode @xcite .",
    "once truncated , the system of coupled equations ( [ meqqdph1 ] ) - ( [ meqqdph6 ] ) is solved by setting the model s parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .    a general overview over the steady - state system s behavior in the strong coupling regime or within the secular approximation , i.e. when @xmath74 , is presented in fig .",
    "the phonon field s statistics is described by the second - order correlation function @xmath75 with @xmath76 describing the poissonian phonon distribution while when @xmath77 one has sub - poissonian phonon statistics .",
    "one observes that moderate laser - qd coupling strengths , i.e. @xmath78 , as well as lower temperatures give a more prominent sub - poissonian phonon statistics .",
    "furthermore , beyond the secular approximation , the phonon statistics exhibits quantum features , i.e. @xmath79 ( compare the corresponding curves in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) and the effect is more pronounced for stronger qd - phonon coupling strengths .",
    "[ fig1](b ) shows , beyond the secular approximation , the second - order phonon - phonon correlation function as a function of @xmath80 . here , again , around @xmath81 one has a quantum phonon effect , i.e. sub - poissonian phonon statistics .",
    "thus , the contribution to the system s dynamics of the fast rotating terms @xmath36 evaluated by the eq .",
    "( [ hfast ] ) are essential for a sub - poissonian quantum feature , see fig .  [ fig1 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we compare our result within and beyond the secular approximation .",
    "the second - order correlation function estimated in both cases converges for higher and smaller cavity damping rates .",
    "however , for lower values of @xmath80 quantum features are proper only beyond the secular approximation ( see the inset picture in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the mean phonon number decreases in this particular case although it is quite high comparing to the @xmath81 situation .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the phonon quantum statistics in an acoustical nanocavity .",
    "a laser - pumped two - level quantum dot is embedded in the cavity contributing to phonon quantum dynamics .",
    "we have demonstrated that stronger qd - phonon - cavity coupling regimes lead to quantum features of the cavity phonon field in the steady - state .",
    "this qd - cavity interaction regime obliges to go beyond the secular approximation .",
    "ignoring this fact would lead to an erroneous estimation of the phonon statistics for some parameter domains .",
