    "a central and so far experimentally unexplored element of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking . indirect evidence from precision measurements at @xmath6 colliders",
    "suggests the existence of a light higgs boson in the mass range of @xmath10  gev at the 95% confidence level with a statistical preference towards the lower end @xcite . _ a priori _ , more complicated higgs sectors are phenomenologically just as viable .",
    "a well known example is provided by the general two doublet higgs model ( 2dhm ) @xcite .",
    "a constrained version of the 2dhm is in fact a part of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , where spontaneous symmetry breaking is induced by two complex higgs doublets leading to five physical scalars .",
    "the lightest of these is predicted to have a mass below the @xmath11 boson although radiative corrections can soften that limit up to about @xmath12  gev due to the large value of the top mass .    in the mssm",
    "there are only two parameters in the extended higgs sector , conventionally chosen to be the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the up and down type higgs bosons , @xmath8 , and the mass @xmath13 of the predicted neutral pseudoscalar higgs . at tree level",
    "all other parameters are then fixed .",
    "the main physics objectives of a future linear @xmath6 collider depend crucially on what has been discovered at either lep2 , the tevatron or the lhc .",
    "if no higgs bosons would be discovered at any of these machines the main objective will be to perform precision tests of anomalous vector boson couplings to look for evidence of new physics at higher energy scales .",
    "if supersymmetry is discovered , through the production of new particles for example , then it is mandatory to investigate the precise structure of its manifestation in order to hopefully have access to physics at scales where the standard model couplings become equal and even gravity enters . even if ` only '",
    "a sm higgs is discovered , there will still be many unresolved issues concerning the validity domain and origin of sm physics .",
    "a common feature of all these possible scenarios is that a high degree of experimental and theoretical precision will be required at a linear collider to gain deeper insight into the structure of the physical laws of nature . in this context",
    "the photon - photon ` compton - collider ' option , from backscattered laser light off highly energetic and polarized electron beams @xcite , is a valuable ingredient .",
    "it can provide complementary information about certain physical parameters which enter in different reactions , compared to the @xmath6 mode , at comparable event rates . in the higgs sector",
    ", the compton collider option offers a unique way to obtain a precise determination of the partial @xmath14 width .",
    "this quantity is important in two respects .",
    "first , it allows for the model independent determination of the total higgs width , given that the appropriate branching ratio @xmath15 has been determined ( at the lhc for instance ) .",
    "secondly , it is an important indicator of new physics as heavy charged particles which obtain their mass through the higgs mechanism do _ not _ decouple in the loop . at the lhc , pseudoscalar masses above @xmath16 gev are not detectable for a wide range of @xmath8 and for intermediate values of @xmath8 this regime reaches down to @xmath17 gev @xcite . in the mssm",
    "this means that even in this so - called decoupling limit the diphoton partial higgs width could reveal the mass of the heavy pseudoscalar .",
    "although the mssm behaves rather like the sm for heavy @xmath13 , studies suggest that the partial @xmath18 width can still differ by up to ten per cent @xcite .",
    "it is clear from these lines of reasoning that it is very important at this stage of the design of future linear colliders to know what the photon - photon option can contribute to the high precision measurements in the search for new physics .",
    "the purpose of this paper is therefore to investigate the level of the statistical accuracy of the determination of the partial diphoton higgs width .",
    "we focus on the processes @xmath19 with @xmath20 , and use all the available calculations relevant to these for both the intermediate mass higgs signal as well as the continuum background .",
    "the monte carlo results are then combined with expected tesla machine and detector design parameters to arrive at reliable predictions for the expected event rates .",
    "we begin by summarizing the status of the qcd corrections to the tree - level processes .",
    "in this section we begin by reviewing the qcd corrections to ( continuum ) heavy quark production in polarized photon - photon collisions .",
    "as is well known , there are two possible @xmath22 states , and at the born level one has : @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the quark velocity , @xmath25 the @xmath5 c.m .",
    "collision energy , @xmath26 the electromagnetic coupling , @xmath27 the charge of quark @xmath28 and @xmath29 its pole mass .",
    "the scattering angle of the produced ( anti)quark relative to the beam direction is denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "[ eq : bj0 ] clearly displays the important feature that the @xmath3 cross section has a relative @xmath31 suppression compared to the @xmath32 cross section @xcite . since the higgs @xmath33 process only occurs for @xmath34 ,",
    "it is this polarization that is crucial for the precision measurement of the higgs partial decay width .",
    "however the overall @xmath31 factor in the @xmath3 cross section implies that , unlike for eq .",
    "[ eq : bj2 ] , potentially large radiative corrections with logarithmic mass singularities are _ not _ forbidden by the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg theorem @xcite .",
    "this will become important in the next section where we discuss large double logarithmic ( dl ) corrections to this cross section .",
    "in contrast , the qcd corrections in the @xmath32 case are not expected to be large .    for both helicity configurations the exact differential one - loop corrections",
    "are known @xcite and are included in the calculations reported in this paper . for the @xmath32 helicity configuration , which",
    ", if we assume a high level of efficiency for producing the @xmath34 state , is expected to be heavily suppressed , these are sufficient for our purposes .",
    "for the zero helicity configuration the large logarithmic corrections _",
    "are _ phenomenologically important , and so we discuss them in more detail in the next section .",
    "the dominant background to higgs production below 140  gev is @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "while this background is suppressed by @xmath37 at the born level , as shown above , higher - order qcd radiative corrections in principle remove this suppression @xcite .",
    "in addition , large virtual non - sudakov double @xmath38 logarithms ( dl ) are present which at one - loop can even lead to a negative cross section @xcite .",
    "the physical nature of these novel dl - effects was elucidated in ref .",
    "@xcite . there ,",
    "the two - loop contribution to the non - sudakov form factor was calculated and it was shown that it allows for reasonable qualitative estimates .",
    "in particular , positivity to the cross section was restored . in ref .",
    "@xcite the first explicit three - loop results in the dl approximation were presented which revealed a factorization of non - sudakov and sudakov double logarithms for this process and led to the all - orders resummation in the form of a confluent hypergeometric function @xmath39 : @xmath40 \\right ) \\label{eq : vps}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the one - loop non - sudakov form factor , @xmath42 is taken as a fixed parameter , and @xmath43 is the soft - gluon upper energy limit .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that one needs to include at least _ four _ loops ( at the cross section level ) of the non - sudakov logarithms in order to achieve positivity and stability . at this level of approximation",
    "there is an additional major source of uncertainty in the scale choice of the qcd coupling , two possible ` natural ' choices  @xmath44 and @xmath45  yielding very different numerical results .",
    "however in ref .",
    "@xcite this uncertainty was largely removed by employing the renormalization group to introduce a _ running _ qcd coupling .",
    "we briefly summarize the results in the next section .      in the derivation of the leading logarithmic corrections in ref .",

    "the effective scale is also given by @xmath49 as the dominant double logarithmic phase space is given by @xmath50 @xcite ( on a formal dl level , setting @xmath51 yields the massless sudakov form factor ) .",

    "@xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 and for qcd we have @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 as usual .",
    "up to two - loops the massless @xmath59-function is independent of the chosen renormalization scheme and is gauge invariant in minimally subtracted schemes to all orders @xcite .",
    "these features also hold for the renormalization group improved form factors below .    for the massive sudakov form factor",
    "we use the on - shell condition @xmath60 , even though the running coupling will now depend on _ two _ integration variables . since in this work we are only able to include the hard _ one - gluon _ matrix elements ( the exact nnlo corrections are presently unknown ) , the higher - order terms will inevitably be energy cut ( @xmath61 ) dependent . however our two - jet definition ( see below ) automatically restricts the higher - order hard gluon radiation phase space such that it is reasonable to neglect more than one gluon emission .",
    "the complete result for the renormalization group improved massive sudakov form factor is then given by @xcite : @xmath62 assuming only @xmath63 .",
    "expanding in @xmath64 gives the dl - sudakov form factor in eq .",

    "@xcite it was shown that eq .",
    "[ eq : rpvrgex ] exponentiates in analogy to the soft exponential term in eq .  [ eq : vps ] .",
    "the reason for adopting the above soft gluon energy regulator rather than the more conventional @xmath67 invariant mass prescription ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for instance ) is connected with the straightforward dl - phase space of the _ massive _ sudakov form factor .",
    "the latter is thus convenient for the inclusion of the renormalization group effects as outlined above .",

    "[ fig : rg ] we find , after an order - by - order integration over the appropriate running coupling for the complete virtual renormalization group improved non - sudakov form factor : @xmath69 and thus for the rg - improved virtual plus soft real cross section we have @xmath70     +    where the rg - improved massive sudakov form factor is given in eq .",
    "[ eq : rpvrgex ] .",
    "the effect of the renormalization group improved virtual plus soft real bremsstrahlung cross section is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vps ] .",
    "the rg - improved cross section obtained using eq .",
    "[ eq : srg ] lies between the theoretically allowed upper and lower limits given by the double logarithmic form factor of eq .",
    "[ eq : vps ] with @xmath42 evaluated at the bottom mass and the higgs mass scale . for a lower value of the energy cutoff @xmath61 the background is more suppressed but the higher order ( uncanceled ) @xmath61-dependence is stronger .",
    "this latter technical problem can be reduced by identifying @xmath61 with the physical energy cutoff of the detector efficiencies .",
    "this will be discussed in section [ sec : nr ] .",
    "an intermediate mass higgs boson has a very narrow total decay width .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to compare the total number of higgs signal events with the number of ( continuum ) background events integrated over a narrow energy window around the higgs mass .",
    "the size of this window depends on the level of monochromaticity that can be achieved for the polarized photon beams .    in general ,",
    "the number of events for the ( signal ) process @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the center of mass energy .",
    "for @xmath75 we have the following breit - wigner cross section , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath76 where the conversion factor @xmath77  fb  gev@xmath78 . in the narrow width approximation",
    "we then find for the expected number of events @xmath79 to quantify this , we take the design parameters of the proposed tesla linear collider @xcite , which correspond to an integrated peak @xmath80-luminosity of 15 fb@xmath81 for the low energy running of the compton collider .",
    "the polarizations of the incident electron beams and the laser photons are chosen such that the product of the helicities @xmath82 .",
    "this ensures high monochromaticity and polarization of the photon beams @xcite . within this scenario",
    "a typical resolution of the higgs mass is about 10  gev , so that for comparison with the background process @xmath83 one can use @xcite : @xmath84 with @xmath850.5 fb@xmath81/gev .",
    "the number of background events is then given by @xmath86 in other words , the number of signal events is proportional to @xmath87 while the number of continuum heavy quark production events is proportional to @xmath88 . in principle",
    "it is possible to use the exact compton profile of the backscattered photons to obtain the full luminosity distributions . the number of expected events is then given as a convolution of the energy dependent luminosity and the cross sections .",
    "our approach described above corresponds to an effective description of these convolutions , since these functions are not precisely known at present .",
    "note that the functional forms currently used generally assume that only one scattering takes place for each photon , which may not be realistic .",
    "once the exact luminosity functions are experimentally determined it is of course trivial to incorporate them into a monte carlo program containing the physics described in this paper .",
    "we next summarize the radiative corrections entering into the calculation of the expected number of higgs events .",
    "for the quantity @xmath14 there are three main standard model contributions , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : h ] : the @xmath89 and @xmath90- and @xmath7-quark loops .",
    "we include these at the one - loop level , since the radiative corrections are significant only for the @xmath7-quark @xcite .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath91 is treated in the following way .",
    "the first component consists of the partial @xmath92 width .",
    "obviously we must use the same two - jet criterion for the signal as for the background . for our purposes a cone - type algorithm is most suitable , and so we use the sterman - weinberg two - jet definition @xcite depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : jet ] .",
    "note that the signal cross section is corrected by the _",
    "same _ resummed renormalization group improved form factor given in eq .",
    "[ eq : rpvrgex ] , since this factor does not depend on the spin of the particle coupling to the final state quark anti - quark pair .",
    "in addition we use the exact one - loop corrections from ref .",
    "these revealed that the largest radiative corrections are well described by using the running quark mass evaluated at the higgs mass scale .",
    "we therefore resum the leading running mass terms to all orders . for the real bremsstrahlung corrections we use our own @xmath93 matrix elements .",
    "an important check is obtained by integrating over all phase space and reproducing the analytical results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second quantity entering the branching ratio is the total higgs width @xmath94 .",
    "here we use the known results summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , and include the partial higgs to @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 decay widths with all relevant radiative corrections .",
    "@xcite numerical predictions were given for an ( infra - red safe ) two - jet @xmath101 cross section in @xmath5 collisions in the energy range @xmath102  gev . a modified sterman - weinberg cone definition , imposed on the final state partons was employed .",
    "thus , at leading order ( i.e. @xmath103 ) all events obviously satisfy the two@xmath7jet requirement . to ensure that both jets lie in the central region of the detector . ]",
    "this defines our ` leading order ' ( lo ) cross section . at next  to  leading order ( nlo ) we can have virtual or real gluon emission .",
    "for the latter , an event is defined as two@xmath7jet like if the emitted gluon @xmath104 we further subdivided region i according to whether the gluon energy is greater or less than the infrared cutoff @xmath61 ( @xmath105 ) .",

    "note also that the complete expression for the two - jet cross section ( with the remaining @xmath61 dependence displayed ) @xmath116 contains a mixture of exact @xmath109 and resummed pieces . for the former ,",

    "[ eq:2jetbis ] we must address the issue of the dependence on the unphysical infra - red parameter @xmath61 . if we were to expand out the resummed rg - improved form factor @xmath121 in powers of @xmath45 , and retain only the @xmath122 term , we would find that the @xmath61 dependence exactly canceled that of @xmath123 .",
    "however in the full resummed expression , there is nothing to cancel the explicit @xmath61 dependence at higher - orders .",
    "the canceling terms would come from the as yet unknown higher - order contributions to @xmath107 .",
    "faced with this dilemma , we have several choices .",
    "we could , as in @xcite , neglect the higher - order terms in the sudakov form factor altogether , and include only the non - sudakov form factor which is of course independent of @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , as shown in @xcite with the choice @xmath124 , the combined contribution of virtual gluons and real gluons with @xmath125 to @xmath126 was dominated by the non - sudakov ` @xmath127 ' part .",
    "this suggests that the most reasonable procedure for the resummed cross section is to take @xmath128 and to vary @xmath129 .",
    "we stress that this is an _ approximation _ , since it corresponds to making an assumption about the contribution of real multi - gluon emission with energies @xmath130 .    as our ` best guess ' rg - improved , resummed two - jet cross section , therefore",
    ", we have @xmath131    at this point it is appropriate to comment on detector and accelerator related issues which were adopted in our analyses @xcite . since we are not using a full detector simulation we employ effective performance parameters which should be achievable at a future linear collider .",
    "we will display results for realistic scenarios for both currently accepted and more optimistic cases .",
    "in particular the double b - tagging efficiency will be assumed to be @xmath132 throughout and the main input parameters concern the probability of counting a @xmath96-pair as @xmath95 and the ratio of the photon - pairs in a @xmath3 to @xmath133 state .",
    "we emphasize again that these dependences are in real machine environment given by functional forms which can easily be determined through test runs at a later stage .",
    "for our purposes here the effective description is sufficient .",
    "the results discussed in the next section contain all radiative corrections summarized above .",
    "the goal is to optimize the jet - parameters of the sterman - weinberg two - jet definition in order to maximize the statistical significance of the intermediate mass higgs - boson signal .",
    "we begin with a few generic remarks concerning the uncertainties in our predictions .",
    "the signal process @xmath134 is well understood and nnl calculations are available .",
    "the theoretical error is thus negligible @xcite .",
    "there are two contributions to the background process @xmath1 which we neglect in this paper .",
    "firstly , the so - called resolved photon contribution @xcite was found to be a small effect , e.g. @xcite , especially since we want to reconstruct the higgs mass from the final two - jet measurements and impose angular cuts in the forward region .",
    "in addition the good charm suppression also helps to suppress the resolved photon effects as they give the largest contribution .",
    "the second contribution we do not consider here results from the final state configuration where a soft quark is propagating down the beam pipe and the gluon and remaining quark form two hard back - to back - jets @xcite .",
    "we neglect this contribution here due to the expected excellent double b - tagging efficiency and the strong restrictions on the allowed acollinearity discussed below .    for the continuum heavy quark production cross section",
    "an exact nlo calculation exists @xcite but large radiative corrections in the @xmath3 channel require the resummation of large non - sudakov dl s as expounded on above .",
    "assuming that the largest part of the nlo and higher subleading logarithms is contained in the renormalization of the strong coupling parameter @xmath42 , the virtual corrections seem to be well under control .",
    "the largest uncertainty we thus expect to be contained in the missing hard @xmath135 bremsstrahlung corrections for which no @xmath37 suppression - factor exists .",
    "theoretically , these can be controlled by limiting the available phase - space through a narrow two - jet definition . on the other hand",
    "this means that we would also lose ( signal ) events which is clearly undesirable . in light of these two effects",
    "we think it prudent to find a balancing middle ground for our mc - results for resonant energies . ] . more details are given below .    a second source of uncertainty",
    "is contained in the higher order @xmath61-dependence as mentioned above .",
    "our strategy of identifying @xmath136 is reasonable as long as the neglected @xmath137 terms ( which have no born cross section suppression ) are negligible and can be identified with the physical detector energy cuts . in this paper",
    "we will thus study two different values for the energy cut : @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the value of @xmath129 is related to the allowed acollinearity of the two jet alignments corresponding to acollinearities of @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "we emphasize that the requirement of a small jet acollinearity substantially suppresses the @xmath133 background component and could play an important role in improving the photon collider energy resolution @xcite as well as in the suppression of the background due to the resolved processes .",
    "below we display results assuming in each case a ( realistic ) ratio of @xmath142 in parallel with the ( optimistic ) ratio of @xmath143 .",
    "we start with fig .",

    "the figure shows signal and bg events separately for two values of the thrust angle @xmath30 cut , @xmath149 and @xmath150 . in both scenarios",

    "the second largest corrections stem from the @xmath7-quark for both @xmath3 and @xmath133 while the @xmath3 @xmath151-quark contribution is small .",
    "the smaller thrust - cut two - jet definition eliminates more of the background events in relative terms .",
    "however , it also reduces the total number of events .",
    "[ fig : sbg203 ] demonstrates that the @xmath150 scenario yields roughly a 50 % higher ratio of signal to bg events .",
    "the inverse statistical significance of the higgs - boson process , defined as @xmath152 , however , is somewhat higher for the @xmath153 choice as is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sa203 ] .",
    "the difference between the realistic @xmath142 and optimistic @xmath143 photon - polarization cases is small .",
    "for the one - year running analysis of an intermediate mass higgs with @xmath154gev the inverse statistical significance is below 3% , which can be viewed as the minimal statistical expectation .",
    "it seems now possible to assume an even better detector performance .",
    "the improvement comes from assuming a better single point resolution , thinner detector modules and moving the vertex detectors closer to the beam - line @xcite .",

    "[ fig : ne201 ] , [ fig : sbg201 ] and [ fig : sa201 ] display the same observables for otherwise identical two - jet definitions and machine - parameters .",

    "we now keep @xmath153 fixed and furthermore assume the @xmath144 misidentification rate of 1% .",

    "we again emphasize , however , that in this case also the missing @xmath135 bremsstrahlung corrections could become important .",
    "the largest effect is obtained by effectively suppressing the background radiative events with the smaller energy cutoff of @xmath159 outside the cone ( the inside is of course independent of @xmath129 ) . here the lower row of fig . [",

    "we have used all relevant qcd radiative corrections to both the signal and bg production available in the literature .",

    "we conclude that statistically a measurement of the partial width @xmath14 below the 2% precision level should be possible .",

    "<S> the high precision determination of the partial width @xmath0 of an intermediate mass higgs boson is among the most important measurements at a future photon  photon collider . </S>",
    "<S> recently it was shown that large non - sudakov as well as sudakov double logarithmic corrections can be summed to all orders in the background process @xmath1 , @xmath2 , from an initially polarized @xmath3 state . in addition , running coupling corrections were included exactly to all orders by employing the renormalization group . </S>",
    "<S> thus all necessary theoretical results for calculating the higgs signal and the non - higgs continuum background contributions to the process @xmath1 are now known . </S>",
    "<S> we are therefore able to present for the first time precise predictions for the measurement of the partial width @xmath4 at the compton collider ( @xmath5 ) option at a future linear @xmath6 collider . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between signal and background is very sensitive to the experimental cuts and the ability of the detectors to identify @xmath7-quarks in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate this in some detail using a monte carlo analysis , and conclude that a measurement with a 2 % statistical accuracy should be achievable . </S>",
    "<S> this could have important consequences for the discovery of physics beyond the standard model , in particular for large masses of a pseudoscalar higgs boson as the decoupling limit is difficult and for a wide range of @xmath8 impossible to cover at the lhc proton - proton collider .    </S>",
