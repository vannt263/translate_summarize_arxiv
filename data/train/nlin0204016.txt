    "the electrochemical deposition of metals from aqueous solutions in quasi - two - dimensional geometries has proven to be a valuable test bed to examine concepts of interfacial growth like fractal growth @xcite , morphological transitions @xcite or dendritic growth @xcite .",
    "the properties of the evolving deposit are in many cases sensitive to the presence of convection currents in the solution @xcite .",
    "there are two well - known origins of convection rolls : a ) on small scales , spatial inhomogeneities of the ionic charge distribution can trigger electro - convection @xcite ; b ) density inhomogeneities due to concentration changes at the electrodes induce large scale gravity - driven convection rolls @xcite .",
    "however there is another potential source of density changes : due to the small cell volume of typically @xmath0 1@xmath1 , the dissipated electric energy can be the source of a significant heating .",
    "if the cell were completely thermally insulated , a solution exposed to an electrical power of 500mw would start to boil after 500s . while thermal conduction will confine the overall temperature increase to smaller values , considerable temperature gradients might arise and generate density driven convection .",
    "thermally induced convection rolls have been thoroughly studied in thin - layer geometries heated from below ( for a recent review see @xcite ) and the side @xcite . in contrast , the role of thermal effects was previously not examined in electrodeposition . in order to quantify the possible temperature gradients , a high spatial resolution of the temperature field is necessary .",
    "we present here measurements of the temperature field at both electrodes performed by use of an infrared camera .",
    "the so determined evolution of the temperature field can be related to the development of the concentration field , which is known from interferometric measurements @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : section  [ ch : setup ] describes our experimental setup , section  [ ch : result ] presents the measurement results , which will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ ch : conclusions ] .",
    "the measurements are performed with the infrared camera varioscan 3021-st from infratec , which contains a stirling - cooled hgcdte - detector with 360 @xmath2 240 pixel . using its macro we observe an area of 5.0 @xmath2 3.4 @xmath3 , which yields a spatial resolution of 140@xmath4 m .",
    "the maximal image capturing frequency is 1.1hz , the thermal resolution @xmath5 30mk .",
    "while the sensor is sensitive for wavelengths in the range of 8 - 12 @xmath4 m , glass plates , which are normally used as top and bottom plate of the cell , are opaque in this region .",
    "therefore the upper cell cover was realized using a polyethylene foil stretched over an aluminium frame . due to the flexibility of the polyethylene foil and a small overpressure necessary to fill the cell ,",
    "the plate separation of about 0.5 mm is not well defined .",
    "the bottom plate of the cell consists of a block of teflon , because this material has a low reflectivity in the infrared .",
    "this reduces the so called narcissism : the response of the cooled detector to its own mirror image .",
    "the electrodes are parallel zinc wires ( goodfellow 99.99% ) of 0.25 mm diameter and separated by a distance of 4 cm .",
    "fig.[fig : setup ] shows an image of the cell during an experiment .",
    "the cell is filled with an 0.1 m @xmath6 solution prepared from merck p.a .",
    "chemicals in nondeaerated ultrapure @xmath7 .",
    "the measurements are performed at a constant potential of 20 @xmath5 0.003 v. due to the current increase during the electrodeposition process , the average electrical power feed @xmath8 increases from 470mw at the beginning of the experiment to 650mw after 500s .",
    "because of the modified cell construction , the question of comparability with experiments performed in standard electrodeposition cells could be raised .",
    "therefore we calculate the heat - flux @xmath9 for the confining plates , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the area and the heat transfer coefficient of the plate .",
    "it is important to keep in mind , that @xmath12 is equivalent to @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the heat transition numbers from solution to plate resp .",
    "plate to air , @xmath16 is the heat conductivity and @xmath17 the thickness of the plate .    inserting the material parameters of our setup  @xcite and using only the area between the two electrodes , we derive a @xmath9 of 16.2mw per kelvin temperature difference for the polyethylene foil and 11.5mw / k for the teflon plate , while a typical glass plate ( schott bk 7 , 6.3 mm thick ) yields 16mw / k .",
    "so in a first approximation our setup is thermally equivalent to a standard electrodeposition cell .",
    "[ fig : setup ] shows the growing deposit at the cathode , which belongs to the homogenous morphology  @xcite .",
    "it is characterized by tip - splitting but retaining a growing front parallel to the cathode . after 500s a hecker transition",
    "@xcite takes place and the growth front breaks up into more spatially localized zones of active development .    immediately before each experiment the infrared camera takes a zero image , which is then subtracted from all images taken during the experiment .",
    "therefore the thermographies solely depict the temperature increase .",
    "[ fig : thermo ] gives an example of such a thermography after 280s , the scale at the right describes the temperature increase with respect to the beginning of the experiment .",
    "the white line marks the position of the anodic zinc wire .",
    "the temperature decrease at the left hand side of the image is caused by the thermal conductivity of the aluminium frame , the warm `` island '' in the middle is due to the inhomogeneity of the cell thickness .",
    "3.4 @xmath3 .",
    "the white line corresponds to the position of the anodic zinc wire , the rows between the black lines are averaged to produce fig .",
    "[ fig : t_dev_a].,width=325 ]    in order to improve the signal to noise ratio , zones of spatial homogeneity and a width of 9.1 mm are chosen by visual inspection . such a zone is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermo ] with two parallel black lines . inside this zone",
    "all rows are averaged , yielding a temperature increase @xmath18 , which is only a function of distance to the cathode @xmath19 and time .",
    "[ fig : t_dev_a ] shows the evolution of @xmath20 in the neighborhood of the anode .",
    "it is clearly visible that the temperature increase at the anode itself lags behind with respect to the one observed in the middle of the cell .",
    "[ fig : t_dev_k ] illustrates the evolution of the temperature field at the cathode .",
    "the most prominent feature is the existence of a local temperature maximum , denoted with small arrows .",
    "this maximum moves towards the middle of the cell , where a plateau of spatially constant temperature is located .    in order to characterize the heating process in the cell ,",
    "we pick the temperature at a distance of 25.6 mm to the cathode ( this is approximately the location , where the two convection rolls emerging from the electrodes finally meet , as will be discussed in section  [ ch : conclusions_c ] ) . referring to this point",
    ", we will speak of the _ bulk _ in the following . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk ] this temperature increase @xmath21 is given for the two experiments presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_dev_a ] and  [ fig : t_dev_k ] .",
    "the fact that the two measurements are almost identical reflects the reproducibility of the experiment .",
    "the solid line is a fit to an exponential function , which is motivated in detail in section  [ ch : conclusions_b ] .    the arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_dev_a ] represent the location , where the temperature is 20 mksmaller than @xmath21 .",
    "the distance of these points with respect to the anode is denoted @xmath22 and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : l_t ] ( a ) .",
    "its monotonous increase with time is fitted by a power law , which will be explained in section  [ ch : conclusions_a ] .",
    "correspondingly , fig .",
    "[ fig : l_t ] ( b ) shows the growth of the distance @xmath23 between the the location of the temperature maximum in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_dev_k ] and the cathode .",
    "the straight line is a fit to all data with @xmath24 100s , which will be motivated in sec .",
    "[ ch : conclusions_c ] .",
    "in principle , the energy balance involves three contributions : the electrical energy feed into the cell , the dissipated ohmic heat and the chemical reaction energy .",
    "however the short calculation presented in the appendix supports the assumption that the chemical energy contribution is mostly irrelevant .",
    "the ohmic heat dissipated at some position in the cell will be proportional to the local resistivity @xmath25 in a one - dimensional model , while @xmath26 will depend on the local ion concentration @xmath27 . in the next three subsections",
    "we will compare the evolution of the temperature field at the anode , at the cathode and in the bulk with the development of the concentration field , which is known from interferometric measurements @xcite .      at the anode @xmath28 ions",
    "go into solution , increasing the local concentration and therefore density .",
    "while this denser solution sinks down to the bottom plate , it gets replaced by less dense bulk solution .",
    "this mechanism drives a convection roll of size @xmath29 @xcite . according to the fluid dynamical description there are two growth regimes : initially during the so called immiscible fluid regime @xmath29 will grow with @xmath30 ,",
    "while after some time there will be a crossover to the diffusion hindered spreading regime with a @xmath31 growth law .",
    "chazalviel et al .",
    "@xcite showed , that both the fluid velocity @xmath32 and the ion concentration decrease with increasing distance to the electrode .",
    "the distance , where @xmath32 has dropped to zero and coincidently @xmath33 has fallen to @xmath34 , defines @xmath29 .",
    "figure  [ fig : t_dev_a ] shows that the temperature increase in the region between the anode and the arrows lags behind the one observed in the bulk . as @xmath35 translates into reduced ohmic heating , we identify the position of the arrows with the end of the anodic convection roll .",
    "a fit to its length with : @xmath36 is presented in fig  [ fig : l_t ] ( a ) . it yields : a = 0.13 @xmath5 0.01 mm and b = 0.78 @xmath5 0.01 , which indicates that the convection roll is in the immiscible fluid regime for the whole run of the experiment . according to the scaling analysis presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , this corresponds to an average plate separation of about 650@xmath4 m .      due to the growing deposit",
    ", there is a zone of ion depletion in the vicinity of the cathode , the size of which will be affected by the convection roll driven by the occuring density difference . as the decreased @xmath33 leads to higher dissipation , the increased temperature denoted by the arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_dev_k ] is qualitatively explained .",
    "the distance of the arrows to the initial cathode position @xmath37 should correspond to the actual size of the deposit .",
    "therefore we perform a linear fit with : @xmath38 which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : l_t ] ( b ) .",
    "we derive @xmath39 = 21.2 @xmath5 0.4 @xmath4 m/s , which agrees well with 20.7 @xmath5 0.8 @xmath4 m/s front velocity determined from photographs of the deposit .",
    "@xmath40 is found to be 2 @xmath5 0.1 mm .",
    "this finite distance can be explained by the absence of heat production in the metallic deposit because of its low resistivity and the fact that its heat conductivity is 190 times higher than water .",
    "so the deposit is an effective heat sink , the resulting heat flux shifts the temperature maximum into the cell .",
    "if the cathodic convection roll , apart from the fact that it starts at the actual front of the deposit , grows in the same way as the anodic roll , they meet 450s after the beginning of the experiment at a distance of 25 mm to the cathode .",
    "this corresponds to the observed change in morphology after that time .",
    "the temperature increase observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk ] can be modeled , if we assume , that the whole cell shares the constant bulk properties @xmath33 and @xmath26 and therefore @xmath41 .",
    "the supplied electrical power @xmath8 would then be compensated by the heating of the system with heat capacity @xmath42 and the heat flow @xmath43 : @xmath44 where @xmath45 represents the ambient temperature and @xmath41 the temperature inside the electrolyte .",
    "if we assume @xmath8 to be constant , the corresponding differential equation : @xmath46 has the straightforward solution : @xmath47 here @xmath48 denotes the finally reached temperature difference and @xmath49 is the time constant of the heating up .",
    "a fit of equation  [ eq : t_dev ] to the experimental data is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk ] .",
    "it yields : @xmath50 = 9 @xmath5 0.2 k. this translates to an overall heat - flux @xmath51 of 60mw per k temperature difference . a comparison of this result with the values of @xmath9 calculated in sec .",
    "[ ch : setup ] shows that about 50% of the heat flux takes place through the top and the bottom plate of the cell .",
    "the heat flux through the side walls , the electrodes and the plate area beyond the electrodes accounts for the rest .      in order to estimate the influence of the temperature gradients on the concentration driven convection currents , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_t ] the difference between @xmath21 and a ) the cathodic temperature maximum and b ) the anode .",
    "these temperature gradients result in a down - flow at the anode and an up - flow at the growth front , so they act as an additional driving .    for a more quantitative determination of their contribution ,",
    "the temperature dependency of the density was measured for different concentrations .",
    "the applied density measurement instrument dma 5000 from anton paar has an accuracy better than 50@xmath4g/@xmath1 .",
    "after 400s the temperature of the 0.1 m @xmath6 bulk solution has reached about 30@xmath52c which corresponds to a density of 1012.3 mg/@xmath1 . in accordance with the measurements presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and the theory in ref .",
    "@xcite , we estimate @xmath33 at the anode for that time as 0.25 m .",
    "this corresponds to a density of 1036.4mg/@xmath1 for @xmath41 = 30@xmath52c and 1037.4mg/@xmath1 for the actually measured @xmath53 27@xmath52c .",
    "so the contribution of the temperature gradient to the overall density difference at the anode is about 4% as visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_diff ] .    at the cathode @xmath33 has reached zero at that time , @xmath26 of @xmath7 is 995.68mg/@xmath1 for @xmath41 = @xmath54c and 995.38mg/@xmath1 for the @xmath41 = @xmath55c at the maximum .",
    "this results in a 2% contribution of the temperature gradient to the total density contrast .    as our applied potential is above average for standard electrodeposition experiments ,",
    "we conclude that temperature inhomogeneities will only weakly contribute to the density driven convection rolls .",
    "this result justifies with hindsight the use of the theoretical description of chazalviel et al.@xcite .",
    "finally it should be remarked that morphologies like stringy @xcite , where the zone of active growth is restricted to few small spots with very high local current densities , may differ substantially from our results .",
    "we want to thank jrgen fiebig from infratec for his friendly support .",
    "we are also grateful to niels hoppe and gerrit schnfelder from imos , universitt magdeburg for their assistance with the density measurements .",
    "this work was supported by the _",
    "deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft _ under the project for 301/2 - 1 .",
    "cooperation was facilitated by the tmr research network fmrx - ct96 - 0085 : patterns , noise & chaos .",
    "the standard enthalpy of formation @xmath56 of @xmath28 ions in an infinitely diluted solutions is @xmath57kj / mol @xcite .",
    "it contains three different contributions : 1 ) the energy necessary to liberate an atom from the surrounding lattice , 2 ) the energy needed to ionize the atom and 3 ) the hydration energy , which is set free when the water dipoles surround the ion .",
    "only the last term depends on the concentration of the solution , decreasing with the number of ions already dissolved .",
    "as the reaction rate at the electrodes is directly proportional to the electrical current @xmath58 , so is the chemical power @xmath59 : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the faraday constant ( 96485as / mol ) and @xmath62 the charge number . for zinc",
    "we derive @xmath63 = -0.8mw / ma . in the vicinity of the anode",
    "this number leads to additional heating due to the transformation of chemical energy . at the cathode the chemical energy stored in the newly produced zinc has to be subtracted from the overall heat production , but does not lead to a direct cooling of the cathode .      at the cathode the ion concentration drops fast to zero , which justifies the approximation of an infinitely diluted solution . at the anode",
    "the ion concentration increases during the whole run of the experiment . therefore the hydration energy of the newly produced @xmath28 ions decreases and in consequence the heat , which is released from the chemical reaction decrease as well .",
    "so the overall heat production from chemical energy at the anode is smaller than estimated here and therefore mostly irrelevant for the energy balance .",
    "this conclusion agrees with the fact that the anode is the coldest point of the cell as clearly shown in fig  [ fig : t_dev_a ] , in spite of this extra heat production there ."
