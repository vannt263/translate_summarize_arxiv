    "the problem of obtaining a real parametrization of a rational planar curve given by a complex parametrization has been studied from an algorithmic point of view in @xcite . there ,",
    "the problem is reduced to determining that a certain curve obtained after manipulating the given parametrization is a real line or a real circle . from a real parametrization of this circle ( or line ) , a real parametrization of the original curve is then achieved .",
    "this auxiliary circle is found by an analogous to weil descente s method @xcite applied to the complex parametrization of the originally given curve . in @xcite ,",
    "the same approach has been extended to the general case of planar or spatial rational curves @xmath5 given by a parametrization over @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an algebraic element over @xmath4 . in order to obtain , whenever possible , a parametrization over @xmath4 of @xmath5 , another rational curve , with remarkable properties , is associated to @xmath5 . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that this associated curve is , in the relevant cases , a generalization of a circle , in the sense we will discuss below , deserving to be named hypercircle .",
    "the simplest hypercircles should be the circles themselves .",
    "we can think of the real plane as the field of complex numbers @xmath8 , an algebraic extension of the reals @xmath9 of degree 2 .",
    "analogously , we can consider a characteristic zero base field @xmath4 and an algebraic extension of degree @xmath1 , @xmath6 .",
    "let us identify @xmath6 as the vector space @xmath10 , via the choice of a suitable base , such as the one given by the powers of @xmath7 .",
    "this is the framework in which hypercircles are defined .",
    "now let us look to the different , equivalent , ways of defining a common circle on the real plane , with the purpose of taking the most convenient one for generalization .",
    "the first definition of a circle is the set of points in the real plane that are equidistant from a fixed point .",
    "this approach does not extend well to more general algebraic extensions , because we do not have an immediate notion of metric over @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , algebraically , a real planar circle is a conic such that its homogeneous degree two form is @xmath11 and such that it contains an infinite number of real points .",
    "even if we will prove in section 6 that we can show an analogous definition for a hypercircle , this is not an operative way to start defining them .",
    "finally , from another point of view , we see that circles are real rational curves .",
    "this means that there are two real rational functions @xmath12 whose image cover almost all the points of the circle . for instance , the circle @xmath13 is parametrized by @xmath14 .",
    "every proper ( almost one - to - one @xcite ) rational parametrization of a circle verifies that @xmath15 , which defines a conformal mapping @xmath16 . moreover , if we identify @xmath8 with @xmath17 , the image of the real axis @xmath18 under @xmath19 is exactly the circle parametrized by @xmath20 .",
    "conversely , let @xmath21 be a unit of the near - ring @xmath22 under the composition operator ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath23 and @xmath24 then , the closure of the image by @xmath19 of the real axis is a circle .",
    "otherwise , it is a line .",
    "this method to construct circles generalizes easily to algebraic extensions .",
    "namely , let @xmath25 be a unit of @xmath26 ( i.e. verifying that @xmath27 ) .",
    "let us identify @xmath6 with @xmath10 and let @xmath19 be the map @xmath28 then , the zariski - closure of the image of the axis @xmath29 under the map @xmath19 is a rational curve in @xmath10 .",
    "these curves are , by definition , our hypercircles .",
    "roughly speaking , it happens ( see @xcite ) that a parametrization over @xmath4 of the hypercircle associated to a given rational curve @xmath5 ( whose parametrization we want to simplify ) can be used to get in a straightforward manner a parametrization of @xmath5 over @xmath4 .",
    "as pointed in @xcite , it seems that , due to the geometric properties of hypercircles , it is algorithmically simpler to obtain such parametrization for this type of curves than it is for @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , it is shown in @xcite how to get this in some cases .",
    "therefore , the reparametrization problem is behind our increasing interest in the study of hypercircles on its own .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we formally introduce the notion of hypercircle .",
    "we study the influence on a hypercircle when adding and multiplying the defining unit @xmath31 by elements of @xmath6 , reducing the affine classification of hypercircles to those defined by some simpler units .",
    "next we characterize the units associated to lines . in section 3",
    "we show how to transform , projectively , a hypercircle into the _ rational normal curve _ ( see @xcite ) . from this , we derive the main geometric properties of hypercircles ( smoothness , degree , affine equivalence , etc . ) and we reduce the study of hypercircles to the subclass of _ primitive hypercircles _ ( see definition [ def_hipercirculo_primitivo ] ) . in section 4 the behavior of hypercircles at infinity is analyzed , showing its precise and rich structure . in section 5 , exploiting the stated geometric features , we present _ ad hoc _ parametrization and implicitization methods for hypercircles",
    ". in section 6 we characterize hypercircles among curves of degree equal to the dimension of the ambient affine space , passing through the prescribed points of infinity described in section 4 and having infinitely many rational points .",
    "finally , section 7 is devoted to show how the insight gained throughout this paper can be applied to derive heuristics for solving the problem of simplifying the parametrization of curves with coefficients involving algebraic elements .    throughout this paper",

    "remark that a parametric curve , definable over @xmath4 and with a regular point over @xmath4 , is parametrizable over the same field ; for this , it is enough to @xmath4-birationally project the curve over a plane , such that the @xmath4-regular point stays regular on the projection , and then apply the results in @xcite .",
    "then , a small modification of the proof above , yields the following :    [ teorema - caracterizacion - dos ] let @xmath556 be a 1-dimensional irreducible algebraic set of degree @xmath1 , definable over @xmath4 .",
    "then , it is a primitive @xmath7-hypercircle if and only if it has a regular point with coordinates in @xmath4 and passes through the set of points at infinity characterized in theorem [ teo - infinito ] .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , hypercircles play an important role in the problem of the optimal - algebraic reparametrization of a rational curve ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite for further details )",
    ". roughly speaking , the problem is as follows . given a rational @xmath4definable curve @xmath30 by means of a proper rational parametrization over @xmath6 , decide whether @xmath30 can be parametrized over @xmath4 and , in the affirmative case , find a change of parameter transforming the original parametrization into a parametrization over @xmath4 . in @xcite , a @xmath4definable algebraic variety in @xmath581 , where @xmath582 $ ] , is associated to @xmath30 .",
    "this variety is called the associated weil ( descente ) parametric variety . in @xcite",
    ", it is proved that this weil variety has exactly one one - dimensional component iff @xmath5 is @xmath4definable ( which is our case ) and , in this case , @xmath5 can be parametrized over @xmath4 iff this one - dimensional component is a hypercircle .",
    "moreover , if it is a hypercircle a proper rational parametrization over @xmath4 of the hypercircle generates the change of parameter one is looking for ; namely its generating unit .    in the following example , we illustrate how to use the knowledge of the geometry of hypercircles to help solving the problem .",
    "suppose given the parametric curve @xmath583 @xmath584 where @xmath7 is algebraic over @xmath585 with minimal polynomial @xmath586 .",
    "we follow weil s descente method presented in @xcite to associate a hypercircle to @xmath5 .",
    "the method consists in writing @xmath587 .",
    "in this situation @xmath5 is @xmath588definable if and only if @xmath589 is of dimension 1 .",
    "moreover , @xmath5 is @xmath585-parametrizable if and only if the one - dimensional component of @xmath299 is an @xmath7-hypercircle .",
    "for this example , the equations of @xmath299 are : + @xmath590    thus the main point is to verify that this curve is a hypercircle",
    ". if @xmath299 is a hypercircle , then its points at infinity must be as in theorem 6.1 .",
    "so , let us first of all check whether this is the case .",
    "the set of generators of the defining ideal form a grbner basis with respect to a graded order , thus to compute the points at infinity we take the set of leading forms of these polynomials .",
    "the solutions of this system , after dehomogenizing @xmath592 , are @xmath593 .",
    "that is , the points at infinity are of the form @xmath594 $ ] , @xmath595 .",
    "thus , by proposition [ prop - puntos - infinito - directo ] , the points at infinity of @xmath299 remind those of an @xmath7-hypercircle .",
    "now , following proposition [ prop - parametrizacion ] , we may try to parametrize @xmath299 by the pencil of hyperplanes @xmath596 .",
    "doing so , we obtain the parametrization @xmath597 remark that this parametrization can also be computed by means of inverse computation techniques as described in @xcite .",
    "then , by direct computation , we observe that the parametric irreducible curve defined by this parametrization is of degree 3 , passes through the point @xmath598 and this point is regular .",
    "moreover , it is @xmath585-definable , since it is the only 1-dimensional component of @xmath299 ( see @xcite ) , which is , by construction , a @xmath585-definable variety .",
    "it follows from [ teorema - caracterizacion - dos ] that it is a hypercircle .",
    "then , from this parametrization , the algorithm presented in @xcite computes a unit @xmath599 associated to @xmath299 .",
