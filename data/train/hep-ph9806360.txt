    "the remarkable experimental success of the standard model ( sm ) suggests the possibility that at the weak scale there may be no other dynamics or particle content . on the other hand ,",
    "several questions remain unanswered within the sm framework and may require new dynamics in order to be addressed .",
    "among these questions are the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking and of fermion masses . in principle",
    ", it could be argued that the energy scales of the new dynamics related to these questions may be so large as to be irrelevant to observables at the weak scale .",
    "however , it is known that the physics behind the higgs sector and responsible for the breaking of the electroweak symmetry , can not reside at scales much higher than a few tev .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that the origin of the top quark mass might be related to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "thus , at least in some cases , the dynamics associated with new physics may not reside at arbitrarily high energies and there might be observable effects at lower energies . in cases where",
    "the underlying dynamics is not known or fully understood , the study of these non - decoupling effects is the realm of effective field theory .",
    "the non - decoupling effects of the higgs mechanism in the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsm ) sector of the sm have been vastly studied in the literature  @xcite . in order to write down the effective theory at energies well below the new physics scale @xmath5 , all states with masses above @xmath5 must be integrated out .",
    "the result is an effective field theory for the gauge bosons of the electroweak gauge group and the nambu - goldstone bosons ( ngb ) associated with the spontaneous breaking of @xmath6 down to @xmath7 .",
    "the effective theory at weak scale energies and below is in general non - renormalizable .",
    "however , it is possible to expand it in terms of the increasing dimension of the operators : the higher the dimension of the operator the higher the inverse power of @xmath5 suppressing its effects . up to a given order ( e.g. operators of dimension six , eight , etc . )",
    "it is possible to obtain a predictive effective theory .",
    "the effects of the physics above the scale @xmath5 are encoded in the values of the coefficients of the higher - dimension operators .",
    "we will concentrate on a scenario without scalars with masses below @xmath5 .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that the presence of a light scalar is usually either accompanied by other new particles with masses of the order of the weak scale ( e.g. supersymmetry ) or allows for the scale of new physics to be very large  @xcite , thereby resulting in suppressed effects .",
    "this scenario is most appropriately described by a higgs sector with non - linear transformation properties  @xcite . however , as we will see below , for the most part our results will be independent of this choice .",
    "we will stress the relevance of using the non - linear realization when necessary .",
    "important constraints on deviations from the sm through the coefficients of the effective lagrangian of the ewsb sector come from electroweak observables at the weak scale .",
    "for instance , non - standard contributions to two - point functions are severely constrained by oblique parameters as measured at the @xmath8-pole  @xcite .",
    "contributions to anomalous triple gauge - boson couplings ( tgc ) are bound by measurements of gauge boson production at lepii  @xcite and the tevatron  @xcite as well as by indirect measurements  @xcite , whereas anomalous quartic couplings give one - loop contributions to oblique parameters .",
    "finally , there is a set of operators in the ewsb sector that amounts to corrections to the ngb propagators and that result in four - fermion operators coupling to fermion masses .",
    "these are not bound at one - loop by oblique corrections , but by their contributions to vertices through top - quark loops  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in evaluating the sensitivity of fcnc decay processes at low energies , such as loop - induced @xmath4 and @xmath9 decays , to new dynamics in the ewsb sector residing above the scale @xmath5 .",
    "these processes , such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath10 , etc . , are affected in principle by all non - standard couplings of the gauge bosons and the ngb . in practice , since oblique corrections are directly probed with high precision at the @xmath8 pole , the corrections to two - point functions are already highly constrained and will give no effect when included in the one - loop processes named above .",
    "moreover , non - standard quartic gauge boson couplings do not enter in these decays to leading order .",
    "thus , we are left with two sources of deviations from the sm expectations in these modes : corrections to the ngb propagators and anomalous tgc . in ref .",
    "@xcite the sensitivity of rare @xmath4 and @xmath9 decays to the corrections to ngb propagators was studied .",
    "it was there concluded that within the constraints imposed on the effective lagrangian parameters by the measurements of @xmath11 , and @xmath4 and @xmath9 mixing large deviations from the sm were still possible in most fcnc decay modes , with the exception of @xmath0 and @xmath12 . in this paper , we want to evaluate the sensitivity of these decay modes to anomalous tgc originated , through the effective lagrangian , at energies above @xmath5 .",
    "the effects of anomalous tgc in rare @xmath4 decays have been previously studied in the literature . for instance , the effects of the dimension four anomalous @xmath13 coupling @xmath14 in @xmath0 transitions were first considered in  @xcite , whereas this plus the dimension six coupling @xmath15 where studied in  @xcite .",
    "these plus the corresponding cp violating couplings and their effects in the @xmath0 branching fractions were also considered in  @xcite .",
    "finally , the anomalous @xmath3 couplings and their effects in @xmath16 were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use the power counting of the non - linear realization of the ewsb sector to organize the anomalous tgc according to the dimension of the operator generating them in the effective theory .",
    "this will identify the relevant anomalous tgc in scenarios where the ewsb sector is strongly coupled .",
    "we will see that in these cases , fcnc transitions are very sensitive to one @xmath13 and one @xmath3 anomalous couplings , thus offering very well defined constraints on the strongly coupled ewsb sector that are competitive , for these couplings , to those obtained at higher energies . we also add the constraints from present and future measurements of rare kaon decays such as @xmath2 .",
    "previous studies of the effects of anomalous tgc couplings in rare @xmath9 decays were done for @xmath17 decays  @xcite , a mode largely affected by long distance contributions , and for @xmath2 by considering the effects of a parity violating anomalous tgc coupling  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the effects of the two relevant couplings and put the effects in the context of the a specific scenario for ewsb and with the effects in @xmath4 decays .",
    "we complete the analysis by considering the effects of cp violating tgc in rare @xmath4 decays , both in the rate as well as in cp asymmetries .",
    "the purpose of this work is to evaluate the sensitivity of future @xmath4 and @xmath9 experiments to anomalous tgc in the context of a strongly coupled ewsb sector .",
    "although model - independent in nature , this context results in a hierarchy of anomalous tgc related to the power counting in the resulting effective theory .",
    "a complete treatment of the effects of this scenario in rare @xmath4 and @xmath9 decays is lacking in the literature .",
    "this forms part of a program started in ref .",
    "@xcite , intended to explore the reach of sensitivity processes like the ones discussed here to a strongly coupled ewsb sector .",
    "it is possible that in a scenario like this one direct signals will not become available until the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) begins taking data .",
    "we also evaluate the competitiveness of these measurements with the direct measurements at higher energies to take place at the cern - lepii and the fermilab - tevatron colliders .",
    "we find these two approaches complementary largely due to the fact that the rare decay modes are selectively sensitive to a handful of anomalous tgc allowing independent measurements of these couplings . in the next section we review the non - linear realization of the effective lagrangian of the ewsb sector in relation to anomalous tgc . in section  3",
    "we compute the effects in rare @xmath4 and @xmath9 decays and we discuss the results and conclude in section  4 .",
    "in the absence of a light higgs boson the symmetry breaking sector is represented by a non - renormalizable effective lagrangian corresponding to the non - linear realization of the @xmath18 model .",
    "the essential feature is the spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry @xmath19 . to leading order the interactions involving the ngb associated with this mechanism and the gauge fields are described by @xmath20 + \\frac{v^2}{4}{\\rm tr}\\left[d_\\mu u^\\dagger d^\\mu u\\right ] , \\label{lo}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 $ ] are the the @xmath23 and @xmath24 field strengths respectively , the electroweak scale is @xmath25  gev and the ngb enter through the matrices @xmath26 .",
    "the covariant derivative acting on @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 . to this order",
    "there are no free parameters once the gauge bosons masses are fixed .",
    "the dependence on the dynamics underlying the strong symmetry breaking sector appears at next - to - leading order .",
    "a complete set of operators at next to leading order includes one operator of dimension two and operators of dimension four @xcite . the effective lagrangian to next to leading order is given by ( see the appendix for the expanded operator basis ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a dimension two custodial symmetry violating term absent in the heavy higgs limit of the sm .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to cp invariant structures , there remain fourteen operators of dimension four .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the coefficients of some of these operators are constrained by low energy observables .",
    "for instance precision electroweak observables bound the coefficient of @xmath30 , which gives a contribution to @xmath31 .",
    "the combinations @xmath32 and @xmath33 contribute to the oblique parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 , defined in  @xcite .",
    "corrections to the charged and neutral ngb propagators come from the operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "their effects in @xmath4 and @xmath9 fcnc processes were studied in ref .",

    "making contact with the electroweak lagrangian ( [ lnlo ] ) , these parameters can be expressed in terms of the next - to - leading order coefficients  @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the @xmath24 and @xmath23 gauge couplings respectively , and the operator basis is the one defined in  @xcite . as we see from the last line in ( [ contact ] ) , to this order in the energy expansion ( [ lnlo ] ) we obtain @xmath52 .",
    "these tgc get contributions from operators of dimension six , suppressed by an extra factor of @xmath53 .",
    "we are left with @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "finally , when considering rare @xmath4 and @xmath9 decays , we can neglect the contributions from @xmath55 since they will be suppressed by powers of the squared of the external momenta over @xmath58 .",
    "thus , in this approach , there are only three parameters relevant at very low energies .",
    "the sm predictions for them are @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the presence of the anomalous tgc @xmath14 , @xmath61 and @xmath57 will result in deviations from the sm in various fcnc @xmath4 and @xmath9 decays .",
    "we first concentrate on rare @xmath4 decays , with focus on strategies to make use of large data samples for the various modes .",
    "we then present the constraints from @xmath2 measurements , and finally study the possible effects of cp violating anomalous tgc .      for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 transitions it is useful to cast the contributions of the anomalous couplings as shifts in the matching conditions at @xmath62 for the wilson coefficient functions in the weak effective hamiltonian @xmath63 with the operator basis defined in ref .",
    "@xcite . of interest in our analysis",
    "are the electromagnetic penguin operator @xmath64 and the four - fermion operators corresponding to the vector and axial - vector couplings to leptons , @xmath65 and @xmath66    we first turn to the effects of @xmath14 in @xmath0 and @xmath1 transitions .",
    "this modification of the @xmath67 coupling gives a shift in the one - loop @xmath68 vertex , with @xmath69 . for @xmath70",
    "this is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the photon four - momentum , only the top quark contributions are kept and terms suppressed by @xmath73 have been neglected .",

    "the first term in ( [ bsgamma ] ) modifies @xmath82 and therefore contributes to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , whereas the second term only enters in the off - shell photon amplitude and gives a contribution to @xmath83 .",
    "the anomalous tgc diagrams containing the @xmath14 have the same divergent structure as the sm tgc contributions , and therefore the gim mechanism renders them finite by decreasing their degree of divergence by one , thus eliminating an initially a logarithmic divergence .    in order to compute the effects in @xmath4",
    "decays we evolve the wilson coefficients down to the scale @xmath84 using standard procedures  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the @xmath0 branching fraction as a function of @xmath14 . also shown for reference",
    "are the @xmath85 intervals from the latest measurements of the cleo collaboration  @xcite : @xmath86 , as well as from the aleph collaboration  @xcite : @xmath87 .",
    "combining these two results gives an approximate @xmath85 interval for @xmath14 @xmath88 .",
    "future measurements of the @xmath0 branching ratio will greatly improve these constraints . for instance , a @xmath89 measurement of the @xmath90 branching ratio would translate into the more stringent @xmath85 bound @xmath91 , if centered at the sm prediction .",
    "the dilepton modes @xmath1 receive contributions from @xmath14 through both @xmath92 and @xmath93 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the branching ratio @xmath94 , normalized by the sm value , is plotted versus @xmath14 .",
    "although the sensitivity of these decay channels is similar to the one obtained in @xmath0 , the bounds are somewhat less stringent .",
    "this is more so when we consider that , unlike in @xmath0 , other anomalous tgc may significantly affect this amplitude .",
    "however , we will later come back to this point to show that it is possible to cleanly separate the contributions from the various relevant couplings even if only @xmath1 decays are considered .",
    "the sensitivity of these rare @xmath4 decays to @xmath14 is certainly comparable to that of higher energy experiments such as lepii and the tevatron . for instance the @xmath95  c.l .",
    "limits from lepii  @xcite combining the data taken at @xmath96  gev and at @xmath97  gev ( @xmath98 at each energy ) are @xmath99 . on the other hand ,",
    "the most recent measurements at the fermilab tevatron  @xcite put this coupling in the range @xmath100 .",
    "the tevatron bounds depend on the scale of suppression introduced with the momentum dependence of the couplings , necessary to respect unitarity constraints .",
    "both the tevatron and the lep bounds are obtained within a certain set of assumptions .",
    "future lepii measurements at higher energies , as well as tevatron measurements with higher luminosity , will result in bounds similar to the ones that will be obtained from fcnc processes named above .",
    "we now turn to the effects of @xmath61 , an anomalous @xmath101 coupling .",
    "its presence affects the @xmath102 amplitude as well as the one of the neutrino modes @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the modes governed by @xmath105 are the most accessible experimentally among the @xmath4 processes . unlike the @xmath14 contribution , the diagrams including @xmath61 are still divergent , even after summing over all the intermediate up - quark states .",
    "this divergence originates in the contributions from the longitudinal pieces in the @xmath106 propagator and reflects the non - decoupling behavior of the higgs sector .",
    "this logarithmic dependence of the loop effect on the high energy scale @xmath5 is a manifestation of the dynamics above this scale , and is presumably related to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "thus , this logarithmic enhancement of the one - loop effect of @xmath61 is of a rather fundamental origin  @xcite and makes fcnc particularly sensitive to this anomalous coupling .",
    "the matching conditions for the wilson coefficients @xmath83 and @xmath107 are shifted by @xmath108 the function @xmath109 is given simply by the leading logarithmic dependence , @xmath110 in ( [ b1x ] ) , the dots stand for terms that are finite in the @xmath111 limit .",
    "these terms are regularization scheme dependent and , although formally subleading , could be numerically important . however , it is expected that the overall size of the effect is correctly estimated by the leading logarithmic behavior , barring precise cancellations with the finite terms .",
    "thus , the results we present for @xmath61 are meant to be indicative of the sensitivity to this coupling but not a precise prediction is common to both results .",
    "] , something that can not be achieved without knowledge of the full theory above the energy scale @xmath5 . the solid line in fig",
    ".  [ fig3 ] , shows the branching ratio for @xmath1 , normalized to the sm model prediction , as a function of @xmath61 , where the high energy scale scale in ( [ b1x ] ) is taken to be @xmath112tev .",
    "although at present only upper limits on @xmath1 processes exist  @xcite , sensitivity to the sm predictions is expected to be achieved in the next round of @xmath4 physics experiments .",
    "for instance , measurements of @xmath1 branching ratios with @xmath113 accuracy , can explore the region @xmath114 , a very competitive performance even when compared with the high energy machines .",
    "for instance , lepii is expected to just explore this region  @xcite , whereas the tevatron experiments , assuming an integrated luminosity of @xmath115 , will bound @xmath61 to be in the interval @xmath116",
    "the main difference between these measurements and the fcnc decay modes is that the latter have an additional dependence on @xmath5 from the logarithmic divergence .",
    "next , we study the effects of the @xmath117 and @xmath118 violating but @xmath42 conserving coupling @xmath57 .",
    "these are simply obtained by the replacement @xmath119 in eqns .",
    "( [ c9_b ] ) and  ( [ c10_b ] ) , where @xmath120 is given by @xmath121 unlike the contribution from @xmath61 , the resulting loop amplitude is finite , due to the fact that the @xmath122 tensor accompanying @xmath57 does not couple to the longitudinal portion of the @xmath106 propagators . as a result , the contributions from this parameter to one - loop fcnc processes are not sensitive to the scale @xmath5 .",
    "this , in turn , implies that in this case there is no logarithmic enhancement as in the case of the @xmath61 contribution and that these processes are not very sensitive to this coefficient , as can be seen from the dashed line in fig .",
    "this is in agreement with the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite .    from the above results ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath4 decay processes involving one - loop fcnc are most sensitive to two cp conserving anomalous tgc , namely @xmath14 and @xmath61 .",
    "as we will see below , the analogous @xmath9 decay modes have a similar sensitivity to @xmath61 .",
    "this is an important difference with the the high energy searches for these effects , where the experiments are sensitive to several parameters giving room to possible cancellations with the consequent weakening of the bounds .",
    "the limited sensitivity of the low energy fcnc transitions permits the clean identification of the anomalous tgc .",
    "the obvious example is the fact that @xmath0 is sensitive only to @xmath14 , among the cp conserving couplings .",
    "however , even when only considering @xmath1 , processes , where both @xmath14 and @xmath61 contribute , it is possible to separate their effects .",
    "this results from a very distinct pattern of shifts of the short distance wilson coefficients . as it can be seen in ( [ c9_b ] )",
    ", the shift in the coefficient @xmath83 will be negligible due to the suppression factor @xmath123 , whereas this is not the case for @xmath107 .",
    "this is reflected in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where we plot the forward - backward asymmetry for leptons in @xmath124 as a function of the dilepton mass .",
    "the asymmetry has a zero the position of which depends on the values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , but not on @xmath125  @xcite .",
    "thus , values of @xmath61 resulting in large deviations of the branching fractions in @xmath1 decays , do not change the position of the asymmetry zero . on the other hand ,",
    "non - zero values of @xmath14 affect both @xmath80 and @xmath81 shifting the position where the asymmetry vanishes . in this way the angular information makes possible the separation between @xmath14 and @xmath61 effects that otherwise could be unresolvable in the branching ratio or even in the dilepton mass distribution .",
    "effects similar to those discussed above for @xmath4 decays are present in the analogous @xmath9 processes , due to the one loop contributions to the @xmath126 and @xmath127 vertices .",
    "the photon mediated transitions , such as @xmath128 and hyperon radiative decays , are largely affected by long distance contributions which are theoretically uncertain and make difficult the extraction of interesting short distance information .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath129 transitions such as @xmath2 and @xmath130 are theoretically cleaner .",
    "there are two diagrams contributing to these processes , the box and the @xmath131 penguin .",
    "the latter is sensitive to @xmath61 and @xmath57 .",
    "the anomalous contribution to the @xmath129 amplitude can be written as @xmath132 with the functions @xmath109 and @xmath120 defined in ( [ b1x ] ) and ( [ b2x ] ) . as discussed in the previous section , only the effect of @xmath61 is sensitive to the logarithmic dependence on the high energy scale @xmath5 , due to its coupling to the longitudinal gauge bosons . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we plot the branching fraction for @xmath2 , normalized to the sm expectation , as a function of @xmath61 .",
    "we observe that this decay mode has a sensitivity to @xmath61 comparable to that of the @xmath1 decays .",

    "currently , this branching ratio is measured to be  @xcite @xmath133 , whereas the sm prediction is in the range @xmath134  @xcite .",
    "thus , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , there is room for relatively large values of @xmath61 in both @xmath4 and @xmath9 fcnc decays .      in this section we discuss the possible effects of cp violating tgc .",
    "the most general form of the cp violating couplings of a neutral gauge boson @xmath135 to a @xmath106 pair is @xmath136 with @xmath137 .",

    "they are negligibly small in the corresponding @xmath152 transitions , due to an extra factor of the cabibbo angle .",
    "thus , processes with strange mesons , such as @xmath153 , are free of sm sources of cp violation . for a partial rate asymmetry to arise ,",
    "it is necessary that a cp - invariant phase be present in the amplitude . in the case of @xmath152 transitions",

    "several thousand reconstructed events would be needed for a significant measurement .",

    ", we rely on the projections for various @xmath1 decay modes to be observed at @xmath4 experiments at the sm level . for instance",
    ", several hundred events in the @xmath168 channel will be available at the tevatron experiments in the incoming run .",
    "this will allow not only tight bounds from the effect in the rate ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) but also the clean separation of the @xmath61 coupling from possible effects from anomalous @xmath13 couplings by analyzing dilepton angular information .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry for leptons shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is an example of this separation : the position of the asymmetry zero is immune to @xmath61 , whereas it is very sensitive to changes in the @xmath13 couplings . on the other hand , it is possible to extract the short distance information from these exclusive modes by using a variety of techniques mostly related to heavy and light quark symmetry arguments , and with relatively small hadronic uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "the limits on @xmath61 can be further improved by future measurements of the @xmath2 branching fraction .",
    "this mode is as sensitive to the @xmath3 anomalous coupling as the @xmath1 modes , with the advantage that it is not polluted by the @xmath13 couplings .",

    "[ fig6 ] , the current @xmath85 bound from the @xmath0 branching ratio measurement is @xmath170 .",
    "thus , the range quoted in table  i is a rather conservative estimate of what can be achieved by the next generation measurements of this decay channel .",
    "it compares well with what can be obtained by direct measurements , for instance , through @xmath171 production at the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we have seen that the identification of an effect in the radiative channels as coming from a cp violating coupling would require measurements of cp asymmetries below @xmath172 .",
    "this can only be obtained with several thousand reconstructed events in channels such as @xmath153 , a goal that is beyond the first generation @xmath4 factories and perhaps to be attained by future dedicated @xmath4 experiments at hadron colliders , such as the lhc - b at cern or btev at the tevatron .",
    "we now briefly discuss the potential impact of these bounds on our understanding of the ewsb sector of the sm .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we focused on the non - linear realization of the ewsb sector , which is the appropriate description in the absence of scalars with masses below the cutoff @xmath5 . within this framework",
    "the anomalous tgc @xmath15 and @xmath173 vanish at next - to - leading order in the effective theory ( [ lnlo ] ) , since they correspond to operators that are suppressed by @xmath174 relative to the dimension four set @xmath175 .",
    "the only consequence this power counting has in the analysis of low energy signals such as fcnc @xmath4 and @xmath9 decays , is the vanishing of the @xmath15 contributions , since the @xmath173 effects are suppressed by the factor @xmath176 and are therefore negligible in any description of the ewsb sector .",
    "thus , as far as the anomalous @xmath3 couplings are concerned , the present analysis is valid in both the linear and non - linear realizations .",
    "the effects of the coupling @xmath61 in fcnc processes are enhanced by a logarithmic dependence on the high energy scale @xmath5 . in the effective field theory language this leading logarithm coexists with finite counterterms which are naturally of comparable size . as discussed in section  3 in relation to eqn .",
    "( [ b1x ] ) , the finite counterterms are model - dependent whereas the coefficient of the leading logarithm is determined at low energies independently of the specific theory above the scale @xmath5 .",
    "thus , although not the full answer , the logarithmic dependence provides us with the correct size of the effect , implying that the limits on @xmath61 should be considered rough estimates of the effects , designed to evaluate the sensitivity of a given experiment to this physics .",
    "furthermore , this logarithmically divergent behavior with the scale @xmath5 arises as a consequence of the contributions of longitudinal components of @xmath177 in the loops , and is a manifestation of the non - standard behavior of the ngb of the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "all other anomalous tgc give finite one - loop contributions to fcnc processes due to the gim mechanism and the fact that they only couple to the transverse piece of the gauge boson propagators .",
    "the gim cancellation ensures that the bounds obtained on @xmath14 and @xmath178 are more precise .",
    "therefore the bounds from rare @xmath4 and @xmath9 decays on @xmath61 will be less precise ( perhaps good up to factors of two or so ) , but is the coupling to which fcnc @xmath4 and @xmath9 decays are most sensitive and potentially the most interesting one .    with respect to the expected size of the effects",
    ", we emphasize that the present study is model - independent and that to compute the coefficients @xmath179 of the effective lagrangian ( [ lnlo ] ) knowledge of the full theory above the matching scale @xmath5 is needed .",
    "however , it is possible to apply dimensional arguments to these couplings .",
    "for instance , naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) @xcite suggests that @xmath180 with the scale of new physics obeying @xmath181 .",
    "however , in practice this power counting can only be applied to those coefficients that respect the custodial @xmath182 symmetry that ensures that @xmath183 is small compared to one . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this constraint implies that custodial breaking terms in @xmath184 should naturally be further suppressed by an extra factor of @xmath185 or so . in terms of the anomalous tgc",
    "this means that it is natural to expect that @xmath57 is no larger than @xmath186 on the other hand , @xmath14 and @xmath61 receive contributions from custodial conserving terms and then are expected to be in the @xmath187 range in these scenarios .",
    "a sizeable fraction of this range can be reached by fcnc processes , which are sensitive to anomalous tgc as small as a few percent . for the coefficient",
    "@xmath61 this is true even in the first generation of @xmath4 factory experiments and for @xmath188 measurements of the @xmath2 branching ratio .",
    "for both the cp conserving @xmath14 and cp violating @xmath142 @xmath13 anomalous couplings , a few percent precision will only be achieved with at least one order of magnitude more reconstructed events , to be available at the proposed lhc - b and btev experiments .",
