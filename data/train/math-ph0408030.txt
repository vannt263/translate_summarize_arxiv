    "coherent states ( cs ) were introduced by schroedinger in 1926 @xcite while he was studying the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator system .",
    "the same mathematical objects , the coherent states , were also studied by glauber @xcite and by klauder @xcite four decades ago .",
    "glauber found them while he was studying the electromagnetic correlation function @xcite .",
    "he also realized that these states have the interesting property of minimizing the uncertainty heisenberg relation .",
    "thus , one could say that these states are the quantum states with the closest behavior to a classical system .",
    "cs have applications in many areas of physics @xcite and since the birth of these states there has always been some interest in investigating their algebraic properties @xcite .",
    "we point out that there is not a unique way to construct coherent states .",
    "in fact , there are different approaches leading to them , for instance , the well known klauder @xcite and perelomov - gilmore approaches @xcite .",
    "in the first approach the coherent states are constructed using the basis of the fock representation of the harmonic oscillator algebra , while in the second one this construction is based on notions of group theory .    in our work",
    ", we deal with klauder s approach which is based on the construction of coherent states of the heisenberg algebra .",
    "this algebra appears in many areas of modern theoretical physics and as an example we notice that the one - dimensional quantum oscillator algebra is an important tool in the second quantization approach .    due to the relevance of heisenberg algebra , during the last two decades",
    "some effort has been devoted to study possible deformations of the harmonic oscillator algebra @xcite . along these years several groups have also generalized the heisenberg algebra ( see for instance @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "all these generalized heisenberg algebras ( gha ) are related among them . in this paper",
    "we will use the gha given in @xcite just because in this version of the algebra , the hamiltonian of the physical system under consideration belongs explicitly to the set of generators of the algebra , the other generators in this set being the step operators of the system .",

    "this class is characterized by those quantum systems having energy eigenvalues written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are successive energy levels and @xmath0 is a different function for each physical system .    in this paper , motivated by the procedure for constructing the standard coherent states of the harmonic oscillator",
