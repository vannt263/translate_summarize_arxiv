    "irregular dwarf galaxy , the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is often considered as a local analog of primordial galaxies at high redshifts which must have formed at very low metallicity . therefore , the dust in the smc which differs substantially from that in the milky way ( see li & draine 2002 ) allows us to probe the primordial conditions in more distant galaxies .",
    "the smc extinction curve displays a nearly linear rise with inverse wavelength and no detectable 2175@xmath0 extinction bump ( lequeux et al .",
    "1982 ; cartledge et al .  2005 ) , presumably due to the destruction of the carriers of the 2175  hump by the intense ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation and shocks associated with star formation [ an exception to this is the line of sight toward sk 143 ( avz 456 ) for which the extinction curve has a strong 2175  hump ( lequeux et al .  1982 ; cartledge et al .  2005 ) .",
    "this sightline passes through the smc wing , a region with much weaker star formation ( gordon & clayton 1998 ) ] .",
    "although the precise nature of the carriers of the 2175  hump remains unclear , it is generally believed to be due to the @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6 transition of small aromatic carbonaceous ( i.e. graphitic ) grains , probably a cosmic mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules ( li & draine 2001 ) .",

    "2000 , li & draine 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the absence of the 2175@xmath0 extinction bump and the very weak 12@xmath2 emission in the smc imply the lack of pahs in the smc .",

    "a natural question one may ask is : are their large - size counterparts  carbon dust ( either graphite or amorphous carbon ) with radii larger than @xmath1100@xmath0  also deficient in the smc and low - metallicity galaxies , or more generally , what are the dust grains in the smc ( or metal - poor galaxies ) made of ?    our knowledge about the smc dust is mainly derived from the extinction curve . as early as 1983 when the @xmath139@xmath8 uv extinction data",
    "were just available for the smc thanks to the iue satellite , bromage & nandy ( 1983 ) had already recognized `` the conspicuous _ absence _ of normal _ graphite _ grains in the smc '' .",

    "pei ( 1992 ) even attributed the smc extinction exclusively to silicates alone .",
    "however , based on an analysis of the hst / stis interstellar absorption spectra of the smc components , welty et al .",
    "( 2001 ) recently reported that the si and mg elements in the interstellar cloud toward sk155 in the smc appear to be essentially _ undepleted _ , imposing a serious _ challenge _ on all dust models for the smc since they all require a substantial amount of silicates to account for the observed extinction .",
    "it is the purpose of this _ letter _ to examine the _ unusual _ depletions observed in the smc sightline toward sk155 . to this end",
    ", we investigate whether the depleted elements are sufficient to account for the observed extinction .",
    "our approach , as described in ",
    "[ sec : kk ] , is based on the kramers - kronig ( kk ) dispersion relation ( purcell 1969 ) and is independent of any specific dust models .",
    "in 19261927 , h.a . kramers and r. kronig independently demonstrated that the real ( dispersive ) and imaginary ( absorptive ) parts of the index of refraction are not independent , but are related to each other through a relation which is now known as the kramers - kronig ( kk ) dispersion relation . applying this relation to the ism , purcell ( 1969 )",
    "related the interstellar extinction integrated over wavelength to the total volume of grains in the ism : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the extinction optical depth at wavelength @xmath7 , @xmath11 is the h column density , @xmath12 is the total volume occupied by dust per h nucleon , and the dimensionless factor @xmath13 is the orientationally - averaged polarizability relative to the polarizability of an equal - volume conducting sphere , which depends only upon the grain shape and the static ( zero - frequency ) dielectric constant @xmath14 of the grain material ( purcell 1969 ) . for amorphous olivine ( draine & lee 1984 ) , @xmath15 for mgo ( roessler & huffman 1998 ) , @xmath16 for feo , @xmath17 for fe@xmath18o@xmath19 ( steyer 1974 ) , @xmath20 for fe@xmath19o@xmath21 ( landolt & brnstein tables ) , and @xmath22 for amorphous carbon ( j. robertson 2005 , private communication ) . ]    very recently",
    ", we have applied this relation to examine whether porous dust could solve the so - called interstellar subsolar abundance `` crisis '' ( li 2005 ) .",
    "similarly , this approach can be applied to the unusual depletions seen along the sk155 sightline : if si and mg are indeed undepleted , would there be enough raw material to form the dust to account for the extinction observed for the smc ?    to make an economical use of the heavy elements , we consider fluffy dust with a `` fluffiness '' or `` porosity '' of @xmath23 ( i.e. the volume fraction of vacuum contained in a grain ) .",
    "assuming that all heavy elements depleted from the gas phase have been locked up in dust which consists of @xmath24 grain species , the _ maximum _ volume of dust per h nucleon can be estimated from @xmath12=@xmath25_{\\rm tot}}}-{{\\small \\left[{\\rm x / h}\\right]_{\\rm gas}}}\\right )   \\mu_{\\rm x}/\\left(1-p\\right ) \\rho_j$ ] , where @xmath26_{\\rm tot}}}$ ] and @xmath26_{\\rm gas}}}$ ] are respectively the total and gas abundance of element x relative to h ( the amount of x contained in dust is therefore @xmath26_{\\rm dust}}}$]=@xmath26_{\\rm tot}}}-{{\\small \\left[{\\rm x / h}\\right]_{\\rm gas}}}$ ] ) ; @xmath27 is the atomic weight of x ; @xmath28 is the mass density of dust species @xmath29 ( we take @xmath30=3.5 , 3.58 , 5.7 , 5.25 , 5.18 , 1.8 , and 7.85@xmath31 for amorphous olivine mgfesio@xmath21 , mgo , feo , fe@xmath18o@xmath19 , fe@xmath19o@xmath21 , amorphous carbon , and pure iron grains , respectively ) ; and @xmath32 is the fraction of element x locked up in dust species @xmath29 .",

    "below we examine the 2 possible grain models implied from the anomalous depletions suggested by welty et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "\\(1 ) _ metallic grains _ ?",
    " welty et al .  ( 2001 ) suggested that metallic grains or iron oxides may dominate the dust populations in the smc sightline toward sk155 since they thought that si and mg are essentially undepleted while fe is severely depleted .",
    "if we take the abundances of heavy elements to be those of solar ( asplund , grevesse , & sauval 2005 ) scaled by the abundance of zn ( @xmath53^{\\rm sk\\,155}_{\\rm tot}}}\\approx 0.004$]ppm ; welty et al .",
    "2001 ) which is considered typically undepleted , the total iron abundance is @xmath54^{\\rm sk\\,155}_{\\rm tot}}}= { { \\small \\left[{\\rm zn / h}\\right]^{\\rm sk\\,155}_{\\rm tot}}}{{\\small",
    "\\left[{\\rm fe / h}\\right]_{\\odot}}}/{{\\small \\left[{\\rm zn / h}\\right]_{\\odot}}}\\approx 2.5{\\,{\\rm ppm}}$ ] . for compact metallic iron grains ( @xmath55 )",
    ", this implies @xmath56 . in order to have @xmath57 ,",
    "these grains need to be highly elongated : with an elongation of at least @xmath125 for prolates and @xmath184 for oblates ( see fig.3 of li 2003b ) .",
    "however , these needle - like iron grains would produce an extinction curve very different from that observed for the smc since their extinction cross sections are essentially constant at wavelengths shorter than the long - wavelength cutoff and beyond which they decline as @xmath58 ( see eqs.[3 - 5 ] of li 2003a ) .",
    "therefore , metallic iron grains are unlikely the dominant dust component in the smc .",
    "\\(2 ) _ iron oxides _ ?  assuming that all 2.5@xmath59 fe ( relative to h ) are evenly tied up in feo , fe@xmath18o@xmath19 , and fe@xmath19o@xmath21 , porous grains consisting of feo , fe@xmath18o@xmath19 , and fe@xmath19o@xmath21 would have @xmath60 .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ fig : iron]a , the @xmath52 values predicted for the porous iron oxide dust are much smaller than @xmath51 even for grains with an elongation as large as 15 . therefore , iron oxides are unlikely the dominant dust components in the smc . further more ,",
    "even if we assume that ( 1 ) there is another major dust species  amorphous carbon , extinction bump which is not commonly seen in the smc . ]",
    "( 2 ) the total c abundance is that of solar scaled by the abundance of zn ( i.e. @xmath61^{\\rm sk\\,155}_{\\rm tot}}}= { { \\small \\left[{\\rm zn / h}\\right]^{\\rm sk\\,155}_{\\rm tot}}}{{\\small \\left[{\\rm c / h}\\right]_{\\odot}}}/{{\\small \\left[{\\rm zn / h}\\right]_{\\odot}}}\\approx 24.5{\\,{\\rm ppm}}$ ] ) , and ( 3 ) _ all _ c atoms are tied up in amorphous carbon grains , the model - predicted @xmath52 values are still much smaller than the lower - limit of @xmath62 ( see fig.[fig : iron]b ) .",
    "therefore , the extinction observed for the sk155 sightline is unlikely produced by a mixture of iron oxides and amorphous carbon .",
    "the anomalous depletions in the smc sightline toward sk155 was derived by comparing the relative abundances [ x / zn ] in the smc with the corresponding patterns seen in the galactic ism , and assuming the relative total abundances of the smc are not very different from those of solar ( welty et al .",
    "vladilo ( 2002 ) argued that the smc abundances may deviate from the solar ratios .",
    "sofia et al .",
    "( 2006 ) argued that zn is not a suitable reference for comparison since zn is modestly depleted in the milky way ism ; they further suggested that s may be a better comparison species since ( 1 ) s is essentially undepleted , and ( 2 ) both si and s are formed through the same process ( i.e. oxygen burning ) .",
    "with s as the comparison species and adopting the solar abundances but scaled by the sk155 s abundance ( @xmath63^{\\rm sk\\,155}_{\\rm tot}}}\\approx 2.4{\\,{\\rm ppm}}$ ] , welty et al .",
    "2001 ) , we find that the available heavy elements are not sufficient to account for the observed extinction",
    ". one may argue that it is more appropriate to use the smc abundances ( russell & dopita 1992 ; hereafter rd92 ) as a reference rather than those of solar ( i.e. assuming the abundances for the sk155 sightline to be those of the smc scaled by s ) . in this case , the total abundances ( relative to h ) of the key dust - forming elements would be @xmath64 . subtracting the gas - phase abundances of @xmath65 of sk155 ( welty et al .",
    "2001 ) , the abundances available for depletion are @xmath66 .",
    "we assume that all the dust - phase si atoms are incorporated into amorphous olivine mgfesio@xmath21 .",
    "this will also consume 1.8@xmath59 mg and fe .",
    "we take the remaining 1.1@xmath59 mg to be depleted in mgo , and the remaining 2.1@xmath59 fe evenly tied up in feo , fe@xmath18o@xmath19 , and fe@xmath19o@xmath21 .",
    "we also assume that _ all _ the 33@xmath59 c are bound up in amorphous carbon .",
    "in so doing , we obtain @xmath67 . however , as shown in figure [ fig : s]a , the model - predicted @xmath52 values never exceed @xmath51 even for grains with rather large elongations . therefore , the total abundances for sk155 are unlikely just the rd92 smc abundances scaled by s. if we simply adopt the rd92 smc abundances as the total abundances for the sk155 sightline ( i.e. without scaling down the smc abundances ) , the dust - phase abundances would be @xmath68 after subtracting the gas - phase abundances of welty et al .",
    "this depletion pattern roughly points to a composition of olivine silicates .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : s]b , the @xmath52 values calculated from these silicate grains are still smaller than the observational lower boundary of @xmath69 even for grains with an elongation as large as 15.20% for @xmath70 , silicate grains ( together with oxides and/or amorphous carbon ) with large elongations can account for the observed extinction ( see figs.2a , b ) , but oxides ( even together with amorphous carbon ) are unable to do it ( see figs.1a , b ) .",
    "] this suggests that either the actual abundances for the heavy elements mg , si and fe toward sk155 are higher than those of rd92 , or alternatively , there must exist another dust component ( e.g. amorphous carbon ) which makes a considerable contribution to the extinction . for the latter case , with the addition of an amorphous carbon component which takes 2/3 of the total smc c abundance ( like the milky way diffuse ism in which about 2/3 of the total c are depleted to form carbon dust ; see li 2005 )",
    ", the model - predicted @xmath52 values exceed @xmath71 for grains of any shape and of a wide range of porosities ( see fig.[fig : si]a ) .",
    "this implies that grain models consisting of a mixture of silicate and carbon dust are capable of accounting for the smc extinction .",
    "the calculations discussed above all put a substantial fraction of si and mg in gas , as found for the sk155 sightline by welty et al .",
    "existing models for the smc dust all assume a nearly complete depletion of si , mg and fe into silicates .",
    "as shown in figure[fig : si]b , the @xmath52 values calculated from silicates consuming all of the si , mg , and fe elements ( i.e. no gas - phase si , mg and fe ) of the rd92 smc abundances exceed @xmath72 for grains with modest elongations and a wide range of porosities ( the sk155 dust is expected to be elongated since an appreciable amount of polarization has been detected along the sk155 sightline ; see wayte 1990).b shows that with the rd92 smc abundances , _ compact spherical _ silicate grains are not able to account for the smc extinction .",
    "the reason why pei ( 1992 ) could fit the smc extinction curve using such grains was because he adopted a higher si abundance ( higher than the rd92 smc abundance by @xmath130% ) . in the weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) model for the smc ,",
    "the extinction is also dominantly contributed by compact spherical silicate grains .",
    "this was also because they took a si abundance @xmath137% higher than that of rd92 . ] on the other hand , even if we assume that all the c elements are locked up in amorphous carbon , they alone are not able to account for the extinction since the model - predicted @xmath52 values are always smaller than @xmath67 , suggesting that carbon dust can not be the dominant grain component in sk155 .",
    "by comparing the abundances of heavy elements relative to zn in the smc with the corresponding patterns seen in the galactic ism , and assuming the relative total abundances of the smc are not very different from those of solar , welty et al .",
    "( 2001 ) derived the undepletion of si and mg and mild to severe depletions of fe for the smc star sk155 .",
    "they further suggested that iron oxides and/or metallic grains , instead of silicates , may dominate the smc dust , in marked contrast with current dust models for the smc which all rely heavily on silicates .",
    "based on the kramers - kronig relation , we study these anomalous depletions and their implications for our understanding of the smc dust .",
    "it is found that neither iron oxides nor metallic grains ( even with the addition of an amorphous carbon dust component ) can account for the observed extinction . if using s as a reference and scaling either the solar abundances or the smc abundances , the resulting abundances of the condensible elements are also insufficient to explain the observed extinction .",
    "however , we are able to account for the smc extinction if adopting the smc abundances and assuming all si , mg and fe elements are locked up in silicates or a combination of a partial depletion of these elements in silicates and a partial depletion of c in amorphous carbon . in both cases , silicates are a major contributor to the smc extinction .",
