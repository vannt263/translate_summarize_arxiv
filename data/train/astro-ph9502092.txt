    "current constraints , from a comparison of standard , homogeneous , primordial nucleosynthesis calculations with light - element abundances by walker ( 1991 , see also olive 1990 and peebles 1991 ) , place tight limits on the baryon density parameter of the universe , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this implies a mean baryon density of about @xmath7 per cent of the critical closure density if @xmath8 , which is much lower than the previous upper limit of @xmath9 determined by yang ( 1984 ) . as first pointed out by s.  white & frenk ( 1991 ) , the recent calculation of the mean baryon fraction conflicts with the x - ray determinations of the gas fraction of mass in clusters if @xmath1 .",
    "this fraction should equal @xmath10 if dark matter is distributed similarly to the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "they , and more recently s.  white ( 1993 ) , noted that hot gas contributes approximately 20 per cent to the total mass of the coma cluster within approximately @xmath0 , indicating that @xmath11 .",
    "baryon fraction estimates for the coma cluster have been extended to @xmath12 , utilizing the ` unlimited ' field of view of the all - sky survey ( briel , henry , & bhringer 1992 ) , where the gas mass content is then 30 per cent .",
    "thus at face value , either @xmath13 , dark matter and baryons have different distributions on cluster scales , or the abundance measurements and/or calculations of @xmath14 are incorrect .",
    "this last possibility is unlikely since it involves the best - understood physics .",
    "over a decade ago , ku ( 1983 ) determined that the baryon fraction within @xmath15 of ca@xmath16 was greater than 10 per cent , while stewart ( 1984 ) found variations between 3 and 20 per cent within the central @xmath17 of 36 clusters , and that a significant number of clusters have baryon fractions of at least 10 per cent .",
    "stewart also noted that the baryon fraction increase with radius , a result supported by the analysis of data by forman & jones ( 1984 ) which showed that the scale - height of the gas distribution in clusters is generally larger than that of the gravitational mass .",
    "edge & stewart ( 1991b ) also determined baryon fractions of up to 20 per cent from observations of 36 clusters of galaxies .",
    "however , none of these studies noted any conflict between the x - ray determinations of the baryon fraction and the constraints from standard primordial nucleosynthesis ; the calculated limit of the baryon fraction at that time was @xmath9 .",
    "a recent study of the shapley supercluster by fabian ( 1991 ) , where gas mass and luminosity relations from forman & jones ( 1984 ) are extrapolated , indicates that the baryon fraction there is greater than 18 per cent over a region of @xmath18 in radius .",
    "this over - density of a factor of 3 implies that the baryons must have been accumulated from a region that is at least 40 per cent larger in radius , if @xmath1 .",
    "this then implies that the shapley region must be bound , or has at least retarded the hubble flow over this region , and creates problems for the theory of the formation of large - scale structure in currently favoured models .",
    "if baryon over - densities are common in clusters , as we aim to show in this paper , then perhaps the most obvious solution is that @xmath19 ( for baryon fractions of 30 per cent @xmath20  see also s.  white & frenk 1991 , and s.white 1993 ) . however , this solution disagrees with the strong evidence for @xmath1 from cluster evolution and substructure studies ( richstone , loeb & turner 1992 ) , and the estimates obtained from the potent analysis of galaxy density fields and peculiar velocities ( nusser & dekel 1993 , dekel 1993 , dekel & rees 1994 ) .",
    "if @xmath1 , there are several possible solutions or implications from the baryon over - density problem .    1 .",
    "[ point : mgrav ] the x - ray emitting gas has been concentrated with respect to the dark matter and the total cluster masses are much higher , or there is clustering of dark matter on larger scales , in a mixed dark matter universe .",
    "[ point : clumping ] the x - ray determined gas masses are over - estimated , due to clumping of the x - ray gas .",
    "[ point : anomoly ] the current examples of large baryon over - densities in clusters are unrepresentative of clusters in general . 4 .",
    "[ point : lambda ] the cosmological constant , @xmath21 , is non - zero and contributes to the density parameter such that @xmath22 ( see the review by carrol , press & turner 1992 ) .",
    "[ point : ibbns ] @xmath14 can be higher if the universe is inhomogeneous at the time of nucleosynthesis .",
    "[ point : bbns ] the new calculations of standard primordial nucleosynthesis or the primordial abundance measurements are incorrect , or they are very less tightly constrained , allowing @xmath23 ( if some abundance determinations are incorrect ) .    recent work on inhomogeneous nucleosynthesis ( jedamzik , fuller , & mathews 1994 ) now shows that [ point : ibbns ] is not viable , and [ point : bbns ] seems unlikely given the physics involved is well understood .",
    "solution [ point : clumping ] is unlikely to cause a significant discrepancy , as shown later in this paper ( see also mchardy 1990 )",
    ". we shall discuss solution [ point : mgrav ] , which implies that there are significant masses of gravitating matter outside the regions of the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the main focus of this paper is to investigate point [ point : anomoly ] by determining gas masses to large radii in a number of clusters .",
    "our determinations have been made from x - ray image - deprojection analysis of 19 clusters of galaxies which were observed with the imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) .",
    "these are x - ray luminous ( @xmath24 ) and moderately distant ( @xmath25 ) clusters which are easily covered by the ipc field of view , and have no strong contaminating sources to their surface brightness profiles .",
    "this enables their gas masses to be well determined out to between 1 to @xmath26 .",
    "we have used the x - ray image deprojection technique ( pioneered by fabian 1981 ) . this method assumes a spherical geometry for the cluster , and enables the volume count emissivity from the hot intracluster gas to be determined as a function of radius .",
    "the properties of the intracluster medium ( icm ) can then be determined after corrections for attenuation of the cluster emission due to absorption from intervening material , and assumptions on the form of the underlying gravitational potential of the cluster .",
    "detailed descriptions and recent examples of the current analysis method and procedure can be found in the description of the analysis of position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) and high resolution imager ( hri ) data , on a478 , by allen ( 1993 ) and d.  white ( 1994 ) , respectively .",
    "this analysis differs from previous deprojection analyses , which have concentrated on investigation of the cooling flow properties of clusters , as such studies required relatively small radial bins to resolve the cooling time of the intracluster gas at the very centre of the cluster .",
    "we are interested in accurate determinations of the total gas masses in clusters to large radii and so large radial bins , which improve the signal - to - noise of the data , enable deprojection to greater radii .",
    "the clusters in our sample were selected to be bright and moderately distant so that the emission can be followed to sufficient radius within the field of view of the ipc .",
    "the x - ray emission of the cluster should also be relatively symmetrical with no significant contamination from sources which will produce significant errors in the gas mass determinations .",
    "most of the clusters which we selected do appear fairly spherically symmetric and smooth in the central regions , although there are some clusters where the emission in the outer regions is less regular ( notably a1763 , a3186 , a3266 and a3888 ) .",
    "however , as these results are not significantly different from the clusters which appear very regular ( such as a85 , a478 , a644 , a1795 and a2009 ) , we believe the results provide a good statistical indication of the baryon fraction in clusters , despite morphological details .    with",
    "the above criterion we formed our sample of 19 clusters , and obtained surface - brightness profiles from c.  jones , w.  forman and c.  stern at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics .",
    "we selected ipc rather that hri data for this analysis due its larger field of view and superior quantum efficiency .",
    "the poorer spatial resolution of the ipc , as we have noted is inconsequential .",
    "the point - spread function of the ipc , which is approximately 1 arcmin ( gaussian width ) , corresponds to relatively large radii at the moderate redshifts of the clusters in our sample .",
    "the data were corrected for the effects of the telescope vignetting , and the background contributions were estimated from the region just outside the maximum radius of each deprojection .",
    "this ensures that our estimates of the cluster gas masses are conservative as there may be some cluster emission outside the selected maximum radius .",
    "the deprojection of the surface brightness profile of each cluster requires the additional information , shown in table  [ table : input_data ] , such as the column density along the line - of - sight , the x - ray temperature and velocity dispersion of each cluster .",
    "the total attenuation of x - rays from the cluster is dependent on the absorption ( note we use photoelectric absorption cross - sections given by morrison & mccammon 1983 ) within our galaxy and intrinsic absorption .",
    "d.  white ( 1991b ) have shown that many clusters appear to have intrinsic absorption , but as we do not have such information for our whole sample we use estimates for the galactic contribution taken from the @xmath27 determinations by stark ( 1992 ) .",
    "the effect of possible excess absorption will be shown in section  [ section : gas_masses ] , but we note here that our prescription leads to conservative gas mass estimates .",

    "we used a two - component true - isothermal potential , each parameterised by a velocity dispersion and core - radius , with one potential for the cluster and another for a central cluster galaxy . only the cluster potential was varied ; the galaxy potential was fixed with a galaxy velocity dispersion of @xmath172 and a core - radius of @xmath173 .",
    "the effect of uncertainties in the cluster velocity dispersion , the effect of the mass from a central galaxy , and the use of different gravitational mass distributions on the results were all investigated , and are discussed in section  [ section : grav_masses ] .",
    "first we discuss the choice of cluster velocity dispersions and core radii .",
    "the cluster velocity dispersions were chosen from the literature where available .",
    "however , when we could find no suitable value , or there appeared to be some problem obtaining a satisfactory deprojection results , we obtained a value from the following relationship between the velocity dispersion and observed x - ray temperature : @xmath174^{0.528}\\kmps.\\ ] ] this relationship was determined ( d.  white in preparation ) using the ` orthogonal distance regression ' algorithm ( see the odrpack v2.01 software by boggs 1990 , discussed in relation to astronomical data analysis by feigelson & babu 1992 ) , and accounts for errors in both axes of the data  an essential feature when the errors in both dimensions are significant .",
    "the final velocity dispersions that were used , and the source of these values , are given in table  [ table : input_data ] .",
    "suitable values for cluster core radii are more difficult to obtain than velocity dispersion values .",
    "although they are available from the x - ray surface brightness profiles of clusters , and are less prone than optical values to contamination from sub - structure within the cluster , they can be affected by the presence of a cooling flow ( which enhances the x - ray emission within the central @xmath175 to @xmath176 , as shown by forman & jones 1984 ) .",
    "therefore we have not used the values for core - radii given in the literature , but used the core radius as a free parameter because it can significantly alter the shape of the gravitational mass distribution . as the best and most widely available cluster temperatures for most of our sample are only spatially - averaged values for the whole cluster , determined from broad - beam detectors , we vary the core - radius and outer pressure to produce a temperature profile that is as consistent with the observed value over as large a radius of the cluster as possible , a flat temperature profile . this tends to overestimate the temperature at the centre of a cluster in a cooling flow cluster , but will lead to conservative estimates of the gas mass , as @xmath177 .",
    "the final selections of core radius and outer pressure used in each cluster are given in table  [ table : results ] .",
    "note , we do not assign a particular significance to the core - radii that we have used in this analysis ; it was essentially used as a parameter to obtain flat deprojected temperature profile for each cluster .",
    "this also produces conservative gas mass estimates , because the temperature at the centre will be hotter than expected in a cooling flow cluster .",
    "this may not represent the true form of the temperature profile , and our resulting core - radii may be somewhat misleading .",
    "this may explain some of the large core - radii , although it may also be due to unresolved physical substructure in the x - ray emission .",
    "we also note that as the baryon fraction varies with radius according to the core radius used , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figure : core ] .",
    "we have therefore quoted our results at the maximum radius of each deprojection to ensure the results are not affected by the core - radii that were used .",
    "the baryon fractions that we determine from the deprojected value of @xmath178 at the maximum radii are given in table  [ table : results ] .",
    "they do not include the stellar contribution to the baryon content ( perhaps an extra 5 per cent ) .",
    "the results indicate that there is a wide variation between approximately 10 and 30 per cent , although some of this variation is due to an apparent trend for increasing baryon fraction with radius , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : mass_ratios ] .",
    "a linear regression to the data in this diagram ( shown by the dashed line ) indicates that the baryon fraction may be consistent with @xmath179 only at the very centre , but the mean value of the data points is much higher than the standard primordial nucleosynthesis value .",
    "we note that fig .",
    "[ figure : mass_ratios ] does not account for errors in the gravitational potential from the velocity dispersion , but we shall address this point in section  [ section : grav_masses ] .    the uncertainty from the core radius , and other parameters , on the determination of the baryon fractions has been assessed using the abell 478 data as a control data set . the results of these tests , which will be discussed in the following section and shown in table  [ table : tests ] , indicate that the gravitational potential of the cluster provides the main uncertainty in the baryon fraction determinations .",
    "as the deprojection estimates of the cluster baryon fraction are given by @xmath178 , we have estimated the susceptibility of the deprojection results to uncertainties in @xmath180 and @xmath181 resulting from changes in the input parameters for an individual cluster .",
    "we have also estimated the uncertainties in the baryon fraction due to using the observational errors in the x - ray temperatures .",
    "the deprojection method produces gas mass estimates that are statistically very well determined .",
    "we assume that the emission in the outer regions of clusters arises from thermal emission rather than non - thermal processes , as there is no evidence for significant non - thermal emission at large radii from the radio waveband .",
    "the main uncertainty in the gas masses arises from the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of a cluster , through the estimate of the distance to the cluster , intervening absorption , spherical symmetry , and the effect of clumping in the intracluster gas .",
    "all these points are addressed below .",
    "the effect of ellipticity in the cluster x - ray emission has been investigated by d.  white   ( 1994 ) in their analysis of hri data on a478 .",
    "they found that the ellipticity of @xmath182 in the x - ray emission produced an average ( and @xmath183 ) value of @xmath184 ( within @xmath17 ) from the deprojection of four sectors , as compared to @xmath185 from an azimuthal average .",
    "thus , within errors the effect of the spherical symmetry assumption is negligible .",
    "we also note that , although a cluster may appear spherically symmetric in projection , it may be extended in the line of sight .",
    "however , for a constant luminosity @xmath186 the volume @xmath187 would have to be increased by a factor of 16 to eliminate baryon over - densities of 4 . similarly , the accuracy of the background subtraction , which affects the luminosity estimate , would have to be wrong by a factor of 16 to reduce a baryon fraction of 25 per cent to the universal value of @xmath188 per cent .",
    "we therefore do not consider spherical asymmetries , either tangential or elongation along the line of sight , or background subtraction uncertainties , to be important effects in the baryon overdensities in clusters , especially if the baryon overdensities are shown to be common in a statistical sample of clusters such as ours .",

    "this is also approximately the core radius determined from a comparison of a deprojection and spectral analysis of pspc data ( allen 1993 ) .",

    "first , an evolutionary process , which may produce a central concentration of gas surrounded by an ` extended halo ' of dark matter , from the infall process which forms the clusters and/or the subsequent infall of sub - clusters .",
    "for example , if a gas - rich cluster fell into a larger cluster the gaseous component would be stripped from it in the dense central regions of the larger cluster , in a manner similar to the ram - pressure stripping of the hot gas from the elliptical galaxy m86 in the virgo cluster ( d.  white 1991a ) , while the collisionless dark matter would pass through unhindered to the other side of the cluster .",
    "this process would produce an atmosphere of gas which would be slightly more extended than the virial core of the cluster , due to shock heating , surrounded at larger radius by a halo of dark matter .",
    "this dark matter , if bound , may remain at large radius for a relatively large period of time before falling again towards the core of the cluster . thus , within the framework of hierarchical merging , infalling sub - clusters may produce significant amount of dark matter at large cluster radii .",
    "this scenario requires that clusters are more massive , approaching @xmath306 , than generally considered in current theories of cluster formation , and would result in large peculiar velocities around massive clusters of galaxies .",
    "other methods in which the dark matter could be distributed on larger scales rely on different clustering properties of the dark matter , if the universe is composed of a mixture of mostly hot with some cold dark matter , or if @xmath21 is non - zero .",
    "alternatively , if the central concentration of baryons with respect to the dark matter does not occur in the evolutionary scenario , then the gas needs to be distributed differently before the formation of clusters .",
    "however , as the gas is more concentrated than the gravitational matter , gravitational effects can not have been responsible , and the baryons must have been pushed together to form regions of higher density .",
    "this could have happened if there was a population of active quasars with strong winds or radiation pressure which produced voids in the early universe before cluster formation .",
    "the baryonic material would have been forced together at the interface between voids , at the sites of cluster formations , while the dark matter would have been less compressed .",
    "clusters would then have inherited the distributions of baryonic and non - baryonic material .",
    "this scenario leads to the prediction that there should be a population of objects at the centre of voids .",
    "none of the above solutions for the baryon over - densities resulting from standard primordial nucleosynthesis are very elegant or without problems . perhaps the most damning fact is that it appears extremely difficult to accumulate enough baryons from a region with a baryon density of at most 6 per cent to provide the overdensity seen to be common in our sample . as there is still evidence for @xmath1 on large scales , from studies of the structure in clusters ( richstone , loeb & turner 1992 ) , and the potent analysis of galaxies ( nusser & dekel 1993 , dekel 1993 , dekel & rees 1994 )",
    "we do not appeal to low values of @xmath307 , but assume that the dark matter in clusters is spread over a larger radius than the baryons .",
    "this means that clusters are several times more massive than is canonically assumed .",

    "the deprojection method produces well - determined gas masses , such that the main uncertainty in the gas mass lies in the value of the hubble constant , while the overall main uncertainty in the baryon fraction determinations lies is in the gravitational masses .",
    "however , this also can not produce a significant enough effect to reconcile the cluster determinations with the mean value predicted from standard primordial nucleosynthesis .",
