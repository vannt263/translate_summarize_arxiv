    "among the variants of the seesaw mechanism , inverse seesaw stands out as an attractive one due to its characteristic feature of generation of small neutrino mass without invoking high energy scale in the theory .",
    "although to realize such feature one has to pay the price in terms of incorporation of additional singlet fermions , nevertheless , in different gut models accommodation of such type of neutral fermions are natural .",
    "furthermore , such mechanism appeals to the foreseeable collider experiments to be testified due to its unique signature .",
    "the @xmath4 neutrino mass matrix in this mechanism is written as m_&= &    0&m_d&0 + m_d^t&0&m_rs + 0&m_rs^t & +    with the choice of basis @xmath5 .",
    "the three matrices appear in @xmath6 are @xmath0 , @xmath7 and @xmath1 among them @xmath0 and @xmath7 are dirac type whereas @xmath1 is majorana type mass matrix .",
    "after diagonalization , the low energy effective neutrino mass comes out as m_&= & m_d m_rs^-1 ( m_d m_rs^-1)^t + & = & ff^t[1 ] where @xmath8 .",
    "such definition resembles the above formula as a conventional type - i seesaw expression of @xmath6 .",
    "however , @xmath9 contains large number of parameters and it is possible to fit them with neutrino oscillation experimental data @xcite ( but the predictability is less ) . our goal in this work is to find out a phenomenologically viable texture of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with minimum number of parameters or equivalently maximum number of zeros .",
    "we bring together two theoretical ideas to find out a minimal texture and they are + i ) scaling ansatz@xcite , + ii ) texture zeros@xcite .",
    "+ 0.1 in at the outset of the analysis , we choose a basis where the charged lepton mass matrix ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath7 are diagonal along with texture zeros in @xmath0 and @xmath1 matrices .",
    "we also start by assuming the scaling property in the elements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to reduce the number of relevant matrices . although , we are not addressing the explicit origin of such choice of matrices , however",
    ", qualitatively we can assume that this can be achieved due to some flavour symmetry @xcite which is required to make certain that the texture zeros appear in @xmath0 and @xmath1 are in the same basis in which @xmath10 and @xmath7 are diagonal . we restrict ourselves within the frame work of @xmath11 gauge group however , explicit realization of such scheme obviously more elusive which will be studied elsewhere .",
    "we consider scaling property between the second and third row of @xmath0 matrix and the same for @xmath1 matrix also .",
    "explicitly the relationships are written as & = & k_1[2.1 ] + & = & k_2[2.2 ] where @xmath12 is the column index .",
    "we would like to mention that although we have considered different scale factors for @xmath0 and @xmath1 matrices , however , the effective @xmath6 is still scale invariant and leads to @xmath13 .",
    "thus , it is obvious to further break the scaling ansatz . in order to generate nonzero",
    "@xmath14 it is necessary to break the ansatz in @xmath0 since , breaking in @xmath1 does not affect the generation of nonzero @xmath14 although in some cases it provides @xmath15 . in our scheme texture",
    "zero format is robust and it remains intact while the scaling ansatz is explicitly broken .",
    "such a scenario can be realized by considering the scaling ansatz and texture zeros to have a different origin . +",
    "another point is to be noted that , since the @xmath1 matrix is complex symmetric whereas @xmath0 is asymmetric , the scale factor considered in @xmath1 matrix is different from that of @xmath0 to keep the row wise invariance as dictated by eqn.([2.1 ] ) ( for @xmath0 ) , and eqn.([2.2 ] ) ( for @xmath1 ) .",
    "finally , since the texture of @xmath7 matrix is diagonal it is not possible to accommodate scaling ansatz considered in the present scheme .",
    "+ let us now turn to further constrain the matrices assuming zeros in different entries . since , in our present scheme the matrix @xmath7 is diagonal , we constrain the other two matrices .",

    "we focus on the phenomenology of the neutrino mass matrix where the scaling ansatz is broken in both the sectors .",

    "it is to be noted that although the @xmath59 parameter is restricted due to @xmath14 value , @xmath96 is almost insensitive to @xmath14 and it can vary within a wide range as @xmath98 . a correlation plot of @xmath59 with @xmath96 is shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , the effect of the breaking term should be smaller than the unbroken one , therefore , to obtain the parameter space for this category we consider breaking of the scaling ansatz in both the sectors only upto 10 % and consequently for all combinatorial values of @xmath59 and @xmath96 the parameters @xmath78 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 vary within the ranges as @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",

    "thus the speculation of hierarchy in the present scheme will be clearly verified . moreover , taking the difference of probabilities between @xmath109 and @xmath110 information on the value of @xmath2 can be obtained using neutrino and anti neutrino beams .",
    "more precise estimation of the sum of the three light neutrino masses will be obtained utilizing a combined analysis with planck data@xcite and other cosmological and astrophysical experiments@xcite such as , baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey , the dark energy survey , large synoptic survey telescope or the euclid satellite data@xcite etc .",
    "such type of analysis will push @xmath111 ev ( at the @xmath112 level for inverted ordering ) and @xmath113 ev ( at the @xmath114 level for normal ordering ) .",
    "thus the prediction of the value of @xmath71 in the different categories discussed in the present work will also be tested in the near future .",
    "furthermore , the next-100@xcite will probe the value of @xmath75 up to @xmath115 ev which is a more precise value than the exo-200@xcite experimental range ( 0.14 - 0.38 ev ) .",

    "it is found that four is the maximum number of zeros that can be allowed in @xmath0 and @xmath1 matrices to obtain viable phenomenology .",
    "we classify different four zero textures in four different categories depending upon their generic form .",
