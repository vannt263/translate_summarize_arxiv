    "the saffman - taylor problem  @xcite addresses motion of two viscous fluids in the narrow space between two plates , known as a hele - shaw cell .",
    "when a fluid of low viscosity displaces a fluid of higher viscosity , the interface between them becomes unstable and starts to deform .",
    "this problem is formally equivalent  @xcite to a special case of a solidification problem .",
    "experiments and theory focus on two basic flow geometries ( i ) rectangular  @xcite and ( ii ) radial  @xcite . for both geometries ,",
    "the initial developments of the interface instability tracks the predictions of linear stability theory  @xcite . as the unstable modes of perturbation grow ,",
    "they become coupled in a weakly nonlinear stage of evolution .",
    "finally , the system evolves to a complicated late stage , characterized by formation of fingering structures , in which nonlinear effects dominate .",
    "this paper addresses linear and the weakly nonlinear stages of the evolution .",
    "here we concentrate our attention on the radial flow geometry .",
    "we develop the mode coupling theory for the saffman - taylor problem .",
    "our approach is a complementary study to the purely linear investigations  @xcite and to recent developments in the analytical  @xcite and numerical  @xcite treatments of the fully nonlinear time - evolving flow .",
    "these analytical works  @xcite describe the early and late stage dynamics of the interface in the small surface tension limit , using conformal mapping techniques .",
    "efficient numerical simulations  @xcite describe complex flow patterns , for both large and small surface tension , employing a boundary integral formulation of the equations of motion . on the other hand ,",
    "our analytical weakly nonlinear study investigates the intermediate stage between the purely linear and the fully nonlinear ones , focusing on the onset of the nonlinear effects .",
    "our approach applies to any value of surface tension , and gives physical insight into mechanisms of pattern solution . in the context of solidification , both numerical  @xcite and weakly nonlinear  @xcite results",
    "are known .    in a separate publication  @xcite",
    "we develop the weakly nonlinear theory for rectangular flow geometry .",
    "although mathematically similar to the rectangular flow problem , the radial geometry imposes two important new elements : ( i ) the interface is always asymmetric because of the distinction between the area inside and outside of the boundary between the fluids ; ( ii ) the radial flow presents multiple stages of instability , with no true steady state attainable .",
    "experimental and theoretical investigations are plentiful for radial flow geometry hele - shaw cells  @xcite .",
    "these experiments   inject the less viscous fluid at the center of the cell , which was previously filled with the more viscous fluid .",
    "the injection is usually performed at a constant flow rate or constant pressure .",
    "initially , the interface ( bubble ) is circular .",
    "as the bubble develops , the interface undulates and fingers grow . as the size of the bubble increases , the fingers spread and their tips become blunt , creating a fan - like pattern .",
    "next , the fingers start to split at the tip .",
    "larger fingers shield smaller ones and the pattern develops asymmetrically , causing competition among fingers of different lengths . spreading ,",
    "splitting and competition are the three basic growth mechanisms of the viscous fingering process  @xcite .",
    "the linear stability of a circular interface evolving in a radial geometry flow hele - shaw cell was studied by bataille  @xcite , wilson  @xcite , and thereafter by paterson  @xcite .",
    "more recent experimental and theoretical work study the linear stage of the radial hele - shaw flow in a variety of situations : sader , chan and hughes  @xcite examined the linear stability analysis for the case of a non - newtonian displaced fluid ; carrillo et al .  @xcite considered radial flow in a rotating hele - shaw cell ; cardoso and woods  @xcite investigated the linear stability analysis of an annulus of fluid , bound by two other fluids of different viscosities .",
    "because of the complexity of the evolution , even at the level of linear analysis , this paper reviews certain results of the linear theory for the sake of comparison with the nonlinear analysis .",
    "the linear stability analysis applies only to early stages of the flow .",
    "moreover , it does not explain well the essential mechanisms of spreading , splitting and competition cited above . to analyze these effects , we develop the weakly nonlinear mode coupling theory of the radial flow in a hele - shaw cell .",
    "we focus on the onset of the nonlinear effects and their influence on the evolution of the unstable interface .",
    "we employ an analytical approach known as a mode coupling theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :",
    "section ii derives a differential equation describing the early nonlinear evolution of the interface modes . in section iii , we interpret results obtained in section ii and investigate both the linear and weakly nonlinear evolution of the system .",
    "our chief conclusions are presented in this section .",
    "we show that second order mode coupling explains the main features of patterning formation by coupling fundamental modes to harmonics and sub - harmonics .",

    "the interface evolution reverts to the simpler evolution of the rectangular flow geometry .",
    "for example , the constant area constraint becomes simple ( @xmath29 ) in this limit .",
    "the relevant hydrodynamic equation is darcy s law  @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are , respectively , the velocity and pressure in fluids @xmath33 and @xmath34 . at the interface , the pressure difference between the two fluids is given by  @xcite @xmath35 the curvature in the direction perpendicular to the plates ( @xmath36 ) is nearly constant  @xcite . because its gradient is nearly zero , it does not significantly affect the motion in our problem .",

    "we are interested in second order contributions in the perturbation amplitudes .",
    "therefore , all the quantities in equation  ( [ dimensionless2 ] ) are evaluated at the perturbed interface @xmath48 , and not at the initial unperturbed interface position @xmath49 as is usually done in linearized surface deformation problems .",

    "the approach of each term to its limit is @xmath79 . in the following section we investigate the radial geometry equation  ( [ result ] ) in more detail",
    "considering the complexity of the flow , we begin by analyzing certain aspects of the linear theory .",
    "this analysis is needed for our subsequent weakly nonlinear investigation ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "first consider the purely linear contribution , which appears as the first term on the right hand side of equation  ( [ result ] ) . since @xmath49 varies with time",
    ", the linear growth rate @xmath74 is time dependent as well .",

    "two other relevant facts can be extracted from the linear growth rate : ( i ) the existence of a series of critical radii at which the interface becomes unstable for a given mode @xmath13 ( defined by setting @xmath83 ) , @xmath84 ( ii ) the presence of a fastest growing mode @xmath85 , given by the closest integer to the maximum of equation  ( [ growth ] ) with respect to @xmath13 ( defined by setting @xmath86 ) , @xmath87 note that @xmath85 varies with time . in view of equation  ( [ relax ] )",
    "@xmath85 is not simply related to the number of fingers present , even in the early stages of pattern formation .",
    "furthermore , in the nonlinear regime the subsequent tip - splitting process and mode competition result in a final number of fingers which can differ from the number present in the linear regime .    inspired by a model developed by cardoso and woods  @xcite ( their `` model b '' ) , we describe the behavior of the system assuming the presence of a constant low level of noise during the whole evolution of the interface .",
    "the sources of noise may come , for instance , from inhomogeneities on the surface of the hele - shaw cell , irregularities in the gap thickness @xmath0 , or even from thermal or pressure fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the predictions of this model are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations within the linear regime  @xcite .",
    "we perform a detailed investigation of this model in the linear regime and extend its range of applicability to the weakly nonlinear stage of evolution .",
    "suppose that we begin with an initially circular interface that is steadily expanding . during the interface expansion each mode @xmath13",
    "is perturbed with a constant ( in time ) random complex amplitude @xmath88 .",
    "this noise amplitude contains an @xmath13 dependent random phase but its magnitude @xmath89 is independent of @xmath13 by assumption .",

    "figure 2 , depicts the evolution of the interface , for a random choice of phases , up to time @xmath111 @xmath103 .",
    "linear evolution proceeds through a cascade of modes , with increasing participation of higher modes @xmath13 as time progresses . the number of fingers is typically given by the mode @xmath13 which has grown to largest amplitude .",
    "variability of finger lengths depends primarily on modes of smaller @xmath13 .",
    "modes of larger @xmath13 can cause the tips of the fingers to split .",
    "for the early evolution of the interface , patterns like those shown in figure 2 resemble well the experimental patterns found in the literature  .",
    "in contrast to the experiments , some important features are not present in figure 2 , revealing failure of the purely linear approach . spreading of the fingers , which is observed in the experiments , is not clearly shown in figure 2 .",
    "experimentally , the tips of fingers tend to split .",
    "to observe finger - splitting using the linear theory , we would have to go to unrealisticly long times .",
    "finger competition , also , is not as pronounced in the linear theory as in experiment .",
    "these last few remarks indicate that , despite being an adequate approximation for early times , a purely linear theory does not describe all the basic physical mechanisms ( spreading , splitting and competition ) involved in the pattern formation .",
    "the linear regime is valid only for a limited initial period beyond which nonlinear effects take over .",
    "the nonlinear effects considered here come from the contributions of the second term on the right hand side of equation  ( [ result ] ) .",
    "let us begin by briefly describing the various pieces appearing in this second term .",
    "the function @xmath112 , which multiplies the term @xmath113 , presents two parts ( see equation  ( [ f ] ) ) having distinct origins : the first one comes from the unperturbed radial flow ( equation  ( [ steady ] ) ) evaluated at the perturbed interface @xmath114 , while the second one arises from the second order terms in @xmath20 present in the curvature ( see equation  ( [ kappa ] ) ) .",
    "neither term survives in the rectangular geometry limit . on the other hand , the function @xmath115 ( see equation  ( [ g ] ) ) multiplies the term @xmath116 , which couples the perturbed flow @xmath69 with the interface shape perturbation @xmath20 .",

    "this solution describes the weakly nonlinear evolution , where the dominant modes just become coupled by nonlinear effects .",
    "we use the second order solution  ( [ sol ] ) to investigate the nonlinear coupling among various modes @xmath13 .",
    "once again , we use the sine and cosine mode representation for the net perturbation @xmath11 . in figure 3",
    ", we plot the interface for a certain time ( @xmath111 @xmath122 ) , considering the same random choice of initial phases as was employed in figure 2 , and coupling all modes with @xmath123 .",
    "the solid curve represents the interface shape obtained from the mode coupling solution  ( [ sol ] ) , and the dashed line represents the interface in the linear approximation ( taken from figure 2 ) .",
    "the two interfaces are plotted together to facilitate comparison between the linear and nonlinear approaches .",
    "as we can see , the nonlinear evolution leads to wider fingers and their tips become more blunt .",
    "these fingers spread and some of them start to bifurcate , by splitting at the tip",
    ". the onset of finger competition is also observed , with some fingers slightly enhanced and others diminished .    even though the differences between the two evolutions are not dramatic , we see that the nonlinear approach developed here leads to a more realistic description of the radial fingering patterns .",
    "the effects of finger spreading , finger tip - splitting and finger competition are all present .",
    "the fact that the second order pattern is quantitatively close to the linear pattern suggests that the nonlinearities are fairly accurately described up to @xmath111 @xmath122 by second order mode coupling theory , because the contributions of third and higher order terms should be smaller yet .",
    "one interesting point to be discussed is the evolution of a particular mode and its interaction with its sub - harmonics and harmonics ( figure 4 ) .",
    "here we concentrate our attention on a small number of modes .",
    "this situation is obviously idealized compared with interaction of all modes illustrated in figure 3 , but it gives us good indications about the role of mode coupling during interface evolution .    for convenience",

    "there is no @xmath172 term in the equation of motion , consistent with the demands of @xmath173 invariance of the radial geometry equations of motion .",
    "however , our discussion above shows that a fundamental mode @xmath13 spontaneously generates its own harmonic @xmath156 of order @xmath174 .",
    "this harmonic couples back into the equation of motion for @xmath129 ( replace @xmath175 in equation  ( [ new5 ] ) ) , resulting in an @xmath176 diminution over the linear growth of @xmath129 . in real space ,",
    "a growing finger broadens as it pushes into the more viscous fluid .",
    "the broadened finger becomes increasingly resistant to further growth .",
    "the third order coupling of a mode with itself was studied in related solidification models  @xcite .    in order to reinforce the conclusions of the previous paragraphs , compare the time evolution of the fundamental , harmonic and sub - harmonic perturbation amplitudes following the linear  ( [ linear ] ) and nonlinear  ( [ sol ] ) solutions . in figure 5",
    "we present the time evolution of the perturbation amplitudes @xmath129 for the modes @xmath13=4 , 8 and 16 as given by the simple linear superposition of these modes ( dashed curves ) and by our weakly nonlinear mode coupling theory ( solid curves ) .",
    "we observe that the weakly nonlinear coupling dictates the enhanced growth of both sub - harmonic ( @xmath177 ) and first harmonic ( @xmath178 ) modes while diminishing the growth of the fundamental ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "the sign of the harmonic ( @xmath178 ) is dictated as well , going strongly negative although its initial value was positive .",
    "therefore , the nonlinear effects naturally enhance finger competition and tendency to finger tip - splitting .",
    "in this paper , we studied the onset of nonlinear effects in the radial viscous fingering in a hele - shaw cell . while reasonably accurate for the initial stages of the flow , linear stability theories do not explain well the origin of the essential mechanisms of finger spreading , finger tip - splitting and finger competition .",

    "we compared the radial flow geometry with the simpler case of flow in rectangular channels  @xcite .",
    "the rectangular geometry represents a special case of the radial flow , in which effects of curvature of the unperturbed interface vanish .",
    "finger splitting , in the radial flow geometry , is driven by curvature of the unperturbed interface .",
    "tendency towards finger splitting may be controlled by adjusting this interfacial curvature .",
    "presumably similar control is possible by performing the flow in curved two - dimensional spaces . such effectively two - dimensional curved spaces may be found between curved surfaces embedded in three dimensions , separated from each other by a small distance @xmath0 .",
    "positive spatial curvature ( e.g. , flow between concentric spheres ) should inhibit finger splitting while negative curvature ( e.g. , flow between saddle shape surfaces ) should enhance it .",
