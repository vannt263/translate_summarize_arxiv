    "recently , physical layer ( phy ) security for wireless communications has become an important research area .",
    "the underlying idea is to guarantee a positive secrecy rate of legitimate users by exploiting the random characteristics of the wireless channel . in particular",
    ", the authors in @xcite proposed a low - complexity on / off power allocation strategy to attain secrecy under the assumption of full channel state information ( csi ) .",
    "the use of cooperative jamming noise ( jn ) was proposed in @xcite , where users who are prevented from transmitting according to a certain policy will block the eavesdropper and thereby assist the remaining users . from a quality - of - service perspective , a secret transmit beamforming approach was considered in @xcite , in order to predetermine the signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratio ( sinr ) target at the destination and/or at the eavesdropper .",
    "being a critical issue , phy security of cognitive radio networks ( crns ) , which are faced with specific security risks due to the broadcasting nature of radio signals @xcite , however , has not been well investigated until recently , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "more specifically , in @xcite and @xcite , multi - antennas at the secondary transmitter were utilized to attain beamforming that maximizes the secrecy capacity of the secondary system , while adhering to the peak interference constraint at the primary receiver .",
    "furthermore , a simple case with single antenna at the eavesdropper was considered in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors considered a crn model , where both the primary user ( pu ) and the secondary user ( su ) send their confidential messages to intended receivers that are surrounded by a single eavesdropper .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the phy security in cooperative cognitive radio multicast communications , where the eavesdroppers intend to wiretap data from both the primary and secondary systems .",
    "we assume that the primary transmitter is equipped only with a single antenna , which implies that the primary transmitter can not generate a jamming signal or design a beamforming vector to protect itself from the eavesdroppers .",
    "the secrecy capacity of the primary system is improved by implementing a cooperative framework between the primary and secondary systems .",
    "specifically , the primary allows the secondary system to share its spectrum , and in return the secondary system sends jamming noise to degrade the eavesdropper s channel , in order to protect the primary system .",
    "specifically , the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows :    * we design a joint information and jamming signal at the secondary transmitter , where information is intended for secondary receivers and jamming noise is intended for eavesdroppers .",
    "the main objective is to maximize the secrecy rate of the secondary system , while satisfying the minimum secrecy rate requirement for each legitimate user of the primary system as well as the power constraint .",
    "* we propose a method to find the approximate solution for optimal transmit beamforming , by providing the convexity of the problem that is considered through the use of a convex approximation .",
    "the optimal solutions of transmit beamforming for the confidential information and jamming noise do not fix the transmit strategy .",
    "* we provide extensive numerical results to justify the novelty of the proposed algorithm and compare its performance with the known solutions . in particular , the numerical results demonstrate fast convergence of the proposed algorithm and significantly improve the secrecy rate compared with the known solutions .",
    "we should remark that our results are more general than in @xcite , which was considered under the assumptions of one eavesdropper and perfect csi .",
    "the primary system consists of one primary transmitter ( pt ) and @xmath0 primary receivers ( prs ) , while the secondary system consists of one secondary transmitter ( st ) and @xmath1 secondary receivers ( srs ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the st , which is a base station ( bs ) , is equipped with @xmath2 antennas , whereas all other nodes are equipped with only one antenna .",
    "the opportunistic spectrum access is improved by assigning the st to send @xmath3 information bearing signals @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the information being sent to the @xmath6-th group with unit average power @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that each individual multicast group @xmath8 in the secondary system consists of @xmath9 the secondary receivers .",
    "specifically , the number of srs in group @xmath8 is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "then , the total number of srs in the secondary system with multicast transmission is indeed @xmath11 . regarding security , we assume that the eavesdroppers ( eves ) potentially intend to wiretap and decode confidential messages from both the primary and secondary systems @xcite .",
    "we assume that each group @xmath8 and the prs are respectively wiretapped by a set of eves such as @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this implies that at the same time , each legitimate user is wiretapped by a separate group of eves .",
    "we aim to design multiple beamforming vectors at the st , one for the jn and the other for its own information signal , to protect both the primary and secondary systems .",
    "the transmit power at the pt is @xmath15 and the data intended for the pr is @xmath16 with unit average power @xmath17 . before transmission , the data of the srs @xmath5 in the group @xmath8",
    "is weighted to the @xmath18 beamforming vector @xmath19 , @xmath13 .",
    "hence , all the transmitted signals at the st can be expressed through a vector @xmath20 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the artificial noise vector , whose elements are zero - mean complex gaussian random variables with covariance matrix @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",

    "<S> in this paper , we propose a cooperative approach to improve the security of both primary and secondary systems in cognitive radio multicast communications . during their access to the frequency spectrum licensed to the primary users , the secondary unlicensed users assist the primary system in fortifying security by sending a jamming noise to the eavesdroppers , while simultaneously protect themselves from eavesdropping . </S>",
    "<S> the main objective of this work is to maximize the secrecy rate of the secondary system , while adhering to all individual primary users secrecy rate constraints . in the case of passive eavesdroppers and imperfect channel state information knowledge at the transceivers , </S>",
    "<S> the utility function of interest is nonconcave and involved constraints are nonconvex , and thus , the optimal solutions are troublesome . </S>",
    "<S> to address this problem , we propose an iterative algorithm to arrive at a local optimum of the considered problem . the proposed iterative algorithm is guaranteed to achieve a karush - kuhn - tucker solution . </S>"
