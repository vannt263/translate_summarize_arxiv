    "the relative normalisation of data on @xmath5 and @xmath52 will play an important role : @xmath53      at this point , it is necessary to pause and ask whether decays to @xmath54 are affected by the fact that they are identical particles , whereas @xmath55 are not .",

    ", the amplitude may be written @xmath77 and there is a zero in @xmath78 at the adler point @xmath79 , just below threshold [ 17 ] .",
    "the adler zero is a basic feature of chiral perturbation theory and figures prominently in the series of papers on @xmath6 , @xmath80 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 by oset and collaborators [ 18 - 23 ] .",
    "data on @xmath81 may be fitted in both magnitude and phase using @xmath82 with the same denominator but a constant numerator [ 24 ] .",
    "the justification is that left - hand singularities due to coupling of @xmath6 to @xmath83 are very distant .",
    "the question is whether the adler zero is needed in the amplitude for fitting kloe data or not .",
    "an interesting intermediate case is the production of the @xmath84 s - wave in @xmath85 .",
    "recent belle data determine @xmath18 mass spectra for the transitions @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 [ 25 ] . the first and last follow elastic scattering closely .",
    "the transition @xmath87 deviates from this and shows a peak towards the @xmath18 threshold , reminiscent of that observed in @xmath81 , where the adler zero is absent .",
    "the combined mass of @xmath89 and @xmath69 lies close to the @xmath90 threshold , and moxhay suggests that the decay proceeds through coupling to @xmath90 intermediate states [ 26 ] .",
    "these data suggest that for small momentum transfers the adler zero _ is _ needed in the amplitude unless there is a flavour change . from fig .",
    "1 for @xmath12 radiative decays , it is plausible that the right - hand vertex should be the same as that in the on - shell @xmath91 process , since the kinematics are similar .",
    "it will be shown that this successfully fits the data .",
    "there are also amplitudes due to @xmath94 , @xmath92 and @xmath95 .",
    "formulae for their intensities and interferences with @xmath17 or @xmath16 are given by bramon et al .",

    "the @xmath98 contribution to @xmath14 peaks at @xmath99 mev and is small .",
    "interferences with @xmath4 have rather little effect on the fit to @xmath100 .",
    "however , the contribution of @xmath101 is quite significant in @xmath19 .    branching fractions for these processes will now be discussed , starting with @xmath95 .",
    "achasov et al .",
    "@xmath102 kev [ 31 ] .",
    "this agrees with the pdg average for @xmath103 of @xmath104 kev .",
    "the weighted average is @xmath105 kev .",
    "the pdg gives an average for @xmath106 . dividing this by 3 for neutral final states and assuming it is all @xmath98 , the branching fraction of @xmath107 is @xmath108 .",
    "the experimental groups apply cuts to remove @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "it is hard to estimate the fraction of @xmath111 events which this removes ; a sharp cut in the @xmath112 line - shape at the quoted mass cut leaves @xmath113 of @xmath111 events , i.e. a branching fraction of @xmath114 .",
    "the uncertainty is not serious , since most events lie at low @xmath54 masses and have little effect on the @xmath4 peak .",
    "the arithmetic for the @xmath111 contribution to @xmath115 goes similarly .",
    "the weighted mean of snd [ 31 ] and cmd2 [ 32 ] values for @xmath116 is @xmath117 . taking the @xmath118 branching fraction to be 0.151/3 , as above , and using the kloe branching fraction @xmath119 , the ratio @xmath120 .",
    "these events do contribute significantly to the fit ; interference with @xmath121 is included .",
    "there is a major question how to combine the amplitudes for @xmath4 and the broad @xmath6 .",
    "data on @xmath18 elastic scattering from the cern - munich experiment and elsewhere show that phase shifts of @xmath4 and @xmath6 add to a good approximation .",
    "both go through @xmath26 near 1 gev and the phase shift for the full amplitude passes rapidly through @xmath122 just below 1 gev . a natural and successful way of describing this situation is the dalitz - tuan prescription [ 33 ] , where s - matrices of the two components are multiplied : @xmath123 however , it is not obvious that it is right to multiply elasticities .",
    "an alternative approach is to use the k - matrix .",
    "it is conventional to add k - matrix elements for the two components [ 12 ] .",
    "the penalty in this approach is that each k - matrix pole appears where the total phase goes through @xmath26 ; the @xmath4 is then described as a delicate interference between two poles displaced substantially from 1 gev . in the present work that is inconvenient",
    ", since @xmath4 is the focus of attention in @xmath12 decays ; a formula is needed to parametrise it directly .",
    "furthermore , it is not obvious that nature chooses to add k - matrix elements .",
    "since @xmath124 , an alternative choice is @xmath125 so that phases again add below the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "however , this alternative fails to fit @xmath8 data immediately above the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "this is because inelasticity of the @xmath6 amplitude grows fairly slowly above threshold , so eqn .",
    "( 16 ) demands a rather elastic amplitude there .",
    "one can not add inelasticities of @xmath4 and @xmath6 , since this leads to values outside the unitary circle .",
    "the approach adopted here is pragmatic .",
    "the dalitz - tuan prescription is simple , fits the phase of elastic scattering adequately , predicts a reasonable result for the elasticity parameter @xmath126 and successfully fits the data .",
    "the @xmath126 parameter for the bes @xmath4 drops precipitously to @xmath127 at 1.01 gev and then rises again ( see fig .",
    "11(a ) below ) .",
    "since @xmath4 and @xmath6 are approximately in phase , it seems likely that the effect of the @xmath6 component will be to increase the inelasticity to a value somewhere between 0 and the value for @xmath4 alone . in practice , multiplying the s - matrix elements for @xmath128 and @xmath129 describes the data well up to 1.2 gev , obtaining @xmath130 from the exact relation @xmath131 where indices 1,2,3 refer to @xmath18 , @xmath1 and @xmath132 .",
    "note , however , that @xmath130 itself does not factorise into @xmath4 and @xmath6 components .",
    "this is a symptom of extensive multiple scattering .",
    "it may well be that there is no simple formula which fully describes strong coupling of the two amplitudes .",
    "above 1.2 gev , the appearance of @xmath11 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 makes the treatment via the dalitz - tuan prescription intractable .",
    "there , amplitudes are small enough that unitarity corrections are less than normalisation errors , and it is adequate to add amplitudes .",
    "that is the procedure adopted here , making a smooth join at 1.17 gev using lagrange multipliers to ensure that the magnitude and phase join continuously . for the @xmath135 channel ,",
    "amplitudes are so small that unitarity plays no significant role , so one can add amplitudes",
    ".    at the higher masses , @xmath11 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 overlap significantly .",
    "the overlap makes the phase of the background below each resonance a sensitive parameter . in order to achieve a satisfactory fit ,",
    "it is necesssary to multiply each amplitude by a fitted phase factor @xmath136 and add amplitudes .    in summary",
    ", multiplying @xmath126 parameters near threshold puts a lower bound on the intensity 92% of the unitarity limit , and reduces the normalisation uncertainty from 50 to 8% . at higher masses ,",
    "the amplitude is fitted freely in terms of known resonance , ignoring possible multiple scattering from one resonance to another where they overlap .",
    "this allows maximum freedom to fit @xmath6 and @xmath4 , the main object of the present work .",
    "an important point is that the @xmath4 signal appears as a sharp dip in elastic scattering , because phases add . in @xmath12 radiative",
    "decays , it appears as a peak . in this case , it is appropriate to add amplitudes , since they are weak and the unitarity limit imposes no significant constraint ; in elastic scattering , the amplitude must follow the unitarity limit up to the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "both @xmath8 and @xmath9 cross sections drop fairly rapidly with increasing mass , and almost disappear above 1.9 gev . to some extent , this is due to competition from the @xmath43 channel .",
    "unfortunately , there are almost no data on the @xmath43 channel , so the @xmath31-dependence of this inelasticity is poorly known .",

    "( 21 ) by a factor @xmath144 where @xmath145 .",
    "the factor 0.41 comes from the work of leutwyler and colangelo , using chiral perturbation theory [ 34 ] .",
    "a form factor @xmath146 is included into channels 2 and 3 ( @xmath1 and @xmath147 in eqns . ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) .",
    "note that @xmath148 is multiplying the _ intensity _ of the @xmath1 channel , which is the quantity appearing in the width of the @xmath6 .",
    "it is required to parametrise the rapid drop of cross sections with increasing mass .",

( 21 ) and the form factors @xmath152 are superfluous because the resonances are narrow ; they are simply omitted , but the dispersive term @xmath153 is retained .",
