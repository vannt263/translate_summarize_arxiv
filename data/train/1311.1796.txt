    "another avenue is to utilize chemical doping with atoms or molecules that add or remove electrons from the conduction band@xcite or facilitate strong inter - valley scattering@xcite .",
    "properly understanding the consequences of the chemical doping makes it necessary to study the effective interaction between the dopants .",
    "the latter could create a variety of phases resulting from adatom ordering @xcite with major consequences for the possible applications .",
    "such interaction is mediated by conduction electrons and is similar to the classic casimir effect @xcite in which virtual photons are responsible for the coupling .",
    "the honeycomb geometry of graphene , however , adds new features to this phenomenon .",

    "additionally , the gapless character of the band spectrum of graphene allows to explore@xcite the `` intrinsic '' limit of @xmath5 , which does not have an analog in conventional metals . when two _ weak _ on - site potential impurities of strength @xmath6 are present the effective interaction depends on whether they reside on the same or different sublattices . in the former case",

    "the angle @xmath10 depends on both the length of the radius - vector @xmath11 and the angle @xmath12 it makes with the zigzag direction , see fig .  1 .",
    "in the case of impurities on different sublattices the interaction is stronger and repulsive , @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",

    "this situation of a resonant impurity can also be realized with an anderson impurity whose localized level is close to the dirac point @xcite .",
    "since the strength @xmath6 can thus not enter the expression for the effective energy , by dimension , it can only be given by the ratio @xmath21 .",

    "( [ shytovab ] ) is _ non - perturbative_. we are now going to demonstrate that a _ single _ impurity level is responsible for this contribution to @xmath26 , and explain that this understanding leads to the possibility of controlling the sign of the interaction by adjusting the chemical potential .",
    "the sensitivity of the interaction between two adatom to the chemical potential has previously been reported on the basis of numerical studies @xcite , however , the underlying physical mechanism of the impurity level formation has not been elucidated nor has it been shown to extend to the case of many randomly distributed adatoms as is the subject of this paper .",
    "we consider a tight - binding model of @xmath30-electrons in graphene interacting with two on - site potential impurities positioned at @xmath31 and @xmath32 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath33 the operators @xmath34(@xmath35 ) create electrons on the corresponding sites of the sublattice @xmath36(@xmath37 ) ; the vectors @xmath38 connect @xmath36-atoms with their three nearest @xmath37-neighbors .",

    "this means that no impurity state can cross the dirac point . for large values of @xmath68 , both values are very close to the @xmath63 level , @xmath69 , and contribute negligibly to the total energy of the system , as illustrated in fig .",

    "decreasing @xmath70 below the energy of the lower impurity state , eq .",
    "( [ ablevels ] ) , or increasing it above the upper level ( so that both levels are empty or populated ) would negate the effects of the impurity levels and lead to the disappearance of the attractive contribution in eq .",
    "( [ shytovab ] ) rendering the residual interaction _ repulsive_. let us emphasize that this sign reversal is different from the friedel oscillations in a doped graphene .",
    "the latter develop when @xmath71 while in our case significantly lower changes in the chemical potential are needed , @xmath72 .",
    "we are now going to show that this effect survives when the number of impurities scales with the size of the system .",
    "when impurities with finite density @xmath73 are randomly distributed in the system , the stronger attraction from @xmath45 pairs dominates over the weaker repulsion of @xmath48 and @xmath74 pairs @xcite .",
    "our numerical findings also support this for @xmath61 , but with increasing @xmath70 , the transition to the repulsive regime occurs , similarly to the two - impurity case . in particular , we considered rectangular graphene samples described by the hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] ) with @xmath75 atoms , and@xcite @xmath76 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed along both armchair ( @xmath77 ) and zigzag ( @xmath78 ) directions .",
    "the energy spectrum of the sample is found by the exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian and the sum over all filled states is then taken to give the total energy @xmath79 in the presence of @xmath80 impurities .",
    "the interaction energy @xmath81 is obtained by subtracting the energy of independent impurities , @xmath82 the definition ( [ interaction_energy_definition ] ) is different from that of ref .  , where the term linear in @xmath80 was allowed to be an adjustable fitting parameter . while we are in a qualitative agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite in case of @xmath61 , our numerical results differ significantly from those reported in ref .",
    "when _ the number of electrons @xmath83 _ corresponds to @xmath84 .",
    "most notably , we obtain that the sign of @xmath81 can be reversed if the chemical potential is set sufficiently high , see fig .",
    "3 . this would occur , for example , if the impurities were placed on an isolated sheet of graphene so that @xmath83 is kept equal to the total number of carbon sites @xmath44 .",
    "the sign reversal can be explained with the help of the same `` dirac point crossing '' picture illustrated in fig .",
    "when @xmath80 resonant impurities are spread over the system , the same number of low - energy levels are created .",
    "since impurities are distributed randomly and uniformly over @xmath36 and @xmath37 sites , two phenomena occur simultaneously : `` _ aa_-type '' accumulation just below @xmath63 within a narrow energy range @xmath85 , and the formation of the `` _ ab_-type '' impurity bands on both sides of @xmath63 .",
    "the number of states that cross the @xmath63 level is @xmath86 , with @xmath87 levels accumulated near @xmath63 ( for small concentrations @xmath73 , we observe that @xmath88 ) .",
    "we stress that the attraction of the impurities ( @xmath89 ) is _ solely _ due to the fact that those states that crossed the dirac point remain _ unfilled _ when @xmath61 .    to the contrary ,",
    "if , for example , the number of electrons is kept fixed instead ( @xmath90 ) , exactly @xmath91 levels with positive energies have to be occupied .",
    "occupation of each impurity state is detrimental to the attraction .",
    "not all of the impurity states , however , are going to be occupied as other ( propagating ) states of similar energies `` compete '' for the same @xmath92 electrons ( taking into account spin degeneracy ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is easy to see that , in the logarithmic approximation , @xmath93 , _ most _ of the impurity states will be occupied .",
    "indeed , one would require the linear band to be filled up to the energy @xmath94 to accommodate @xmath95 electrons .",
    "on the other hand , the characteristic energy scale of the impurity band is smaller , @xmath96 . in other words ,",
    "the mean level spacing in the impurity band is logarithmically smaller than the level spacing of the propagating states , resulting in the large fraction of the former being populated when @xmath83 is made equal to the number of carbon sites @xmath44 or exceed it , which is the case when @xmath70 is increased further .",
    "[ fig3 ] provides a numerical confirmation of these semi - qualitative arguments .",
    "additionally , we numerically observe that the ratio of the number of electrons that need to be removed from the @xmath30-band to the total number of impurity atoms to reach the attraction to repulsion transition is @xmath97 rather independently from the concentration of impurities in the range from @xmath98 to @xmath99 .",
    "another realization of a resonant impurity limit is the case of a missing carbon atom .",
    "we observe numerically that modeling such vacancies in terms of zero hoppings to / from the neighboring sites gives results that are very close to the model of a strong on - site potential @xmath6 .",
    "another difference is that in a neutral graphene with @xmath80 vacancies @xmath80 electrons are missing from the @xmath30-band .",
    "since the number of states `` escaped '' through the dirac point is @xmath95 ( twice the number of levels ) , which is somewhat less than @xmath80 , the chemical potential of the neutral graphene with vacancies is _ negative _ ( but close to @xmath63 ) , resulting in the attraction of vacancies .",
    "this is opposite to the sign of the interaction in a neutral sample with potential impurities ( where @xmath100 ) .",
    "still , when the interaction is studied as a function of the chemical potential the two cases yield virtually indistinguishable results .",
    "for this reason datasets for vacancies are not shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the interaction of resonant impurities in graphene displays a transition in their net interaction from attraction to repulsion depending on the chemical potential .",
    "this phenomenon is traced to the existence of impurity levels with energies @xmath101 that appear when impurities reside on the opposite sublattices .",
    "asymmetric filling of such states , which occurs for a chemical potential close to the dirac point @xmath63 , favors attraction . with the change of the chemical potential",
    "the interaction becomes repulsive as the continuum of propagating states dominates .",
    "this mechanism suggests the possibility of a transition from aggregation of adatoms to their dispersion , which could be advantageous for graphene functionalization .",
    "in particular , the possibility of controlling the conduction properties of graphene can be envisaged , with the metallic phase realized when gap - opening adatoms are aggregated in a small area of a graphene device and the semiconducting state occurring when they are spread uniformly across its entire extent .",
    "similarly , a `` nanobreaker '' could be realized with the help of vacancies , whose aggregation will result in the loss of mechanical stability of the graphene sheet .",
