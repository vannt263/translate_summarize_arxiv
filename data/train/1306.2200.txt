    "in compton scattering @xmath1 , the electric and magnetic fields of a real photon induce radiation multipoles by displacing the charged constituents and currents inside the target .",
    "the energy- and angle - dependence of the emitted radiation explores the interactions of its constituents . in hadronic physics , it elucidates the distribution , symmetries and dynamics of the charges and currents which constitute the low - energy degrees of freedom inside the nucleon , and  for few - nucleon systems  the interactions between nucleons ; see a recent review for details  @xcite .",
    "the 2007 nsac and 2010 nupecc long - range plans emphasise therefore the pivotal rle of the nucleon s temporal two - photon response below @xmath2gev to complement the information accessible in one - photon experiments like form - factor measurements . as a consequence ,",
    "a number of experiments are presently being pursued at mami ( mainz )  @xcite , hi@xmath3s at tunl  @xcite , and max - lab at lund  @xcite .",
    "for the next generation , aron bernstein and rory miskimen have shown at this workshop how to use high - intensity electron beams like mesa for `` near - real '' photon experiments  @xcite .",
    "in contradistinction to many electro - magnetic processes , such structure effects have only recently been subjected to a multipole - analysis .",
    "the fourier transforms of the corresponding temporal response functions are the proportionality constants between incident field and induced multipole .",
    "these _ energy - dependent polarisabilities _ parametrise the stiffness of the nucleon @xmath4 ( spin @xmath5 ) against transitions @xmath6 of given photon multipolarity at fixed frequency @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ; @xmath9 ; @xmath10 ; @xmath11 ) . up to @xmath0 , the relevant terms are : @xmath12\\;n \\end{split}\\ ] ] the two spin - independent polarisabilities @xmath13 and @xmath14 parametrise electric and magnetic dipole transitions . of particular interest",
    "are at present the four dipole spin - polarisabilities @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "they encode the response of the nucleon spin - structure , i.e.  of the spin constituents .",
    "intuitively interpreted , the electromagnetic field associated with the spin degrees causes bi - refringence in the nucleon , just like in the classical faraday - effect .",
    "only the linear combinations @xmath19 and @xmath20 of scattering under @xmath21 and @xmath22 are somewhat constrained by data or phenomenology , with conflicting results for the proton ( mami , legs ) and large error - bars for the neutron .",
    "the values @xmath23 etc . are often called `` the ( static ) polarisabilities '' ; but the @xmath7-dependence reveals more . since the polarisabilities are the parameters of a multipole decomposition , they contain not more information than the full amplitudes , but characteristic signatures in specific channels are easier to interpret .",
    "for example , the significant @xmath7-dependence of @xmath14 and @xmath16 already for @xmath24 comes from the strong para - magnetic @xmath25 transition .",
    "the @xmath26 enters thus dynamically well below the resonance region .",
    "the electric polarisabilities exhibit a pronounced cusp at the pion - production threshold .",
    "as soon as an inelastic channel opens , polarisabilities become complex . thus",
    ", their imaginary parts provide an alternative to explore pion - photoproduction multipoles .",
    "polarisabilities also enter as one of the bigger sources of uncertainties in theoretical determinations of the proton - neutron mass difference ( see e.g.  most recently @xcite ) , and of the two - photon - exchange contribution to the lamb shift in muonic hydrogen ( see e.g.  most recently @xcite ) .",
    "finally , nuclear targets provide an opportunity to study not only neutron polarisabilities , but also the nuclear force directly , since the photons couple to the charged pion - exchange currents in the nucleus .",
    "interpreting such data of course requires commensurate theoretical support . one must carefully evaluate data - consistency in one model - independent framework for hidden systematic errors ; subtract binding effects in few - nucleon systems ;",
    "extract the polarisabilities using minimal theoretical bias ; identify the underlying qcd mechanisms , like the detailed chiral dynamics of the pion cloud and of the @xmath26 resonance ; relate them to emerging lattice qcd simulations  and do all of that while providing reproducible theoretical uncertainties .",
    "@xmath27eft , the low - energy theory of qcd and extension of chiral perturbation theory to few - nucleon systems , has been quite successful in proton and few - nucleon compton scattering , starting with the parameter - free leading - order prediction @xmath28 by bernard et al .",
    "@xmath27eftgenerates the most general compton amplitude consistent with gauge invariance , the pattern of chiral - symmetry breaking in qcd , and lorentz covariance .",
    "a particularly interesting @xmath27eftprediction is that small proton - neutron differences in polarisabilities stem from chiral - symmetry breaking @xmath29n interactions and thus probe details of qcd . in @xmath27eftwith",
    "explicit @xmath26 degrees of freedom , the low - energy scales are the pion mass @xmath30 as the typical chiral scale ; the delta - nucleon mass splitting @xmath31 ; and the photon energy @xmath7 . when measured in units of a natural `` high '' scale @xmath32 at which this variant can be expected to break down",
    "because new degrees of freedom become dynamical , each gives rise to a small , dimensionless expansion parameter . in the @xmath33-expansion of pascalutsa and phillips  @xcite",
    ", one avoids a threefold expansion by approximately relating scales so that only one dimensionless parameter is left : @xmath34 i.e.  numerically @xmath35 . for @xmath36 ,",
    "the thomson amplitude is leading - order , @xmath37 ; structure effects start with @xmath29n loops at @xmath38 ; and since @xmath39 whereas @xmath40 , @xmath41 loops are suppressed by an additional power to @xmath42 .",
    "the delta - pole graph is @xmath42 for @xmath43 , but its enhancement close to the delta s on - shell point leads to a re - ordering of contributions at higher energies , @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath45 loops that generate the resonance s nonzero width must then be resummed . in this rgime ,",
    "the dominant compton mechanism , @xmath46 , is the excitation of a dressed @xmath26 by the magnetic transition from the nucleon , followed by de - excitation via the same m1 transition .",
    "the e2 @xmath47 transition and leading - one - loop corrections to the @xmath48 vertex enter at @xmath49 .",
    "relativistic kinematics is of course essential around the @xmath50 resonance .",
    "recently , single - nucleon compton amplitudes were derived which apply from zero energy to about @xmath51 . for @xmath52",
    ", they contain all contributions at @xmath53 ( n@xmath54lo , accuracy @xmath55 ) , and for @xmath56 all at @xmath57 ( nlo , accuracy @xmath58 ) ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "vladimir pascalutsa s talk presented results of an alternative , manifestly covariant @xmath27eftvariant  @xcite .    for light nuclei",
    ", @xmath27eft provides at present deuteron compton scattering results which are complete at @xmath59 from the thomson limit up to about @xmath60  mev , including the @xmath26 degree of freedom  @xcite .",
    "this is now being extended both to higher energies and by including the new single - nucleon amplitudes .",
    "for @xmath61he , the results in a variant without explicit @xmath26 and for @xmath62\\;{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{mev}}}$ ]  @xcite are extended , too . in few - nucleon systems ,",
    "the thomson limit as exact low - energy theorem is a result of @xmath63 rescattering between photon emission and absorption . while computationally intensive , its rle diminishes for @xmath24 because the photon does not scatter any more coherently from the target nucleus as a whole .",
    "finally , nuclei themselves are made of charged particles which are displaced by the photon fields and thus have an intrinsic polarisability .",
    "for the deuteron , these are known on the @xmath64-level , with various eft variants and conventional calculations agreeing very well  @xcite .",
    "in the unified single - nucleon amplitudes described above , the @xmath29n parameters take their standard values  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath26 parameters @xmath65  mev and @xmath66 are obtained from the breit - wigner peak and width via the relativistic formula , and the ratio of e2 and m1 couplings is @xmath67 .",
    "two contact interactions encode the short - distance ( @xmath68 ) contributions to the scalar polarisabilities .",
    "their coefficients ( or , equivalently , the static values @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) must be fitted . to that end",
    ", one must first establish a statistically consistent database from all available proton data below @xmath71 in ref .",
    "@xcite , carefully pruning the data by objective and transparent criteria .",
    "since the power counting confirms that the high - energy amplitudes are most sensitive to @xmath50 parameters , the @xmath3n@xmath50 m1 coupling @xmath72 is determined from the mami data for @xmath73200325  mev .",
    "sensitivity to the polarisabilities is greater at @xmath74  mev , where the amplitudes are also known with higher accuracy .",
    "thus , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are fit concurrently to these low - energy data , with iteration betwixt both regions until convergence is reached .",
    "one finds a solution with a @xmath77 , @xmath78 and the static scalar proton polarisabilities as ( stat .",

    "all fits are stable under reasonable variations in the procedure and agree with the data well beyond the region in which the parameters are determined .",
    "special care has been taken to reproducibly justify a theoretical uncertainty of @xmath82 from the most conservative of several estimates of higher - order terms . for an acceptable fit ,",
    "@xmath83 is treated as parameter , albeit its counter term enters at higher order .",
    "neutron polarisabilities are extracted from the elastic deuteron data base of ref .",
    "it has significantly larger statistical error - bars and is only a tenth of the size of the proton one , with data at only a few angles and energies @xmath84\\;{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{mev}}}$ ] .",
    "these amplitudes are one order lower than in the proton extraction , but the statistical errors are still larger than the estimated theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the correct thomson limit and @xmath63 rescattering is important also to reduce residual dependence on the choice of the deuteron wave function to @xmath85%  @xcite .",
    "the fit to the isoscalar , scalar dipole polarisabilities yields with @xmath86 : @xmath87    \\times10^{-4}\\;{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{fm}}}^3    & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!,\\!\\!\\!\\ ! &    { \\ensuremath{\\beta_{m1}^{(\\mathrm{s})}}}=    [ 3.6\\mp0.9_\\mathrm{stat}\\pm0.2_\\mathrm{baldin}\\mp0.8_\\mathrm{theory } ]    \\times10^{-4}\\;{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{fm}}}^3\\;\\;\\;\\;\\\\ { \\ensuremath{\\alpha_{e1}^{(\\mathrm{n})}}}= [ 11.1\\pm 1.8_\\mathrm{stat}\\pm0.2_\\mathrm{baldin}\\pm0.8_\\mathrm{theory } ]    \\times10^{-4}\\;{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{fm}}}^3   & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!,\\!\\!\\!\\ ! & { \\ensuremath{\\beta_{m1}^{(\\mathrm{n})}}}= [ 4.2\\mp 1.8_\\mathrm{stat}\\pm0.2_\\mathrm{baldin}\\mp0.8_\\mathrm{theory } ]    \\times10^{-4}\\;{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{fm}}}^3\\;\\;\\;\\;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath79 ellipsoid is again the statistical error . in the last line , the proton and isoscalar values",
    "are combined to the static scalar neutron polarisabilities .",
    "an independent fit to @xmath88 and @xmath89 is again consistent with the ( isoscalar ) baldin sum rule , so this constraint reduces statistical uncertainties .",
    "in contrast to the proton case , the data are consistent : each experiment contributes roughly equally to the @xmath90 , and the extracted polarisabilities are largely insensitive to the elimination of any one data set . within the statistics - dominated errors ,",
    "the proton and neutron polarisabilities are thus identical , i.e.  no isospin breaking effects of the pion cloud are seen , as predicted by chiral eft . in all cases ,",
    "the normalisation of each data set is floated within the quoted normalisation uncertainty ; refs .  @xcite",
    "give more details .",
    "the future lies in un- , single- and double - polarised experiments of high accuracy , with reproducible systematic uncertainties ; see  @xcite for ongoing and planned efforts . for unpolarised experiments on the proton ,",
    "the greatest impact is where the data base of nearly @xmath91 points is most scarce : ( 1 ) at forward angles ( test the baldin sum rule ) ; ( 2 ) at extreme back - angles ( test @xmath92 ) ; ( 3 ) between @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( sparse and inconsistent data ) ; ( 4 ) to resolve the several-@xmath95 discrepancy between legs and mami which prevents a consistent fit to all sets simultaneously  @xcite .    in order to understand the subtle differences of the pion clouds around the proton and neutron induced by explicit chiral symmetry breaking in qcd , we need the neutron polarisabilities with uncertainties comparable to those of the proton .",
    "maxlab and hi@xmath3sare aiming to augment the angular and energy range of the @xmath96 unpolarised data points for the deuteron with statistical and systematic uncertainties of better than @xmath97 .",
    "both also have plans for @xmath61he .",
    "first results on unpolarised @xmath98li have been reported , and theory is starting to catch up  @xcite .",
    "such targets are experimentally better to handle and provide count rates which scale at least linearly with the target charge when photons scatter incoherently from the protons , i.e.  @xmath24 .",
    "however , describing the energy levels of these nuclei with adequate accuracy is theoretically involved . for the proton ,",
    "amplitudes on the @xmath99-level are available ; for deuteron and @xmath61he , consistent compton amplitudes from zero energy into the delta resonance region are being developed in @xmath27eft . around @xmath61he-@xmath100he-@xmath98li",
    "may well be the `` sweet - spot '' between needs and wants of theorists and experimentalists .",
    "neutron values can also be isolated both in quasi - free kinematics and from polarised @xmath61he , which effectively is a free - neutron target  @xcite",
    ".    the highest impact of high - intensity ( near - real ) photon beam machines will however be in the study of the so - far nearly untested spin - polarisabilities : four each for the proton and neutron . since they test the spin - constituents of the nucleon , they are a top priority of experiment and theory alike .",
    "sensitivity studies have been performed in @xmath27eftvariants with and without explicit @xmath26 ; see summary in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "6.1 ) and v.  pascalutsa s talk for a covariant @xmath27eftvariant  @xcite .",
    "asymmetries remove many systematic effects .",
    "recently , the cross section with arbitrary photon and deuteron polarisation has for example been parametrised via 18 independent observables  @xcite .",
    "an exploration of the sensitivity of each on the nucleon s scalar and spin dipole polarisabilities in the @xmath27eftvariant discussed above shows that some asymmetries are sensitive to only one or two dipole polarisabilities .",
    "this makes them particularly attractive for an energy - dependent multipole - expansion of compton scattering ; cf .",
    "@xcite . for spin polarisabilities with an error of @xmath101 ,",
    "asymmetries should be measured with an accuracy of @xmath102 , with differential cross sections of a dozen nb / sr at @xmath103 or a few dozen nb / sr at @xmath104 . relative to single - nucleon compton scattering , interference with the @xmath105 wave and the pion - exchange current of the deuteron increases the sensitivity to the `` mixed '' spin polarisabilities @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
