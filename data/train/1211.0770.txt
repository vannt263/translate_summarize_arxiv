    "<S> we show a purely electronic cooling scheme to cool a charged mechanical resonator ( mr ) down to nearly the vibrational ground state by elaborately tuning bias gate voltages on the electrodes , which couple the mr by coulomb interaction . the key step is the modification of time - dependent effective eigen - frequency of the mr based on the lewis - riesenfeld invariant . with respect to a relevant idea proposed previously [ li _ et al_. , phys . rev . </S>",
    "<S> a * 83 * , 043803 ( 2011 ) ] , our scheme is simpler , more practical and completely within the reach of current technology .    micro- and nano - mechanical resonators ( mrs ) have attracted much research interest due to their combination of both classical and quantum properties @xcite together with broad impact on fundamental researches and applications @xcite , such as ultra - sensitive measurements approaching quantum limit @xcite , observation of continuous - variable entanglement with mesoscopic objects  pra-84 - 024301,prl-101 - 200503 , quantum information processing  prl-105 - 220501 , and biological sensing @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the prerequisite of the research in these aspects is to cool the mrs down to their ground states in order to suppress detrimental influence from thermal fluctuations . up to now , there have been many proposals for cooling the mrs @xcite in either optomechanical or electromechanical systems , in which the resolved sideband cooling method enables the vibrational ground - state cooling of mrs . </S>",
    "<S> so far , the ground - state cooling of mrs has been achieved experimentally nature-464 - 697 , nature-478 - 89 , natphys-5 - 485 , nature-463 - 72 .    </S>",
    "<S> very recently , a different approach to fast ground - state cooling of mrs has been proposed  @xcite with time - dependent optical driving in a three - mirror cavity optomechanical system , in which the effective frequency of the mr can be changed like an ` optical spring ' and the mr can be cooled down to nearly its ground- state under the control of time - dependent external optical driving fields . </S>",
    "<S> but the scheme seems challenging experimentally due to the requirement for both adiabatic evolution under born - oppenheimer approximation and very strong optical powers .     </S>",
    "<S> couples to two identical electrodes via coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the two electrodes are distant by @xmath0 and @xmath1 is the deviation of the mr from the equilibrium position . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is the capacitance of gate , and @xmath3 is the tunable bias gate voltage.,width=226 ]    we present in this work an alternative method using a purely electronic way , which is simpler but more practical , for cooling a charged mr by two electrodes via coulomb interaction . under the control of bias gate voltages </S>",
    "<S> , the mr behaves as a single - mode harmonic oscillator with its effective frequency tunable like an ` electrical spring ' . </S>",
    "<S> our method is somewhat similar to that given in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite but without involvement of born - oppenheimer approximation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in contrast to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , our idea is more feasible using current experimental techniques due to manipulation of bias gate voltages . furthermore , different from the traditional cooling schemes in electromechanical systems based on superconductor qubits @xcite or microwave photons prb-78 - 134301,prb-76 - 205302 , our scheme can cool a mr down to its vibrational ground state by simply tuning the bias gate voltages . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> this is the first cooling scheme with purely electronic way to cool the mr system without any assistance from auxiliary qubits or additional photons .    as schematically shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig b1 ] , we consider a system where a charged mr is placed in the middle of two identical electrodes , and couples electrostatically to these two electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> each electrode takes the charge @xmath4 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 being the capacitance and voltage of the bias gate , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb force between the mr and each electrode varies with the bias gate voltage , and the coulomb potential is written by @xmath5where @xmath6 is the equilibrium separation between the mr center - of - mass position and the electrodes with @xmath1 the deviation of the mr from the equilibrium position , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the coulomb constant in vacuum with @xmath9 being the vacuum dielectric constant , and @xmath10 is the charge of the mr .    after defining @xmath11 with the dimensionless time - dependent factor @xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> satisfying @xmath13 , we may reduce eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ c1 - 1 ] ) , under the condition of @xmath14 , to @xmath15where the term @xmath16 has been ignored since it commutes with both the position and the momentum operators of the mr , and makes no contribution to following discussions .    </S>",
    "<S> supposing the charged mr in the absence of the electrodes takes the hamiltonian @xmath17where @xmath1 and @xmath18 are the position and momentum operators of the mr with the bare eigen - frequency @xmath19 and the effective mass @xmath20 , we have the modified hamiltonian under the control of the bias gate as @xmath21where the effective frequency is @xmath22 with @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> .    generally speaking , the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator ( e.g. mr ) governed by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ c1 - 3 ] ) can be obtained by the method of lewis - riesenfeld invariants @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , for some special intermediate trajectories , the instantaneous quantum state of the harmonic oscillator at initial time instant can be the same as that at the final time instant , although the effective eigen - frequency of the harmonic oscillator has been changed significantly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , we may have the final mean phonon number of the harmonic oscillator to be the same as the initial one , but with significant change of the effective temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this idea holds for arbitrary initial state , and has been used to cool the spatial motion of atoms @xcite and to cool the mr in cavity optomechanical system @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our present idea is to achieve cooling of the mr by modifying time - dependent eigen - frequency via tuning the bias gate voltages on external electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the effective frequency @xmath24 of the mr can be easily changed by tuning the bias gate voltages @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath25 can be much smaller than @xmath26 under negative @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath24 can be even imaginary in order to accelerate the cooling process  @xcite .    specifically , considering some experimentally achievable parameters in charged mr systems  @xcite , such as @xmath27n@xmath28m@xmath29c@xmath30 , @xmath31 khz , @xmath32 pg , @xmath33 @xmath34 m , @xmath35 v , @xmath36 , @xmath37/cm@xmath30 , @xmath39 nf , and @xmath40 @xmath34m@xmath30 , we have @xmath41 , meeting the approximate condition in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( vc - approx1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> similar to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , our protocol for cooling mr comprises following two steps . _ _ step i : decreasing the mean phonon number with the increase of the mr effective frequency__in the absence of bias gate voltages ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) , we assume the mr with eigen - frequency @xmath43 initially in a thermal equilibrium state @xmath44 at temperature @xmath45 mk . </S>",
    "<S> so the corresponding mean thermal phonon number is given by @xmath46 - 1\\right\\}\\simeq 3100.\\ ] ]    with an arbitrary trajectory of @xmath47 [ or @xmath48 , the mr is assumed to be in a new thermal state @xmath49,\\ ] ] at a later time @xmath50 with @xmath51 , where the effective frequency is @xmath52 and the mean thermal phonon number is @xmath53 - 1}% \\simeq 0.47.\\ ] ]    it is clear that the temperature of the mr at the time @xmath50 remains unchanged compared with the initial one , while the mean thermal phonon number of the mr is much less than the one at the initial time @xmath54 due to enlargement of the effective frequency @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact @xmath55 means that the mr with enlarged effective frequency has been cooled down to nearly the vibrational ground state . </S>",
    "<S> _ _ step ii : decreasing the mr effective frequency by keeping the low mean phonon number__this step is accomplished via a special trajectory of @xmath56 evolving to the final time @xmath57 under the control of bias gate voltages satisfying two conditions : i ) the final effective frequency is equal to the bare one ( i.e. , @xmath58 ) , implying that the bias gate voltages are absent again at the final time @xmath57 ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) ; ii ) during the cooling process , the mean phonon number remains unchanged compared with that at time @xmath50 ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we have the mr with the bare frequency cooled to nearly the vibrational ground state .    </S>",
    "<S> the solution to such a special trajectory of @xmath56 between @xmath50 and @xmath61 governed by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ c1 - 3 ] ) follows the lewis - riesenfeld invariant @xcite . using the inverse - invariant method @xcite in appendix </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the control function of the trajectory of @xmath56 by tracing the lewis - riesenfeld invariant , @xmath62 where the dimensionless function @xmath63 is defined in appendix .    </S>",
    "<S> the trajectory of @xmath56 , starting from @xmath64 and ending with @xmath65 , corresponds to the effective frequency of the mr decreasing from the end frequency in the first step ( @xmath66 ) to the final frequency @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> we plot in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig b2 ] the control function @xmath56 , the corresponding instantaneous eigen - frequency @xmath68 and the effective temperature @xmath69 .              </S>",
    "<S> using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) , we know that our cooling enables the mr from the initial temperature @xmath70 mk down to the final temperature @xmath71 @xmath34k , as plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig b2](c ) . here </S>",
    "<S> the effective temperature is defined through @xmath72 - 1\\}$ ] . to estimate the imperfection in the trajectory of @xmath56 , which corresponds to the experimental error in tunable bias gate voltages on electrodes , we give the trajectory of @xmath56 a ten percent fluctuation , i.e. , @xmath73 , as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig b3](a ) , and simulate in fig .  [ fig b3](b ) and ( c ) the changes of the instantaneous eigen - frequency @xmath74 of the mr and the corresponding effective temperature of the mr . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , although the experimental deviation is as large as @xmath75 , the effective eigen - frequency can still reach @xmath76 for @xmath77 ( @xmath78 for @xmath79 ) deviation with the corresponding effective temperature 7 @xmath34k for @xmath77 ( 5 @xmath34k for @xmath79 ) deviation . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the mr in such cases can still be cooled down to nearly its vibrational ground state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we note that the final effective temperature 5 @xmath80k for @xmath79 deviation ( see fig .  [ fig b3](c ) ) seems lower than 6 @xmath80k under the ideal condition . but </S>",
    "<S> this is the case of fluctuation , which is uncontrollable . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in this deviating case , the effective frequency is @xmath81 , rather than the desired effective frequency @xmath26 . therefore , our choice of trajectory in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig b3](b ) is definitely optimal .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to point out that our scheme is only for an instantaneous cooling , which is different from the usual sideband cooling scheme achievable in steady state . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the mr is decoupled from electrodes at the end of our cooling process . </S>",
    "<S> so the mr can not be kept in low temperature for very long time but be heated again by environment . however , after the cooling , the mr would not return to the bath temperature suddenly due to its high q factor ( @xmath82 ) @xcite which makes sure the small decay of the mr . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , there should be a long enough time to finish the scheduled experimental works , such as quantum information processing  @xcite before the mr is heated to the bath temperature . </S>",
    "<S> even if the mr is thermalized to the bath temperature , we may repeat the same cooling process to put the mr down to the vibrational ground state again . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , both the cooling process and the experimental work should be done alternately in the implementation of the scheduled experimental works . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to that in ion trap system , wherein one carries out the sideband cooling and the operations of quantum algorithms alternately @xcite .    in summary , we have proposed a practical protocol for cooling a mr near to its vibrational ground state by controlling bias gate voltages on two nearby electrodes . using the achievable experimental parameters and considering experimental imperfection , we have shown the feasibility of the proposal by currently available technology . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> our work is not only a practical cooling scheme , but also very promising to verify the lewis - resisenfeld invariant method experimentally . </S>"
