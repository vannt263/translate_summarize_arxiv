    "there has been a great deal of recent interest in investigating the role of parity - time reversal ( @xmath0 ) symmetry in wave propagation at different scales with the discoveries of phenomena such as non - reciprocal beam propagation  @xcite , and uni - directionally transparent invisibility  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of topologically protected states  @xcite was originally discovered in condensed matter physics associated with electronic transport , but recently it has been demonstrated in optics  @xcite , due naturally to the correspondence between matter and optical waves .",
    "for example , topological photonics / acoustics were demonstrated by exploiting the analogy between electronic and synthetic photonic crystals , where tunable and topologically protected excitations were observed  @xcite .",
    "there were also efforts in exploring new wave features in artificial photonic crystals with / without the @xmath0-symmetry  @xcite .",
    "all these have led to the emergence of a forefront area of research in optics : light propagation in non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric media with balanced loss and gain profiles .",
    "the new field offers the possibility to engineer light propagation , potentially revolutionizing optics with unconventional applications .    in conventional quantum mechanics ,",
    "the observable operators are required to be hermitian to ensure real eigenvalues .",
    "this requirement is the result of one of the fundamental postulates in quantum mechanics : the physically observable or measurable quantities are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operators .",
    "however , the seminal works of bender _ et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated that non - hermitian hamiltonians are also capable of generating a purely real eigenvalue spectrum and therefore are physically meaningful , if the underlying system possesses a @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this opened a new research field called non - hermitian @xmath0 symmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , in physical systems , non - hermitian hamiltonians exist in contexts such as electronic transport ( in open hamiltonian systems ) and gain / loss materials in optics  @xcite . especially , in optics , materials with a complex index of refraction can effectively be a non - hermitian @xmath0 symmetric system  @xcite .",
    "however , in such a case , the @xmath0 symmetry constrictions require that the real and the imaginary parts of the refractive index be an even and odd function in space , respectively  @xcite , which may be challenging to be fabricated for experimental study .",
    "an alternative configuration that does not require even / odd spatial functions is the pseudo-@xmath0 symmetric system with periodic modulations  @xcite .",
    "while such a system does not conserve the energy at any given instant of time because of gain / loss , the energy does not diverge within any practically long time .",
    "an outstanding problem is how _ relativistic _ quantum effects manifest themselves in non - hermitian photonic systems with full or pseudo @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this is motivated by the tremendous development of 2d dirac materials in the past decade such as graphene  @xcite , topological insulators  @xcite , molybdenum disulfide ( mos@xmath1 )  @xcite , hitp [ ni@xmath2(hitp)@xmath1 ]  @xcite , and topological dirac semimetals  @xcite , where the underlying quantum physics is governed by the relativistic dirac equation .",
    "it is thus of interest to investigate experimentally more realizable optical systems hosting relativistic excitations and to study the manifestations of the fundamental phenomena  @xcite such as the klein tunneling , _ zitterbewegung _ ( zb ) , and pseudo spin to exploit their topological origin . in this",
    "regard , including gain / loss in synthetic optical systems can generate non - hermitian relativistic @xmath0-symmetric excitations through engineering the gain and loss in a balanced manner . for example , arranging @xmath0-symmetric couplers periodically provides a unique platform to realize the analogy of the non - hermitian relativistic quantum systems in optics  @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on a fundamental phenomenon in relativistic quantum mechanics - zb oscillations .",
    "while the optical analog of the relativistic zb effect in hermitian quantum systems was previously observed  @xcite , we investigate the manifestations of zb in non - hermitian photonic systems .",
    "in particular , we consider a binary waveguide array with periodically modulated imaginary refraction index in the guiding direction .",
    "this kind of time - periodic gain and loss photonic system is widely used in many theoretical and experimental works  @xcite .",
    "the optical waveguide array system , due to its controllable degrees of freedom , has been a paradigm to study a host of fundamental physical phenomena  @xcite such as the neutrino oscillations  @xcite , bloch oscillation  @xcite , zener tunneling  @xcite , and klein tunneling  @xcite .",
    "we configure the system to have a pseudo-@xmath0 symmetry , so that it exhibits quasi - stationary light propagation with slowly varying time - averaged total intensity  @xcite . by calculating a detailed phase diagram in an experimentally meaningful parameter space",
    ", we uncover a number of phenomena in the system .",
    "in particular , we find that , in certain parameter regime , the wave amplitude tends to diverge .",
    "a remarkable phenomenon is that there are parameter regimes in which the dependence of zb oscillations on the modulation frequency is non - monotonic , where the system exhibits a striking , periodically suppressed zb effect with revival or intermittent zb oscillations for low frequencies and a hermitian - like zb effect in the high frequency regime . in the intermediate frequency regime ,",
    "a surprising spatial energy localization behavior emerges . by solving the corresponding time - dependent dirac equation ,",
    "we obtain analytic results that provide explanations for the numerically observed , zb manifested phenomena .",
    "the findings have implications .",
    "for example , the wave divergence phenomenon may be exploited for applications in optical amplifier and lasing .",
    "intermittent bz oscillations can potentially lead to a new mechanism to manipulate / control light propagation .    before describing our results in detail ,",
    "we remark on the two unique aspects of our work .",
    "first , _ what results can be considered as constituting a highly nontrivial or unexpected general fundamental insight into the zb phenomenon for researchers working in this field ?",
    "_ photonic crystals allow researchers to build up classical simulators of quantum systems .",
    "for example , through engineering the gain / loss media , non - hermitian , pt - symmetric and non - relativistic quantum physics has been analogously realized using two sets of evanescently coupled waveguides  @xcite through non - reciprocal beam dynamics .",
    "most previous studies on the optical analogies of non - hermitian pt - symmetric quantum systems are nonrelativistic . quite recently",
    ", optical analogies of the hermitian relativistic dirac equation have been articulated , such as synthetic photonic graphene and photonic topological insulators .",
    "an outstanding issue concerns the pt - symmetry and the related physical effects in synthetic relativistic quantum systems .",
    "existing theoretical proposals  @xcite rely on an exact design of the gain - loss profile or a sophisticated strain - based control scheme for the given gain - loss configuration , leading to stationary , non - hermitian pt - symmetric systems .",
    "distinct from the existing works , our work reports a _",
    "dynamical _ scheme to optically realize time - dependent , pseudo - pt symmetric relativistic dirac equation , and we find the striking phenomenon of periodically suppressed and revival zb oscillations .",
    "this `` intermittent '' zb phenomenon is in sharp contrast to conventional zb oscillations with a constant amplitude .",
    "another aspect of our work lies in observing a resonance boundary between the pseudo - pt and pt - breaking regions .",
    "this kind of resonance boundary has been reported in previous works , between the conventional pt - symmetric region and pt - broken region  @xcite . here ,",
    "our results show that the boundary between the pseudo - pt region and pt - breaking region follows the similar behavior .",
    "second , _ are there potentially feasible experimental schemes ? _",
    "the answer is affirmative .",
    "experimentally , conventional non - hermitian pt - symmetry systems require that the real part of the effective potential to be an exactly even while the imaginary part be an exactly odd function in space .",
    "our system design _ relaxes _ these requirements and significantly expands the configuration range of the non - hermitian systems through introducing spatial modulation .",
    "the width of zb trembling is on the order of micrometer and the length of the waveguides is millimeters .",
    "concretely , our system can be realized in a waveguide array configuration similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the gain effect can be realized , for example , through doping of dye molecules such as rhodamine b ( emission at 627 nm , excitation at 554 nm - green laser ) .",
    "loss can be introduced using metals evaporated into the waveguides during the fabrication process .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we provide a detailed description of our photonic waveguide array system with pseudo @xmath0 symmetry , and derive the underlying dirac equation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] , we present our main results : phase diagrams , amplitude divergence , regular and revival zb oscillations , and spatial energy localization . in sec .  [ sec : conclusion ] , we summarize the main results and offer a discussion .",
    "certain details of the analytical derivation based on the relativistic quantum dirac equation are given in appendix .",
    "and @xmath4 , are interleaved with each other .",
    "the real parts of the refractive index for @xmath5 and @xmath4 are different , and their imaginary parts are small but have opposite signs .",
    "the distance between two adjacent waveguides is @xmath6 and they are coupled through constant strength @xmath7 .",
    "the imaginary part of the refractive index changes along the @xmath8 direction , mimicking a time dependent non - hermitian potential . ]",
    "we consider a two - dimensional binary photonic superlattice consisting of two kinds of interleaved waveguides , @xmath5 and @xmath4 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "the distance between two adjacent waveguides is @xmath6 and the coupling strength between them in the effective tight - binding hamiltonian is @xmath7 . due to the similarity between the optical and electronic waves ,",
    "an optical waveguide system can simulate the time evolution of the electronic wavefunction subject to an equivalent potential .",
    "if the real parts of the refractive index of the nearest neighboring waveguides have the same mismatch , the waveguide superlattice can simulate the behaviors of the finite - mass dirac equation .",
    "in particular , the dispersion relation of the lattice is a hyperbola about the edge of the first brillouin zone  @xcite , and the @xmath5 and @xmath4 sublattices can be regarded as corresponding to the two components of the spinor wavefunction underlying the dirac equation .",
    "when the incident angle of a wave packet is approximately the first bragg angle , for an initial group velocity close to that of the edge of the first brillouin zone , the optical system obeys the relativistic dirac equation .",
    "experimentally , it is difficult to realize a waveguide system with time - dependent refractive index .",
    "however , the @xmath8 direction represents effectively the time dimension .",
    "the two - dimensional binary photonic superlattice system is then completely equivalent to a time dependent , one - dimensional relativistic dirac system , making possible experimental studies of various relativistic quantum effects .",
    "we employ the tight - binding approximation to analyze the waveguide superlattice .",
    "the amplitude of the optical field is described by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the amplitude of the optical field in the @xmath11th waveguide , @xmath7 is the effective coupling constant , and @xmath12 is the propagation mismatch .",
    "we assume that the real part of the mismatch @xmath13 between the nearest neighboring waveguides is constant .",
    "the space dependence of @xmath14 is embedded in its imaginary part : @xmath15 , where @xmath13 and @xmath16 denote its real and imaginary parts , respectively , with @xmath17 being the ratio between them that characterizes the strength of gain / loss .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 is the frequency of spatial gain / loss modulation in the @xmath8-direction .",
    "equivalently , @xmath18 can be regarded as the frequency of the imaginary part of the time - varying potential for the corresponding quantum system that is fundamentally non - hermitian due to the imaginary potential .",
    "we note that , for a hermitian system , i.e. , a superlattice system with a purely real refractive index , previous works  @xcite showed the emergence of two minibands with the dispersion relation given by @xmath19 . for the wavevector along the @xmath20-direction",
    ", @xmath21 is close to @xmath22 and the quantities @xmath23 exhibit a hyperbola - like behavior with a gap of @xmath24 , which is similar to the electron and positron dispersion curves from the finite - mass dirac equation . for a general non - hermitian system , it is straightforward to show that the dispersion relation has the same form as that for a hermitian system ( see appendix ) , but there are two differences : ( a ) the quantity @xmath12 becomes complex and ( b ) the system is time dependent due to the external driving . in the limit of small imaginary part , the complex frequency in the dispersion relation possesses the following real part @xmath25 guaranteeing that our non - hermitian system can still retain the equivalence to the relativistic quantum system for a massive particle at the boundaries of the brillouin zone . this condition constricts the incident angle of the wave packet to be about @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the wavelength and @xmath28 is the refractive index of the substrate .",
    "we emphasize that this analogy holds only when the wave packet is located near the brillouin zone boundary .",
    "analogy in other regions would be affected by the dispersive effect of the waveguides .",
    "in fact , many experiments have shown that the analogy can hold up to hundred millimeters  @xcite .    to demonstrate the equivalence of the waveguide equation to the dirac equation ,",
    "we make the following substitutions  @xcite : @xmath29^t=[(-1)^na_{2n},i(-1)^na_{2n-1}].\\ ] ] from the periodicity and symmetry of the system , we see that a unit cell from sublattice @xmath5 combining with one from sublattice @xmath4 is effectively a unit cell that forms a dirac spinor .",
    "it is necessary to use the dimensionless continuous transverse coordinate @xmath30 to form a spatial derivative operator . with these considerations , we obtain the following equivalent one - dimensional dirac equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the pauli matrices .",
    "these considerations hold when @xmath12 is complex . comparing with the standard dirac equation , we note the following equivalence : @xmath33 i.e.",
    ", the coupling constant between the waveguides corresponds to the speed of light while the mismatch between the waveguides is equivalent to the mass of the underlying particle .",
    "indeed , as we can see from the dispersion relation of the superlattice , the band gap for the brillouin zone is also proportional to @xmath12 , corresponding to the dispersion relation of a massive relativistic quantum particle .    in our simulations , we assume that the initial optical field has the form @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a gaussian beam envelope .",
    "the superlattice is made of @xmath36 waveguides separated from each other with the distance @xmath37 , and the effective coupling rate is @xmath38 .",
    "the gaussian beam has the wavelength of @xmath39 with a spot size about @xmath40 .",
    "the modulation frequency is scaled by the factor @xmath41 and the lengths are normalized by @xmath6 .",
    "breaking phase , and the other region corresponds to the pseudo-@xmath0 phase .",
    "( a , b ) phase diagrams in the @xmath42 and @xmath43 parameter plane , respectively .",
    "the color is coded in terms of the logarithm of the maximum intensity in the specific parameter region .",
    "the white lines in ( a ) denote the positions of the valleys in the oscillatory variations of the boundary .",
    "the first two vertical lines , counted from right to left , correspond to the two sets of parameters shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oscillation ] .",
    "the red stars in ( a ) specify the positions of the parameters shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zb ] . for each phase diagram ,",
    "the computational grid in the corresponding parameter plane has the size @xmath44 .",
    "the parameters are @xmath45 ( a ) and @xmath46 ( b ) . ]    to ascertain the emergence of the pseudo-@xmath0 symmetry , we probe into the parameter space of the photonic superlattice system systematically by calculating the phase diagrams .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] , where the same initial wave packet with a group velocity determined by the relativistic dirac point is used for different parameter combinations .",
    "the evolution is simulated for a relatively long time to ensure that the system has settled into a steady state .",
    "figures  [ fig : pd](a ) and [ fig : pd](b ) show the phase diagrams in the @xmath42 and @xmath43 parameter planes , respectively .",
    "the color is coded in terms of the maximum value of the intensity of the optical field for the corresponding parameters .",
    "considering the fact that , in the pure gain regime , the intensity grows exponentially , we use a logarithmic function to rescale the intensity for better visualization .",
    "we set a cut - off intensity level beyond which the optical field is deemed to have diverged , corresponding to the @xmath0 breaking case .",
    "the cut - off criterion we used is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the maximum of the total intensity and @xmath49 is the total intensity when there is no modulation . even for this relatively high cut - off intensity , there is little change in the shape of the boundary . in most parts of the boundary of the @xmath0 breaking phase and the pseudo-@xmath0 phase ,",
    "the change in the color from red to blue are quite rapid . in figs .",
    "[ fig : pd](a ) and [ fig : pd](b ) , the divergent regions are coded as dark red . for a small modulation frequency ,",
    "a number of waveguides absorb energy within the simulation time so that their intensity can exceed the cut - off value . for such waveguides ,",
    "a pseudo-@xmath0 behavior can not be numerically detected .",
    "because of this , there is a persistently red region in the phase diagrams when the modulation frequency is close to zero . from fig .",
    "[ fig : pd](a ) , we see that a pseudo-@xmath0 behavior exists either in the parameter region with small gain / loss strength or in the region with a high modulation frequency .",
    "the reason is that , when the gain / loss of the waveguides is small , energy absorption is insignificant so that the waveguides will have sufficient time to transfer the energy within the superlattice and dissipate the absorbed energy into the adjacent waveguides . when the modulation frequency is high , the period becomes small so that the waveguides are able to dissipate the absorbed energy through itself when the imaginary part of the refractive index changes its sign during light propagation .",
    "in general , the stronger the gain / loss strength , the higher the modulation frequency is needed to balance the gain and loss , providing an explanation for the shape of the boundary of the two regions in the high modulation frequency regime in the phase diagrams .",
    "figure  [ fig : pd](b ) exhibits a similar behavior , i.e. , the pseudo-@xmath0 behavior exists in the larger real refractive index ( corresponding to weaker gain and loss effects ) and higher modulation frequency regions .",
    "a general feature is that higher modulation frequency is favorable for the emergence of the pseudo-@xmath0 symmetry .    a phenomenon present in both figs .",
    "[ fig : pd](a , b ) is that the boundary of the pseudo-@xmath0 symmetric and the non pseudo-@xmath0 regions exhibits oscillatory variations as the modulation frequency is changed . for @xmath50 ,",
    "the system exhibits a divergent behavior even for the small gain / loss strength . to understand the origin of the boundary variations , we examine the details of the time evolutions of the system . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd](a ) , we mark the positions of the valleys in the variation with white lines , which are @xmath51 and @xmath52 , leading to the ratio of the period , i.e. , @xmath53 , to be about @xmath54 , indicating that the system tends to diverge when the modulation period is odd times of the rightmost line .",
    "when the ratio is even , the system tends to stay in the pseudo-@xmath0 phase .",
    "here we want to emphasis that this kind of resonance boundary has been extensively studied in the conventional pt - symmetric system  @xcite",
    ". however , when the ratio becomes large , it is hard to observe the oscillatory behavior , due mainly to the finite resolution of the simulation .",
    "another reason is that the system tends to shift into the high energy regime when the modulation frequency is low , so the oscillations are buried in the regime that does not correspond to @xmath0 breaking .",
    "the boundary in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd](b ) exhibits a similar variational behavior .",
    "particularly , as @xmath13 becomes larger , the imaginary part becomes relatively less significant . as a result",
    ", the band gap and thus the zb trembling frequency is given by @xmath55 ( to be described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : zb ] ) .",
    "when the modulation frequency is equal to the zb trembling frequency , a resonant effect appears , forming a pseudo-@xmath0 phase boundary that starts from @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd](b ) .",
    "the specific ratio relation suggests the occurrence of resonances in the system that can enhance or suppress the gain and loss of the superlattice .",
    "a more detailed understanding can be obtained through the dynamical oscillations in the system , i.e. , the zb effect .",
    "zb is a purely relativistic quantum effect resulting from the interference between the positive and negative energy states of the dirac fermion . to experimentally observe zb in electronic systems",
    "is challenging due to the small wavelength and the extremely high oscillating frequency .",
    "photonic superlattice systems with the underlying equation having the same mathematical form as the dirac equation provide an alternative paradigm for detecting and characterizing the zb phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to investigate whether zb can emerge in pseudo-@xmath0 symmetric photonic systems .",
    "figure  [ fig : zb ] shows a number of representative time series of the beam center of mass of the wave packet for different parameters .",
    "there are apparent oscillations in the time series .",
    "since oscillations are a generic feature of the wave equations , the issue is whether these oscillations are true manifestations of zb .",
    "we address this issue by analyzing the equivalent dirac equation to determine if the oscillations have a relativistic quantum origin .",
    "the basic idea is to write the dirac equation in the momentum space to obtain the time evolution of the wavefunction  @xcite . in order to arrive at an analytical form",
    ", we make the assumption that the total hamiltonian at any two given instants of times are commutative so that a sophisticated treatment of the time ordering operator is not necessary .",
    "note that , while for time independent quantum systems time ordering is not necessary , for a time dependent hamiltonian this may not be the case .",
    "nonetheless , we expect that , in the parameter regime where the non - hermitian effect is weak , i.e. , small @xmath16 , our analytic results would agree with the direct simulations results .    the main results of our analysis can be summarized by dividing the time evolution of the expectation value of the position operator into three components : the drift @xmath57 , the zb trembling component @xmath58 , and the purely imaginary component @xmath59 .",
