    "the intuitive geometric meaning of enlargeability is naturally captured by concepts of coarse topology , in particular by the notion of macroscopic largeness .",

    "is called _ enlargeable _ if for every @xmath4 there is a covering space @xmath5 that admits an @xmath6-contracting map @xmath7 to the @xmath3-sphere with its canonical metric , which is constant outside a compact set , and is of nonzero degree .    here",
    "all covering spaces @xmath8 are given the pullback metrics induced by an arbitrary metric on @xmath2 .",
    "the choice of metric on @xmath2 matters only in that it has to be independent of @xmath6 .",
    "a variation on this definition is obtained by restricting the kind of covering space allowed for @xmath8 .",
    "we shall call @xmath2 _ universally enlargeable _ if it is enlargeable and for all @xmath6 the covering @xmath8 can be taken to be the universal covering @xmath9 .",
    "we shall call @xmath2 _ compactly enlargeable _ if it is enlargeable and all @xmath8 can be taken to be compact , equivalently to be finite - sheeted coverings .",
    "recall that gromov  @xcite called a closed oriented manifold @xmath2 _ essential _ if its fundamental class maps non - trivially to the rational homology of @xmath10 under the classifying map of its universal cover .",

    "in fact , gromov suggested various versions of macroscopic largeness in  @xcite , and this definition , taken from  @xcite , is just one particular way of formalizing the concept .",

    "after we achieved this goal by finding the proof of theorem  [ t : first ] given in section  [ proof1 ] below , it turned out that the sophisticated methods of  @xcite can also be adapted to the consideration of infinite covers  @xcite .    while the ideas involved in our proof of theorem  [ t : first ] are indeed geometric and elementary , they do fit naturally into the framework of coarse homology , which we recall in section  [ homology ] following the books  @xcite .",
    "our argument makes essential use of the coarse space @xmath16 this balloon space , sketched in figure  [ fig : connectedballoons ] , is a coarse analogue of the one - point union .",

    "however , our proof of theorem  [ main ] will bypass this issue .    in the spin case ,",
    "theorem  [ main ] essentially shows that the gromov ",
    "lawson obstruction  @xcite to the existence of positive scalar curvature provided by enlargeability is subsumed by the index - theoretic obstruction @xmath34 , and even by @xmath33 .",

    "* theorem  1.2 ) and  @xcite .",
    "our result here neither implies nor is it implied by that of  @xcite . on the one hand , the canonical map @xmath48 is not always injective , so that our conclusion here is stronger than the one in  @xcite . on the other hand",

    "we slightly generalize this concept by considering the following amalgamation of enlargeability and @xmath0-theoretic essentialness :    [ d : aenl ] a closed @xmath27-manifold @xmath2 is called _ @xmath0-theory enlargeable _ if there is an @xmath51 such that for every @xmath4 there is a covering space @xmath5 that admits an @xmath6-contracting map @xmath7 to the @xmath3-sphere with its canonical metric , which maps the complement of a compact set to the base point ( equal to the south pole , say ) @xmath52 , and sends the @xmath0-theoretic orientation class to a non - trivial element of @xmath53 .    when @xmath3 is the dimension of @xmath2 , this definition reduces to definition  [ d : enl ] .",
    "we shall prove the following generalization of theorem  [ main ] :    [ t : main ] every @xmath0-theory enlargeable @xmath27-manifold is baum - connes essential .",
    "note that in addition to considering @xmath0-theory enlargeability , we now also allow arbitrary covering spaces in the definition of enlargeability , whereas in theorem  [ main ] we only used the universal covering .",
    "if the @xmath27 structure under consideration is induced by a spin structure , then the image of the @xmath0-theoretic fundamental class under @xmath49 is given by the @xmath50-genus of a regular fiber , and @xmath0-theory enlargeability reduces to @xmath50-enlargeability in the sense of gromov and lawson .",
    "the conclusion of theorem  [ t : main ] means that @xmath54 does not vanish .",
    "_ a fortiori _ the real index @xmath34 does not vanish either , so that the obstruction to the existence of a positive scalar curvature metric on @xmath2 provided by @xmath50-enlargeability is completely subsumed by @xmath34 .",
    "just like theorem  [ main ] , we prove theorem  [ t : main ] unconditionally , without assuming any unproved version of the baum  connes conjecture .",
    "however , if the baum  connes conjecture does hold for @xmath44 , then the special case of this theorem for @xmath27-structures induced by spin structures can be derived from the result of stolz mentioned above , because @xmath50-enlargeability is preserved by stabilisation with the bott manifold .",
    "although theorem  [ main ] is a special case of theorem  [ t : main ] , we shall first give a proof of this special case using the same ideas as in the proof of theorem  [ t : first ] .",
    "then , in order to prove theorem  [ t : main ] in full generality , we will face serious additional complications explained in section  [ s : coarsecoeff ] below .",
    "the more straightforward proof we give for the special case of theorem  [ main ] does have another advantage in addition to its simplicity , which is that it allows us to derive the following :    [ c : psc ] if @xmath2 is universally enlargeable and its universal covering @xmath13 is spin , then @xmath13 does not admit a metric with uniformly positive scalar curvature which is quasi - isometric to a pullback metric from @xmath2 via the identity .    in the more general situation considered in theorem  [ t :",

    "lastly , let @xmath65 be a closed oriented manifold . fix a metric and a triangulation of @xmath2 .",
    "the sum of all the lifts ( with induced orientations ) of the @xmath3-simplices in @xmath2 with respect to the projection @xmath66 defines the locally finite fundamental class @xmath67_{lf } \\in h^{lf}_n(\\widetilde{m } ) \\ , .\\ ] ] note that there is a canonical map @xmath68 indeed , let @xmath69 be the maximal diameter of simplices in @xmath2 .",
