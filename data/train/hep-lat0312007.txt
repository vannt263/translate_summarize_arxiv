    "the spectroscopy of excited @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons is important for our understanding of qcd . moreover , as stressed recently by rosner  @xcite , @xmath5 states also have important applications to cp studies of neutral @xmath3 mesons by the identification of their flavour ( @xmath6 versus @xmath7 ) through the decay chain @xmath8 .",
    "hence narrow @xmath5 resonances will be valuable for this .    in the heavy quark limit , the @xmath9 meson , which we refer to as a ` @xmath3 ' meson , will be the ` hydrogen atom ' of qcd .",
    "since the meson is made from non - identical quarks , charge conjugation is not a good quantum number .",
    "states can be labelled by l@xmath10 , where the coupling of the light quark spin to the orbital angular momentum gives @xmath11 . in the heavy quark limit these states",
    "will be doubly degenerate since the heavy quark spin interaction can be neglected , so the p@xmath12 state will have @xmath13 while p@xmath14 has @xmath15 , _ etc . _    this spectrum has been studied comprehensively by lattice methods in the quenched approximation  @xcite with a rather coarse lattice spacing . with @xmath16 flavours of dynamical quark",
    ", sesam  @xcite have explored the p@xmath17 excited state .",
    "lattice studies using nrqcd have also explored the heavy - light spectrum for @xmath6 quarks , mainly using quenched lattices  @xcite .    in the heavy quark",
    "effective theory , the leading order is just the static limit . the next correction will be of order @xmath18 and will be relatively small for @xmath6 quarks , but larger for @xmath19 quarks .",
    "one way to predict the spectrum for @xmath6 quarks is to interpolate between charmed states , where the experimental spectrum is known , and the static limit obtained by lattice qcd assuming a dependence as @xmath18 .",
    "thus the splittings among @xmath3 mesons should be approximately 0.33 of those among the corresponding @xmath4 mesons .    the striking discovery that the @xmath20 states with @xmath21 and @xmath22 have very narrow widths  @xcite raises the question of whether the corresponding @xmath23 states will also be narrow .",
    "the main reason for the narrow width of @xmath24 mesons is that the transition to @xmath25 is not energetically allowed ( for the 2317 mev state ) or the state is close to threshold ( for the 2457 mev state ) .",
    "thus the only allowed hadronic decay proceeds via isospin - violation ( since @xmath26 ) to @xmath24@xmath27 and will have a very small width .",
    "likewise , if the equivalent @xmath1 states are close to or below the @xmath2 threshold , then they will be very narrow .",
    "one of our main tasks will be to determine the energy of these excited states as accurately as possible to check this .",
    "as well as exploring this issue of great interest to experiment , we determine the excited state spectrum of the heavy - light system as fully as possible .",
    "this will help the construction of phenomenological models and will shed light on questions such as whether there is an inversion of the level ordering ( with l@xmath28 lighter than l@xmath17 ) at larger l or for radial excitations as has been predicted  @xcite .",
    "we also compare with chiral models  @xcite .",
    "we investigate the heavy - light meson spectrum from lattice qcd using static heavy quarks .",
    "previous lattice studies have explored  @xcite the full spectrum ( _ i.e. _ s , p@xmath17 , p@xmath28 , d@xmath17 , d@xmath28 , f ) in quenched qcd .",
    "there has also been a recent determination of the p@xmath17 excitation energy in full qcd  @xcite .",
    "here we present a range of different lattice studies : with different spatial volumes , lattice spacings and light quark masses  see tables  [ tab_df ] ,  [ tab_qu ] .",
    "we follow the all - to - all methods used in the static - light lattice study of michael and peisa  @xcite . keeping their parameters",
    ", we first use a larger spatial size of lattice to check for finite size effects  q1 vs. q3 .",
    "we are also able to correct the assignments of d@xmath28 and d@xmath17 states in their work , see q1 and q2 in table  [ tab_qu ] .",
    "our major study involves using lattice configurations  @xcite which include @xmath16 flavours of sea - quark , with two different lattice spacings .",
    "we only use the unitary points , namely those with valence light quarks of the same mass as the sea quarks .",
    "the details are collected in table  [ tab_df ] .    .",
    "lattice results for the energies of @xmath0 states in units of @xmath29 for dynamical fermions with @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath29 is taken to be 0.525(25 ) fm . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have used lattice qcd to explore the spectrum of heavy - light mesons .",
    "our results are evaluated for static quarks but they are very relevant to @xmath6 quarks ( @xmath5 states ) as we have argued .",
    "we have concentrated our studies on light quarks which are of the mass of a strange quark , although we find that excitation energies are consistent with being independent of the light quark mass , and hence will apply also to light quarks which are @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    in our lattice studies ,",
    "we have pushed towards light sea quarks , towards small lattice spacing and towards large volume , but not towards all three requirements simultaneously .",
    "this leaves some room for systematic errors in our predictions .",
    "these can be reduced by further studies with increased computational resources .",
    "we have determined the spectrum up to f - waves and including radial excitations , see fig .",
    "[ spdffig ] .",
    "this gives a rich texture for model building of heavy - light mesons .",
    "we find no evidence of a sign change in the spin - orbit splitting of d - waves .",
    "thus conventional short - distance spin - orbit effects are still relevant up to radii appropriate for d - wave states . rather than the pattern given by chiral symmetry ( which relates s to p@xmath17 and d@xmath17 to p@xmath28 _ etc .",
    "_  @xcite ) we find a spectrum which is closer to being dependent on l alone .",
    "indeed we see an approximate linear rise in excitation energy with l , up to l=3 , as 0.45 l gev , reminiscent of regge or string models .",
    "we have discussed corrections to the heavy quark limit appropriate to @xmath5 states and have used experimental data on @xmath32 states to establish this .",
    "our results for the p - wave excitations confirm those obtained previously  @xcite that the excitation energies are relatively small .",
    "this implies that the @xmath1 p - wave states will be close to the lightest hadronic decay thresholds ( namely @xmath2 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "the p@xmath17 states ( @xmath34 ) have an s - wave decay but are light enough that there is little or no phase space for decay .",
    "the p@xmath28 states ( @xmath35 ) are heavier but have d - wave decays and so will also have narrow widths since centrifugal barrier effects will reduce them .",
    "we also see evidence that the 2s states ( @xmath36 ) are close to the lightest thresholds and so may be narrow too .",
    "our results for @xmath37 states are summarised in fig .",
    "[ qmfig ] and in table  [ tab_sum ] .",
    "this raises the prospect that there will be many ( up to 6 ) narrow excited @xmath38 states to be found experimentally .",
    "since we see no significant dependence of the excitation energies on light quark mass , our predictions from the table  [ tab_sum ] can also be used as estimates for orbital and radial @xmath39 excitation energies , although these mesons will not be especially narrow since the @xmath40 and @xmath41 thresholds are open .",
