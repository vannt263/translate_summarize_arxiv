    "modern intersections of chemistry , biology , and materials science focus attention on systems that are substantially nonuniform in their spatial organization ; examples include interfaces , structural elements of the cell such as the cytoskeleton , and systems undergoing phase transitions . tools of statistical mechanics that could help clarify their structure and function often do not apply straightforwardly or efficiently in the face of such heterogeneity .",
    "this paper concerns a class of computational methods that suffer in this way .    specifically , we address methods for simulating shape fluctuations of elastic materials . pioneered by parrinello and rahman@xcite in the context of molecular dynamics , these approaches extended constant pressure simulation techniques and@xcite , like their predecessors , opened the door for novel computational studies of phase transitions@xcite .",
    "the basic idea of these approaches is simple to understand : treat the parameters of a system s overall geometry as fluctuating dynamical variables , on the same footing as molecular coordinates . in practice , it is convenient to isolate changes in box size and shape by introducing scaled ( reduced ) coordinates , @xmath0 ( using einstein summation convention ) , where @xmath1 is the @xmath2-coordinate of the position vector of atom @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a matrix of @xmath5 lattice vectors defining the periodically replicated @xmath5-dimensional box geometry .",
    "parrinello and rahman constructed a lagrangian with fictitious terms involving @xmath4 and its time derivatives , allowing dynamical simulations of a system with fluctuating shape .",
    "one can similarly use monte carlo simulations to sample the components of @xmath4 from a boltzmann distribution@xcite .",
    "the problem with applying these methods to heterogeneous materials is also simple to understand .",
    "when @xmath4 changes , so do the physical positions of all atomic coordinates . for example , if one of the basis vectors in @xmath4 defining a rectangular simulation cell is scaled by some factor , the corresponding components of all position vectors @xmath6 become multiplied by the same factor .",
    "the stiffness of the resulting motion is determined by the resistance of molecular interactions to these scale and shear transformations .",
    "sampling efficiency is thus determined by the proverbial `` weakest link '' : if even a small part of the system strongly resists deformation , then a simulation must await rare , transiently softening fluctuations in local structure that facilitate changes in overall geometry .",
    "a system featuring many locally stiff regions becomes nearly intractable , since the likelihood of many rare local fluctuations occurring simultaneously is extremely small .    our attention to these methodological issues",
    "is driven by an interest in the polymer networks that determine elastic properties of living cells@xcite . as a crude but illustrative model of these cytoskeletal materials , consider a collection of semi - flexible filaments , placed and oriented at random on a two - dimensional plane , that are permanently cross - linked wherever they intersect@xcite . in this case spatial variations in cross - link density effect substantial variations in local stiffness .",
    "even modest global strains are typically not tolerated by the densest regions of the network .",
    "a monte carlo simulation of such a model could achieve a reasonable acceptance rate only by using very small displacements in system geometry . as a result",
    ", relaxation would proceed quite sluggishly .    in this paper",
    "we present a technique that can remove these difficulties by allowing heterogeneous deformations . by transforming only part of a system",
    ", we avoid hinging fluctuations of the system as a whole on its stiffest parts .",
    "we consider such motions as trial moves in a metropolis monte carlo scheme .",
    "we term these as `` slice moves '' , since they proceed by choosing slices of a system that deform , leaving the remainder of the system internally unaffected . in section [ slicesect ] ,",
    "we introduce the method in detail for both constant pressure ( @xmath7 ) simulations and constant stress simulations , paying careful attention to the requirement of detailed balance .",
    "we illustrate the method in section  [ simulationsect ] through application to the elasticity of crystals of 2-dimensional hard disks , and random networks of cross - linked semi - flexible polymers , and in section  [ conclusionsect ] we conclude .",
    "the basic flaw of conventional strain sampling techniques , when applied to nonuniform systems , is their global nature .",
    "we localize strain moves in monte carlo simulations by choosing thin slices of a system , outside of which intermolecular geometries are undisturbed .",
    "[ slice ] illustrates such a partial volume move . in this two - dimensional example , subvolumes to be deformed are defined by two intersecting swaths . as a trial move",
    ", we deform the region @xmath8 shared by both slices , producing a new subvolume geometry @xmath9 .",
    "the requirement that regions outside the two slices remain undeformed then uniquely determines transformations within the remaining slice regions ( i.e. , within one but not both swaths ) . by choosing the slices locations and widths at random , we can in effect sample around problematically rigid parts of a configuration .     transforms to @xmath9 , co - transforming the shaded areas .",
    "the rest of the simulation box remains unchanged ; the new periodically replicating simulation box boundaries are shown as dotted lines . ]",
    "algorithmically , such a `` slice move '' proceeds as follows :    1 .",
    "select a particle at random , whose position @xmath10 serves as an anchor for the primary deformation subvolume @xmath8 .",
    "2 .   select random parallelepipeds @xmath8 and @xmath9 defining initial and final geometries of the subvolume .",
    "3 .   determine additional parallelepipeds @xmath11 , @xmath12 , etc . ,",
    "that connect @xmath8 with its periodic images ( see fig .  [ periodic ] ) .",
    "these regions , together with @xmath8 , form the intersecting slices that will be deformed .",
    "repeat for @xmath9 .",
    "4 .   calculate each particle s position in the deformed trial state according to strains applied to the region in which it resides .",
    "5 .   evaluate the change in internal energy @xmath13 ( accounting for the change in periodic boundary conditions ) and the work @xmath14 associated with external forces .",
    "6 .   accept or reject the trial move with a probability determined by the total change in energy relative to @xmath15    we will describe two variants of such a trial move .",
    "the simpler version involves only the limited class of transformations that switch between rectangular system geometries , for which the shape matrices describing @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath16 , etc .",
    "are all diagonal .",
    "the more general , and in practice much more complicated version , includes the possibility of shear deformations as well .    different periodic images of a particle may move differently in the course of a partial volume move . detailing the algorithm",
    "is therefore greatly simplified by a careful and specific choice of images .",
    "[ periodic ] illustrates how we select among each particle s set of periodically replicated coordinates , according to the subvolume it occupies .",
    "first , we require that each subvolume ( @xmath8 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and the unperturbed region @xmath17 ) is not fragmented across system boundaries . since the subvolumes are themselves repeated in space , this criterion does not by itself uniquely specify a choice of particle images .",
    "we further choose that the un - fragmented regions are adjacent in a particular way : the subvolumes @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath17 must all contact the anchor point @xmath10 .",
    "note that this scheme results in a collection of particle coordinates that do not lie within the boundary of a single simulation cell .",
    "finally , we translate all particles uniformly so that the anchor point @xmath10 lies at the origin . while geometrically straightforward , this set of operations carries a nontrivial computational overhead .",

    "such a move effects a change in system volume and aspect ratio , but does not change the relative directions of lattice vectors defining periodic boundary conditions . here , we will take the box matrix @xmath4 to be purely diagonal , both before and after the distortion .",
    "simulations we are not restricted to choosing a rectangular box , but can choose any unit cell that is scaled by a vector @xmath18 ; the rectangular case was chosen here for notational convenience . ]    the width of initial and final slices , together with the slice origin , completely specify an instance of this partial volume move .",
    "we define @xmath19 as the length of subvolume @xmath8 in direction @xmath3 , and @xmath20 as its length in the trial configuration .",

    "we expect efficiency considerations to similarly favor the use of slice moves for other complex systems that exhibit heterogeneous elasticity . in most physical contexts of interest , evaluating changes in potential energy due to intermolecular interactions",
    "will make negligible even the greatest expense brought on by slice moves , namely , determining which subvolume each particle occupies when executing a deformation with non - rectangular slices .",
    "furthermore , rectangular slices should suffice for exploring many types of elasticity , e.g. in systems that are fluid ; assigning particles to rectangular subvolumes is numerically inconsequential compared to calculating interaction energies for all but the simplest systems .",
    "we have shown how volume moves in constant - pressure simulations and strain moves in constant - stress simulations can be performed locally , such that intermolecular arrangements in much of a system remain undisturbed .",
    "significant speedup of monte carlo simulations is expected for systems that are considerably nonuniform in stiffness .",
    "example simulation results confirm that physically important strain states previously inaccessible as a matter of practice can now be readily explored .    by facilitating spontaneous strain fluctuations , this methodological advance promises to greatly extend the purview of techniques that assess linear elastic response via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "additionally , it provides a new type of collective monte carlo move as an alternative to cluster moves@xcite .",
    "more broadly , it opens doors to applications in the many biophysical and materials contexts that involve spatially varying density ( as occurs in a material undergoing a phase transition ) and/or composition ( as is routine in living cells ) .",
    "this work is supported in part by the california institute for quantitative biosciences , and by the national science foundation .",
    "executing a slice move requires determining the set of particles that reside in each subvolume , before their coordinates can be appropriately transformed ( according to eq .",
    "[ newcoordrect ] or [ newcoordshear ] ) . performing this task efficiently is straightforward for subvolumes that are rectangular in the reduced coordinate space . for non - rectangular slices , however , it can become both awkward and costly . here",
    "we outline an algorithm that , for most points in a simulation box , reduces the classification problem to checking whether the point lies within a particular rectangle .",
    "the essence of this procedure is to inscribe a rectangle within each subvolume @xmath86 ( where @xmath146 in two dimensions ) .",
    "particle coordinates can be quickly checked against these rectangles .",
    "because useful deformation volumes tend to be small , most particles will fall within the inscribed rectangle of the undisturbed region @xmath17 .",
    "only a small fraction of particles need then be checked against subvolumes full parallelotope shapes .",
    "a systematic procedure for doing so is described below .",
    "consider a particle located at position @xmath147 in the reduced coordinate system , and a subvolume @xmath86 centered at position @xmath148 ( also in the reduced coordinate system ) with shape matrix @xmath149 .",
    "we first determine which of the particle s periodic images , whose position we denote @xmath150 , lies nearest @xmath148 .",
    "we then compute a new set of reduced coordinates , @xmath151 $ ] , referenced to the subvolume shape and translated so that the origin lies at @xmath148 .",
    "if @xmath152 for all @xmath153 , then the particle resides in @xmath86 . by ordering subvolumes according to size , and checking particle positions against the largest slices first , we can ensure that most particles are assigned without numerous repetitions of these transformations ."
