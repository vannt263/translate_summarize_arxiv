    "the discovery of the massive neutron star psr j1614 - 2230 has raised new challenges for theories of dense matter beyond nuclear saturation density .",

    "the core of a neutron star harbors a dense matter environment , which could be the site for strangeness containing matter , such as hyperons .",
    "though nuclear interactions in the saturation regime are well understood , one has to utilize neutron star observations to find clues about the physics of cold and dense matter beyond several times saturation density .",
    "any theory of ultra dense matter has to explain the recently observed large neutron star mass . according to existing models of dense matter , the presence of hyperons leads to a considerable softening of the equation of state ( eos ) , resulting in a corresponding reduction of the maximum mass of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "then the existing theories involving hyperons are in conflict with the large pulsar masses @xcite . on including hyperons , most relativistic models obtain maximum neutron star masses in the range @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , in exceptional cases , neutron stars with maximum masses larger than 2@xmath3 have been obtained , either by pushing the threshold for appearance of hyperons to higher densities , or due to strong hyperon vector repulsion @xcite .",

    "@xcite assumed a quark matter core in order to obtain massive stars .",
    "bonanno and sedrakian @xcite also modeled massive neutron stars with a hyperon and quark core using a fairly stiff eos and vector repulsion among quarks . in several studies ,",
    "the maximum neutron star masses obtained when including hyperons were not very different from those containing nucleons only @xcite . in more sophisticated models such as the brueckner - hartree - fock model , the maximum neutron star masses were generally found to be lower than @xmath5 which is in contradiction with observed pulsar masses @xcite .",
    "+ from the studies cited in the previous paragraph , it seems that the possible presence of hyperons in massive neutron stars is in many cases reconciled by incorporating large vector repulsion in an ad hoc way .",

    "however , the extrapolation of such properties to supranuclear densities presents uncertainties . in a previous paper @xcite , we investigated how the uncertainty in nuclear saturation properties , such as effective nucleon mass or nuclear compressibility , or hypernuclear properties , such as potential depths of hyperons in nuclear matter , could influence our conclusions about the presence of hyperons in the core of massive neutron stars . in this work ,",

    "we fit the @xmath6 meson hyperon couplings to the potential depths of hyperons in nuclear matter ( see @xcite for discussions ) .      in order to explain the large observed mass of psr j1614 - 2230 we might either introduce more particles and parameters into our rmf model , or reconsider the necessity of fixing them to the @xmath27 values . + from the quadratic mass formula for the mesons one obtains @xmath42 which is quite close to the ideal mixing angle @xmath43 @xcite .",

    "in fact , a larger @xmath75 potential is the more conservative choice as it gives a slightly smaller maximum mass .",

    "the maximum mass grows up to the value @xmath102 for @xmath59 .",

    "this has interesting consequences when we use these results to predict the maximally allowed strangeness fraction in maximum mass neutron stars . in an associated study @xcite , we applied the results from measurements of sub - threshold kaon production in heavy - ion collisions ( hic ) to study the implications on neutron star properties .",
    "it was found that the heavy - ion data and causality imply a firm upper limit on maximum mass of compact stars of 3 solar masses . substituting this value into the derived formula above",
    ", we can show that the strangeness fraction in a 2 @xmath3 star can not be more than : @xmath142 we also point out that for the eos compatible with the observed mass limit , the hyperon fraction in a canonical @xmath143 star is zero . only for small effective nucleon masses and values of @xmath44 above the su(6 ) value",
    "can a hyperon fraction of less than @xmath144 be reached .",
    "+ we have now found that we can reach the nuclear matter limit starting from a rmf model including hyperons and continuously changing the model parameters , instead of making a discrete `` on / off '' decision about whether to include or exclude hyperons .",
    "instead , we should take the position of saying that one can only exclude a rmf parameter set as soon as the corresponding maximum mass for nucleonic stars is incompatible with observations .",
    "as long as the observational mass limit is below the nucleonic mass limit of the model , it is possible to have hyperons in the core of maximum mass neutron stars .",
    "we investigated the conditions for the existence of hyperons in massive neutron stars .",
    "we went beyond the spin - flavor su(6 ) quark model for determining the vector meson couplings to the more general relations from flavor su(3 ) , where we varied the @xmath87 ratio @xmath44 and the f/(f+d ) ratio @xmath30 while assuming ideal mixing .",
    "+ we fixed either @xmath44 or @xmath30 to their su(6 ) values and allowed for a non - vanishing @xmath145 coupling .",
    "we found within `` model @xmath11 '' , that decreasing @xmath44 below its su(6 ) value leads to stiffer eos and larger maximum masses .",
    "the most massive stars were obtained for @xmath59 , where only the meson singlet couples to the baryon octet , meaning that all vector couplings take the same value .",
    "we have seen that at @xmath59 the masses of the stars come very close to the case of purely nucleonic neutron stars .",
    "+ keeping @xmath44 fixed at its su(6 ) value and varying @xmath30 has even a greater impact on the maximum masses of neutron stars : the lowest value is given for the su(6 ) case @xmath51 . towards @xmath127",
    "the maximum masses increase monotonically . in both cases ,",
    "i.e. on lowering @xmath44 and on lowering @xmath30 , we found that the combined repulsive interactions mediated by the @xmath7 and @xmath10 mesons cause the hyperons to appear at successively higher densities so that hyperons appear only in a small core ( @xmath59 , @xmath51 ) of the maximum mass star or not at all ( @xmath46 , @xmath127 ) .",
    "thus , the eos becomes stiffer and the strangeness fraction of neutron stars decreases with decreasing values of @xmath30 or z until the limit is reached where the whole sequence of neutron stars contains only pure nucleonic stars .",
    "there is a smooth transition between strange hadronic and nucleonic stars as well as between their corresponding maximum masses where formerly there was only an explicit inclusion / exclusion of hyperons in the construction of the model .",
    "this finding holds for all investigated parameter sets , but it should be stressed that the inclusion of the @xmath10 is vital for reaching the nuclear limit .",
    "we find that the maximum mass decreases linearly with the strangeness fraction @xmath0 of the neutron star core as @xmath1 , independent of the chosen nuclear eos and the adopted vector baryon - meson coupling scheme .",
    "for instance , given the mass of @xmath146 for a purely nucleonic neutron star , the strangeness fraction for a neutron star with an observed mass of @xmath147 would then be below @xmath148 .",
