    "since its introduction four decades ago , landau s fermi liquid theory has been the standard model for interacting many - fermion systems@xcite .",
    "the theory postulates that at low energies only the quasiparticle excitations play an essential role .",
    "the quasiparticles , essentially dressed fermions , can be adiabatically connected to certain non - interacting fermions as we turn off the interaction strength .",
    "the fermi liquid description has been successful not only for the weakly interacting electrons in simple metals , but also for strongly correlated fermion systems . in this latter category",
    "are liquid @xmath1@xcite for which the fermi liquid theory was initially formulated , and the metallic states of @xmath2 based compounds@xcite , the prototype material displaying the mott transition phenomenon@xcite .",
    "also included are the `` conventional '' heavy fermions@xcite such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , in which the mass of the quasiparticles are enhanced by as much as hundreds from the band - theory predictions .    in recent years",
    ", a number of strongly correlated materials have emerged which show physical properties anomalous in the context of the canonical fermi liquid theory .",
    "these include , in addition to the much studied high @xmath5 copper oxide superconductors@xcite , a class of novel heavy fermions@xcite , @xmath6 or @xmath7 electron based metals close to quantum criticality@xcite , quasi - one - dimensional materials@xcite , as well as certain artificially fabricated metallic point contacts@xcite .",
    "the theoretical question , then , is : under what conditions do electron correlations lead to a breakdown of fermi liquid theory ? in the past few years , several theoretical approaches have been taken to address this question .",
    "one approach builds on our understanding of the breakdown of fermi liquid theory in one dimension . for weakly interacting one dimensional fermion systems",
    ", the perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) leads to the g - ology classification of spatially homogeneous metallic states .",
    "the possible states are luttinger liquids or those with divergent cdw , sdw or superconducting correlation functions@xcite . in",
    "dimensions higher than one , perturbative rg analysis has shown that , the fermi liquid theory does describe weakly interacting fermion systems with a regular density of states@xcite .",
    "the mechanism for the breakdown of fermi liquid theory is necessarily non - perturbative in interaction strength@xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to non - fermi liquids uses local physics as a starting point .",
    "the motivations behind this approach are multi - fold .",
    "first of all , most of the correlated electron systems are transition - metal , rare earth or actinides based compounds .",
    "the dominant electron - electron interactions in these systems are local in space .",
    "this is the result of quantum chemistry : the partially - filled @xmath6 or @xmath7 orbitals are much more contracted than the @xmath8 and @xmath9orbitals of the simple metals and covalent semiconductors , making the intra - site coulomb interactions by far the largest interaction parameter .",
    "secondly , anderson- and kondo- like impurity models have been studied extensively for more than three decades@xcite . in particular , the multi - channel kondo problem has long been recognized to display rg fixed points of the non - fermi liquid variety@xcite .",
    "finally , the large @xmath0 dynamical mean field theory@xcite opens the door for systematic treatment of the competition between local dynamics and spatial fluctuations .",
    "the work summarized here covers a specific source of local physics towards non - fermi liquids , namely the competition between local charge ( valence ) fluctuations and spin fluctuations .",
    "this belongs to the domain of mixed valence physics , a classic problem in condensed matter theory .",
    "it is different from the multi - channel physics for non - fermi liquids@xcite . in the remainder of this section ,",
    "i introduce the problem , define the models , and summarize the essential new results .",
    "more detailed discussions of the underlying physics are given in the subsequent sections : sections ii and iii focus on the single impurity generalized anderson model , and sections iv and v discuss the two - band extended hubbard lattice model .",
    "extensive studies on the heavy fermion metals have led to a canonical picture for the formation of a fermi liquid in metals with strong local electron - electron interactions .",
    "1 illustrates the point .",
    "plotted here are the temperature dependence of the cu - site nmr relaxation rate@xcite ( @xmath10 ) and that of the electrical resistivity@xcite in @xmath3 , one of the so - called `` vegetable '' heavy fermions . at",
    "asymptotically low temperatures , the nmr relaxation rate@xcite is linear in temperature , while the electrical resistivity is quadratic in temperature . both are characteristic of quasiparticle contributions .",
    "simplistically speaking ,",
    "the number of thermally excited spin excitations is proportional to temperature as a result of the fermi - dirac distribution . and",
    "each spin excitation contributes a temperature - independent term to the flipping rate of nuclear spins , but a @xmath11linear term to the quasiparticle scattering rate .",
    "the latter is again due to the fermi statistics , which reduces the phase space for quasiparticle - quasiparticle scatterings .",
    "the experimental data behave very differently at temperatures above about @xmath12k . here , the nmr relaxation rate becomes essentially temperature - independent , while the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity is characteristic of kondo - scattering from local moments@xcite .",
    "a local moment picture serves as a better starting point to describe the @xmath7electron degrees of freedom in this temperature range .",
    "this crossover phenomenon provided the phenomenological basis for the canonical theoretical picture for heavy fermion metals . in this picture , the @xmath7electrons cross over from incoherent moments at high temperatures to being part of the renormalized quasiparticles in a coherent fermi liquid at the lowest temperatures .",
    "this is the lattice analog of the broad crossover that is known in the solution to the single impurity kondo problem@xcite . in the single impurity problem ,",
    "the characteristic crossover temperature is the kondo energy . in the lattice case",
    ", the crossover temperature relates to the coherence energy scale below which the elementary excitations are quasiparticles with heavy mass .",
    "the coherence energy acts as the renormalized fermi energy for the low energy quasiparticle excitations .",
    "this canonical picture appears to break down for a set of novel @xmath7electron materials@xcite . at low temperatures",
    ", these materials typically have an electrical resistivity linear in temperature , accompanied by anomalous features in a host of other physical properties .",
    "the precise mechanisms for these low temperature non - fermi liquid phenomenologies are at this stage unclear .",
    "we refer the readers to the contribution of miranda et al.@xcite in this volume for a survey of theoretical ideas .",
    "the crossover from high to low energies in these systems are only beginning to be addressed@xcite .    in the normal state of the high @xmath13 cuprates ,",
    "the spin dynamics appear to show a crossover qualitatively similar to that of the heavy fermions . shown in fig .",
    "2 are the temperature dependences of the nmr relaxation rate@xcite and electrical resistivity@xcite in the optimally doped @xmath14 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the nmr relaxation rate behaves in a way reminiscent of that of @xmath3 .",
    "it has the asymptotic low temperature @xmath11linear behavior , crossing over to an essentially temperature - independent behavior at high temperatures .",
    "the crossover temperature scale is about @xmath15 , much higher than that of the heavy fermions .",
    "the spin excitations can be thought of as the quasiparticle - quasihole continuum at low temperatures , but as excitations derived from local moments with short range antiferromagnetic coupling at high temperatures .",
    "this picture is corroborated by the neutron scattering results .",
    "the low energy incommensurate peaks are most naturally accounted for in terms of a quasiparticle contribution , while the high energy broad background is naturally interpreted in terms of short range local moment correlations@xcite .    however , when it comes to the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity , the analogy with the heavy fermions stops .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the electrical resistivity is linear in temperature over essentially the entire temperature range .    by now",
    ", there exist strong evidences that the dominant contribution to the electrical resistivity in the high @xmath16 cuprates comes from electron - electron scattering@xcite , as is the case for the heavy fermions .",
    "the nmr relaxation rate is of course dominated by the electronic contributions .",
    "it is therefore quite unusual that electrons in these systems yield very similar magnetic responses ( albeit with different energy scales ) , but entirely different charge transport properties . at the microscopic level",
    ", both the heavy fermions and copper oxides can be described by a model with a strongly correlated band and a weakly correlated one .",
    "the strongly correlated band is formed from the @xmath7 orbitals in the heavy fermions and from the @xmath17 orbitals in the cuprates .",
    "the weakly correlated band is from the non@xmath18 orbitals in the heavy fermions and from the oxygen @xmath19 orbitals in the cuprates . for heavy fermions ,",
    "the point of departure for most theoretical work is the anderson lattice model . for cuprates ,",
    "the model that serves as a sufficiently general microscopic starting point is the three band extended hubbard model@xcite .",
    "each ( planar ) unit cell contains one copper @xmath20 orbital and two oxygen @xmath19 orbitals .",
    "the non - bonding combination of the @xmath19 orbitals is not expected to play an important role .",
    "when this non - bonding combination is ignored , the three band extended hubbard model reduces to a two band anderson lattice like model . we will call this class of models as the two band extended hubbard model@xcite .    inspired by these considerations , the theoretical question we ask is : can metallic non - fermi liquids occur in the two band extended hubbard model ?",
    "we will address this question by incorporating general local interactions allowed by symmetry .",
    "our goal is to treat interactions in a non - perturbative fashion , and seek to classify all the possible universality classes of this model .",
    "recent work on this subject can be naturally separated into two categories .",
    "work in the first category concern exclusively the single impurity physics .",
    "we have generalized the standard anderson model by including all the on - site interactions allowed by symmetry@xcite .",
    "the authors of refs . @xcite have generalized the standard anderson model by introducing additional species of screening fermions .",
    "work in the second category deal with the large @xmath0 limit of the lattice extended hubbard model@xcite .",
    "here we address the physics of the lattice model based on our understandings of the corresponding impurity problem .",
    "connecting the local physics of an impurity model and a lattice model has a long tradition .",
    "for instance , the slave boson large-@xmath21 approach was first constructed to describe the fermi liquid state of the single impurity anderson model@xcite .",
    "the understanding of the impurity problem set the stage for the slave boson large-@xmath21 description of the coherent fermi liquid state of the anderson - lattice model@xcite .",
    "the generalized anderson model we introduced@xcite is    @xmath22    here , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 being the pauli matrices , and @xmath30 .",
    "the first four terms describe the standard anderson model . for the single impurity spin@xmath31 @xmath6orbital ,",
    "the energy level is @xmath32 , and the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath33 . for the most part",
    ", we will consider only the @xmath34 limit .",
    "for the spin@xmath31 conduction @xmath35electrons , the energy dispersion is @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 is the wannier orbital of the @xmath35electrons at the impurity site .",
    "it hybridizes with the @xmath6electron through the hybridization matrix @xmath38 .",
    "the last two terms are additional interaction terms allowed by symmetry .",
    "@xmath39 describes a local density - density interaction between the impurity @xmath6 and local @xmath35 electrons . in the heavy fermion literature , this term is called the falicov - kimball interaction@xcite .",
    "@xmath40 describes the spin exchange interaction between the @xmath6 and @xmath35 electrons .",
    "it describes the sum of the direct exchange interaction and the indirect exchange interactions mediated by those high energy configurations not included in the model hamiltonian .",
    "the standard anderson model with a featureless conduction electron density of states has already been solved . in the particle - hole ( p - h ) symmetric case , namely for @xmath41 , the impurity @xmath6levels are illustrated in fig .",
    "3(a ) . for sufficiently large u ,",
    "the empty impurity configuration ( @xmath42 ) and the doubly occupied impurity configuration ( @xmath43 ) can be eliminated through a schrieffer - wolff transformation@xcite .",
    "the result is the kondo problem with antiferromagnetic exchange interaction .",
    "the latter problem is solved by a variety of methods , including scaling@xcite , numerical renormalization group ( nrg)@xcite , bethe ansatz@xcite , slave boson large n method@xcite , and conformal field theory@xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that , the low lying excitations can be well described by the strong coupling fermi liquid fixed point .",
    "the local moment is quenched by the conduction electron spin polarization and hence disappears from the low lying excitation spectrum .    in the p - h asymmetric case , @xmath44",
    ", three impurity configurations have to be retained at low energies .",
    "this is the mixed valence problem .",
    "it differs from the kondo problem in that low lying local charge ( valence ) fluctuations coexist with spin fluctuations .",
    "historically , a variational study by varma and yafet@xcite , and rg studies of haldane@xcite and krishnamurthy _",
    "et al._@xcite , the bethe ansatz solution@xcite and the slave boson large",
    "- n results@xcite have all found that the low energy behavior of the mixed valence problem is described by a strong coupling , fermi liquid fixed point .",
    "this fixed point is qualitatively similar to that of the kondo problem , though quantities such as the wilson ratio are modified .    in refs .",
    ", we studied the generalized anderson impurity model by extending haldane s rg scheme such that the local charge fluctuations and local spin fluctuations are treated on an equal footing . in the mixed valence regime , there exist three , and only three , kinds of fixed points .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned strong coupling fermi liquid phase , there are two non - fermi liquid phases which we termed the weak coupling phase and the intermediate phase . the strong coupling and weak coupling phases are the direct analog of the strong coupling phase of the antiferromagnetic kondo problem and the weak coupling phase of the ferromagnetic kondo problem , respectively . as for the local moment case",
    ", the weak coupling phase of the mixed valence problem requires that the exchange coupling be ferromagnetic .",
    "therefore , this state is likely be of only academic value for the most part .",
    "the possible exception is the double - exchange model for the perovskite manganese oxides@xcite .",
    "the intermediate phase is unique to the mixed valence regime .",
    "its existence came as a surprise . in this new phase , spin and charge excitations",
    "are separated ; the spin susceptibility remains to have the fermi liquid form as in the strong coupling phase , while the charge susceptibility and the single particle green s function have an algebraic behavior with interaction - dependent exponents .",
    "our rg results are substantiated by the strong coupling atomic analysis@xcite and by the exact solutions at certain exactly soluble points ( toulouse points)@xcite .",
    "the single impurity model that perakis et al.@xcite studied using nrg is defined as follows ,    @xmath45    where @xmath46 , for @xmath47 , describe fermionic bands that interact , but do not hybridize , with the impurity @xmath6electron .",
    "the screening interactions @xmath48 are introduced so that the friedel sum rule is satisfied@xcite . ref . reported nrg results in the mixed valence regime ( with @xmath34 ) .",
    "the numerical results for the case of sufficiently large values of the screening interactions were interpreted as displaying divergent charge and spin susceptibilities near the mixed valence point .",
    "such a phase is not expected from the coulomb gas rg analysis . within the coulomb gas rg picture ,",
    "the effect of screening fermions is to modify the initial conditions of the rg flow@xcite .",
    "the additional screening channels , while increasing the orthogonality effects , do not participate in the formation of fixed points other than those within our rg classification . for sufficiently strong @xmath48",
    ", the coulomb gas analysis predicts that the mixed valence state is the intermediate phase , with divergent charge susceptibility but _ regular _ spin susceptibility .",
    "while further nrg studies are clearly called for , here we note that the existing numerical data of ref .",
    "might actually not be inconsistent with our coulomb gas rg prediction .",
    "the reason is simple . unlike for the charge susceptibility , the spin susceptibility continues to increase when @xmath32 is decreased through the transition regime .",
    "a true divergence is therefore hard to detect numerically .",
    "the two - band extended hubbard model is the lattice analog of the generalized anderson model eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian.gam ] ) , and is defined by the following hamiltonian ,    @xmath49    the notations are essentially the same as in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian.gam ] ) .",
    "the only difference is that we have used @xmath50 to label the @xmath6electron level to emphasize the difference of this quantity in the lattice model with that of the impurity model @xmath32 ( see the discussions around eq .",
    "( [ eff.dlevel ] ) below ) .",
    "the first four terms describe the standard anderson lattice model .",
    "the spin-@xmath51 @xmath6 electrons have an infinite on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath33 , and an energy level @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 describes the kinetic energy term of the @xmath35electrons . at every site ,",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath35 electrons hybridize with each other through the hybridization matrix @xmath38 .",
    "the last two terms represent the on - site density - density and exchange interactions between the two bands at every site .    unlike for the single impurity problem ,",
    "most of the studies on the anderson lattice model in literature focus on the p - h asymmetric case .",
    "this is because the conventional heavy fermion metallic states are formed only in the p - h asymmetric case ( the p - h symmetric case has received renewed interests due to the new developments on the so - called kondo insulators@xcite ) .",
    "we do not know as much about the standard anderson lattice model as about the standard single impurity anderson model .",
    "only few of the theoretical methods that have been used in the single impurity problem are generalizable to the lattice case .",
    "this includes the gutzwiller - like variational wavefunctions@xcite and the slave boson large - n method@xcite .",
    "all these approaches have lead to the conclusion that the low energy regime is described by a fermi liquid with heavy mass quasiparticles .",
    "the slave boson large n method has also been applied to the copper oxide model@xcite . in the metallic states without long range order ,",
    "the solution is again a fermi liquid .",
    "our new understandings of the impurity physics , combined with the large @xmath0 approach , have led to the conclusions that metallic non - fermi liquid solutions are possible in the extended hubbard model .",
    "this conclusion is firmly established in the large @xmath0 limit@xcite .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the mixed valence condition is much easier to realize in the lattice models than in the single impurity model .",
    "we focus first on the single impurity problem . given that the on - site repulsion is taken to be infinity",
    ", the generalized anderson model can be thought of as a three level system with a particular form of symmetry breaking .",
    "the schematic picture is given in fig .",
    "the three levels correspond to the three impurity configurations : @xmath54 . the hybridization @xmath38 , density - density interaction @xmath39 , and spin - exchange @xmath40 couple these three levels to the free conduction electron bath . among the three levels ,",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 are degenerate in the absence of external magnetic field .",
    "no symmetry , however , dictates the degeneracy of @xmath42 with @xmath57 .",
    "it is therefore necessary to keep track of the energy level difference , @xmath32 , between @xmath57 and @xmath42 .",
    "this section summarizes the rg analysis on the three - level system near its criticality .",
    "analysis of certain exactly - soluble points  the toulouse points  is the topic of the next section .",
    "the rg analysis is based on a coulomb gas representation@xcite of the three - level system .",
    "this is carried out through an expansion in terms of the hopping amplitudes between the three configurations of the impurity problem .",
    "this is an extension of the classic work of haldane@xcite such that the local charge fluctuations and spin fluctuations are treated on an equal footing .    in practice",
    ", it is convenient to break the exchange coupling @xmath58 into @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 represent the longitudinal and spin - flip components , respectively . @xmath39 and @xmath62 are diagonal in the impurity configuration basis .",
    "their effects are to cause different scattering potentials for the conduction electrons when they see different impurity configurations .",
    "when the impurity configuration is frozen in @xmath63 , the scattering potential that the conduction electron of spin @xmath64 experiences is @xmath65 :    @xmath66    quite differently , the effects of @xmath38 and @xmath61 terms are to cause quantum transitions between different impurity configurations",
    ". specifically , the hybridization @xmath38 term causes transitions between the empty and singly occupied impurity configurations , and the spin - flip @xmath61 term the spin up and spin down impurity configurations .    to construct the coulomb gas representation ,",
    "we expand the partition function in terms of @xmath38 and @xmath61 , and integrate out the conduction electron degrees of freedom .",

    "a history corresponds to a sequence of quantum mechanical hopping from one impurity state to another along the imaginary time axis . a transition from impurity state @xmath63 to @xmath69",

    "here we quote the results ,    @xmath88    the rg flow of the fugacities determine how the amplitude for making transitions between different impurity configurations are modified as we go towards longer time scales .",
    "when the amplitude grows the system is a fermi liquid in analogy to the formation of fermi liquid in the usual kondo problem .",
    "when this amplitude renormalizes to zero , quantum coherence is destroyed and fermi liquid theory breaks down .",
    "this way , we cast the breakdown of fermi liquid theory in the framework of the macroscopic quantum coherence ( mqc ) problem@xcite .",

    "we deal with a special _ three - level _ system instead of the canonical _ two - level _ system studied in the mqc literature .",

    "there is one important difference in symmetry between the asymmetric anderson model and the p - h symmetric resonant level model .",

    "in particular , the occupation numbers of the lattice , for a given chemical potential , can be obtained from the local green s functions of the corresponding impurity model .",
    "it follows from our analysis of the impurity model that , at zero temperature , @xmath246 ( and also @xmath247 ) are discontinuous functions of the chemical potential : @xmath248 for @xmath249 , while @xmath250 for @xmath251 . at finite temperatures",
    ", @xmath246 is increased from @xmath252 to @xmath253 as @xmath254 is increased from @xmath255 to @xmath256 where    @xmath257    as long as @xmath246 is over the range @xmath258 , the condition eq .",
    "( [ critical.ed0 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the correlation functions will be controlled by the intermediate phase at criticality .",
    "it is remarkable that the fact that our impurity model is associated to a lattice problem forces the effective impurity model to be at criticality , with a larger symmetry than we would have naively expected .",
    "physically , for an incoherent state to be metallic , it is necessary to allow charge transfer between the local degrees of freedom and the bath .",
    "this can only happen if the local charge degrees of freedom is in equilibrium with the conduction electron bath .",
    "this requires the heavy level to be at the chemical potential .",
    "the rg analysis that leads to the classification of the possible phases of the effective impurity problem discussed in section ii is based on a small hybridization expansion . in the context of the low energy",
    "effective hamiltonians for the high @xmath16 system , one of the important questions is whether the extended hubbard model can be further reduced to an effective one band hubbard model@xcite .",
    "one argument used in this context is that , when the hybridization is sufficiently large , it is more appropriate to first diagonalize the problem within a unit cell , leading to the zhang - rice singlet@xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the low energy local orbitals is the so called @xmath259 hamiltonian . in light of this construction ,",
    "a natural question to ask is whether the physics of the extended hubbard model at large hybridization is different from that at small hybridization .",
    "the large @xmath0 limit provides a unique opportunity to address this question .",
    "this problem has only been numerically studied in the spinless version of the extended hubbard model@xcite .",
    "the numerical solution indicates that the qualitative phase diagram is similar for the large and small hybridization limits .",
    "however , the precise values of the exponents of the correlation functions could be modified as the hybridization is increased",
    ". further work along this direction needs to be carried out .",
    "we have established the existence of metallic non - fermi liquid states in the extended hubbard model eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian.ehm ] ) in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "what happens in finite dimensions ?",
    "this is a question which is only beginning to be addressed .",
    "some progresses are reported in the next section .",
    "we close this section on a methodological note .",
    "various numerical methods , such as quantum monte carlo@xcite and exact diagonalization@xcite , can be used to solve the self - consistent dynamical mean field equations associated with the @xmath260 limit .",
    "whatever the means , the solution to these equations should always describe the solution to an impurity coupled to a self - consistent fermionic bath . and",
    "it is always instructive to ask a ) what is the nature of the density of states of the self - consistent fermionic bath near its fermi energy ( is it regular , gapped , vanishing with a power law , or singular with a power law , to name a few ) ; and b ) what are the low lying levels associated with the impurity .",
    "armed with these information , it is usually possible to use rg or other analytical means to determine the qualitative behavior of the solution .",
    "one major advantage of the large @xmath0 approach is being able to treat local correlations in a fully dynamical fashion .",
    "this feature is responsible for our uncovering the metallic non - fermi liquids in the extended hubbard model that other methods have failed .",
    "one major disadvantage of the large@xmath261 approach is that , spatial fluctuations beyond one particle level are all frozen : intersite interactions reduce to hartree contributions only . for physical systems in finite dimensions ,",
    "intersite rkky or superexchange type interactions are expected to compete with local correlations .",
    "for instance , an unstable non - fermi liquid fixed point arises due to the competition between the inter - impurity rkky interaction and the local kondo couplings in the two - impurity kondo problem@xcite . in the kondo lattice models ,",
    "such a competition led to the competition between long range magnetic ordering and kondo singlet formation . in the absence of long range ordering ,",
    "the dynamical role of the intersite interactions on the local kondo - like physics has largely been left unexplored . from the large@xmath261 point of view , one way to recover the spatial fluctuations is the perturbative @xmath225 expansion . truncating the perturbation series to order @xmath262 requires solving at once clusters containing one , two , ... , @xmath263 sites embedded in their respective self - consistent media@xcite .",
    "the practicality of this procedure is unclear at this stage .",
    "an alternative route is a loop expansion with the requirement that the @xmath260 results be recovered at the saddle - point level , as has been constructed in models with certains forms of quenched disorder@xcite . for clean systems",
    ", it turns out to be difficult to formulate such a loop expansion .",
    "we have recently introduced an alternative large @xmath0 limit to study the interplay between local correlations and short range spatial fluctuations in the two band extended hubbard model@xcite . in this procedure ,",
    "an explicit intersite density - density interaction term is introduced , and is scaled in terms of the dimensionality such that its _ fluctuation part _ survives the large d limit .",
    "this procedure leads to an impurity embedded in a self - consistent fermionic bath _ and a self - consistent bosonic bath_. detailed analysis@xcite has so far been carried out only for the spinless version of the extended hubbard model , given by the following hamiltonian ,    @xmath264\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\sum_{<ij>}[t_{ij } c_{i}^{\\dagger}c_j + v_{ij } : n_{di } : : n_{dj } : ] \\label{hamiltonian.tv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the standard large @xmath0 limit is taken with @xmath53 of the form eq .",
    "( [ hopping.scaling ] ) and @xmath265 of order @xmath225 . with that scaling",
    ", only the static component of @xmath265 gives a non - vanishing contribution in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "hence , intersite interactions give only a hartree contribution .",
    "the alternative large @xmath0 limit is taken with eq .",
    "( [ hopping.scaling ] ) and    @xmath266    in order to have a well - defined large @xmath0 limit , it is necessary that the zero frequency mode , i.e. the hartree term , be treated separately . in the absence of symmetry breaking , the effect of the hartree term is a change to the chemical potential .",
    "this is handled through normal ordering , @xmath267 .",
    "the procedure outlined in the previous section leads to the following effective impurity action ,    @xmath268    in addition to the self - consistency equation ( [ self-consist.sp ] ) , an additional self - consistency equation is required , this one for the density propagator ,    @xmath269 \\label{self - consist.new}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath270 is the fourier transform of the lattice density - density correlation function , @xmath271 .",
    "@xmath272 is the bosonic matsubara frequency .",

    "the dispersion , @xmath274 , and the hybridization coupling parameter , @xmath275 , are to be determined self - consistently .",

    "the corresponding self - consistent dispersion and coupling parameters are @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "detailed analysis shows that , in this case , the fermionic bath density of states remains regular .",
    "the spectral function of the bosonic bath , however , can be highly non - ohmic .",
    "this is fortunate , for an impurity model with a fermionic bath having an arbitrary form of density of states near the fermi energy is quite difficult to handle@xcite . on the other hand , an impurity model coupled to a bosonic bath with non - ohmic spectral function",

    "the problem reduces to the usual large @xmath0 case discussed in the previous section@xcite . for our spinless problem",

    ", we are able to establish the existence of a phase transition as @xmath290 is increased . for sufficiently strong @xmath290 ,",
    "the solution must be a non - fermi liquid .",
    "physically , the intersite density - density interactions provide charge - screening , which contribute to the orthogonality effect . in the mixed valence regime",
    ", this orthogonality helps realize the weak coupling fixed point with incoherent charge excitations .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath290 , on the other hand , the fermi liquid solution is stable .    as a result ,",
    "non - fermi liquids with self - similar correlation functions occur even for repulsive values of the on - site density - density interaction .",
    "it is therefore not necessary to require attractive on - site interactions to realize the incoherent charge state .",
    "a finite intersite interaction @xmath290 also changes the nature of the phase transition .",
    "we have shown that@xcite the phase transition is not of the kosterlitz - thouless type .",
    "we have been unable to establish the precise nature of the phase transition .    the self - consistent equations and the kink gas analysis can also be carried out in the spinful hubbard model .",
    "the form of scaling equations implies that the results derived here for the spinless model carries over to the charge sector of the spin - charge separated intermediate phase@xcite .",
    "the formalism outlined in this section can be generalized to various different contexts .",
    "the effects of intersite spin exchange interactions are the obvious next problem to study .",
    "three or more particle intersite interactions can also be treated along this line .",
    "the focus of this review article has been on the competition between local charge and local spin fluctuations , both in the single impurity anderson model and in the lattice extended hubbard model .",
    "we have found that such a competition leads to metallic non - fermi liquids in certain interaction parameter range . in particular , we have identified a novel non - fermi liquid mixed valence state , called intermediate phase .",
    "this phase displays the phenomenon of spin - charge separation .",
    "the low energy spin excitations are much like that of the strong coupling fermi liquid phase as one would derive from , for instance , the slave boson condensed phase within the slave boson large - n approach .",
    "the charge excitations are distinctively of a non - fermi liquid form .",
    "are these non - fermi liquid states relevant to real materials ? for single impurity problems , these non - fermi liquid phases can be realized only when the impurity level is tuned to be close to the fermi energy of the conduction electrons .",
    "we can envisage two contexts in which this kind of fine tuning of the impurity level is physically feasible .",
    "the first is in the context of dilute impurities in metals .",
    "the fermi level of the conduction electron sea can be varied by substituting some of the elements in the compound with ones of different valency . called fermi level tuning , this mechanism has already been invoked to explain the trend of the kondo energy in certain uranium based heavy fermions@xcite .",
    "valence fluctuations in uranium based compounds are in general much stronger than in cerium based compounds .",
    "it is conceivable that some of them have interaction parameters that fall in the domain of the intermediate phase .",
    "systematic studies of the fermi level tuning phenomenon , therefore , can play a significant role in the current search and study of non - fermi liquids in @xmath7electron based materials .",
    "the second context where impurity level can be tuned is in mesoscopic systems .",
    "this time , the tuning is achieved through biasing the confined area with respect to the leads@xcite .    for lattice problems ,",
    "the level tuning requirement is much less stringent .",
    "this is the result of the phenomenon of the pinning of chemical potential , discussed extensively in sec .",
    "iv . there is a range of electron density over which the _ effective _ impurity level lies close to the fermi level of the self - consistent fermion bath .",
    "our findings of the existence of both the strong coupling and intermediate phases in the mixed valence regime provide new insights into the similarities and differences between the heavy fermions and high @xmath16 cuprates , mentioned at the beginning of this manuscript .",
    "the spin dynamics of the intermediate phase and the strong coupling phase are similar , both displaying a crossover from the high temperature local moment regime into the low temperature coherent regime .",
    "the charge dynamics , on the other hand , are qualitatively different in these two phases . in the strong coupling fermi liquid phase ,",
    "the charge dynamics track with the spin dynamics . in the intermediate phase ,",
    "the charge dynamics have non - fermi liquid behavior characterized by the correlation functions discussed in sections ii and iii .",
    "the phenomenology of the conventional heavy fermions , such as @xmath293 and @xmath294 , are well described by the strong coupling fermi liquid phase .",
    "can the normal state of the high @xmath16 cuprates be described by the intermediate phase ?",
    "the contrasting behaviors seen in the temperature dependences of the nmr relaxation rate and the electrical resistivity in the cuprates ( fig .",
    "2 ) , when viewed in the context of those of the heavy fermions ( fig .",
    "1 ) , are consistent with the qualitative differences between the spin and charge dynamics expected in the intermediate phase . however , these two quantities measure very different correlation functions .",
    "the nmr relaxation rate measures mainly the momentum ( @xmath295 ) averaged electron - spin response , while the electrical resistivity the @xmath296 electrical current - current correlation function .",
    "therefore , the precise implications of the contrasting temperature dependences of these two quantities in the cuprates are hard to specify .",
    "one clear - cut probe of the relationship between the spin and charge excitations would be to compare the temperature dependences of the electron - spin resistivity and the electrical resistivity@xcite .",
    "this requires an experimental measurement of the electron - spin diffusion constant .",
    "our results also raise a number of theoretical questions .",
    "unlike for the multi - channel kondo problem , the lattice model we have studied , eq . ( [ hamiltonian.ehm ] ) , has a well defined limit of vanishing interactions , @xmath297 , @xmath298 and @xmath299 . in this limit of vanishing interactions , and for dimensions higher than one , the perturbative rg analysis@xcite would identify no instability towards a metallic non - fermi liquid state . by focusing on the strong coupling limit , @xmath34 , and taking the limit of infinite dimensions , @xmath300 , we have identified non - fermi liquid solutions .",
    "obvious questions arise : a ) what happens as the on - site hubbard interaction @xmath33 gradually decreases from infinity , all the way to @xmath301 ?",
    "if a phase transition takes place , is it also of the kosterlitz - thouless form ?",
    "b ) what happens when the dimensionality decreases from infinity to physical dimensions ? the approach outlined in section v provides a starting point to address one aspect of the finite dimensionality effects , namely the competition between the on - site and inter - site correlations .",
    "the results summarized there imply that the non - fermi liquid phases survive the short range spatial fluctuations .",
    "the critical behavior of the quantum phase transition from the fermi liquid to non - fermi liquid states , on the other hand , are strongly modified by the spatial correlations . as for a )",
