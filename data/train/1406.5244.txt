    "solar twins are stars nearly indistinguishable from the sun @xcite .",
    "the star 18 sco was first identified as a solar twin by @xcite .",

    "18 sco has a declination of @xmath78 @xmath8 , hence being observable from both the northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "besides the many recent high resolution chemical abundance studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , granulation @xcite , seismology @xcite and interferometry @xcite .",
    "in addition , different techniques can be combined to obtain further insights on the fundamental properties of this solar twin @xcite .",
    "most previous abundance studies on 18 sco report a somewhat enhanced ( about 10 - 15% ) iron abundance and a li content about 3 - 4 times higher than solar , but otherwise about solar abundance ratios for other elements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , except for some recent high precision studies on 18 sco ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which show a clear trend with condensation temperature .",
    "the situation regarding the heavy elements is less clear , with @xcite reporting a slight excess in the elements heavier than sr , but the recent study by @xcite finding about solar ratios for the neutron - capture elements in 18 sco .",
    "instead , @xcite found a clear enhancement in sr , ba , nd and sm , but solar ratios for y and ce . to further complicate the situation , @xcite found a solar ratio for nd ( an element that was found enhanced by da silva et al .",
    "2012 ) , but eu and zr showed the largest enrichment .",
    "the worst cases are zr and nd , with a spread of 0.15 dex and 0.14 dex , respectively , and individual values of [ zr / fe ] = -0.05 , + 0.06 , + 0.10 , and [ nd / fe ] = -0.01 , 0.13 , 0.00 , according to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    in order to better understand the likely chemical differences between 18 sco and the sun , and to clarify the situation regarding the heavy elements ( z @xmath9 30 ) ,",
    "we perform a highly precise abundance analysis of 18 sco for 38 chemical elements , thus being the most complete and precise abundance study to date on the chemical composition of 18 sco .",
    "additionally , our precise stellar parameters will be used in a forthcoming paper to better constrain the fundamental properties of 18 sco in synergy with other techniques such as asteroseismology ( bazot et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "our work is also relevant regarding `` chemical tagging '' @xcite , that aims to reconstruct the build up of our galaxy by identifying stars with a common origin .",
    "although the dynamical information about their origin could have been lost , the chemical information should be preserved . in this context , the disentangling of the complex abundance pattern of 18 sco can help us to assess which elements should be targeted for chemical tagging .    the analysis is mainly based on uv - optical spectra acquired with the uves spectrograph at the vlt and complemented with optical spectra taken with hires at keck .",
    "in order to cover a wide spectral range , we observed 18 sco and the sun ( using solar reflected light from asteroids ) in different spectrograph configurations . both 18 sco and the reference solar spectrum",
    "were acquired in the same observing runs and using identical setups .",
    "we obtained visitor mode observations with the uves spectrograph at the vlt ( august 30 , 2009 ) and with the hires spectrograph at keck ( june 16 , 2005 ) , covering with both datasets the uv / optical / near - ir spectrum from 306 to 1020 nm .",
    "the uves observations were taken in dichroic mode , obtaining thus simultaneous uv ( blue arm ) + optical ( red arm ) coverage with the standard settings 346 nm + 580 nm , and another set of observations with the standard 346-nm setting plus a non - standard setting centered at 830 nm . with this configuration",
    "we achieved a high s / n in the uv , as the 346 nm setting ( 306 - 387 nm ) was covered in both setups . the 580-nm standard setting covered the optical ( 480 - 682 nm ) region and our 830-nm setting included the red region ( 642 - 1020 nm ) . notice that our non - standard setting at 830 nm was chosen to overlap the 580 nm setting in the 642 - 682 nm interval , so that a higher s / n was achieved around 670 nm in order to measure lithium with extremely high precision ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the bulk of the analysis is based on the uves optical spectra obtained in the red arm covering the 480 - 1020 nm region .",
    "the observations with the red arm were obtained using the 0.3 arcsec slit , achieving a high resolving power ( r = 110 000 ) and a very high s / n ( typical s / n @xmath0 800 pixel@xmath4 , and around the li feature s / n @xmath0 1000 ) . some elements showing lines in the uv were studied with the uves blue arm using the 346 nm setup ( 306 - 387 nm ) with a slit of 0.6 arcsec , resulting in high resolution ( r = 65 000 ) high s / n ( @xmath0 600 at 350 nm ) spectra .",
    "the asteroid juno was employed to obtain our reference solar spectrum for the uves observations , and similar s / n were achieved both for 18 sco and juno .",
    "the spectral regions 387 - 480 nm and 577 - 585 nm are missing in our uves data , thus , for them we employed high resolution ( r = 100 000 ) high s / n ( @xmath0 400 ) spectra obtained with the hires spectrograph at keck , that covers the optical spectra ( 388 - 800 nm ) using a mosaic of 3 ccds .",
    "the asteroid ceres was used to obtain a solar spectrum for our hires observations . in @xcite",
    "we made a detailed comparison of both uves and hires observations of 18 sco relative to the sun , and concluded that there is an excellent agreement between both datasets , resulting in negligible abundances differences ( mean difference of 0.002@xmath20.001 dex and element - to - element scatter @xmath10 = 0.005 dex ) , thus we complement our uves equivalent width measurements with hires data when needed .    data reductions of the uves and hires spectra are described in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . a comparison of the reduced uves spectra of 18 sco and the sun is shown around 6085   ( fig .",
    "[ compara ] ) and 5320   ( fig .",
    "[ comparand ] ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ compara ] , overall the spectrum of 18 sco is very similar to the sun s , as expected for a solar twin , yet , when a closer look is taken for the lines of neutron - capture elements , a clear enhancement is seen in 18 sco , as shown for example in fig .",
    "[ comparand ] for the 5319.8    line .",
    "the abundance analysis closely follows our recent high precision studies on the solar twins hip 56948 @xcite and hip 102152 @xcite .",
    "we measured the equivalent widths ( ew ) automatically with ares @xcite for lines with ew larger than 10 m .",
    "weaker lines , as well as species with less than 5 lines available , were measured by hand using iraf . in further iterations",
    "the outliers resulting from the automatic ew measurements are carefully measured by hand , making sure that exactly the same criteria are used in the measurements of 18 sco and the sun , i.e. , for each line we choose the same continuum definition and the same interval was selected to fit a gaussian profile . the main difference in relation to @xcite and @xcite , is that we have significantly expanded our line list to obtain more precise results and also to include many heavy elements .",
    "for example , in @xcite only 54 iron ( 42 , 12 ) and 12 chromium ( 7 , 5 ) lines were included , while in the present work 98 iron ( 86 , 12 ) and 21 chromium ( 14 , 7 ) lines are used . in comparison to @xcite , we have 87 additional lines , many of which were included to study the neutron - capture elements .    since our abundances were estimated from ew , we selected mostly clean lines .",
    "for example , the oxygen abundance was estimated using the clean triplet at 777 nm rather than the blended forbidden [ ] line at 630 nm .",
    "when necessary we used lines somewhat affected by blending , measuring them by using multiple gaussians with the deblend option of the task splot in iraf .",
    "the list of lines with the differential equivalent width measurements is presented in table [ ew ] , except for nitrogen and lithium , that were analysed by spectral synthesis of a nh feature at 340 nm and the feature at 670.7 nm , respectively .",

    "* ) , using kurucz odfnew model atmospheres @xcite and the 2002 version of moog @xcite . for the sun we fixed @xmath1 = 5777 k and log @xmath3 = 4.44 @xcite and as initial",
    "guess we used a microturbulence velocity of v@xmath11 = 0.86 km s@xmath4 @xcite .",

    "we found v@xmath14 = 0.88 km s@xmath4 and used this value and the above @xmath1 and log @xmath3 to compute the reference solar abundances ( @xmath15 ) .",

    "the above errors include both the measurement uncertainties ( from the errors in the slopes and the errors in the iron abundances ) , and the degeneracies in the stellar parameters , by estimating how the error in a given stellar parameter affects the uncertainty in the others .",

    "then , we can estimate the @xmath6-process contribution [ x / h]@xmath47 from    @xmath48_r^{ss}/\\delta_t}/10^{[x / h]_t/\\delta_t},\\ ] ]    where we define @xmath49 as the average of the three most enhanced @xmath44-process and @xmath6-process elements , corresponding to @xmath49 = 0.093 dex for the observed [ x / h]@xmath41 enrichment in 18 sco ( table [ ncapture ] ) .",
    "therefore , the predicted @xmath6-process contribution based on the solar system @xmath6-fractions , [ x / h]@xmath47 , is :    @xmath40_r^{ss } = \\delta_t \\times \\log_{10 } ( 1 - s_{ss } ) + [ x / h]_t.\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ 18sco3r ] , we compare the `` observed '' @xmath6-process enhancement [ x / h]@xmath12 ( eq .",
    "7 ) with the predicted one based on the solar system @xmath6-process fractions , [ x / h]@xmath47 ( eq . 9 ) .",
    "there is an astonishing agreement , strongly suggesting that the remaining enhancement is indeed due to the @xmath6-process .",
    "the impressive agreement , even at the scale of the small fluctuations ( @xmath00.02 dex ) among nearby n - capture elements ( fig [ 18sco3r ] ) , also suggests that even for heavy elements we suceeded in achieving abundances with errors of about 0.01 dex .    another way to show that the residual enhancement ( after subtracting the agb contribution ) is due to the @xmath6-process , is by comparing the @xmath6-fractions of the [ x / h]@xmath41 ratios with the @xmath6-fractions in the solar system . since the @xcite @xmath46-fractions fit somewhat better our [ x / h]@xmath12 ratios ( fig .",
    "[ 18sco3r ] ) , we will use their values in the comparison .",
    "the `` observed '' @xmath6-fractions in the [ x / h]@xmath41 ratios in 18 sco , are estimated by    @xmath50_r/\\delta_t}/10^{[x / h]_t/\\delta_t}.\\ ] ]    the `` observed '' @xmath6-fractions and the solar system @xmath51-fractions @xcite , are compared in fig .",
    "[ 18sco3rf ] .",
    "again , the agreement is remarkable ( slope of 0.90 and element - to - element scattter of only 0.04 ) , showing that after both the t@xmath52 trend and agb contribution are subtracted , the remaining material can be explained by the @xmath6-process .",
    "our high precision abundances provide independent evidence of the universality of the @xmath6-process , i.e. , to the remarkable similarity of the relative abundance pattern among different @xmath6-process elements .",
    "our finding is similar to what is found in metal - poor stars , where the scaled solar @xmath6-process pattern match the abundances of most neutron - capture elements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the complex abundance pattern of 18 sco can be thus explained by the condensation temperature trend , the @xmath44-process and the @xmath6-process",
    ". the excess of refractory elements relative to the sun seems to be typical of solar like stars @xcite , so 18 sco looks normal in this regard . as we will see below , the additional enhancement in the n - capture elements may be explained by the younger age of 18 sco ( section 4 ) .    a deficiency in the abundances of the @xmath44-process elements",
    "have been reported in our analysis of the pair of almost solar twins 16 cyg @xcite and the solar twin hip 102152 @xcite , which are both older than the sun by 2.5 and 3.7 gyr , respectively . on the contrary ,",
    "the s - process elements seem enhanced in the young solar twin 18 sco .",
    "thus , the increasing enhancement of the @xmath44-process elements with decreasing age is probably due to the pollution of successive generations of agb stars , that can be tracked using solar twins spanning ages from 2.9 gyr ( 18 sco ) up to 8.2 gyr ( hip 102152 ) .",
    "similar enhancements of the s - process elements have been found in open clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with ba showing the clearest trend of increasing abundance for younger ages .",
    "a similar trend was observed in field stars @xcite , but @xcite found no dependence of [ ba / fe ] and [ la / fe ] with age . albeit there is no consensus",
    "yet , most evidences point out for enhanced @xmath44-process abundances for decreasing ages .    regarding the r - process elements , @xcite found a decrease of [ sm / fe ] for decreasing ages in stars younger than the sun . using both eu abundances ( 4129   line ) and stellar ages determined by @xcite in thin disk stars",
    ", we found that for ages lower than 9 gyr there is a flat [ eu / fe ] ratio , i.e. , no dependence with stellar age .",
    "unfortunately , neither @xcite nor @xcite studied the dependence of their [ eu / fe ] ratios with age in thin disk stars .",
    "our analysis of two old solar twins @xcite , found normal @xmath6-process abundances for 16 cyg b and hip 102152 .",
    "based on the limited evidence , @xmath6-process elements seem to have a flat behavior with age .",
    "since 18 sco is considerably younger than the sun , the enhancement in the @xmath44-process elements could be due just to normal galactic chemical evolution .",
    "however , the enhancement of the @xmath6-process elements in 18 sco is more difficult to understand , as , based on our discussion above , those elements are not expected to be enriched .",
    "the unexpected enhancement of the @xmath6-process elements in 18 sco could be attributed to a somewhat higher contribution of @xmath6-process ejecta to the natal cloud of 18 sco than around other solar - like stars .",
    "our precise abundances show that whatever sources that produced the enrichment in the n - capture elements , did not produce substantial quantities of elements lighter than z = 30 .",
    "the amount of mass with z @xmath9 30 that would be needed to produced the observed enhancements is very small , only 2.7 @xmath53 m@xmath5 and 2.4 @xmath54 m@xmath5 for the @xmath44- and @xmath6-process , respectively .",
    "studying the detailed abundance pattern of solar type stars we may be able to reconstruct the build up of the galaxy using chemical tagging @xcite .",
    "one of the main problems when tagging individual stars to a given natal cloud may be radial migration @xcite , yet the chemical abundances may be preserved , hence using chemical tagging stellar groups or clusters could be reconstructed .    based on our precise abundances in 18 sco ,",
    "it is clear that different elements should be targeted for chemical tagging .",
    "first , as many of the highly volatile ( c , n , o ) and highly refractory elements ( al , ti , sc , ca , v , fe ) should be analyzed to determine if there is any trend with condensation temperature .",
    "if possible it would be important to cover also some semi - volatiles ( e.g. , s , zn , na , cu , k , mn , p ) and some medium refractories ( e.g. , si , mg , cr , ni , co , v ) , to verify if there is a break in the trend with condensation temperature @xcite .",
    "also , it should be important not to discard stars from a given group due to small discrepant abundances , as those anomalies could be due to either the formation of terrestrial @xcite or giant @xcite planets .",
    "some of the above elements are of course relevant to different nucleosynthetic processes such as production of @xmath55 elements ( o , s , ca , si , ti ) by sne ii or signatures of proton - burning ( na , mg , al , o ) . li is important as a potential chronometer @xcite and to study the transport mechanisms inside stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the study of 18 sco also shows the importance of including the heavy elements for chemical tagging .",
    "ideally , at least some elements between sr , zr , y or ba should be included to verify the @xmath44-process and some elements among ru , pd , ag , sm , gd , eu or dy could be explored for the @xmath6-process .",
    "we have performed the most precise and complete abundance analysis of 18 sco .",
    "being the brightest of the solar twins , very high s / n , high resolution spectra were gathered for 18 sco and the sun and a strictly differential line - by - line analysis was performed allowing us to achieve a precision of about 0.005 dex in differential abundances .",
    "additionally , highly precise stellar parameters were obtained , which would be important for further modeling of this solar twin using different techniques .",
    "precise radial velocities were gathered with harps , but no planet has been detected yet .    the complex abundance pattern of 18 sco shows enhancements ( relative to the sun ) in the refractory , @xmath44-process and @xmath6-process elements .",
    "after subtracting the trend with condensation temperature and the contribution from agb stars , the remaining enhancement shows the same pattern as the @xmath6-process in the solar system .",
    "this shows the universality of the @xmath6-process .",
    "the different contributions to the abundance enrichment in 18 sco could be disentangled thanks to the exquisite precision achieved in our work .
