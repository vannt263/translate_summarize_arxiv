    "however , the number of black hole detections to date is less than fifty ; this small number prevents a direct estimate of the black hole mass function . on the other hand",
    ", correlations between @xmath7 and other observables can be measured quite reliably , if one assumes that the @xmath8observable relation is a single power - law .",
    "@xmath7 is observed to correlate strongly and tightly with the velocity dispersion of the surrounding bulge ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) , as well as with bulge luminosity ( mclure & dunlop 2002 ) and bulge stellar mass ( marconi & hunt 2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ) : in all cases , a single power law appears to be an adequate description .",
    "since it is considerably easier to measure bulge properties than @xmath7 , black hole abundances are currently estimated by transforming the observed abundances of such secondary indicators using the observed correlations with @xmath7 ( yu & tremaine 2002 ; aller & richstone 2002 ; marconi et al .",
    "2004 ; shankar et al . 2004 ; mclure & dunlop 2004 ) . unfortunately , combining the @xmath0 relation with the observed distribution of velocity dispersions results in an estimate of the number density of black holes with @xmath9 which is considerably smaller than the estimate based on combining the @xmath1 relation with the observed luminosity function ( tundo et al .",
    "the fundamental cause of the discrepancy is that the luminosity and velocity dispersion functions are obtained from the sdss ( blanton et al .",
    "2003 ; sheth et al .",
    "2003 ) , but the @xmath2 relation in the sdss ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003b ) is different from that in the black hole samples ( e.g. yu & tremaine 2002 ) . in section",
    "[ why ] , we argue that the sdss @xmath2 relation is _ not _ to blame , suggesting that it is the black hole samples which are biased .        if black hole samples are indeed biased , then this bias may be physical or it may simply be a selection effect . if physical , then only a special set of galaxies host black holes , and the entire approach above ( of transforming the luminosity or velocity dispersion function ) is compromised .",
    "on the other hand , if it is a selection effect , then one is led to ask if the @xmath8observable relations currently in the literature are biased by this selection or not .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to provide a framework for describing these biases .",
    "section  [ biases ] describes monte - carlo simulations of the selection effect .",
    "it shows an example of the bias which results , and provides an analytic model of the effect .",
    "our findings are summarized in section  [ sowhat ] , where estimates of the intrinsic black hole mass function @xmath10 , and the intrinsic @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations are provided .    throughout",
    ", we assume a spatially flat background cosmology with @xmath11 and a cosmological constant .",
    "all luminosities and masses have been scaled to @xmath12  km  s@xmath13  mpc@xmath13 .",
    "this section shows that the @xmath2 relation of early - type galaxies is significantly different from that in current black hole samples .",
    "this difference exists whether @xmath3 is computed in a visual band , or in the near - infrared .",
    "since 2002 , when the bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003a ) sample was compiled , a number of systematic problems with sdss photometry and spectroscopy have been discovered . the initial ( sdss - dr1 and earlier ) photometry overestimated the luminosities and sizes of extended objects .",
    "although later releases correct for these problems , they still overestimate the sky level in crowded fields ( e.g. mandelbaum et al . 2005 ; bernardi et al .",
    "2006 ; lauer et al .",
    "2006 ) , and so they tend to underestimate the luminosities of extended objects in such fields .",
    "this problem is particularly severe for early - type galaxies in nearby clusters .",
    "in addition , the sdss slightly overestimates the velocity dispersions at small @xmath4 ( the velocity dispersions in bernardi et al .",
    "2003a differ from the values reported in the sdss database and are not biased at small @xmath4 ) .",
    "bernardi ( 2006 ) discusses an analysis of the @xmath2 which results once all these systematic effects have been corrected - for : the net effect does not significantly change the @xmath2 relation reported by bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003b ) .",
    "nevertheless , the results which follow are based on luminosities and velocity dispersions which have been corrected for all these effects . because they are not easily obtained from the sdss database , in what follows",
    ", we refer to the corrected sdss sample as the sdss - b06 sample .",
    "bernardi ( 2006 ) shows that the @xmath2 relation in the sdss - b06 sample is consistent with that in enear , the definitive sample of nearby ( within 7000  km  s@xmath13 ) early - type galaxies ( da costa et al .",
    "2000 ; bernardi et al .",
    "2002 ; alonso et al . 2003 ; wegner et al .",
    "2003 ) , provided that one accounts for the bias which arises from the fact that @xmath4 played an important role in determining @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the local ( enear ) and not so local determinations ( sdss - b06 ) of the @xmath2 relation are consistent with one another .",
    "figure  [ sigmalv ] compares the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath3 in enear and sdss - b06 with that in the recent compilations of black holes by hring & rix ( 2004 ) .",
    "the dotted line shows a fit to @xmath14 defined by the filled circles .",
    "appendix  a describes this and other black hole compilations we have consider in the following figures .",
    "it also gives the fits shown in this and the other figures .",
    "the solid line shows @xmath14 in the sdss - b06 sample .",
    "the dot - dashed line shows a determination of the enear @xmath2 relation which attempts to correct for peculiar velocity effects in the distance estimate .",
    "this correction is known to bias the @xmath14 relation towards a steeper slope ( bernardi 2006 ) .",
    "the short - dashed line shows the result of using the redshift as distance indicator when computing the enear luminosities ; while not ideal , comparison of this relation with the dot - dashed line provides some indication of the magnitude of the bias .",
    "note in particular that using the redshift as distance indicator brings the enear relation substantially closer to the sdss - b06 relation , for which the redshift is an excellent distance indicator .",
    "the agreement between enear and sdss - b06 suggests that the difference between the @xmath2 relation in the black hole sample ( dotted ) and in sdss - b06 ( solid ) can not be attributed to problems with the sdss determination .",
    "the agreement between enear and sdss - b06 , and the disagreement with the black hole samples strongly suggests that the @xmath2 relation in black hole samples is biased to larger @xmath4 for given @xmath3 , or to smaller @xmath3 for a given @xmath4 .",
    "similar conclusions are obtained if we use kormendy & gebhardt ( 2001 ) or ferrarese & ford ( 2005 ) compilations . at a given luminosity",
    ", the black hole samples have @xmath15 larger than the enear or sdss - b06 relations by @xmath16  dex . as a result of this difference",
    ", smaller luminosities can apparently produce black holes of larger mass than do their associated velocity dispersions ( e.g. , yu & tremaine 2002 ) .",
    "tundo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) show this in some detail .",
    "we have considered the possibility that the discrepancy between the @xmath2 relations may depend on wavelength .",
    "figure  [ sigmalk ] presents a similar analysis , but now the luminosities are from the @xmath17-band . in the case of the early - type sample ,",
    "the sdss - b06 sample was matched to 2mass , and then the 2mass isophotal magnitudes were brightened by 0.2  mags to make them more like total magnitudes ( kochanek et al .",
    "2001 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ) . the solid line shows the resulting @xmath18 relation .",
    "it is very similar to that in the @xmath19band if @xmath20 .",
    "marconi & hunt ( 2003 ) matched their black hole compilation to 2mass , and then recomputed the photometry to determine @xmath21 .",
    "the open triangles show the @xmath22 relation for the subset of objects which are in the hring & rix sample .",
    "the filled circles are obtained by taking these objects ( i.e. those in both marconi & hunt and hring & rix ) , and then shifting the @xmath23 based @xmath19band luminosities to @xmath17 assuming @xmath20 . dashed and",
    "dotted lines show fits to these relations .",
    "comparison with the solid line ( 2mass - b06 ) shows a significant offset ",
    "the black hole samples are different from the population of normal early - type galaxies .",
    "if black hole samples are indeed biased , then this bias may be physical or simply a selection effect .",
    "one is then led to ask if the relations currently in the literature are biased by this selection or not . to address this",
    ", we must be able to quantify how much of the @xmath0 correlation arises from the @xmath1 and @xmath24 relations , and similarly for the @xmath1 relation .",
    "our approach is to make a model for the true joint distribution of @xmath7 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and to study the effects of selection by measuring the various pairwise correlations before and after applying the selection procedure to this joint distribution .",
    "in what follows , we will use @xmath25 , and with some abuse of notation , @xmath7 to denote the logarithm of the black hole mass when expressed in units of @xmath26 and @xmath3 to denote the absolute magnitude ( since , in the current context , @xmath27 for absolute magnitude is too easily confused with mass ) .",
    "we assume that correlations between the logarithms of these quantities define simple linear relations , so our model has nine free parameters : these may be thought of as the slope , zero - point and scatter of each of the three pairwise correlations , or as the means and variances of @xmath3 , @xmath28 and @xmath7 and the three correlation coefficients @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    to illustrate , let @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the mean and rms values of @xmath28 , and use similar notation for the other two variables .",
    "then the mean @xmath28 as a function of @xmath3 satisfies @xmath34 and the rms scatter around this relation is @xmath35 the combination @xmath36 is sometimes called the slope of the @xmath37 relation , and @xmath38 is the zero - point .",
    "similarly , the slopes of @xmath39 and @xmath6 are @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "notice that the zero points are trivial if one works with quantities from which the mean value has been subtracted .",
    "we will do so unless otherwise specified .",
    "our analysis is simplified by the fact that five of the nine free parameters are known : the mean and rms values of @xmath3 and @xmath28 as well as the correlation between @xmath28 and @xmath3 have been derived from the sdss - b06 sample ( these values are similar to those reported by bernardi et al .",
    "2003b , who also show that the distribution of @xmath28 given @xmath3 is gaussian ) .",
    "hence , we use @xmath42 to make a mock catalog of the joint @xmath43 distribution in the sdss - b06 early - type galaxy sample .",
    "sheth et al . (",
    "2003 ) show explicitly that the resulting mock catalog provides luminosity and velocity dispersion functions which are consistent with those seen in the sdss .",
    "we turn this into a catalog of black hole masses by assuming that , like @xmath28 at fixed @xmath3 , the distribution of @xmath7 at fixed @xmath28 and @xmath3 is gaussian .",
    "hence , for each @xmath28 and @xmath3 , we generate a value of @xmath7 that is drawn from a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath44 and rms @xmath45 ( see , e.g. , bernardi et al .",
    "the combination @xmath46 measures how much of the correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath3 is simply a consequence of the correlations between @xmath7 and @xmath28 and between @xmath28 and @xmath3 . the combination @xmath47 can be interpreted similarly .",
    "notice again that the mean values of the three quantities mainly serve to set the zero - points of the correlations .",
    "since we are working with quantities from which the mean has been subtracted , our model for the true relations is fixed by specifying the values of @xmath48 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .            to study",
    "how selection effects might have biased the observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations we generate a mock galaxy+black hole catalog as described above , model the selection effect , and then measure the three pairwise correlations in the selection - biased catalog .",
    "figure  [ mockrels ] shows an example of the result when @xmath49    we have tried a variety of ways to specify a selection effect . in figure",
    "[ mockrels ] , we supposed that no objects with luminosities brighter than @xmath50 were selected , and that the fraction of fainter objects which are selected is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "the open diamonds in each panel show the objects in the original catalog , and the filled circles show the objects which survived the selection procedure .",
    "the panels also show the slopes of the relations before ( dashed ) and after ( solid ) selection .",
    "note that because the selection was made at fixed @xmath28 , the slope of @xmath39 in the selected sample is not changed from its original value .",
    "however , @xmath6 and @xmath37 are both steeper than before .",
    "the exact values of the change in slope depend upon our choices for the intrinsic model , for reasons we describe in the next subsection .",
    "the parameter choices given above , with the selection described above , result in zero - points , slopes ( given at top of each panel ) and scatter ( 0.22  dex , 0.33  dex and 0.05  dex in the top left , right , and bottom panels , respectively ) which are in excellent agreement with those in the hring & rix ( 2004 ) compilation ( see appendix  a ) . figure  [ simresids ] shows that residuals from these relations exhibit similar correlations to those seen in the real data ( compare figure  [ bhresids ] ; residuals from the @xmath0 relation do not correlate with @xmath4 , @xmath3 or @xmath24 residuals , so we have not shown these correlations here ) .",
    "this agreement is nontrivial : for example , it is more difficult to match all three observed correlations if the selection is based on @xmath37 rather than @xmath50 .",
    "changes in the parameter values of more than five percent produce noticable differences .    the correlations shown in the two right hand panels of figure  [ simresids ] are similar in the full and in the bias selected sample , suggesting that the selection has not altered the shape of this correlation .",
    "this suggests that the correlations seen in the right hand panel of figure  [ bhresids ] are real  they are not due to selection effects .",
    "we comment in the final section on what these correlations might imply .",
    "the result of using the biased @xmath6 relation ( both slope and scatter ) in the mock luminosity function to predict black hole abundances is shown as the dashed line in figure  [ mockcounts ] .",
    "it overpredicts the true abundances in the mock catalog , which are shown by the solid line .",
    "the dotted line shows that the analogous @xmath53based predictor is , essentially unbiased .",
    "this is not surprising in view of the results shown in figure  [ mockrels]the observed @xmath6 relation is biased towards predicting more massive black holes for a given luminosity , whereas the @xmath5 is almost completely unbiased .",
    "the hashed regions show the @xmath54 and @xmath53based predictions derived by using the relations in the appendix ( taken from tundo et al .",
    "2006 ) with the bernardi et al . ( 2003b ) luminosity function and the sheth et al .",
    "( 2003 ) velocity function .",
    "they bracket the results from our mock catalog quite accurately .",
    "note , however , that in our mock catalog , the true abundances are given by the solid line : the much larger abundances predicted from the luminosity - based approach are due to the selection effect . for reference , this intrinsic distribution is well - described by equation  ( [ phimbh ] ) .      if current black hole samples only select objects which have @xmath15 which is exactly @xmath55-standard deviations above the @xmath37 relation , then @xmath56 and inserting this in the expression above yields @xmath57 the slope of this relation is still @xmath58 ; because the selection was done at fixed @xmath3 , the slope of the observed @xmath6 relation is not biased from its true value .",
    "however , the zero - point may be strongly affected .",
    "the magnitude of the offset depends on how much of the @xmath0 relation is due to the @xmath2 and @xmath1 relations . if @xmath55 is positive ( as figure  [ sigmalv ] suggests ) and @xmath59 , then the observed relation predicts larger black hole masses for a given luminosity than would the true relation .",
    "the associated @xmath5 relation is obtained by transforming @xmath3 to @xmath28 using equation  ( [ selectv ] ) : @xmath60 both the slope and zero - point of this relation are affected , and the magnitude of the effect depends on whether or not @xmath61 . if the correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath3 is stronger(weaker ) than can be accounted for by the @xmath62 and @xmath43 relations , then the observed @xmath39 has a steeper ( shallower ) slope than the true relation , and a shifted zero - point , such that it predicts smaller ( larger ) masses for a given @xmath4 than the true relation .",
    "note that this means it is possible for _ both _ the @xmath54 and @xmath53based approaches to overestimate the true abundance of massive black holes .",
    "if the selection chooses objects with small @xmath3 for their @xmath4 , then the resulting relations are given by exchanging @xmath3s for @xmath28s in the previous two expressions .",
    "in this case , @xmath37 and @xmath6 both have biased slopes and zero points , whereas @xmath5 has the correct slope but a shifted zero - point .",
    "once again , the sign and magnitude of the bias depends on how much of the @xmath8observable correlation is due to the other two correlations . for the choice of parameters used to make the figures in the previous subsection , @xmath63 : the @xmath1 relation is almost entirely a consequence of the other two correlations .",
    "thus , this toy model shows why the @xmath5 relation shown in figure  [ mockrels ] was unbiased by the selection ( which was done at fixed @xmath4 ) .",
    "compared to the enear and sdss - b06 early - type galaxy samples , the @xmath2 correlation in black hole samples currently available is biased towards large @xmath4 for a given @xmath3 ( figures  [ sigmalv][sigmalk ] ) .",
    "if this is a selection effect rather than a physical one , then current determinations of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 relations are biased .",
    "we provided a simple toy model of the effect which shows how these biases depend on the intrinsic correlations and on the selection effect .    to illustrate its use , we constructed simple models of the intrinsic correlation and of the selection effect .",
    "we then identified a particular set of parameters which we showed can reproduce all the observed trends : the correlations between @xmath7 and @xmath3 or @xmath4 , the @xmath2 correlation in black hole samples , as well as correlations between residuals from these fits ( figures  [ mockrels ] and  [ simresids ] ) are all reproduced .",
    "we do not claim to have found the unique solution to this problem .",
    "however , if we have correctly modeled the selection effect , then our analysis suggests that the bias in the @xmath5 relation is likely to be small , whereas the @xmath6 relation is biased towards having a steeper slope ( figure  [ mockrels ] ) .",
    "this has the important consequence that estimates of black hole abundances which combine the @xmath6 relation and its scatter with an external determination of the distribution of @xmath3 will overpredict the true abundances of massive black holes .",
    "the analogous approach based on @xmath4 is much less biased ( figure  [ mockcounts ] ) .",
    "the choice of parameters which reproduces the selection - biased fits reported in appendix  a has intrinsic distribution @xmath10 that is well described @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , with @xmath68 a characteristic mass .",
    "this mass is related to the mean mass @xmath69 by @xmath70/\\gamma(\\alpha/\\beta)$ ] , so @xmath71 . since this @xmath10",
    "is based on the sdss - b06 luminosity and velocity functions , it is missing small bulges , so it is incomplete at small @xmath7 .",
    "the intrinsic correlations in the sample are @xmath72 and @xmath73 with scatter of 0.38 and 0.23  dex , respectively",
    ". a bisector fit to the @xmath1 relation would have slope @xmath74 ; a similar fit to the @xmath62 relation would have slope @xmath75 .",
    "notice that the slopes satisfy @xmath76 .",
    "this is because , for this choice of parameters , the correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath3 is almost entirely a consequence of the other two correlations .",
    "if we have correctly modelled the selection effect , and we do not claim to have done so , then our analysis suggests that the intrinsic joint distribution of @xmath7 , luminosity and @xmath4 is similar to that between color , luminosity and @xmath4 : of the three pairwise correlations , the two correlations involving @xmath4 are fundamental , whereas the third is not ( bernardi et al .",
    "2005 ) . since residuals from the @xmath14 relation are correlated with age ( bernardi et al . 2005 ) , the correlations shown in the top right panels of figures  [ simresids ] and  [ bhresids ] suggest that , at fixed luminosity , older galaxies tend to host more massive black holes than less massive galaxies . understanding why this is true may provide important insight into black hole formation and evolution .",

    "the sample was compiled as follows .",
    "we selected all objects classified as e or s0 by hring & rix ( 2004 ) in their compilation of black holes .",
    "we excluded ngc  4342 as they recommend , as well as ngc  1023 which ferrarese & ford ( 2005 ) say should be excluded because it is not sufficiently well resolved .",

    "a word on the velocity dispersions is necessary .",
    "hring & rix ( 2004 ) and marconi & hunt ( 2003 ) use the velocity dispersions provided by kormendy & gebhardt ( 2001 ) ( two galaxies in marconi & hunt have a different value ) .",

    "tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) provide a detailed discussion of aperture effects . however , it is not clear that their assumptions about the scale dependence of the stellar velocity dispersion are consistent with more recent measurements ( cappellari et al .",
    "2006 ) . since the difference in aperture is not sufficient to account for the discrepancy between black hole samples and the normal early - type galaxy samples we have not made any correction for this difference",

    "the bottom right panel suggests that these objects also tend to be faint for their @xmath4 .",
    "but whether or not these are entirely selection effects is unclear ; this is because the relations  ( [ mbhlum])([bhls ] ) are a combination of an intrinsic correlation and a selection bias , so that correlations between residuals are also combinations of true and selection - biased relations .",
    "the velocity dispersions for the early - type galaxy population were scaled from their measured values to those they are expected to have within a circular aperture of radius @xmath87 . for enear , when the observed redshift is used as the distance indicator ( i.e. no correction is made for peculiar velocities ) , @xmath91 correcting for peculiar velocities leads to a biased relation , because the correction makes @xmath3 depend on @xmath4 .",
