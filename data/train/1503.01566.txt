    "both the macro and microcell rates are found to be approximately equivalent to the full coordination case , observed by comparing fig .",
    "[ fc ] and fig .",
    "this suggests that if we can coordinate the transmission to minimize the most dominant source of interference , we are able to achieve near full coordination performance . moreover , this strategy significantly reduces the backhaul overheads by eliminating the need to equip the microcell bss with out - of - cell csi .",
    "[ niti ] depicts the mean per - cell sum rate performance given by ( [ sr1 ] ) vs. macrocell snr of the no inter - tier interference coordination strategy .",
    "due to zero cross - tier interference , this strategy results in superior mean per - cell sum rate performance in comparison with the other coordination strategies .",
    "it is worth comparing fig .",
    "[ niti ] to fig .",
    "[ fc ] , and noting that the mean sum rate performance of full coordination approaches the performance of no inter - tier interference .",

    "[ mpusinr ] , where we plot the mean per - user sinr as a function of the number of microcells .",
    "we observe that the mean per - user sinr decreases linearly with increasing number of microcells .",
    "when the number of microcells is less than 5 , there is a marginal difference between macro only coordination and full coordination mean per - user sinr .",
    "this suggests that at low microcell density , it is advantageous to avoid paying the high price of backhaul overheads for full coordination performance .",
    "when there are more than 5 microcells , the gap between full coordination and macro - only coordination techniques starts to increase . approximately , a @xmath71 db difference in the mean per - user sinr is seen with @xmath37 microcells in the system .",
    "the difference in the slopes of the various strategies demonstrates the impact of bs coordination in a hetnet with network densification .",
    "thus , coordination arrests the rate of decay of the mean per - user sinr in a hetnet .",
    "in addition to the above , the result demonstrates the validity of the approximated mean per - user sinr in ( [ msinr2 ] ) .",
    "these are shown to closely match the simulated mean per - user sinr performance for all the coordination techniques .",

    "the microcell sum rate increases linearly with the number of microcells , as majority of the interference is being suppressed by the leakage based beamformers .",
    "a similar trend can be observed for the macro only coordination case , however the microcell sum rate performance gains are lower compared to the full coordination case as the number of microcells increases .",
    "the no coordination case suffers from strong macro and other microcell interference resulting in a saturated sum rate at higher number of microcells .",
    "we now study the effect of deploying multiple macrocell bss on the microcell sum rate performance . for comparison purposes , we consider scenarios with both single and three overlapping macrocells with inter - site distances of @xmath32 km . in both cases ,",
    "a maximum of @xmath37 microcell bss are randomly dropped at the edge of the macrocell at a radius of @xmath73 , such that the minimum distance between successive microcell bss is @xmath68 .",
    "[ mrp2 ] shows the mean microcell sum rate as a function of the number of microcells for both the single and three macrocell bss cases at a snr of 10db .",
    "it is seen that the sum rate of the single macrocell bs case is significantly higher than the three overlapping macrocell bs case .",
    "this is due to higher aggregate intercell interference resulting from other macrocells and microcells located within these macrocells .",
    "compared to fig .",
    "[ mrp ] where the microcells are randomly placed anywhere within the macrocell coverage area , the no coordination performance benefits the most from the microcells being deployed at the edge of the macrocell .",
    "this can be seen from the mean sum rate , as it shows a linear growth up to 7 microcells in comparison with 3 microcells .",
    "we also observe that the improvement in mean sum rate with cell edge deployment of microcells is higher for the no coordination strategy . at 10 microcells ,",
    "the increase in the mean sum rate for the full coordination strategy is approximately 3.6 bps / hz , while the increase with no coordination is about 10 bps / hz .",
    "in this paper , we demonstrate the rate gains provided by bs coordination in hetnets . with bs coordination , the sum rate is seen to increase linearly and the mean per - user sinr decreases linearly with the number of microcells .",

    "<S> in this paper we demonstrate the rate gains achieved by two - tier heterogeneous cellular networks ( hetnets ) with varying degrees of coordination between macrocell and microcell base stations ( bss ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that without the presence of coordination , network densification does not provide any gain in the sum rate and rapidly decreases the mean per - user signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratio ( sinr ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that coordination reduces the rate of sinr decay with increasing numbers of microcell bss in the system . </S>",
    "<S> validity of the analytically approximated mean per - user sinr over a wide range of signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) is demonstrated via comparison with the simulated results . </S>"
