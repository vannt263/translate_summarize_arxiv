    "flights of a flock of birds or a swarm of bees are well known examples of living systems exhibiting collective behavior which are often modeled by groups of self - propelled mobile agents @xcite .",
    "these groups are called ` cohesive ' since each agent maintains a characteristic distance from other agents and at the same time they are ` coherent ' since all agents move along a common direction .",
    "in addition , the internal structure and organization of a flock is found to be complex and far from being static .",
    "examples include leader - follower relationships in bird flocks @xcite , fission - fusion events in fish schools @xcite and social groups in human crowd @xcite .",
    "such flocks often travel over long duration covering distances much larger than the size of the flocks along arbitrary directions and therefore effectively an infinite amount of space is available to the flock for it s motion .",
    "it is also known that while individual agents often change their directions of flight the whole flock maintains motion along the same direction in a stable fashion .",

    "to summarize , we have studied a simple model of the collective behavior of @xmath4 interacting mobile agents which travel in the open free space . in this model",
    "we have incorporated the observation of the starflag experiment which advocates the necessity of using the topological distance instead of the metric distance .",
    "each agent interacts with a group of @xmath0 selected agents around it who are positioned within an interaction zone .",
    "every agent freshly selects at a certain rate the group of agents within the iz .",
    "the selection criterion is to choose the first @xmath0 neighbors . in this paper",
    "we have studied two limiting situations , i.e. , when the refreshing rates are fastest and the slowest .",
    "we first studied when the refreshing rate is slowest i.e. , when the iz for each agent is determined at the beginning and is never updated .",
    "all the agents follow the interaction rule in vicsek model .",
    "it has been observed that in absence of noise , starting from a small localized region of space the agents gradually spread as time passes , so that after some relaxation time the flock arrives at a stationary state .",
    "the most prominent stationary states are the single sink state and the cyclic state . using numerical methods",
    "we claim that the frequencies of occurrence of other stationary states like the distributed sink states , cycloid states and the space - filling states goes to zero as the neighbor number increases to about 8 . beyond @xmath5",
    "only the sss and cs states dominate . finally as @xmath0 approaches the flock size @xmath4 , only the sss states dominate .",
    "interestingly , it has also been observed that the actual metric distances of the @xmath0 topological neighbors do not become arbitrarily large in all these stationary states in absence of noise . for",
    "the sss states it is true exactly . for the cyclic states",
    "also the topological neighbors remain within a finite distance from an agent ( see fig .",
    "12 ) . moreover , when the refreshing rate is the fastest , every fragmented cluster travels in a single sink state .",
    "therefore , it is this close proximity of the neighbors that gives rise to the cohesiveness present in our model .",
    "further , on the application of noise a crossover takes place from the ballistic motion to the diffusive motion and the crossover time depends on the strength of the noise @xmath1 , which diverges as @xmath2 .",
    "further the calculation of the order parameter @xmath6 and the binder cumulant @xmath7 lead us to estimate the critical noise @xmath8 required for the continuous transition from the ordered to the disordered phase . secondly , when the refreshing rate is fastest , each agent freshly determines its neighbors in the interaction zone at every time step . in the stationary state",
    "the flock gets fragmented into a number of smaller clusters of different sizes .",
    "the agents in a cluster move completely coherently , different cluster has different direction of motion .",
    "a simpler version of the model has also been studied in the limit of the speed @xmath9 when the positions of spins are completely frozen at the sites of a square lattice , but their orientational angles @xmath10 evolve with time again by the vicsek interaction . here for @xmath0 = 4 the spin configuration is completely static . on the other hand for @xmath0 = 2 and 3 , the entire spin configuration moves along the diagonal and parallel to the asymmetry axis respectively .",
    "further we have observed that the density of vortex - antivortex pairs increases with the strength of the noise and fits to a nice finite - size scaling behavior .",
    "overall , our findings suggest that complex spatio - temporal patterns may emerge in the interplay between an underlying network structure and collective motion .",
    "we believe that our study would also be relevant in the general problem of consensus development in networked agents @xcite and as such issues like undesired synchronization observed in real - world networks @xcite .",
    "we observed that multiple frequencies develop during oscillations of different dynamical variables . whether there is a possibility that a cascade of frequencies develop eventually leading to chaotic behavior",
    "remains an open question .",
