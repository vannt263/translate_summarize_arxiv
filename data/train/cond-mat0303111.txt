    "one of the interesting phenomenon in the vortex system of high temperature superconductors ( hts ) is the second - peak ( sp ) effect , which represents an anomalous increase of critical current with the increase of magnetic field . for the strong layered superconductor bi-2212 ,",
    "it has already been pointed out that the sp may originate from the phase transition between a quasi - ordered bragg glass ( bg ) and a disordered vortex phase@xcite .",
    "the existence of bg has been supported by neutron scatting experiments@xcite , but it is a long standing question about what is the nature of the disordered vortex phase in high field region .",
    "some literatures@xcite reported that a 3d vortex glass ( vg ) exists above the second peak field and the flux dynamics is elastic with a diverging barrier in the small current limit .",
    "the vortex glass is assumed to melt into vortex liquid at a temperature @xmath8@xcite , around which a scaling behavior of e - j curves is given . on the other hand",
    "it was predicted from numerical simulation that a plastic deformation will occur via the proliferation of vortex defects in high field region@xcite .",
    "similarly vortex dislocations are supposed to exist above the sp field@xcite , and kierfeld _ et al . _",
    "concluded that the disordered vortex phase and vortex liquid will be thermodynamically indistinguishable after the critical endpoint of the first - order melting ( fot ) line@xcite .",
    "experimentally miu _",
    "et al._@xcite claimed the existence of plastic vortex creep above the second magnetization peak based on the data measured at a single temperature t = 25 k. it remains , however , unclear whether this plastic phase appears in the high field region for all temperatures . in this paper",
    "we will show clear evidence that the flux motion above the sp field is dominated by plastic motion with a finite barrier in the small current limit .",
    "several bi-2212 single crystals with typical size of @xmath9 and thickness of @xmath10 were used in the experiment .",
    "all of them are optimal doped or slightly overdoped with @xmath11 and @xmath12 determined in resistive measurement .",
    "the samples were measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm 8 t , oxford 3001 ) and a superconducting quantum interfere device ( squid , quantum design , mpms5.5 ) . in all measurements the magnetic field h was applied parallel to the c - axis and the magnetization data were collected in the field descending process in order to eliminate the surface barrier . each sample shows similar results , therefore we will not distinguish them for convenience .",
    "fig . [ fig1 ] shows the relationship between the width of the magnetization - hysteresis - loops ( mhl ) @xmath13 and @xmath14 in double - logarithmic coordinates .",
    "an interesting feature is that each curve has a dip , as indicated by the dotted line in fig . 1 .     at t = 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14,16 , 18 , 20 , 22 , 24 , 26 k from top to bottom .",
    "the dotted line indicates the dip of each curve .",
    "the sp is very clear as pointed by the arrow at 22k . ]",
    "the dip field decreases with the increase of temperature and finally drops to the valley field associated with the sp at 22 k and keeps stable at higher temperatures .",
    "recently we have pointed out that the sp field reappears and is independent of temperature well below 20 k@xcite , thus the dips at low temperatures must have no direct relation with the sp in respect that the dip fields ( @xmath15 oe when @xmath16 k ) are much higher than the sp field ( about 280 oe for this sample ) .     and",
    "q at t = 10 k. four regions corresponding to different vortex dynamical properties are marked by i , ii , iii and iv .",
    "the inset in ( b ) gives the @xmath17 curves at 17 k measured with different field sweep rates : 100 , 50 , 20 , 10 , 5 , 1 , 0.3 oe / s .",
    "it is clear that the dip has a dynamical feature and merges to the valley position of sp at higher temperatures . ]    .",
    "[ fig2 ]    in order to find out the underlying physics corresponding to the dip on @xmath18 , we have measured the dynamical relaxation rate defined as @xmath19 by using different field sweep rates@xcite .",
    "it has been proved that @xmath20 determined in the dynamical relaxation process is equivalent to the conventional relaxation rate defined as @xmath21 .",
    "the results are given in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) . just like the dip on each @xmath18 curve",
    ", each @xmath22 curve shows a peak . for having a deeper insight to these features , we plot @xmath20 and @xmath13 vs. @xmath14 at 10 k together in fig . [",
    "fig2](b ) .",
    "it is found that each @xmath23 curve can be divided into four parts marked as i , ii , iii and iv . in region",
    "i , both @xmath13 and @xmath20 are flat , i.e. , independent of the magnetic field . in region ii , @xmath20 increases monotonously with the increase of magnetic field , and @xmath13 begins to drop .",
    "while in region iii , @xmath20 decreases with the increase of magnetic field , and the dropping rate of @xmath13 becomes slower and thus results in the dip in mhls .",
    "therefore , the dip on mhl is directly related to the peak on the @xmath23 curve . the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) gives the @xmath24 curves of another sample at 17 k and different field sweep rates .",
    "it is clear that the dip field moves to lower value when the field sweep rate decreases ( corresponding to smaller current ) and finally merges to the valley field of sp .",
    "hence both of the dip on @xmath18 and the peak on @xmath22 have dynamical features and should disappear above the sp field in the small current limit in low temperature region . after decreasing in region iii , @xmath20 upturns and increases monotonously with the field up to the irreversibility field @xmath25 ( @xmath26@xcite)in region iv . due to the dynamical feature of the dip and peak mentioned above",
    ", it can be expected that the region iv will dominate the whole @xmath27 phase diagram above the sp field in long time or small current limit . after checking about 10 pieces of bi-2212 single crystals",
    ", it is assured that the dip and peak feature appears in all samples without one exception .",
    "in fact , cohen _ et al . _ have observed the same dip and peak phenomena in bi-2212 .",
    "they related the peak in @xmath20 to the penetration field@xcite . since the peak can still be found if we consider only the descending branch of mhls , which strongly indicates that there is no relation between the peak and the penetration field .    for bi-2212 single crystals",
    ", it was found that the geometrical barrier plays an important role on the magnetization in the field ascending process@xcite .",
    "the total irreversible magnetic moment of the sample is contributed by both the surface shielding current from the geometrical barrier and the bulk screening current in the field ascending process when the external field is not high . in this case local magnetic measurement using either the tiny hall probe@xcite or magneto - optical technique@xcite were suggested . while when the external field is much higher than the second peak field , the contribution from the bulk current is much larger than that from the geometrical barrier and a quasi - bean critical state model",
    "is assumed to be valid@xcite .",
    "this is essentially true in the field descending process when h is decreased from a high field to a field which is still higher than the second peak field .",
    "no superposition of the magnetic moment due to the bulk current and the surface shielding current are expected here . as mentioned before our magnetization relaxation measurement was conducted in the field descending process with the external field above the second peak field .",
    "therefore it is justified for us to derive the bulk screening current density @xmath28 from the magnetization .",
    "it has already been pointed out that the @xmath29 curve can be obtained by assuming @xmath30 and @xmath31@xcite .",
    "[ fig3](a ) shows the @xmath29 curves at 1 t based on this method .",
    "all the curves above 12 k are obvious concave , suggesting a finite linear resistance .",
    "worthy of noting is that the irreversibility temperature @xmath32 at 1 t is about 30 k. this is a strong evidence that the vortex motion in region iv is not elastic . in order to check whether the vortex glass exists below 12 k ,",
    "a naive idea is to treat 12 k as the vortex glass melting temperature @xmath8 and scale the @xmath29 curves using 3d or quasi-2d glass theory@xcite .",
    "the scaled curve looks not good and the critical exponents are unreasonably large , e.g. , @xmath33 , which is commonly believed to be less than 2@xcite .",
    "hence we fit it to the 2d vg theory@xcite , which predicts @xmath34 . according to 2d vg theory",
    "the correlation length @xmath35 diverges at @xmath36 k , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the 2d vg exponent and the spacing of the vortex lattice respectively ; @xmath40 is the core energy of a vortex segment of length d. the linear resistivity @xmath41 due to thermal activation is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a characteristic temperature of the same order of magnitude as @xmath40 , and @xmath44 .",
    "therefore we can scale the @xmath29 data as follows@xcite ,    @xmath45    where g is an universal scaling function .",
    "the scaled result with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 is given in fig.[fig3](b ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the values found here are very close to those found for very thin @xmath49 films and @xmath50 thin films at a high magnetic field.@xcite above 12 k , all data collapse onto one branch , while the deviation begins at about 12 k. this deviation accords with the behavior of @xmath4 ( shown below ) which turns from negative to positive around 12 k. in fact , we can find the same result if scaling the data based on plastic creep theory@xcite .",
    "this is not strange if we recall that the plastic creep theory assumes also a correlation length @xmath51 diverging at 0 k , @xmath52 , and a linear resistivity when @xmath28 approaches zero , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the plastic pinning barrier@xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the flux motion in region iv is plastic .",
    "this indicates that the vortex glass phase which is characterized by a diverging activation barrier in the small current limit may not exist in region iv .",
    "actually , miu _ et al .",
    "_ have also found the plastic vortex creep above sp , but their claim was made for only a single temperature ( t = 25 k ) .",
    "curves determined from the relaxation data at h = 1 t and t = 18 , 16 , 14 , 12 k from left to right .",
    "the @xmath32 at 1 t is about 30 k. the linear lines are drawn to help identifying the curvature of these curves .",
    "( b ) scaling the @xmath29 data at h = 5 koe and t from 5 to 20 k step 0.5 k according to 2d vg or plastic theory with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath55 .",
    "the scaling fails below 12 k , as indicated by the arrow .",
    "the inset of ( b ) gives the u(j ) dependence determined by the maley s method . ]     and the exponent @xmath4 at ( a ) @xmath56 = 12 k and @xmath14 = 10 to 10000 oe , ( b ) @xmath14 = 500 oe and @xmath56 = 5 to 25 k for another sample@xcite .",
    "the linear approach in low temperature region as shown by the arrow in ( b ) suggests that there is weak effect of quantum tunnelling creep . ]",
    "an important parameter characterizing the vortex dynamics is the exponent @xmath4 , which can be derived from the conventional magnetic relaxation measurement .",
    "et al._@xcite assumed a general pinning barrier @xmath57 $ ] from which thompson _ et al .",
    "_ gave an interpolation formula to obtain @xmath4@xcite ,    @xmath58    where @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be treated as constants approximately .",
    "to obtain @xmath4 values we have measured @xmath61 vs. time by squid and the calculated results at @xmath62k and various fields are given in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , in which the conventional magnetic relaxation rate @xmath21 is also given . to avoid the geometrical barrier in the field penetration process ,",
    "each measurement was done as following : the field is raised to 5.5 t and then lowered to the expected field .",
    "it is clear that @xmath4 is negative in region iv .",
    "a negative @xmath4 indicates a finite @xmath63 when @xmath28 approaches to zero , thus conflicts with the vortex glass theory .",
    "the @xmath64 and @xmath65 curves have very similar feature as @xmath66 and @xmath67 , as shown in fig . [ fig4](b ) for another sample with @xmath68 around 380 oe@xcite .",
    "the negative @xmath4 values found here corroborate the picture that the vortex motion in region iv is plastic .",
    "next we try to clarify the origin of a positive @xmath4 value and the drop of @xmath20 with increasing field in region iii .",
    "et al . _ have measured the ac susceptibility of @xmath69 and found the elastic ( el ) creep in some part of the disordered phase@xcite , which is explained as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the dimension of the creeping vortex bundle and @xmath72 is the mean distance between two dislocations .",
    "therefore , we attribute the vortex motion in region iii to the 2d el too . it was predicted that @xmath73 above the sp field@xcite , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the critical current separating the 2d el creep and the variable - range - hopping regions ( vrh ) .",
    "assuming @xmath76 , taking @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 when @xmath79 .",
    "it is thus tempting to relate the positive @xmath4 value as an evidence of 2d el creep .",
    "these regions are marked on the u(j ) curves respecting to different current values in the insert of fig.3(b ) . by further lowering t and/or h ( increasing j ) the optimal hopping distance @xmath80 will be smaller than @xmath81 eventually , and the vrh process will take place , leading to the fast increase of @xmath82 with h and t in region ii .",
    "it is interesting to mention that in @xmath49 crystals with columnar defects thompson _",
    "et al._@xcite found the similar peak on s(t ) curve and dip on @xmath83 curve , which was also interpreted as the crossover from elastic creep to vrh .",
    "it is yet , however , to be understood why the @xmath4 values determined in region i and ii are negative .",
    "there are two possibilities for the negative @xmath4 values in regions i and ii : ( 1)the total magnetic moment in the time window we used varies too little for the program to fit and get a valid and physical meaningful @xmath4 value ( for region ii ) ; ( 2)a superposition of the bulk current and the geometrical surface current may occur in region i. although all these hypotheses about the dynamical processes in regions i , ii and iii need further clarification , it seems quite certain that the region iv has a feature of plastic creep ( pl ) and it will become dominant above the sp field throughout whole temperature region in the small current limit ( shown by the inset of fig.2(b ) ) .",
    "[ fig5 ] gives the phase diagram of bi-2212 .",
    "el and vrh region will gradually reduce when @xmath28 decreases , and the whole region ( shown by the shaded area ) above sp field is dominated by plastic creep ultimately with @xmath84 .",
    "is determined from the deviating point on the m(t ) curves measured in the zfc - fc processes .",
    "the @xmath68 is taken from our earlier data@xcite and shown as the square symbol .",
    "the boundaries between pl , el and vrh are determined from the peak and valley positions of @xmath20 in fig .",
    "2(a ) . in small current limit ,",
    "the el and vrh region will disappear and the whole region above sp field becomes plastic . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have found a general dip on @xmath85 and @xmath86 curves and peak on @xmath2 and @xmath3 curves .",
    "they have dynamical features and are explained as the crossovers between different vortex phases .",
    "plastic flux motion is found to be dominant far below the irreversibility line and takes over the whole region above the sp field in the small current limit .",
