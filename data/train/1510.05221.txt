    "nanomechanical devices have attracted broad interest as they hold promise to find potential applications in fundamental tests of quantum behavior of macroscopic objects , ultrasensitive detection , and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the exceptional mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) , their large young modulus , and low masses on the order of the attogram , make them to be the most conspicuous among all kind of available nanomechanical systems , because these properties result in high resonance frequency and large zero - point motion , which make it possible to greatly enhance the quantum operation speed and to relieve the demanding experimental conditions for ground - state cooling and state readout .",
    "moreover , carbon - based systems have many fascinating features for quantum information processing . in a variety of systems like gaas",
    ", the hyperfine interplay between electron and nuclear spins contributes the leading source of electron spin decoherence , which heavily hinders the qubit performance of the single electron spins in a quantum dot defined in these systems .",
    "in contrast , we can grow carbon - based systems with pure @xmath0c which is free of net nuclear spin , to completely remove the hyperfine - interaction induced decoherence .",
    "moreover , compared with phonon continuum in bulk materials which imposes main restrictions on the improvement of the electron spin coherence time , the phonon spectrum of a suspended cnt is discretized and can be designed to have a a remarkably low density of states , enabling very long spin lifetimes when the spin energy splitting is off - resonance with the phonon modes . at the same time we can obtain strong spin - phonon coupling for quantum information processing such as qubit rotation , quantum state transfer , or generating entangled states , by prompting the spin splitting resonant with a high - q discrete phonon mode .    quantum control of the state of an electron spin",
    "is generally accomplished by a resonant oscillating magnetic field .",
    "however , it has been proven to be challenging to generate strong oscillating magnetic field in a semiconductor device by specially designed microwave cavities @xcite or microfabricated striplines @xcite .",
    "in contrast , it is far easier to produce electric field by simply exciting a local gate electrode . furthermore , electric field provides much higher spatial selectivity , which is essential for local individual spin manipulation .",
    "electrical control of a spin - based system for quantum information processing @xcite is thus highly desirable .",
    "recently literature @xcite theoretically shows that electric spin control and coupling is viable with bends in cnts .",
    "the deflection in a cnt can also lead to strong coupling between an electron spin in a quantum dot and the vibrational motion of the cnt @xcite .",
    "however the suggested spin - phonon coupling is difficult to modulate when the setup has been shaped up .",
    "here we propose a scheme for electrical control of the spin - phonon coupling in cnts .",
    "the deflection due to the vibration motion of a suspended cnt couples the cnt vibration motion to an electron spin confined in a lateral cnt quantum dot ( qd ) .",
    "the spin - phonon coupling is dependent on the electron density distribution in the qd .",
    "an electrical field along the nanotube shifts the effective center of the qd , thus modifies the density distribution , leading to the corresponding electrical control of the spin - phonon strength .",
    "note that the spin - phonon coupling can be easily turn off through the electric field , eliminating the phonon mechanism of decoherence .",
    "numerical simulations show that the high fidelity quantum state transfer between mechanical and spin qubits driven by electrical pulses is within the reach of current technique .",
    "recent experimental advance in fabrication of lateral cnt qd provides the basis for the physical implementation of our proposal @xcite .",
    "our results provide the basis for the electrical control of light - spin quantum interface and for manufacturing electrically driven quantum information processing systems .",

    "in the setup shown in fig . [ fig1 ] the suspended cnt confines an electron with a lateral quantum dot . here we consider most experimentally relevant regime @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the energy gap between the valence band and the conduction band , @xmath5 is the energy level difference arising from the longitudinal confining potential of the quantum dot , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the energy changes caused by the external magnetic field , the spin - orbit coupling , and the intervalley interplay , respectively @xcite . if a magnetic field of magnitude around [ eq1 ] b^= , is applied along the longitudinal direction of the cnt , the system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] can be treated as a spin qubit coupled to a nanomechanical oscillator mode with the following hamiltonian @xcite [ eq2 ] h=_s_3+g(a+a^)_1+_r a^a , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the electronic orbit and spin magnetic moments , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the spin - orbit and intervalley couplings , @xmath13 is the tunable spin qubit splitting , and @xmath14 is the frequency of the fundamental bending mode of the cnt described by the annihilation operator @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 are pauli matrices operating on the two - level spin spaces . here",
    "the spin - phonon coupling g=_u_0/2 is independent of the magnetic field @xmath17 along the cnt , @xmath18 is the average of the derivative of the waveform @xmath19 of the phonon mode against the electron density profile @xmath20 in the qd , and @xmath21 is the amplitude of the zero - point fluctuations of the phonon mode .     ( a )",
    "the dimensionless waveform @xmath19 of the phonon mode under consideration with normalization @xmath22 .",
    "( b ) the spin - phonon coupling @xmath23 versus the effective center of the lateral cnt qd @xmath24 .",
    "see text for details.,width=302 ]    the first flexural eigenmode of the cnt clamped at both sides @xmath25 and @xmath26 has the form @xcite [ eq3 ] f(z)=kz - kz+(kz - kz ) , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath19 is normalized to @xmath29 .",
    "the confinement potential for the lateral qd embedded in a cnt can be modelled as a parabolic potential @xcite [ eq4 ] m^_0(z - z_c)^2 , where @xmath30 is the effective mass of the electron and @xmath1 is the characteristic harmonic oscillator frequency , @xmath31 is the center of the parabolic well .",
    "assuming that the electron in the lateral cnt qd is in the ground state , the electron density profile @xmath20 has the form @xcite [ eq5 ] n(z)= , where @xmath32 .    because the spin - phonon coupling @xmath23 is dependent on the electron density profile @xmath20",
    ", we can modulate the spin - phonon coupling strength by altering the electron distribution in the qd .",
    "for this reason an electric field is applied along the longitudinal direction of the cnt ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] a ) .",
    "this electric field does not modify the energy level spacing of the quantum dot , but does shift the effective center of the quantum dot to @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "as an example we consider the case where the qd is located at the midpoint of the cnt , @xmath34 . with realistic parameters at hand @xcite , @xmath35 nm , @xmath36 pm , @xmath37ev , @xmath38",
    ", we find the relation between the spin - phonon coupling @xmath23 and the effective center of the qd shown in fig.[fig2]b .",
    "the maximum magnitude of @xmath23 is about 0.961 mhz .",
    "carbon nanotube resonators with high resonance frequencies of several hundred megahertz and a high q exceeding @xmath39 have been reported in @xcite . for a resonator of frequency @xmath40mhz and mechanical quality factor",
    "@xmath41 we have a resonator damping rate @xmath42 hz@xmath43 . even in bulk materials such as a one - electron gaas qd literatures @xcite report spin dephasing rate @xmath44 of several hz , at the same time near - zero density of state of other phonon modes of a cnt at @xmath13 can further lower the spin dephasing rate , resulting in a reasonable assumption @xmath45 .",
    "thus the spin - mechanical coupling strength @xmath23 far exceeds the damping rate @xmath46 , bringing the hybrid system into the so - called ",
    "strong coupling \" regime .    in the following discussions",
    "the resonance condition , @xmath47 is assumed . applying the rotating wave approximation",

    "to evaluate the system s performance in the anticipated parameter regime , we study the quantum state transfer process of the system with a master equation which includes the unavoidable decoherence .",
