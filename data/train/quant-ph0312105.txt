    "one of the most important resources in quantum information processing is the interaction between different quantum systems , such as those possessed by remote parties or registers of a quantum computer .",
    "these systems evolve jointly according to some interaction hamiltonian .",
    "good methods to convert such interaction into other useful resources , using a well motivated set of control operations , are of paramount importance .",
    "a common framework for studying such conversions involves a system of @xmath0 qubits ( or higher dimensional registers ) with _ unlimited local control_. sophisticated methods for various tasks were developed .",
    "for example , in a system coupled by _ simultaneous _ arbitrary pairwise interactions , one can extract the interaction on a select pair of qubits @xcite , which can be used to provide a coupling gate or entanglement .",
    "these methods typically approximate the desired task by interspersing the free hamiltonian evolution with local operations .",
    "the required amount of local resources can be reflected by the frequency of manipulations , and an error parameter is given by the interval between them .",
    "in general , the task is approximated to first order of this time interval , though sometimes the exact task can be performed without excessive local resources ( for examples , see @xcite for logic gate construction , and @xcite for state transfer and entanglement generation ) .",
    "ps .    in this paper , we consider a simple but nontrivial system in which several tasks can be accomplished perfectly almost without local manipulations .",
    "we consider a spin chain with nearest neighbor coupling ; the two end spins are data qubits and other spins are mediating the indirect coupling between the data qubits . furthermore , we restrict local control to the data qubits only .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the raising and lowering operators respectively , @xmath4 are spin labels ; subscripts of operators indicate the spins being acted on , and the sum is over neighboring spin - pairs denoted by @xmath5 .",

    "the gate can perform perfect state transfer from spin 1 to 3 and also entangle spin 1 with spin 3 , leaving spin 2 unentangled.,width=6 ]    our main result is for the case of a @xmath13-spin chain ( fig.[3spins ] ) .",
    "we show how to turn the free evolution into an _",
    "exact _ effective quantum gate acting on the two data qubits without affecting the mediating spin .",
    "this gate can be used to transfer an unknown quantum state between the data spins , to create a maximally entangled state , and to communicate classical information .",
    "we also explore applications and extensions to this simple basic result .      before presenting our main result , we discuss some related works .",
    "our work is motivated by @xcite that study quantum state transfer and entanglement distribution in a spin chain of @xmath14 spins under the _ free _ evolution according to the hamiltonian @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "perfect ( near perfect ) state transfer between the remotest spins are only allowed for a 4-spin closed ( open ) chain @xcite , apart from the trivial case of 2 spins .",
    "our work is also motivated by @xcite , which considers a similar @xmath13-spin chain with only nearest neighbor coupling .",
    "they found mixed separable initial states such that the two remote spins become entangled by the hamiltonian without ever entangling the mediating spin .",
    "they also proved that such phenomenon is impossible for pure states . in our system , the mediating spin is entangled during the process , but is completely disentangled from the data qubits at the end , leaving the data qubits maximally entangled .",
    ".    our work can also find application in the quantum computation scheme in @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite investigated effective gates between non - neighboring spins in a heisenberg spin chain ( [ h1 ] ) with untunable couplings .",
    "our result is an analog in the xy model ( [ hgen ] ) , and has the merit of producing a much simpler two - qubit gate ( the composition of a swap gate and a controlled - phase gate ) compared to @xcite .",
    "time optimal construction of indirect @xmath17-qubit gates , such as swap or cnot , is considered in @xcite .",
    "our approach is different in requiring no local manipulations , and also in obtaining an exact implementation of the gate .",
    "ps .    during the initial preparation of our manuscript , related works @xcite were reported independently by christandl _",
    "et al_. they considered perfect quantum state transfer over more general spin networks ( besides linear chains ) under the same hamiltonian .",
    "when the interaction strength is homogeneous , i.e. @xmath18 , they found that perfect state transfer is possible only between the two ends of an @xmath19 or @xmath13 linear chain , or between the antipoles for a hypercube . when the coupling strength can be suitably tuned , perfect state transfer is possible for any linear chain .",
    "extensions to a heisenberg chain was considered when a tunable , local magnetic field can be applied to each spin . our motivating scheme in sec .",
    "[ sec:3pins - motivate ] coincides with the @xmath20 case of @xcite , which also motivated some extensions in sec .",
    "[ sec : largen ] for longer chains .",
    "our work differs in explicitly considering the evolution on all three spins ( instead of a subspace relevant to quantum state transfer as considered in @xcite ) .",
    "we exploit different initial configurations that result in more flexibility and better efficiencies in tasks other than state transfer , beyond immediate implications of the ability to perform state transfer .",
    "the hamiltonian for our @xmath13-spin chain is simply @xmath21 we first motivate our result by considering quantum state transfer , say , from the first to the last spin : @xmath22 suppose the initial state of the first spin is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "the initial state of the three spins can be written in the form , @xmath25 the state will evolve , under the hamiltonian ( [ h2 ] ) , as @xmath26 where the first term is not affected by the hamiltonian because @xmath27 .",

    "we make use of the special properties of the raising and lowering operators to obtain @xmath28 using , the taylor series expansion can be evaluated explicitly @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "when @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 and @xmath34 perfect state transfer is then obtained by applying the local unitary operator @xmath35 to the last spin .      to obtain our key result and to better understand the above scheme , we examine the full matrix representation of the unitary operator @xmath36 , with the basis ordered as @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , [ ugate ] u & = & (    cccccccc 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1    ) .",
    "the subspaces spanned by @xmath45 and @xmath46 are _ invariant _ under @xmath47 . thus restricting @xmath47 to either subspace forms an effective two - qubit gate for the remote spins @xmath48 and @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , we can consider the restriction @xmath49 of @xmath47 to the `` @xmath45 subspace , '' @xmath50 which is a composition of the swap gate and a `` joint - phase - gate '' diag@xmath51 that is equivalent to the controlled-@xmath52 acting on spins @xmath48 and @xmath13 ( up to renaming of basis states and an overall sign ) .",

    ".  [ sec:3pins - motivate ] , spin @xmath13 is initialized as @xmath53 ; the effect of the joint - phase - gate can be reverted by the _",
    "@xmath54 , so that the net effect is to swap spins @xmath48 and @xmath13 , resulting in perfect state transfer .      equation ( [ umatrix ] ) shows that perfect state transfer ( up to an irrelevant overall `` @xmath56 '' sign ) can be performed without the final local gate @xmath54 , if spin @xmath17 and spin @xmath13 are initialized to be @xmath57 instead of @xmath58 .",
    "( alternatively , we can also initialize them to be @xmath59 . )",
    "thus , barring initialization of spins @xmath17 and @xmath13 , no local manipulation is required at all ! as a final remark , state transfer due to is coherent , thus it is _ entanglement - preserving _ and in particular , @xmath60 for any joint state @xmath61 on spin 1 and an ancillary system @xmath62 of arbitrary dimension .",
    "the ability to transfer a certain amount of quantum information from one end of a spin chain to another obviously implies the ability to transfer at least as much classical communication , and to _ share _ at least as much entanglement ( in units of ebit ) between the two ends when the transfer is entanglement preserving . in this section , we present communication and entanglement sharing or generation schemes ( they differ by whether entanglement is distributed or created ) that outperform the above obvious methods .",
    "equation ( [ umatrix ] ) suggests a simple method for bidirectional classical communication  @xcite between spins @xmath48 and @xmath13 .",
    "suppose spins @xmath48 and @xmath13 are in the possession of alice and bob respectively .",
    "spin @xmath17 is in the control of the communication company who initializes the spin to @xmath45 but does nothing otherwise .",
    "since @xmath49 acts exactly as a swap gate on classical states , alice and bob can each send one classical bit to the other .",
    "note that the combined communication rate is twice the rate of quantum state transfer and that the qualitative ability to communicate simultaneously in both direction is not implied from the ability to perform quantum state transfer .",
    "equation ( [ umatrix ] ) also suggests an obvious method for creating entanglement between spins @xmath48 and @xmath13  the gate @xmath49 creates one ebit starting from the initial product state @xmath63 , where @xmath64 .",
    "as @xmath49 acts like the swap gate followed by the joint - phase - gate , the swap leaves the state invariant , and the joint - phase - gate takes @xmath63 to latexmath:[$\\smfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } ( |0\\>_1 |-\\>_3 - |1\\>_1    invariant under @xmath47 and is disentangled from spins @xmath48 and @xmath13 at the end .",
    "finally , @xmath49 can be used to _",
    "share _ two ebits if applied to an initial state @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are possessed by alice and bob respectively .",
    "the above methods are optimal if @xmath49 is a fixed given resource and they require no local control besides local state initialization .",
    "exactly one of the swap and the phase - gate components of @xmath49 are used in each protocol .",
    "ps .    more generally , given the hamiltonian @xmath70 , there are alternative schemes for the various tasks that do not involve implementing @xmath49 and are more efficient . for example , let @xmath71 , which can be written explicitly ( again in the basis @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) as = (    cccccccc 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 5 & -5 & 0 & 12 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & -5 & 5 & 0 & 12 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 12 & 12 & 0 + 0 & 12 & 12 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 12 & 0 & 5 & -5 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 12 & 0 & -5 & 5 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1    ) .",
    "the fourth and the fifth columns imply that @xmath72 applying @xmath70 for a period of time @xmath73 , half of that required for implementing @xmath49 , one can create a maximally entangled state from a product state , without ancillas , and with spin @xmath17 disentangled at the end .",
    "more amusingly , alice and bob can repeat the procedure indefinitely without resetting the mediating spin : let spin @xmath17 be in @xmath45 initially .",

    "by now , spin @xmath17 has evolved to @xmath46 , and according to , another maximally entangled state can be created after time @xmath73 , and so on .",
    "this requires only one initialization of the mediating spin and the ability to prepare @xmath76 and @xmath77 locally by alice and bob , and to input / output a quantum state of the data qubits at intervals separated by @xmath73 .      with the spin chain in fig .",
    "[ 3spins ] as a basic unit , an effective two - qubit gate can be obtained in a larger network of spins .",

    "in this section , we extend the above results to spin chains with @xmath91 spins .",
    "we first consider generating or sharing entanglement in inhomogeneous chains and then consider quantum state transfer for homogeneous chains .",

    "our entanglement generating or sharing schemes borrow techniques from christandl _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "our scheme takes about half of the time required for quantum state transfer .",
    "consider a chain of @xmath14 spins .",
    "we want to prepare a maximally entangled state @xmath93 between the data spins @xmath48 and @xmath14 at the two ends . when @xmath14 is odd , we find an entanglement generating scheme with a simple initial spin configuration .",
    "when @xmath14 is even , we find an entanglement sharing scheme that requires preexisting entanglement in the chain and a local magnetic field .",

    "we use a more convenient basis defined as @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and similarly for @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 . here , @xmath99 is the position of the middle spin .",
    "suppose the initial state is @xmath100 .",
    "then , hamiltonian in ( [ hgenv2 ] ) acts in the basis @xmath101 as @xmath102 the task to generate entanglement is the same as to rotate @xmath103 into @xmath104 , and it is equivalent to transferring a quantum state in a chain of length @xmath99 as solved by christandl _ et al _ @xcite . when the matrix elements @xmath105 are chosen such that @xmath106 @xmath107 when @xmath108 for a constant @xmath109 described in @xcite .",

    "we describe a similar scheme for an even number of spins , which requires an initially entangled state , and a time independent local magnetic field .",
