    "turbulent flows are commonly described in terms of their ability to transfer energy from one scale of motion to the other .",
    "the dimension of the domain plays a fundamental role in this process and two major phenomenologies are known : in 3d isotropic - homogeneous flows , the energy is preferentially transferred from the large to the small scales in a process referred to as the _ kolmogorov - richardson cascade _ @xcite . by contrast , 2d flows transfer energy from the small scales to the large scales , as the name of _ inverse cascade _ indicates @xcite .",
    "it appears that these two standard frameworks are in fact very particular cases , and a wider family of behaviors can be obtained by breaking one of the numerous symmetries of such isotropic - homogeneous flows . in realistic flows , like for instance geophysical flows , physical effects like rotation , stratification or simply geometrical confinement break isotropy by imposing a preferred direction",
    "this may result equally well in the emergence of an inverse or direct cascade @xcite .",
    "in fact , the isotropic vocabulary may no longer be adequate , and it may become necessary to describe the energy transfers in terms of the components of the wave vector parallel  @xmath0  or perpendicular  @xmath1  to the preferred direction , rather than just in terms of the modulus @xmath2 of the wave vector .",
    "rigorous analysis is made even more complicated by the introduction of a new time scale , in addition to the eddy turnover time , corresponding to the propagation of waves @xcite .",
    "the symmetry group for isotropic flows is @xmath3 ; rotation and stratification break the continuous subgroup @xmath4 into an @xmath5 symmetry , and lead to the appearance of waves . on the contrary breaking the discrete subgroup @xmath6 , or in other words the parity symmetry : @xmath7 , does not lead to such complications .",
    "the extent to which the latter symmetry is broken is measured by an invariant quantity called helicity  @xcite ( it also measures the correlation between velocity and vorticity , or the topology of the vortex lines @xcite ) ; a parity - invariant flow has vanishing helicity . in this paper",
    ", we will consider 3d turbulent flows with helical constraints , in such a way that the degree with which the parity symmetry is broken , and at which scales it is broken , can be accurately controlled .",
    "we show analytically that these constraints can lead to an inverse cascade , without imposing any additional effect like rotation or stratification .",
    "a particularly interesting case is that of maximal symmetry breaking , for which velocity and vorticity are aligned ( _ beltrami flows _ ) . in this context , the existence of an inverse cascade was shown experimentally  @xcite and numerically  @xcite , and justified phenomenologically on the basis of an analogy with 2d flows  @xcite .",
    "here , we provide additional analytical insight through an equilibrium statistical mechanics approach .    to do so , we make use of a refinement of the statistical mechanics approach initiated by lee @xcite and kraichnan @xcite .",
    "the standard approach consists in building a probability distribution on phase space based only on the invariants of the system . in the canonical framework ,",
    "the statistics of the system are encoded in the partition function , which is an integral over phase space . in this",
    "integral , the contributions from the microstates concentrating around the equilibrium macrostate dominate .",
    "thus , in order to study the statistical role of states which are only metastable , one should restrict the integral to a portion of phase space chosen in an appropriate manner , to get rid of the dominant contributions , as suggested by penrose and lebowitz  @xcite .",
    "up to now , this technique has been used mostly in the context of `` toy '' models of statistical physics , like the ising model of ferromagnetism  @xcite , the van der waals - maxwell model of the liquid - vapor transition  @xcite and variants like the widom and rowlinson model  @xcite . in this paper , we show that this technique is also relevant to investigate the different behaviors embedded in such a complex system as a turbulent flow .",
    "indeed , in many cases , nonlinear interactions transferring energy toward the small and large scales both exist and are almost in balance . the existence of an energy cascade and its direction results from a slight imbalance which may be traced back to the constraints imposed by the conservation laws .",
    "as soon as one breaks slightly the symmetries , the phase space breaks in different sets of modes with a different physical nature ; _ universality _ may even be lost and several phenomenologies may be observed depending on the repartition of the forcing in phase space ( e.g. isotropic or anisotropic , in the 2d or the 3d modes , etc ) @xcite .",
    "restricted partition functions provide a precise tool to predict theoretically these coexisting possibilities . as an example",
    ", we show here that the restricted partition functions obtained by summing over a portion of phase space defined by helical constraints related to parity symmetry breaking may lead to the existence of an inverse cascade for the energy .",
    "since , for such helically constrained flows , the helicity plays an analogous role to enstrophy in 2d flows , we also discuss the differences between the equilibrium properties of these two systems , especially the equilibrium spectrum at large @xmath2 .    in section [ 3dstatmechsec ] , we introduce the notations and recover the classical absolute equilibrium spectra for 3d helical turbulence  @xcite by computing the partition function rather than through equipartition theorems . in section",
    "[ symbreakflowssec ] , we restrict the computation of the partition function to submanifolds defined by helical constraints .",
    "section [ maxsymbreaksec ] is devoted to beltrami flows which maximally break the parity symmetry ; we describe in details the different regimes which arise at statistical equilibrium and discuss the analogy with 2d flows . in section [ infsymbreaksec ] , we investigate the effect of weaker helical constraints and show that the condition for the inverse cascade regime to persist is that the relative helicity should be positive definite at all scales .",
    "ideal ( unforced and inviscid ) incompressible flows on a three dimensional cubic domain with periodic boundary conditions ( i.e. on the torus @xmath8 ) are governed by the euler equations for the velocity field @xmath9 : @xmath10 it is customary to introduce the fourier decomposition for the velocity field @xmath11 with @xmath12 , and @xmath13 the pontryagin dual of the torus @xmath14 .",

    "what we have just described is the dominant behavior for homogeneous isotropic flows when taking into account the whole phase space .",

    "the enstrophy @xmath68 , the helicity is not sign - definite and neither is its fourier spectrum @xmath69 .",
    "this suggests that one should consider _ scale - by - scale _ symmetry breaking rather than just global helicity .",
    "indeed , in at least two different contexts , this type of constraint resulted in the emergence of an inverse cascade : numerical simulations of the navier - stokes equations projected on the subspace of positive definite helicity at all scales @xcite and beltrami flows ( velocity - vorticity alignment ) in a von karman experiment @xcite .",
    "these situations both correspond to cases of maximal symmetry breaking .",

    "[ 3ddecspectrafig ] the typical equilibrium spectra for energy and helicity corresponding to these three cases . regime ( iii ) is a high - helicity regime with concentration of the energy at the small scales , similar to the full phase space of 3d helical turbulence ( compare to fig .",

    ", we have two ranges corresponding to energy equipartition at large scales and helicity equipartition at small scales .",
    "in addition to helicity equipartition at small scales , regime ( i ) features an energy _ condensation at large scales _ as in the 2d case .",
    "this energy condensation at statistical equilibrium for the ideal system indicates that if there is an energy inertial range in the forced dissipative system , it should correspond to an inverse cascade .",
    "indeed , in an inertial range with constant energy flux @xmath63 and zero helicity flux @xmath93 , dimensional analysis gives an energy spectrum scaling as @xmath94 ( as in 2d turbulence ) .",
    "in particular , the energy spectrum in the inertial range should be shallower than the equilibrium .",
    "hence , assuming a tendency to relax towards the equilibrium , even in the presence of forcing and dissipation , the direction of the cascade should be towards the larger scales .",
    "the existence of the energy inertial range and the energy cascade towards the large scales have been observed in both numerical simulations retaining only same helical polarization interactions @xcite , which amounts to projecting the dynamics on @xmath80 , and a von krman experiment  @xcite where the system reaches a steady state which is a beltrami flow  @xcite . in a similar manner",
    ", the equilibrium spectrum in regime ( i ) points to a tendency towards helicity equipartition at small scales , which implies a positive flux of helicity .",
    "therefore , the statistical mechanics approach seems consistent with the general idea that a positive - definite helicity plays an analogous role to enstrophy in 2d flows  @xcite , in that it prevents a simultaneous downscale cascade of energy and helicity .        to describe further the analogy",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ 2dspectrafig ] the equilibrium energy and enstrophy spectra obtained in the three regimes analogous to ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) in 2d turbulence  @xcite .",
    "the three regimes look quite similar , with a high enstrophy regime where the energy concentrates at the small scales ( iii ) , an intermediate regime ( ii ) , and a low enstrophy regime with energy condensation at the large scales ( i ) . nevertheless , there are also interesting differences .",
    "first , in the energy equipartition spectra , the enstrophy ( 2d ) and the helicity ( 3d ) spectra have the same scalings , but of course the energy spectrum does not have the same scaling in the 2d and the 3d case .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the number of modes in a spherical shell of radius @xmath2 scales as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the dimension .",
    "but this does not change the qualitative behavior ; in particular , these spectra remain increasing functions of @xmath2 .",
    "more interestingly , the helicity equipartition regime on @xmath81 and the enstrophy equipartition regime in 2d do not yield the same scalings for the energy and helicity / enstrophy spectra .",
    "in particular , the energy spectrum at enstrophy equipartition in 2d decreases as @xmath97 , while at helicity equipartition on @xmath81 , it increases as @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , the energy spectrum at helicity equipartition on @xmath81 behaves like the enstrophy spectrum at enstrophy equipartition in 2d .",
    "this indicates that in spite of the presence of an inverse cascade , substantial transfers of energy to the small scales should nevertheless be expected .",
    "this is at variance with the 2d case , for which such forward energy transfers are constrained to be very small by the fjrtoft argument @xcite ( see also refs . ) . in its _ centroid _ version , the fjrtoft argument relies on simple inequalities between the energy containing wavenumber @xmath98 and the enstrophy containing wavenumber @xmath99 .",
    "the cauchy - schwarz inequality implies that @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , the energy containing wavenumber is bounded from above , the enstrophy containing wavenumber is bounded from below , and their product is bounded from below .",
    "hence , a decrease of @xmath102 ( i.e. inverse cascade of energy ) must be accompanied by an increase of @xmath103 ( i.e. direct cascade of enstrophy ) . introducing the @xmath104-centroids @xmath105 and deriving the analogous inequalities @xmath106 and",
    "@xmath107 , we obtain the converse of this statement : the direct cascade of enstrophy implies an inverse cascade of energy .    here , the relation between the two invariants does not yield such a strong constraint ; with the same definition for the energy containing scale @xmath102 , we see that @xmath108 is constant in time .",
    "similarly , introducing the characteristic wave numbers and length scales @xmath109 and @xmath110 , we see that @xmath111 is also constant , and that @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the inequalities indicate that there is a lower bound to the helicity containing wave number and to the energy containing scales , analogously to 2d turbulence .",
    "but the fact that @xmath102 is constant in time points out that an increase of @xmath114 for @xmath2 smaller than @xmath102 ( i.e. at large scales ) must be compensated by an increase for @xmath2 larger than @xmath102 ( i.e. at small scales ) , so that the mean value of the distribution remains constant in time .",
    "a similar reasoning holds with @xmath69 , as @xmath110 is also time independent .",
    "it remains unclear if and how this property of the ideal system will impact the forced - dissipative case .",
    "it may indicate that in addition to the energy inverse cascade , substantial forward energy transfers may remain , although it seems unlikely that they should organize into an inertial range with a constant flux .",
    "note that the possibility of a _ dual cascade _ phenomenology ( coexisting inverse and direct cascades for the same quantity ) has been suggested in rotating  @xcite and rotating - stratified turbulence  @xcite , but in the case of helically decimated flows , the possibility of a range of constant positive energy fluxes has been ruled out by biferale et al .",
    "@xcite .      in the previous paragraph",
    ", we have shown that an inverse cascade of energy could be obtained as a subdominant contribution to the partition function stemming from the part of phase space corresponding to maximal parity symmetry breaking : on @xmath80 , the absolute value of the relative helicity @xmath115 is equal to its maximum value of 1 at all scales . a legitimate question to ask",
    "is : how much symmetry breaking do we need to obtain this phenomenon ? let us consider a different family of restricted phase spaces : @xmath116 these flows have a relative helicity @xmath117 , which goes to zero uniformly as @xmath118 does .",

    "therefore , the results of this statistical mechanics approach restricted to submanifolds of phase space tends to confirm the idea that when helicity becomes sign - definite at all scales , it plays an analogous role to enstrophy in 2d and forbids the simultaneous existence of a forward cascade of energy and helicity , as anticipated by kraichnan  @xcite and further developed by biferale et al .",
    "we have further discussed this analogy with 2d turbulence by examining the differences between the two systems , in the helicity / enstrophy equipartition spectra on the one hand , and in the constraints enforced by the two invariants through the fjrtoft argument on the other hand .",
