    "we introduce a light front formalism for infinite nuclear matter , in which the effects of correlations are taken into account .",
    "this is a light front brueckner theory of nuclear matter . while the ultimate goal of this and related studies is to provide a fully relativistic treatment of nuclei which includes all previous knowledge about nuclear dynamics",
    ", the present work represents one step beyond the previous light - front mean - field calculation @xcite of the properties of infinite nuclear matter .    understanding an important class of experiments seems to require that light - front dynamics and the related light cone variables be used .",
    "consider the lepton - nucleus deep inelastic scattering experiments @xcite which showed that there is a significant difference between the parton distributions of free nucleons and nucleons in a nucleus .",
    "this difference can interpreted as a small ( @xmath0 10% ) shift in the momentum distribution of valence quarks towards smaller values of the bjorken variable @xmath1 .",
    "the bjorken variable is a ratio of the plus - momentum @xmath2 of a quark to that of the target . if one regards the nucleus as a collection of nucleons , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the plus momentum of a nucleon bound in the nucleus .",
    "if one uses @xmath5 as a momentum variable the corresponding canonical spatial variable is @xmath6 and the time variable is @xmath7@xcite .",
    "this is the light front ( lf ) approach of dirac@xcite ; see the recent reviews@xcite for more information .",
    "deep inelastic scattering depends on the light - front momentum distribution which is the probability @xmath8 that a bound nucleon has a momentum @xmath4 .",
    "other nuclear reactions , such as ( e , e ) and ( p,2p ) depend also on this very same probability@xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 is simply related to the square of the ground state wave function , computed using light front dynamics . the usual equal time approach to nuclear dynamics is very successful , and it is natural to use this information to calculate the distribution @xmath8 .",
    "however , in the standard equal time formulation this quantity is a response function and depends on matrix elements between the ground and all excited states , and therefore can be more difficult to compute .",
    "the use of light front variables is convenient for interpreting certain experiments , but does not allow one to avoid the necessary task of handling nuclear dynamics .",
    "thus one is faced with the task of computing the ground state nuclear wave function using @xmath9 as a time variable .",
    "the present effort is a simplification in that the nucleus is taken to be infinite nuclear matter .",
    "however , the detailed effects of the interactions between two nucleons are included , so that we are concerned with the relativistic dynamics of a strongly interacting many body system .",
    "light front techniques have previously been applied to systems of two hadrons @xcite .",
    "our emphasis here is in large nuclear systems .",
    "the light front quantization procedure necessary to treat nucleon interactions with scalar and vector mesons was derived by soper@xcite , and by yan and collaborators@xcite .",

    "the necessary lagrangian , which respects chiral symmetry , and its light front hamiltonian is described in sect .",
    "its application to nucleon - nucleon scattering in the one - boson exchange approximation is carried out in sect .",
    "a new feature is that the effects of isovector mesons such as the @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and the @xmath10-nucleon tensor interaction are included .",
    "the nn potential is generated using the one - boson exchange approximation .",
    "the weinberg - type integral equation , which maintains unitarity and boost invariance in one direction , is solved and the results are compared with phase shift data .",
    "iv is concerned with the many - nucleon problem .",
    "two separate perturbation series are involved .",
    "the first step is to eliminate temporarily the meson degrees of freedom in favor of our two nucleon potential .",
    "thus one first proceeds using only nucleon degrees of freedom .",
    "the light - front formalism to obtain the nucleonic interacting ground state wave function @xmath12 in terms of a series in which a brueckner g matrix acts on a best slater determinant @xmath13 is developed .",
    "the independent - pair approximation is used .",
    "one must find an eigenstate of the @xmath14 operator for which the expectation value of @xmath15 is equal to the eigenvalue of @xmath14 .",
    "this formalism is applied and the results are discussed in sect .",
    "v. the full nuclear wave function @xmath16 , including the meson degrees of freedom , is discussed in sect .",
    "the object @xmath16 is related to @xmath12 by a second series involving the difference between the nucleon - nucleon interaction and the meson nucleon interactions .",
    "one finds that the expression for the nuclear mass , evaluated in sect .",
    "v , is valid within our approximation .",
    "furthermore , expressions for the meson and nucleon distribution functions are obtained .",
    "we derive a sum rule for obtaining the total number of ( non - vector ) mesons in the nucleus .",
    "a brief discussion of the implications of our results for lepton - nucleus deep inelastic scattering and the nuclear drell - yan process is presented in sect .",
    "a brief summary of our results is contained in set .",
    "some of the necessary notation is discussed in an appendix",
    ". some of the present results , but none of the details of the derivation or of our two - nucleon potential have appeared in ref.@xcite .",
    "the light front approach is a three - dimensional formalism involving a hamiltonian which is a @xmath14 operator .",
    "one starts with a lagrangian and derives field equations which allow one to eliminate the appearance of dependent degrees of freedom in the hamiltonian .",
    "our starting point is a non - linear chiral model in which the nuclear constituents are nucleons @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 , pions @xmath19 , scalar mesons @xmath20@xcite , and vector mesons @xmath21 .",

    "this is not really a problem because loop effects can make up the needed 25% effect .",
    "corrections of that size are typical of order @xmath37 effects found in the cloudy bag model@xcite for many observables , including @xmath38 .",
    "we also note that the @xmath39 is not treated as an explicit degree of freedom in the above lagrangian",
    ".    the present lagrangian may be thought of as a low energy effective theory for nuclei under normal conditions .",
    "a more sophisticated lagrangian is reviewed in @xcite and used in @xcite ; the present one is used to show that light front techniques can be applied to hadronic theories relevant for nuclear physics .",
    "this hadronic model , when evaluated in mean field approximation , gives@xcite at least a qualitatively good description of many ( but not all ) nuclear properties and reactions .",
    "there are a variety of problems occurring when higher order terms are included@xcite .",
    "the aim here is to use a reasonably sophisticated lagrangian to study the effects that one might obtain by using a light front formulation .    ref .",
    "@xcite contains the details of the quantization procedure ; we re - state the relevant results here .",
    "an essential feature is the quantization of spin 1/2 fermions .",
    "although described by four - component spinors , these fields have only two independent degrees of freedom .",
    "the light front formalism allows a convenient separation of dependent and independent variables via the projection operators @xmath40@xcite , with @xmath41 .",
    "the independent fermion degree of freedom is chosen to be @xmath42 .",
    "the properties of the projection operators are discussed in appendix a. one gets coupled equations for @xmath43 : @xmath44 the relation between @xmath45 and @xmath42 is very complicated unless one may set the plus component of the vector field to zero@xcite .",
    "this is immediately obtained in qed and qcd by choosing an appropriate gauge in which the plus - component of the vector potential vanishes . here",
    "the non - zero mass of the vector meson prevents such a choice .",
    "instead , one simplifies the equation for @xmath45 by@xcite transforming the fermion field according to @xmath46 with @xmath47 this transformation leads to the result@xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 the fields @xmath21 enter the meson field equations , but the fields @xmath50 enter the fermion field equations . the eigenmode expansion for @xmath51 is given by : @xmath52,\\label{nvfield}\\ ] ] where the polarization vectors @xmath53 are given by@xcite : @xmath54 with the properties @xmath55    the use of the fermion field equation allows one to obtain the light front hamiltonian density @xmath56    the expression ( [ tpm1 ] ) is useful for situations , such as in the mean field approximation , for which a simple expression for @xmath57 is known .",

    "previous work @xcite showed that the light - front version of the lippmann - schwinger equation , the weinberg equation , can be transformed ( with one difference remaining@xcite ) into the blankenbecler - sugar equation .",

    "such diagrams might not generate the phenomenologically required values of the coupling constants , but all that is needed here is that terms of the correct form be produced .",
    "this is because the standard procedure is to choose the values of the coupling constants so as to yield a good description of the nn scattering data .",

    "this is also the procedure of refs .",
    "@xcite . in principle , calculating the higher order terms using the correct lagrangian can lead to consistent calculations of these form factors .",
    "we use a more phenomenological approach here .",
    "the net result is that the one - boson exchange treatment of the nucleon - nucleon potential and the t - matrix resulting from its use in the bbs equation is essentially the same as the one - boson exchange procedure of refs .",

    "<S> a relativistic light front formulation of nuclear dynamics is developed and applied to treating infinite nuclear matter in a method which includes the correlations of pairs of nucleons : this is light front brueckner theory . </S>",
    "<S> we start with a hadronic meson - baryon lagrangian that is consistent with chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this is used to obtain a light front version of a one - boson - exchange nucleon - nucleon potential ( obep ) . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of our description of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) data is good , and similar to that of other relativistic obep models . </S>",
    "<S> we derive , within the light front formalism , the hartree - fock and brueckner hartree - fock equations . applying our light front obep , </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear matter saturation properties are reasonably well reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a value of the compressibility , 180 mev , that is smaller than that of alternative relativistic approaches to nuclear matter in which the compressibility usually comes out too large . because the derivation starts from a meson - baryon lagrangian , we are able to show that replacing the meson degrees of freedom by a nn interaction is a consistent approximation , and the formalism allows one to calculate corrections to this approximation in a well - organized manner . </S>",
    "<S> the simplicity of the vacuum in our light front approach is an important feature in allowing the derivations to proceed . </S>",
    "<S> the mesonic fock space components of the nuclear wave function are obtained also , and aspects of the meson and nucleon plus - momentum distribution functions are computed . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there are about 0.05 excess pions per nucleon . </S>"
