    "realistic nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions like the phenomenological reid soft - core potential@xcite or one - boson - exchange ( obe ) potentials@xcite , which are adjusted to fit the nn scattering data , typically contain rather strong short - range components .",
    "these short - range parts as well as a non - negligible tensor component are responsible for the fact that simple mean - field or hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations of nuclear systems yield very unsatisfactory results .",
    "it turns out that hf calculations using such realistic nn forces may not even lead to bound nuclei@xcite .",
    "therefore , based on these theoretical considerations it seems obvious that nuclear wave - functions must contain correlations , which are induced by these short - range and tensor components and can not be accounted for in the mean - field or hf approximation to the solution of the many - body problem .    the question is , whether there exist experimental observables which reflect these correlations in an unambiguous way . in particular it would be nice if one could explore these correlations in terms of single - nucleon observables since they are easier to measure as well as to calculate .",
    "this leads to the question how correlations affect the single - particle density @xmath1 in the nuclear many - body system . rather than discussing this non - local representation of the density matrix",
    ", we may consider as well its wigner transform@xcite @xmath2 . integrating this wigner distribution over all momenta @xmath3 yields the local density @xmath4 .",
    "this local density distribution , or to be more precise the corresponding charge distribution has been investigated with high precision in elastic electron scattering experiments@xcite .",
    "also the matter distribution can be analyzed in a rather model - independent way by means of elastic @xmath5 scattering and other probes@xcite .",
    "it seems , however , that these `` experimental '' charge and matter distributions can very well be reproduced within a mean - field approximation for the nuclear wave - function .",
    "integrating the wigner transform of the one - nucleon density matrix over all spatial coordinates one obtains the momentum distribution @xmath6 . for an infinite system , invariant under local transformations , the mean - field or hartree - fock prediction for this momentum distribution is identical to the momentum distribution of a free fermi gas",
    "this means that all states with momenta less than the fermi momentum @xmath7 are occupied with a probability @xmath8 , while all states with momenta @xmath3 above @xmath7 are completely unoccupied ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "correlations beyond the hf approach modify this momentum distribution in the sense that states with momenta below @xmath7 are partly depleted , whereas states with high momenta are partly occupied .    from these considerations for the infinite system of nuclear matter",
    "one may expect that correlations beyond hf will enhance the momentum distribution at high momenta @xmath3 also for finite nuclei .",
    "this is one reason why modern electron accelerators have been used to explore the momentum distribution of nucleons in nuclei by means of nucleon knock - out , @xmath10 , experiments@xcite .",
    "microscopic nuclear structure calculations which account for the effects of short - range and tensor correlations of realistic nn interactions are mainly performed for very light nuclei@xcite or infinite nuclear matter@xcite . from these results for nuclear matter",
    "one then tries to extract the effects of nn correlations in order to estimate their influence on the momentum distribution of real nuclei using a local density approximation ( lda)@xcite .",
    "recently , there have also been attempts to determine the momentum distribution in a microscopic calculation considering directly finite nuclei as @xmath0@xcite .",
    "it turns out that the green s function approach is particularly useful for these investigations .",
    "this method not only provides the total momentum distribution but also yields detailed information on the spectral function .",
    "this spectral function contains the information at which excitation of the residual nucleus or , using the nomenclature of the knock - out experiment , at which missing energy the various components of the momentum distribution should be observed .",
    "these studies predict that high - momentum components in the momentum distribution due to short - range correlations should show up preferentially at large missing energies .",
    "the comparison of the momentum distributions obtained within the green s function approach for @xmath0 with corresponding ones for nuclear matter exhibited remarkable discrepancies@xcite . therefore the question arises if these discrepancies demonstrate the limitation of the lda in predicting the momentum distribution .",
    "as it has been argued already in @xcite , such a conclusion would be premature since that comparison was plagued with various inconsistencies like e.g.    * the momentum distribution calculated for nuclear matter using the green s function approach has been available only for one specific density , the saturation density of nuclear matter .",
    "this density may be too large to be typical for the situation of nuclei as small as @xmath0 . *",
    "the result for nuclear matter has been derived from a self - consistent calculation of the single - particle green s function@xcite whereas the calculation for the finite system has been performed considering contributions to the self - energy of the nucleons up to second order in a nuclear matter g - matrix@xcite * the calculation of the self - energy for the nucleons in the finite system has been made employing a single - particle spectrum with a substantial gap at the fermi surface , whereas a continuous prescription has been used for nuclear matter . * the calculation for the finite system",
    "was limited to partial waves with angular momenta @xmath11 .",
    "this limitation may be too severe for the momentum distribution at high momenta .",
    "* while the reid soft - core potential@xcite has been used for the study of nuclear matter in @xcite the obe potential @xmath12 of @xcite has been employed for the calculation of @xmath0 .",
    "it is one aim of the present investigation to remove some of the differences between these calculations of finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter .",
    "furthermore we want to study the sensitivity of the calculated momentum distributions in the nuclear systems on the nuclear density , the nn interaction considered and various other ingredients of the many - body calculation . for that purpose",
    "we have developed a new very efficient method to calculate the momentum distribution in nuclear matter using an approximation to the green s function method very similar to the one presented in @xcite for finite nuclei .",
    "the comparison of results obtained with this approximation scheme with those resulting from the much more sophisticated scheme of @xcite demonstrates the reliability of the method developed here .",
    "the efficiency of the new scheme allows the detailed studies mentioned above .    after this introduction section 2 of this paper describes the technique to be used for studies of nuclear matter .",
    "in particular we will also present an efficient representation of the single - particle green s function , which allows a self - consistent treatment . in section 3 we briefly review the basic approximations used in the calculation of the momentum distribution for finite nuclei of @xcite and we outline a method to determine this momentum distribution , in which the mean field part is calculated for the finite system but the effects of correlations are taken from nuclear matter at various densities , using a lda .",
    "the results of the numerical calculations are presented in section 4 . in this chapter",
    "we discuss the sensitivity of the results in nuclear matter on the various ingredients .",

    "the hf approximation in terms of a realistic nn interaction is not a very useful approach and it is not clear whether a perturbation expansion in terms of the bare nn interaction up to second order , as just outlined , will be sufficient .",

    "the remaining contributions to the sum in eq.([eq : momen2 ] ) will be called the continuum contribution to the occupation probability or momentum distribution .    from the inspection of the results displayed in fig.[fig : nm3 ] one finds that the quasihole contribution to the occupation probability increases drastically with the momentum while the continuum contribution decreases in a corresponding way . a typical ratio of quasihole versus continuum contribution is 0.6 for small momenta but as large as 10 for momenta close to the fermi momentum .",
    "this means that the energy distribution of the single - particle strength is highly localized at the quasihole energy for states with momenta close to @xmath7 whereas one observes a brought distribution and fragmentation of the strength for small momenta , i.e.  deeply bound hole states .",
    "the continuum contribution to the occupation probability decreases monotonically with increasing momentum and is a rather smooth function even at the fermi momentum .",
    "this implies that the gap in the momentum distribution exhibited e.g. in fig.[fig : nm1 ] at @xmath131 originates simply from the fact that the quasihole contribution vanishes since the energy of the corresponding state gets larger than the fermi energy .",
    "it is worth noting that about 70 percent of the single - particle strength is located in the quasihole contribution .",
    "two thirds of the remaining continuum contribution occurs at momenta below the fermi momentum and only one third of the continuum contribution , which means slightly more than 10 percent of the total strength occurs at momenta above @xmath7 .    from the single - particle green s function",
    "we also determine the mean value of the energy for the spectral distribution at a given momentum @xmath132 or translated into the tools we are using in our numerical treatment @xmath133 with the occupation number @xmath134 calculated following eq([eq : momen2 ] ) .",
    "the summation in this equation can be truncated as discussed above to determine the mean value for the energy resulting from the continuum part of the momentum distribution .",
    "such mean values are presented in the right part of fig.[fig : nm4 ] .",
    "one finds that these mean values for the continuum are more negative than the corresponding hf single - particle energies or the energies of the quasihole states , which are shown in the left part of fig.[fig : nm4 ] ( note the different scales on the axes ) . particularly at large momenta , above @xmath7 where the continuum part represents the total momentum distribution , these mean values @xmath135 are very attractive .",
    "this implies that these high momentum components of the momentum distribution occur predominantly at large excitation energies of the residual nuclear system , which corresponds to large missing energies in knock out experiments .",
    "this result for nuclear matter confirms the observations made for finite systems in @xcite .    in the left part of fig.[fig : nm4 ] the bhf single - particle energies ( lines labeled with triangles ) are compared to the energies @xmath128 of the quasihole energies .",
    "one can see that the inclusion of the 2h1p terms of fig.[fig : diag]c yields a repulsive contribution to the quasihole energy .",
    "this is specially true for states with momenta well below the fermi momentum .",
    "this means that the removal energy for nucleon knock out experiments exciting states with large spectroscopic factor should be much smaller for these deeply bound states than predicted in bhf calculations .",
    "as a last point in this subsection we would like to explore the sensitivity of the calculated momentum distribution on the hf single - particle spectrum .",
    "for that purpose we have modified the effective mass parameter @xmath119 in the parameterization of eq.([eq : paraeps ] ) from the bhf value of @xmath119=623 mev @xcite at @xmath7 = 1.35 @xmath122 by @xmath136 100 mev . from the upper part of fig.[fig : nm5 ] one can see that a reduction of the effective mass , i.e.  the single - particle energy shows a stronger momentum dependence , yields a reduction of the correlation effect .",
    "this reduction of the correlations is indicated by an enhancement of the occupation of states with @xmath137 and a reduction of the high momentum components .",
    "another modification of the hf single - particle spectrum can be obtained by introducing a gap between the energies of particle and hole states .",
    "as on can observe from the lower part of fig.[fig : nm5 ] such a gap does not affect the high momentum components very much but only the occupation probability around @xmath7 .      in order to investigate the efficiency of the bagel approximation introduced in the previous section for the representation of the single - particle green s function in terms of a few poles",
    "we have evaluated the momentum distribution of nuclear matter considering various combinations bagel(n , m ) for the number of basis states @xmath60 in the 2p1h and @xmath26 in the 2h1p part of the eigenvalue problem eq.([eq : matr1 ] ) . results for a few examples are displayed in fig.[fig : nm6 ] .",
    "one finds that a very good approximation for the high - momentum components is obtained already with a very small number of basis states .",
    "the occupation probabilities for @xmath138 are reproduced in quite a satisfactory way in the simplest approximation bagel(1,1 ) and the results become indistinguishable from the exact results if we use any approximation with @xmath139 larger than 1 .",
    "the convergence of the bagel approximation towards the exact result with increasing @xmath139 is not as good for the occupation of states below @xmath7",
    ". a larger number of pole terms is required in particular to reproduce the decrease of the occupation number with @xmath3 getting close to @xmath7 .",
    "of course it is still a very efficient approximation to reduce the number of poles in the lehmann representation of the single - particle green s function of eq.([eq : lehman ] ) from a few hundred obtained by an optimized discretization of the integrals in eqs.([eq : self2p1h ] ) and ( [ eq : self2h1p ] ) to @xmath140 = 21 in the bagel(15,5 ) approximation , but a closer inspection may help us to reduce the number of terms even more .    analyzing the basis states which are generated by the bagel approach in the 2p1h part of the hilbert space by applying @xmath52 of eq.([eq : bag1 ] ) according to the lanczos scheme",
    ", one observes that states are generated with very large eigenvalue @xmath41 but negligible amplitude @xmath68 .",
    "it requires some iteration steps to generate a few states with lower energy and non - negligible coefficient .",
    "this generation of basis states with extreme energies is of course a feature of the lanczos approach , which is not optimal for our present purpose .",
    "the situation is better for the generation of basis states in the 2h1p sector , as the eigenvalues of @xmath141 ( see eq.[eq : bag1 ] ) ) are more limited .    from this discussion",
    "we see that the bagel approximation for the green s function can be made more efficient by either ignoring the contributions of those poles in the lehmann representation of eq.([eq : lehman ] ) , which show very small coefficients @xmath68 or to replace the lanczos algorithm of generating the basis states by one , which preferably generates eigenstates close to the fermi energy .      as a first example for the momentum distribution calculated directly for the finite nucleus @xmath0 using the method described in @xcite and briefly reviewed in section [ sec3.1 ] , we present in fig.[fig : o1 ] as a typical example the momentum distribution obtained for @xmath93 partial wave .",
    "this refers to the corresponding contribution to the sum in eq.([eq : momfin ] ) without the factor @xmath142 for degeneracy of these states . as in @xcite",
    "we split the momentum distribution into a quasihole contribution , which should be observed if the @xmath143 nucleus remains in its groundstate , and a continuum part reflecting the momentum distribution observed at larger missing energies .",
    "the results obtained for the reid soft - core potential@xcite ( dashed lines ) are rather similar to those evaluated for the obe potential @xmath12 of @xcite ( solid lines ) . however , there are some characteristic differences which can also be observed in the other partial waves : the quasihole contribution evaluated for the reid potential exhibits a maximum at smaller momenta and drops faster with increasing momentum .",
    "this reflects the fact that nuclear structure calculations like bhf yield less binding energy and a larger radius using the reid soft - core potential as compared to the obe model for the nn interaction .",
    "the continuum part , on the other side , exhibits larger contributions at high momenta using the reid potential .",
    "following the arguments present in the introduction of this paper , this would be an indication that the reid potential predicts `` stronger '' correlations .",
    "another indicator for the importance of nn correlations are the occupation probabilities for the various partial waves as they are listed in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "these occupation probabilities are obtained by a momentum integration of the various partial wave contributions in eq.([eq : momfin ] ) .",
    "again we distinguish between quasihole and continuum contribution for the partial waves with @xmath144 and compare the results for the two models of the nn interaction .",
    "the results presented here for the obe potential deviate slightly from those presented in @xcite as we have increased the interval for the energy integration in eq.([eq : momfin ] ) in our present study .",
    "it is interesting to note that the occupation probabilities are quite similar for both interactions for the orbits with angular momentum @xmath145 with slightly larger values for the obe potential . for the partial waves with larger @xmath146",
    ", however , the reid potential predicts occupation probabilities which are significantly larger than those for the obe potential .",
    "this difference seems to be due to the stronger tensor component contained in the reid potential .",
    "multiplying the occupation probabilities of table [ tab : tab1 ] with the degeneracy factors @xmath142 one finds that 2.05 ( 2.09 , using reid ) `` nucleons '' out of the 16 for @xmath0 are represented by the continuum part of the momentum distribution .",
    "the total nucleon numbers , including the quasihole part are 16.07 and 15.96 for the obe and reid potential , respectively .",
    "this means that the particle - number violating features of our present approach lacking a self - consistent treatment of the single - particle green s function are not very strong @xcite .",
    "the continuum part of the total momentum distribution including partial waves with @xmath147 in the summation of eq.([eq : momfin ] ) is displayed in the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig : o2 ] .",
    "again we can observe the characteristic differences obtained for the two interactions : while the obe potential yields a momentum distribution which is slightly larger at small momenta , the reid potential predicts contributions which are larger by almost a factor of 2 at large momenta .",
    "this is in complete agreement with the observation made above for nuclear matter ( see fig.[fig : nm1 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : o2 ] also exhibits the spectral distribution of the continuum part .",
    "this spectral distribution is obtained by replacing the energy integration in eq.([eq : momfin ] ) by a momentum integration .",
    "one observes that the spectral distribution derived for the obe potential is slightly larger at energies with small absolute value , which corresponds to small missing energies , while the reid potential yields a larger result at large missing energies .",
    "concluding we may characterize the differences between the two interactions by the statement : the reid potential predicts a larger component of the single - particle density at large momenta and large missing energies as compared to obep @xmath12 .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss the validity of the local density approximation ( lda ) introduced in section [ sec3.2 ] for the description of the momentum distribution at large momenta .",
    "since this high - momentum part of the momentum distribution is dominated by the continuum contribution @xmath113 in eq.([eq : momen4 ] ) we will restrict our discussion to this part and its comparison to the continuum part of the momentum distribution evaluated directly for finite nuclei .    the result for @xmath113 calculated according to eq.([eq : deltan ] ) using the obe interaction is represented by the solid line in the left part of fig.[fig : o3 ] . in the discussion of the lda above",
    "we already introduced a scheme to simulate the effects of a cutoff in the partial wave summation for the evaluation of the momentum distribution in finite nuclei . comparing the prediction for the total @xmath113 with those employing a restriction to a maximal orbital angular momentum",
    ", one observes that such a restriction leads to remarkable differences in particular at high momenta .",
    "using @xmath148 in eq.([eq : lmax ] ) one obtains a prediction for the momentum distribution , which is only one half of the result including all partial waves at @xmath123 3.5 @xmath122 .",
    "the right part of fig.[fig : o3 ] shows the comparison of the continuum part of the momentum distribution evaluated directly for @xmath0 with the lda prediction using @xmath149 , the maximal orbital angular momentum , which we have taken into account in our direct evaluation for the finite system .",
    "the agreement of the lda with the direct evaluation is very good in particular at high momenta . for small momenta the direct calculation for the finite system yields a larger value than the lda . for these small momenta ,",
    "however , one must keep in mind that the continuum part calculated directly for the finite system contains components , which have a momentum distribution similar to the quasihole part@xcite , whereas the @xmath113 evaluated in lda only accounts for momenta above the local fermi momenta @xmath150 .    concluding",
    "we may say that the discrepancy observed in ref.@xcite between the predictions of high momentum components in the single - particle density of nuclear matter and those for finite systems has been resolved .",
    "the lda seems to produce very similar results if the same nn interaction is used , an appropriate average over nuclear matter with various densities is considered and the effects of truncating the partial wave expansion in finite systems are taken into account .",
    "the single - particle momentum distribution has been investigated for nuclear matter and the finite nucleus employing two different realistic models for the nn interaction .",
    "the investigations are based on the green s function approach approximating the self - energy of the nucleon including all contributions up to second order in the @xmath66-matrix .",
    "the main results can be summarized by the following conclusions .    *",
    "the present approach yields results for nuclear matter which are in very good agreement with the more elaborate calculations of @xcite .",
    "this gives us some confidence that the same approximation should also produce reliable results if applied for finite systems .",
    "* the momentum distribution observed in knock - out experiments with small missing energies should mainly observe the quasihole distribution with small components at high momenta .",
    "larger contributions to the single - particle density at high momenta should be obtained at large excitation energies of the residual nucleus . *",
    "the prediction for the momentum distribution depend weakly but in a rather characteristic way on the interaction used .",
    "the stronger tensor and short - range components of the reid soft - core potential yields a larger single - particle strength at high momenta and large missing energies as compared to the obe potential @xmath12 of @xcite .",
    "for momenta around 3.5 @xmath122 the momentum distribution derived from the reid interaction is larger by a factor 2 in nuclear matter as well as finite nuclei .",
    "* the momentum distribution calculated for finite nuclei is rather sensitive to a truncation in a partial wave expansion .",
    "orbits with angular momenta @xmath146 larger than 4 should be taken into account to obtain stable results at momenta @xmath151 4 @xmath122 . * a local density approximation , in which the high momentum components in the single - particle density are derived from the study of correlations in nuclear matter , yields a very good agreement with corresponding studies for finite nuclei , if the effects due to truncations in the partial wave expansion are considered .",
    "* the numerical scheme developed for the solution of the dyson equation in nuclear matter leads to a very efficient representation of the single - particle green s function in terms of a few `` characteristic '' poles in the lehmann representation .",
    "this bagel approximation could be very useful e.g. in studies of nuclear response functions beyond the hf and rpa approximations .",
