    "+ * what are the properties of neutrinos ?",
    "+ * do all forces , including gravity , unify ? + * what is the nature of dark matter , dark energy ?",

    "in fact the data from wmap and astrophysics / cosmology @xcite can already put constraints on many possible supersymmetric models . for example , within the constrained mssm ( cmssm - often referred to as msugra ) with universal scalar ( @xmath1 ) and gaugino ( @xmath2 ) masses and universal trilinear ( @xmath3 ) scalar couplings at some unification scale , the dark matter data ( and low - energy and collider constraints ) select a thin strip in the @xmath1-@xmath2 parameter plane , shown in fig.[fig : cmssm](a ) , in which @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "a scan of the cmssm parameter space gives a broader band , as shown in the plane of the lightest visible ( lvsp ) and the next - to - lightest visible ( nlvsp ) superparticle masses , see fig.[fig : cmssm](b ) ; the lsp itself was considered not to be visible @xcite .",
    "this figure gives an impression that most of the points ( in this specific model ) are outside the reach of the ilc .",
    "however , at the ilc in most cases the lightest neutralino @xmath0 will clearly be detected and its mass measured .",
    "therefore a better representation of the reach of the ilc is shown in fig.[fig : cmssm](c ) in which a large fraction of the allowed combinations of parameters scanned for the previous plot would give signals accessible to ilc , at least through @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the isolated spot at low neutralino masses is from the focus point region of parameter space ( also omitted in @xcite ) .    from this discussion",
    "it follows that susy can naturally be compatible with present electroweak ( ew ) measurements .",
    "in fact , the fit to ew and dm data , again within the cmssm , points to rather low values of susy breaking parameters , as seen in fig.[fig : cmssm](d ) @xcite , which interestingly enough are close to the benchmark point sps1a of @xcite .",

    "many channels from squark and/or gluino decays may be observed and measured .",
    "if the decay chain is long enough , like the first squark decay chain shown in fig.[fig : chain](a ) , from a knowledge of kinematical endpoints , in particular those of the invariant mass distributions @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , the masses of the unstable particles can be reconstructed @xcite .",
    "indeed , the endpoints of these distributions can be expressed explicitly in terms of @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "however , ambiguities in the masses extracted from endpoint measurements can occur ( even when experimental uncertainties are neglected ) since the kinematical endpoints are composite functions of the unknown masses .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : chain](b ) where the false minimum around 80 gev is found @xcite .",
    "moreover , the same visible final state @xmath81 can be generated by a different susy decay chain ( second decay chain in fig.[fig : chain](a ) ) , or a kaluza - klein decay chain in a non - supersymmetric model with universal extra dimensions @xcite ( last decay chain in fig .",
    "[ fig : chain](c ) )",
    ". therefore , the correlation of measured masses with particles may not be unique .",
    "what differs the decay chains is the spin of intermediate particles .",
    "although the lhc might have some sensitivity to spin @xcite , both problems  spin and mass ambiguities  can be disentangled with the help of the ilc by verifying masses and measuring spins of new particles @xcite .",
    "in addition , the precise measurements of kinematically accessible sparticles at the ilc can facilitate the correct interpretation of the kinematical endpoints , like the largest observed edge in the opposite - sign same - flavor ( op - sf ) dilepton invariant mass spectrum @xmath76 shown in fig.[fig : chain](c ) as originating from heavy neutralino in the mssm context @xcite .",

    "can provide interesting constraints on virtual sleptons mediating the chargino decay @xcite .",
    "preliminary studies of msugra points presented at this meeting show that at the lhc the use of a sophisticated kolmogorov - smirnov test for the dilepton mass spectra from the neutralino decay can at least distinguish the high - mass from low - mass scenarios and a lower limit on the universal scalar mass parameter @xmath1 can be determined @xcite    many interesting channels can be exploited to extract the basic supersymmetry parameters when combining experimental information from sharp edges in mass distributions at lhc with measurements of decay spectra and threshold excitation curves at an @xmath19 collider with energy up to 1 tev . from the simulated experimental data with their errors available global analysis programs",
    "@xcite can exploit coherently masses , cross sections , branching ratios etc , to extract the lagrangian parameters .",

    "much progress has been achieved during the last year since lscw04 . on the theory side",
    "many higher - order calculations have been completed and implemented in numerical codes .",
    "the spa convention and project has been launched which should prove very useful in streamlining discussions and comparisons of different calculations and experimental analyses . on the experimental side",
    "many analyses are still based on lowest  order expressions . in our future studies",
    "it is important to ensure that new information from ilc should both significantly improve accuracies of susy studies at the lhc , as well as permit calculation of dark matter density to check cosmology / astrophysics measurements .",
    "case studies have shown that a high luminosity ilc with polarised beams , and with additional @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 modes , can provide high quality data for the precise determination of low - energy susy lagrangian parameters and with lhc data in the bottom  up approach , through the evolution of the parameters from the electroweak scale , can reveal the regularities at high scales .",
