    "out of the numerous methods available for assessing ages of stellar populations only a few will be practically applicable for use with gaia , because of obvious limitations related to the detection limits of gaia etc .",
    "( e.g. , cacciari 2002 ) .",
    "though the main sequence turn - off ( msto ) point approach is perhaps the most reliable and accurate of all dating methods available today , it will be severely distance - limited when used with gaia .    the extent of these limitations is illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "the left panel shows the maximum age obtainable with gaia employing msto fitting for stellar population placed at a distance of 8 kpc ( assuming that the msto point is located at @xmath11 , while the detection limit of gaia is @xmath12 ) .",
    "the right panel shows the maximum distance at which ages up to 15 gyr may be quantified ( in both cases , the msto point on the isochrones of girardi et al.(2000 ) was dated ) .",
    "it is obvious that in cases of negligible interstellar extinction the msto approach may work very efficiently with gaia , providing reliable ages of stellar populations up to @xmath13 kpc .",
    "however , even mild interstellar extinction changes the situation dramatically , shifting the msto point below the detection limits of gaia for many stellar populations within the galaxy .",
    "a possible way to complement the msto approach would be with tracers that are intrinsically brighter than msto stars , which could thus be used for probing stellar populations on larger distance scales .",
    "we have shown , that stars on early - agb ( non - thermally pulsing ) may be well suited for this purpose , providing reliable ages of stellar populations from the isochrone fitting to agb sequences on the observed hr diagrams ( kuinskas et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "though similar approaches have been used in the past ( e.g. , employing agb sequences in color - magnitude diagrams ) , the precision in derived ages was low .",
    "we propose to work in the @xmath14 vs.  @xmath15 plane , using effective temperatures of individual agb stars derived from the fits of the observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with synthetic seds .",
    "this yields a significant increase in precision of derived population ages , which is a result of the precisely derived @xmath15 of individual agb stars .",
    "since distances will be known for the majority of galactic agb stars with gaia ( which , combined with data from ground- and/or space - based infrared surveys , will give precise @xmath14 ) , agb stars will allow stellar populations on large distance scales to be traced with gaia .    ccccccc + cluster & [ fe / h ] & & msto ages & ref + & & b94 & g00 & ls01 & & + ngc 1783 & @xmath16 & @xmath17 & @xmath18 &  & @xmath19 & m89 + ngc 2121 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 & @xmath22 &  & @xmath23 & r01 + kron 3 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 & @xmath26 & @xmath27 & @xmath28 & r00 + & @xmath29 & @xmath30 & @xmath26 &  & @xmath31 & m98 +    we illustrate the proposed approach employing the star clusters ngc 1783 , ngc 2121 and kron 3 in the magellanic clouds .",
    "the observed seds of agb stars were constructed using _ bvrijhk _ fluxes obtained from the literature . the basel  2.2 library of stellar spectra ( lejeune et al .",
    "1998 ) was used to produce a template of synthetic photometric colors at different @xmath32 and for the metallicities of individual mc clusters .",
    "hr diagrams of individual clusters with agb sequences were constructed using @xmath14 derived from observed integrated fluxes of individual stars and @xmath15 obtained from the sed fitting procedure ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "agb ages of individual clusters derived using different sets of isochrones , as well as those obtained from msto in previous studies , are given in table 1 .",
    "there is indeed a good agreement between agb ages obtained using isochrones of bertelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ; b94 ) or lejeune & schaerer ( 2001 ; ls01 ) on one hand , and msto estimates on the other .",
    "agb ages obtained with girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ; g00 ) isochrones are however considerably older than msto estimates ( table  1 ) .",
    "this effect tends to increase with decreasing metallicity .",
    "it should be stressed , thus , that these intrinsic discrepancies between different sets of isochrones clearly indicate a need for better understanding of stellar evolution on the agb , to fully exploit the potential of agb stars for tracing stellar populations in the galaxy and beyond .",
    "possibilities for tracing star formation histories using agb stars with gaia , employing photometric metallicities , gravities and reddenings ( gaia 1x medium band photometric system , vanseviius & bridius 2002 ) are summarized in table  2 ( the error in age for a single star , @xmath33 , is a lower limit since it reflects only the errors in @xmath15 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "we conclude that , contrary to msto dating , agb stars may provide precise estimates of ages ( @xmath35 gyr ) throughout the galaxy and beyond ( @xmath36 kpc ) for populations within a large range of metallicities , even if interstellar extinction is non - negligible . to achieve this ,",
    "metallicities to @xmath37  dex , and effective temperatures to @xmath38  dex are highly desirable .",
    "a precise knowledge of interstellar reddening ( @xmath9 ) is also essential .",
