    "recent results from the macho and eros collaborations have ruled out massive compact halo objects ( machos ) as the bulk the galactic dark matter in the mass range @xmath8 to a few solar masses @xcite , thus eliminating the main candidate for baryonic dark matter in the milky way .",
    "however , there still remains a window between several solar masses and around one thousand solar masses @xcite , where black holes or other machos , could make up the dark matter of the milky way .",
    "it was shown by carr and hawking ( 1974 ) that primordial black holes could have formed at very early stages in the universe as a result of initial inhomogeneities , and recent work has focussed on the spike in the primordial black hole mass spectrum that could arise during the quark - hadron phase transition in the early universe ( e.g. jedamzik 1997 ) . as reviewed by carr ( 1994 ) , the density relative to critical density , @xmath9",
    ", in compact dark objects with masses of 0.01  20 @xmath10 must be less than 0.1 ( increasing , however , to @xmath111 for 60  300 @xmath10 objects ) , limits determined by line - to - continuum microlensing effects in quasars ( dalcanton et al .",
    "these limits still allow the milky way halo to consist largely of such objects . for comparison , galactic chemical enrichment arguments , assuming a standard initial stellar mass function and standard stellar evolution , limit the remnants of population iii stars to @xmath12 for remnants in the range 4  200 @xmath10 ( carr , bond , & arnett 1984 ) . however , there are no strong limits on black holes or non - topological soliton states arising from the early universe or on relics from a non - standard very early generation of stars .",
    "more recently , the microlensing surveys are setting the best limits on the fraction of dark objects in our own dark halo over a wide range of masses .",
    "the above collaborations search for machos using the fact that when a compact dark object passes in front of a source star in a nearby dwarf galaxy , the source star suffers a temporary magnification due to gravitational microlensing @xcite .",
    "the duration of this magnification is determined by a combination of the lens distance , velocity , and mass , and this degeneracy means that the lens mass can not be uniquely determined for an individual lensing event unless other information is available .",
    "however , for a given halo model an average over the lens density and velocity distributions can be made and an average duration can be estimated @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the time for the source to cross the einstein ring diameter .",
    "the 13  17 events discovered by the macho collaboration in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) have durations ranging from about 30 days to about 130 days ( alcock et al .",
    "2000a ) , indicating lens masses in the @xmath15 to @xmath16 range .",
    "however , the number of events found , while larger than the expected background of 24 events from known stellar populations , is significantly less than the 6080 events expected if the dark matter consisted entirely of objects in this mass range .",
    "thus a most likely macho halo fraction of 20% was found , and a 100% macho halo was ruled out at 95% c.l .",
    "earlier eros @xcite and macho @xcite searched for events with durations of less than 10 days and found none , limiting the macho fraction of dark matter to less than 25% in the range from @xmath8 to @xmath17 .",
    "finally , and most powerfully for the high mass end , the eros collaboration @xcite did a combined analysis of all their microlensing surveys of the magellanic clouds , and set a 95% c.l .",
    "limit that objects in the @xmath8 to @xmath18 range do not constitute 100% of the dark halo , and objects less than @xmath16 contribute less than 40% of the dark halo .",
    "in this letter we improve on these limits in the high mass region by performing a search for events with durations longer than 150 days .",
    "we did not find any such events and therefore can improve the upper limit to around @xmath3 .",
    "the data used in this analysis is precisely the data used in alcock et al .",
    "( 2000a ; hereafter a2000a ) , to which we refer the reader for details . in brief , this dataset includes 5.7 years of data on 11.9 million stars in the lmc .",
    "these comprise 21,570 images taken over 30 @xmath19 fields in two filter bands , with the number of exposures per field ranging from 180 to 1338 .",
    "the photometry of these objects was arranged in lightcurves and searched for microlensing using the analysis and statistics described in a2000a .",
    "event selection was performed using those statistics , and in this paper we consider selection criteria similar to the set a selection criteria described in a2000a , which was the more conservative of the two sets of selection criteria used there .",
    "after removal of variable stars and background supernovae this set of selection criteria gives 13 microlensing events , with fit durations between 34 days and 103 days .",
    "this corresponds to physical durations between 42 days and 126 days when a statistical correction for blending is made .",
    "we note that one event ( event 22 ) was considered marginal in a2000a and excluded by hand from event set a for reasons described in a2000a .",
    "further study of this event shows that the source is extended and contains emission lines that are not characteristic of stellar objects .",
    "event 22 seems likely to be a supernova of exceptionally long duration or an agn in a galaxy at redshift @xmath20 and , therefore , is very unlikely to be microlensing .",
    "our redshift is based upon spectra with wavelength coverage 4340 - 9017 angstrom obtained with the dbs spectrograph on the 2.3 m telescope at siding springs observatory .",
    "the exclusion of event 22 is relevant for this paper since this event is the longest duration candidate microlensing event with @xmath21 days .",
    "see a2000a and alcock et al .",
    "( 2000b ; hereafter a2000b ) for details of data taking , analysis , and event selection .",
    "the spirit of the current analysis is similar to that used in the alcock et al .",
    "( 1996 ) search for planetary mass dark matter , but applied to the long - duration end of our data rather than the short - duration end .",
    "we create a simple set of selection criteria similar to selection criteria set a , but tailored to find only events with durations longer than 150 days .",
    "no such events are found , so any galactic dark matter model that predicts more than 3 microlensing events is ruled out at 95% c.l .",
    "many sets of selection criteria were explored , but since our final result at the high mass end depends very little on which set of cuts we use , we choose simply selection criteria a from a2000a with the additional constraint  @xmath22 days \" .",
    "thus the complete set of selection criteria we use is described in table 3 of a2000a .",
    "this set of cuts gives no candidate microlensing events .",
    "using this set of cuts , we then calculate the complete photometric efficiency as a function of input @xmath14 with the method described briefly in a2000a and in detail in a2000b and vandehei ( 2000 ) .",
    "this efficiency calculation takes into account inefficiencies caused by bad weather , seeing , telescope slips , etc . , and includes a careful treatment of blending .",
    "blending occurs when a single photometered object actually consists of several underlying stars , only one of which is microlensed .",
    "see a2000b for a detailed discussion .",
    "the resulting efficiency is shown in figure 1 , along with the efficiency for criteria a from a2000a .",
    "this efficiency is then convolved with the predicted distribution of microlensing durations from a halo model to find an expected number of microlensing detections if the galactic halo consisted 100% of machos .    for simplicity , we use model s from alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) which is given by    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the halo density , @xmath25 is the local dark matter density , @xmath26 is galactocentric radius , @xmath27 is the galactocentric radius of the sun , and @xmath28 kpc is the halo core radius . with the standard thin disk ,",
    "this model has a total rotation speed at 50 kpc of 200 km / s , with 190 km / s coming from the halo , giving a total halo mass of @xmath29 out to 50 kpc .",
    "we assume an isotropic maxwellian distribution of velocities with a 1-d rms velocity of @xmath30 , and assume a @xmath31-function macho mass function of arbitrary mass @xmath32 .    in figure  2",
    "we plot the resulting expected number of events as a function of macho mass .",
    "the number of events is poisson distributed .",
    "therefore , when the number of expected events is @xmath33 , the probability of detecting 0 events is @xmath34 ) . for @xmath35 , one has @xmath36 .",
    "thus any model that predicts more that 3 events is ruled out at 95% c.l .",
    "we note that if a continuous range of masses is ruled out , then any mass function containing only masses in the ruled out range is also ruled out ( griest 1991 ) .    using the number of expected events from figure 2 ,",
    "we easily derive figure 3 , the exclusion plot for the new analysis , with the area above the solid line being ruled out at 95% c.l .",
    "we see that objects with masses between @xmath0 and @xmath1 can not make up 100% of the dark halo in this model . combining these limits with earlier limits @xcite , that are stronger at lower masses where the microlensing surveys have their peak sensitivity , we see that objects with masses under @xmath4 can not make up more that 40% of the galactic dark matter in this model . note that since the microlensing experiments can only detect macho dark matter , the fractional limit on the dark halo mass is strongly dependent on the total amount of dark matter assumed to exist in the dark halo .",
    "since this is quite uncertain , a more model independent way to state these results is that at 95% c.l .",
    ", less that @xmath2 in compact objects with masses less than @xmath3 can be present in the milky way dark halo , and less than @xmath37 can be present in compact objects with masses less than @xmath4 .",
    "limits on halo fraction will scale roughly with the total mass out to 50 kpc in a given halo model ; that is , a model with twice as much dark matter will have a limit of around 50% rather than 100% at @xmath3 .",
    "the limits given in this paper are the strongest to date on compact halo objects with masses above 1 @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , black holes or other dark compact objects with masses less than @xmath3 can not make up the bulk of the dark matter .",
    "we do note , however , that the present survey / analysis does not have much sensitivity to objects with masses greater @xmath3 .",
    "there is a large background of slowly varying variable stars which must be removed , and our main signal - to - noise cuts are not very good at distinguishing these from microlensing .",
    "thus we rely primarily on a long flat baseline , and on a direct cut on the fit event duration ( @xmath38 days ) to remove this background .",
    "unfortunately , these cuts also limit our ability to detect long duration events coming from high mass lenses .",
    "we expect that analysis of the complete 8-year data set will go some way towards solving this problem and we expect to be able to push the current limit to higher masses , or to present long duration microlensing events when that dataset has been analyzed .",
