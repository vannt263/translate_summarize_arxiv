    "photonic crystals , which consist of a periodically arranged lattice of dielectric scatterers , have attracted substantial research interest over the past decade @xcite .",
    "most commonly these structures are used to trap , guide , and otherwise manipulate pulses of light , and have led to a variety of important applications in modern nanophotonics , including extremely high - q electromagnetic cavities @xcite and slow - light propagation of electromagnetic pulses @xcite . however , a new and increasingly important application of photonic crystal structures is in the field of photovoltaics .",
    "it has long been known that structured materials can be used to achieve photovoltaic conversion efficiency beyond the yablonovitch limit @xcite , and indeed researchers have recently proposed photonic crystals @xcite and arrays of dielectric nanowires @xcite as inexpensive ways to create highly efficient absorbers .",
    "recent research in this area has been driven by advances in nanostructure fabrication @xcite concurrent with increased investment in renewable energy technology ( for the latest developments see  @xcite ) .",
    "one aspect in which the use of photonic crystals in photovoltaics differs markedly from their employment in optical nanophotonics is the important role played by material absorption . for most nanophotonic applications absorption",
    "is an undesirable effect which must in general be minimized and can in many cases be neglected .",
    "this is in stark contrast to photovoltaics , in which the main aim is to exploit the properties of the structure to increase the overall absorption efficiency .",
    "modeling of absorbing photonic crystals has thus far been performed using direct numerical methods such as the finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method @xcite , the finite element method ( fem ) @xcite or using the transfer matrix method @xcite .",
    "although these methods have produced valuable information about the absorption properties of such structures they do not allow us to gain direct physical insight into the mechanism of the absorption within them .",
    "furthermore , these calculations require substantial computational time and resources .    here",
    "we present a rigorous modal formulation of the scattering and absorption of a plane wave by an array of absorbing nanowires , or , correspondingly , an absorbing photonic crystal slab ( fig .",
    "[ slab ] ) .",
    "the approach is a generalization of diffraction by capacitive grids formulated initially in refs @xcite for perfectly conducting cylinders .",
    "in contrast to conventional photonic crystal calculations the material absorption is taken into account rigorously , using measured values for the real and the imaginary parts of the refractive indices of the materials comprising the array .",
    "our formulation can be applied to array elements of arbitrary composition and cross - section .",
    "the semi - analytical nature of this modal approach results in a method which is quick , accurate , and gives extensive physical insight into the importance of the various absorption and scattering mechanisms involved in these structures .",
    "the method is based on an expansion in terms of the fundamental eigenmodes of the structure in each different region . within the photonic crystal slab the fields",
    "are expanded in terms of bloch modes , while the fields in free space above and below the slab are expanded in a basis of plane waves .",
    "these expansions are then matched using the continuity of the tangential components of the fields at the top and the bottom interfaces of the slab to compute fresnel interface reflection and transmission matrices .",
    "an important aspect of this approach is that the set of bloch modes must form a complete basis .",
    "this is not a trivial matter , as even for structures consisting of lossless materials the eigenvalue problem for the bloch modes is not formally hermitian .",
    "however , it is well known from the classical treatment of non - hermitian eigenvalue problems that a complete basis may be obtained by including the bloch modes of the adjoint problem . here",
    ", we use the fem to compute both the bloch modes and the adjoint bloch modes . because the mode computation may be carried out in two dimensions ( 2d ) like waveguide mode calculations , this routine is highly efficient .",
    "we note that a previous study @xcite , undertaken using a different method , failed to locate some of the modes , as is demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ section : dispersion ] ; we emphasis that the algorithm presented here is capable of generating a complete set of modes .",
    "in addition the fem allows us to compute bloch modes for arbitrary materials and cross sections .",
    "we note that this approach differs from earlier formulations @xcite in which the photonic crystal had to consist of an array of cylinders with a circular cross - section . with the modes",
    "identified , the transmission through , and reflection from , the slab can be computed using a generalization of fresnel reflection and transmission matrices , and the absorption is found using an energy conservation relation .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "the theoretical foundation of the method is given in sec .",
    "[ formulation ] while the numerical verification , validation and characterization of the absorption properties of a particular silicon nanowire array occurs in sec .",
    "[ applica ] .",
    "the details of the mode orthogonality , normalization , completeness as well as energy and reciprocity relations are given in the appendices .",
    "as mentioned in sec .  [ intro ] , we separate the solution of the diffraction problem into three steps , one involving the consideration of the scattering of plane waves at the top interface and the introduction of the fresnel reflection and the transmission matrices for a top interface ( fig .  [ slab ] ) .",
    "next we introduce the fresnel reflection and transmission matrices for the bottom interface by considering the reflection of the waveguide modes of the semi - infinite array of cylinders at the bottom interface . then the total reflection and transmission through the slab can be calculated using a fabry - perot style of analysis .",
    "the approach is based on the calculation of the bloch modes and adjoint bloch modes of an infinite array of cylinders . before doing so",
    "however , we first provide the field s plane wave expansions above and below the photonic crystal slab .      in a uniform media such as free space ,",
    "all components of the electromagnetic field of a plane wave must satisfy the helmholtz equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the free space wavenumber . here",
    "we consider the diffraction of a plane wave on a periodic square array of cylinders with finite length ( see fig .  [ slab ] ) .",
    "in such a structure , the fields have a quasi - periodicity imposed by the incident plane wave field @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "that is , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a lattice vector , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are integers .",

    "( [ qp ] ) and so @xmath10",
    ". hence @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is an integer .",
    "it follows then that the coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath14 are discretized as follows @xmath15 and form the well known diffraction grating orders .",
    "we split the electromagnetic field into its transverse electric @xmath16 and the transverse magnetic @xmath17 components ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the transverse electric mode",
    ", the electric field is perpendicular to the plane of incidence , while for the transverse magnetic mode the magnetic field vector is perpendicular to the plane of incidence  with the plane of incidence being defined by the @xmath18-axis and the plane wave propagation direction given by the vector @xmath19 .",
