    "controlling magnetism on the ultrashort time scale of sub-100  ps has become an important research subject , not only for the potential applications in novel high density and high speed magnetic recording technologies but also for the unique opportunity to investigate magnetism on the fundamental time scales of the interactions between electrons , spins and lattice.@xcite the demonstration in 1996@xcite of a rather unexpected ultrafast sub - ps demagnetization in a thin ni film upon femtosecond laser excitation inspired a large number of following studies.@xcite of particular importance was the surprising demonstration of a deterministic magnetization reversal by the sole action of a single 40  fs laser pulse in gdfeco rare earth - transition metal ( re - tm ) alloys.@xcite the microscopic mechanism responsible for this phenomenon , now referred to as all - optical switching ( aos ) , remains debated .",
    "element selective studies of the ultrafast demagnetization in gdfeco alloys led to the interpretation that aos is driven by the heating from the laser pulse and is therefore independent of the laser polarization and largely insensitive to any applied magnetic field.@xcite the helicity dependent aos reported earlier could then be understood in terms of a differential light absorption induced by the magnetic circular dichroism in the magnetic alloy.@xcite finally , as these re - tm alloys usually display chemical inhomogeneities , the role of super - diffusive spin currents is also being discussed.@xcite    while early studies concentrated on gdfeco alloys , magnetization switching by laser pulses has now been reported in a growing range of systems , namely other re - tm alloys  @xcite and multi - layers,@xcite re - free synthetic ferrimagnets  @xcite and granular ferromagnets.@xcite these recent developments are raising a number of crucial questions for the understanding of the aos phenomenon and its transfer to real world applications . among these , the exact role played by the magnetization compensation temperature @xmath0 at which the magnetization of the two sub - lattices cancel each other remains a puzzle . on the one hand , strong changes in the magnetization dynamics upon crossing @xmath0 have been observed  @xcite and aos seems to occur preferably for alloys displaying a @xmath0 which can be reached through laser excitation.@xcite on the other hand , atomistic simulations of the spin dynamics as well as experiments have shown that aos is feasible below and above @xmath0.@xcite in addition , helicity dependent magnetization switching in granular ferromagnets where no @xmath0 exists has been reported.@xcite finally , in view of potential applications , it is crucial to be able to characterize to which extent aos is a deterministic process .    in this article , we investigate all - optical magnetization switching in gdfe based alloys using photo - emission electron microscopy ( peem ) with x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) as a contrast mechanism , allowing imaging of the magnetic domain configuration with a spatial resolution of approximately 100  nm .",
    "single linearly polarized laser pulses were used to excite a multi - domain configuration at temperatures below and above the magnetization compensation temperature @xmath0 of the alloys .",
    "introducing the pearson product - moment correlation coefficient on series of xmcd images allows us to report a nearly purely deterministic aos in both cases .",
    "extrinsic pulse to pulse laser pointing stability and intrinsic finite domain sizes and thermally activated domain wall motion are found to be the main limiting factors for a purely deterministic aos . using time - resolved xmcd peem imaging of the magnetization dynamics upon femtosecond laser excitation with 70  ps time resolution and approximately 200  nm spatial resolution",
    ", it is found that aos can even be achieved against a 180  mt applied magnetic field .",
    "finally , strong reduction of the switching window above @xmath0 is observed and is partly related with the proximity of the curie temperature @xmath1 of the sample .",
    "in order to resolve the magnetic domain configuration and its dynamics upon aos , the elmitec photoemission electron microscope ( peem ) at the surface / interface : microscopy ( sim ) beamline@xcite at the swiss light source ( sls ) was used . employing the x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) effect at the fe l@xmath2 edge at 708 ev , a quantitative determination of the fe spin orientation with a 100  nm spatial resolution is possible .",
    "@xcite from two images recorded with opposite x - ray helicity , an asymmetry image is computed which contains only normalized magnetic contrast information .",
    "such image typically shows white or black regions corresponding to magnetic domains with magnetizations of opposite directions with respect to the x - ray propagation vector.@xcite time - resolved measurements of the sample magnetization were performed by taking advantage of the pulsed nature of the x - rays produced by the sls via the gating of the detection in synchronization to an isolated x - ray pulse .",
    "this scheme , presented in detail in ref .  , allows stroboscopic pump - probe imaging of the sample with a time resolution determined by the 70  ps full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) temporal x - ray pulse length . at this time scale ,",
    "both tm and re magnetizations are in equilibrium such that measuring the fe sub - lattice is sufficient to characterize the sample magnetization orientation .",
    "the pump laser pulses were produced by an xl-500 oscillator from femtolasers produktions gmbh which are characterized by a wavelength of @xmath3 = 800  nm , a pulse duration of @xmath4 = 50  fs with an energy of 500  nj per pulse at a 5.2 mhz repetition rate .",
    "this repetition rate is then reduced by a pockels cell in combination with a crossed polarizer to match the 1.04 mhz repetition rate of the isolated x - ray probe pulses .",
    "the linearly p - polarized laser pump pulses were focused on the sample at a grazing incidence of 16@xmath5 to a spot size of about 30@xmath6100  @xmath7m@xmath8 fwhm .",
    "the time overlap ( @xmath9 ) between the laser and the x - ray pulse is unambiguously determined to better than @xmath1015  ps by the sudden space charging  @xcite which is induced by the laser pump pulse which reduces significantly the amount of photo - emitted electrons collected by the microscope .",
    "finally , the sample could be cooled down with a flow of liquid nitrogen and the temperature measured with a thermocouple attached to the sample holder .",
    "the samples are grown on si substrates to achieve fast cooling time during mhz repetition rate experiments  @xcite and are capped with a 3  nm si@xmath2n@xmath11 layer to prevent oxidation .",
    "three different samples have been used for this study . the first sample of composition si / alti(10  nm)/si@xmath2n@xmath11(5  nm)/gd@xmath12fe@xmath13co@xmath14(20  nm)/si@xmath2n@xmath11(3  nm ) has a @xmath0 of 260  k. the two other samples are gdfe alloys of composition",
    "si / si@xmath2n@xmath11(5  nm)/gd@xmath15fe@xmath16(30  nm)/si@xmath2n@xmath11(3  nm ) with a @xmath0 below 10  k and si / si@xmath2n@xmath11(5  nm)/gd@xmath17fe@xmath18(30  nm)/si@xmath2n@xmath11(3  nm ) with a @xmath0 above 500  k. in the rest of the paper , each sample is referred to by a reduced notation consisting of the gd content like for example gd25feco or gd20fe .",
    "in view of potential applications , the question of the repeatability of aos is essential .",
    "aos was therefore studied on a multi - domain configuration were one laser pulse excites several different magnetic domains at once . the magnetic domain configuration before and after single linearly polarized laser pulse exposure was recorded with static xmcd peem imaging .",
    "sequences of such @xmath19 images taken at the fe @xmath20 edge for the gd25feco sample at a temperature above and below @xmath0 in the absence of any applied magnetic field are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sstm ] ( a ) and ( c ) respectively . in those images , white ( black ) contrast corresponds to magnetic domains whose out - of - plane magnetization has a positive ( negative ) projection on the x - ray direction , as indicated by the gray scale in figs .  [",
    "fig : sstm ] ( a ) and ( c ) . in both cases , below and above @xmath0",
    ", changes in the magnetic domains in the center of the images are seen . to better emphasise the changes or the lack of them occurring in these multi - domains configuration , the pixel by pixel product between two successive images separated by a single linearly polarized laser pulse excitation @xmath21",
    "is computed and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sstm](b ) and ( d ) .",
    "irrespective of the initial magnetic domain orientation , in the @xmath21 image , a black contrast corresponds to a magnetization switching ( sw ) , a gray contrast to a domain wall ( dw ) and a white contrast to an absence of changes , _ i.e. _ no switching ( ns ) , as indicated by the gray scale in the inset .",
    "visible in the product of successive images @xmath21 shown in fig .  [ fig : sstm](b ) and ( d ) is a black elongated elliptical region at the center surrounded by a white region unaffected by the laser pulses .",
    "this elongated elliptical shape corresponds to the laser spot size seen at the 16@xmath5 grazing incidence used in this experiment .",
    "this black elongated region clearly corresponds to a laser induced switching occurring equally for both magnetic domain orientations enclosed in the laser spot size .",
    "since this aos seems to occur with every laser pulse , it appears to be purely deterministic . to better quantify how deterministic this phenomenon of aos really is",
    ", we introduce the pixel - by - pixel pearson product - moment correlation coefficient @xmath22 for a sequence of xmcd images as : @xmath23 where @xmath19 is the xmcd image after @xmath24 laser pulses in the sequence . in the case of purely deterministic switching , this correlation coefficient @xmath22 is -1 , while in the absence of changes , _",
    "i.e. _ no switching , @xmath22 = + 1 . in the event of an unrelated domain configuration after every single laser pulse , such as in the case of heating above @xmath1 , @xmath22 = 0",
    ". such correlation coefficient images @xmath22 calculated from the measured sequences are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sstm](e ) and ( f ) for a sample temperature above and below @xmath0 respectively .",
    "the darkest region in these images corresponds indeed to a correlation coefficient of @xmath22 = -1 , _ i.e. _ a purely deterministic switching with each of the 10 laser pulse of the sequence , occurring both below and above @xmath0 .",
    "it is also evident that the spatial extent of this @xmath22 = -1 region is limited by the spatial extent with which these 10 laser pulses overlap .",
    "therefore , the pulse to pulse pointing stability is the only extrinsic limitation to a somewhat purely deterministic aos",
    ".    however , there can also be intrinsic limitation such as domain walls , in particular at the boundary between the switching and non switching region of each laser pulse .",
    "for example , in the case of the sample temperature above @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sstm](b ) , the domain wall at the bottom of the laser pulse region is nearly continuously moving in the same direction between successive images , as indicated by the red arrows as well as the dashed ellipse in fig .",
    "[ fig : sstm](e ) . as",
    "this domain wall is clearly outside the elongated elliptical region where aos occurs , we know that the laser fluence is too low to induce a deterministic aos . in fact , in the xmcd peem images @xmath25 and @xmath26 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sstm](a ) , one can even see the domain wall motion occurring during the imaging which results in an extended gray region rather than a either completely black or completely white region .",
    "this is indicative of a very low coercivity of the domain walls at this temperature which favors thermally activated domain wall movements in the otherwise non switching region and should be regarded as intrinsically limiting the repeatability of the aos . comparing the domain size above and below @xmath0 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sstm](a ) and ( c ) , one can immediately realize that the coercivity is higher in the second case as the magnetic domains are smaller , and thus more stable .",
    "nevertheless , here some changes in the domain configuration can also be seen at the edges of the aos region , as indicated by the blue arrow in the @xmath27 image shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sstm](d ) .",
    "the small protuberance corresponds to a small black domain outside the aos region which disappeared between the images @xmath28 and @xmath26 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sstm](c ) .",
    "this is likely the collapse of a too small domain formed by the intersection of the existent domain pattern and the aos region created by the laser pulse .",
    "these processes of domain collapse and thermally activated domain wall hopping should not be confused with aos .",
    "in fact , they lower the repeatability of aos .    inside the @xmath22 = -1 region",
    ", all magnetic domains are switching with every laser pulse .",
    "however , it is unclear what is happening for the domain wall separating them since the correlation coefficient @xmath22 is undefined there . to visualize the various domain wall position during the sequence of laser pulses , it is best to look at the low intensity part of the average of the squared image @xmath29 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sstm](g ) and ( h ) for the sample temperature above and below @xmath0 , respectively . in those @xmath29 images , the darker the domain wall , the less it moved during the sequence of laser pulses . in the case of the sample at a temperature above @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sstm](g ) , some changes are visible at the domain wall inside the switching region , as indicated by the red arrow . in the case below @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sstm](h ) , no changes are visible , meaning that the domain wall stayed in place within the 100  nm spatial resolution of the instrument . considering the low coercivity of this material , this is a rather surprising and noteworthy feature of aos .",
    "nevertheless , evidences for potential domain wall hopping well inside the @xmath22 = -1 region are seen at least in one case , limiting the repeatability of the aos .",
    "overall , apart from the difference in coercivity , very little differences are seen between aos below and above @xmath0 .",
    "to gain more insight into the aos and in particular into the role played by @xmath0 , the magnetization dynamics in this sample was investigated around @xmath0 .",
    "for this , time - resolved xmcd peem measurements were performed and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tr_tm ] , for a sample temperature ( a ) above and ( c ) below @xmath0 , and for a strong h = 180  mt and a weak h = 30  mt out - of - plane magnetic field . the magnetic field is used to reset the sample magnetization to a well defined initial state , allowing for stroboscopic measurement of the dynamics . the first thing to notice",
    "is that at negative time delay @xmath30 , i.e. before the laser pulse , the sample is saturated for both applied magnetic fields , and that the orientation of the fe sub - lattice magnetization reverses between fig .",
    "[ fig : tr_tm](a ) and ( c ) , meaning that the sample is effectively on either side of the magnetization compensation temperature @xmath0 at the temperature used . from the time - resolved xmcd images ,",
    "the magnetization dynamics at the center can be extracted and is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : tr_tm](b ) and ( d ) , for a sample temperature above and below @xmath0 , respectively . in both cases , magnetization switching occurs right after the laser pulse excites the sample .",
    "thus , within the 70  ps time resolution of the experiments , no difference is seen in the switching dynamics for either low or high magnetic field and either below or above @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the relaxation towards the final state is strongly influenced by both the applied magnetic field and the sample base temperature .",
    "at a temperature above @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tr_tm](b ) , the reversed state is instable against the applied magnetic field , leading to a fast relaxation towards the initial state , the faster the higher the field .",
    "it is worth noting here that switching with a laser pulse against a field of 180  mt is thus possible , even though the relaxation is very fast , demonstrating the impetuous by which this aos occurs .",
    "@xcite due to this fast relaxation and the 70  ps long x - ray probe pulse length , a saturated switched state is not observed . at temperatures below",
    "@xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tr_tm](d ) , the reversed state is now stable within the illuminated area , indicating that the temperature in this region is now above @xmath0 . in this case , after the laser pulse , the applied magnetic field is now stabilizing the reversed domain , leading to a very long life time .",
    "time - resolved xmcd peem images taken at the same fixed time delay of @xmath30 = + 230  ps after the laser pulse on the same gd25feco sample are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flutm](a ) above and ( b ) below @xmath0 , as a function of the laser pump fluence . a small static out - of - plane magnetic field of h = 30  mt was applied to reset the sample after switching .",
    "this 30  mt magnetic field is small enough to not hinder the aos at this time scale as can been seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tr_tm](b ) . while below @xmath0",
    ", the laser fluence can be increased significantly without losing the aos , the same is not true above @xmath0 . there , a small 10% increase from 2.7 to 3.0 mj@xmath31@xmath32 is enough to bring the central region of the laser spot into a demagnetized state .",
    "this effect is most striking at the fluence of @xmath33 = 3.5  mj@xmath31@xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig : flutm](a ) , where the switched region forms a very thin 2  @xmath7 m wide ring around the laser pulse .",
    "the aos fluence switching window is thus reduced above @xmath0 , and this asymmetry of the switching window around @xmath0 is consistent with literature .",
    "@xcite part of this effect might be attributed to the proximity with the curie temperature @xmath34 .",
    "due to the limited accessible temperature range in the peem , investigation of the aos far from @xmath0 requires samples with different compositions . for this",
    ", time - resolved xmcd peem measurement were thus performed on gd20fe with @xmath0 around 0  k and gd24fe with @xmath0 around 500  k , under a small static out - of - plane magnetic field of 30  mt . the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gdfe ] . for both samples",
    ", a time resolution limited demagnetization process occurs .",
    "the samples then stay demagnetized for about 500  ps which is then followed by a slow dynamics on a time scale of around 10  ns , towards the initial state for gd20fe and towards the reversed state for gd24fe .",
    "this reversal in the gd24fe sample shows that there is an accessible magnetization compensation temperature @xmath0 in this sample below @xmath1 , allowing the applied 30  mt out - of - plane magnetic field to reverse the sample magnetization on a slow few nanoseconds long time scale and eventually back to the initial state at even longer time scale after cooling down . for the gd20fe sample ,",
    "the temperature is already above @xmath0 before the laser pulse , and therefore no magnetic field assisted switching occurs .",
    "looking at the xmcd peem images taken at fix time delay and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gdfe](a ) , it can be seen that in the case of the gd20fe sample , the demagnetized region has a diffuse boundary , meaning that no magnetic domain is actually formed . on the other hand , for gd24fe",
    ", at around 750  ps after the laser pulse , a clear boundary appears in the heated region , which is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gdfe](a ) at t = 3.1  ns .",
    "this very late formation of the reversed domain in gd24fe and the absence of switching in gd20fe allow us to conclude that no aos window exists far from @xmath0 .",
    "determining if a system can display all - optical magnetization switching and to which extent this aos is deterministic are two questions of crucial importance , for a better understanding of the phenomenon as well as in view of its potential applications . in this context",
    ", sequences of xmcd peem images separated by single linearly polarized laser pulse excitation on a multi - domain configuration such as shown in fig.[fig : sstm ] can provide valuable information .",
    "first of all , since linearly p - polarized laser pulses are equally absorbed by each domain orientation , a direct comparison between what happens inside each domain is possible.@xcite this is in contrast with multiple circularly polarized laser pulses used in recent studies such as in refs .   and  , where such a comparison can only be made after carefully taking into account the magnetic circular dichroism of the material .",
    "second , randomly demagnetized initial states are better than saturated or artificially created domain states since no stray field is created which could influence the switching .",
    "third , the reversed domain configuration in such case is known to be stable as well , therefore a collapse of the reversed domain state because of too low coercivity or too high net magnetization is not to be expected.@xcite finally , from such a sequence of images , the actual reproducibility of aos can be measured using the pearson product - moment correlation coefficient @xmath22 as introduced .    from our analysis",
    ", it follows that the purely deterministic aos observed in the gdfeco samples is limited by a number of extrinsic and intrinsic effects .",
    "the largest limitation we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : sstm](e ) and ( f ) is the pulse to pulse laser pointing stability which is extrinsic in nature to the switching phenomenon itself .",
    "the second limitation observed is related to the stability of the domain configuration .",
    "for example , at the edge of the laser pulse , the overlap of the @xmath22 = -1 switching region with the preexistent domain configuration can create domains which are too small to be stable , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sstm](d ) @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , thermal activation of domain walls can occur outside as well as inside the @xmath22 = -1 switching region , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sstm](g ) and indicated by the arrow and dashed ellipse . since these two effects are related to the coercivity of the material , this constitutes an intrinsic limitation to the repeatability of the aos .",
    "however , by understanding these limitations , we can envisage that engineered materials can potentially alleviate these limitations .",
    "for example , in patterned materials where each structure preferably host a single magnetic domain , a purely deterministic switching would be maintained .",
    "regarding the role played by the magnetization compensation temperature @xmath0 on the aos , we first of all confirm previous studies in that aos occurs below and above @xmath0.@xcite single shot laser pulse experiments shown in fig .  [ fig : sstm ] as well as time - resolved measurements of the magnetization dynamics shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tr_tm ] both reveal aos below as well as above @xmath0 .",
    "however , there exists a clear difference between switching below and above @xmath0 , as shown in the fluence - dependent patterns observed at @xmath30 = 230  ps in fig .",
    "[ fig : flutm ] .",
    "in addition , for gdfe samples with no or far from their @xmath0 , no switching is observed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gdfe ] .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that while the existence of a reachable @xmath0 during the laser excitation is not a strict requirement to observe aos , sample compositions with @xmath0 near room temperature are preferred .",
    "it must be noted that in addition to @xmath0 , an angular momentum compensation temperature @xmath35 also exists at a slightly higher temperature.@xcite however , our experimental geometry with out - of - plane magnetic field does not allow magnetization precession dynamics to be observed , precluding any investigation of the effect of @xmath35 on aos .",
    "finally , aos is a very robust switching mechanism as it can be realized against an opposing applied magnetic field  @xcite , as demonstrated experimentally here in the case of a 180  mt field in fig .",
    "[ fig : tr_tm](b ) .",
    "in conclusion , using static and time - resolved peem microscopy with xmcd to probe the sample magnetization upon laser excitation , important aspects of the aos have been revealed .",
    "sequences of images after single linearly polarized laser pulse excitation on a multi - domain configuration allow for the study of the repeatability of the process by using the correlation coefficient as its measure .",
    "it is found the aos in the gd25feco sample studied is nearly purely deterministic .",
    "moreover , intrinsic limitation from the low coercivity of the material leading to thermally activated domain wall hopping could be alleviated in patterned media . from the time - resolved measurement of the magnetization dynamics",
    ", it is found that aos occurs below and above @xmath0 , while on the other hand , no aos occurs for sample temperatures far from it .",
    "strong reduction of the fluence switching window occurs above @xmath0 and is likely related to the proximity with the curie temperature @xmath1 .",
    "finally , aos against an applied magnetic field of 180  mt is demonstrated , illustrating the impetus by which aos occurs .",
