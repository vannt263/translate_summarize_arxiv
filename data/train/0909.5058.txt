    ", hyperons are expected to appear at relatively small densities , @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to the variety of particle species , partial restoration of chiral symmetry is also expected in nuclear medium , and it would modify the properties of dense matter significantly .",
    "therefore , it is desired to respect both hypernuclear physics information  @xcite and chiral symmetry  @xcite in constructing the dense matter eos .",
    "it is widely believed that hyperons should emerge such as in the neutron star core  @xcite , and/or during the black hole formation  @xcite , as the baryon density increases in the hadronic matter . in neutron stars , hyperon admixtures",
    "soften the eos and reduce the maximum mass of neutron stars .",
    "they also increase the proton fraction , which may promote faster cooling processes  @xcite .",
    "in black hole formation processes , hyperons are abundantly produced due to temperature or density effects , and shorten the duration time of neutrino emission  @xcite .",
    "hyperon admixtures are governed by the hyperon potentials in nuclear matter , which may be determined from the hyperon separation energies from hypernuclei and hyperon production spectra . from this point of view",
    ", we need to adopt a theoretical framework which can explain both nuclear matter and finite nuclear properties .    a chiral symmetry is another important ingredient in dense matter .",
    "it is a fundamental symmetry of qcd with massless quarks , and its spontaneous symmetry breaking generates masses of constituent quarks and hadrons  @xcite .",
    "hadron properties and eos would be modified in nuclear matter due to the partial restoration of the chiral symmetry  @xcite .",
    "thus it is preferable for hadronic many - body theories to possess the chiral symmetry , including its spontaneous breaking and partial restoration at finite densities .",
    "we have recently developed a chiral su(2 ) symmetric relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model , abbreviated as scl2 rmf , with a logarithmic @xmath3 potential in the form of @xmath4  @xcite , which is derived from the strong coupling limit of lattice qcd ( scl - lqcd )  @xcite .",
    "if we navely include the vector meson in the linear @xmath3 model ( @xmath5 theory ) , the chiral symmetry is found to be restored below the normal nuclear density ( lee - wick vacuum , or chiral collapse )  @xcite . to avoid this problem ,",
    "there are several attempts some of which result in having instability at large @xmath3 values  @xcite or too stiff eos  @xcite . in the scl2 rmf",
    ", we do not have any instability in the @xmath3 potential , and the obtained nuclear matter eos is found to be reasonably soft .",
    "in addition , the bulk properties of finite nuclei ( binding energies and charge rms radii ) are well described .",
    "then it is desired to extend the scl2 to the su@xmath6(3 ) version in order to describe hypernuclear systems .",
    "we expect that this extension enables us to get detailed information of various hypernuclei .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a chiral su(3 ) symmetric rmf model , abbreviated as scl3 rmf in the later discussion , as an extension of scl2 rmf .",
    "some of the model parameters are constrained by chiral symmetry through the hadron masses and vacuum condensates , and some of them are determined by the nuclear matter and finite nuclear properties .",
    "we also determine remaining parameters , meson-@xmath0 coupling constants , by adopting the su@xmath7 symmetric relation for vector couplings and fitting existing @xmath0 hypernuclear data for scalar couplings .",
    "we show that we can reproduce the separation energies of single @xmath0 hypernuclei ( @xmath8 )  @xcite and the @xmath9 bond energy ( @xmath10 ) in @xmath11he  @xcite by choosing the coupling constants appropriately .",
    "the eos of symmetric matter is found to be softened by the scalar meson with hidden strangeness , @xmath12 , which couples with @xmath3 through the determinant interaction representing the effects of u@xmath13 anomaly  @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the neutron star matter eos and neutron star maximum mass in the present scl3 rmf .",
    "it is generally preferable to derive the dense matter eos from bare baryon - baryon interactions .",
    "non - relativistic calculations based on the variational method  @xcite and the g - matrix  @xcite have been carried out based on realistic bare baryon - baryon interactions .",
    "these non - relativistic microscopic calculations only with two body forces do not reproduce the nuclear matter saturation point , and three - body forces are found to be essential to explain the saturation property of symmetric nuclear matter  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the modern microscopic _ nn _ ,",
    "_ yn _ , and _ yy _ interactions were examined with three - body forces in the framework of brckner hartree - fock theory .",
    "the calculated results of the maximum neutron star mass suggest the importance of the hyperon admixture and the three - body force in neutron star core . in the relativistic brckner hartree - fock ( rbhf )",
    "theory  @xcite , empirical nuclear matter saturation is explained quantitatively .",
    "it should be noted that a part of the three - body force effects are taken into account in rbhf via z - type diagrams which come from relativistic treatments , but rbhf results in ref .",
    "@xcite do not include the bare three - body forces such as those via baryon resonances .",
    "the eos in rbhf is approximately reproduced in rmf with non - linear @xmath14 interaction , which is introduced to simulate the high density behavior of the vector potential  @xcite . in this work",
