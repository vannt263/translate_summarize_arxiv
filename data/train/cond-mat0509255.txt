    "the classical kuramoto model @xcite describes a collection of globally coupled phase oscillators that exhibits a transition from incoherence to synchronization as the coupling strength is increased past a critical value . since real world networks typically have a more complex structure than all - to - all coupling @xcite , it is natural to ask what effect interaction structure has on the synchronization transition . in ref .",
    ", we studied the kuramoto model allowing general connectivity of the nodes , and found that for a large class of networks there is still a transition to global synchrony as the coupling strength exceeds a critical value @xmath0 .",
    "we found that the critical coupling strength depends on the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix @xmath1 describing the network connectivity .",
    "we also developed several approximations describing the behavior of an order parameter measuring the coherence past the transition .",

    "most networks considered in applications are directed @xcite , which implies an asymmetric adjacency matrix , @xmath3 .",
    "also , in some cases the coupling between two oscillators might drive them to be out of phase , which can be represented by allowing the coupling term between these oscillators to be negative , @xmath4 . the effect that the presence of directed and mixed positive / negative connections can have on synchronization is , therefore , of interest . here",
    "we show how our previous theory can be generalized to account for these two factors .",
    "we study examples in which either the asymmetry of the adjacency matrix or the effect of the negative connections are particularly severe and compare our theoretical approximations with numerical solutions .",
    "in ref .   we considered the onset of synchronization in networks of heterogeneous coupled phase oscillators .",
    "this situation can be modeled by the equation , @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the phase and natural frequency of oscillator @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the total number of oscillators .",

    "we note that in this example , in contrast with the examples discussed so far , there is variation in the values of the order parameter predicted by the fda for different realizations of the network .",

    "in particular , with positive connections , the condition for neglecting @xmath181 was that the number of connections to each node was large .",

    "our theories work satisfactorily in this case , and , since the results are similar to those in fig .",

    "numerically , we find that for matrices constructed as in this example there is a real positive eigenvalue and that , furthermore , it is well separated from the largest real part of the remaining eigenvalues ( see fig .  [ eithe ] ) .",
    "we also find this for other values of @xmath162 provided @xmath177 is not too small .",
    "we provide a discussion of this issue and show the spectrum of the adjacency matrix in appendix [ appendixa ] .",

    "( [ eq : secondpt ] ) and ( [ eq : eta1dire ] ) ] gave a good description of synchronization , but that the directed mean field approximation gave a transition to synchronization at a coupling substantially below that observed .",
    "in contrast , for example ( i ) , in which the coupling matrices were individually asymmetric but their ensemble average was symmetric , the mean field theory ( and all the other theories in sec .  [ dire ] ) gave good results .",

    "for example ( iii ) we found that iteration of eq .",
    "( [ eq : betaprime3 ] ) converges to a fixed point with @xmath190 , and thus the result is similar to the case where all connections are positive .",
    "in example ( iv ) , the result of iteration of eq .  (",
    "[ eq : betaprime3 ] ) yields nontrivial values for the phases @xmath36 .",
    "in this case we found good agreement between the solutions of ( [ eq : coupled ] ) and the theory for the order parameter for @xmath147 large ( @xmath191 ) , but that for smaller @xmath147 ( @xmath192 ) , although yielding qualitatively similar behavior to that observed ( fig .",
    "[ inhi54 ] ) , the theory overestimates the order parameter .",
    "analogous to similar observations for symmetric networks with only positive coupling @xcite , we speculate ( sec .  [ examples ] )",
    "that this is a finite size effect associated with the fact that the effective number of connections given in this example by @xmath193 is not sufficiently large to justify neglect of @xmath181 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupled0 ] )    in order to isolate the effect of the asymmetry and the negative connections , we considered networks in which the degree distribution is very narrow .",
    "the combined effect of these factors with different heterogeneous degree distributions ( e.g. , scale free networks @xcite ) and with correlations in the network ( in particular , degree - degree correlations ) is still open to investigation .    in practice",
    ", one could be interested in networks in which the asymmetry in the connections is strongly correlated with the sign of the coupling ( in analogy to some models in neuroscience @xcite ) .",
    "although we did not study such a case here , we believe our theory provides a good starting point to study the emergence of synchronization in these kind of structured complex networks .",
    "in this appendix we discuss the characteristics of the spectrum of the adjacency matrices considered in our examples .",
    "although we will focus here on asymmetric matrices , a similar argument works for symmetric matrices .",
    "the matrices we consider are relatively sparse , with the position of the nonzero entries being chosen randomly ( e.g. , in the symmetric case , the position of the nonzero entries is chosen when constructing the network using the configuration model ) , and their values being also determined randomly from a given probability distribution ( e.g. , @xmath110 with probability @xmath162 and @xmath163 with probability @xmath164 ) .",
    "our interest is focused on the gap between the largest real eigenvalue ( if there is one ) and the largest real part of the other eigenvalues . in ref .",

    "we find that this approach also succeeds in describing the spectrum of the matrices in our examples . in our case ,",
    "the diagonal entries are @xmath116 , so that the average eigenvalue is also @xmath116 as in ref .  .",
    "we find that there is always a largest real eigenvalue approximately given by the mean field value @xmath198 ( see refs .  ) , where @xmath199 and @xmath200 , which in the case considered in ref .",
