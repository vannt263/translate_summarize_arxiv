    "following the discovery of topological insulators@xcite , intense theoretical efforts have resulted in a good understanding of topological phases of free fermions , including a complete classification of such phases that are stable to disorder@xcite . in these phases",
    "the bulk appears , to local probes , as a rather conventional gapped state .",
    "the surface however is gapless unless one of the symmetries protecting the phase is broken .",
    "in contrast our understanding of topological phases of interacting particles is much less complete .",
    "the fractional quantum hall effect has inspired much work on phases with topological order@xcite .",
    "these states have the remarkable property that the degeneracy of their ground states depends on the topology of the space on which they are defined .",
    "while they are often associated with edge states , additionally , excitations with exotic statistics occur in the bulk .",
    "moreover , these states are characterized by a topological entanglement entropy , implying long range quantum entanglement in the ground state .",
    "it seems appropriate to exclude such phases in a minimal generalization of topological insulators to interacting systems .",
    "we define a short range entangled ( sre ) state as a gapped state with a unique ground state on all closed manifolds i.e. no topological order . in the presence of interactions ,",
    "do new sre phases appear that share the same symmetry , but differ at the level of topology ?",
    "a possible distinction , for example , is the presence of protected states at the boundaries .    in this paper",
    "we study the physics of such phases in systems of interacting bosons . for bosons",
    "the non - interacting limit is a simple condensate so that interactions are necessary to stabilize gapped phases .",
    "thus we necessarily need to free ourselves from the crutch of free fermion hamiltonians and band topology upon which most current discussions of topological insulators are based . studying bosonic generaizations of topological insulators",
    "is potentially a useful step toward the harder problem of interaction dominated fermionic topological insulators .",
    "several examples of interacting boson systems exist .",
    "a very natural realization of a strongly interacting boson system is a quantum magnet made up of localized quantum spins on a lattice . in that context",
    "the phases we are interested in may be dubbed  topological paramagnets \" .",
    "they have a bulk gap , no bulk topological order or fractional quantum numbers , but have protected surface states all in close analogy to electronic topological insulators .",
    "the topological paramagnet should be distinguished from a more familiar ( and more exotic ) paramagnet - the quantum spin liquid state - which has been extensively discussed in the literature .",
    "quantum spin liquid states either have bulk topological order or gapless excitations .",
    "other realizations of strongly interacting bosons are ( of course ) provided by ultracold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "a famous example of a topological paramagnet already exists : the spin-@xmath3 haldane ( or aklt ) chain .",
    "this has a bulk gap , no fractionalization , but has dangling spin-@xmath4 moments at the edge that are protected by symmetry@xcite . using a powerful matrix product representation of gapped states@xcite topological phases in one dimension",
    "are completely classified by the second group cohomology of symmetry group g. in 2d and 3d such rigorous results are not available .",
    "however , it was pointed out by kitaev that 2d sre phases of bosons with chiral edge states are nevertheless possible @xcite .",
    "recently , chen , liu , gu and wen@xcite have proposed that sre topological phases of bosons protected by symmetry , are captured by the higher dimensional cohomology groups .",
    "while this provides an efficient mathematical scheme to enumerate phases , unfortunately their properties are not transparently obtained .",
    "progress on clarifying the physics of these states was subsequently made by several authors .",
    "levin and gu@xcite explicitly studied a specific example in 2d protected by z@xmath5 symmetry . later , 2d sre topological phases were described using a simpler chern - simons approach@xcite , which provides a field theory and explicit edge theories of these states .",
    "it was found that bosons with a conserved global u(1 ) but no other symmetries can display an ` integer quantum hall state ' with quantized hall conductance predicted to be even integer multiples of @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the elementary charge of the bosons@xcite .",
    "a simple physical realization of such a phase of two component bosons in the lowest landau level has been provided@xcite .",
    "other physical interpretations have also appeared @xcite .",
    "thus , defining properties of several ` symmetry protected topological ' ( spt ) phases in 1d and 2d are now understood .",
    "however in 3d , though the cohomology classification predicts various spt phases , including bosonic generalizations of topological insulators , their physical properties have not thus far been elucidated .",
    "this will be our primary task .",
    "potentially , our approach could also be used to classify 3d bosonic spt phases , which we leave to future work .",
    "we note however that for all symmetry classes that we considered both with time reversal ( @xmath9 ) and without ( @xmath10 ) we identify candidate phases that exhaust those predicted by the cohomology classification@xcite .",
    "further , we identify a possible topological phase that appears to be outside the classification of ref ..    much of our discussion will focus on a theory of the novel surface states of these three dimensional bosonic topological insulators .",
    "we construct effective  landau - ginzburg \" field theories of these surface states .",
    "we also identify bulk field theories that correctly yield the proposed surface theory .",
    "a key feature of this surface theory is that it does not admit a trivial gapped symmetry preserving surface phase .",
    "the surface either spontaneously breaks symmetry , or if gapped , develops surface topological order ( even though there is no bulk topological order ) .",
    "other more exotic symmetry preserving states with gapless excitations are also possible . in all these cases",
    "the defining global symmetries are implemented in a way not allowed in strictly two dimensional systems . as",
    "a specific example - consider insulating bosonic phases with the symmetries of a topological insulator , i.e. charge conservation and time reversal symmetry ( formally denoted as @xmath11 ) .",
    "then , the surface could break a symmetry , e.g. by forming a surface superfluid .",
    "alternately , the surface can remain insulating , while breaking time reversal symmetry .",
    "the bulk is assumed to retain the symmetry .",
    "then , these surface ordered phases can reflect their special origin by exhibiting features that are forbidden in purely two dimensional phases .",
    "for example , the vortices of the surface superfluid above will be shown , in a precise sense , to be fermionic furthermore , the surface insulator with broken time reversal symmetry will be shown to have a hall conductance of @xmath12 ( in units of @xmath6 ) , in contrast to the 2d integer quantum hall phases of bosons which are only allowed to even integer hall conductance .",
    "equivalently , the surface quantum hall effect may be considered a quantized three dimensional response , the magneto - electric polarizability @xmath0 .",
    "recall , in the context of free fermion topological insulators with broken time reversal on the surface that gaps the surface states , have a quantized magneto - electric effect appears@xcite that is captured by the topological theta term : @xmath13 ( we have set @xmath14 and @xmath15 are applied electric and magnetic fields ) . for fermion",
    "topological insulators @xmath16 @xmath17 , corresponding to a half integer hall effect on the surface .",
    "the @xmath1 ambiguity in @xmath0 corresponds to the fact that one may deposit a fermionic integer quantum hall layer on the surface@xcite .    here , for bosonic topological insulators",
    ", @xmath0 is _ only _ defined modulo @xmath18 , and the topological phase corresponds to @xmath19 .",
    "this implies , for example , the domain wall between opposite time reversal symmetry breaking regions on the surface induces a protected mode , the edge state corresponding to the @xmath20 quantized hall effect of bosons .",
    "the @xmath18 ambiguity in @xmath0 corresponds to the fact that one may deposit an integer quantum hall layer of bosons on the surface , which must have an _ even _ integer hall conductance .",
    "a symmetry preserving surface state may be accessed from the superfluid by condensing vortices which transform trivially under the symmetry .",
    "however as the vortex of the surface superfluid has fermionic statistics it can not condense .",
    "this precludes the possibility of a trivial gapped surface insulator .",
    "the fermionic vortices can of course pair and condense .",
    "however as is well known@xcite paired vortex condensation leads to a two dimensional state with topological order ( described in the present context by a deconfined @xmath21 gauge theory ) .",
    "this surface topological order will be shown to realize symmetry in a manner not allowed in strictly two dimensional systems .",
    "exotic gapless surface states that preserve all symmetries are also conceivable .",
    "for example , the gapless surface state may intuitively be viewed as a quantum hall state that fluctuates between @xmath12 .",
    "the theory of such a state is constructed using a network model that captures the quantum phase transition between distinct integer quantum hall states of bosons .",
    "the same approach , when applied to fermionic topological insulators correctly yields the single dirac cone surface state .",
    "the field theory thus obtained of the bosonic model poised at the transition , naturally leads to the required surface theory , which is closely related to the deconfined quantum critical theory@xcite , previously proposed in the context of frustrated quantum magnets .    _",
    "3d field theory : _ the general arguments above will be shown to be consistent with the following @xmath22 field theory : @xmath23 where the index @xmath24 refers to boson species , and bosons four currents are represented by @xmath25 while the curl of @xmath26 represents the vortex lines .",
    "the first ` bf ' term@xcite just represents the @xmath1 phase factor of taking a particle around its vortex .",
    "the key topological properties however are determined by the second term , which attaches quantum numbers to vortices . to avoid topological order at the surface , and ensure bosonic excitations , @xmath27 and diagonal entries are even integers . in most cases",
    "we will take two species with @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath29 is assumed to lead to an equivalent theory that only differs in details of surface termination .",
    "furthermore , time reversal symmetry constrains @xmath30 , the latter being the topological phase .",
    "note , @xmath31 for the internal gauge fields @xmath26 should be distinguished from the @xmath0 for the external electromagnetic field we discussed above .",
    "coupling to an external electromagnetic field allows one to obtain the quantized magneto electric effect discussed above .",
    "related theories have appeared in the context of three dimensional topologically ordered phases and superconductors @xcite where only the first @xmath2 term in eqn.[bfoverview ] appears with a different coefficient . on the other hand",
    "the field theory discussed in ref .",
    "retains only the second term , which leads to gapless excitations in the bulk , as noted in ref . , which differ from the gapped phases of interest here .",
    "thus , it will be important to combine both these terms .",
    "recently , it was proposed that free _ fermion _ topological insulators are captured by similar theories , @xcite with a single component field and the first term of eqn . [ bfoverview ] along with coupling to the external field .",
    "the surface states in such theories were argued to be bosonized dirac fermions@xcite .",
    "while this is an intriguing idea , we point out certain problems ( see appendix [ appendixbfsurface ] ) with the identification of a metallic surface in ref . .",
    "moreover , identification of a bulk fermionic operator is also problematic in this theory .",
    "one approach , taken in a recent paper@xcite , is to regard this as a partial theory , that provides a purely hydrodynamic description that excludes fermionic excitations altogether .",
    "thus , finding a complete effective field theory description for 3d fermionic topological insulators remains an open problem .",
    "we also display continuum field theoretic models in @xmath32 dimension that realize some of the topological phases we describe .",
    "these are obtained as perturbations of non - linear sigma models in the presence of a topological theta term .",
    "the theta term has the effect of endowing topological defect configurations of the continuum fields with non - trivial global quantum numbers .",
    "we show the connection to the topological bf theory and to the theory of protected surface states .    _ possible phases with",
    "half quantized surface thermal hall effect : _ interestingly , our general approach and the theory in eqn .",
    "[ bfoverview ] predicts a new 3d spt phase , protected by time reversal symmetry , that is not obtained within the cohomology classification of chen et al.@xcite just as the quantized hall effect of @xmath33 sre bosons immediately constrained the physics in 3d , an analogous argument for thermal hall conductance can be made . in @xmath34 , this is quantized to 8 times the quantum of thermal conductance : @xmath35 , for a 2d sre phase of bosons .",
    "a realization of @xmath36 is the kitaev @xmath37 state@xcite , with 8 chiral bosons at the edge .",
    "therefore , a three dimensional phase protected by time reversal symmetry can be conceived , on whose surface a domain wall between opposite t breaking regions will host 8 chiral boson modes and is described by eqn .",
    "[ bfoverview ] , with the 8 dimensional @xmath38 matrix , discussed in .",
    "this putative phase lies outside the cohomology classification of chen et al.@xcite , which reports a single non - trivial topological phase with this symmetry , for which a different candidate , with @xmath28 is identified below .",
    "as this paper is long and discusses bosonic spt phases from several points of view it is helpful to provide an overview .",
    "we seek an effective  landau - ginzburg \" description of the surface of a 3d spt phase .",
    "we employ various approaches , that , satisfyingly , lead to consistent conclusions . below we motivate these different approaches as preparation for the rest of the paper .",
    "a key physical requirement of the surface theory is that there be no trivial gapped symmetry preserving surface phase .",
    "this feature is reminiscent of the lieb - schutlz - mattis ( lsm ) theorem @xcite and its generalization@xcite to states of bosonic systems at a fractional filling on clean @xmath39 lattices . indeed in both cases either a symmetry must be broken or there is topological order , or more exotic long range entanglement possibly with protected gapless excitations .",
    "there is however one important difference . for the surface states discussed in this paper , the trivial insulating phase does not exist _ even _ in the presence of disorder that breaks translation symmetry .",
    "they are protected by internal symmetries rather than by lattice translation symmetry ( as is the case for lsm ) .",
    "nevertheless we will exploit insights from existing effective field theories of clean lattice bosons that build in the lsm restrictions to construct the desired surface theory of the bosonic topological insulator .",
    "we begin with a physical discussion of the constraints on quantized electrical and thermal response in sre 3d bosonic insulators , imposed by our knowledge of 2d sre phases ( * section * [ sec : gentrnsprt ] ) .",
    "in particular we argue that the quantized magnetoelectric coupling for bosonic topological insulators ( @xmath19 ) is double that of the fermionic case ( @xmath16 ) , which parallels the doubling of hall conductance@xcite for 2d integer states of bosons compared to fermions .",
    "next , we borrow an approach that is useful in classifying spt phases of 2d bosons . there ,",
    "the edge states are typically described by a 1d luttinger liquid theory .",
    "what makes them special is that symmetry acts on these edge states in a way that is impossible to realize in a purely 1d system@xcite .",
    "this ensures that all perturbations that lead to a gapped phase also break symmetry . by analogy , to discuss a 3d spt phase we model the 2d surface by a conventional 2d theory of bosons ( e.g. an xy model ) .",
    "however , we identify symmetry operations which are forbidden in a conventional 2d system , by demanding the 2d system can never enter a trivial gapped phase .",
    "u(1 ) ) and time reversal symmetry ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the bulk is insulating and corresponds to a condensate of vortices of both species ( shown as black and white loops ) . in the topological phase",
    ", the vortex line of one species that ends on a surface carries half charge of the other species .",
    "such a surface , it may be argued , does not have a trivial gapped phase , where the symmetries are preserved .",
    "pictorially , the vortex lines may be viewed in 1d haldane phases , with half charged end states . ]    as a useful device consider an enlarged @xmath41 global symmetry , along with time reversal symmetry @xmath42 ( technically @xmath43 \\rtimes z_2^t$ ] ) and eventually break it down to the symmetry of interest .",
    "physically , this corresponds to separate conservation of two species of bosons species 1,2 . consider the surface of a 3d spt phase , with a broken symmetry eg . a condensate of species 1 bosons , that breaks the first u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "this superfluid must also be unusual - in that it can not be connected to a fully symmetric insulator .",
    "guidance from effective field theories of clean 2d lattice bosons at fractional filling suggests thinking in terms of the vortices of the superfluid .",
    "since the insulating state is obtained by condensing vortices , we can ask what vortex properties provide the required obstruction . unlike a particle",
    ", a vortex is a non - local object , and can transform projectively under the remaining @xmath44 and @xmath42 symmetry .",
    "vortices with projectively realized symmetries provide an obstruction to realizing a trivial insulator , and can describe the surface of an spt phase . in this example , the projective transformation requires the two species of vortices ( @xmath45 ) carry half charge of species 2 , which are exchanged by time reversal symmetry .",
    "a minimal theory of these vortices is obtained by representing the density of the condensed species 1 by the curl of a vector potential @xmath46 , which couple minimally to the vortices .",
    "@xmath47    where we have inserted external electromagnetic fields @xmath48 that couple to the two conserved currents .",
    "to obtain an insulating surface we must condense the vortices , but this inevitably breaks symmetry . since the vortices transform into one another under time reversal , one can not condense one species and not the other .",
    "condensing them both however implies the breaking the other u(1 ) symmetry , since the vortices carry charge of species 2 . a third option is to condense pairs of vortices , but this results in z@xmath5 topological order@xcite .",
    "this points to a schematic picture of the spt phase as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "a bulk insulator may be regarded as a condensate of vortex loops . however , the special feature here is that the condensed vortex lines carry a half charge at their ends when they intersect the surface .",
    "the vortex lines , viewed as one dimensional objects , are in a topological state analogous to the haldane phase , and thus carry edge states .    note that if a single bosonic vortex species was present at low energies , we could perform a duality back to the usual boson phase variables .",
    "however , having multiple vortex fields demands a dual description like the one above .",
    "in fact an identical theory appeared in the discussion of deconfined quantum critical points@xcite , where however the symmetries included both internal and spatial symmetries . here",
    "all symmetries are internal and hence are restricted to the surface of a 3d topological phase .",
    "let us consider in more detail the insulating surface obtained on breaking time reversal symmetry .",
    "this is obtained by condensing just one species of vortex say @xmath49 , in eqn.[deccpsurface ] which forces @xmath50 . when substituted into the action above this",
    "yields the electromagnetic response @xmath51 .",
    "if the separate species are now identified with a single conserved charge , we can set @xmath52 which yields @xmath53 on the surface , indicating a magneto electric response @xmath19 , as advertised . in the absence of time reversal breaking , the surface may be assumed to fluctuate between @xmath54 .",
    "we provide an alternate derivation of the same surface theory eqn.[deccpsurface ] by modeling this by a network model , poised at the transition point between two bosonic integer quantum hall states .",
    "this is analogous to obtaining the surface state of the 3d fermionic topological insulators , the single dirac cone , by a network model at the critical point between integer quantum hall plateaus@xcite in a clean system . in both cases ,",
    "the time reversal symmetry automatically tunes the system to criticality . for the bosonic spt surface ,",
    "resulting theory is an o(4 ) non - linear sigma model with a topological term as in the euclidean lagrangian below : @xmath55\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the o(4 ) vector has been written in terms of an su(2 ) matrix @xmath56 .",
    "reassuringly , this has been argued in ref . to be equivalent to eqn .",
    "[ deccpsurface ] once appropriate anisotropies are introduced .",
    "these two descriptions of surface properties of spt phases are discussed in * section * [ sec : surface ] along with the connection between them .",
    "we also emphasize the properties of a gapped symmetric surface state obtained by condensing paired vortices .",
    "this state has surface topological order described by a deconfined @xmath21 gauge theory ( even though the bulk has no such order ) .",
    "this state provides a particularly simple perspective on why a trivial gapped symmetric phase is forbidden at the surface .",
    "indeed we will show that bosonic topological quasiparticles of this state carry fractional quantum numbers . destroying the topological order by condensing one of these quasiparticles necessarily breaks a symmetry .",
    "not surprisingly we show that the implementation of symmetry in this surface topological ordered state is distinct from what is allowed in strict 2d systems .    in the remaining sections",
    "bulk theories that are consistent with the surface descriptions above are discussed in * section * [ sec:3d ] .",
    "spt phases in quantum magnets - the ones we dubbed topological paramagnets - protected by other symmetries such as time reversal ( @xmath40 ) , or time reversal along with one component of spin rotation ( @xmath57 ) are described in * section * [ sec : othersymm ] .",
    "an example without time reversal symmetry ( @xmath10 ) is discussed in the appendix .",
    "finally , we discuss a new topological phase that is predicted by this approach , a 3d extension of kitaev s e@xmath58 state , along with miscellaneous comments in * section * [ sec : e8 ] .",
    "we begin by considering a system of interacting bosons in @xmath59 space dimensions in the presence of time reversal and particle number conservation symmetries . specifically let us consider the situation where the boson field @xmath60 carries charge @xmath3 under a global @xmath44 symmetry and transforms as @xmath61 under time reversal .",
    "the corresponding symmetry group is @xmath62 .",
    "assume it is in a gapped insulating phase ( at least in the absence of any boundaries ) and that there is a unique ground state on topologically non - trivial manifolds .",
    "for any such insulator in 3d , the effective lagrangian for an external em field obtained by integrating out all the matter fields will take the form @xmath63 the first term is the usual maxwell term and the second is the ` theta ' term in eqn .",
    "[ ltopo ] :    several properties of the theta term are well known . first under time reversal , @xmath64 .",
    "next on closed manifolds , the integral of @xmath65 is quantized to be an integer so that the quantum theory is periodic under @xmath66 .",
    "these two facts together imply that time reversal symmetric insulators have @xmath67 with @xmath68 an integer .",
    "trivial time - reversal symmetric insulators have @xmath69 while free fermion topological insulators have @xmath70 .",
    "if we allow for a boundary to the vacuum and further assume that the boundary is gapped ( if necessary by breaking time reversal symmetry ) , then the @xmath0 term leads to a surface hall conductivity of @xmath71 . to see this , assume a boundary ( say at @xmath72 ) , @xmath73 is zero for @xmath74 and constant @xmath0 for @xmath75 .",
    "the action associated with the @xmath0 term is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the external electromagnetic potential and @xmath78 .",
    "this is a surface chern - simons term and leads to a hall conductivity @xmath79 .    for fermion topological insulators",
    "@xmath70 so that the surface @xmath80 .",
    "if we shift @xmath81 , then the surface @xmath82 .",
    "this corresponds to simply depositing an ordinary integer quantum hall state of fermions at the surface of this insulator - hence this should not be regarded as a distinct bulk state so that the only non - trivial possibility is @xmath83 .",
    "now let us consider bosonic insulators .",
    "again t - reversal and periodicity imply @xmath84 and a surface @xmath85 .",
    "a crucial observation is that now @xmath86 must be regarded as * distinct * from @xmath69 . at @xmath86 the surface @xmath87 . but this can not be obtained from the surface of the @xmath69 insulator by depositing any 2d integer quantum hall state of bosons .",
    "recent work@xcite has shown ( see ref . for a simple argument ) that 2d iqhe states of bosons necessarily have @xmath88 even .",
    "thus the surface state of the @xmath86 boson insulator is not a trivial 2d state but rather requires the presence of the 3d bulk .",
    "therefore @xmath86 necessarily corresponds to a non - trivial 3d bosonic ti .",
    "@xmath89 is however trivial as then the surface state can be regarded as a 2d bosonic iqhe state .",
    "one may still obtain a 3d topological phase , but the topology is not manifest in the electromagnetic response .",
    "we can sharpen and generalize this result . under t - reversal as @xmath90 , @xmath91 . as the bulk state is t - reversal invariant",
    "we require that the surface state at @xmath92 be obtainable from the surface state at @xmath93 by depositing a 2d iqhe boson state .",
    "let us characterize the surface state by both its electrical and thermal hall conductivities @xmath94 . under t - reversal both",
    "hall conductivities change sign .",
    "the requirement above then means that @xmath95 must correspond to the allowed electrical / thermal hall conductivity of a 2d boson iqhe state .    for @xmath86",
    ", it follows that @xmath96 .",
    "it is thus  half \" of the elementary 2d boson iqhe state .    for @xmath70 ,",
    "@xmath97 and this is not allowed for the 2d bosonic iqhe .",
    "it follows therefore that 3d bosonic tis with no  intrinsic topological order \" can not have @xmath70 .",
    "it is of course very easy to construct such states@xcite ( or other states with fractional @xmath0 ) if we allow for fractionalization of the boson but that violates our original assumption .    a 2d iqhe state with @xmath98 is allowed and is discussed by kitaev .",
    "thus a 3d boson ti with surface @xmath99 is allowed .",
    "combining these two types of fundamental states generates the allowed thermal and electrical hall responses on the surface .",
    "later on in the paper we will discuss how these results fit in with the formal classification of spt and other short ranged entangled phases in 3d .",
    "for now we reiterate the crucial observation of this section : _ a state with em response of @xmath86 necessarily describes a topological insulator of @xmath100-reversal symmetric bosons while @xmath70 requires the presence of  intrinsic topological order\"_. in the next section we study the properties of this @xmath86 boson topological insulator in detail .",
    "in this section we will derive the non - trivial surface theory of one example of a 3d bosonic spt phase .",
    "we will soon specialize to the symmetries of the topological insulator : charge conservation and time reversal symmetry ( @xmath101 ) , and exhibit a nontrivial topological phase in three dimensions , built purely of bosons . to begin with we",
    "will assume that there are two species of bosons whose numbers are separately conserved , and there is enlarged @xmath102 .",
    "later we will break this to just @xmath103 symmetry by including inter - species boson mixing terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "a similar construction @xcite has proven to be very powerful in @xmath34 .",
    "we consider two approaches :    the first approach exploits the fact that a bosonic spt phase in @xmath104 dimensions has surface states that correspond to a conventional theory of bosons in @xmath105 dimensions _ except _ in the way symmetries are implemented .",
    "for example , the edges of spt phases of bosons in d=2 + 1 dimensions correspond to conventional 1d luttinger liquids , except for their unusual symmetry transformations @xcite . we therefore consider a 2d bosonic state to model the surface and assume the surface is a superfluid breaking one of the u(1 ) symmetries .",
    "then , vortices of this condensate may transform under a projective representation of the remaining symmetry group . in a projective representation ,",
    "even the identity element of the symmetry group induces a phase rotation .",
    "hence local operators , that can be physically measured , must remain unchanged under the identity operation of the symmetry group , since this corresponds to ` doing nothing ' .",
    "however , vortices , which are non - local objects , can transform projectively .",
    "one may attempt to restore the u(1 ) symmetry by condensing vortices .",
    "however , the projective transformation ensures that when vortices condense , they necessarily break another symmetry . in this way",
    "both the boson and vortex condensates lead to symmetry breaking , in line with our general expectation for the surface of a 3d spt phase .",
    "it is important that vortices transform projectively , so that they can not be screened by bosons to obtain a trivial representation of the symmetry group .",
    "this is a generalization of the idea of quantum number fractionalization - for example a particle with half charge changes sign under the @xmath1 phase rotation of bosons , implying a projective representation .",
    "clearly , a half charge can not be screened by any finite number of bosons .",
    "projective representations were also recently used to classify spt phases in d=1 + 1where they correspond to the ends of gapped one dimensional topological phases .",
    "for example , the half - integer spin edge states of spin-1 haldane chains furnishes a projective representation of the rotation group .",
    "this suggests a physical picture of a 3d spt phase , in which the vortex line in the bulk is similar to a haldane chain type gapped phase , which necessitates low energy states on the surface where the vortex ends . in this section",
    "we specialize to the symmetries of the topological insulator .",
    "then this procedure explicitly produces a topological phase characterized by quantized magnetoelectric effect @xmath19 .",
    "the second approach will be to directly implement the property discussed above in section [ sec : gentrnsprt ] that if the surface breaks @xmath100-reversal and is gapped then it has quantized hall transport . if @xmath100-reversal is not broken a powerful approach to obtain the surface theory is to start with the theory of the quantum phase transition point between the two bosonic quantum hall phases that correspond to the two @xmath100-broken surfaces . in the case of free fermion",
    "topological insulators , a similar reasoning leads to the single dirac cone surface state that describes the transition between the @xmath106 states on the surface . for free fermions",
    "the transition between these integer quantum hall states is described by a chalker - coddington network model@xcite . for the bosonic problem of interest here",
    "we construct an analogous network model and show it leads to a sigma model with a topological term .",
    "the results of these two approaches are readily seen to be connected . in both cases",
    "the field theories we obtain for the surface have appeared previously in the context of deconfined quantum criticality .",
    "we discuss the phase diagram of the surface states described by these field theories .",
    "when inter - species tunneling is included the vortices of the two species of bosons get confined to each other .",
    "the resulting single vortex no longer transforms projectively under the physical symmetries .",
    "however we argue that it is most conveniently viewed as a fermion .",
    "this precludes the possibility of obtaining a trivial insulating phase at the surface by condensing vortices .",
    "consider a boson field at the surface with phase degree of freedom @xmath107 .",
    "we assume the bulk is insulating and the surface is in the @xmath108 plane .",
    "the surface theory could spontaneously break a global @xmath44 symmetry of boson number conservation ( a surface superfluid ) or stay insulating .",
    "more precisely as the bulk is always assumed insulating , the vortex line loops have proliferated in the bulk .",
    "these vortex lines penetrate the surface at points , which may be viewed as point vortices of the two dimensional surface theory , since there is no vortex line tension in the insulating bulk .",
    "these point vortices are gapped when the surface is a superfluid .",
    "if instead they are condensed the surface will be insulating . to describe vortices we go to a dual description@xcite , where we write the density and currents of the boson @xmath109 on the surface in terms of the field strengths of a gauge field @xmath110 .",
    "in particular the density of bosons is : @xmath111 ( the reason for the subscript 2 on @xmath112 will soon be apparent ) .",
    "the boson insertion operators @xmath113 correspond to monopole insertion operators , since they insert @xmath114 magnetic flux .",
    "now , the vortices @xmath115 are particles that couple minimally to the gauge field @xmath116 . in general there will be multiple vortex species that transform into each other under the symmetry operation .",
    "let us label them by @xmath117 , so @xmath118_i=\\psi_{2i}$ ] .",
    "all these fields couple minimally to the gauge field .",
    "as argued above , one route to obtaining topological surface states is if the surface vortices transform under a projective representation of the remaining symmetry .",
    "vortices that transform projectively under a global symmetry are actually not at all unfamiliar .",
    "it describes the generic situation of two dimensional bosons on a lattice , say , at some commensurate filling@xcite .",
    "these projective vortices play a crucial role in the theory of deconfined quantum criticality .",
    "we will only need to consider two component vortex fields , @xmath121 for a variety of cases considered in this paper .",
    "the gauge invariant combination @xmath122 then defines another bosonic field .",
    "now , eqn . [ nccp1vortex ] closely resembles the action for a deconfined quantum critical point ( non - compact cp@xmath123 theory with easy plane anisotropy ) @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate how this emerges as the theory for the surface states , and also , in the next section , describe a three dimensional bulk theory that leads to this edge theory .",
    "these are the symmetries of the topological insulator , a conserved @xmath44 charge and @xmath40 time reversal symmetry .",
    "the semi - direct product appears so that the charge insertion operator @xmath125 is invariant under time reversal , which involves both @xmath126 and @xmath127 . here",
    "we will construct the surface theory of a 3d topological phase with these symmetries .",
    "let us begin with an enlarged symmetry , two species of bosons that are separately conserved . consider a condensate of one species @xmath109 .",
    "vortices in this condensate are created by the field @xmath115 . we need to specify the projective representation for the vortices @xmath115 and the transformation of the bosons @xmath128 .",
    "the remaining symmetry group @xmath129 has a single projective representation ( p1 ) which acts as follows . under a @xmath44 rotation by angle @xmath130 , the fields @xmath131 and under time reversal : @xmath40 : @xmath132 and @xmath133 . or more compactly :      here the @xmath135 are the pauli matrices in the standard representation .",
    "thus the vortices carry charge @xmath136 , of bosons of the other species .",
    "the time reversal symmetry that interchanges the two vortex fields ensures that the vortex charge is fixed exactly at half .",
    "it is impossible to ` screen ' this charge with regular integer charged bosons .",
    "these transformation laws of course determine how the boson operator @xmath137 and their density @xmath138 transforms .",
    "we also need to specify how the bosons @xmath139 and density @xmath140 transforms .",
    "the symmetry transformations are : @xmath141 the conjugate boson numbers therefore transform as @xmath142    a necessary compatibility check is that eqn .",
    "[ nccp1vortex ] is invariant under the symmetry operation , which can be verified for these transformations .",
    "for example , time reversal symmetry is implemented via eqn .",
    "[ p1p1vortex ] on the vortex fields which is compatible with @xmath138 ( and hence @xmath116 ) remaining invariant while @xmath127 under time reversal .",
    "moreover , since the bosons carry charge , the monopole insertion operators are forbidden .",
    "condensing single vortices will then break symmetry as described below .",
    "this is best analyzed by assuming separate number conservation of each species of boson , @xmath143 , in which case they can be coupled to an _ external _ gauge potential @xmath144 .",
    "then the effective lagrangian eqn[nccp1vortex ] reads :      here @xmath146 .",
    "the @xmath147 are vortex fields of @xmath109 which carry half charge of boson species 2 .",
    "the flux of the gauge field @xmath148 is precisely the conserved density of species @xmath3 ; hence the last term in the above action where the external probe gauge field @xmath149 couples to this current .",
    "this action will need to be modified by including all symmetry allowed perturbations .",
    "we will do this and analyze the possible phases below , but as a preview , consider the effect of breaking time reversal symmetry by condensing just one species of vortex say @xmath150 . anticipating a single charge ,",
    "consider an external field that couples equally to the two charge densities @xmath52 .",
    "the vortex condensate forces @xmath151 , which when substituted into the action above yields the electromagnetic response @xmath152 , which yields @xmath53 on the surface , indicating a magneto electric response @xmath19 , as advertised .",
    "we now change track and obtain the same surface theory from a very different point of view .",
    "the general considerations of section [ sec : gentrnsprt ] showed that a time reversal symmetric boson insulator with electromagnetic response characterized by @xmath86 is in a topological insulator phase .",
    "this key result relied on the observation that if @xmath153 is broken at the surface to gap it out then such a state has a quantized electrical hall conductivity @xmath154 , and a thermal hall conductivity @xmath155 .",
    "what if t - reversal is not explicitly broken at the surface ?",
    "the surface can then potentially be gapless .",
    "what is the nature of the resultant theory ? to construct this theory it is extremely instructive to learn from the example of the free fermion @xmath100-reversal symmetric topological insulator . in that case",
    "if @xmath100 is explicitly broken to gap out the surface , then we get @xmath106 .",
    "when @xmath100 is unbroken , it is possible to get a single massless dirac cone which is exactly the low energy theory of the transition between two integer quantum hall plateaus of fermions in @xmath34 .",
    "generically we can tune the chemical potential to move away from the dirac point to get a fermi surface which encloses the dirac point .",
    "note that the quantized hall conductance jumps by 1 across the integer quantum hall plateau transition .",
    "when applied to the surface of the 3d fermionic topological insulator , the transition connects the two possible @xmath100-breaking surface states that go into each other under time reversal .",
    "thus each such surface state must be assigned @xmath106 and the critical theory itself is time reversal invariant . in contrast",
    "when applied to strictly 2d systems the network model describes a transition between plateaus with @xmath156 and @xmath87 .",
    "the familiar free fermion example gives us a crucial clue to construct the theory of the @xmath100-reversal symmetric surface state of the boson topological insulator .",
    "first construct the low energy theory of the @xmath34 integer quantum hall state of bosons as a potential candidate for the gapless surface state of the @xmath157 topological insulator . then add perturbations allowed by symmetry to obtain the generic surface theory .",
    "across the boson integer quantum hall transition , @xmath88 jumps by 2 . as for the fermionic example , when this transition is realized at the surface of the bosonic topological insulator ,",
    "the two plateau states on ether side of the transition are related by @xmath100-reversal and must be assigned @xmath154 consistent with our earlier arguments .",
    "we will study the phase transition using a  network \" model construction .",
    "the idea is to start with the theory of the edge state and couple together opposite edges .",
    "let us warm up with the familiar example of the iqhe transition of fermions from a state with @xmath87 to one with @xmath156 .",
    "the model is defined by fig .",
    "[ nwrkpic ] .",
    "it is described by the euclidean action @xmath158 with @xmath159 with @xmath160 the first term is the sum of the actions of a single chiral edge mode of the @xmath87 fermion iqhe state taken to propagate in opposite directions for adjacent @xmath117 .",
    "the second term describes electron hopping between opposite moving edge channels .",
    "when @xmath161 all chiral edge channels are paired with partners and @xmath156 .",
    "conversely if @xmath162 , then all edge channels get paired except the two end ones and we get the fermion iqhe state with @xmath87 .",
    "the transition occurs at @xmath163 and is readily seen to yield a single massless dirac fermion in the continuum limit is taken in the @xmath117 direction .",
    "let us now repeat this construction for the bosonic iqhe transition .",
    "the edge theory for the boson iqhe state with @xmath164 has a pair of counterpropagating edge modes - one carries the charge and the other is neutral@xcite .",
    "it is convenient to write the effective action of the edge as an @xmath165 wzw theory : @xmath166\\ ] ] here @xmath56 is a @xmath167 matrix with entries @xmath168 .",
    "the @xmath169 are the two physical boson fields which form the iqhe quantum hall state .    a network model capable of describing the boson iqhe state may now be written down and is defined by fig [ nwrkpicb ] .",
    "again we have an array of opposite edge channels which are coupled together by boson hopping @xmath170 .",

    "the transition occurs at @xmath163 .",
    "a low energy theory of the transition is obtained by taking the continuum limit in the @xmath117 direction .",
    "as the opposite moving edge channels have opposite wzw terms they nearly cancel , and it is necessary to carefully sum them .",

    "the @xmath70 @xmath178 matrix field theory ( with the @xmath41 anisotropy ) or the equivalent easy plane nccp@xmath183 model arise also in the theory of deconfined quantum criticality in two space dimensions .",
    "remarkably we see that the field theories describing the boson iqhe plateau transition ( and hence the surface states of the 3d boson topological insulator ) are closely related to the theory of deconfined quantum criticality . in the previous subsection we obtained this connection from a different point of view .",
    "we will in the rest of the paper explore this connection in more detail and generality .",
    "for now we merely point out that the results of ref .",

    "show that the @xmath70 @xmath178 matrix field theory in two space dimensions does not have a trivial gapped disordered phase .",
    "its phases either break symmetry , are gapless or have topological order .",
    "this is a hallmark of the surface state of a symmetry protected topological phase - there is no trivial gapped phase that preserves all the symmetries .",
    "* surface of the bosonic tis : field theories * we now exploit our intuition about deconfined criticality to obtain the theory of possible surface states of the 3d boson ti starting with the @xmath70 @xmath178 matrix field theory .",
    "we first describe a number of equivalent field theoretic descriptions of the surface state paying particular attention to the realization of the physical @xmath103 symmetry .",
    "first we note that the @xmath178 matrix @xmath56 is related to the physical boson fields @xmath185 through @xmath186 under the global @xmath44 symmetry , both bosons transform with charge @xmath3 , _",

    "[ phitransform],[ntransform ] so that we are indeed describing the same symmetry class in the two approaches .",
    "we remind the reader that the total number @xmath191 of the two boson species is conserved due to the global @xmath44 symmetry but the relative number @xmath192 is in general not .",
    "as promised before we will first analyse the theory in a limit where this relative number is also conserved ( so that there is @xmath41 symmetry ) and then include interspecies tunneling terms to recover the generic case .",

    "the analysis below , following ref . , relies crucially on analysing the symmetries of the edge lagrangian that describes a strictly 2d system .",

    "as we already noted such a charge assignment implies a non - zero hall conductivity ad hence can not describe a strict 2d system with time reversal invariance . thus the surface topological order described above in tables",

    "the @xmath206 dimensional edge theory corresponding to the chern - simons lagrangian above is @xmath207 with @xmath208 .",
    "demanding time reversal invariance of the edge lagrangian we see immediately that the edge densities @xmath209 must transform with opposite signs .",
