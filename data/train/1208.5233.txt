    "<S> understanding the stability of thin film nanomagnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ( pma ) against thermally induced magnetization reversal is important when designing perpendicularly magnetized patterned media and magnetic random access memories . </S>",
    "<S> the leading - order dependence of magnetization reversal rates are governed by the energy barrier the system needs to surmount in order for reversal to proceed . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study the reversal dynamics of these systems and compute the relevant barriers using the string method of e , vanden - eijnden , and ren . </S>",
    "<S> we find the reversal to be often spatially incoherent ; that is , rather than the magnetization flipping as a rigid unit , reversal proceeds instead through a soliton - like domain wall sweeping through the system . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for square nanomagnetic elements the energy barrier increases with element size up to a critical length scale , beyond which the energy barrier is constant . for circular elements </S>",
    "<S> the energy barrier continues to increase indefinitely , albeit more slowly beyond a critical size . in both cases the energy barriers are smaller than those expected for coherent magnetization reversal .    </S>",

    "<S> , we identify the minimum energy paths ( meps ) on the energy landscape , which allow us to determine the transition states ; we then study the dependence of these states , along with their corresponding energy barriers , on sample size and geometry . </S>",
    "<S> our two main conclusions are : ( i ) typically , models that assume uniform magnetization seriously overestimate the magnitude of the activation energy , especially in larger systems ; and ( ii ) even in situations where the assumption of uniform magnetization is valid , that is , in smaller size systems , finite size effects have a strong impact on the value of the energy barrier .    </S>",

    "<S> the small value of @xmath10 permit nonuniform magnetization configurations and the smallest sample behaves more as a macrospin.,width=288 ]    as expected , the activation energy decreases as the field approaches the coercive field .    the activation energy of the macrospin model ( @xmath47 ) </S>",
    "<S> can be obtained using eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the difference in energies between the transition state @xmath49 and the metastable state @xmath50 @xmath51 this relation is shown in fig.[fig : field - dependence - of ] and compared to our numerical results . for large samples </S>",
    "<S> the activation energy is clearly lower than the prediction of the macrospin model , as the macrospin does not account for spatial variation of the magnetization .    </S>",
    "<S> two additional points needs to be made regarding the way the energy barrier changes with the size of the element . </S>",
    "<S> first , we verified that the activation energy barrier is independent of the cell size used in the numerical integration scheme once the cells become smaller than the exchange length ; this is a standard requirement of numerical micromagnetics . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we conclude that our numerical results , such as those shown in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  2 , are not affected by numerical artifacts induced by changing the relative length scales of the system . </S>",
    "<S> second , an effective reduction on the element size can be achieved by increasing the exchange constant to a large value ( @xmath52j / m ) . in this </S>",
    "<S> limit our result should approach the macrospin model even in our largest samples . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : largeavalue ] ,     comparison of two versions of the macrospin model : @xmath46 corresponds to the commonly used thin film limit and @xmath53 is a film with finite aspect ratio . </S>",
    "<S> blue circles are calculated with the string method for a very large exchange constant.,width=288 ]    where the activation energy is compared to two versions of the macrospin model with different magnetostatic tensor components . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that merely increasing @xmath10 is not sufficient to bring the macrospin model into agreement with results found using the string method . </S>",
    "<S> a further refinement of the magnetostatic energy term , in which the film is not treated as an infinite plane , is necessary . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the demagnetization tensor is calculated using formulas due to newell  @xcite for values @xmath35 and @xmath54 . using these results yields a good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that in the macrospin model finite size effects are important even for very small aspect ratio ( @xmath34 ) thin film geometries . </S>",
    "<S> it must be emphasized that the gain in accuracy is obtained without a significant increase in computation time .    </S>",
    "<S> the finite size effect in the limit of large @xmath10 can be explained as follows : if the lateral sample dimensions are comparable with the domain wall width , there is a buildup of surface charge in the lateral faces of the sample as the magnetization reverses ; the sample is effectively a finite rectangular box . for intermediate values of @xmath10 , such that the film can be considered to be wide in the plane but vertically thin ( when compared to the exchange length ) </S>",
    "<S> , the domain wall width becomes much smaller than the lateral dimensions and the wall does not intersect with the sample sides and produce no surface charges . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , there is no contribution to the magnetostatic energy and the sample is effectively an infinite plate . in the infinite plate limit , gioia and james @xcite </S>",
    "<S> have argued that the magnetostatic energy can be absorbed into an effective crystalline anisotropy @xmath55 .    </S>",
    "<S> size effects on the activation energy in square geometries are summarized in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : squaresizedependence ] , where two regimes can clearly be identified . for small samples , the activation energy increases with the size of the element ; here the macrospin model holds . beyond a certain size ( @xmath56 ) </S>",
    "<S> , however , the activation energy becomes essentially constant . for large elements , </S>",
    "<S> the radius of the reversed nucleus is independent of the element size . </S>",
    "<S> for all sizes considered , the reverse domain resembles a circular region with domain walls making right angles with the sample s edge ( see second image at fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : evolvedstring ] ) . at a given configuration eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : completemicromagneticenergy ] ) can be approximated as the sum of three dominant terms : a switched domain with area @xmath57 with energy density per unit area @xmath58 approximate to @xmath59 ; an unswitched domain with downward magnetization of area @xmath60 and surface energy density @xmath61 ; and the domain wall of length @xmath62 with a linear energy density per unit length @xmath63@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy @xmath64 is maximum for @xmath65 , with an activation energy of @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a good approximation to the energy plateau presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : squaresizedependence ] . </S>",
    "<S> our estimate for @xmath67 predicts to good approximation the onset of the plateau region in the activation energy : the samples must be large enough to accommodate the nucleus of size @xmath67 at a distance of at least a few exchange lengths from the corners of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> a direct measurement from the numerical magnetization configuration gives @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> the width of the domain wall is expected to be @xmath69 ; we obtain a numerical value of @xmath70 . we expect that the narrowing of the domain wall is the result of dipole - dipole interactions at the interface between the two regions . </S>",
    "<S> since the magnetostatic interaction favors antiparallel configurations , the spatial rate of twist perpendicular to the domain wall increases . the increase in exchange energy is compensated by a decrease of magnetostatic energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the optimum radius @xmath67 can be obtained from the above prescription to be : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the exchange length and @xmath73 is the uniaxial material parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the optimum radius depends on @xmath12 and diverges as @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> this is reasonable since in the absence of an external field there is no preferred magnetization direction , and so the energy barrier is produced by a straight wall parallel to one of the sides of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to obtain a reasonable estimate of the energy barrier we need to impose two conditions . </S>",
    "<S> first , we must guarantee that the switched domain fits in the sample by @xmath75 ; second , we require the domain wall width to be smaller than the square side @xmath76 . rewriting @xmath77 as @xmath78 and using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : optimumr ] ) we arrive at the following condition on the external magnetic field for our model to be valid : @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , with @xmath80  nm , the condition is @xmath81 t. when this condition is satisfied the activation energy can be estimated by @xmath82    the behavior of the energy barrier for square samples results from the presence of sharp corners that favor nucleation . in contrast , circular shapes do not present such behavior . fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : squaresizedependence ] shows the computed activation energies for circular samples as a function of in plane diameter . </S>",
    "<S> the activation energy continues to increase as the diameter increases . as a result circular samples become more thermally stable for increasing size .    </S>",
    "<S> activation energy for square samples ( blue / dark ) and circular samples ( red / light ) . </S>",
    "<S> inset : energy barriers for a square of side 100 nm for different values of @xmath11 , the points are obtained with the string method and the line obeys eq.([eq : analyticbarrier ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> , width=288 ]    we tested the validity of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : analyticbarrier ] ) by varying the value of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the results are represented on the inset of fig.[fig : squaresizedependence ] . </S>",
    "<S> there is a clearly increasing and nearly linear behavior , as predicted by the analytical expression .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we used the string method to determine activation energies for thermally induced magnetization reversal and compared the results to a macrospin model . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that finite size effects on the macrospin model are important even for very thin samples . </S>",
    "<S> the energy barrier of the macrospin model can be calculated more accurately and at no additional computational cost by using the full demagnetization tensor . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the activation energy for square samples as a function of size displays a transition from linear dependence to a constant value at a critical size . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that for circularly samples the activation energy will continue to increase beyond a critical size , albeit more slowly . </S>",
    "<S> we have also provided an analytic estimate for the activation energy for nonuniform magnetization reversal in nanomagnets with perpendicular anisotropy , which can guide experiment and memory device development . </S>"
