    "the theory of quantum open systems has attracted growing attention because the framework of system plus environment has become a fundamental paradigm in quantum dissipative system , quantum optics and quantum information science @xcite . in reality",
    ", no quantum systems can be completely isolated from their environment .",
    "the mutual interaction between the system and environment is responsible for many important physical processes such as dissipation , fluctuation , as well as decoherence and disentanglement .",
    "quantum open system is also an essential part of quantum information processing where the quantum noise and control are major issues in realizing quantum computing , quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "while the theory of open systems in the markov regimes can be extensively treated with the standard lindblad master equations @xcite or the corresponding markov quantum trajectories @xcite , the microscopic non - markovian theory has not been well developed for the systems consisting of interacting spins , which are of experimental interest @xcite .",
    "the difficulty arising from the strong coupling between the system and its environment is that the non - markovian effects due to action and back reaction between the system and the environment must be taken into account . undoubtedly , some memory related properties such as quantum entanglement , inhibited spontaneous emission , quantum transport , quantum tunneling @xcite which are of importance will be lost when simply taking the markov limit . among all of the techniques",
    "attempt to investigate the non - markovian evolution , the quantum state diffusion ( qsd ) equation initially proposed by disi , gisin , and strunz @xcite provides a powerful tool to deal with the quantum open systems coupled to a boson bath @xcite .",
    "the recent developments of the non - markovian dynamics are concerned with a theoretical derivation of the qsd equation directly from an underlying microscopic model irrespective of environmental memory time and coupling strength @xcite .",
    "the non - markovian qsd equation is equivalent to the master equation formalism , but offers numerical advantages over the corresponding master equation if it exists .",
    "typical to non - markovian evolution is that the dynamics is explicitly dependent on the past history manifested in the integrals over the time in the dynamic equation @xcite . in the case of non - markovian qsd , under certain conditions ,",
    "the nonlocal integral can be cast into a time - local form @xcite .",
    "then , the time - local qsd equation can be efficiently implemented as an analytical and numerical tools to describe the non - markovian effects .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to study the non - markovian quantum dynamics of interacting qubits .",
    "we derive a closed exact time - local qsd equation for two interacting qubits coupled to a bosonic environment by replacing the functional derivative in the qsd equation with a time - dependent operator called @xmath0 operator .",
    "we have established the explicit equations of motion for the coefficient functions contained in the @xmath0 operator .",
    "the second purpose of this paper is to investigate the non - markovian dynamics of qubit systems by using the derived exact qsd equation .",
    "since the exact qsd equation is valid for an arbitrary structured boson bath and the strong coupling regime , we are thus able to address the important issue of entanglement generation via environment memory in the full non - markovian regime .",
    "it is shown that several interesting features may arise from this coupled qubit system when we examine the dynamics in a non - markovian regime . with this coupled qubit model ,",
    "we have studied the approximation based on the functional expansion of the @xmath0 operator , and reveal some interesting features on non - markovian perturbation theory .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce an interacting qubit model and develop the theory of the exact time - local quantum state diffusion equation . in sec .",
    "iii , based on the exact qsd equation derived , we consider memory - assisted entanglement to illustrate the implications of non - markovian dynamics on entanglement generation . as an example , we show that entanglement generation may be significantly modified by the environment memory time . with the quantum trajectories generated by the exact qsd equation",
    ", we also analyze the steady state solution for the single trajectories recovering the steady state entanglement described by the density matrix .",
    "we conclude in sec . iv .",
    "the model consists of a pair of coupled two - level atoms ( or spins ) interacting with a common bath .",
    "the total hamiltonian can be written as ( setting @xmath1 ) , @xmath2 where @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the system lindblad operator coupled to the environment .",
    "note that @xmath5 are constants describing different coupling strengths for two spins .",
    "this type of interaction between qubits has been studied widely in the heisenberg spin chain models @xcite and proved to be a useful model in quantum information processing based on spin chain . moreover",
    ", some cavity - qed systems may be described by a similar type of hamiltonian in simulating the heisenberg spin chain @xcite .",
    "notably , our model in the framework of quantum open system is a very general case , including many other physically interesting models as special cases of this hamiltonian .",
    "for example , when @xmath6 , this model will reduce to the example of the heisenberg @xmath7 type interaction . when @xmath8 , two qubits will be treated as non - interacting spin .",
    "when @xmath9 this model simply reduces to the one qubit dissipative model @xcite .    the stochastic schrdinger equation for this interacting spin model may be formally written as @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the bath correlation function and @xmath12 is a complex gaussian process satisfying @xmath13=m[z_{t}z_{s}]=0 $ ] , and @xmath14=\\alpha(t , s)$ ] .",

    "let us emphasize that our results are valid for an arbitrary correlation functions . for simplicity , in this paper",
    ", we model the noise as an ornstein - uhlenbeck process for which the correlation function is @xmath40 .",
    "this correlation function is very useful in demonstrating the non - markovian effects as well as the markov case by varying the parameter @xmath41 , which controls the memory effect of the reservoir .",
    "when @xmath42 , @xmath43 it corresponds to the markov case .",
    "oppositely , when @xmath41  is small , the system is in a non - markovian regime .",
    "having developed the time - local non - markovian qsd equation for the two interacting qubits , this section is concerned with the non - markovian dynamics of entanglement involving entanglement generation and evolution @xcite . throughout the paper , the degree of entanglement is measured by `` concurrence '' @xcite .      with our exact non - markovian qsd equation ( [ nnmqsd ] ) , we are able to consider the important non - markovian feature of entanglement generation . for this purpose , we consider the separable state @xmath44 to show how the environmental memory affects the entanglement generation .",
    "it has been known that the entanglement may be generated for a qubit system through coupling qubits to a common bath .",
    "however , it is not clear how the environmental correlation times affects entanglement generation . in fig .",
    "[ noise1 ] , we plot the entanglement evolution for different parameters of @xmath45 where @xmath46 gives the memory time of the environment . with this initial state , we can see that when @xmath47 ( close to the markov limit for this model ) , there will be no visible entanglement generated for all times .",
    "in fact , it is easy to show that in the markov limit no entanglement will be generated ( i.e. @xmath48 ) for this special initial state . in addition",
    ", it is seen that when the parameter is too small , the entanglement generation becomes less significant shown in our numerical simulations .",
    "this shows that the non - markovian property affects generating entanglement in a subtle way .",
    "we can show that entanglement generation for this special initial state is due to the environmental memory rather than the spin - spin coupling .",
    "interestingly enough , we find that the largest amount of entanglement may be generated if the correlation time of environment is neither too long ( @xmath41 is small ) nor too short ( @xmath41 is large ) . in fig .",
    "[ noise2 ] , we plot the case without coupling between the two spins .",
    "the results confirm that entanglement for the two non - interacting qubits is purely generated by environment memory .",
    "our results here have clearly shown that non - markovian noise can be very useful rather than harmful to the entanglement if the memory times are properly chosen .",
    "quantum trajectories generated by the non - markovian qsd equation ( [ sse ] ) have many interesting properties .",
    "for instance , we can use those quantum trajectories to study the steady state entanglement . in fig .",
    "[ entgen ] , we plot the entanglement dynamics from a separable initial state @xmath49 .",
    "the numerical results show that the initial pure state evolves into a steady entangled state .",
    "in fact , with the help of non - markovian trajectories , we can show that all the trajectories will localize to the eigenstates of the lindblad operator @xmath50 and the residual entanglement of the steady state is not zero .",
    "now , let us examine the large @xmath51 behavior of the single trajectories .",
    "first , we choose the following four states@xmath52 which form a complete basis of the hilbert space .",
    "hence , an arbitrary state can always be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54    substituting eq .",
    "( [ expand psi ] ) into the qsd eq .",
    "( [ tlsse ] ) , we get the following stochastic differential equations for the coefficients : @xmath55 where @xmath56 . here",
    ", we assume that the two qubits are identical and symmetric ( @xmath57 ) for simplicity .",
    "the more general case can be dealt with in a similar way . for the initial state @xmath58 ,",
    "the initial conditions for this set of equations are @xmath59 for the above initial conditions , @xmath60 at any times , and the steady state solution for @xmath61 is simply given by @xmath62 thus , the large @xmath51 state for a single trajectory will not contain @xmath63 and @xmath64 components , i.e.@xmath65 now , it is clear that all trajectories will always evolve into a sub - space of the hilbert space spanned by @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which are the eigenstates of the lindblad operator @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , we can easily derive the equations of the motion for the ensemble means of the cross terms .",
    "for example , @xmath69 $ ] satisfies the following equation : @xmath70=(ij_{xy}+2ij_{z}-2i\\omega)m[c_{3}^{\\ast}c_{4}]-\\sqrt{2}m[z_{t}^{\\ast}c_{3}^{\\ast}c_{2}].\\ ] ] since @xmath71 in the long - time limit , we have @xmath72\\rightarrow0,\\,\\,m[c_{3}^{\\ast}c_{4}]\\rightarrow0.\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is large .",

    "@xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 . the steady state density matrix in the basis @xmath79",

    "[ single ] ( a ) , we plot the fluctuation of the system lindblad operator @xmath50 defined as @xmath86 . it is shown that , as time evolves , the fluctuation of @xmath50  converge to zero in the final steady state for all trajectories . in fig .",
    "[ single ] ( b ) , we plot the sum of the probabilities of @xmath66 and @xmath67 for a few trajectories .",
    "the sum of the probability @xmath87 will always evolve to @xmath88 for any single trajectories which means @xmath89 and @xmath90 are always zero in the final steady state . the numerical results in fig .",
    "[ single ] simply show that the final state of single trajectories take the form of eq .",
    "( [ psi_f ] ) as predicted by analytical analysis .",
    "in addition , our numerical results show that the final density matrix is approximately given by @xmath91{cccc}0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0.25 & -0.25 & 0\\\\ 0 & -0.25 & 0.25 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0.5 \\end{array } \\right ]   .",
    "\\label{app_rho}\\ ] ] which is also consistent with our prediction in eq .",
    "( [ rho_f ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that such a steady state has be shown to be the stationary solution of the markov master equation @xcite . in our qsd method , it is showed that this state is also the stationary solution of the non - markovian quantum trajectories",
    ". therefore , the ensemble mean of the quantum trajectories recovers the non - markovian steady state of the density matrix .",
    "it is important to note that our non - markovian theory does not depend on the existence of the non - markovian master equation .",
    "finally , we present the time evolution of the purity , defined as @xmath92 , which determines whether the quantum state is pure or mixed . specifically , we find the purity of the initial state @xmath93 which evolves into a steady state with some residue entanglement preserved in the final steady state . in fig .",
    "[ purity ] , it is validated that the final steady state is a mixed entangled state since the purity is smaller than one at the steady state .",
    "the purity is approximately @xmath94 in long time limit , which is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ app_rho ] ) .",
    "for all the other three initial states , we will see two qubits will firstly evolve into a mixed ( perhaps entangled ) state by the coupling interaction , then decay into the final ground state @xmath95 ( which is a pure state ) due to the dissipative environment .",
    "for the coupled two - qubit model , the exact @xmath0 operator contains five terms , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ ansztz of o ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the perturbative qsd equations based on the exact expression of the @xmath0 operator .",
    "for example , we may drop the first order noise - dependent term @xmath96 and only keep the first four terms , i.e. the @xmath0 operator in eq .",
    "( [ ansztz of o ] ) is approximately written as @xmath97 clearly , the first order term @xmath96 becomes less important when the system is close to the markov regimes .",
    "also , numerical calculations will be greatly simplified if the first order noise is neglected . in fig .",
    "[ o5 ] , we have compared the exact time evolution of entanglement and the approximate case without @xmath96 .",
    "the numerical result shows that the accuracy of the zeroth order approximation is sensitively dependent on the initial state of the qubits . for the anti - correlated initial states , fig .",
    "[ o5 ] ( a ) and ( d ) shows that the approximation is extremely good compared with the exact result . on the other hand , for the correlated initial states in case ( b ) and ( c )",
    ", the noise dependent term tends to smooth out the entanglement curve .",
    "in fact , this can be explained by analyzing the qsd eq .",
    "( [ c1]-[c4 ] ) . if the initial states do not contain @xmath98 component , i.e. @xmath99 , then @xmath100 is always zero during the time evolution .",
    "the fifth term of the @xmath0 operator @xmath101 will not affect the dynamics of the system , since the coefficient of @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath102 , is always associated with @xmath100 .",
    "this observation explains our results plotted in fig .",
    "6 . as shown in fig .",
    "6 , the noiseless approximation ( setting @xmath103 ) gives extremely good results for the two initial states which do not contain @xmath104 component .",
    "our simple analysis here has already shown the complexity level of the approximate qsd equations arising from the noise expansion of the @xmath0 operator .",
    "more in - depth study on the approximate qsd equations will be presented elsewhere .",
    "in conclusion , the central aim of this paper is to develop a time - local theory of non - markovian quantum state diffusion for a model consisting of two interacting qubits  a model that is of interest for both quantum information processing and quantum optics .",
    "as an application , we used the non - markovian quantum trajectory to analyze the entanglement evolution of the qubit system for several parameters ranging from strongly non - markovian to markov regimes .",
