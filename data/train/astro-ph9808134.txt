    "although it is commonly believed that pulsars are born in the supernova explosions of massive stars , only about 2% of the presently observed population are considered to be associated with supernova remnants ( hereafter snrs ) .",
    "the standard explanation for this apparently low fraction of objects is a combination of the radio lifetimes of pulsars ( @xmath0 yr ) compared to snrs ( @xmath1 yr ) , the beaming fraction of radio pulsars and the fraction of all supernova that produce a neutron star . in order to decide whether an association is real or coincidental , a number of questions need to be considered ( see e.g. kaspi 1996 ) .",
    "these include positional coincidence , agreement of the distances and ages of both the pulsar and the snr and , if measured , the velocity vector of the pulsar should be consistent with its position offset from the center of the snr .",
    "agreement in age is of great importance , since the age of the pulsar should not much exceed @xmath2 years .",
    "the age of a pulsar can in principle be determined from its spin parameters .",
    "given an initial spin period @xmath3 and a magnetic field @xmath4 , the pulsar loses rotational energy , mainly through magnetic dipole radiation , but also through electromagnetic radiation and particle losses .",
    "the spin period @xmath5 therefore increases with time . as the temporal derivative of the period @xmath6",
    "can be measured with a high accuracy , the age of the pulsar can be determined if assumptions are made for @xmath3 and the braking behavior ( e.g. manchester & taylor 1977 ) .",
    "the equation of motion is described by the differential equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a constant .",
    "the braking index @xmath10 depends on the specific slow - down model . integrating this equation yields an expression for the age : @xmath11.\\ ] ]",
    "it is a standard practice to define the `` _ characteristic age _ ''",
    "@xmath12 , where @xmath3 is assumed to be 0 ( corresponding to @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( corresponding to the braking torque through pure dipole radiation ) @xmath15    in principle , @xmath10 can be calculated through measurement of @xmath16 . in practice",
    "this is difficult due to the presence of timing noise and glitch activity for young pulsars .",
    "nevertheless @xmath16 has been determined for four pulsars so far and varies between n=1.4 for the vela pulsar and 2.8 for psr b1509 - 58 ( manchester et al .",
    "1985 , lyne et al .",
    "1988 , manchester & peterson 1989 , lyne et al .",
    "1996 ) . as can be seen in eq .",
    "( 2 ) this span already implies an uncertainty of a factor of about 4.5 for @xmath17 .",
    "all values are smaller than @xmath14 which leads to a systematic underestimation by the characteristic age .",
    "this underestimation is important for long - period pulsars with @xmath18 .",
    "estimates for @xmath3 on the other hand are mainly based on theoretical models .",
    "an exception is the crab pulsar where the age is precisely known through chinese records .",
    "the corresponding supernova explosion occurred in 1054 a.d .. using eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the initial period of this pulsar can therefore be calculated as @xmath19 . in the literature , estimates for the initial period of pulsars are found between virtually zero and about @xmath20 ( e.g. lyne et al .",
    "1985 , narayan & ostriker 1990 and lorimer et al . 1993 )",
    ". therefore for short period pulsars , @xmath3 could well be of the order of the present period .",
    "therefore the characteristic age could easily _ overestimate _ the real age of these pulsars by more than an order of magnitude ( kaspi et al .",
    "the examples of pulsar polarimetry in fig . 1 show that basically all states of polarization can be found .",
    "one question is , if the degree of polarization ( hereafter @xmath21 ) , which is defined as the polarized fraction of the total intensity , depends on any pulsar parameter at all . although it was known that young pulsars often have highly polarized profiles ( e.g. manchester 1996 ) , no significant correlations could be found so far . as demonstrated by von hoensbroech et al .",
    "( 1998a ) this is mainly due to the fact that earlier investigations had been made at `` classical '' pulsar frequencies between 400 mhz and 1400 mhz . at frequencies higher than a few ghz",
    "clear correlations become obvious between @xmath21 and the loss of rotational energy @xmath22 , respectively the surface accelerating potential .    at 4.9 ghz ,",
    "for instance , pulsars with a high @xmath22 clearly have a higher @xmath21 than pulsars with a low @xmath22 ( for a possible physical explanation see von hoensbroech et al .",
    "as @xmath22 decreases with the characteristic age , @xmath21 also decreases ( see fig .",
    "the potentially large error of the characteristic age induces a strong scatter in the horizontal direction of fig .",
    "2 , making the correlation less significant than it is with @xmath22 . but",
    "one clear conclusion can be drawn from this plot : young pulsars are higher polarized than old ones at 4.9 ghz .",
    "using this fact , we use the polarization of the 4.9 ghz radio profiles to identify sources with a relatively high characteristic age , which are possibly younger than they seem .",
