    "the first gamma - ray burst ( grb ) ever discovered was in the year 1967 ( klebesadel et al .",

    "2004 ) after 2005 january .",
    "although the grb population with redshift is rather small , studies dedicated to the hosting galaxies are often deep and can cover the wavelength range from the radio , to mid - ir , to optical , and uv in imaging and spectroscopy ( e.g. , bloom et al .  2002 ; le floch et al .",

    "the typical nature of grb hosts is of a faint star - forming galaxy , dominated by a young stellar population ( christensen et al .",
    "2004 ) , detected at any redshift from 0 to 6.3 ( berger et al .",
    "luminosities are generally low ( chary et al .  2002 ; le floch et al .",

    "new cosmological simulations suggest that hosts associated with long grbs are representative of the whole galaxy population ( nuza et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "many hosts are fainter than the observational limits achieved today by the typical galaxy survey at high redshift ( see for instance cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ; abraham et al .  2004 ; reddy et al .  2006 ; noeske et al .",
    "in fact , the bright optical grb afterglow often facilitates obtaining a spectroscopic redshift and the mere presence of a grb encourages deeper photometric and spectroscopic observing campaigns than in conventional galaxy surveys .",
    "it is not clear yet whether this faint population is stand - alone and characterized by the association with a grb event ( stanek et al .",
    "2006 ; fruchter et al .",
    "2006 ) , or whether we see many faint galaxies simply because these are the most common galaxies in the universe .",
    "wolf & podsiadlowski ( 2007 ) showed that there is no dramatic difference between grb hosts and what is expected for a galaxy population tracing star formation .",
    "this paper is dedicated to the study of the largest possible sample of grb host galaxies . in the past , many different tools applied to individual or a few grb hosts led to very heterogeneous results , not always easy to compare .",
    "we used a compilation of grb hosts to measure a large number of galaxy parameters in a robust and consistent way , and try to establish the role of grb hosts in the cosmological scenario of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the sample is selected by requiring that optical and/or near - ir ( nir ) photometry ( available in the literature ) have allowed the host identification . for a better stellar mass estimate ,",

    "we distinguish between the subsamples of galaxies originating in short grbs , which are associated with neutron star / black hole mergers possibly in evolved stellar populations , or long grbs , associated with core - collapsed sne and more abundant in young stellar populations ( woosley 1993 ) .",
    "it has been argued by different authors that the hosts of the two classes are substantially different , the former in early- as well as late - type galaxies , the latter mainly in young star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , prochaska et al .",
    "2006 ; berger et al .",
    "long grb hosts are the vast majority ( seven out of eight ) , as the long duration allows an easier identification of the afterglow , whereas the detection of short afterglows is very recent ( gehrels et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "our group created a public database , where many grb - host observed parameters , available from the literature , are classified and stored .",
    "the database , the largest of its kind , is called grb host studies ( ghosts ) and is accessible at the web site www.grbhosts.info .",
    "ghosts is an interactive tool offering many features .",

    "are also included in our analysis ( le floch et al .",

    "the galactic color excess @xmath14 for each object ( table  [ tsample ] ) is estimated using the reddening maps by schlegel et al .",

    "we compare observed parameters , with the same parameters measured in field galaxies , observed at different redshifts .",
    "in particular , we use results from the @xmath15 gemini deep deep survey ( gdds ; abraham et al .",
    "2004 ) , the lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ; erb et al .  2006 ; reddy et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the local dwarf galaxies ( lee et al .  2006 ) .",
    "the gdds is an ultra - deep nir - selected survey ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) targeting galaxies in the `` redshift desert '' ( @xmath18 ) .",

    "measurements from gdds and the grb hosts are treated in the same way , in particular in the modeling analysis we use the initial mass function ( imf ) proposed by baldry & glazebrook ( 2003 ) . a correction for the different imfs ,",
    "generally salpeter is assumed , is necessary for the other samples .",
    "the grb - host sample studied here contains 46  objects ( 30% of all grbs with measured redshift ) .",
    "six of these are associated with short grbs , all at redshift @xmath28 , with a mean redshift @xmath29(table  [ tsample ] ) .",
    "the mean and median redshift of the long - grb sample is @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , with 88% being at @xmath32 , when the universe was 4 gyr old ( i.e. , 29% of the age today ) .",
    "we note that the grb hosts that are considered have relatively low redshift , in comparison with the mean and median values for the total grb population with known redshift ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively ) .",
    "this is because grb hosts are faint and hard to detect for @xmath35 , and also because redshifts in the pre - swift era were mainly determined from strong optical emission lines , redshifted in the more difficult nir regime for @xmath36 .",
    "most grbs ( @xmath37% ) in our sample belong to the pre - swift era .",
    "this can potentially bias the results that we discuss in this paper .",
    "for instance , grbs are associated with regions of star formation .",
    "as the star formation rate ( sfr ) density in the universe is a strong function of the galaxy stellar mass ( juneau et al .",
    "2005 ) , it might be that grb hosts at low and high redshifts are associated with less- and more - massive galaxies , respectively .    from the multiband photometry , we derive a ` pseudophotometry ' to create a homogeneous sample , as described in  [ phot ] ( table  [ tcol ] ) .",
    "thirty - three out of 46  hosts have detected optical emission lines , indicating ongoing star formation ( table  [ temi ] ) .",
    "this is partly an observational bias , as the redshift of a grb is often determined from the emission lines in the host .",
    "the bluest of these lines is the [ oii ] at @xmath38  .",
    "as many hosts are spectroscopically observed in the optical , the highest redshift of the sample is marked by the [ oii]@xmath39 line , at @xmath40 ( figure  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "details are given in ",

    "the photometry of the sample is mainly covering the observed optical ( including the @xmath41 band ) and nir bands . for a subsample , mid - ir detections or upper limits",
    "are also available ( le floch et al .",
    "2006 ; berger et al .",
    "2007b ) . only grb hosts detected in at least two bands are included in the sample , the reddest of which has to be above the 4000  break .",
    "this means mainly @xmath42 hosts , the only exception being the host of grb  050904 at @xmath43 , for which only optical and mid - ir upper limits are available ( berger et al .",
    "the total number of grbs with @xmath42 is 109 , two - fifths of which are in our sample .",
    "the rest were not considered , because optical - nir photometry is not available , either because observations were never attempted or not deep enough .",
    "the detection of the host above the 4000  break is necessary to determine one of the galaxy key parameters , the total stellar mass .",
    "parameters derived from only uv photometry are very uncertain , because the mass - to - light ratio in the uv can vary by a very large factor in young stellar populations and due to the presence of dust .",
    "the main difficulty of dealing with the photometric sample of grb hosts is that it is very heterogeneous and sparse .",
    "for instance the data taken by different groups are treating galactic dust extinction or aperture corrections in different ways .",
    "moreover , heterogeneous filters are often used . in a few cases the grb host",
    "is observed in the same band with different telescopes , and results differ by more than the observational uncertainties .    to reduce the confusion , from the observed multiband photometry we have derived a  pseudophotometry \" , which is a homogeneous photometry for a reduced set of filters .",
    "magnitudes for the pseudophotometry in the ab system , corrected for galactic extinction , are reported in table  [ tcol ] .",
    "the principle of  pseudophotometry \" is to first define a large set of commonly used filters including sdss , hubble space telescope ( hst ) , bessel , johnson , and irac filters .",
    "then , we reduce this set of filters to the filters which are necessary to represent all the photometric points involved in the available grb - host observations . to do so",
    ", we use a criterion @xmath44 , or maximum wavelength difference of 300   at 5000  : the effective wavelengths @xmath45 of the filters involved in the real photometry must be close enough to one of the effective wavelengths @xmath46 included in the reduced set of filters . we thereby build a small set of 16 filters , ranging from @xmath41 band to irac 8@xmath26 m band , which we use in practice for our spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting . all the grb - host seds are therefore described with this set of filters .",
    "the effect of using the reduced set of filters instead of the exact bibliographic filters is small for our study : the offset in effective wavelengths is typically less than 200  . for each grb host , we checked with monte carlo simulations that random shifts of this order on the filters wavelengths produce small errors on the mass estimates .",
    "we note that not all observed magnitudes are in table  [ tcol ] . for more details on the observed photometry , see the ghosts database .",
    "the @xmath47 and @xmath48 magnitudes for the sample are shown in figure  [ mag ] .",
    "the comparison with the gdds @xmath49 galaxies shows that grb hosts are generally faint galaxies , with about half being fainter than @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "all short - grb hosts are at @xmath28 .",
    "this could be a selection effect , as short afterglows are harder to detect than long afterglows ( gehrels et al .",
    "2005 ) . in figure",
    "[ col ] , we show the apparent colors of the sample .",
    "the comparison with a complete sample of gdds galaxies , and the predicted colors assuming different stellar populations ( e / s0 , sbc , irregulars , and starbursts ) , indicates that grb hosts are generally blue star - forming galaxies ( see also berger et al .",
    "the short - grb hosts are still too few to conclude anything about their stellar population from their colors",
    ".      fluxes of optical emission lines from [ oii]@xmath39 to the [ sii]@xmath52 doublet , originating in the star - forming ( or hii ) regions are measured for a subsample of 33  grb hosts and corrected for galactic extinction ( table  [ temi ] ) .",
    "errors are reported when available .",
    "the [ oii ] and h@xmath53 lines are detected up to @xmath54 and @xmath55 , in 31 and 11 hosts , respectively .",
    "h@xmath56 and [ oiii]@xmath57",
    "are both detected in 19 hosts . the [ neiii]@xmath58 line is present in 13 hosts ; the [ neiii]-to-[oii ] flux ratio is @xmath59 in six hosts .",
    "such relatively strong values indicate high temperature or high ionization , which is expected in the presence of hot massive stars .",
    "strong [ neiii ] is common in hii regions and blue compact dwarf galaxies ( stasiska 2006 ) .",
    "contamination from active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is unlikely , as seen from emission - line ratios ( section 5.6 ) .",
    "the true emission - line fluxes can be several times higher than those measured .",
    "some corrections are necessary in order to have a better estimate of the total sfr , metallicity , and dust extinction in the hosts .",
    "the slit - aperture flux loss is determined for each host individually .",
    "it depends on the size of the host with respect to the slit aperture used and the seeing conditions during observations .",
    "the aperture correction is reported in the last column of table  [ temi ] , but it is not applied for the fluxes given in this table .",
    "this is the factor we have to multiply the observed flux to obtain a more realistic total flux .",
    "it is ` 1 ' ( no correction necessary , almost half of the hosts ) either when it is negligible , or it is already applied by authors of the papers from where fluxes are taken , or the redshift is high enough ( galaxies get smaller ) for the given slit ( generally 1 arcsec ) . in all other cases",
    "it is @xmath60 and derived by us , mainly comparing the observed multiband photometry with the flux - calibrated host spectrum , or it is estimated by considering the galaxy size in comparison with the slit aperture used and the seeing condition during observations .",
    "one arcsec corresponds to a physical size from redshift @xmath54 to @xmath61 ( the highest and lowest redshift in the sample ) of 8.4 to 1.9 kpc , respectively .",
    "the aperture correction is @xmath60 and @xmath62 for eight hosts . for the remaining 5 ,",
    "it is @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "of course our aperture correction is not perfect , but it is the best that can be done , given the inhomogeneity of the sample .",
    "dust extinction in the host ( see  [ dust ] for details ) is determined from the balmer decrement for the subsample with simultaneous h@xmath56 and h@xmath53 detection ( 10 grb hosts , table  [ tbal ] ) , and is calculated assuming a gas temperature @xmath65 k. the dust extinction is not applied for fluxes in table  [ temi ] , but is applied when estimating sfrs .",
    "the stellar absorption correction , generally more important in evolved stellar populations , is estimated only for the balmer lines , as it is typically negligible for the metal lines . in local irregular and spiral galaxies ,",
    "the typical stellar balmer absorption equivalent width ( ew ) is 3  , with 2   uncertainty ( kobulnicky , kennicutt , & pizagno 1999 ) .",
    "it is lower in extragalactic hii regions , ew@xmath66   ( mccall et al .  1985 ) .",
    "to estimate the stellar balmer absorption , we inspected the observed host spectrum . in some cases",
    "it is clearly negligible ( e.g. , the emission - line flux is high with respect to the stellar continuum ) and no correction is applied . in all other cases",
    "it is generally estimated by adding 2   to the measured , rest - frame equivalent width of the lines . in one case ( the host of grb  060505 ) , the stellar correction is the one estimated by thne et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .    in table",
    "[ tbal ] , we list the intrinsic - to - observed flux ratios ( after and before stellar absorption correction ) for balmer emission lines . for h@xmath53 ,",
    "the correction is up to 13% of the observed emission flux ( mean value 4% ) . for h@xmath56 and h@xmath67",
    "it is clearly higher , up to 30% and 56% ( mean 10% and 25% ) , respectively ( table  [ tbal ] ) . the stellar absorption correction , although generally not very important , was never applied before in grb - host studies . for the remaining of the paper",
    ", we will use emission fluxes corrected for stellar absorption and aperture - slit loss unless otherwise stated .",
    "the stellar properties of grb hosts in the sample have been studied using the observed multiband photometry . following the procedure of glazebrook et al . ( 2004 ) , we model the stellar population using pgase.2 ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ; 1999 ) and pgase - hr ( le borgne et al .  2004 ) . in order to avoid distorted mass - to - light ratios from young burst components superimposed on older stars ,",
    "we represent the stellar population by two components , with sfr @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is time and @xmath70 is the @xmath71-folding time .",
    "the first component is one of 10 alternate seds , each characterized by a different discrete value of @xmath70 ( from starburst to constant sfr ) , covering a range of star formation histories ( sfhs ) .",
    "the primary stellar component is coupled with a secondary component representing a star - bursting episode , with @xmath72 gyr , and a total stellar mass in the range 1/10,000 up to two times the mass of the primary component .",
    "the age of the stellar population is also constrained by the age of the universe at the observed galaxy redshift .",
    "the attenuation of the stellar emission , due to dust , is a free parameter and can vary in the range @xmath73 ( the calzetti law is used ) .",
    "the same for the metallicity , in the range @xmath74 .",
    "the modeling also includes an emission - line nebulosity component which we include as it can have small effects on the photometry near bright lines .",
    "we use the standard pgase prescription for this and note that this is only used in the sed modeling and not in the interpretation of real galaxy emission - line spectra .",
    "the imf used to estimate stellar masses is that which is derived by baldry & glazebrook ( 2003 ) .",
    "this more realistic imf gives a total stellar mass which is generally 1.8 and 1.3 times lower than that derived by using salpeter ( 1955 ) and kroupa ( 2001 ) imf , respectively .",
    "the full distribution function of allowed masses was calculated by monte carlo resampling the photometric errors .",
    "the monte carlo error approach is to : ( 1 ) apply a scaled poisson error distribution of the fluxes and flux - errors ( this is superior to using a gaussian distribution as fluxes come from photon counting detectors ) ; ( 2 ) create a new sed by flux and poisson realization ( flux - error ) and re - fit the masses ; ( 3 ) iterate @xmath75 times to make a distribution .",
    "the resulting mass distribution then samples the range of sfhs consistent with the error distribution of the photometry .",
    "the final masses and errors are the mean and standard deviation of the monte carlo mass distribution .",
    "our code is more general than most in the literature because we include a secondary burst component .",
    "this is advantageous as it allows for possible mass biases associated with young bursts superimposed on old stellar populations to be explored ( by turning off the burst term ) . in general",
    "we find that masses are robust to turning on / off bursts , and varying metallicities and dust , and are good to the @xmath76 @xmath77 level",
    ". with this code then the mass of grb hosts with poor photometry ( e.g. , few data points or photometry not sampling redder rest frame wavelengths ) is poorly constrained , and this is reflected correctly as large error bars in table  [ tsed ] .",
    "the requirement that one or more photometric detections above the 4000  balmer break is known , and that at least two photometric bands are used , provides a reasonably robust total stellar mass determination . at @xmath784000 , the seds are far less affected by younger stellar populations and uncertain dust modeling .",
    "figure  [ fsed1 ] shows the best fit to the observed sed .",
    "the stellar mass - to - light ratio in the @xmath20 band @xmath79 and the stellar mass for each grb host are listed in table  [ tsed ] , together with the absolute @xmath20 and @xmath80 magnitudes .",
    "the age of the last episode of star formation , the metallicity , the sfr and dust extinction in the stellar component are also calculated .",
    "however , these parameters are more uncertain due to the well - known degeneracy , according to which the colors of metal - rich stellar populations are indistinguishable from those of old or dusty stellar populations ( worthey 1994 ) .",
    "our method is more general than previous work which make assumptions which speed up the calculation ( for example by assuming a single simple sfh or a single metallicity ) .",
    "in contrast with the method adopted by christensen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , our metallicity is given by the best fit , and not assumed to be solar .",
    "moreover , christensen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) assume a single episode of star formation and do not derive the total stellar mass .      for the stellar mass fitting ,",

    "the rest - frame @xmath20-band luminosity is generally well correlated with the galaxy stellar mass .",

    "( 2008 ) , who considered sn  ic hosts and found that sn  ic occur in an environment similar to that of grbs . indeed , some nearby grbs are associated with sn  ic , a subclass of core - collpase supernovae ( galama et al .",

    "; hjorth et al .  2003 ; modjaz et al .  2006 ) .",
    "the connection between grb events and the nature of their hosts is advocated by modjaz et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who found that five grb hosts are significantly more metal poor than sample of sn  ic hosts in a similar luminosity range in the @xmath80 band .",
    "however , sn discoveries are observationally biased toward luminous ( and hence on average more metal rich ) galaxies .",
    "the result of modjaz et al .",
    "( 2008 ) is affected by the small number statistics .",
    "prieto et al .  ( 2008 ) found in a statistically significant sample a much larger metallicity spread , and a significant mass  metallicity relation which would include grb hosts .",
    "moreover , one should consider that the @xmath80-band absolute luminosity in galaxies is weakly correlated with mass .",
    "the @xmath20-band luminosity would instead better represent the galaxy stellar mass ( figure  [ mk ] ) , and this would better support the special nature of grb hosts .",
    "wolf & podsiadlowski ( 2007 ) quantitatively showed that any grb rate dependence on galaxy mass ( or ultimately metallicity ) is at best small .",
    "to better understand the impact of grb hosts on our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution , we have analyzed the properties of the largest possible sample , 46  grb hosts , using multiband photometry and optical spectroscopy .",
    "relevant parameters are summarized in table  [ tsummary ] .",
    "the median redshift , @xmath20-band absolute magnitude , stellar mass , dust extinction , metallicity , sfr , and ssfr are reported at the bottom of the table .",
    "the ultimate goal is to understand whether grb hosts are special galaxies , related to the occurrence of a grb event , or just normal galaxies , but small and metal poor because these are the most common galaxies in the universe . due to the large redshift interval spanned by the sample , @xmath0",
    ", different populations likely coexist .",
    "the one at low redshift is different from that at high redshift because of the intrinsic evolution of galaxies with time , and because of the redshift dependence of the selection effects .    from the colors of the sample , we confirm that grb hosts tend to be blue galaxies",
    ". the best - fit sed can constrain the fraction of stars involved in the burst phase , which in our sample is generally less than 10% of the total mass . a reliable estimate of the @xmath20-band absolute magnitudes",
    "is provided . due to observational limits , at high redshift",
    "only bright galaxies are detected .",
    "grb hosts below @xmath165 have @xmath166 .",
    "most galaxies ( 83% ) have stellar masses in the range @xmath167 m@xmath4 to @xmath168 m@xmath4 .",
    "the stellar mass completeness limit of the typical present - day high - redshift galaxy survey is higher than @xmath168 m@xmath4 . for @xmath84 m@xmath4 ,",
    "the grb - host sample is highly incomplete .",
    "for the six short - grb hosts the median stellar mass is @xmath169 m@xmath4 , indicating that the association of short grbs with elliptical more - massive galaxies needs a larger sample to be proven .",
    "we provide a relation between stellar mass and absolute magnitude @xmath20 ( eq .",
    "[ emk_m ] ) , which is based on the finding of a nearly constant stellar mass - to - light ratio in the @xmath20 band , of the order of @xmath170 @xmath171 .",
    "the sfrs derived from emission lines , after dust - extinction , aperture - slit loss , and stellar balmer absorption correction , are the best approximation to the true total sfr .",
    "when emission lines are not measured , we propose an sfr relation which uses the uv luminosity at 2800  .",
    "sfrs in the total sample span three and a half orders of magnitudes ( sfr @xmath172 m@xmath4 yr@xmath7 ) .",
    "two out of six short - grb hosts have high sfrs , more than 10 m@xmath4 yr@xmath7 .",
    "the sfr normalized by the stellar mass ssfr , or its inverse , the growth timescale @xmath121 indicate that grb hosts are active and young systems , which is expected given the generally low mass of the hosts , the high redshifts , and the fact that redshifts are often found trough the detection of emission lines .",
    "berger et al .  ( 2003 ) and le floch et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have claimed much higher sfrs , based on radio and mid - ir detections .",
    "the host of grb  980613 looks involved into a merger of several subcomponents ( hjorth et al .",
    "2002 ; djorgovski et al .",
    "our sfr estimate refers to component a that hosted the grb .",
    "the high sfr derived by le floch et al .",
    "( 2006 ) refers to component d , which is more than 30 kpc away from component a. regarding grb  980703 and grb  000418 , le floch et al .",
    "( 2006 ) commented that agn contamination would explain the high radio emission and no spitzer detection .",
    "however , the existence of two grb hosts with agn on a relatively small sample observed in the radio is hard to explain ( michaowski et al .",
    "if the radio is associated with sf , then the nondetection in the mid - ir would imply a strong absorption by the silicates around 10 @xmath26 m ( e. le floch , 2008 , private communication ) .",
    "the blue optical colors for some of the grb hosts can be explained if large regions of these galaxies are totally obscured by dust .",
    "optical light might be dominated by relatively less obscured stars outside star - forming regions , leading to blue colors ( michaowski et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "we further investigate the relation between grb hosts and other galaxies , by analyzing the mass - metallicity ( @xmath173 ) relation .",
    "this is the correlation between the stellar mass of galaxies and their metallicity ( lequeux et al .",
    "1979 ; tremonti et al .",
    "2004 ; savaglio et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the @xmath173 plot of figure  [ mz ]",
    ", we compare grb hosts with local dwarf galaxies ( lee et al .",
    "2006 ) , and gdds and cfrs galaxies at @xmath153 ( savaglio et al .",
    "the local sample metallicities are estimated using the @xmath130 method . since the @xmath130 or o3n2 metallicities are not measured for gdds galaxies and grb hosts , proper conversions are applied , as explained in   [ metallicities ] .",
    "in the left and right panels of figure  [ mz ] , we show the lower and the upper branch solution for metallicity in a subsample of 9 grb hosts .",
    "the picture is not very clear , and we do not detect a @xmath173 relation in the grb hosts of any kind , especially because for 9 hosts the metallicity is poorly constrained .",
    "however , we can say that there is no indication that grb hosts have metallicity lower than expected , given their stellar mass ( stanek et al .",
    "grb hosts are not a special class of galaxies . given the redshift and the stellar mass , the lower branch metallicity is favored for the 9 grb hosts with double solution ( right hand side of figure  [ mz ] ) ,",
    "as regards the redshift evolution , we compare grb host metallicities , with the metallicities measured in 11 damped lyman-@xmath53 systems through afterglow spectroscopy ( grb - dlas ; savaglio 2006 ) at redshift @xmath35 ( figure  [ zz ] ) .",
    "again , the situation is not very clear .",
    "grb - dlas indicate that metallicities of the order of half solar are expected at @xmath141 .",
    "this is actually observed in the subsample of 6 grb hosts whose metallicity ( determined with the @xmath130 or o3n2 calibration ) is better constrained .",
    "however , for the rest of the sample , the lower branch solution suggests no redshift evolution in @xmath0 , an interval of more than 13 gyr .",
    "any conclusion needs more and deeper observations , to break the degeneracy in those objects already observed , or to study new objects .",
    "for instance , the o3n2 calibrator can be detected using nir spectroscopy for the brightest objects at @xmath174 .",
    "the typical grb host is a small star - forming galaxy with likely sub - solar metallicity , but a non - negligible dust extinction ( table  [ tsummary ] ) .",
    "it is in some regards similar to a young lmc , observed at redshift @xmath175 , when it was more active than now , with an sfr which is 5 times higher than today .",
    "we still do not know whether hosts associated with short grbs are considerably different from those associated with long grbs .",
    "we have presented a complete study of the largest sample of galaxies hosting grbs , 46  objects , distributed along the redshift interval @xmath0 .",
    "grb hosts can be used as important probes of the cosmic history of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "most grbs are associated with the death of young massive stars , which are more common in star - forming galaxies .",
    "therefore , grbs are an effective tool to detect star - forming galaxies . as shown by recent studies ( glazebrook et al .  2004 ; juneau et al .  2005 ; borch et al .",
    "2006 ) , the star - formation density in the @xmath141 universe is carried out by small , faint , low - mass star - forming galaxies , similar to the typical grb host . moreover , in the @xmath176 universe , grb hosts observed with spitzer are @xmath177 times fainter than the typical spectroscopically confirmed galaxy in the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; yan et al .",
    "2006 ) , suggesting that not all star - forming galaxies at these redshifts are detected in deep surveys ( chary , berger & cowie ( 2007 ; yksel et al .",
    "we consider however , that our view of grb hosts is still partial , as we mainly detect those at @xmath178 .",
    "hosts at higher redshift are harder to observe .",
    "it is possible that high-@xmath23 grb hosts are more massive than those at low redshift , because star formation could be carried by more - massive galaxies in the remote universe .",
    "future deeper multiband observations of high-@xmath23 hosts are mandatory to help solve this issue .",
    "* grb hosts are generally small star - forming galaxies .",
    "the mean stellar mass is similar to the stellar mass of the lmc , @xmath179 m@xmath4 .",
    "about 83% of the sample has stellar mass in the interval @xmath180 m@xmath4 ) .",
    "the median sfr @xmath181 m@xmath4 yr@xmath7 is 5 times higher than in the lmc ; * to estimate sfr , we derived new relations , suitable for grb hosts .",
    "these give the total sfr when h@xmath53 is not detected , but [ oii ] or uv are detected .",
    "our sfrs span an interval of more than three orders of magnitudes , from 0.01 m@xmath4 yr@xmath7 to 36 m@xmath4 yr@xmath7 ; * the dust extinction in the visual band is on average @xmath90 .",
    "the balmer stellar absorption is generally small , but not negligible .",
    "dust extinction , balmer absorption and slit - aperture flux loss are considered when measuring sfr ; * the median star - formation rate per unit stellar mass ssfr is @xmath182 gyr@xmath7 , with a small scatter , such that sfr @xmath183 , a somewhat surprising result .",
    "the median ssfr is about 5 times higher than in the lmc .",
    "a large fraction of grb hosts are the equivalent of local starbursts ; * metallicities derived from emission lines in the host galaxies at @xmath141 are relatively low , likely in the range 1/10 solar to solar ; * metallicities measured from uv absorption lines in the cold medium of grb hosts at @xmath35 ( grb - dlas ) are in a similar range . combining this with the results for @xmath141 grb hosts ,",
    "we see no significant evolution of metallicity in grb hosts in the interval @xmath184 ; * the subsample of 6 short - grb hosts have stellar masses @xmath185 m@xmath186 m@xmath4 and ssfrs in the range @xmath187 gyr@xmath7 .",
    "the suggestion that short - grb hosts are large quiescent galaxies requires a larger sample to be confirmed ; * there is no clear indication that grb host galaxies belong to a special population .",
    "their properties are those expected for normal star - forming galaxies , from the local to the most distant universe .",
    "our investigation will continue , and results will be made public in the ghosts public database . in the final sample ,",
    "we plan to include all grb hosts detected with swift , for a total of a few hundred objects .",
