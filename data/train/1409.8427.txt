    "metal clusters containing two different elements , known as bimetallic nanoalloys , attract much attention due to their specific properties and rich diversity of structures , which suggests possible applications in electronics , engineering , and catalysis.@xcite core - shell nanoalloys are especially interesting due to their chemical and physical properties that depend on the size and structure of the cluster as a whole , as well as the structure of the core and shell , and their interface in particular.@xcite magnetic core - shell nanoclusters are of great importance because of the possibility of fine - tuning their properties to meet the needs of , for example , biotechnology applications.@xcite in particular , magnetic nanoparticles have been suggested to be used in magnetic bio - separation,@xcite molecular imaging,@xcite or as bio - sensors.@xcite    ni - based clusters are very promising in this respect , as such compounds are known to exhibit interesting magnetic properties in combination with other metals , such as , for example , au,@xcite pd,@xcite fe,@xcite cu and co.@xcite very attractive in this respect seem to be bimetallic clusters of ni with al and ag.@xcite indeed , structure , as well as electronic , and magnetic properties of small ni ",
    "al@xcite and ni ",
    "ag@xcite nanoalloys have recently been extensively investigated .",
    "a crucial issue for the potential real life applications of such binary clusters is their stability ( as well as the stability of their properties ) towards changes in external conditions , especially temperature .",
    "for this reason , the study of thermal stability and phase transitions is important for design of novel nanoparticles with engineered properties.@xcite the thermal stability of individual ni  al@xcite and ni ",
    "ag@xcite nanoalloy clusters has been theoretically investigated over the last decade .",
    "another important aspect of cluster studies in terms of practical applications is to move from isolated individual clusters towards the properties of such clusters in a non - trivial environment , i.e.under the influence of other bonding partners , which renders the clusters an integral part of new engineered materials .",
    "experimentally this can be realised through deposition of pre - formed clusters on extended surfaces,@xcite building of cluster - assembled materials,@xcite encapsulating clusters into metal - organic frameworks ( mofs),@xcite or even in more exotic ways , such as the recently reported deposition of core - shell clusters on the surface of silica microspheres.@xcite    despite the wealth of experimental and theoretical studies outlined above , to the best of our knowledge no systematic study of the intriguing magnetic properties of intermediate - size ni - based binary clusters and their thermal stability has been performed so far .",
    "furthermore , neither the interplay between electronic structure and thermal properties of these nanoalloys , nor the applicability of such bimetallic clusters as building blocks to create engineered materials has been thoroughly investigated . of course ,",
    "such task ideally calls for multiscale modelling,@xcite both in terms of the timescales of appropriate computational methods , and the spatial description of a system .",
    "all these open questions motivate the present study on the geometrical and electronic structure , and thermal properties of intermediate - size ni ",
    "al and ni  ag binary nanoalloy clusters , which follows the following logic .",
    "first , we perform global geometry optimization of a range of intermediate - size bimetallic clusters to establish their ground - state structures . for this",
    "we employ empirical potentials ( ep ) followed by density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "we then run molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations to find the melting temperature of each cluster and to generate a pool of geometries characteristic of a given cluster at a given temperature . for the obtained cluster configurations we analyse the electronic structure of the cluster configurations obtained both at the ground state and at higher temperatures at the dft level of theory to elucidate the nature of chemical bonding within such core - shell clusters , and to see whether these nanoalloys exhibit magnetic properties , suitable for practical applications . here",
    "we also analyse the difference in electronic interaction between the different shell elements ( al or ag ) and the potentially magnetic ni core .",
    "finally , we consider the feasibility of creating ordered arrays of such clusters on a suitable support by adsorbing them on the si(111)(7@xmath67 ) surface .",
    "to make sure that geometries of all individual clusters under consideration indeed represent their ground - state structures , we relied on basin - hopping ( bh ) based global geometry optimization @xcite using an empirical potential , followed by the local reoptimization of the obtained structures with dft .",
    "all sampling calculations have been carried out with the ` gmin ` package@xcite using the gupta potential,@xcite which has been proved successful for describing both geometrical structure@xcite and thermal behaviour@xcite of metallic and bimetallic clusters of various compositions , including ni ",
    "al@xcite and ni ",

    "the values used in this study were taken from ref .",

    "reoptimization of these structures , and subsequent electronic structure analysis was carried out with the plane - wave dft package ` castep`.@xcite electronic exchange and correlation was treated within the generalized - gradient approximation functional due to perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe).@xcite for comparison single - point calculations at the optimized pbe geometries were also performed at the hybrid functional level using the pbe0 @xcite functional ; we note that these calculations did not change any of the conclusions derived and presented below on the basis of the pbe data .",
    "the core electrons were described by using ultrasoft pseudopotentials , whereas the valence electrons were treated with a plane - wave basis set with a cut - off energy of 300ev .",
    "local structure optimization is done using the broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno method @xcite relaxing all force components to smaller than @xmath19ev /  .",
    "all molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have been carried out using the ` dl_poly ` package.@xcite all cluster systems have been simulated for 500ns at temperature intervals of 50k , each time starting from the global minimum .",
    "additionally , 50ns was used for equilibration .",
    "the gupta potential@xcite was used to model the interactions between atoms .",
    "the velocity verlet algorithm@xcite was used to integrate the equations of motion in the nvt ensemble .",
    "the length of time step was chosen as 1fs .",
    "the nos - hoover thermostat@xcite with relaxation time of 0.01ps was used to conserve the temperature . for an efficient sampling of phase space",
    ", we applied the replica exchange@xcite algorithm .",
    "swaps between adjacent temperatures were attempted every 10ns , with the exchange probability given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are potential energies and temperatures of two adjacent replicas , respectively , and @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the final heat capacity curves were obtained by applying the weighted histogram analysis method ( wham)@xcite to the replica exchange data as formulated in ref .. wham allows the computation of expectation values of an observable at any temperature of interest , if the average of the observable over all configurations with a given potential energy is known : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the average of an observable @xmath12 over all configurations with potential energy @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the potential energy density of states , and @xmath30 is the inverse temperature ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the solid - liquid phase transition can be clearly identified by an abrupt peak in the heat capacity curve . in the canonical ensemble ,",
    "the constant - volume heat capacity @xmath32 is related to the potential energy fluctuations as follows , according to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem : @xmath33 where @xmath28 is the potential energy , and @xmath34 is the number of atoms .",
    "for the present study we have chosen nine ni@xmath35al@xmath36 clusters , corresponding to particularly stable configurations of the intermediate - size ni  al nanoalloys ( cf.fig.[fig1 ] ) : ni@xmath37al@xmath38 , ni@xmath39al@xmath40 , ni@xmath41al@xmath42 , ni@xmath3al@xmath4 , ni@xmath38al@xmath43 , ni@xmath38al@xmath44 , ni@xmath1al@xmath45 , ni@xmath46al@xmath47 , and ni@xmath48al@xmath49 . for the details on the procedure of assessing relative stabilities of the clusters please refer to supplemental material.@xcite    the identified ground - state structures ( cf.fig.[fig2 ] ) have also been reoptimized at the dft level .",
    "these final geometries agree well with the ones obtained with the gupta potential , except for two structures ( ni@xmath3al@xmath4 and ni@xmath38al@xmath43 ) , which are somewhat distorted in their ground states .",
    "interestingly , the symmetry of the dft optimized structure depends on the spin state .",
    "thus , ni@xmath3al@xmath4 posesses a geometry of a very high @xmath50 point group symmetry when in a sextet spin state , while the doublet state has only @xmath51 symmetry .",
    "however , it is the doublet geometry that corresponds to the ground state , being 1.08ev more stable than its perfectly symmetrical sextet counterpart . a very similar picture is also observed in the case of ni@xmath38al@xmath43 : here , the ground - state doublet structure symmetry is completely broken ( @xmath52 ) , while the 2.15ev less stable sextet is a perfectly symmetrical icosahedron ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "these results indicate strong interactions between the ni and al electronic levels , which prevent the system from preserving a high spin ferromagnetic alignment of the @xmath54-electrons in the ni core , and thus lead to the distortion of the structure .",
    "the large impact of this effect on the geometry of the cluster is illustrated by the rather large energy differences between the structures .",
    "the origin of this coupling between geometry and electronic spin state is discussed in more detail below .",
    "the heat capacity curves for all nine considered clusters are summarized in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "these heat capacity data were used to find the melting temperatures of the considered clusters .",
    "spin states of the ni@xmath35al@xmath36 clusters in their ground states and at their corresponding melting temperatures ( main peaks ) are summarized in table[table_2 ] . to find",
    "the spin states at high temperatures , the electronic structure of the most abundant configuration was computed at dft level .",
    "thus , these spin states can be referred to as typical spin states of the cluster at a given temperature .",
    ".melting temperatures and spin states of the ni@xmath35al@xmath36 clusters . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as can be seen from the table[table_2 ] , high spin states are only observed for ni@xmath38al@xmath44 and ni@xmath1al@xmath45 . at high temperatures ,",
    "when distortion of the cluster structures is significant , the spin state is quenched in all cases .",
    "this can be rationalised in terms of hybridization between the electronic levels of ni and al . in fig.[fig4 ] we can see the density of states ( dos ) diagram , where both levels of ni and al take part in forming the frontier electronic levels of ni@xmath38al@xmath44 . as can be clearly seen from the 3d plots of the spin density distribution ( see inset in fig.[fig4 ] ) , shell al atoms also take part in accommodation of unpaired electrons , not only core ni atoms .    for the case of ni@xmath1al@xmath45 both the dos diagram and the spin density distribution",
    "look rather similar to the ni@xmath38al@xmath44 cluster ( for the details on the electronic structure of the ni@xmath1al@xmath45 cluster please refer to supplemental material@xcite ) , with the hybridization between ni and al being even more pronounced .",
    "interestingly , in both cases , the spin density is distributed over the al atoms corresponding to the apices of the @xmath55 and @xmath56 polyhedra of ni@xmath1al@xmath45 and ni@xmath38al@xmath44 , respectively .",
    "similar redistribution of electronic density might be responsible for geometrical distortion of the ni@xmath3al@xmath4 and ni@xmath38al@xmath43 clusters predicted by dft as opposed to symmetrical gupta structures , discussed above .",
    "overall , strongly hybridized states render conservation of high magnetic moments of ni core impossible , although clusters with unpaired electrons situated at the surface atoms ( i.e. potentially unsaturated bonds ) , such as in case of ni@xmath38al@xmath44 and ni@xmath1al@xmath45 , might be of interest for catalytic applications , as activation of clusters for catalysis is typically caused by coordinative ( and , subsequently , electronic ) unsaturation.@xcite      as we have seen with the example of ni ",
    "al binary nanoclusters , spin states of such systems are in most cases quenched due to rather strong hybridization between the electronic states of ni and al .",
    "is it possible to overcome this problem by choosing another shell metal ?",
    "since small ni ",
    "ag nanoalloys have been reported to exhibit high spin states,@xcite we decided to investigate such clusters . among the most stable ni@xmath35ag@xmath36 clusters ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] ) we have started from those having a potentially stable high spin core ( fig.[fig6 ] ) .    intriguingly , three of our selected clusters , ni@xmath3ag@xmath4 , ni@xmath1ag@xmath2 , and ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 , exhibit very high spin states of octet , nonet and septet , respectively , with the spin density distributed exclusively among the ni atoms .",
    "even more striking is the fact that these high spin states are conserved at much higher temperatures , even up to 1000k for the case of ni@xmath3ag@xmath4 . in the cases of ni@xmath3ag@xmath4 and ni@xmath1ag@xmath2 ,",
    "the configuration of the core remains virtually intact .",
    "for ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 , there is a structural transition whereby the core adopts an icosahedral - like structure at high temperature , and the whole ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 cluster is like a capped version of the smaller ni@xmath1ag@xmath2 cluster .",
    "we will further discuss this interesting result later .",
    "the most massive nickel core in the largest selected cluster ( ni@xmath57ag@xmath47 ) does not yield a high spin state .",
    "analysis of the electronic structure ( fig.[fig7 ] ) shows a clear separation of electronic states of ni and ag atoms , e.g. in the case of ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 . if we compare this diagram to the dos of ni@xmath38al@xmath44 ( fig.[fig4 ] )",
    ", there is a striking difference in distribution of shell and core electrons .",
    "the circled region corresponds to the location of the cluster s frontier orbitals .",
    "clearly , in the case of ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 cluster , the ni and ag states are rather well separated .",
    "the heat capacity curves for ni ",
    "ag clusters are rather similar to those of ni ",
    "al ( cf.fig.[fig8 ] and fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "if we compare ni@xmath35ag@xmath36 clusters to their al - based counterparts , we can see that the melting peaks are generally shifted towards higher temperatures in the case of ag - based clusters .",
    "the most interesting @xmath32 curve belongs to the ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 cluster , which undergoes a transition to a structure like that of ni@xmath1ag@xmath2 at high temperatures .",
    "there are two distinctive peaks at 740k and 1065k for the ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 cluster . at @xmath58750k reconfiguration of",
    "the core takes place from a hexagonal prism geometry to an icosahedron .",
    "such a configuration is similar to the previously identified ground state of ni@xmath1ag@xmath2 .",
    "for instance , one can clearly see the group of six `` extra '' ag atoms that are expelled from the main cluster structure and onto the surface during the transition . at around 1000k",
    "the overall cage - like shape of the cluster is destroyed .",
    "the position of the second peak ( 1065k ) agrees well with the melting curve of ni@xmath1ag@xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , the core of the structure at 750k with a highly symmetric @xmath59 configuration still possesses a high spin septet state .    to rationalize such a reconfiguration of the ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 cage into a ni@xmath1ag@xmath2-like cage at higher temperatures , we computed the geometric mean vibrational frequencies of two configurations of the ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 cluster .",
    "here , lower geometric mean vibrational frequency of the high temperature structure ( @xmath60@xmath61 ) compared to the global minimum structure ( @xmath62@xmath61 ) indicates the higher vibrational entropy , and hence increasing stability of the former structure as the temperature is increased .",
    "see supplemental material@xcite for a discussion of the full vibrational density of states for both structures .    the remarkable stability of the highly symmetrical magnetic ( having nonet spin state in its ground state ) ni@xmath1 cluster has been reported in the literature previously.@xcite the important result here , however , is the fact that ni@xmath1 core surrounded by ag shell atoms exhibits high magnetic moments in both hexagonal prism and icosahedron configurations , allowing the conservation of the septet spin state in ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 over a wide range of temperatures .",
    "thus , our results illustrate that , due to weak hybridization , ni ",
    "ag clusters of certain size exhibit high spin ground states , and are also able to preserve these spin states to higher temperatures . is it thus plausible to suggest the potential applicability of such highly magnetic clusters as building blocks to create magnetic materials ?",
    "the first obvious choice of how to realise such materials is to deposit pre - formed clusters on extended surfaces .",
    "quite an extensive body of literature is devoted to adsorbed nanoparticles , most of which has been done in the context of catalysis.@xcite for instance , adsorption of bimetallic clusters on graphene,@xcite sio@xmath39,@xcite mgo,@xcite tio@xmath39,@xcite and al@xmath39o@xmath63@xcite has been studied recently . the possibility of conserving and even increasing the high spin states upon adsorption was theoretically predicted for small pd,@xcite fe,@xcite and rh@xcite clusters .    for the purpose of creating a structured array of adsorbed clusters ,",
    "a suitable surface should : ( i ) be not very reactive towards our clusters ( in order not to destroy their properties ) , and ( ii ) provide a certain template for adsorption , so that the clusters stay apart and do not aggregate .",
    "for example , the si(111)(7@xmath67 ) reconstructed surface@xcite might be suitable for this purpose , as most of the si bonds are saturated there ( but not all , thus allowing the possibility of moderately strong binding ) , and it has two distinctively different halves of the unit cell .",
    "if our clusters can predominantly be adsorbed on one of those , it will prevent them from aggregating .",
    "thus , we ran pbe dft local geometry optimization of a cluster adsorbed on either the faulted half of the unit cell ( fhuc ) or the unfaulted half of the unit cell ( uhuc ) to check whether the cluster gets destroyed upon landing , and whether the two halves of the surface unit cell act differently .",
    "as potential adsorbates , we chose to investigate the ni@xmath1ag@xmath2 and ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 clusters .",
    "the ni@xmath1ag@xmath2 cluster turned out to be too stable individually , and it showed no tendency to adsorb .",
    "ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 , on the other hand , allows for a certain rearrangement of electronic density between the cluster and the surface , which leads to adsorption energies of up to 13.38ev per cluster adsorbed on the unfaulted half of the si(111)(7@xmath67 ) unit cell ( here positive adsorption energy indicates the energy gained upon adsorption , i.e.the total energy of the adsorbed aggregate is lower than the sum of the total energies of individual components ) . as can be seen from the fig.[fig9 ] ,",
    "six unsaturated si atoms ( three adatoms and three rest atoms ) interact with the adsorbed cluster . taking into account the previously reported binding energy of @xmath64ev for a single ag atom deposited on the si(111)(7@xmath67 ) surface,@xcite the observed adsorption strength of our cluster can be characterized as moderate .    in the case of adsorption on either half of the unit cell , the adsorbed ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 cluster preserves its structural integrity , but there is a 2.47ev difference in binding energy between the two adsorption sites in favour of the uhuc .",
    "this result might seem surprising , as most indivudual metal atoms prefer the fhuc over the uhuc,@xcite which was experimentally attributed to higher electron density ( brighter scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) images@xcite ) in the fhuc , and theoretically explained by the stability of metal atoms in the electrostatic wells produced by charge redistribution between si adatoms and si rest atoms.@xcite however , in a cluster as large as ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 , surface shell atoms are already involved in sufficiently strong chemical bonding , which makes them in a sense `` less metallic '' . in a similar way ,",
    "for instance , zn atoms with a fully filled @xmath54 level adsorb equally on the fhuc and uhuc by forming zn@xmath63 on the three center si adatoms in each half unit cell.@xcite in our case , adsorption on the fhuc leads to slightly larger distortions of the cluster , which turned out to be energetically less favourable .",
    "if we take a look at the spin density distribution in the adsorbed cluster system ( fig.[fig9 ] ) , the spin density isosurface plot reveals that most of the unpaired electrons are still situated at the ni core of the cluster .",
    "the total spin density situated at core ni atoms integrate up to 8@xmath0 , which is higher than the 6@xmath0 in the individual ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 cluster .",
    "such enhancement in spin states has been observed before in case of magnetic cluster adsorption,@xcite and has been explained by charge transfer from the cluster to the surface.@xcite a similar effect is also observed in our case . to illustrate this charge transfer , fig.[fig10 ] depicts the total electron density difference between the adsorbed cluster system and its components ( i.e.bare surface and bare cluster ) : @xmath65 .",
    "here , one can clearly see redistribution of the total electron density towards the surface ( see blue areas in fig.[fig10 ] ) .",
    "partial redistribution of the electron density indicates a certain level of interaction between the cluster and the surface , which helps to stabilize the adsorbed structure .",
    "in contrast , the more stable icosahedral ni@xmath1ag@xmath2 does not form stable adsorbed aggregates , due to insufficient interaction with the surface .",
    "we do not expect , however , that such inability of the symmetrical ni@xmath1ag@xmath2 cluster to adsorb can compromise the stability of adsorbed ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 clusters at higher temperatures , despite the reconfiguration of the ni core for the individual ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 cluster at 750k discussed above .",
    "first , the already formed bonds between the cluster and the surface would introduce an additional energy barier for reconfiguration .",
    "secondly , the `` extra '' six silver atoms will have to either bind to the surface , or to adjacent shell atoms , either way contributing to the structure stability .",
    "however , the thermal behaviour of the assembled material is an important topic worthy of a separate investigation .",
    "intriguingly , uhuc adatoms take part in the spin density redistribution ( fig.[fig9 ] ) . taking into account the experimentally observed conductivity of the metallic dangling - bond states of adatoms on si(111)(7@xmath67 ) clean surface,@xcite",
    "this might potentially mediate interaction between adsorbed clusters , which might be used for e.g. ferromagnetic coupling of their unpaired electrons .",
    "this question , however , goes beyond the scope of the current work , and we leave it here as an intriguing possibility .",
    "interestingly , the ni@xmath38al@xmath44 cluster also preferentially adsorbs on the uhuc of the si(111)(7@xmath67 ) surface . with the spin density of the individual cluster partially redistributed to the cluster s surface atoms ,",
    "this leads us to suggest another potential use of such deposited clusters , namely as catalytic materials .",
    "thus , the different hybridization behaviour of al and ag shell atoms with ni core may be employed to create two different types of materials , i.e.either magnetic ( weak hybridization , conserved spin states of the magnetic ni core ) , or catalytic ( strong hybridization , activated unsaturated shell al atoms ) .",
    "in summary , we have systematically studied the possibility of conserving the high spin states of the magnetic ni core in ni - based bimetallic nanoalloys with al and ag as shell metals .",
    "dft - based electronic structure analysis revealed that ni ",
    "al bimetallic clusters are characterized by a strong hybridization between the electronic states of ni and al , which leads to quenching of the ni core magnetic moment in most cases . in the case of ni@xmath3al@xmath4 and ni@xmath38al@xmath43",
    "such hybridization leads to geometrical distortion of the high symmetry structures and complete quenching of the magnetic moment already in their ground states .",
    "this effect , apparently , is also responsible for the redistribution of the unpaired electrons , observed at the ground states of ni@xmath38al@xmath44 and ni@xmath1al@xmath45 , over the surrounding shell al atoms , which eventually leads to distortion of the clusters at higher temperatures .",
    "ni  ag nanoalloys , however , exhibit a completely different behaviour .",
    "ni@xmath3ag@xmath4 , ni@xmath1ag@xmath2 , and ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 not only are magnetic in their ground state ( octet , nonet , and septet , respectively ) , but also possess high spin states at higher temperatures : ni@xmath3ag@xmath4 retains a relatively high spin state of sextet at temperatures as high as 1000k , ni@xmath1ag@xmath2 is a nonet at 800k , and ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 is a septet at 750k .",
    "ni@xmath3ag@xmath4 and ni@xmath1ag@xmath2 clusters are able to mostly conserve their structural integrity at higher temperatures , whereas the ni@xmath1 core of ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 undergoes a transformation from a hexagonal prism to an icosahedral geometry at @xmath66k .",
    "furthermore , our calculations show the possibility of selective adsorption of such stable magnetic ni ",
    "ag clusters on the unfaulted half of the unit cell of the si(111)(7@xmath67 ) surface .",
    "for example , ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 prefers adsorption on the uhuc ( 2.47ev more stable than on the fhuc ) while preserving integrity upon deposition .",
    "even more interesting is the enhancement of the magnetic moment of the cluster up to 8@xmath0 upon adsorption , compared to 6@xmath0 in a gas phase .",
    "this offers the possibility of bringing the intriguing properties of such ni  ag bimetallic nanoalloys to real life applications via building novel materials with engineered properties .",
    "finally , different levels of interaction between ni core and al and ag shell atoms leads to possible applications that are different in their chemical nature : ni  al as catalytically active materials , and ni  ag as magnetic ones .",
    "this illustrates the diversity and flexibility available due to the tunable nature of the properties of bimetallic nanoalloys , as opposed to the more `` predictable '' monometallic clusters , which suggests their applicability in the area of nanotechnology .",
    "funding within the epsrc project `` : towards an understanding of catalysis on nanoalloys '' is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "dft calculations of the deposited clusters were carried out using the archer uk national supercomputing service ( www.archer.ac.uk ) .",
    "less time intensive calculations were carried out at local compute facilities of advanced research computing ( www.arc.ox.ac.uk ) , university of oxford .",
    "see supplemental material for further details on the procedure of assessing the relative stabilities of the clusters , detailed discussion of the electronic structure of ni@xmath1al@xmath45 cluster , as well as full analysis of the vibrational spectra of ni@xmath1ag@xmath5 at different temperatures ."
