    "galaxy clusters are formed hierarchically through the mergers of smaller clusters and groups .",
    "mergers of galaxy clusters are the most energetic events since the big bang , with a total kinetic energy that can reach 10@xmath4j ( e.g. @xcite ) , and major mergers close to the plane of the sky are very rare systems but of extreme importance in cosmology ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "most of the mass in galaxy clusters is dark matter , and the bulk of baryonic mass is in the form of ionized plasma , comprising about 15% of the total mass . during a merger ,",
    "as the plasma clouds of each cluster pass through each other they are affected by ram pressure , causing them to slow down .",
    "the galaxies in a cluster are effectively collisionless and are affected primarily by tidal interactions during the merger .",
    "dark matter does not have a large cross - section for self - interaction ( e.g. @xcite ) , so shortly after collision the plasma clouds are expected to lag behind the dark matter and the major concentrations of cluster galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a merger thus results in an offset between the dominant luminous component , imaged using x - ray telescopes , and the total mass , mapped using gravitational lensing .",
    "abell 2146 is in the throws of a major merger @xcite and x - ray maps show a structure similar to the  bullet cluster \" ( @xcite ) .",
    "unique among merger systems , two clear shock fronts are detected in the _ chandra _ x - ray temperature and density maps indicating mach numbers of @xmath32.3 for the bow shock and @xmath31.6 for the upstream shock , and corresponding velocities in the plane of the sky of 2700@xmath5 kms@xmath6 and @xmath7 kms@xmath6 respectively @xcite . from the shock velocity and the projected distance from the collision site , @xcite estimate that the merger is observed @xmath8 gyr after core passage .",
    "the detection of the shock fronts is fully consistent with the merger being observed soon after first core passage ( e.g. @xcite ) , but the timescale is approximate due to uncertainty in the velocity of the subcluster - likely to be significantly lower than the shock velocity ( e.g. @xcite ) - and since the location of the collision site is not precisely known .    in fig.1",
    "we show the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory image from @xcite and _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) optical colour composite of abell 2146 ( program 12871 , pi king ) . subclusters a and b are labeled on the left , with subcluster a being located at the head of the ` bullet ' in the south - east . the brightest cluster galaxy ( hereafter bcg ) of the se subcluster ( a2146-a ) ,",
    "is in an unexpected location lagging _ behind _ the x - ray cool core @xcite .",
    "as noted above , in the early stages of a cluster merger the galaxies should be nearly collisionless and follow the dark matter distribution , which should lead the collisional x - ray gas ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the strange projected location of the bcg in abell 2146-a , the system is unusual in that despite it appearing to undergo a major galaxy cluster merger it does not have a detected radio halo @xcite .",
    "studies of samples of radio halos in clusters have shown that they are found almost exclusively in morphologically disturbed clusters , indicating that their generation is associated with acceleration or re - acceleration of energetic particles in the highly shocked cluster gas , and that there is a relationship between the radio power of the halo , @xmath9 , and the x - ray luminosity of the cluster , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the conditions under which radio halos are generated in clusters , such as the cluster masses , velocities and timescales , are still open questions . merging clusters , such as abell 2146 , which do not exhibit these features may be a powerful diagnostic to test models of radio halo generation .",
    "in this paper we present multi - object spectroscopy of the system , in order to identify substructure and to provide a complementary method of probing the dynamical status , timescale of the merger , and mass of the system ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "section 2 will briefly describe the optical sample selection , and observations and data reduction will be the subject of section 3 .",
    "results from an analysis of the substructure within the abell 2146 system will be presented in section 4 and section 5 will discuss these results in the context of simple dynamical models .",
    "section 6 presents a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "a future paper will address the stellar populations of the system .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a @xmath11cdm cosmology with present day hubble parameter h@xmath12kms@xmath6mpc@xmath6 , matter density parameter @xmath13 , and dark energy density parameter @xmath14 ( we assume a cosmological constant , equation of state parameter @xmath15 ) . for this cosmology and at the redshift of abell 2146 ( @xmath1 ) ,",
    "an angular size of 1arcsec corresponds to a physical scale of @xmath16kpc .",
    "here we briefly present the criteria for selecting the galaxy sample for _ gemini _ gmos - n multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) observations of abell 2146 .",
    "the next section will outline the observations and data reduction .",
    "targets were detected on our rc band optical subaru imaging using sextractor @xcite .",
    "we restricted our target galaxies to those brighter than 21 apparent magnitude and to those within 3arcmin from the centre of the abell 2146 system .",
    "we then determined the cluster `` red - sequence '' by binning the galaxies into magnitude bins of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 mags .",
    "we fit two gaussians to the bimodal population of colour in each magnitude bin ; one defining the `` red sequence '' and one defining the  blue cloud \" , and took the @xmath21 boundaries of the gaussian defining the red sequence to determine its width in each magnitude bin .",
    "we then fit a linear relation to the red sequence ( black solid lines in fig .",
    "[ col_mag_image ] ) .",
    "we identify 337 targets with rc@xmath22 mags on the cluster red sequence ( see fig .",
    "2 , left ) .",
    "many galaxies morphologically associated with the x - ray shock fronts and one of the bcgs do not lie on the red sequence .",
    "for this reason we additionally add 50 targets to our target list ( including 12 acquisition targets ) based on an inspection of the _ subaru _ images . in particular",
    "we added the south - east bcg and targets close to the bcgs and x - ray shock front which were too blue to be included on the red sequence .",
    "we also added two possible strong lensing features to our target list .",
    "finally we have a sample of 375 target objects and a further 12 acquisition objects to input to the gemini mos mask preparation software ( gmmps ) .    the two bcgs ,",
    "galaxies close to the shock front and strong lensing features were assigned the highest priority .",
    "all other targets were prioritized by magnitude then cluster - centric distance and the gmmps was iteratively run in order to fit as many objects as possible on the masks while requiring at least 3 acquisition objects per mask .",
    "finally , we obtained 7 masks totaling spectra on 170 targets indicated by red points on the left hand panel of fig .",
    "2 . of the 170 targets observed with gemini 139 lie on the red - sequence giving a red sequence completeness of 67% at rc@xmath23 mags within 3 arcmin of the center of the abell 2146 system .",
    "as described in section 3 , we were able to obtain redshifts for 97 galaxies , of which 63 were determined to be cluster members and are tabulated in the appendix ( see appendix and section 4 ) .",
    "the 97 objects are indicated on the right panel of fig .",
    "2 with the cluster members in red .",
    "objects indicated by circles are those determined to be on the red sequence while those indicated by boxes are found blueward of the red sequence .",
    "spectroscopic observations of abell 2146 were carried out with the _ gemini _ multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) at the _ gemini north telescope _ on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "they were made over the course of four nights between 2012 april 19 and may 1 ( program i d : gn-2012a - q-47 , pi canning ) .",
    "we used the gmos - mos instrument equipped with the b600+_g5307 grating .",
    "this configuration yielded a dispersion of 0.50 / pixel .",
    "the 5.5arcmin field of view of the gmos detector allowed observations to be made in a single pointing .    using slit widths of 1arcsec and slit lengths of 5arcsec , between 18 - 31 objects were able to be targeted in each mask . due to the densely packed nature of the field",
    ", 7 masks were used to obtain spectra of a total of 170 science targets .",
    "three 1200 second exposures were taken with each mask in order to achieve a s / n@xmath24 per spectral pixel , at the redshift of the 4000 break for the faintest galaxies in our target list ( determined using gemini gmos exposure time calculator ) .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using helium - argon lamps .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the gemini package in iraf ; see fig.3 for examples of the resulting spectra .",
    "all science exposures , comparison lamps , and flats were overscan / bias subtracted and trimmed .",
    "the resulting reduced spectra were then processed to remove cosmic rays , wavelength calibrated , extracted to 1d and combined .",
    "the cross - correlation method was used to calculate radial velocities through the rvsao package in iraf .",
    "a catalogue of 23 different templates from the rvsao library @xcite , including stars , quasars , and emission and absorption line galaxy template spectra was used to determine the radial velocities . in order to determine the templates to use in the final analysis we relied on a combination of visual examination and the _",
    "r_-value returned by rvsao .",
    "each extracted 1d target spectrum was visually examined and a redshift identified by at least two members of the team , with a third examining spectra where disagreements were found . for 54/170 objects no redshift was able to be determined with a visual inspection due to a low s / n . for a further 19/170 targets the visual examinations yielded a redshift which was not consistent with the radial velocity measurements for any of the 23 rvsao template spectra . in both these cases",
    "the targets were not used in the remainder of the analysis in this paper . in 73/170 targets the visual examination yielded a redshift within @xmath25",
    "km  s@xmath6 of the rvsao radial velocity with the highest _ r_-value . in these cases",
    "the radial velocity corresponding to the highest _",
    "r_-value template was used . in the remainder ( 24/170 ) , the highest _",
    "r_-value template did not correspond to the visually determined @xmath26 .",
    "however , a template with _",
    "r_-value smaller than the best value did have a radial velocity within @xmath27  km  s@xmath6 of the visual velocity . if @xmath28 then we accepted the fit with a lower _ r _ after further examination of the template spectra .",
    "in most of these 24 targets poor sky subtraction was the reason for poor template fitting .",
    "however , the hst imaging has shown many lensed features are apparent in the abell 2146 system and galaxy density is high .",
    "some poor redshifts may be due to blending between two of more sources .",
    "the spectra of the bcgs in a2146-a and a2146-b are shown in fig.3 .    in order to minimize errors associated with cross - correlation and to correct for artifacts in the spectra ( such as cosmic rays ) , three separate observations of each object",
    "were made and then the spectra were co - added together ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this signal averaging helps to increase the signal to noise of the spectrum and can help to remove certain undesirable features that are only contained in one of the individual spectra . the radial velocities and errors",
    "were then compared to both the co - added and individual spectra .",
    "the target radial velocities were used to determine cluster membership : first , we made a @xmath29 kms@xmath6 cut at the previously calculated cluster redshift of @xmath30 @xcite , as was done by @xcite .",
    "cluster members were then determined by a 2.5@xmath31 clip of the remaining objects .",

    "we apply a lilliefors test to determine whether the velocity distribution of the 63 cluster member galaxies is statistically different from a gaussian distribution .",
    "we calculate a p - value of 0.23 indicating that the null hypothesis , that the velocity distribution of the system as a whole is gaussian distributed , can not be rejected .",
    "however , for a plane of sky merger this is not a sufficient condition to exclude the presence of subclustering .    to investigate the possibility of subclustering",
    "further we apply the dressler - schectman test @xcite ( henceforth ds test ) and also carry out an analysis of the 2d projected density of cluster members .",
    "first , we apply the ds test which provides a useful statistic to determine the likelihood of subclustering .",
    "the ds test compares the kinematics of a sample of size @xmath32 to the kinematics of the whole system .",

    "we found a @xmath40 .",
    "the marginal result makes it hard to determine if there is substructure in the system ( see also @xcite for the results of applying the ds test to simulated galaxy clusters ) .    to test",
    "if the calculated @xmath41 was significantly different from random , we randomly shuffled the velocities of the objects while holding the positions fixed . repeating this process 10,000 times",
    ", we found that the fraction of random velocities that gave a larger @xmath41 was @xmath42 , where a value of @xmath43 less than @xmath44 would be expected for a non - random distribution .",
    "thus , we conclude that the ds test results are not strong enough to indicate substructure in the system",
    ". we return to this result in the discussion .",
    "second , we analyse the 2d projected density of all of the cluster members .",
    "cluster members identified by their redshift were plotted in ra and dec space with overlaying contours determined using a kernel density estimator ( kde ) and a gaussian kernel .",
    "the kde utilized a silverman bandwidth . since",
    "gaussian kernels are less sensitive to bimodal distributions , this test will be biased towards strong substructure detections .",
    "the results plotted in fig.5 clearly show that two density peaks are present in the data .",
    "this confirms the existence of at least two subclusters and is consistent with the _ chandra _ x - ray data which shows a bi - model merger morphology with both forward and reverse shocks detected in the x - ray analysis and along the same axis as our two subcluster clumps @xcite .",
    "the kde analysis allows us to conclude that there is substructure present in the system .",
    "having confirmed the presence of substructure we wish to identify the cluster members of particular subclusters in order to characterise properties such as the mass of the substructures , the timescale since core passage of the merger and the presence of any offsets between the galaxy and hot gas populations . in order to assign the cluster members to particular subclusters",
    "we apply the kmm algorithm @xcite .",
    "this determines the mixture of multi - dimensional gaussians which are best fit to a set of data and the probability of each data point belonging to each gaussian .    the clear x - ray shock fronts and the small line - of - sight velocity offsets of the two bcgs indicates strongly that our merger is likely to be in the plane of the sky . as such",
    ", the distribution of velocities from each subcluster is expected to have a significant overlap ( as seen in fig.[red_dist ] ) .",
    "including such similar velocity information in the kmm algorithm can lead to non - physical results in distinguishing between the two subcluster components .",
    "the analysis was carried out with position data only and yielded results which correspond well with the projected galaxy density peaks seen in fig .",
    "[ density ] . the kmm algorithm classified 35 galaxies as belonging to a2146-a and 28 belonging to a2146-b .",
    "these subcluster members are marked in fig .",
    "[ density ] ( with blue corresponding to a2146-a and red corresponding to a2146-b ) , and subcluster membership is also noted in table 1 in the appendix .",
    "the velocity distribution of the galaxies identified in the two subclusters is shown in fig .",
    "[ red_dist ] .",
    "the kmm algorithm is sensitive to outliers @xcite which is of particular importance for a cluster sample such as ours where the data is incomplete .",
    "we therefore bootstrap the sample ( e.g. waters et al .",
    "2008 ) and re - run the kmm test 5,000 times to determine which galaxies to assign to which subcluster and the centroid of our two subclusters .",
    "the centroids and their 68 per cent uncertainties are 239.062@xmath45 , 66.349@xmath46 ( 15:56:14.9@xmath47 , 66:20:56.4@xmath48 ) and 239.005@xmath49 , 66.373@xmath46 ( 15:56:1.2@xmath50 , 66:22:22.8@xmath48 ) for subclusters a and b respectively .    applying a lilliefors test again to the individual subclusters yields a p - value of 0.83 for a2146-a and a p - value of 0.059 for a2146-b .",
    "this indicates that the velocity distribution for a2146-a can be adequately described by a gaussian distribution .",
    "a gaussian distribution for the velocities of subcluster a2146-b would be rejected at the 94 ( @xmath51 ) per cent level .",
    "there is evidence from a weak gravitational lensing mass reconstruction of _ hst _ data that a2146-b is rather more extended that a2146-a , possibly due to an intrinsically more elongated mass distribution ( king et al .",
    "the numbers of galaxies for which we have spectroscopic data is insufficient to decide between these possibilities .",
    "the biweight estimator @xcite was applied to the cluster members for location and scale giving a mean apparent cluster redshift of @xmath1 ( radial velocity of @xmath52kms@xmath6 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersions were calculated from the median absolute deviation ( mad ) ( e.g. @xcite ) with errors estimated through a bootstrap technique .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the two subclusters are @xmath53kms@xmath6 for the a2146-a subcluster and @xmath54 kms@xmath6 for the a2146-b subcluster , with a @xmath55 confidence interval ( ci ) .",
    "it is important to note that the distribution of radial velocities is under - sampled and given that a2146 has recently undergone a merger , the distributions are possibly non - gaussian .",
    "so the calculated velocity dispersions characterise the distribution , with the caveat that the sample may be non - gaussian .",
    "application of the biweight estimator and bootstrap error approximations were carried out using the astropy library in the python programming language . in a bootstrap technique",
    ", a @xmath55 ci is found for the mad .",
    "this approach draws many samples with replacement from the data available , estimates the mad from each sample , then rank orders the means to estimate the 16 and 84 percentile values for @xmath55 ci . unlike assuming normal distributions to calculate @xmath55 ci , the results calculated from the bootstrap are robust and can compensate for a data distribution that is far from normal .",
    "the velocity distribution of cluster members is shown in the histogram in fig.4 .",
    "the cluster members in a2146-a are shown in blue , and the cluster members in a2146-b are shown in red .",
    "gaussian profiles for each subcluster are overlaid and centered at the mean determined from a biweight estimator @xcite .",
    "a common way to estimate the mass of a galaxy cluster is through the virial theorem , which assumes dynamical stability ( e.g. @xcite ) , and therefore relates the time averaged kinetic energy to the potential energy as @xmath56 we calculate the virial masses below and tabulate them in table [ table : nonlin ] , along with the sz and x - ray derived masses from the literature ( see section 6 ) .",
    "however , we caution that the abell 2146 system is not dynamically relaxed and discuss the potential biases of the mass measurements in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the virial theorem relates the gravitational potential energy to the kinetic energy ( relative velocities ) of the cluster members and the mass is calculated via the following relation @xmath57 where @xmath34 is the velocity dispersion calculated in section [ velocity ] .",
    "@xmath58 is the mean harmonic radius given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the separation vector between the @xmath36 and @xmath61 galaxies and @xmath62 is the total number of objects .",
    "the benefit of using a mean harmonic radius is that it more accurately measures the effective radius of the gravitational potential of the cluster members @xcite , important when considering the virial state of a system .",
    "this radius also has the benefit of being independent of the cluster centre allowing it to reflect internal structure of the system , putting extra weight on objects that are closer together @xcite . the virial radius for the entire system is related to the mean harmonic radius by @xmath63mpc ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .    taking the values calculated for the velocity dispersions of each of the subclusters along with the harmonic radius for each , @xmath55 ci virial mass estimates",
    "are found to be @xmath64 m@xmath65 for a2146-a and @xmath66 m@xmath65 for a2146-b ( we note here that subcluster b was found not to be well described by a gaussian distribution ) , giving a mass ratio of 2.4 . as an estimate for the total mass ,",
    "we take the sum of the two estimates , since the assumption that the individual clusters are virialized is likely more appropriate than assuming that the system as a whole is virialized .",
    "this yields @xmath67m@xmath65 .",
    "note that the error bars do not reflect systematic errors which can change the mass estimate , even when the system is not in the throws of a merger ; this simple dynamical estimate assumes a virialized spherical mass distribution with isotropic velocity dispersion .",
    "the large errors in the mass estimates are due to the large errors inherent to the velocity dispersions .",
    "since the virial mass is proportional to the square of the velocity dispersion , the error on the mass estimates is quite large .",
    "the @xmath55 ci level corresponds to a @xmath68 uncertainty . for a discussion of the impact of systematic and model dependent errors on the mass estimates , see section [ discussion ] .",
    "since the estimates of mass from the kinematics of galaxies make several simplifying assumptions , we consider now an alternative estimate of the mass of each subcluster derived from a scaling relation between velocity dispersion and mass .",
    "@xcite used n - body simulations to obtain a prediction for the relationship between mass and velocity dispersion of dark matter halos .",
    "the advantage of this type of approach is that it includes more complex dynamical behaviour .",
    "although their simulations were carried out using only dark matter , since galaxies and dark matter particles can both be treated as collisionless particles moving in a cluster potential , they are expected to have approximately the same velocity dispersion ( @xcite ; see also discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "using the @xcite relation @xmath69 with the parameter @xmath70 at the cluster redshift and for the cosmology we work in , and determining the mass estimate for each cluster gives a total mass of @xmath71 .",
    "the observed non - gaussianity of a2146-b in conjunction with the system not being dynamically relaxed will contribute to an overestimation of the velocity dispersion for each subcluster component .",
    "the @xcite scaling relation does not account for these and therefore it is likely that the mass will be over estimated as well .    specifically for merging clusters , there have been studies using simulations to investigate the accuracy of various ways of estimating mass @xcite or focusing on specific merger systems ( e.g. @xcite ) . for clusters with a mass ratio of 3:1 , @xcite show that the mass inferred from a simple application of the virial theorem , and when sub - clustering is ignored in the analysis , can be biased by as high as a factor of two .",
    "the maximum bias arises when the clusters are merging with an axis along the line of sight , and is somewhat less in mergers with an axis close to the plane of the sky , though still up to a factor of 1.5 .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite are consistent with the earlier work of @xcite .",

    "[ two],scaledwidth=48.0% ]      we undertake a dynamical analysis of the system using a two - body model , making the assumption that our system consists of two dominant subclusters , which is reasonable based on the projected density map ( see fig.[density ] ) .",
    "we use the methods adopted by beers et al @xcite , to which the reader is referred for further details , and also follow the formalism presented in e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . taking the total mass of the system derived from the virial mass estimates and the difference in radial velocities of the two subclusters , we calculated the angle between the merger axis and the plane of the sky , and the age of the merger .",
    "note that this method assumes point masses on radial orbits with no net rotation .",
    "the subcluster halos will also most likely be overlapping in a recent merger . making these assumptions in this analysis",
    "will add systematic and model dependent uncertainties to the results obtained .",
    "therefore the solutions will be approximations to the dynamics of a2146 .",

    "the limits of the bound solutions can be found by considering the gravitational binding energy in the following relation @xmath87 where @xmath72 is the difference in radial velocities of the two subclusters and @xmath88 is the projected separation of the cores of the two subclusters .    since the velocity distributions of the subclusters , a2146-a and a2146-b , do not precisely follow a gaussian distribution , the difference in the mean radial velocity of the subclusters from a gaussian fit ( from fig .",
    "[ red_dist ] ) will not yield an accurate value of @xmath72 .",

    "while most of the absorption features are blended with emission features , making it difficult to accurately determine redshift , the na d ( rest wavelength of 5895  ) feature is relatively unblended and yields a velocity of @xmath9069,612 km s@xmath6 .",
    "this is a lower redshift than determined through cross correlation methods for the bcg which rely on the emission lines ( 69,897 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "@xcite show that much of the emission line gas in the a2146-a bcg is offset in a plume from the centre of the galaxy which may be the cause of the discrepancy in the radial velocities of the emission and absorption lines .",
    "calculating @xmath72 as the difference between the absorption line spectrum of a2146-b and the emission spectrum of a2146-a gives a value of @xmath91 kms@xmath6 .",
    "using instead the na d absorption feature yields a value of @xmath92 kms@xmath6 .",
    "nominally , it would be advantageous to take the velocities of the absorption lines of the galaxies , however , as the bcg in subcluster a is also offset from its predicted location - leading , rather than trailing , the cool core , which may indicate that the bcg is not in this case a good tracer of the center of the mass distribution - we opt to consider the uncertainty as the relatively broad range in velocities from the emission and absorption spectra .",
    "we therefore take @xmath72 to be in the range @xmath93kms@xmath6 to @xmath94kms@xmath6 in the two - body analysis .",
    "@xmath88 is taken as the projected separation of the two bcgs . at the cluster redshift",
    "this corresponds to 0.69 mpc .",
    "the radial velocity and projected radius are related to the system parameters as follows : @xmath95    solving equations [ it1 ] , [ it2 ] , and [ it3 ] iteratively yields the solutions shown in fig.6 .",
    "plotting @xmath72 shows the solutions for our system .",
    "while there are solutions of @xmath96 close to @xmath97 , the presence of the observed shocks in the x - ray analysis @xcite and the estimated value of @xmath98 @xcite , suggests that the merger is close to the plane of the sky .",
    "this allows us to take the range of solutions for @xmath99 to @xmath100 , which are very close to the values derived by @xcite .",
    "the results from the two - body model analysis are @xmath76kms@xmath6 for the relative velocity , and @xmath77mpc for the separation . assuming a collision site of @xmath101 , half way between the two subclusters , yields a merger age of @xmath102 gyr .",

    "[ zoom],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    x - ray observations of abell 2146 have revealed the system has two clear shock fronts and a gas structure similar to the bullet cluster @xcite showing it must be in the throes of a major merger .",
    "the detection of two clear shock fronts also indicate that the merger should be in an early stage .",
    "however , the abell 2146 system presents a couple of challenges to that hypothesis .",
    "the first is that the a2146-a subcluster bcg is located behind the bow shock and in the wake of the ram pressure stripped cool core rather than leading it ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . as mentioned in section [ intro ] shortly after a galaxy cluster collision the intra - cluster medium is expected to lag behind the bulk of the mass distribution traced by the dark matter and the major concentrations of cluster galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one possibility for the unusual location of the bcg could be that the cluster merger is not in its early stages ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in the later stages of a galaxy cluster merger the collisionless matter distributions slow due to gravity allowing the gas to catch up and be accelerated in a ` gravitational sling shot ' beyond the dominant mass distribution .",
    "other possibilities are that the system may not be adequately represented by a two - body collision with the cluster containing complex substructure , or that the merger is somewhat off - axis .    examining the redshifts of our target galaxies we find 63 galaxies are likely members of the a2146 system .",
    "an analysis of the projected density peaks of the galaxies ( see section [ subclustering ] ) shows that the abell 2146 system is dominated by two subclusters .",
    "our data do not provide evidence for other more complicated structures such as other merging groups or subclusters .",
    "we use the kmm algorithm to assign subcluster membership to the two subclusters and find 35 subcluster member galaxies in a2146-a and 28 in a2146-b .",
    "application of the ds test to determine substructure was inconclusive .",
    "however , we emphasise that in @xcite and in @xcite , the sensitivity of the ds test to substructure in merger systems is shown to be diminished when the subclusters are of similar mass and when their merger axis is close to the plane of the sky , as is likely the case in abell 2146 .    given that the system appears to be fairly well described by two dominant subclusters we undertake a simple two - body analysis of the subcluster velocities and positions ( section [ twobody ] and fig.[two ] ) to determine the properties of the merger . as the velocity distributions of the subclusters",
    "are not both well described by gaussian distributions we choose to use the bcgs as a tracer of the centre of the subcluster mass distributions .",
    "we note here that in the case of subcluster a2146-a this may be incorrect since , as mentioned above , the bcg is offset from the expected location of the centre of the mass distribution ; whilst the centroid of the distribution of red sequence galaxies is approximately coincident with the x - ray cool core , the bcg appears to lag behind the cool core . if a collision has offset the bcg we may therefore expect the bcg velocity not to accurately trace the subcluster velocity centroid .",
    "the a2146-a bcg not only shows absorption features but also strong emission features in the spectrum which have a velocity offset of @xmath90230 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "this is significantly larger than the errors in the velocities from cross - correlation ( @xmath9030 km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "the centroid of the subcluster velocity distribution falls in between the emission and absorption values ( a2146-a ; bcg emission 69,897 km s@xmath6 , bcg absorption 69,612 km s@xmath6 , centroid ( kmm ) 69,878 km s@xmath6 : a2146-b ; bcg absorption 68,827 km s@xmath6 , centroid ( kmm ) 69,710 km s@xmath6 ; wyffos spectra published in @xcite determined similar velocities of 69,753 and 68,940  km  s@xmath6 , from single gaussian fits to the emission and absorption spectra , for bcg a and b respectively ) .",
    "we therefore choose to use the full range of velocities from the absorption and emission lines in the a2146-a bcg in the two body analysis to allow a conservative estimate of the merger axis angle and timescale .    despite these uncertainties in cluster velocity centroid , the merger age , for bound solutions close to the plane of the sky ,",
    "is still predicted to be young ( 0.24@xmath1030.28gyr ) , similar to that determined for the bullet cluster @xcite .",
    "the subclusters are therefore likely being observed shortly after first core passage .",
    "the unusual bcg position is therefore unlikely to be due to a gravitational ` slingshot ' of the gas past the galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the merger axis is determined to be very close to the plane of the sky with @xmath99 to @xmath100 .",
    "the additional @xmath96 solution ( top of fig .",
    "[ two ] ) that would correspond to a line - of - sight merger is unlikely due to @xcite observing both forward and reverse x - ray shock fronts .",
    "observations of merger shocks are rare in x - ray observations as they are easily diluted by projection effects , they are therefore most prevalent in systems which are close to the plane of the sky .",
    "we therefore conclude that the unusual bcg location is not due to projection effects in a line - of - sight merger .",
    "these findings for the merger timescale and merger axis are also consistent with the presence of the two large shock fronts seen in _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observations @xcite , since later in the merger the shock fronts would not be visible , and for a larger angle with respect to the plane of the sky their sharp edges would be smeared by projection effects .",
    "although the two - body model is useful for estimating the dynamical history of merger systems , the assumptions that the clusters are point masses with constant mass over time , start to break down when they begin to merge .",
    "the analysis also does not include a change in relative velocity of the clusters with time . in the context of the bullet cluster",
    ", @xcite discusses several limitations of the two - bodel model , for example how dynamical friction and tidal stripping are not included in this type of analysis .",
    "both of these effects act to reduce the relative speeds of the cluster components .",
    "although hydrodynamic simulations are the most accurate way to model the dynamics of merger systems , there are prohibitive in terms of the complexity of setting up the simulations , and the computational expense .",
    "@xcite presents a novel approach where the computational requirements fall somewhere between the two - body model and hydrodynamic simulations . by comparison with full hydrodynamic simulations of the bullet cluster ,",
    "this method is accurate to about 10% in determining parameters describing the clusters and their merger trajectory .",
    "required inputs to this dynamical modeling approach include spectroscopic redshifts for cluster members , arising from this work , and additional mass estimates available from the weak lensing analysis ( king et al .",

    "however , the mechanisms which form this diffuse radio emission and the conditions required for their formation are not yet known .",
    "diffuse radio emission on mpc - scales in clusters requires local particle acceleration where either a pre - existing electron population is re - accelerated by merger turbulence ( e.g. @xcite ) or emitting electrons are continuously injected by collisions between cosmic ray protons and thermal protons ( e.g. @xcite ; for reviews of extended radio emission in clusters see @xcite )",
    ". the recent discovery of extremely steep radio halo spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) together with the non - detection of nearby clusters at @xmath108-ray wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ) favours turbulent re - acceleration models over the ` secondary ' continuous injection models .",

    "clusters with detected radio halos have @xmath9 correlated with @xmath10 and show a disturbed morphology consistent with merging where there is no radio halo detected , and with only upper limits on radio luminosity , the clusters generally appear more relaxed and lie roughly an order of magnitude below this correlation @xcite .",

    "@xcite showed the 3@xmath31 radio halo upper limit is a factor @xmath905 times lower than predicted given its x - ray luminosity .",
    "x - ray luminosity is boosted in a merger and this factor is greater for young mergers @xcite so the confirmed young age of the abell 2146 system ( being only @xmath110 gyr old ) and the near equal masses of the subclusters indicates its x - ray luminosity is likely to be enhanced by a factor of @xmath902 - 5 .",
    "a boost this significant could place abell 2146 back on the relation for merging clusters .",
    "however , the age since core passage is similar to other systems in which radio halos have been detected .",

    "the simulations of @xcite , albeit for a 1:7 mass ratio merger , suggest that the radio halo luminosity should be increasing rapidly during infall and through core passage , with the x - ray and radio luminosity , within a few hundred myr , being boosted by factors of 2 and 30 , respectively .",
    "they find the radio emission starts to decay roughly 0.5 gyr after core passage . while timescale may be relevant in boosting the x - ray luminosity and therefore in where abell 2146 should sit on the @xmath9-@xmath10 relation , these and other simulations suggest that the timescale since core passage for abell 2146 is not too short or too long for the generation of a radio halo .    cluster mass is thought to be a key component of radio halo generation in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite examine the radio - sz correlation for clusters on the basis that the integrated sz signal is a more robust indicator of the cluster mass regardless of dynamical state than the x - ray luminosity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a correlation is found for the radio power and integrated sz signal , @xmath111 for the sample of clusters and no bi - modality is detected between those clusters which are relaxed and those which are disturbed .",
    "the authors suggest the bi - modality with x - ray properties may be due to a bias in the radio quiet , x - ray selected clusters , being selected towards lower mass cool core clusters .",
    "however , they note that their sample size for radio quiet systems is small and so a weaker bi - modality might still exist .",
    "@xcite find the converse , that a bi - modailty exists , in both the @xmath9-@xmath10 and @xmath9-@xmath111 relations with all relaxed systems having radio halo upper limits which sit @xmath1122@xmath31 below the relation .",

    "while our individual subcluster masses similarly suffer from the dynamics of the merger the total mass as the sum of the subcluster masses rather than assuming one virialised system should yield value more in line with previous estimates .",
    "we therefore use a total mass of @xmath116 m@xmath65 giving a mass ratio of approximately 2.4:1 ( a2146-a to a2146-b ) .",
    "the large uncertainties in the mass estimates preclude determining which subcluster is in fact the more massive component with a high degree of confidence",
    ". however , the system appears to have undergone a recent relatively equal - mass merger .",
    "the x - ray analysis found that the bow shock and upstream shock are of comparable strength , which is consistent with a close to equal mass merger , however a 1:4 mass ratio with a2146-b being more massive than a2146-a was favored @xcite . for higher mass ratio systems , such as the bullet cluster @xcite with a ratio of @xmath310:1 ,",

    "assuming an nfw mass profile and a halo concentration of 4 typical of massive galaxy clusters ( see collation from king & mead 2011 ) , an estimate of @xmath119mpc was calculated , corresponding to @xmath120 m@xmath65 .    to take into account the overestimate in mass due to the system having undergone a recent merger , a surface pressure term ( spt ) can be subtracted from the viral mass to get a more accurate estimate of the true mass of the system @xcite .",
    "assuming the velocities are isotropic , the spt correction can be taken as @xmath121 @xcite .",

    "this is a factor of @xmath901.5 smaller than our dynamical virial mass estimate for the total system mass not including a spt correction , or roughly 1.2 times smaller with the spt correction , bringing the calculated @xmath127 within the errors of the sz mass estimate .",
