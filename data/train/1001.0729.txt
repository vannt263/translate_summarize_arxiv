    "exotic nuclei far from the @xmath1-stability line provide us with new interesting features .",
    "a good example is the neutron halo and other continuum - related properties of drip - line nuclei @xcite .",
    "another example can be the evolution of shell structure , including the change of magic numbers , due to characteristic properties of the nuclear force @xcite , as being increasingly observed @xcite . although there are many bound nuclei between @xmath1-stability and drip lines showing the shell evolution , one eventually approaches the drip line , by adding more neutrons ( or protons ) .",
    "low - lying states are then in the continuum even if the ground state is still bound .",
    "thus , the physics of continuum and that of shell evolution should meet .",
    "it is of much importance to clarify how the coupling to the continuum affects various structures generated by the nuclear force .",
    "we shall study , in this paper , continuum spectra of neutron - rich o isotopes .",
    "the o isotopes show unusual shell structure and magic numbers ( @xmath2=14 , 16 ) @xcite , ending up with unbound @xmath3 orbit .",
    "the neutron drip line is quite different between o and f isotopes @xcite , which can be explained by unbound ( bound ) neutron @xmath3 orbit for o ( f ) isotopes .",
    "however , despite their importance , properties of unbound neutron @xmath4 states in o isotopes remain to be clarified .",
    "we extend the normal shell model ( sm ) so as to include continuum states as a part of sm basis . by this continuum - coupled shell - model ( ccsm )",
    "calculation , we can see precisely the location and shape of the peaks of various continuum spectra .",
    "although the use of an infinite wall belongs to standard techniques , the wall is placed at unusually far distance so that the sm basis includes many ( @xmath03000 ) discretized continuum states , both resonant and non - resonant .",
    "this allows us to produce spectrum shapes accurately and treat the asymptotic behavior of wave functions appropriately .",
    "a finite - range nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) force , which is consistent with successful sm interaction for bound states , is introduced for the evaluation of continuum effects , resulting in significant energy shifts from the bound(-state ) approximation .",
    "such novel approach leads us to quite interesting results , in agreement with recent experimental data .",
    "as the @xmath3 orbit remains unbound in oxygen isotopes , we generate discretized continuum single - particle basis states of @xmath4 , by introducing an infinite wall on top of the woods - saxon potential .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian is then written as , @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes kinetic energy and @xmath8 is the woods - saxon potential with radius @xmath9=@xmath10 fm , diffuseness @xmath11=@xmath12 fm .",
    "the depth parameter @xmath13 will be discussed later .",
    "the standard @xmath14 term is included @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath15 is an infinite wall placed at 3000 fm from the center of the nucleus so as to obtain a sufficiently high density of discretized states . as shown later , the final results do not depend on the position of the infinite wall if the wall is far enough .",
    "the i - th @xmath4 state is denoted as @xmath16 with @xmath17=@xmath18,@xmath19,@xmath20 .",
    "six neutrons are assumed , for simplicity , to be in the @xmath21 orbit .",
    "namely , the inert @xmath22o core is assumed in the following ccsm calculations .",
    "thus , the basis states of valence neutrons are constructed from the bound @xmath23 state and the discretized continuum @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) states with various sets of occupation numbers .",
    "the ccsm is proposed to treat correlations due to nuclear forces in continuum states in a manner consistent with the sm for bound states .",
    "realistic sm interactions are given usually in the form of two - body matrix elements ( tbme s ) . in order to calculate matrix elements of the hamiltonian for the continuum basis states discussed above",
    ", the sm interaction is extended to an analytic function , @xmath26 , depending on variables of two interacting nucleons . as the realistic sm interaction contains many effects , from free - nucleon scattering to in - medium polarization corrections , it is virtually impossible to express @xmath26 in a simple functional form for all single - particle orbits . on the other hand ,",
    "the continuum coupling is important for few selected orbits in many cases .",
    "for instance , in the present case , neutron active orbits are @xmath23 and @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is extended to continuum basis states .",
    "we introduce a simple @xmath26 as a modeling of a realistic interaction within this small model space .",
    "continuum @xmath24 states differ among themselves in their radial wave functions , and are mixed due to the coupling by nuclear force , producing correlated eigenstates even in the continuum .",
    "the coupling occurs primarily through the inner ( _ i.e. _ , resonance - like ) part of such wave functions , because in the outer part nucleons are far from each other .",
    "the inner part resembles , more or less , bound @xmath3 , apart from the overall amplitude .",
    "the interaction with a neutron in @xmath23 is important too .",
    "therefore , it is the minimal condition that @xmath26 should reproduce relevant tbme s of a realistic sm interaction involving bound ( _ i.e. _ , harmonic oscillator ( ho ) ) @xmath23 and @xmath3 orbits . in this work , @xmath26 is fixed by this minimal condition .    as a simple yet general form of @xmath26 , a superposition of two gaussian functions with spin dependences",

    "the other parameters are fixed later .",
    "the ccsm hamiltonian is then written as @xmath31 -5pt where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are , respectively , the single - particle energy ( spe ) and the occupation number operator , and @xmath34 denotes single - particle states including discretized continuum ones .",
    "we define the sm hamiltonian to be used for fixing @xmath26 .",
    "the sdpf - m hamiltonian @xcite , a revision of usd @xcite , is taken .",
    "the sdpf - m hamiltonian has been shown to be successful for describing bound _",
    "sd_-shell nuclei including those with a large number of neutrons .",
    "we begin with the fine tuning of the sdpf - m so that it can reproduce one neutron separation energy ( @xmath35 ) of @xmath36o exactly , by the following minor change of the monopole interaction , @xmath37 note that this change is less than @xmath38 of the original value . while this fine - tuned hamiltonian is for the full sm diagonalization",
    ", we introduce a simpler sm hamiltonian to be used in the filling configuration scheme .",
    "the filling configuration means that valence nucleons are put into the lowest possible orbit one by one , and the diagonalization is carried out within such configurations .",
    "this truncation makes sense if the valence orbits are well separated . for oxygen isotopes with",
    "@xmath39 14 , this is the case as represented by @xmath2=14 and 16 gaps @xmath04 mev @xcite .",
    "the spe s and tbme s appropriate for the filling scheme are determined so that the results of the fully mixed sm calculations are reproduced by the calculations in the filling scheme , as far as low - lying energy levels of @xmath40o relative to the @xmath22o ground state are concerned .",
    "note that the active model space is ( @xmath23-@xmath3 ) for the filling scheme .",
    "the resultant hamiltonian is referred to as _",
    "modified sdpf - m_.    next , the parameters of @xmath26 are determined from the modified sdpf - m hamiltonian .",
    "relevant tbme s @xmath41 are calculated for each term of @xmath26 by using ho single - particle wave functions .",
    "the parameters of @xmath26 are optimized by the @xmath42 fit to the corresponding tbme s of the modified sdpf - m , under the condition @xmath43 400 mev .",
    "one can uniquely determine the four parameters , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , by four constraints . if we do this , however , the parameters appear to be unnaturally large , while the final sm result turned out not to change much from the above one .",
    "we therefore choose the parameters fixed by the the @xmath42 fit mentioned above .",
    "the obtained values are @xmath46=39.9 mev , @xmath47=-409 mev , @xmath48=0.38 and @xmath490.09 .",
    "their validity will be examined from a different viewpoint later .",

    "we do not discuss the configuration ( a ) , because this is nothing but the bound ground state of @xmath51o .",
    "thus , only the configuration ( b ) is considered for the doorway state .",

    "the ccsm phase - shift calculations produce results in between or closer to ccsm doorway - state - emission calculation .",
    "since we discretize the integral equation ( [ eq:7 ] ) , we have to check the convergence of the gsm results as a function of the number of single - particle states belonging to the gamow basis .",
    "we confirmed that converged results can be obtained with 30 basis states .    in the gsm calculation , there is a degree of freedom to choose the deformed contour .",

    "the latter definition is equivalent to the situation that the radial wave function of the resonant state has the pure outgoing boundary condition @xcite . these two are of course related to each other , but their mathematical relation , which may have been noticed , appears to be not so simple , as discussed below .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the radial wave function is given by the combination of the hankel functions @xmath116 where @xmath55=@xmath117 . the coefficients can be expressed as @xmath118=@xmath119 = @xmath120 and @xmath121=@xmath122 .",

    "if the phase shift @xmath126 sharply increases by about @xmath94 in the vicinity of @xmath127 , going through @xmath92 at @xmath128 , the energy dependence may be approximated by @xmath129 it then follows that near @xmath130 , @xmath131 where @xmath72 and @xmath132 correspond to the peak energy and the width of the peak , respectively . combining with eq .",

    "the s - matrix takes , for real @xmath55 s , the form @xmath134 when this s - matrix is analytically continued to the complex momentum - plane , @xmath135 has a pole at @xmath136 in the lower half of the complex k - plane .",
    "we then obtain @xmath72 and @xmath132 , as discussed in @xcite , from the pole of the s - matrix , @xmath137 thus , the pole of s - matrix corresponds to the resonance state , only if this pole in the complex k - plane is close enough to the positive real axis and well isolated from other poles .",
    "if one applies the width for the 1@xmath78 state of @xmath51o shown in table  [ tab : gsm ] , the estimated shift of the peak energy turn out to be about 0.004 mev , which is small enough .",
    "the peak energies and widths obtained by the ccsm doorway - state - emission and phase - shift calculations can be compared with gsm results in table  [ tab : gsm ] for the same hamiltonian . at first glance ,",
    "the peak energies are in a good agreement among the three calculations . the width becomes smaller in going from the ccsm doorway - state - emission to the ccsm phase - shift , and to the gsm calculations in general .",
    "the difference may be partly due to the coupling / mixing between basis states evaluated differently among the three , and also due to the different boundary conditions as discussed .",

    "the same feature is seen in continuum calculations in ref .",
    "this problem has been avoided in the present work , focusing on the continuum coupling effect .",
    "we note that the present work has been started in 2002 @xcite , and has been refined in 2008 @xcite .",
    "the present work does not owe to results of @xcite , as it has been completed before @xcite .",
    "in summary , we introduced the continuum - coupled shell model ( ccsm ) .",
    "the ccsm hamiltonian is designed to include correlations due to a two - body nuclear force in the continuum , in a manner consistent with the realistic sm interaction for bound states .",
    "spectra of emitted neutrons from knockout reactions are calculated , in good agreements to recent experiments without adjustment to final results .",
    "the continuum effects are significant ; the difference from bound - state calculation is more than 1 mev for the cases studied .",
    "we point out that the 1@xmath78 - 2@xmath78 spacing of @xmath51o is smaller in the ccsm than in the bound - state calculation , and that the ccsm result indeed agrees well with the recent experiment @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the appropriate treatment of the nuclear force is still important in the continuum .",
    "we also calculated the resonance states by a phase shift approach and the gamow shell model ( gsm ) using the same hamiltonian ( eq .  ( [ h ] ) ) .",
    "the peak energies agree with those of ccsm doorway - state emission calculation rather will , although the doorway - state emission and the neutron - scattering resonance are very different processes in principle .",
    "the width of the resonance states were obtained to be smaller than the case of ccsm doorway - state - emission calculation .",
    "this difference originates partly in the differences between the doorway and the resonance states .",
    "on the other hand , the differences among the ccsm ( doorway ) , ccsm ( phase shift ) and gsm appear rather minor , particularly as far as the peak energies are concerned .",
    "the present work suggests that the high single - particle energies for the _ bound _",
    "@xmath3 , which are used for shell - model calculations for bound states , are indeed consistent with observed continuum properties . if they were not high enough , the continuum spectra would become too low compared to experiments .",
    "there should be a strong shell evolution mechanism so that this orbit comes down in f isotopes @xcite .",
    "as the ccsm idea naturally extends the successful sm interaction to continuum states ( or open quantum systems ) , its future developments into full configurations and more applications to exotic nuclei are intriguing issues .",
    "for instance , the continuum `` ground state '' of @xmath138o attracts much interest as a possible `` mother of pearl '' of neutron nugget / matter .",
    "the continuum effect was not taken into account for bound states in this paper for simplicity .",
    "there may be some cases where the continuum couplings can be crucial even for bound states , _",
