    "chorus in the earth s magnetosphere is a type of whistler wave that has been analysed for decades using ground - based and satellite observations .",
    "intensive studies have gone into understanding the generation and propagation of these waves , and how they affect the magnetospheric plasma ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "chorus is believed to be excited by cyclotron resonance with anisotropic ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 correspond to directions perpendicular and parallel to the background magnetic field ) electrons with energy @xmath7 kev injected into the inner magnetosphere .",
    "studies have shown that the resonance between chorus and relativistic electrons plays an important role in radiation - belt dynamics ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "for example , pitch angle scattering by chorus is a major loss mechanism for trapped electrons in the outer radiation belt .",
    "local acceleration due to interactions between chorus and electrons inside the radiation belt may be a major mechanism for enhanced relativistic electron population ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "an important feature of chorus is the presence of a gap at one - half the electron cyclotron frequency in its spectrum , separating two frequency bands ( therefore called `` banded chorus '' ) , a lower band with 0.1 @xmath8 0.5 and an upper band with 0.5 @xmath8 0.8 @xcite , where @xmath1 is the electron cyclotron angular frequency .",
    "such banded chorus is not unique to the earth s magnetosphere , but is also observed in saturn s magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "recently , using cluster spacecraft measurements , @xcite reported that sometimes chorus can have more than two bands , with additional gaps near @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "most of these `` multi - banded ''",
    "chorus events were observed with oblique wave normal angles during disturbed geomagnetic conditions .",
    "an example of multi - banded chorus observed by van allen probes a on feb 10 , 2013 is shown in figure [ fig : obs ] .    the narrow gap at @xmath9 between the two bands of chorus has received a lot of attention since it was discovered ( for a review of existing theories , see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite hypothesized that two bands of chorus are excited by two different electron populations with temperature anisotropies through linear instability , and the hypothesis has been tested in a case study using van allen probes data by @xcite .",
    "@xcite explored the possibility of generating the lower band through nonlinear wave - wave coupling of the upper band chorus . @xcite",
    "assumed that different bands are generated in ducts of either enhanced or depleted cold plasma density .",
    "@xcite explained the gap at @xmath9 , where the group velocity of the whistler wave equals the phase velocity , as nonlinear damping of a slightly oblique whistler wave packet propagating away from the magnetic equator , taking into account the spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic field . despite intensive research ,",
    "a conclusive explanation for banded chorus has not been given yet .",
    "existing models for banded chorus have only considered the primary ( linear ) resonances when the resonant particles described by unperturbed orbits see a `` time - independent '' wave field .",
    "however it was recently found that the nonlinear resonances which develop by taking into account the perturbed particle motion in the wave field can also prompt energy exchange between the wave and particles .",
    "for instance , island overlapping due to nonlinear resonances can cause stochastic ion heating in an oblique alfvn wave with a sub - cyclotron frequency in the solar corona @xcite .",
    "can the nonlinear resonance happen between chorus and electrons ?",
    "if it can , how will it affect the electrons and chorus ?    inspired by the interesting feature of nonlinear resonances at sub - cyclotron frequencies , we propose the following scenario for the banded chorus observation illustrated in figure [ fig : obs ] .",
    "a warm ( a few hundred ev ) , anisotropic ( @xmath10 ) electron velocity distribution drives the whistler anisotropy instability @xcite , which gives rise to continuous narrowband ( @xmath11 ) enhanced magnetic spectra that appear as a relatively coherent temporal waveform .",
    "the cold electron ( 1 - 100 ev ) response , as will be shown by both theoretical analysis and test - particle simulations in this work , demonstrates that there is a nonlinear wave - particle interaction whereby certain electrons come into subharmonic resonance with certain fourier components .",
    "if this interaction transfers energy from the fluctuations to the electrons , the resonant fourier components will be damped and the fluctuation spectra will develop gaps at @xmath12 and other subharmonics as shown in figure [ fig : obs ] .    in this paper , we show that , in the absence of primary resonances , an oblique whistler wave with a frequency at a fraction of @xmath1 is able to resonate with the cold electrons nonlinearly , leading to nonlinear damping / growth of the wave with certain electron distributions .",
    "this nonlinear mechanism , which involves only wave - particle interactions and works in homogeneous plasmas with a uniform magnetic field , can provide a complementary element to existing theories on chorus .",
    "in addition , it can explain additional gaps in chorus spectra around @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as reported recently by @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present a theoretical framework for analysing the dynamics of electrons in an oblique whistler wave with uniform background magnetic field .",
    "the structures of nonlinear resonances are analysed using poincar maps by solving the equations of motion numerically and confirmed by our theoretical calculations employing the lie perturbation method . in section 3 , we show the results of test - particle simulations for an ensemble of electrons with certain velocity distributions .",
    "the effects of nonlinear resonances on the electron distribution function and the total kinetic energy are investigated . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss how this nonlinear mechanism is related to frequency gaps in magnetospheric chorus .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we analyse the dynamics of electrons in a single oblique whistler wave and an uniform background magnetic field using hamiltonian theory .      for simplicity , we consider a uniform plasma in a uniform background magnetic field , @xmath13 , and the whistler wave dispersion relation in the cold plasma limit is given as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 2 - 45 ) ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the plasma frequency , @xmath16 is the wave number , and the whistler wave is oblique with a small wave normal angle @xmath17 with respect to the background magnetic field so that @xmath18 .",
    "assuming @xmath19 and using the cold plasma theory @xcite , the vector potential can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the phase of the wave and @xmath22 denotes the perturbation magnitude . to eliminate electric fields",
    ", we move to the wave frame by a transformation , @xmath23 .",
    "normalizing time to @xmath24 , magnetic field to @xmath25 , mass to @xmath26 and length to @xmath27 , the normalized hamiltonian for the electron is given by @xmath28 + \\epsilon \\left [ p_x\\sin\\psi + ( p_y + x ) \\cos\\theta\\cos\\psi\\right ]    + \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon^2 ( 1 -   \\sin^2\\theta\\cos^2\\psi)\\ , , \\label{eq : h}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the canonical momenta and @xmath32 . in the wave frame , the electron energy is conserved as @xmath33 does not depend on time explicitly and @xmath30 is a constant of motion since @xmath33 is independent of @xmath34 .",
    "a set of equations of motion for the electron can be readily obtained from the hamilton s equation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath35\\nonumber\\\\   & & -\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{2}\\alpha \\sin^2\\theta\\sin(2\\psi),\\\\   \\dot{z}&=&p_z,\\\\   \\dot{p}_x&=&-\\epsilon[p_x\\cos\\psi-(p_y+x)\\cos\\theta\\sin\\psi]-\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{2}\\sin^2\\theta\\sin(2\\psi ) , \\label{eq : eom4 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where dots represent time derivatives .    without loss of generality ,",
    "we choose the following parameters relevant to chorus in the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "the whistler wave satisfies @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , where @xmath40 is the speed of light and @xmath41 .",
    "so the parallel phase speed of the wave is @xmath42 , and the energy is normalized to @xmath43 kev .",
    "note that the choice of the whistler wave frequency is for illustration purpose .",
    "it will be shown later that , for waves closer to @xmath9 , the difference is only in the energy of resonant electrons .",
    "the extension to a whistler wave packet with multiple fourier components is also straightforward @xcite .",
    "unless otherwise specified , the above parameters are used in the rest of the paper .      in our hamiltonian model , electrons are moving in a 4-dimensional phase space @xmath44 . with poincar surfaces of section ( or maps )",
    ", one can visualize the wave - particle resonances in phase space .",
    "we construct a poincar map in @xmath45 by recording points when the trajectory of an electron in phase space crosses the surface of @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "electrons are initialized with @xmath46 , @xmath48 , fixed @xmath33 and a range of parallel velocities @xmath31 s . in the top panel of figure [ fig : poinc ] , a map for electrons with energy @xmath49 is shown in the presence of an oblique whistler wave with @xmath50 . in the map , a major island in @xmath51 plane located at @xmath52",
    "demonstrate trapping of particles by the wave satisfying @xmath53 ( note @xmath54 before normalization ) , which is the well - known landau resonance condition .",
    "another set of two islands develop at @xmath55 , which corresponds to a new resonance condition @xmath56 suggesting that electrons can resonate with finite amplitude oblique whistler waves at half cyclotron frequency .",
    "a similar mechanism has been proposed for the sub - cyclotron resonance between ions and oblique alfvn waves @xcite . with higher energy ,",
    "the primary cyclotron resonance between electrons and the whistler wave can be seen from the island located at @xmath57 ( not shown ) .",
    "we can show that the half cyclotron resonance is the result of nonlinear dynamics by taking into account the perturbed electron orbit in the presence of wave fields .",
    "the analysis is greatly simplified in the so - called guiding - center coordinates . through a canonical transformation @xcite ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the unperturbed guiding - center hamiltonian and @xmath60\\,,\\\\ h_2 & = & - \\frac{1}{2}\\sin^2\\theta\\cos^2(\\alpha \\sqrt{2j}\\sin\\phi + z)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath61/2 $ ] denotes the perpendicular energy and @xmath62 the gyro - angle .",
    "interestingly , if the whistler wave is purely parallel to the background magnetic field ( @xmath63 ) , @xmath64 vanishes and @xmath65 contains only the primary resonance .",
    "so the electron dynamics becomes integrable and there will not be any nonlinear resonance .",
    "due to the dependence of the perturbed hamiltonian on @xmath62 and @xmath66 , both @xmath67 and @xmath31 vary in time . these variations are related to the magnetic drift of the guiding center which can then give rise to nonlinear resonances via the @xmath68 term with @xmath69 being the magnetic drift .    to analyse the perturbed hamiltonian",
    ", we introduce the lie transform method ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) which utilizes particular canonical transformations to obtain perturbation series in terms of poisson brackets .",
    "similar to the approach in @xcite , a generating function @xmath70 is obtained to remove the first order perturbations by setting @xmath71 + h_1 = 0 $ ] with @xmath72 $ ] being the poisson bracket .",
    "this generating function indicates singularities when @xmath73 , with @xmath74 being any integer . in the laboratory frame",
    ", they simply correspond to the well known cyclotron resonance condition @xmath75 when @xmath76 and the landau resonance condition @xmath77 when @xmath78 .    after the lie transformation ,",
    "the new hamiltonian becomes @xmath79/2 ) + o(\\epsilon^3 ) $ ] , where the second order perturbation reads @xmath80\\ , , \\label{eq : h2}\\ ] ] with @xmath81 .",
    "the functions @xmath82 are introduced for simplicity .",
    "their explicit expressions are tediously long and will be presented later in a separate paper .",
    "the new hamiltonian clearly shows the existence of nonlinear resonances when the phase @xmath83 remains a constant or @xmath84 . in the laboratory frame",
    ", they correspond to the second order resonance conditions @xmath85 .",
    "the second term in equation ( [ eq : h2 ] ) does not contribute to resonances .",
    "therefore , our analytical calculation confirms the existence of the nonlinear resonance at the half cyclotron frequency ( @xmath86 ) . following the result in @xcite , we know that the island width of second order resonances is proportional to @xmath87 while it is @xmath88 for the primary resonances .",
    "this means the damping due to second order resonance is weaker than the primary resonance by square root of the wave magnitude .",
    "continuing to the third order expansion , we will obtain resonances at @xmath89 which is present in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : poinc ] where the wave has a larger wave amplitude .",
    "a wave - particle resonance causes efficient energy exchange between the wave and resonant particles .",
    "for example , a wave is damped via landau resonance while the resonant particles gain same amount of kinetic energy the wave loses . to further illustrate how the nonlinear resonance , at @xmath90 , can damp waves around the half cyclotron frequency , we perform test - particle simulations of a large number of electrons and investigate the changes in the electron distribution and their kinetic energy in the presence of an oblique whistler wave .    in our test - particle simulation , about @xmath91 electrons with maxwellian velocity distribution in the lab frame , @xmath92,\\ ] ]",
    "are loaded initially . here",
    "we choose electron temperatures @xmath93 ev so that @xmath94 .",
    "electrons are advanced according to equations of motion given by equations.([eq : eom1])-([eq : eom4 ] ) . in the presence of an oblique whistler wave with wave amplitude @xmath95 ,",
    "the energy ( calculated in the lab frame ) evolution of these electrons is shown in figure [ fig : energy]a .",
    "after initial oscillations , the averaged energy per electron ( @xmath96 ) increases at a rate @xmath97 ( where @xmath98 is the averaged initial energy per electron ) and the energy gain is predominantly in the perpendicular direction . in a self - consistent simulation where the wave field follows maxwell equations and the total energy of the system",
    "is conserved , the increase of the electron energy must come from the decrease of wave energy .",
    "this implies that the wave will be damped by the nonlinearly resonant electrons .",
    "the rate of particle energy gain normalized to the wave energy is @xmath99 .",
    "the electron velocity distributions in the wave frame at @xmath100 are shown in figure [ fig : energy]b .",
    "clearly , the parallel velocity distribution @xmath101 deviates from the initial maxwellian in the vicinity of @xmath102 , which corresponds to the second order resonance shown in the poincar map in figure [ fig : poinc ] .",
    "the changes in both @xmath103 and @xmath104 are small ( not shown ) . for the given maxwellian distribution function , the nonlinear cyclotron damping steepens the gradient of @xmath101 around @xmath102 , causing the parallel kinetic energy to decrease , and the perpendicular kinetic energy to increase ( see figure [ fig : energy]b and [ fig : energy]c ) .",
    "this is similar to the primary cyclotron resonance where the electrons are scattered along the constant energy surfaces in the wave frame as pointed out by @xcite .    just like",
    "the landau or cyclotron resonance , the nonlinear resonance can lead to damping / growth of the waves at sub - cyclotron frequencies when the electron distribution satisfies certain conditions ( the stability criteria ) .",
    "even though the particle motion is described as periodic in our theoretical analysis and test - particle simulations , what determines the wave damping / growth rate is how fast the resonant particles can take ( give ) energy from ( to ) the perturbed fields .",
    "this is the same as in landau or cyclotron damping , which requires the resonant particles to gain energy at a rate faster than their bounce frequency in the perturbed field .",
    "the wave begins to saturate when this condition is violated .",
    "the difference in the nonlinear damping mechanism is that the relevant bounce motion is now described by the second order perturbed hamiltonian and thus becomes much slower than the linear bounce motion .",
    "a test - particle simulation describes the particle dynamics at the beginning stage of the wave - particle interaction and can predict the rate of energy gain or loss by resonant particles depending on the distributions , as discussed in the following .",
    "when the temperature anisotropy @xmath105 is strong enough , the nonlinear resonance may also lead to decrease of the particle energy and thus instability of the whistler wave .",
    "this is demonstrated by a comparison of runs with different initial anisotropies , as shown in figure [ fig : anisotropy ] .",
    "same parameters as those in figure [ fig : energy ] except the perpendicular temperature are used in these runs . for @xmath106 ,",
    "the electrons lose energy , which implies wave growth in a self - consistent situation .",
    "interestingly , for anisotropies well below the instability threshold , the temperature anisotropy can enhance the nonlinear wave - particle resonance , as shown by the case with @xmath107 initially .",
    "this is consistent with our analysis as in equation ( [ eq : w1 ] ) where a factor of @xmath108 shows the dependence on the particle perpendicular energy .    to further illustrate the sub - cyclotron resonance and clarify that the energy gain of electrons is not dominated by numerical heating or the pseudo - heating @xcite in our simulations",
    ", we carry out two comparison test cases . in the first case , we artificially load electrons with @xmath101 flat in the range @xmath109 as shown in figure [ fig : flat](a ) . due to the nonlinear resonance near half cyclotron frequency ,",
    "electrons gain energy from the wave . in the second case",
    ", we remove the resonant particles within @xmath110 from the distribution as shown in figure [ fig : flat](b ) . the resulting energy gain in the lab frame ( figure [ fig : flat]c )",
    "is significantly reduced .",
    "therefore it is clear that the dominant energy gain of electrons is caused by the nonlinear resonance .",
    "in the earth s magnetosphere , cold plasmaspheric electrons ( @xmath111 1 ev ) extend into a region called the `` plasma trough '' with @xmath112 ( @xmath113 is the equatorial distance of a magnetic field line from the center of the earth in the unit of earth s radius ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where they meet @xmath111 1 kev electrons from the plasma sheet .",
    "banded chorus is frequently observed in this region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we conjecture that the gap of the banded chorus may be caused by the nonlinear damping of oblique whistler waves by these cold electrons with energy 1 - 100 ev . for 10 ev electrons ,",
    "whose thermal velocity @xmath114 , the nonlinear resonance condition ( equation [ eq : nl_condition ] ) becomes @xmath115 , i.e. , these electrons could damp oblique whistler waves with frequency near @xmath9 , leaving a gap in the wave power spectrum .",
    "wave analysis often shows chorus is quasi - parallel , but we have also shown that even with a wave normal angle of @xmath116 , nonlinear wave - particle interactions can be significant .",
    "furthermore , even if the chorus is excited purely parallel in the source region close to the magnetic equator , as the wave propagates away from the equator , it will soon have an oblique component due to the curved nature of earth s dipole - like magnetic field .    here",
    ", we have presented cases with a modest wave amplitude @xmath117 to better illustrate the nonlinear resonance mechanism with less computational constrains .",
    "the numerical integration scheme can introduce errors into the particle s energy , therefore , for smaller wave amplitudes , we need to both reduce the time step to suppress the numerical heating and increase number of particles to resolve the resonance structure in phase space .",
    "typical amplitude of chorus in the magnetosphere is about @xmath118 , but large amplitude whistler waves have also been reported with @xmath119 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". the sub - cyclotron resonance can be strong and effective in damping these large amplitude whistler waves as shown in the previous section . for smaller wave amplitude ,",
    "we have also carried out test - particle simulations with @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "the results ( not shown here ) indicate that the same nonlinear resonance occurs , although the rate of the electron energy gain is reduced ( @xmath124 ) due to the lower wave amplitude .",
    "therefore the proposed nonlinear damping mechanism at sub - cyclotron frequencies is robust and can play a role for waves observed in the magnetosphere .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of multiple whistler modes ( or a narrow band ) near half cyclotron frequency , the nonlinear damping is expected to be enhanced due to the overlapping of resonances as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this effect will be addressed in a separate paper .",
    "if the wave amplitude increases to @xmath125 , additional resonant islands near @xmath126 and @xmath127 develop in the poincar map ( figure [ fig : poinc ] , bottom panel ) , which may explain the additional gaps near @xmath2 and @xmath3 observed by @xcite . as @xcite reported , multi - banded chorus were observed during more disturbed times with the average kp @xmath128 , larger than the average kp @xmath129 for chorus observed with one or two bands . these higher order",
    "nonlinear resonances , as well as the half cyclotron resonance we have shown , belong to a set of nonlinear resonant conditions below the cyclotron frequency , @xmath130 , where @xmath131 are integer and @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a nonlinear resonant mechanism between an oblique whistler wave and electrons , satisfying the resonant condition @xmath133 , by theoretical analysis and test - particle simulations .",
    "our mechanism works in a homogeneous plasma with a constant background magnetic field , and may explain the frequency gap at @xmath134 frequently observed in the power spectra of magnetospheric chorus .",
    "further more , similar nonlinear resonances may explain the frequency gaps at @xmath135 and @xmath3 in chorus observations recently reported by @xcite and as shown in figure [ fig : obs ] .",
    "this mechanism provides a complementary element to existing theories on banded chorus . the detailed theoretical analysis ( section 2 )",
    "will be presented in a separate paper later .",
    "the ability of this nonlinear mechanism to explain frequency gaps in chorus emissions needs to be further investigated in a self - consistent way ( e.g. via particle - in - cell simulations ) to address the dependence of damping rates on various plasma and wave parameters .",

    "<S> we find that an oblique whistler wave with frequency at a fraction of the electron cyclotron frequency can resonate with electrons , leading to effective energy exchange between the wave and particles . </S>"
