    "<S> we propose a new approach to the determination of hadronic observables in which the essential features of chiral symmetry are combined with conventional constituent quark models . to illustrate the approach , we consider the simple quark model in the limit of su(3 ) flavour symmetry at the strange quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with data is made after an analytic continuation which ensures the correct leading nonanalytic behaviour of chiral perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the approach not only gives an excellent fit for the octet baryon magnetic moments but the prediction for the @xmath0 magnetic moment is also in good agreement with current measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> quark models have traditionally suffered from two major shortcomings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first they have omitted the effects of the pion and kaon clouds which give rise to non - analytic behaviour in the quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> second , implicit in the simple constituent quark picture is the idea that the contribution made by a quark to a hadronic observable is independent of its environment . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the contribution of the @xmath1 quark to the magnetic moment of the neutron ( @xmath2 ) and the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is usually taken to be the same . however , for the quark masses considered in lattice qcd calculations , these environment effects are easily observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the clearest indication of a problem is the enormous violation of charge symmetry in the constituent quark masses quoted by the particle data group @xcite , with @xmath5 mev and @xmath6 mev , differing by an unacceptable 5% .    </S>",
    "<S> recent studies of the variation of hadron properties as a function of ( current ) quark mass within lattice qcd @xcite have led to new insights into hadron structure , which suggest a relatively simple approach to overcoming these problems , while avoiding the complexities of fully - fledged chiral quark models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , these studies have revealed the following behaviour with quark mass @xcite :    * in the region of current quark masses @xmath7 mev or so ( @xmath8 greater than typically 400 - 500 mev ) hadron properties are smooth , slowly varying functions of something like a constituent quark mass , @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 ) . * indeed , @xmath11 and magnetic moments behave like @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> * as @xmath13 decreases below 60 mev or so , chiral symmetry leads to rapid , non - analytic variation .    </S>",
    "<S> the speed with which rapid chiral variations are suppressed above 60 mev or so suggests that this is the region in which constituent quark models should be most appropriate . </S>",
    "<S> the connection to the physical world , including quantitative fits to experimental data , should be undertaken after chiral extrapolation in a manner consistent with the general constraints of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath14pt ) .    with this in mind </S>",
    "<S> , we explore the utility of employing a quark model in the region of heavier quark mass and then extrapolating to the physical world with an analytic continuation of @xmath14pt . </S>",
    "<S> this extrapolation function builds in the leading nonanalytic ( lna ) behaviour of @xmath14pt and therefore explicitly incorporates the pion and kaon contributions in extrapolating to the chiral regime . as a first example we illustrate this procedure with the simple su(6 ) constituent quark model ( cqm ) in the calculation of octet baryon magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> we begin with the cqm in the limit of su(3)flavour symmetry where all three quarks have the same mass  taken to be the strange quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> these baryon magnetic moments , determined at large quark masses where constituent quark degrees of freedom are manifest @xcite , are then analytically continued to the physical mass regime . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting description of the experimental octet baryon magnetic moments is excellent and when applied to the charged @xmath15 baryons the model also produces values in good agreement with current data .    in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we first present the extrapolation technique used to link the baryon moments calculated near the limit of su(3)flavour symmetry to the physical world . </S>",
    "<S> we then present the details of the model ( referred to as accessqm ) and apply it to the baryon octet . the extrapolation technique utilized here to link baryon magnetic moments at large quark masses with the physical mass regime </S>",
    "<S> has only recently been exploited in lattice qcd . here </S>",
    "<S> we extend the previous approach @xcite incorporating pion cloud contributions ( ) =  , [ pion ] to include the kaon cloud . in order to place the leading non - analytic ( lna ) kaon contribution in the denominator , </S>",
    "<S> we replace @xmath16 by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the kaon mass in the su(2 ) chiral limit    ( ) =   . </S>",
    "<S> [ pade ] we stress that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are model independent constants fixed by chiral perturbation theory ( see table  [ table : chi ] ) and only @xmath21 and @xmath22 are fit parameters . </S>",
    "<S> further , using the gell mann - oakes - renner relation for the pion and kaon masses , one has ^2 </S>",
    "<S> = m_k^(0)^2 + ^2  , for fixed strange quark mass , with m_k^(0 ) =  .    </S>",
    "<S> .the baryon chiral coefficients , @xmath23 , for the spin-1/2 octet . </S>",
    "<S> coefficients are from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , with one - loop corrected values for @xmath24 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> note here we have suppressed the kaon loop contribution in the calculation of the @xmath26 by using @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 and 2 show the behaviour of the analytic continuation of @xmath14pt fitted to the two magnetic moments , one either side of the su(3)-flavour limit . </S>",
    "<S> these baryon magnetic moments near the su(3)-limit are indicated by a dot ( @xmath28 ) and experimental values for the baryon magnetic moments are given , at the physical pion mass , by an asterisk ( @xmath29 ) . to obtain the accessqm magnetic moment prediction one simply reads off the value of the extrapolation function at the physical pion mass . </S>",
    "<S> note , we have also included a fit where only the chiral behaviour associated with the pion - cloud is considered  this is indicated by the dashed line . </S>",
    "<S> these results are obtained by using the same values for the input parameters , only this time setting the respective @xmath26 s to zero in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pade ] ) prior to determining @xmath30 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident , from figs . 1 and 2 </S>",
    "<S> , that the role of the kaon - cloud is slight over the octet . indeed , it only plays a significant role for the @xmath31 , @xmath3 and @xmath32 magnetic moments .    </S>",
    "<S> a longstanding problem of the cqm is its prediction of the @xmath32/@xmath31 magnetic moment ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the cqm predicts this ratio is given by = ( 4- )  , which becomes = ( 4- )  , and is therefore less than 1 , as @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> experiment places this ratio at 1.06(1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of the meson cloud gives us the opportunity of solving this problem , and indeed we find from table  [ table : lot ] a ratio of 0.99 for the accessqm , compared with 0.81 for the cqm . </S>",
    "<S> while this is a significant improvement , there is a residual disagreement , suggesting the need to replace the very simplest cqm with something a little more sophisticated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that using the very simplest cqm , with all three quark masses near the physical strange quark mass , and extrapolating to the physical mass regime using an analytic continuation of @xmath14pt which ensures the correct lna behaviour in the chiral limit , does offer a considerable improvement to the theoretical predictions of the spin1/2 baryon octet magnetic moments , as compared to those of the cqm alone . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate the importance of incorporating the meson cloud contribution in any calculation of baryon magnetic moments as well as the need to accommodate the hadronic environment of the constituent quarks .    </S>",
    "<S> this work serves to introduce the idea that one should merge the general class of constituent quark models with known chiral properties of hadronic observables . while the results presented here display great promise , </S>",
    "<S> there is a demonstrated need for further refinement . for example </S>",
    "<S> , one could explore the possibility that decuplet baryon intermediate states make an important contribution in the chiral extrapolation . </S>",
    "<S> for the decuplet itself there is limited experimental data , but for the @xmath0 , which is known to lie in the range [ 3.7,7.5 ] @xmath34 @xcite , with the latest experimental measurement yielding @xmath35 @xcite , the application of the model outlined here yields a value of 4.67 @xmath34  in good agreement with the data . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions for the remaining charged @xmath15 baryons are @xmath36 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> it will also be possible to tune these models to data at larger quark masses from the new generation of lattice qcd simulations now underway . finally , there is also an important opportunity to refine the constituent quark model itself , where spin - dependent interactions @xcite between quarks can give rise to important contributions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is our hope that the ideas presented here will lead to a new appreciation of the role of the constituent quark model in modern hadron phenomenology in which there is no longer a conflict with the constraints of chiral perturbation theory . </S>"
