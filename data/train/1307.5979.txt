    "their properties and interrelations have been intensively investigated @xcite , including a third proposal for a volume operator by bianchi , dona , and speziale @xcite .",
    "the latter one is closer to the concept of spin foams @xcite and relies on an older geometric theorem due to minkowski @xcite .",
    "volume operators are usually considered in connection with polyhedra .",
    "the most elementary objects of this kind are tetrahedra consisting of four faces which are represented by angular momentum operators coupling to a total spin singlet @xcite . here",
    "all three definitions of the volume operator coincide . among the most recent developments , bianchi and",
    "haggard have performed a bohr - sommerfeld quantization of the volume using an appropriate parameterization of the classical phase space of a tetrahedron , and the obtained semiclassical eigenvalues agree amazingly well with exact numerical data @xcite .    the purpose of the present communication is to point out that , in the sector of large eigenvalues , the volume operator of such a quantum tetrahedron is accurately described by a quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "our presentation will continue as follows : after briefly summarizing important features of the quantum tetrahedron and its volume operator in section [ tet ] , we derive our central result , starting from numerical observations , in section [ vol ] .",
    "we give explicit formulae for the large - eigenvalue sector of the ( square of the ) volume operator and also analyze its scaling behavior as a function of the tetrahedron size . in section [ rec ]",
    "we discuss the role of different angular momentum coupling schemes , and in section [ concl ] we close with an outlook .",
    "a quantum tetrahedron consists of four angular momenta @xmath0 , @xmath1 representing its faces and coupling to a vanishing total angular momentum @xcite , i.e. the hilbert space consists of all states @xmath2 fulfilling @xmath3 in what follows we will adopt the coupling scheme where both pairs @xmath4 and @xmath5 couple first to two irreducible su(2 ) representations of dimension @xmath6 each , which are then added to give a singlet .",
    "thus , the quantum number @xmath7 ranges as @xmath8 with @xmath9 leading to a total dimension of @xmath10 .",
    "the volume operator can be formulated as @xmath11 where the operators @xmath12 @xmath1 represent the faces of the tetrahedron with @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the immirzi parameter . as seen form eq .",
    "( [ defv ] ) it is useful to consider the operator @xmath15 which , in the basis of the states @xmath2 , can be represented as @xcite @xmath16 with @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the area of a triangle with edges @xmath19 expressed via herons formula , @xmath20 note that @xmath21 couples only basis states @xmath2 with neighboring labels . in the following",
    "it will be convenient to readjust the phases of these states via the unitary matrix @xmath22 such that the resulting operator becomes real , @xmath23 since @xmath21 is antisymmetric , the spectrum of @xmath21 and , in turn , @xmath24 consists for even @xmath25 of pairs of eigenvalues @xmath26 differing in sign .",
    "moreover , because of @xmath27 with @xmath28 , the corresponding eigenstates @xmath29 , @xmath30 fulfill @xmath31 for odd @xmath25 an additional zero eigenvalue occurs whose eigenvector ( with respect to @xmath21 ) has the unnormalized form @xcite @xmath32 which is , as it must be , an eigenstate of @xmath33 .",

    "we denote by @xmath37 , @xmath38 , the eigenstates of @xmath24 in descending order of eigenvalues with @xmath39 being the state with the largest eigenvalue . in the above basis",
    "they can be expanded as @xmath40 where the coefficients @xmath41 can be viewed as the `` wave function '' of the state @xmath37 with respect to the `` coordinate '' @xmath7 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows this data for small @xmath34 and a typical choice of angular momentum quantum numbers ( all being of order a few ten ) . as seen there , the functions @xmath41 show the characteristic features of wave functions of the harmonic oscillator for low - lying states .",
    "indeed , the solid lines in fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] are gauss - hermitian oscillator wave functions for parameters to be determined a few lines below .",
    "such properties of the functions @xmath41 occur for arbitrary sufficiently large angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath42 and sets in when all @xmath42 exceed a value of about five . for illustration ,",
    "[ fig2 ] displays the data for the case @xmath36 where the oscillator - like features of the wave functions gradually disappear with increasing @xmath34 .",

    "the above features can also be established by a detailed analytical discussion of the function @xmath43 .",
    "now , since the operator @xmath24 couples only states with neighboring label @xmath7 , the wave functions with large eigenvalues will have predominantly support around the maximum of @xmath43 .",
    "we therefore expand the matrix elements of @xmath24 between arbitrary states @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( lying predominantly in the sector of large eigenvalues ) around @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath50 , where the decrement of @xmath51 accounts for the fact that @xmath52 couples states of the form @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in doing so , we obtain @xmath55 here we have introduced the notations @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and additionally performed a continuum approximation to the latter function according to @xmath58 from eq .",
    "( [ qmat ] ) one easily reads off an effective operator having the form of a harmonic oscillator , @xmath59 \\label{qeff}\\ ] ] with @xmath60 and @xmath61     for various choices of angular momentum quantum numbers .",

    ", we have constructed an effective operator describing the sector of large eigenvalues of the square of the volume operator of a quantum tetrahedron .",

    "table  [ table1 ] was generated by first finding numerically the maximum position @xmath49 of @xmath43 and inserting this value into an analytical expression of @xmath77 to obtain @xmath78 via eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) .",
    "thus , no adjustable parameter is involved .",
    "closed analytical results for @xmath49 are possible if the four angular momenta come in two pairs of equal length , and the expressions become particularly simple in the case of a regular tetrahedron , @xmath79 . here one has @xmath80 such that the parameters entering the effective operator ( [ qeff ] ) are given , to leading orders in @xmath81 , by @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 thus , the eigenvalues ( [ oscev ] ) of the effective operator read to the first leading orders in @xmath81 @xmath85 in particular , from eq .",
    "( [ omegaj ] ) we see that the width @xmath86 of the wave functions ( [ oscwf ] ) is proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , for the largest eigenvalue of the volume operator , one finds from eq .",
    "( [ defv ] ) @xmath88 here the leading term @xmath89 is exactly the classical volume of a regular tetrahedron whose faces have area @xmath81 , and the subleading correction is , after a redefinition of the face area , identical to the one found in ref .  @xcite using bohr - sommerfeld quantization .",
    "furthermore , our findings here suggest that the classical volume of a general tetrahedron with face areas @xmath90 is , to leading order in all @xmath42 , given by @xmath91    as already discussed in section [ tet ] , the large eigenvalues @xmath68 have counterparts @xmath92 with the the same modulus but negative sign , and according to eq .",
    "( [ signchange ] ) , the pertaining eigenvectors can be obtained from the previous ones by changing the sign of any other component . regarding the wave functions ( [ oscwf ] ) one could try to mimic this behavior by attaching an appropriate phase factor , @xmath93 however , the above functions are clearly not eigenfunctions of the effective operator ( [ qeff ] ) .",
    "in fact , an operator having @xmath94 as eigenstates with eigenvalues @xmath95 can be constructed as follows : @xmath96\\,.\\label{qeff2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this operator is not invariant under a time reversal@xmath97 which corresponds to the fact that the eigenfunctions ( [ oscev  ] ) can not be chosen to be real . moreover , the operators @xmath98 and @xmath99 are , along with their eigenfunctions , obviously just related by a u(1 ) gauge operation , apart from the global minus sign on the r.h.s of eqs .",
    "( [ qeff1 ] ) and ( [ qeff2 ] ) .",
    "however , since @xmath99 is merely a consequence of the rather phenomenological ansatz ( [ oscev  ] ) , a more rigorous effective description of eigenstates with negative eigenvalue is desirable",
    ". work in this direction could possibly build upon ideas of ref .",
    "@xcite where the quantity @xmath100 was considered as an effective potential for states with eigenvalues of both sign .",
    "there are obviously alternatives to the coupling scheme of angular momenta we have used so far . for instance , instead of the previous procedure , @xmath101 and @xmath102 could first be coupled to two irreducible representations of dimension @xmath103 each , which are then combined to a total singlet . the operator @xmath24 is then expressed in a form analogous to eq .",
    "( [ defq ] ) with matrix elements @xmath104 given by the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) and obvious interchanges of labels . as seen before",
    ", @xmath104 has a unique maximum at some @xmath105 .",
    "thus , putting again @xmath106 , the eigenstates with large eigenvalues will again be accurately approximated by oscillator wave functions @xmath107 according to eq .",
    "( [ oscwf ] ) with @xmath108 and the corresponding approximate eigenvalues read @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "since the exact spectrum of @xmath24 is of course independent of the coupling scheme used , this holds as well , to an excellent degree of approximation , for the approximate eigenvalues , as it is easily checked by numerics . for instance , for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and table  [ table1 ] we find @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "thus , we have , as an again excellent approximation , @xmath115 which in particular means that the wave functions @xmath116 and @xmath107 can be taken as identical .",
    "moreover , since switching to another coupling scheme implies just a change of basis in the hilbert space , the above two gauss - hermitian wave functions should be related by a unitary transformation , @xmath117 with some phase factor @xmath118 , @xmath119 .",
    "an obvious solution is given by @xmath120 and @xmath121 , while another possibility follows from the well - known fact that the fourier transform of a gauss - hermitian function is a function of that same type : here one has @xmath122 and @xmath123 thus , up to the scale factor @xmath78 occurring in eq .",
    "( [ trafo2 ] ) , changing from one coupling scheme to another just corresponds to a fourier transform of the approximating oscillator wave functions .",
    "this observation is of course strongly reminiscent of switching from real space to momentum representation in standard quantum mechanics .    on the other hand , treating @xmath7 and @xmath124 again as discrete state labels , the basis states in both coupling schemes are related by @xmath125 using wigner @xmath126-symbols in the standard convention of prefactors @xcite . for the case of all angular momenta being large",
    "compared to unity , ponzano and regge @xcite have devised the following asymptotic expression for such quantities ( for more recent developments , see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath127 here @xmath128 is the volume of a tetrahedron having edge lengths @xmath129 , @xmath130 where edges occurring in the same column of the @xmath126-symbol are opposite to each other , i.e. do not have a common vertex , and @xmath131 is the external dihedral angle between faces joining at edge @xmath42 .",
    "the cosine occurring in the above equation bears some similarity to the exponential in the transformation ( [ trafo2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , under a rescaling of all angular momenta , @xmath132 , @xmath128 scales obviously as @xmath72 , such that the prefactor of @xmath133 in eq .",
    "( [ recoup ] ) is proportional to @xmath134 , which is the same scaling behavior as in ( [ trafo2 ] ) .",
    "however , we leave it to future studies to more deeply investigate the possible relationship between the transformations ( [ trafo2 ] ) and ( [ recoup ] ) .",
    "we have shown that the ( square of the ) volume operator of a quantum tetrahedron is , in the sector of large egenvalues , accurately desribed by a quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "this finding is a consequence of the fact that ( i ) the volume operator couples only neighboring states of its standard basis , and ( ii ) its matrix elements show a unique maximum as a function of state labels .",
    "the ingredients of the harmonic oscillator constructed here are an appropriate coordinate variable and a momentum operator defined by the corresponding derivative .",
    "these two quantities fulfill the canonical commutation relation .",
    "we give explicit formulae for the large eigenvalues of the volume operator in terms of the equidistant harmonic oscillator spectrum .",
    "it is an interesting speculation whether or not these linear excitations of space are related to gravitational waves .",
    "moreover , in this limit the quantum tetrahedron is naturally described semiclassically by oscillator coherent states , in contrast to other approaches where tensor products of su(2 ) coherent states projected onto the singlet subspace are used @xcite .",
    "we have also analyzed the scaling properties of the oscillator parameters as a function of the size of the tetrahedron . for a regular tetrahedron",
    "we reproduce recent findings @xcite on the largest volume eigenvalue and generalize them to the next smaller eigenvalues . in terms of classical geometry ,",
    "our approach here also suggests an interesting expression given in eq .",
    "( [ vcl ] ) for the volume of a general tetrahedron . to further investigate this conjecture",
    "might be , from a more mathemaitcal perspective , a route for future studies ( possibly starting from numerical tests ) .",
    "here we have shown the result only for the very special case of a regular tetrahedron .",
    "finally , we have discussed the role of different angular momentum coupling schemes .",
    "one might argue that the findings here on the tetrahedral volume operator are in fact very general : expanding a classical system described by just one pair of canonical variables @xcite around an extremum will generically lead to an effective harmonic oscillator .",
    "an interesting point here is that this oscillator - like behavior sets in at already quite moderate lengths of the involved angular momenta ( being about five ) .",
    "moreover , the quantum number resulting from the coupling of angular momenta has an immediate interpretation in terms of the oscillator coordinate .",
    "the present work exclusively deals with tetrahedra , i.e. , in the language of spin networks , 4-valent nodes @xcite .",
    "an obvious and interesting question is how the results found here translate to higher nodes .",
