    "the dust emission heated by ultraviolet ( uv ) and optical photons dominates the infrared ( ir ) output for majority of galaxies . from the beginning of the universe ,",
    "about half of the bolometric emission of galaxies has been transported to mid - infrared ( mir ) to far - infrared ( fir ) @xcite . since the celestial mir & fir photons suffer serious extinction when they run into the atmosphere surrounding us , the observations above the absorbers , such as some types of molecules like water and carbon dioxide , are essential for ir astronomy .",
    "since the successful launch of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) in 1983 , more advanced space - based infrared telescopes had been launched , such as @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , and @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13(@xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "dust is considered to be formed in the outer atmosphere of evolved stars , then is ejected out to interstellar space by stellar wind or some types of supernovae . so far , many models have been proposed to scale the emission of dust ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and one of them is the silicate - graphite model @xcite .",
    "recently , on the basis of the observations of @xmath0 , a new version of silicate - graphite model has been demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "this model contains different grain species including silicate & graphite & pah ( stand for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon , @xcite ) , whose abundance and size distribution were derived to fit the average ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and reproduce the average extinction curve of milky way .",
    "since then , this model has been revised by some studies , such as @xcite , who used the @xmath0 and @xmath1 images of large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) to restrict the behavior of diverse dust grains .    without consideration of the dust emission heated by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , the fir luminosity ( @xmath15100@xmath2 m ) of a galaxy",
    "is generally dominated by emission of dust in thermal equilibrium with temperature of about 15@xmath1220k , which will be treated as cool dust throughout this paper ; while the fir luminosity ( @xmath16100@xmath2 m ) is dominated by the dust in thermal equilibrium with the temperature of higher than 30k , which is normally refered as warm dust .",
    "the mir continuum ( @xmath1630@xmath2 m ) comes from the emissions of vsgs ( stand for very small grains , @xcite ) heated stochastically by single uv photon released by young stars in star formation regions .",
    "mir continuum is also characterized by some broad emission features @xcite , which are realized to be from pahs . in these years , the understanding on the emissions of pahs has been prompted based on the observations of @xmath7 and @xmath0 , and a tight correlation between the emissions of pahs and cool dust has been found and studied @xcite .",
    "low metallicities and the presence of agns could lead to the weakening of pahs emissions @xcite . in a previous work @xcite , on the basis of the @xmath0 wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ;",
    "* ) , we also found two tight correlations between 24@xmath2 m vs. 70@xmath2 m luminosities , and 8@xmath2 m vs. 160@xmath2 m luminosities , respectively .    because of the complication and diversity of ir emission , @xcite employed three mips ( stand for multiband imaging photometer for @xmath0 , @xcite ) bands , 24 & 70 & 160@xmath2 m fluxes to compute total ir luminosity ( @xmath3 )",
    ". nevertheless , for nowaday ir facilities , the sensitivity and angular resolution decrease gradually with increasing wavelength .",
    "hence , in most cases , we could only use mir photometries , such as 8@xmath2 m or 24@xmath2 m , to estimate @xmath3 . on the basis of the observations of @xmath0",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that both the metallicity and the star formation intensity can influence the accuracy of the estimation of @xmath3 if only one or two ir wave band photometries were used . adding the observations of @xmath1",
    ", @xcite recalibrated the correlations between @xmath3 and various monochromatic ir luminosities , then presented the discrepancy of @xmath3 between from sed fitting and from scaling of monochromatic ir luminosities .",
    "they also shown that the discrepancy was a function of ir color , while the ir color was sensitive to current star formation .    in this work",
    ", we will add the @xmath1 photometries to investigate the correlations among various monochromatic ir luminosities .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the construction of our sample and the estimation of multi - wavelength luminosities in @xmath172 .",
    "the major results on correlation analysis are presented in @xmath173 . some discussions and a summary of this work",
    "are given in @xmath174 and @xmath175 , respectively . throughout this paper",
    ", we adopted a @xmath18cdm cosmology with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "because we need the spectral redshift to calculate the distance and luminosities for ir selected galaxies , firstly we downloaded a series of processed catalogs from mpa website , then merged them together .",
    "these catalogs contain @xmath23 sources included in the spectral sample of data release seven ( dr7 ) of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "besides raw data , the mpa - jhu team has also derived some physical quantities , such as spectral redshift , emission line fluxes , stellar masses & metallicities .",

    "the @xmath0 swire is the largest extragalactic survey program among the six @xmath0 cycle-1 legacy programs .",
    "this survey contains six regions , with a total field of @xmath2449 deg@xmath25 . because of the limitation of the coverage of sdss and @xmath1 , just two northern swire fields , lockman hole ( center : 14 41 00 , + 59 25 00 ) & elais - n1 ( center : 16 11 00 , + 55 00 00 )",

    "we cross - matched the irac/24@xmath2 m catalog with sdss catalog with the radius of 3@xmath26 .",
    "after removing the repeated - crossing sources , @xmath27 galaxies were left . before",
    "cross - matching with the 70 and 160@xmath2 m photometries , we first did statistics of their astrometric precision : the mean values of 1@xmath28 position uncertainty are 1.5 & 3.5@xmath26 for the 70 and 160@xmath2 m detected sources , respectively",
    ". then , we used the @xmath27 galaxies in the optical - mir catalog to match the 70 and 160@xmath2 m catalogs with the radius of 4.5 & 10.5@xmath26 , the 3@xmath28 position uncertainties . finally , there were 253 optical - mir galaxies that have both 70 & 160@xmath2 m detectable fluxes .",
    "it should be noted that the telescope - limited resolution of @xmath0 is 18@xmath26 & 40@xmath26 at mips 70 & 160@xmath2 m , much larger than the cross - matching radius we have used .",
    "inevitably , in order to improve the accuracy of our sample , the completeness of the sample has been sacrificed and we must have lost many fir sources .",

    "500@xmath2 m was used by hermes team .",
    "the @xmath28 of the gaussian shaped psf at 250@xmath2 m is about 7.8@xmath26 , which was employed by us as the radius to match with the sdss - spitzer catalog . after matching ,",
    "185 sources were left . if we enlarge the matching radius to 23@xmath26 , 3 times the radius we used above , there are total of 188 @xmath1 sources left .",

    "weak agn - hosting galaxies are very popular in the local universe @xcite .",
    "agns can strengthen mir continuum , and weaken pahs emission or even destruct the carriers @xcite .",
    "therefore , the probable contribution from agn to mir & fir emissions would introduce significant bias on the correlations among those monochromatic ir luminosities . in this study , the traditional bpt diagnostic diagram : [ nii]/h@xmath29 versus [ oiii]/h@xmath30 @xcite was used to remove agn and composite galaxies ( starburst @xmath31 agn ) @xcite . in the @xmath32 galaxies of our sample , @xmath33 of them ( with the signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n ) of the four emission line fluxes @xmath15 3 ) could be treated as star - forming galaxies without contamination by agns , and are illustrated in the left panel of figure 1 .",

    "we estimated the monochromatic ir luminosities by using spectral redshift and the mir & fir fluxes provided by above surveys .",
    "for the two @xmath37 mir bands , 8 & 24@xmath2 m , the fluxes from kron photometry were adopted as total fluxes ; for the two @xmath37 fir bands , 70 and 160@xmath2 m , the prf ( stand for point - response function ) photometric fluxes were adopted ; for the three @xmath1 fir bands , 250 , 350 and 500@xmath2 m , the psf photometric fluxes were adopted .    besides the pahs features and vsgs continuum , photosphere of evolved stars could contribute to the output at rest - frame 8@xmath2 m @xcite , too .",
    "hence , only we could estimate a galaxy s 8@xmath2 m dust luminosity after reducing the component of stellar continuum .",
    "a factor of 0.232 @xcite was used to scale the star light of 3.6@xmath2 m to that of 8@xmath2 m , with the assumption that the entire irac 3.6@xmath2 m band emission is from stellar emission , and based on the _",
    "starburst99 _ synthesis model @xcite , assuming solar metallicity and a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) between 0.1 and 120 @xmath38 .",

    "can be neglected since the emission of the evolved stars photosphere decreases dramatically with increasing wavelength . a template mir spectrum of a local hii galaxy ngc  3351 ( from sings , @xmath0 infrared nearby galaxies survey ; @xcite ) , was convolved by using the spectral response curve of mips 24@xmath2 m band to obtain the k - correction at 24@xmath2 m .    in our sample , all the galaxies fluxes at 70 , 160 ,",

    "however , the slope of our nonlinear fit of l[8(dust ) ] vs. @xmath3 is a little steeper than that in @xcite , and this discrepancy could be due to the different galaxy population between these two samples : the galaxies in @xcite are all nearby ones , even include some optical dwarfs , but lack of ir luminous galaxies ( locate at up - right in the left panel of figure 8) , which prefer to have higher sfrs and lower ratios of l[8(dust ) ] to @xmath3 .",

    "additionally , we could see , for the galaxies with higher sfrs or higher ssfrs , the ratio between the @xmath45@xmath43@xmath44 derived from l[8(dust ) ] ( use both our and @xcite s formulae ) and @xmath3 from sed fitting descends gradually , which indicates again that l[8(dust ) ] is not as good as l[24 ] and l[70 ] to trace on - going star formations . for the galaxies with higher",
    "ssfrs , the ratio between the @xmath45@xmath43@xmath44 derived from l[24 ] and @xmath3 from sed fitting increases slightly , but this tendency can not be seen in the left - bottom panel .",
    "one of the probable explanations is the galaxies with higher ssfr , rather than higher sfr , lack of cool dust grains , so the overestimation of @xmath45@xmath43@xmath44 derived from l[24 ] is unavoidable ; another possible explanation is that the radiation field of the whole galaxies has been dominated by the young hot stars for the galaxies with higher ssfr .",
    "consequently , for the galaxies with intense star formation , if we only employ mir luminosity dominated by the emissions related with young stars to compute the total ir luminosity , the overestimation seems to be inevitable ; whilst if we employ the formulae , which were derived on the basis of the monochromatic mir luminosity influenced significantly by the spectral features of pahs , the underestimation of the total ir luminosity would not be impossible .",
    "we present and analyze the correlations among l[8(dust ) ] , l[24 ] , l[70 ] , l[160 ] , l[250 ] , l[350 ] & l[500 ] for a sample of galaxies selected from the @xmath0 & @xmath1 data in two northern swire fields .",
    "the galaxies in our sample represent the local star - forming galaxies , lack of optical and ir dwarfs , as well as ulirgs .",
    "the main results described in this paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "the l[24 ] & l[70 ] of star - forming galaxies are found to be well correlated with each other , then correlated with extinction - corrected h@xmath29 luminosities .",
    "these correlations indicate the similarity of heating sources of vsgs and warm dust . therefore ,",
    "estimating sfrs by using l[24 ] & l[70 ] would be more available than using other monochromatic ir luminosities .",
    "nevertheless , only employing the monochromatic ir luminosities that are primarily relevant with young hot stars may overestimate the @xmath3 .    \\2 . for fir emissions",
    "longer than 100@xmath2 m , the contributions from warm dust vanished gradually with increasing wavelength .",
    "cool dust excited by isrf controls the emissions in these fir wave bands , especially for the galaxies with quiescent star formation .",
    "hence , a color correction would be useful when obtaining the sfr by using fir ( @xmath15100@xmath2 m ) luminosities .",
    "l[8(dust ) ] is composed of continuum of vsgs and character spectral features of pahs .",
    "l[8(dust ) ] is well correlate with fir ( @xmath15100@xmath2 m ) luminosities , especially with l[160 ] & l[250 ] .",
    "so we suspect the c - c stretch and c - h bending of ionized pahs are mainly excited by isrf , and the features of pahs follow the cool dust emission , rather than warm dust or vsgs emission related with star formation .",
    "l[8(dust ) ] could be used to derive the sfr , but may be not as good as l[24 ] & l[70 ] .",
    "we re - scale the correlations between the @xmath3 and l[8(dust ) ] .",

    "<S> on the basis of the observations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we present and analyze the correlations among various monochromatic infrared ( ir ) luminosities for star - forming galaxies , selected from two northern swire fields . the 24 & 70@xmath2 m luminosities ( l[24 ] & l[70 ] ) , dominated by the continuum of very small grains ( vsgs ) and warm dust in thermal equilibrium respectively , correlate with on - going star formation tightly . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from cool dust excited by evolved stars also increases as the wavelength increaseas in the far - infrared ( fir ) wavelength range . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral features of ionized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) around rest - frame 8@xmath2 m are exited by moderated radiation field related with evolved stars as well , rather than by intensive radiation field related with young stars . </S>",
    "<S> even though the carriers of pahs could be treated as some types of vsgs with smaller scale , the radiation condition between pahs and classic vsgs seems to be significant different . </S>",
    "<S> the formulae to calculate the total - infrared luminosity @xmath3 by using l[8(dust ) ] & l[24 ] are re - scaled , and we find that the l[8(dust ) ] ( l[24 ] ) formula may probably underestimate ( overestimate ) @xmath3 for the galaxies with remarkable current star formation activity .    </S>",
