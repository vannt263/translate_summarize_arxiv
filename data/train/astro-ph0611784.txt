    "the standard model of cosmology with the concordance set of parameters can successfully reproduce a broad range of the cosmological data such as the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and large scale structure ( lss ) .",
    "the relativistic degrees of freedom present after the bbn epoch in the standard cosmology are photons and three generations of neutrinos . in models of particle physics / cosmology , however , there are many candidates that could additionally contribute to the relativistic components of the universe : sterile neutrinos  @xcite , gravitational waves , ( pseudo-)nambu - goldstone bosons such as axions  @xcite and majorons  @xcite , and the active neutrinos themselves if they have large lepton asymmetries  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the energy density of the relativistic particles can be smaller than in the standard cosmology , if the thermalization of the neutrinos are ineffective as in the mev - scale reheating scenarios  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in a certain class of models , especially those accompanied by the late - time entropy production  @xcite , the ( final ) reheating temperature tends to be quite low , and it often falls in the mev range .",
    "therefore it is of great importance to study the possible effects of varying the effective number of the relativistic particles on the cosmological observations , not only to make the standard cosmology more established , but also to probe and constrain a certain class of models in the particle physics / cosmology .",
    "recent precise observations of the cmb anisotropies and lss make it possible to measure the relativistic degree of freedom in the universe through its effects on the growth of cosmological perturbations .",
    "these effects come from the fact that the density perturbation does not grow ( the gravitational potential decays ) during the radiation - dominated era",
    ". specifically , more relativistic degree of freedom causes more early integrated sachs - wolfe effect on the cmb power spectrum , which leads to higher first peak height .",
    "also , since it delays the epoch of the matter - radiation equality and makes the horizon at that time larger , the turnover position of the matter power spectrum is shifted to larger scales and the power at smaller scales are suppressed .",
    "therefore , by observing cmb and lss , we can measure the relativistic degree of freedom during the structure formation . in detail , assuming the smallest scale relevant to our observations to be about 5mpc , since the structure formation of that scale begins around the temperature @xmath4ev ( at which the scale enters the horizon ) , these observations probe the relativistic degree of freedom at @xmath5ev .",
    "thus , cmb and lss can measure the relativistic degree of freedom independently of another well - known probe , bbn , which measures it in much earlier universe around @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the most recent data sets of cmb and lss , respectively using the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) 3-year data @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) power spectrum data @xcite , and would like to discuss the constraints from them .",
    "the wmap data now can give clear features of the first and second peaks of the cmb power spectrum .",
    "in particular , the precision around the first peak has been already cosmic variance dominated and so has been the measurement of the early integrated sachs - wolfe effect . however , this is not the case for the measurement of the relativistic degree of freedom since it is almost completely degenerate with the value of the matter density .",
    "we would like to demonstrate this degeneracy by the wmap data alone analysis . then , as is well known , since the matter power spectrum has somewhat different degeneracy pattern from the cmb , it is broken by combining the cmb with the matter power spectrum data .",
    "we would like to see how and how much the degeneracy is broken by adding the matter power of the sdss lrg sample .",
    "related analyses of earlier data sets are found for example in refs .",
    "@xcite using pre - wmap data , in refs .",
    "@xcite using wmap 1st year data , and @xcite using wmap 3-year data , with various combinations of astrophysical data sets and priors for cosmological parameters .",
    "the new point of our analysis on the relativistic degree of freedom in the universe is to use the power spectrum of the sdss lrgs @xcite .",
    "although there are similar analyses using the power spectrum of the sdss main galaxies @xcite and/or the one of the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) @xcite , it is important to revisit the issue with the new power spectrum data .",
    "this is because not only have the lrgs more statistical constraining power ( the effective volume of the lrg survey is about 6 times larger than that of the sdss main galaxy sample and over 10 times larger than that of the 2dfgrs @xcite ) , but also there seems to have been a tension between the power spectra of the 2dfgrs and the sdss main galaxies @xcite .",
    "the discrepant measurements of the relativistic degree of freedom between these two samples as found in refs .",
    "@xcite ( we show the result of ref .",
    "@xcite in table [ tab : nnucomparison ] .",
    "compare the 4th and 5th lines ) are considered to be caused by this tension in the power spectra .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the discrepancy is due to the scale dependent bias which was not taken into account in the sdss main galaxy analysis .",
    "the lrg analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite models this effect of scale dependent bias in the same way as the 2dfgrs analysis and they found the extracted cosmological parameters , especially the matter density , are in excellent agreement with those from wmap alone and wmap+2dfgrs .",
    "therefore , it is useful and of great importance to investigate the relativistic degree of freedom using the lrg power spectrum and see whether the discrepancy in its derived value from the two galaxy surveys is resolved to give a reliable constraint .",
    "we describe our analysis method in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] and our results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mevreh ] , we briefly review a cosmological scenario with low ( mev - scale ) reheating temperature and explain how the relativistic degree of freedom is modified compared to the standard case . in sec .  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss our result in relation to previous works and see how much the current observations allow the relativistic component of the universe to deviate from the value in the standard cosmology .",
    "we also emphasize its implication for the lower bound on the reheating temperature .",
    "the quantity we try to constrain in this paper is the effective number of neutrino species , @xmath0 , which is widely used to quantify the energy density of the relativistic component in the early universe .",
    "it is given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the photon energy density , @xmath9 is the total energy density of photons , three active species of neutrinos and extra relativistic contribution , and @xmath10 is defined as @xmath11 using the photon temperature @xmath12 after the electron - positron annihilation .",
    "@xmath10 corresponds to the energy density of a single species of neutrino assuming that neutrinos are completely decoupled from the electromagnetic plasma before the electron - positron annihilation takes place and they obey fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "we constrain @xmath0 in the flat @xmath2cdm universe with the initial perturbation power spectrum which is adiabatic and described by power law .",
    "this model has 6 cosmological parameters , the baryon density @xmath13 , the matter density @xmath14 , the normalized hubble constant @xmath15 , the reionization optical depth @xmath16 , the scalar spectral index of primordial perturbation power spectrum @xmath17 and its amplitude @xmath18 ( @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the energy density normalized by the critical density ) .",
    "theoretical cmb and matter power spectra are calculated by the cmbfast code @xcite and @xmath21 by the likelihood codes of the wmap 3-year data @xcite and of the sdss lrg power spectrum data @xcite .",
    "we apply modeling of non - linearity and scale dependent bias as in ref .",
    "@xcite to the linear matter power spectrum before fitting to the lrg data . since we omit the process of  dewiggling \" ( which is found to be justified in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] ) , this modeling has two parameters , galaxy bias factor @xmath22 and non - linear correction factor @xmath23 .",
    "specifically , we connect the linear matter power spectrum @xmath24 and the galaxy power spectrum @xmath25 by @xmath26 we calculate the @xmath21 as functions of @xmath0 by marginalizing over the above parameters ( 6 parameters for wmap alone and 8 for wmap+sdss ) .",
    "the marginalization is carried out by the brent minimization @xcite modified to be applicable to multi - dimension parameter space as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .     as functions of @xmath0 .",
    "the red solid line uses the wmap 3-year data alone and the green dashed line uses wmap 3-year and sdss lrg power spectrum . ]",
    "we show the results of @xmath21 minimization in fig .  [",
    "fig : chi2 ] .",
    "we give the values of some of the best fit cosmological parameters as functions of @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nnu_parbest ] .",
    "we have checked that the results for standard three neutrino species agree with the wmap @xcite and sdss @xcite groups analyses . for the wmap 3-year alone",
    "case , it has been checked in ref .",
    "@xcite that the best fit @xmath21 and parameters agree . with regard to wmap and lrg combined analysis , our best fit parameter values for three neutrino species are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( we report here @xmath33 instead of @xmath18 to compare with ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the central values fall well within the 1@xmath36 ranges of the constraints derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and the 1@xmath36 errors are almost identical to those quoted in ref .",
    "this empirically shows that the  dewiggling \" we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] for the non - linear modeling can safely be neglected as is documented in the likelihood code of ref .",
    "this makes sense as follows .",
    "since the process of the dewiggling mainly decreases the amplitude of the acoustic oscillations in the matter power spectrum , it mostly affects the parameter estimation of @xmath13 .",
    "however , @xmath13 is more precisely determined by the cmb when we do the combined analysis so neglecting the dewiggling does not affect much the parameter estimation using the present galaxy clustering data .",
    "the limits corresponding to @xmath37 are @xmath38 for wmap 3-year alone and @xmath39 for wmap and sdss lrg combined .",
    "since @xmath21 functions show some asymmetric features , we derive 95% confidence limits by integrating the likelihood functions @xmath40 .",
    "this yields 95% c.l .",
    "bound of @xmath41 for wmap alone and @xmath1 for wmap+lrg .",
    "we observe that the cmb alone constraint is very weak and the lss data significantly reduces the allowed region .",
    "we note that our wmap 3-year limit is somewhat weaker than the earlier constraints quoted as cmb alone limit @xcite , even though they use data before the wmap 3-year release .",
    "we compiled them in table [ tab : cmbalone ] .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite has derived @xmath42 ( 95% c.l . ) using the wmap 1-year data alone , much more stringent than our bound @xmath41 .",
    "we can ascribe this apparent discrepancy to the prior on @xmath15 adopted by ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath43 , which affects @xmath0 constraint through the well - known @xmath44 degeneracy .",
    "we find this degeneracy in our analysis too as in fig .",
    "[ fig : nnu_parbest ] ( b ) ( although we show the result for @xmath45 , for example , @xmath46 can fit the wmap 3-year data with @xmath47 ) .",
    "they are positively correlated which is explained as follows .",
    "the effect of increasing @xmath0 on cmb power spectrum is cancelled by increasing @xmath14 so that the epoch of matter - radiation equality occurs at the same redshift .",
    "then , @xmath15 has to be increased so that @xmath48 leading to acoustic peaks at observed positions in the flat universe .",
    "these features are explicitly demonstrated by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : nnu_parbest ] ( a)(c ) .",
    "the degeneracy is broken by adding lss information as is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] . this can be understood by another well - known fact that the shape of the matter power spectrum is determined by the combination @xmath49 rather than @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath14 is varied , obviously it is impossible to find @xmath15 which preserves both @xmath51 and @xmath49 .",
    "thus , when we try to fit the cmb and lss simultaneously , @xmath15 faces the dilemma of fitting the cmb ( @xmath51 ) or the lss ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we can see this in the panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : nnu_parbest ] .    our final result , the constraint on @xmath0 from the wmap 3-year cmb power spectrum and the sdss lrg power spectrum , can be summarized as @xmath52 at 95% c.l .",
    ", whose center value is quite close to the standard model of three active neutrino species .",
    "we will be discussing the constraint in connection with other works in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .        a cosmological constraint on @xmath0 can also be obtained from the primordial @xmath53he abundance @xmath54 .",
    "while @xmath53he has logarithmic dependence on the baryon - to - phton ratio @xmath55 , the only parameter in the standard bbn , it is very sensitive to @xmath0 since it modifies the expansion rate during the bbn period and shifts the epoch of the neutron - to - proton ratio freeze - out .",
    "the deuterium , d , constrains these parameters almost in the opposite manner .",
    "it is quite sensitive to @xmath55 but has only mild dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "more details are found in e.g. refs .",
    "actually , the bbn bound is more conventional than the structure formation constraint but it has somewhat checkered history since it is very difficult to estimate systematic errors for deriving the primordial abundance from @xmath53he observations . although the d abundance is often considered to more robustly probe the primordial abundance , since it does not have much sensitivity on @xmath0 as mentioned above , systematic errors for @xmath0 estimation are dominated by those of @xmath53he .",
    "for example , recent studies have shown the importance of underlying stellar absorption @xcite .",
    "this leads to significant increase in @xmath54 and enlarged errors .",
    "therefore , the most recent @xmath0 constraints @xmath56 ( 68% c.l . ) @xcite has a higher central value and larger errors than the earlier results . nevertheless , the current bbn bound is significantly tighter than our wmap+lrg bound and is completely covered by our bound ( this is not the case for a so - called mev reheating scenario .",
    "the significance of bbn and cmb / lss is reversed in this scenario .",
    "we comment on it below ) . at this stage",
    ", we can say that the present cmb plus galaxy clustering data provides a complementary constraint to the bbn .",
    "our analysis shows consistency between the constraints derived from totally different physical processes and at distant epochs providing a strong support for standard cosmology , but relatively large error bars still leave some room for non - standard physics .",
    "lastly , let us comment on the implication of our results for mev - scale reheating scenarios . since the reheating temperature is an important but not yet known parameter that characterizes the early evolution of the universe , it is valuable to derive an observational constraint . as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : mevreh ] , our estimation of @xmath0 , in particular the lower bound of @xmath0 , provides us with the lower bound on the reheating temperature as @xmath3 mev , once we use the relation between @xmath0 and the reheating temperature given in ref .",
    "we caution that on the contrary to cmb+lss bound , the lower bound on @xmath0 obtained from @xmath54 such as the one of ref .",
    "@xcite we quoted above can not be taken at face value .",
    "this is essentially because @xmath57 in low - reheating scenario implies not only less radiation density but also less neutron - to - proton conversion rate , which greatly affect the @xmath53he yields by bbn .",
    "the latter effect was not taken into account when deriving the bound on @xmath0 in ref .",
    "that is why it can not be applied to the mev - scale reheating scenarios .",
    "it turns out that @xmath58 @xcite , which does not reject relatively large value of @xmath54 , does not give meaningful lower bound on @xmath59 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tr_nnu_he4 ] ( b ) ) . to derive a lower bound on @xmath59 from bbn data alone",
    ", one needs a concrete upper bound on the @xmath53he abundance , which is difficult to obtain due to a possibly large systematic error .",
    "more detailed discussion is given in ref .",
    "at present , cmb+lss do better job in setting lower bound on @xmath59 .",
    "it is quite intriguing that we have obtained the lower bound @xmath3 mev , which is just before bbn begins , even without resort to the bbn data .",
    "this is because the decoupling of the weak interactions accidentally occurs immediately before the bbn epoch . due to this coincidence",
    ", we were able to derive the concrete and tight bound on @xmath59 .",
    "so far , it has been considered that the observations on the light - element abundances are indispensable to probe the bbn epoch .",
    "however , our results unambiguously show that one can extract informations on the universe at @xmath60 by cmb+lss data , and that one does nt have to rely on the observed light - element abundances , which may have large systematic errors .",
    "when the planck data becomes available , the lower bound can be improved up to @xmath61mev , the decoupling temperature of the muon and tau neutrinos .",
