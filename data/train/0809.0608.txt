    "in contrast , for class i the rate for @xmath37 induced by the double mass insertion would be much larger than the mega bound , unless @xmath7 is very large and the soft masses are small ( for @xmath38 , @xmath39 has to be smaller than 150 gev in order to satisfy the bound @xmath40 from mega ) . on the other hand , scenarios falling in class ii",

    "we find that for class ii the region where _ both _ @xmath63 and @xmath64 could be discovered at present @xmath4-factories is excluded .",
    "therefore , if present @xmath4-factories discovered both rare tau decays , only supersymmetric models falling in classes iii , iv and class i ( for the case with ll - ll mass insertions ) would be allowed .",
    "this conclusion will be strengthened if the meg experiment at psi reaches the projected sensitivity @xmath65 without finding a positive signal .",
    "if this is the case , the observation of both tau rare decays at present @xmath4-factories would point to an origin of the tau flavour violation falling only in class iii .",

    "it is interesting to note that two of the most widely studied scenarios generating sizable rates for the rare decays , namely the supersymmetric see - saw model and the minimal su(5 ) grand unified model , fall in class i. to be precise , the supersymmetric see - saw model generates flavour violation in the ll sector  @xcite and the minimal su(5 ) model , in the rr sector  @xcite . for class",
    "i the bound eq.([class1 ] ) is quite stringent and disfavours the possibility of observing both rare tau decays at present @xmath4-factories for a generic point of the msugra parameter space .",
    "furthermore , the bounds derived in this paper for the mssm are conservative and typically become more stringent as the physics that generates the flavour violation is specified . indeed , as was shown in @xcite , two loop effects induced by right - handed neutrinos in the supersymmetric see - saw model generate the off - diagonal terms @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which contribute through a single mass insertion to @xmath70 in addition to the double mass insertion contribution considered in the present work .    to finish this section ,",
    "let us review other theoretical constraints on the rare tau decays that have been derived in the literature for the mssm .",
    "interesting bounds on the branching ratios of the rare lepton decays were derived in @xcite from requiring absence of charge breaking minima or unbounded from below directions in the effective potential .",
    "the respective resulting bounds on the lr and rl mass insertions read , @xmath71^{1/2 } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "if the origin of the lepton flavour violation in the rare tau decays could be pinpointed to the lr or the rl sector , the observation of @xmath63 or @xmath64 in the near future would set , following eq.([ccb ] ) , an _ upper bound _ on the scalar masses , @xmath79 gev , in order to avoid the appearance of dangerous charge breaking minima or unbounded from below directions in the effective potential .",
    "remarkably , the constraints on the rare tau decays derived in this paper could help to pinpoint the origin of the lepton flavour violation .",
    "as was argued before , if both @xmath80 and @xmath63 were observed in the near future , models falling in class iii , and possibly also in class iv , would be favoured over models falling in classes i and ii , especially if the experimental bound on @xmath70 reaches the level of @xmath42 . therefore",
    ", since models falling in classes iii or iv always involve a lr and/or a rl mass insertion , the bound eq.([ccb ] ) would apply at least for one of the rare decays , and accordingly an upper bound on the scalar masses would follow .",
    "namely , if future experiments show that @xmath81 but @xmath82 , it would follow that @xmath83 gev from requiring absence of charge breaking minima or unbounded from below directions in the effective potential .",
    "in this section we will derive , pursuing an effective field theory approach , a conservative bound on @xmath70 in terms of the branching ratios for the radiative tau decays .",
    "the resulting bound will be therefore completely model independent .",
    "our starting point is the electromagnetic transition amplitude for the processes @xmath84 and @xmath85 , eq .",
    "( [ transition ] ) .",
    "if both transitions exist in nature , the transition @xmath86 will be automatically induced through the nine diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : effopermeg ] . among these",
    ", the diagrams ( b3 ) and ( c2 ) do not contribute to the dipole form factors @xmath87 , @xmath88 , which are the only ones that induce the process @xmath89 .",
    "on the other hand , since the photon circulating in the loop is off - shell , all the form factors that induce the electromagnetic tau transition ( monopole and dipole ) will contribute to @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "however , in order to derive a bound of the form @xmath2 , we will be interested just in the contribution from the dipole operators , which are the only ones that induce the processes @xmath90 and @xmath80 .",
    "we estimate that the dipole form factors satisfy the following relations : @xmath91 from where it follows that @xmath92 \\log^2 \\frac{\\lambda}{m_\\mu}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] being @xmath93 a cutoff . assuming that each rare tau decay is dominated by just one of the dipole form factors , either the electric or the magnetic , one finally obtains @xmath94 where we have used @xmath95 tev . the resulting bound is too weak to have any practical application",
    ", although it is has the theoretically interest of setting an _ absolute _ lower bound on @xmath70 in terms of the rare tau decays . as the fundamental theory that generates the effective dipole operators becomes specified , new contributions to the rare muon decay",
    "will typically arise , thus strengthening considerably the previous bound .",
    "this is the case in particular for the minimal supersymmetric standard model considered in the previous section : the one loop diagrams that induce the process @xmath61 in the effective theory approach , figs .",
    "[ fig : effopermeg ] , correspond to much more suppressed three loop diagrams once the complete theory has been specified .",

    "[ fig : effoperme2 g ] .",
    "the result is @xmath97\\,.\\ ] ] as before , this bound can be rewritten in terms of the branching ratios of the radiative tau decays , yielding @xmath98 again far below the experimental upper bound , @xmath99  @xcite .",
    "we have derived in this paper theoretical constraints on the branching ratios of the rare tau decays of the form @xmath2 in the minimal supersymmetric standard model and in a completely general setup , pursuing an effective field theory approach .",
    "we have argued that in the mssm the observation of both rare tau decays implies , barring cancellations , a non - vanishing rate for the process @xmath100 through the double mass insertion in the slepton propagator .",
    "we have cataloged the sixteen possibilities for the double mass insertion in four classes , according to their dependence on @xmath7 , the fermion masses and the overall size of the scalar masses , which are the three parameters to which the constant @xmath3 is most sensitive to , and we have shown that for a wide class of models our bound constrains values for the branching ratios of the rare tau decays that are otherwise allowed by present experiments .",
    "we have shown that if present @xmath4-factories observe both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the underlying possible sources of flavour violation would be restricted to our class iii , and possibly class iv , unless the supersymmetric parameters take special values .",
    "this conclusion would be strengthened if the meg experiment at psi reaches the sensitivity of @xmath42 for @xmath70 without finding a positive signal .",
    "we have also discussed the complementarity of the constraints on the rare tau decays derived in this paper and the constraints stemming from requiring absence of charge breaking minima or unbounded from below directions in the effective potential .",
    "finally , we have derived for completeness theoretical constraints on the rare tau decay following an effective theory approach .",
    "the resulting bounds are too weak to have any practical interest , although they have the theoretical interest of setting absolute bounds on the rates of @xmath100 and @xmath101 in terms of the rates of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
