    "one of the most fascinating advances of recent years has been the discovery of the plethora of quantum states characterized by a non - trivial topological structure of the single - particle wavefunctions.@xcite while the role of topology in the quantum hall effect was recognized in the early eighties,@xcite it was not realized until much later that related topological states exist with other symmetries.@xcite in particular , it was shown about ten years ago @xcite that a particular kind of topological order known as @xmath6 topological order is present in the quantum spin hall effect  like the regular quantum hall effect this also occurs in two - dimensional systems but in the absence of a magnetic field ( in other words , in systems with time - reversal symmetry ) .",
    "it was around this time the physics of topological insulators really took off when it was predicted @xcite and subsequently measured experimentally @xcite that the quantum spin hall effect is realized in hgte / cdte quantum wells .",
    "this state has since also been predicted @xcite and observed@xcite in inas / gasb quantum wells .",
    "the most striking feature of these topological insulator states is that while the bulk exhibits a spectral gap , the edges ( or surfaces in three - dimensional cases ) support metallic ( gapless ) states with curious properties . in the case of the conventional quantum hall effects ,",
    "these edge modes are chiral , with the chirality determined by the sense of the external magnetic field .",
    "these states show a quantized conductance @xcite as the chiral nature implies there are no states to which electrons may be backscattered and hence no mechanism by which electrical resistance may be generated . the edge states of a quantum spin hall system however are quite different .",
    "they form a _",
    "helical liquid _ , meaning that the chirality and spin - polarisation are linked.@xcite in these helical liquids , an electron moving one direction forms a kramer s doublet with that moving the opposite direction meaning that a time - reversal symmetric impurity ( for example a non - magnetic impurity ) can not elastically backscatter electrons .",
    "this is a state sometimes dubbed a _ symmetry protected topological state_;@xcite breaking time - reversal symmetry annuls the topological protection ( for example , helical liquids may be formed in other contexts@xcite without the role of topology ) .    while the topological protection forbids _",
    "elastic _ backscattering from non - magnetic impurities which may naively be thought to lead to quantized conductance @xmath7 , no such simple result exists for _ inelastic _ backscattering when interactions are present.@xcite many forms of inelastic scattering have been investigated on the side of theory , including multiple scattering off impurities,@xcite random rashba spin - orbit coupling,@xcite umklapp interactions both with and without impurities,@xcite phonon scattering,@xcite and scattering from charge puddles.@xcite    no matter the source of the inelastic scattering , the result of all of these investigations is that the correction to conductance behaves as a power - law in temperature @xmath8 ( or possibly activated behavior in a clean system@xcite ) , which goes to zero as temperature goes to zero .",
    "the power is dependent on the exact scattering mechanism chosen , as well as luttinger liquid effects@xcite which are ever - present in one - dimensional systems",
    ".    experiments on helical edge states have been performed for both short edge channels , where the system length l is much smaller than the mean free path _",
    "l _ , and long edge channels , where @xmath9 .",
    "the first experimental study of the temperature dependence of helical edge transport was performed in ref .  .",
    "the authors measure the conductance of short edges ( @xmath10 ) of hgte / cdte quantum wells and find that it is a quantized close to @xmath11 and depends only weakly on temperature .",
    "longer edges of the order of @xmath12 have been studied in ref .  .",
    "their results show conductance well below the quantized value and rather temperature independent .",
    "transport properties have also been measured in inas / gasb quantum wells.@xcite in these systems the measured conductance is close to the quantized value and seems to be insensitive to temperature and even magnetic field variations over a large range of parameters .",
    "this behavior is observed for both short and long edge channels .    as possible ways to explain the lack of temperature dependence , a number of potential perturbations that weakly break time - reversal symmetry have been investigated , such as kondo impurities,@xcite dynamical nuclear polarization,@xcite exciton condensation@xcite and explicit addition of a magnetic field.@xcite no consensus has yet been reached to explain the discrepancy between theory and experiment and therefore more work must be done on both sides .    in this work , we concentrate on the time - reversal symmetric case , where we study the transport properties of a model that was first introduced in ref .   and includes interactions , impurity scattering , and a rashba spin - orbit term . in their work the authors study corrections to the _ dc _ conductance of short edges , while we concentrate on the conductivity of long edge channels .",
    "while the frequency dependence of the conductivity of a luttinger liquid ( ll ) has been studied both in the semiclassical regime @xcite and including weak localisation effects,@xcite the conductivity of a helical luttinger liquid ( hll ) remains largely unexplored .",
    "we study the conductivity of a hll first by means of a kinetic equation approach , from which we obtain the high and low frequency limits of conductivity .",
    "this fermionic approach is valid for a weakly interacting system when the luttinger liquid constant @xmath13 ; to investigate the more general case we supplement this approach with bosonization , being careful to highlight the links between this and the prior conceptually transparent fermionic calculations .",
    "this allows us to build up a complete picture of the conduction properties of this model over the whole of parameter space .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    ", we introduce the microscopic model of the helical edge state , while in section iii we discuss the kinetic equation formalism and the scattering terms which appear in the collision integral . in section iv",
    ", we give the solution of the kinetic equation for both the _ ac _ and _ dc _ limits , providing a critical comparison of these results . in section",
    "v we derive the bosonized version of the hamiltonian ( treating the disorder via the replica trick ) , the conductivity of this model is then derived in section vi , and we conclude in section vii .",
    "technical details are relegated to the appendices .    throughout the paper",
    "we use the conventions @xmath14 while performing the calculation and restore @xmath15 and @xmath16 in key results .",
    "we consider an infinite one - dimensional system of helical fermions .",
    "the electrons feel a density - density interaction and are subject to a nonmagnetic random disorder potential .",
    "the hamiltonian is thus a sum of three parts : @xmath17 additionally , the strong spin orbit coupling in the bulk which leads to the emergence of the helical edge states also breaks the @xmath18 spin rotation symmetry in the edge .",
    "the resulting helical liquid with broken @xmath19 symmetry is termed  generic helical liquid \" .",
    "the model we use to describe this generic hll was first introduced in ref .  .",
    "to fix our notation and to review the main ideas behind the model we will briefly review its derivation .",
    "the 1d helical system is translation invariant and momenta k are thus good quantum numbers for the eigenstates .",
    "furthermore , to lowest order in spin orbit coupling , the spin degree of freedom of the excitations is frozen out because each chirality has a well - defined spin direction .",
    "the effective low energy theory for the edge excitations is thus that of free spinless fermions , @xmath20 here @xmath21 are fermionic operators and @xmath22 denotes chirality .",
    "if we assume that time reversal symmetry holds , kramer s theorem ensures that for any k there exist two orthogonal eigenstates , created by fermionic operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 which are related by time reversal @xmath25 .",
    "the interaction and disorder contributions for spinful fermions read as @xmath26 here , @xmath27 denotes the spin in z - direction .",
    "however , as mentioned before in a generic helical liquid , spin rotation invariance around the z - direction will be broken by spin - orbit terms either due to structural inversion asymmetry or bulk inversion asymmetry in the bulk of the system .",
    "we therefore formulate the problem in the chiral basis @xmath28 in which the free hamiltonian is diagonal . in order to perform this rotation",
    "we follow ref .   and derive the rotation matrix from symmetry arguments .",
    "the operators @xmath29 of an electron with momentum k and spin projection @xmath30 along the z - axis are related to the chiral operators @xmath21 by a momentum dependent su(2 ) matrix @xmath31 , @xmath32 to preserve fermionic commutation relations the matrix has to be unitary @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , time reversal invariance entails the symmetry @xmath34 .",
    "because of these constraints the leading terms in @xmath31 for small @xmath35 can be written as @xmath36 @xmath37 is an effective parameter that describes the strength of spin - orbit coupling ; in the absence of any spin - orbit coupling we have @xmath38 .",
    "physically , it can be interpreted as the inverse length scale on which an electron keeps its spin orientation .    in the following",
    "we assume that interaction and impurity potentials are momentum independent , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the case of interactions",
    "this is justified if the potential is well screened by external media e.g. external gates .",

    "a diagrammatic representation of possible interactions processes is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : interactionshll ] .",
    "it is important to realize , that there is a fundamental difference between the case of conventional one dimensional fermions and the helical fermions discussed here .",
    "usually , one linearizes the spectrum of fermions around the fermi energy defining left and right movers with linear spectrum .",
    "however , both branches of the spectrum are always separated by a large momentum of roughly @xmath47 .",
    "in contrast to that , the spectrum of helical fermions possesses a  dirac point \" ,",
    "i.e. a point where the right and left moving branches cross .",
    "in particular the @xmath46 term only contributes to the low energy physics , if the system is close to the dirac point which explains why it is never discussed in the context of luttinger liquid .",
    "however , it will turn out that this process is crucial for the transport properties of a hll for sufficiently clean samples .",
    "one further thing should be mentioned at this point .",
    "the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 should be considered as effective couplings of the low energy theory after integrating out all degrees of freedom above the uv cutoff , which is given by the bulk gap .",
    "therefore , renormalization effects due to high lying states are already incorporated into the coupling constants and do not affect the physics apart from that .    in the following",
