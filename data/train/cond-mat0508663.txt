    "the propagation of fronts connecting different macroscopic states is a common occurrence in many non - equilibrium systems  @xcite .",
    "familiar examples range from solidification  @xcite to chemical reaction dynamics such as flames  @xcite and to the spatial spread of infections  @xcite through a susceptible population .",
    "previous work by many authors has shown that a useful way to classify such fronts is via the stability properties of the state being invaded .",
    "in fact , surprising differences , with regard to the selection of the speed of propagation  @xcite , the rate of approach to that speed  @xcite , the sensitivity to finite - particle number fluctuations  @xcite , and the stability to 2d undulations  @xcite , exist between fronts that propagate into metastable versus linearly unstable states .    in a previous work  @xcite , we addressed the question of the dynamics a new type of front , that which exists in a system containing a reaction - rate gradient in the direction of front motion  @xcite .",
    "our staring point was a simple infection model @xmath0 on a 1d lattice ( with spacing @xmath1 ) with equal @xmath2 and @xmath3 hopping rates  @xcite ; this process leads in the mean - field limit to a spatially discrete version of the well - known fisher equation  @xcite @xmath4 here propagation is into the linearly unstable @xmath5 state and @xmath6 is just the number of @xmath2 particles at a site , normalized by @xmath7 .",
    "we then assumed that the reaction rate would be a linear function of space , increasing in the direction of propagation , this type of gradient would be a natural consequence of spatial inhomogeneity , or could be imposed via a temperature gradient in a chemical reaction analog .",
    "also , this type of system arises naturally in models of darwinian evolution  @xcite , ( where fitness @xmath8 is the independent variable ; the birth - rate , akin to the reaction - rate here , is proportional to fitness ) .",
    "the naive equation describing such a model is the fisher equation ( [ fisher ] ) with a reaction strength @xmath9 varying linearly in space  @xcite @xmath10 this model gives rise to an accelerating front .",
    "we also introduced a _ quasi - static _ version of the model  @xcite , wherein the reaction rate function moves along with the front : @xmath11 with @xmath12 is the instantaneous front position , the precise definition of which we will discuss later .",
    "the minimum reaction rate @xmath13 is introduced so as to stabilize the bulk @xmath14 state , and plays no essential role in the following .",
    "this quasi - static problem should lead to a translation - invariant front with fixed speed @xmath15 .",
    "although important on its own , one might also try to view the quasi - static problem as a zeroth - order approximation to the original model , ( the _ absolute _ gradient case ) , where by ignoring the acceleration , one obtains an adiabatic approximation to the velocity @xmath16 with @xmath17 . in both models ,",
    "the reaction rate gradient was seen  @xcite to enhance tremendously the role of fluctuations , to the extent that the naive treatment via a reaction - diffusion , or mean - field , equation gave rise to  irregular \" behavior completely at odds with the original stochastic model .",
    "in particular , the reaction - diffusion system exhibited an extreme sensitivity to initial conditions not present in the stochastic model .",
    "furthermore , the quasi - static version of the reaction - diffusion system exhibited a front which accelerated without end , whereas the stochastic version of the model always achieved an asymptotic constant velocity steady state .",
    "to get some insight into the stochastic model , we employed a heuristic approach in which we mimic the leading - order effect of finite population number fluctuations by introducing a cutoff in the mean - field equation ( mfe )  @xcite .",
    "this cutoff replaces @xmath18 by zero if the density @xmath6 falls below @xmath19 for some @xmath20 constant @xmath21 ; this change in the reaction term prevents the leading edge from spreading too far , too fast .",
    "this idea has proven its reliability in the fisher system with _",
    "constant _ reaction rate where it correctly predicts the aforementioned anomalous effects  @xcite .",
    "simulation results  @xcite showed that the cutoff mfe does a quantitatively accurate job of tracking the actual front dynamics .",
    "we then used the cutoff mfe to study the front velocity , at a fixed spatial position , as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "this was done both for the absolute gradient model and for the corresponding quasistatic model . from the data",
    ", we concluded that both models exhibit velocities which increase , evidently without bound , as a function of @xmath7 , which is of course radically different than what had been encountered in the previous classes of propagating fronts .",
    "thus the cutoff treatment succeeded in showing why the long - time dynamics of the stochastic model is not at all correctly described by the naive reaction - diffusion system .",
    "in addition , the cutoff theory had the physically reasonable property , again in accord with the stochastic system , that at small enough @xmath7 , the velocity could be approximated by just taking a cutoff version of the usual fisher equation result for a _ fixed _",
    "reaction rate @xmath22 , i.e. neglecting the reaction - rate gradient across the front .",
    "this is so because the effective interfacial width , the distance over which the particle density drops from its bulk value @xmath20 to its cutoff value @xmath23 scales as log @xmath7 ; hence one can neglect the gradient if @xmath24 is small .",
    "the naive reaction - diffusion system , however , due to its ever increasing interface width , always feels the reaction rate gradient and never in this adiabatic regime .",
    "given the highly unusual velocity results , an analytic treatment of the cutoff system at large @xmath7 is clearly worthwhile .",
    "a very telegraphic version of this analysis , as applied to the quasi - static model , was presented in ref . .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present this analysis in detail .",
    "the continuum problem is treated first in sec .",
    "a treatment of the dependence of the velocity on the `` base '' reaction rate , @xmath25 is presented in the next section . in sec .",

    "[ pastcut ] , completing the analysis of the model . a summary and some concluding remarks then follow .",
    "in this paper we study the steady - state motion of fronts in the quasi - static version of our model . on the lattice , the solution has the `` slepyan '' traveling wave form  @xcite : @xmath26 where the field @xmath27 at each lattice site , @xmath28 , has the same history , shifted in time .",
    "the equation of motion then becomes a differential - difference equation for @xmath6 , which we write as a function of the variable @xmath29 : @xmath30 the cutoff in the reaction rate sets is when the density drops below some fraction @xmath21 of one particle per site , so that @xmath31 .",
    "we found  @xcite that @xmath32 yields excellent quantitative agreement with the stochastic model . in this quasi - static model ,",
    "the reaction rate is also only a function of the comoving variable @xmath8 : @xmath33 where we have chosen the origin of time such that the front position @xmath12 , defined by @xmath34 , is located at @xmath35 at @xmath36 .",
    "this definition is simplest one for the deterministic problem posed by the cutoff mfe ; other conventions are more convenient for simulation studies of the stochastic model  @xcite , but this merely corresponds to a slight change of @xmath25 .    in the spatial continuum limit , @xmath37 ,",

    ", this must be the dominant contribution for large negative @xmath226 , so the only acceptable roots are those with @xmath227 .",
    "we therefore decompose @xmath222 and @xmath205 into two factors , one with its zeros below @xmath228 , which we label by a `` @xmath3 '' superscript , and the other with its zeros above ( or equal ) , which we label by `` @xmath229 '' .",
    "formally , @xmath230 where @xmath231 we have chosen to explicitly break out the factors relating to @xmath204 in @xmath232 since they will play an essential role in the following , and the factor @xmath233 in @xmath234 so that the correct behavior at @xmath193 is maintained . then , via the standard wiener - hopf argument , @xmath235 it is easiest to proceed if we regularize the problem by effectively discretizing time , replacing the @xmath233 term in the operators @xmath236 , @xmath237 by @xmath238 where @xmath239 is some large integer .",
    "then , the operators become polynomials of order @xmath240 in the variable @xmath241 .",
    "further study reveals that @xmath242 then has @xmath243 zeros , @xmath234 has @xmath244 , @xmath245 has @xmath246 zeros , and @xmath232 has @xmath247 .",

    "we see that as expected the analytic result approaches the numerical results are @xmath40 increases , being quite accurate everywhere .",
    "the numerical results presented in this graph , in contrast to those presented throughout the rest of this paper , were not obtained through direct numerical simulation of the time - dependent equations , due to the high accuracy required to perform the comparison with the theory .",
    "our direct numerical simulations were performed via a straightforward euler simulation , which is only first - order accurate in the time step .",
    "extremely small time - steps would have been required to obtain the requisite accuracy .",
    "instead , we solved the linearized steady - state equation directly . as opposed to @xmath266 , which requires a full nonlinear solution , @xmath267",
    "is determined solely by the linearized equation .",
    "the procedure we employed was as follows : the solution past the cutoff was written as a linear superposition of the allowed modes , corresponding to the roots @xmath268 .",
    "the solution to the left of some conveniently chosen @xmath269 was written as a linear superposition of modes , with the reaction rate set at the constant value @xmath270 .",
    "the steady - state equations between @xmath269 and @xmath187 were written as a banded matrix , acting on the three sets of unknowns : the coefficients of the pre-@xmath269 modes ; the values of the field between @xmath269 and @xmath187 ; and the coefficients of the post-@xmath187 modes .",
    "this matrix depends on the two parameters @xmath40 and @xmath271 .",
    "now the pre-@xmath269 modes include two real modes , corresponding to the two solutions of the quadratic equation for @xmath90 . in order to match the airy function behavior ,",
    "the faster of these two modes must not be present .",
    "this is an eigenvalue condition of @xmath271 for a given @xmath40 .",
    "from @xmath271 we can back out @xmath262 , as presented in the figure .",
    "this procedure converges quadratically in the discretization @xmath272 .",
    "the convergence with respect to @xmath269 is exponentially rapid , and presented no problem .",
    "a comparison of the answers obtained in this manner with that obtained by direct numerical simulation , at low values of @xmath40 for which the latter calculation was feasible , verified the validity of this alternate approach .",
    "this new approach also sheds an interesting light on the selection problem inherent in the linearized steady - state equation .",

    "in summary , we have presented an analytical study of the velocity of fisher fronts in the presence of a gradient .",
    "this study exploits the fact that the velocity diverges as the local density of reactants increases .",
    "this divergence is one of the signposts of the extreme sensitivity to fluctuations of this class of models .",
    "one of the most surprising consequences of this sensitivity is the different order of the divergence in the continuum versus the lattice model ; whereas the velocity of the front in the continuum limit diverges as @xmath276,on the lattice , the velocity effectively diverges as @xmath277 .",
    "the relative insensitivity to the details of the matching to the post - cutoff regime is another characteristic feature of this problem .",
    "it is clear , for example , that the leading order results are completely independent of the post - cutoff dynamics .",
    "even the next order , which formally does depend on matching to the solution past @xmath48 , is in fact only very weakly modified by the  r \" modes arising from this region .",
    "this lack of strong dependence is no doubt a major part of the reason that the phenomenological cutoff theory works as well as it does in describing the stochastic model .",
    "obviously , the cutoff mfe approach can not capture any of the truly stochastic features of the original markov model .",
    "thus , the next step in our overall program for understanding fronts in gradients must involve adding back in the residual effects of finite particle number fluctuations to the cutoff theory . exactly how to do this is already unclear in the simpler case of the fisher equation front , where it has proven difficult to come up with a simple explanation for the numerically determined front diffusion constant .",
    "the first question to be answered for the gradient case is whether the front can be described as simply diffusing ( albeit with an anomalous diffusion constant ) or whether the fluctuation effects perhaps lead to even stronger stochasticity .",
    "we hope to report on this issue in a future publication ."
