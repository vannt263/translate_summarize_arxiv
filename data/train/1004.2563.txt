    "traditional condensed matter physics is based on two theories : symmetry breaking theory for phases and phase transitions , and fermi liquid theory for metals . within the fermi liquid theory",
    ", one assumes that the ground state wave function for the electrons can be approximately described by a slater determinant . in other words",
    ", one assumes that the many - electron ground state can be constructed by filling the single - particle energy levels .",
    "such an energy - level filling picture becomes a foundation for traditional many - body physics . in this paper , we will call states obtained by filling single - particle energy levels as energy - level - filling ( elf ) states .",
    "in addition to slater determinant states , fermion paired states are also elf states .",
    "we may view the elf construction of many - body states as an encoding method of a physically relevant subset of states .",
    "although a random many - body state can only specified by an exponential amount of data , hence making it impossible to specify and calculate physical properties efficiently , physically relevant states seem to have a much simpler entanglement structure .",
    "a generic elf state on a lattice can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 sums over the pairs of sites in the lattice . here",
    "we consider a simple example of paired spinless fermions , and unpaired fermions can also be represented as limits of such states .",
    "such a many - body fermionic state is encoded by polynomial amount information characterized by @xmath2 .",
    "a crucial property is that it is very easy to calculate the norm and the averages of any local operators for a elf state ; here `` easy '' means that the computational cost scales as a polynomial in the number of modes .",
    "this effective encoding and the ease of calculating physical quantities ( such as energy ) form the foundation of the standard mean - field theory for interacting electron systems .",
    "in such a elf approach , we may view @xmath2 as variational parameters and minimize the average energy by varying @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath3 that minimize the energy give us an approximated many - fermion ground state .",
    "from the form of @xmath3 we can determine which symmetry is broken and obtain the phase diagram of the system .",
    "however , the ground states for some strongly correlated electron systems can not be approximated by elf states , i.e. they can not be constructed by filling energy levels .",
    "one classic example is the filling fraction @xmath4 laughlin state@xcite @xmath5 although the @xmath6 state @xmath7 is a elf state , its cubic power , @xmath8 , is very different from any elf states . in order to obtain the low energy effective theories for systems that can not be described by elf picture such as spin liquids and non - fermi - liquid metallic states , a projective construction ( also known as slave - particle approach or parton construction ;",
    "see appendix [ pcon ] for a brief introduction ) was developed@xcite .",
    "those states may appear in high @xmath9 superconductors and other strongly interacting systems , and are by now widely used .",
    "just like the elf states , the projective states can also be characterized by a polynomial amount of information .",
    "so the projective approach can also be viewed as an efficient encoding of many - body states .    in the projective approach , we view the projective states as variational trial wave functions@xcite for obtaining approximate ground state .",
    "what makes the projective approach so attractive is that from the form of the projective state , we can usually obtain the low energy effective theory that describes low energy excitations@xcite . from the low energy",
    "effective theory , we have learned that projective states can capture many qualitatively new phenomena that elf states fail to describe , such as fractional charge , fractional statistics and topological orders@xcite .    however , it is much harder to calculate the norm and local expectation values in the projective approach . although expectation values can efficiently be calculated using variational monte carlo methods in the case that electron or spin operators can be expressed as the products of parton operators @xcite , monte carlo fails when those operators are expressed as sums of the products of parton operators @xcite . as such there is no general efficient way to calculate the norm and the average of local operators .    in a different development ,",
    "concepts of quantum information theory have allowed one to gain a better insight into the entanglement structure in ground states of generic hamiltonians of strongly correlated quantum spins .",
    "it has been shown that ground states of local hamiltonians obey so - called area laws , and that ground states can therefore be efficiently be represented by the class of so - called matrix product states in one dimension or projected entangled pair states ( peps ) in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "this class of states share some resemblances with the states obtained in the projective approach , as they can be understood as projections of locally maximally entangled pairs .",
    "importantly , techniques have been developed that make it possible to efficiently calculate expectation values of local operators for this class of states , as this can be done by contracting networks of tensor products . in this paper",
    ", we will show how to generalize such networks to include grassmann tensors , and show how they can be contracted efficiently .",
    "this allows us to define a large and important subclass of the states obtained in the projective approach for which it is possible to calculate expectation values .",
    "it also allows us to generalize all tensor product state methods to the fermionic case ; special subclasses include the recently introduced fermionic peps ( fpeps ) @xcite and the fermionic multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz @xcite .",
    "the grassmann tensor product states allow us to express the norms of the projective wave functions in terms of grassmann valued tensor network .",
    "similarly , the average of any local operators for the projective wave functions can also be expressed in terms of grassmann tensor networks with a few `` impurity '' tensors .    throughout our study",
    ", we will also find that the grassmann tensor product states can be more general than projective states .",
    "using grassman tensor networks , we can systematically construct more general strongly correlated states for both bosonic and fermionic systems .",
    "we only need polynomial amount of data to characterize the tensor network .",
    "thus the grassmann tensor network approach gives us an effective encoding for both fermionic and bosonic many - body states .",
    "calculating the norm and the expectation value of local operators for a tensor product state can be exponentially hard in general @xcite .",
    "however , many possible polynomial approximation schemes , including the tensor - entanglement renormalization group ( terg ) method , have been proposed in recent years@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will show how the terg method@xcite can also be applied to grassmann tensor network .",
    "in particular , this implies that the average energy and other physical quantities of a grassmann tensor network state in two dimensions can be calculated efficiently by using tensor network renormalization approach .",
    "this grassmann tensor network approach is the natural approach for expressing fermions in tensor network methods and hence provides a new starting point for studying strongly correlated bosonic / fermionic systems .",

    "the grassmann tensor product states derived in that way will usually contain long range connections , which is not necessary in special cases@xcite .",
    "in above sections , we have represented the grassmann tensor network wavefunctions under the fock basis . although the fock basis representation is simple and straightforward to derive , however , because of the anticommutating relations for different grassmann numbers , the wavefunctions depend on the ordering the local grassmann tensors @xmath152 and are inconvenient for simulating physical quantities for fermion systems .    in this section",
