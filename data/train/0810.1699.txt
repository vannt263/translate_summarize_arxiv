    "polymer translocation has been found to play a key role in the acquisition of multi - drug resistance to cancer therapy @xcite .",
    "the study of the transport of macromolecules across a nanopore is also important for technological applications .",
    "for example , the development of chemomechanical actuators @xcite , the separation of molecules by liquid chromatography @xcite or fast dna sequencing techniques @xcite are both performed by forcing the molecule to move inside nano - channel devices .",
    "many experimental studies on polymer translocation have been carried out in the wake of the pioneering work of kasianowicz and collaborators ( 1996 ) . in these experiments ,",
    "single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) molecules are forced by a voltage bias to pass through an @xmath0-hemolysin ( @xmath0-hl ) pore imbedded into a membrane .",
    "the passage of the molecule inside the protein channel causes a reduction of the electrolyte ion current and the duration time of any current blockade is recorded . in this way , a linear relationship of the most probable crossing time @xmath1 with the molecule length and an inverse proportionality law between @xmath1 and the applied voltage",

    "the @xmath0-hl channel device has been extensively used for probing the transport dynamics of several types of polynucleotide ( dna or rna ) molecules having same length but different adenine and cytosine contents @xcite .",
    "a different nucleotide composition of the dna brings about a significant change in the distributions of the duration times of the corresponding current drops .",
    "these findings confirm that the dynamics of biopolymer translocation across an @xmath0-hl channel is governed by pore - molecule interactions , which are dependent on the details of dna sequences @xcite , the orientation and the driving voltage @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath2 scales as the inverse square of the temperature and the differences on the crossing time due to different nucleotide compositions are progressively reduced when the temperature increases @xcite .",

    "in contrast to the proportionality law between the translocation time and the polymer length , experiments on the transport dynamics of dna molecules driven inside an entropic trap array have shown longer crossing times for shorter molecules , suggesting the existence of a quasi - equilibrium state of the polymer during the passage @xcite .",

    "the saturation of all the times represents an effect still not completely understood .",
    "a possible explanation could be related to the intrinsic stochastic behavior of the polymer dynamics : large number of monomers gives an average contribution to the motion of the polymer center of mass .",
    "when the number @xmath4 increases , the fluctuations of the single monomer affect less and less the overall motion of the polymer .",
    "this could be considered as a `` coarse - grained '' one - particle description in the limit @xmath81 . moreover , the three characteristic translocation times saturates to almost the same value , indicating that the escaping time probability distributions tend to become more symmetric by increasing the number of monomers",
