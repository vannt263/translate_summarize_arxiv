    "there has recently been a great deal of interest in investigating deformed thermodynamic systems at the classical level .",
    "such deformed theories are believed to deal with the statistical behavior of complex systems , whose underlying dynamics is spanned in a multi - fractal phase - space , governed by long - range interaction and/or long - time memory effects @xcite .",
    "a possible fruitful mechanism capable of generating a deformed version of the classical statistical mechanics consists of replacing , in the boltzmann - gibbs distribution , the standard exponential with its deformed version , accordingly postulating a deformed entropic form which implies a generalized thermostatistics theory . in this manner ,",
    "some noteworthy generalizations of the standard statistical mechanics have been proposed @xcite and their physical consequences are currently under investigation @xcite .    on the other hand , quantum algebra and quantum groups",
    "have been the subject of intensive research in several physical fields from cosmic strings and black holes to the fractional quantum hall effect and high-@xmath2 superconductors @xcite . from the seminal work of biedenharn @xcite and macfarlane @xcite , it was clear that the @xmath0-calculus , originally introduced by heine @xcite and by jackson @xcite in the study of the basic hypergeometric series @xcite , plays a central role in the representation of the quantum groups with a deep physical meaning and not merely a mathematical exercise @xcite . in this context , it was shown in ref.@xcite , that a natural realization of the thermostatistics of @xmath0-deformed bosons and fermions can be built on the formalism of @xmath0-calculus .",
    "furthermore , it is remarkable to observe that the @xmath0-calculus is very well suited for to describe fractal and multifractal systems .",
    "as soon as the system exhibits a discrete - scale invariance , the natural tool is provided by jackson @xmath0-derivative and @xmath0-integral , which constitute the natural generalization of the regular derivative and integral for discretely self - similar systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , it was shown that @xmath0-integral is related to the free energy of spin systems on a hierarchical lattice @xcite .    in the recent past , some tentative to constructing a classical counterpart to the quantum group and @xmath0-deformed dynamics",
    "have been investigated @xcite .",
    "most recently , in @xcite , a @xmath0-deformed poisson bracket has been developed whose underlying algebra arises from the quantum group theory appears to be invariant under the action of the @xmath0-symplectic group .",
    "this generalization implies a classical deformed dynamics and a deformed fokker - planck equation @xcite whose stationary solution can be expressed in terms of the _ basic_-exponential , the @xmath0-analogue of the exponential function in the framework of the basic hypergeometric series ( henceforward , we will use the term _ basic_-exponential and _ basic_-thermostatistics to avoid any confusion with the @xmath0-exponential customarily employed in the tsallis thermostatistics formulation @xcite ) .",
    "the previous investigations raise the interesting question whether the @xmath0-calculus and the _ basic_-exponential can be introduced , as a starting point , for the study of a deformed statistical thermodynamics at the classical level .",
    "just as the quantum @xmath0-deformation plays a crucial role in the interpretation of several complex physical systems , we expect that a classical @xmath0-deformation of the thermostatistics can be relevant in several physical applications .",
    "it is thus worthwhile to investigate the structure of a classical statistical mechanics where the probability distribution function is given by employing the _ basic_-exponential .",
    "this investigation represents the primary goal of this paper .    relating to the previously quoted generalized statistical theories existing in the literature @xcite",
    ", it must be stressed that the deformed exponential functions are very different from the one we are introducing in the present work .",
    "the difference arises mainly in the asymptotic behavior of the _ basic_-exponential which fails to show a power - law tail .",
    "nevertheless , some mathematical peculiarities exhibited by the _",
    "basic_-exponential makes it relevant in the construction of a generalized statistical mechanics .",
    "first among them , the existence of a _ natural _ cut - off in the energy ( velocity ) spectrum which appears to be closely related to the presence of long - range interactions among constituents of the system . to the best of our knowledge , this was first suggested in ref.@xcite in order to overcome the infinity arising in the mass and radius of an isothermal globular cluster .",
    "more recently , concerning several physical systems , there have been many investigations @xcite on the relevance of the presence of an energy cut - off behavior in the particle distribution functions .",
    "finally , we should stress that the _ basic_-exponential introduced in the present work is also employed in the formulation of other interesting generalizations of physical theories such as , for instance , in the @xmath0-deformed schrdinger theory describing the deformed quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite or in the @xmath0-deformed theory of quantum coherence of bosons @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section ii ,",
    "for convenience of the reader , we review the main mathematical properties concerning the quantum algebra of real numbers .",
    "we introduce the _ basic_-exponential by means of a power series and derive its main proprieties which will be used in the formulation of the theory . in section iii",
    ", we introduce the _ basic_-entropy and , by means of a @xmath0-version of the variational principle , we determine the deformed distribution , for each case in turn , of a microcanonical , canonical and grand canonical system .",
    "the thermodynamic structure of the theory is explored in section iv , while in section v , we apply the present formalism to a system of @xmath0-interacting particles whose @xmath1 limit reduces to the free system .",
    "conclusions are reported in section vi and we end the paper with two mathematical appendices .",
    "we shall begin by recalling the main features of the @xmath0-calculus for real numbers .",
    "it is based on the following @xmath0-commutative relation among the operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 with @xmath0 a real and positive parameter . +",
    "a realization of the above algebra in terms of ordinary real numbers can be accomplished by the replacement @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the jackson derivative @xcite defined as @xmath8 its action on an arbitrary real function @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 the jackson derivative satisfies some simple proprieties which will be useful in the following .",

    "( [ taylor ] ) .",
    "+ in the following , we briefly review the main algebraic properties of the _ basic_-exponential useful for our developments .",
    "basic_-exponential is a monotonically increasing function , @xmath34 , convex , @xmath35 , with @xmath36 and reducing to the ordinary exponential in the @xmath1 limit : @xmath37 . + an important property satisfied by the @xmath0-exponential can be written formally as @xcite @xmath38 where the left hand side of eq.([com1 ] ) must be considered by means of its series expansion in terms of _ basic_-binomials : @xmath39 ! } \\ .\\label{expq1}\\ ] ] by observing that @xmath40 for any @xmath41 , since @xmath42 , from eq.([com1 ] ) we obtain @xmath43    from the above relations , we easily deduce that , if @xmath44 , the    series ( [ qexp ] ) converges for all finite values of @xmath45 , otherwise , if @xmath29 the series converges for @xmath46 . + thus , we can summarize the asymptotic behavior of the _ basic_-exponential as @xmath47 where it is important to mention that the first expression of eq.([a2 ] ) defines a cut - off condition of the _ basic_-exponential in the region relevant for our following developments .    among many properties ,",
    "it is important to recall the following relation @xcite @xmath48 and its dual @xmath49 \\ .\\label{dae}\\ ] ] it must be pointed out that eqs.([jde ] ) and ( [ dae ] ) are two important properties of the _ basic_-exponential which turns out to be not true if we employ the ordinary derivative or integral . in particular , from eq.([jde ] ) for @xmath50 , we can obtain the further useful relation @xmath51\\,{\\rm e}_q(x ) \\ .\\label{jde1}\\ ] ] moreover , from eq.([dae ] ) with @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 where @xmath54 in the @xmath44 case , while @xmath55 in the @xmath29 case , accounting for the cut - off condition ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the _",

    "basic_-logarithm @xmath56 , such that @xmath57 which certainly exists because @xmath58 is a strictly monotonic function .",
    "many proprieties of the _ basic_-logarithm follow directly from the corresponding ones of the _ basic_-exponential .",
    "for instance , @xmath56 is a monotonic , increasing and concave function ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) , normalized in @xmath61 and the asymptotic behavior given by @xmath62 although a definition of @xmath56 through a series is possible , it appears to be a nontrivial task to write it in an easy form and , to the best of our knowledge , there are no definitive results in the literature ( see for instance ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we conclude this section by remarking that alternative definitions of the _ basic_-exponential , by means of a different definition of _",

    "our aim is to formulate a statistical mechanics based on the formalism of the @xmath0-algebra and to study its main physical implications .",
    "+ on the basis of the above mathematical framework , it appears natural to generalize the boltzmann entropy to the following form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is probability distribution function labeled by a set of parameters @xmath67 running on the manifold @xmath68 , eventually identified with the phase space , which define the accessible states of the system .",
    "henceforward we adopt units where the boltzmann constant @xmath69 .",
    "+ equation ( [ qent ] ) resembles the well - known boltzmann - gibbs entropy @xmath70 through the replacement of the logarithm with the _ basic_-logarithm .",
    "clearly , the function @xmath71 reduces to the standard entropy @xmath72 in the @xmath1 limit . in the following",
    ", we shall refer to the function ( [ qent ] ) as _ basic_-entropy .    a way to obtain the equilibrium distribution from the entropy @xmath71 , given a set of @xmath73 constraints @xmath74 with @xmath75 ,",

    "this is a substantial different situation with respect to the standard case obtained in the @xmath1 limit where any probability ( differential probability ) is multiplied by an equal ( infinitesimal ) quantities : @xmath101 .",
    "second , the parameter space assumes a fractal structure given by the rule @xmath102 .",
    "we recognize a self - similarity in the parameter space since , starting from any level @xmath103 the same structure @xmath104 is discovered .",
    "+ remarkably , by introducing a set of discrete probability distributions @xmath105 , related to @xmath66 , as @xmath106 equation ( [ norm ] ) becomes @xmath107 clearly , the same considerations hold also in the @xmath29 case . + in order to derive the expression for @xmath66 we introduce the following constrained entropic functional @xmath108\\,d_q\\lambda \\ , \\label{fmicro}\\ ] ] where @xmath109 is the lagrange multiplier associated with eq.([norm ] ) .",
    "+ by inserting the ansatz ( [ ans ] ) in eq.([fmicro ] ) we obtain @xmath110 by evaluating the equation @xmath111 , accounting for eqs.([leib ] ) and ( [ jde ] ) , we obtain @xmath112 the above expression implies the following equation @xmath113 which gives the microcanonical distribution in the form @xmath114 [ we refer to appendix b for a systematic derivation of eq.([mm ] ) ] .",

    "+ we remark that , for @xmath44 all the energy levels @xmath138 can be occupied .",
    "for @xmath29 , however , the distribution ( [ cdis ] ) shows a cut - off in the energy spectrum due to the finite convergence radius of the function @xmath58 .",
    "this is an important consequence of the theory under investigation which limits the number of states accessible to the system .",
    "its origin can be related , as generally accepted , to the presence of interactions among the parts of the system , whose effect is to reduce the volume of the phase space .",
    "this peculiarity is encountered also in other statistics mechanical models based on generalized entropic forms .",
    "+ in particular , eq . ( [ a2 ] ) imposes the following limiting condition on the energy levels @xmath139 , where @xmath140 physically , this means that all the microscopic configurations of the phase space corresponding to an energy @xmath138 beyond @xmath141 are statistically unattainable .",
    "we remark , that @xmath141 is a function of @xmath142 which plays the role of the inverse of a pseudo temperature .",
    "its value is determined through eq.([energy ] ) and it is expected , like in the undeformed theory , that @xmath142 decreases as the mean energy increases .",
    "it means that the cut - off condition plays a relevant role in those _ small _ systems whose mean energy is small compared with the typical energy values of the macroscopic systems .",
    "this is reminiscent of a quantum scenario although our system is a classical one .    in figure 1",
    ", we illustrate the behavior of the basic boltzmann factor @xmath143 for different values of the deformation parameter @xmath0 compared with the classical one given by @xmath144 .",
    "it is observed that for @xmath44 , high energy events are enhanced with respect to the standard case while , for @xmath29 , events are more and more inhibited when energy increases until it reaches the cut - off point , where @xmath145 .",
    "+    in figure 2 , we show the _ basic_-entropy for a system of two levels with probabilities @xmath146 and @xmath147 , respectively , for different values of the deformation parameter .",
    "the dashed line represents the asymptotic curve reached for @xmath148 .",
    "+ again , we stress that such a feature is also shown by other distributions obtained from physically motivated generalizations of the boltzmann - gibbs entropy . for instance",
    ", it can be shown @xcite that for suitably chosen deformation parameters , generalized entropies belonging to the two - parameter family of sharma - mittal @xcite , which include among the others also the well known tsallis entropy @xcite and the rnyi s entropy @xcite , generate probability distribution functions which exhibit a cut - off in their tails .",
    "nevertheless , it is worthwhile to observe that almost all the members belonging to the sharma - mittal family , with some exception like the boltzmann - gibbs entropy and the gaussian entropy , have an asymptotic power law behavior .",
    "this differs substantially from the asymptotic behavior shown by _",
    "basic_-distribution , which is more similar to that of the stretched exponential . in this respect ,",
    "the theory under investigation is not an alternative but complementary to the already existing generalized version of the statistical mechanics , since it can be relevant in the study of those complex systems which are not characterized by an asymptotic free - scale behavior .",
    "finally , let us investigate the grand canonical distribution describing an open system where energy and particles can be exchanged with the surrounding .",

    "if we do not employ the appropriate @xmath0-algebra , the same _ free _ @xmath0-deformed particle distribution ( [ qmb ] ) can be obtained by assuming the following @xmath94-body _ interacting _ hamiltonian @xmath215 this suggests that the effects of the _ basic_-deformation of a _ free_-ideal gas can be viewed as an effective interaction described by the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "we remark that in the @xmath1 limit , the @xmath0-algebra reduces to the ordinary algebra used in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the same hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) reduces to the hamiltonian of a @xmath94-free particles system .",
    "it may be important to clarify this point .",
    "in several papers @xcite , it has been suggested that , starting from a deformed exponential derived through physically and/or mathematically justified arguments , it is possible to introduce a deformed sum in order to reproduce , in a deformed fashion , the well - known multiplicative rule of the standard exponential @xmath216 .",
    "it has been conjectured ( see for instance @xcite ) that such a deformed sum can be employed , on physical grounds , to take into account the complex interactions arising among the many - body colliding particles of a nonlinear medium .",
    "this has been discussed , for instance , explicitly in the tsallis - entropy framework @xcite . in that case in fact , for the deformed sum of the energy values @xmath217 and @xmath218 belonging to two different subsystems a and b , it has been assumed that the expression describes the @xmath0-sum @xmath219 and correspondingly the @xmath0-boltzmann factor factorizes according to @xmath220 the same situation occurs in the kaniadakis - entropy framework @xcite where , by assuming @xmath221 for the energy levels , it has been shown that the @xmath222-boltzmann factor factorizes in @xmath223 of course , all of this can be also reproduced within the formalism employed in the present work .",
    "in fact , we can verify that the following deformed sum @xmath224 which reduces to the ordinary sum in the @xmath1 limit , fulfils the factorization rule @xmath225 for the _ basic_-boltzmann factor .",
    "we easily recognize in the definition ( [ qsum ] ) the origin of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "although it is beyond the scope of the present paper , it is also possible to show that the _ basic_-sum ( [ qsum ] ) obeys all the axiomatic properties where a well defined sum must satisfy associativity , commutativity , existence and uniqueness of the inverse element and of the identity element .",
    "however , by applying the appropriate @xmath0-algebra introduced starting from the @xmath0-binomial expansion , the deformed sum @xmath226 is replaced , in a natural way , by the ordinary sum @xmath227 . this aspect makes the basic thermostatistics formalism very interesting , because of the structure of the considered deformation implies a close and consistent realization in the well known mathematical framework of @xmath0-calculus .",
    "in this paper we have studied a possible generalization of the thermostatistics theory of a classical system based on the @xmath0-deformed algebra .",
    "starting from the definition of the _ basic_-exponential , we have introduced a generalized entropic function and derived , by means of a consistent @xmath0-variational principle , a deformed probability distribution function which differs from the standard gibbs distribution by the replacement of the ordinary exponential function with its generalization furnished by the _",
    "we have performed a preliminary investigation of some fundamental thermodynamic relations which are preserved consistently with the formalism of the @xmath0-calculus .    on physical grounds , it has been demonstrated that the distribution arising in this model exhibits a cut - off in the energy spectrum which is generally expected in those systems whose underlying dynamics is governed by long - range interactions .",
    "such a feature has been observed also in other distributions proposed in the literature , obtained from generalized versions of the boltzamnn - gibbs entropy .",
    "what is different here , is the asymptotic behavior of the distribution derived in this paper which does not match with the power - law behavior typically shown by the other generalized distributions .",
    "we have studied , within the present formalism , a @xmath94-body system of interacting particles described by the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , whose interaction vanishes in the @xmath1 limit . by construction , the canonical distribution function of this system is formally equivalent to the one derived starting from the hamiltonian ( [ ham0 ] ) , describing a system of non - interacting particles , where the momenta obeying the @xmath0-algebra originates from the @xmath0-binomial expansion ( [ qbin ] ) . in this sense , the toy model described by the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) can be considered as the @xmath0-analog of the ideal gas .",
