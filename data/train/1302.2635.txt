    "targeted searches for known pulsars use the radio ephemeris to guide the search and reduce computational expense by assuming the electromagnetic and gravitational wave phases track each other closely .",
    "one search for the crab pulsar allowed for a mismatch of up to one part in @xmath7 between twice the radio pulse frequency and the gravitational wave frequency @xcite . targeted searches for the crab and vela pulsars have set direct upper limits on the wave strain of @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , beating the indirect spin - down limits inferred from radio observations @xcite .",
    "a search of 78 pulsars using data from the third and fourth science runs of the ligo and geo 600 detectors set upper limits on the wave strain @xmath10 and ellipticity @xmath11 , the tightest of which are @xmath12 for psr j1603 - 7202 and @xmath13 for psr j2124 - 3358 @xcite .",
    "blind , all - sky searches address more sources than targeted searches but are expensive computationally as they cover a larger parameter domain to keep track of the unknown frequency evolution .",
    "a number of ligo all - sky searches for periodic sources have been conducted @xcite , some of which leverage the distributed computing power of the einstein@home project @xcite . frequently , they are based on a maximum - likelihood detection statistic , called the @xmath0-statistic@xcite . the @xmath0-statisticis computed by coherently integrating over the observation time @xmath14 , assuming a biaxial neutron star at a specific spin frequency and sky position . @xcite generalized the @xmath0-statisticto apply to multiple detectors and sources .",

    ", we propose a new method for enhancing gravitational wave searches using a second - pass method known as higher criticism .",
    "higher criticism was suggested originally by john tukey and developed further by @xcite , who proved that it has some mathematical optimality properties in the case of a specific noise distribution .",
    "the ultimate goal of any gravitational wave search is to identify an individual object as a definite source .",
    "higher criticism is not suited for this purpose .",
    "it is designed to search against a known background for a group of sparse signals too weak to be detected individually .",
    "higher criticism detects the presence of the group but can not reliably estimate the waveform .",
    "we discuss applications of higher criticism to gravitational wave detection , focusing on the @xmath0-statistic@xcite as a case study . in general , we find that higher criticism is significantly more robust than other methods ; it ignores some information that other detection statistics incorporate , so may be less sensitive , but makes fewer assumptions about the form of the signal , especially important where the signal evolves during the search .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : hc ] , we define the higher criticism statistic , compare the detectability of signals with different amplitudes and sparsities , and compute detection thresholds . in section",
    "[ sec : fstat ] , we briefly review the @xmath0-statistic . in section [ sec :",
    "binary ] , we apply a form of higher criticism to targeted searches for a binary pulsar and compare its performance with the @xmath1-statistic .",
    "we discuss how higher criticism can accommodate phase wandering in section [ sec : wandering ] .",
    "while we apply higher criticism specifically to periodic gravitational wave searches in this paper , it is a general method with other applications , including detecting non - gaussianity in wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data @xcite .",
    "the higher criticism statistic was introduced by @xcite to test the hypothesis that @xmath15 independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "samples @xmath16 come from the same zero - mean gaussian distribution @xmath17 , against the alternative that a small fraction of them have a nonzero mean @xmath18 , that is , to test : @xmath19 for example , @xmath20 could correspond to a situation where all samples are just background noise with no signal ( @xmath21 ) , whereas in @xmath22 a fraction @xmath23 of samples contain signal ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "higher criticism is particularly designed for the very challenging situation where the signal is sparse ( @xmath25 ) and weak ( @xmath26 is so small that the largest extreme values under @xmath22 are essentially the same as those under @xmath20 ) .",
    "although we introduce the statistic in the context of gaussian noise , it can be generalized easily to other distributions ( see section [ sec : generalhc ] ) .",
    "the case of correlated , or non - white , noise has been treated by @xcite .",
    "let @xmath27 denote a random variable with distribution @xmath28 .",

    "however for more general @xmath48 and @xmath15 , this does not work well in practice , as we illustrate in section [ sec : detectthresh ] , where we discuss how to choose @xmath38 accurately as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath48 for finite @xmath15 .",

    "another test has also been considered in the literature , namely the neyman - pearson likelihood ratio test , but it is less attractive since it requires @xmath49 and @xmath50 to be known @xcite , whereas the test based on the higher criticism statistic does not .",
