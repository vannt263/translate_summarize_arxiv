    "in general , we have a choice of variables describing a physical system . in most cases ,",
    "we choose a set of variables whose number is same as the total number of degrees of freedom of the system so as to minimize the number of equations of motion .",
    "however , in some cases , it is quite useful to formulate the system by the use of variables including redundant ones .",
    "a system with gauge symmetry offers a typical example . to describe such a system , keeping the gauge symmetry manifest",
    ", we should employ a formulation that includes redundant variables .",
    "although such a formulation is somewhat complicated , thanks to the symmetry , we can clearly understand the important properties of the system such as conservation laws and form of interactions , and can also calculate physical quantities in a systematic way @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to explore the general features of formulations including redundant degrees of freedom .",
    "here we base this on a principle ( or brief ) that _ physics should be independent of the choice of variables to describe it _ , and make an attempt to formulate hamiltonian systems ( systems of hamiltonian dynamics ) in terms of new sets of variables including redundant ones .",
    "what kind of dynamics describes the time evolution of the new variables ?",
    "our strategy and conjecture are as follows .",
    "consider a hamiltonian system described by a canonical doublet @xmath0 .",
    "take @xmath1 variables @xmath2 that are functions of the canonical doublet , and deal with them as fundamental variables to describe the system . if they contain redundant variables , constraints between some variables must be induced . to handle the constraints ,",
    "dirac formalism @xcite provides a helpful perspective , where constraints with lagrange multipliers are added to the original hamiltonian .",
    "the induced constraints play a similar role to the hamiltonian . as for the dynamics of @xmath3 variables ,",
    "nambu mechanics @xcite is quite suggestive . in nambu mechanics , fundamental variables",
    "form an @xmath3-plet , whose time evolution is generated by @xmath4 hamiltonians according to the nambu equations . combining the advantages of the two theories , we conjecture that _ there is a formulation whose master equation has a form of the nambu equation or its generalization , where the hamiltonians consist of the original one and the induced constraints .",
    "_    nambu mechanics is a generalization of the hamiltonian dynamics proposed by nambu forty years ago @xcite . in his formulation , the dynamics of an @xmath3-plet",
    "is given by the nambu equation , which is defined by @xmath4 hamiltonians and the nambu bracket , a generalization of the poisson bracket .",
    "the structure of nambu mechanics is so elegant that many authors have investigated its application .",
    "however , the applications have been limited to particular systems such as constrained systems , superintegrable systems , and hydrodynamic systems , because nambu systems ( systems of nambu mechanics ) should have multiple hamiltonians or conserved quantities .",
    "for example , researchers have studied how nambu mechanics can be embedded into constrained hamiltonian systems @xcite or how constrained systems can be described in terms of nambu mechanics @xcite .    in this article , we show that the structure of nambu mechanics is , in general , hidden in systems of hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "that is , hamiltonian systems can be described by nambu mechanics or its generalization by means of a change of variables from canonical doublets to multiplets .",
    "our formulation can be generalized to many degrees of freedom systems , and the associated partition functions are given .",
    "we also apply our formulation to systems with first class constraints .",
    "our approach can be regarded as a complementary one to the previous works @xcite .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we give a formulation of hamiltonian systems using nambu mechanics and its generalizations . as an application ,",

    "3 . in the last section , we give conclusions and discussions on the direction of future work . in appendix",

    "our formulation is not just a change of description , but gives a new insight into the statistical or quantum mechanical treatment of hamiltonian systems .",
