    "this eigenvalue is unique for @xmath11 sufficiently small , and the corresponding eigenfunction behaves like @xmath18 .",
    "the case @xmath19 has been studied in  @xcite , and corresponds to a _",
    "semiclassical _ scaling .",
    "in particular , dimassi shows that the number of negative eigenvalues grows as @xmath20 and satisfies a weyl type asymptotics .",
    "although the method therein relies on the use of an effective hamiltonian , it is not clear how to relate this effective hamiltonian to an effective potential , even in our one - dimensional setting .",
    "here we aim at studying the case @xmath21 in a unified manner .",
    "we find it convenient to first rescale our problem : let @xmath22 , @xmath23 and ( abusing notations ) @xmath24 , @xmath25",
    ". then the eigenproblem   reads @xmath26 from now on , we shall only focus on the eigenproblem   rather than  .",
    "let us describe how the effective potential may be extracted from the knowledge of @xmath10 .",
    "consistently with homogenization techniques , we introduce the auxiliary cell operator @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a fixed parameter . for @xmath29",
    "sufficiently small , we can ( and will ) prove that there exists a unique negative eigenvalue , @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the unique zero - mean solution to @xmath33 we then show that @xmath34 acts as an _ effective potential _ , in the sense that the asymptotic behavior of the low - lying spectrum of our original operator , @xmath35 , may be described through the one of the non - oscillatory effective operator : @xmath36 in the _ whole _ paper , we work under the following assumption .",

    "thereafter , we denote @xmath41    denote @xmath42 be the @xmath43 ( necessarily simple ) eigenvalue of @xmath44 counted increasingly , and @xmath45 afterwards .",
    "define similarly @xmath46 through the eigenvalues of @xmath47 .",

    "there are three different regimes at stake :    1 .",

    "the low - lying spectrum of   is dictated by a _",
    "weak coupling limit_. since the effective potential has negative mass , there exists for @xmath29 sufficiently small a unique negative eigenvalue , at a distance @xmath58 of the origin ; 3 .   in this regime",

    "theorem [ th.main-result-eigenvalues ] shows that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath42 follows the one of @xmath56 provided that the spectral gap is asymptotically smaller than @xmath61 .",
    "this generically occurs for @xmath62 . in that case",
    ", the effective potential also allows to describe asymptotically the behavior of the corresponding eigenfunctions as we shall see in the following propositions .",

    "[ fig.alpha=2 ] ,  [ fig.alpha=05 ] and  [ fig.alpha=1 ] , below , we plot eigenfunctions of @xmath44 in the three different regimes , and compare them with the approximations involved in our results , _",
    "i.e. _ the eigenfunction of the effective operator , @xmath97 , and its asymptotic approximation namely @xmath98 in the semiclassical regime , and @xmath99 in the weak coupling regime ) .",
    "the numerical scheme used for computing the eigenfunctions is described in appendix  [ sec.numerics ] .",
    "we defined the oscillatory potential by @xmath100 ( see figure  [ fig.q ] ) , so that @xmath101 the value of the parameters are @xmath102 , and @xmath103 ( semiclassical regime ) , @xmath104 ( weak coupling regime ) and @xmath88 ( critical regime ) .",
    "a striking observation on these numerical experiments is that , as suggested in propositions  [ prop.semiclassical ] ,  [ prop.small-amplitude ] and  [ prop.critical ] , the main source of imprecision arises when approximating the eigenfunction of the effective problem , @xmath105 with its semiclassical or weak coupling asymptotics , @xmath106 .",
    "notice however that , in our results , the estimates between the exact and effective eigenfunctions is still much less precise than the eigenvalue approximation , due to the smallness of the spectral gap . as a matter of fact",
    ", the crudeness of the former estimates hides a finer structure for the eigenfunctions , suggested by our proof : we show that @xmath107 notice the above shows three different scales , as the scaling involved in @xmath108 is different form the ones involved by @xmath109 , unless @xmath88 . in particular , oscillations are localized on a smaller region than the one defined by the eigenfunction in the weak coupling regime , in contrast with the semiclassical regime .",
    "although the precision of our results is insufficient to demonstrate this three - scale structure , the latter is fully supported by our numerical simulations .",
    "indeed , had we plotted @xmath110 in figures  [ fig.alpha=2 ] ,  [ fig.alpha=05 ] and  [ fig.alpha=1 ] , then its graph would have been superimposed with the one of the exact eigenfunction .",
    "let us now briefly discuss the relation of our results with the existing literature .      the problem of describing the large scale behavior of partial differential equations with periodically oscillating coefficients on a small scale is often tackled by the so - called homogenization process .",
    "our approach is closely related , as can be seen in particular from the use of an auxiliary `` cell '' problem for describing the effective behavior .",
    "notice however that our problem involves three scales whereas standard works based on homogenization techniques typically involve only two scales , as in the case @xmath59 or @xmath88 .",
    "this transpires for instance in  @xcite where , in order to deal with large potentials , the authors introduce a _",
    "factorization principle _ which is similar to our normal form transformation ( see below ) , although without the change of variable .",
    "we would also like to mention the recent works @xcite , where similar multiscale problem as ours are studied .",
    "the derivation of the effective operator @xmath97 from the initial operator @xmath44 is reminiscent of the famous born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "this method of dimensional reduction , that is a quantum averaging strategy , was initially introduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite in relation with molecular physics ) and has been developed in many different contexts ( see for instance the review @xcite ) , and in particular to derive spectral asymptotic results ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us explain the analogy .",
    "consider the two - dimensional operator @xmath111 acting on @xmath112 with @xmath10 satisfying the same assumptions as above .",
    "this operator is formally obtained by introducing a fictitious variable @xmath113 and duplicating the second derivative . using the rescaling @xmath114",
    ", we are reduced to the unitarily equivalent operator : @xmath115 this operator is in the born - oppenheimer form : it is partially semiclassical with respect to the variable @xmath116 and @xmath117 can be interpreted as an operator - valued potential .",
    "it can be proved in a rather general framework ( see for instance @xcite in the context of pseudo - differential operators ) that , generically , the low - lying spectrum is well described by the one of the reduced operator @xmath118 though the context is different , this general strategy will serve as a rough guideline for our study .",
    "however , note that we will have to overcome the fact that the variables @xmath116 and @xmath113 are not independent .",
    "let us describe the key elements of the proof of our results .",
    "the main idea is a _ normal form _ transformation .",
    "we show that the contributions of the oscillatory potential @xmath119 may be factorized thanks to a two - scale function @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is constructed as a quasimode for the two - dimensional operator @xmath122 the first step of the construction of @xmath121 consists in studying the groundstate of the cell operator @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is now a parameter , and the effective potential arises as the leading order of the lowest eigenvalue , @xmath125 . the construction and asymptotic behavior of @xmath121",

    "theorem  [ th.main-result-eigenvalues ] quickly follows from the min - max principle .",
    "we then deduce the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues in the three aforementioned regimes .    in section [ sec.eigenfunctions ] , we use again the normal form of our operator to construct quasimodes .",
    "we detail in section  [ sec.semiclassical ] ( respectively section  [ sec.small-amplitude ] and section  [ sec.critical ] ) the semiclassical regime , @xmath126 ( respectively weak coupling regime , @xmath127 and critical regime , @xmath88 ) . the spectral theorem , together with the previously obtained results on the eigenvalues , allows to deduce the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding eigenfunctions , as stated above .",
