    "since the discovery of the first pulsar , radio observations have steadily revealed a wide range of fast ( @xmath1s ) transient phenomena .",
    "pulsars @xcite , planets and active stars @xcite , and peculiar new transients @xcite all have distinct radio phenomenology related to the physics of the host and the medium through which the signal propagates .",
    "while large , single - dish telescopes have pioneered the study of fast radio transients , the nature of their design has several limits .",
    "single - dish telescopes can only localize an individual pulse to somewhere in its field of view ( typically arcminutes ; * ? ? ?",
    "timing of periodic emission can localize very precisely , but individual pulses ca nt be localized well enough to easily identify optical or x - ray counterparts . since interferometers simultaneously have a large collecting area and a large field of view , they survey more efficiently than single - dish telescopes .",
    "survey speed scales roughly the square of the product of the number of dishes and their diameter ; this predicts that the vla surveys almost 40 times faster than the green bank telescope , assuming all other factors are equal . despite this potential ,",
    "next - generation radio interferometers ( vla , paper , lofar , askap , and meerkat ) have fast transients observing modes that are essentially identical to the single - dish concept : point one or more beams on the sky and search for pulses @xcite .    in principle , interferometers have much more information available to them because they detect the electromagnetic wave over a distributed array of receivers . instead of forming a beam , interferometers can measure visibilities by correlating signals across the array .",
    "visibilities contain spatial information that can reject interference and localize a source to _ arcsecond _ precision over a large field of view .",
    "traditionally , visibilities havent been used in this way because it was difficult to run correlators this fast and the data volume was too large to handle or efficiently search for pulses @xcite . as a result , a standard radio interferometer averages data to second time scales , losing nearly all information about millisecond variability in the sky .",
    "even on these longer time scales , imaging algorithms are complex and subject to subtle statistical biases @xcite .",
    "the challenge of data rates and volumes is expected to grow with next - generation interferometers , which will have more antennas , wider bandwidths , and larger fields of view @xcite .    here",
    ", we present a technique that reduces the challenge of detecting transients in visibilities to the much simpler single - dish problem , while maintaining the utility of visibilities . the technique is based on the `` bispectrum '' , a quantity formed from visibilities that is sensitive to a point source anywhere in the field of view @xcite .",
    "differencing visibilities makes it possible to interpret the bispectrum as a statistic for transients anywhere in the field of view on time scales from milliseconds to seconds .",
    "we describe an algorithm for real - time , arcsecond localization of transients using raw visibilities from a radio interferometer .",
    "the theory of closure quantities and their application to transients is presented in  [ theory ] . in ",
    "[ demo ] we test the theoretical predictions with millisecond time scale visibilities from the vla and the `` pocket correlator '' ( poco ) instrument at the ata @xcite . as shown in  [ demand ] , this technique has a moderate computational demand and can reduce the flow of data to a manageable size .",
    "we conclude with thoughts about new science accessible with this technique and how it can address the growing challenge of big data in the study of transients with radio interferometers .",
    "closure quantities are the combination of visibilities from antennas that form a closed loop @xcite .",
    "an example of a closure quantity is the closure phase or triple phase , which is the sum of the visibility phase from three baselines , @xmath2 .",
    "this combination is useful because it is independent of phase errors associated with any individual antenna .",
    "closure quantities have largely been developed for very long baseline interferometry , because they make it possible to detect a source even if phase calibration is unstable @xcite .",
    "an interesting corollary is that the triple phase responds in the same way to a point source anywhere in the field of view .",
    "a related closure quantity is the product of visibilities on a closed loop , called the closure triple or bispectrum .",
    "the bispectrum can be written as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are the amplitudes of visibilities for baseline @xmath5 . in the absence of signal ,",
    "the bispectra have a mean at the origin of the real - imaginary plane with variance proportional to the cube of the thermal noise .",
    "a celestial point source is coherent across the array and moves all bispectra to positive real values proportional to the cube of its brightness @xcite .",
    "this makes the bispectrum useful for the statistical detection of a source anywhere in the field of view .",
    "an interferometer can detect sources with a low signal to noise ratio ( snr ) per baseline , @xmath6 , by coherently combining signals over many baselines . for a homogeneous array of @xmath7 elements",
    ", there are @xmath8  independent baselines , so coherently combining all baselines improves snr to @xmath9 . for combinations of three antennas ,",
    "there are @xmath10  closed possibilities .",
    "it can be shown that some triple phases are redundant ( e.g. , @xmath11 ) , which leaves only @xmath12 `` unique '' triples @xcite .",
    "however , the bispectrum is subject to different correlated noise properties , since it is formed by multiplying complex visibilities rather than summing scalar phases . as a result , in the limit of small @xmath6 ,",
    "all @xmath13  triples are independent @xcite and can be coherently combined to improve snr .",
    "interferometers can detect a source in many ways .",
    "coherent beamforming sums complex visibilities with weights to direct the beam .",
    "antenna - based incoherent beamforming sums the power detected at each antenna , while baseline - based beamforming sums power detected on each baseline ( i.e. , the amplitude of a visibility ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in all of these cases ,",
    "the snr of a source detection can be written in terms of the snr per baseline and size of the array @xcite .",
    "the snr for coherent beamforming , bispectrum , antenna - based incoherent beamforming , and baseline - based incoherent beamforming are : @xmath14 note that for constant sources , the relation for snr@xmath15  is only valid when @xmath6  is smaller than 1 @xcite .",
    "however , for transient sources the noise is measured off pulse .",
    "this removes the correlated noise effect and makes the @xmath16  scaling valid for all @xmath6 .",
    "we refer to these relations as the `` apparent snr '' , since they are valid when the statistics are measured relative to the standard deviation off source . for gaussian statistics ,",
    "the apparent snr is related to the false positive rate as @xmath17 @xcite ; a @xmath18  deviation corresponds to a false - positive rate of @xmath19 .",
    "an important complication to this snr analysis is that an individual bispectrum measurement is not gaussian distributed .",
    "visibilities are gaussian distributed , so multiplying three , noise - like complex visibilities together produces a long - tailed distribution .",
    "the product of three independent _ real_-valued random variables follows the meier g function g@xmath20 @xcite ; we are not aware of an analytic expression for the real part of the product of three _ complex _ random variables .",
    "regardless of the exact distribution , the central limit theorem predicts that the mean of many , independent bispectra will approach a gaussian distribution @xcite . in the presence of pure noise ,",
    "each bispectrum in an array is independent @xcite , so the distribution of the mean bispectrum will approach a gaussian as the number of elements in the array grows , as shown in figure [ disn ] .",
    "antennas producing @xmath21  independent visibilities .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the visibilities are sampled from a gaussian with standard deviation of 1 and mean of 0 .",
    "the mean bispectrum for @xmath22  ( the smallest array with a bispectrum ) is centrally peaked with long tails . for larger arrays , the distribution of the mean bispectrum narrows and approaches that of a gaussian , as expected from the central limit theorem .",
    "the distribution can also be used to estimate the false - positive rate for a signal of a given apparent snr .",
    "[ disn],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to include this effect in our sensitivity calculation , we simulated noise - like visibilities and directly measured the flux limit of the coherent beamforming and bispectrum statistics as a function of array size , @xmath7 .",
    "the flux limit is quantified by calculating @xmath6  ( from equations [ snreqn ] ) that would produce the simulated 5@xmath0  false - positive rate under gaussian statistics .",
    "this simulation shows that the flux limit of coherent beamforming matches the expectation for a gaussian - distributed quantity .",
    "however , the mean bispectrum has a larger false - positive rate than expected for an apparent 5@xmath0  deviation , especially for small @xmath7 where the central limit theorem has less effect .",
    "we use these simulations to define an effective bispectrum 5@xmath0  flux limit that produces the gaussian false - positive rate .",
    "the effective 5@xmath0  flux limit is higher than predicted by gaussian statistics at a level of 53% , 26% , 13% , and 6% for @xmath23 , respectively . for this work",
    ", we assume the mean bispectrum is gaussian distributed , which is reasonable for arrays larger than a roughly a dozen elements for a 5@xmath0  flux limit .",
    "future work will develop a more general expression for the false - positive rate and optimizations for transient detection in the non - gaussian domain .",
    "flux limits as a function of the number of antennas .",

    "[ snrtheory],scaledwidth=55.0% ]    figure [ snrtheory ] shows how the apparent snr of four techniques scales with snr per baseline for a 27-element array like the vla .",
    "the apparent bispectrum snr scales as @xmath16 , giving it a strong response to bright sources and very little response to faint sources . however , the effective bispectrum snr , defined according to a gaussian false - positive rate , would be less sensitive for large @xmath6 .",
    "our simulations suggest that the effective bispectrum snr never exceeds that of coherent beamforming .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ snrtheory ] shows the effective 5@xmath0  flux limit for an array with @xmath7  elements and sensitivity like the vla . for the beamforming techniques ,",
    "this plot essentially shows how the lines in the top panel intersect @xmath24  as the array size changes . for the bispectrum ,",
    "the effective flux limit is shown by correcting for sensitivity loss due to non - gaussianity , as measured in our simulations . generally ,",
    "since large arrays are sensitive to pulses with snr per baseline much less than one , coherent beamforming and imaging become more sensitive than the bispectrum as @xmath7  increases . for large @xmath7 ,",
    "the bispectrum and incoherent beamforming techniques scale similarly ( @xmath25 ) , so the bispectrum is always more sensitive than the incoherent techniques .    to interpret the bispectrum as the brightness of a transient requires subtracting the signature of constant emission from the visibilities .",
    "proper subtraction requires that the visibility fringe does not change over background subtraction time .",
    "the maximum fringe rate is equal to the product of the rate of change of the longest baseline in the ( _ u , v _ ) plane and the largest direction cosine . in units of radians per day ,",
    "the maximum fringe rate is @xmath26 , where @xmath27  is the longest baseline , @xmath28  is the field of view in radians , and @xmath29  is the wavelength .",
    "more precisely , the error from subtracting visibilities leaves residual errors proportional to the brightness of sources in the field .",
    "@xcite quantify the effect of time smearing as a reduction in the peak brightness of a source .",
    "for small changes , we can parametrize this in terms of a 1.4 ghz vla a configuration observation : @xmath30 ^ 2 \\label{bgerr}\\ ] ] where @xmath31  is the integration time scale .    for visibility ( or image )",
    "subtraction , the peak flux lost from time smearing is similar to the flux residual in the differenced data given by equation [ bgerr ] . this error will contribute to the mean bispectrum in proportion to the fraction of all triples that contain the long baseline .",
    "a single antenna is part of @xmath12  triples , so errors for a long baseline are suppressed by the fraction of triples with that baseline , or a factor of @xmath32 .",
    "table [ sub ] gives the longest time scale for which the bispectrum technique can be used on several radio interferometers .",
    "the time scale shows when the systematic errors introduced by background subtraction biases the mean bispectrum more than its thermal noise ( 1@xmath0 ) .",
    "this shows that most interferometers are suitable for using the bispectrum technique to search for transients as long as 1 second .",
    "the vlba is so extended that the fringe rate can only be subtracted on millisecond time scales .",
    "the bispectrum also contains information about the spatial distribution of emission . for a point source with large @xmath6 ,",
    "the standard deviation of complex bispectra is @xmath33 , where @xmath34  is the noise per baseline @xcite .",
    "note that the standard deviation of bispectra _ is _ subject to correlated noise , as opposed to the standard deviation of the mean bispectrum in time .",
    "in contrast with a celestial source , interference is often in the near - field or subject to multipath propagation , which produces a random triple phase and a larger variance between bispectra .",
    "another way to think about this is that terrestrial interference can look like a spatially - extended transient .",
    "the variance between bispectra provides a simple way to quantify whether a transient is point - like , as expected .",
    "to use the bispectrum for transient detection , we assume that the real part of the mean of all bispectra is related to the brightness of a single source in the field of view . to use the bispectrum to detect and",
    "localize pulses , we propose the following algorithm :    * * subtract the mean visibility in time : * differencing visibilities removes all constant emission over some time scale , @xmath31 . *",
    "* dedisperse visibilities : * the frequency - dependent arrival time must be removed to maximize snr per baseline before creating the bispectra . * * calculate mean and standard deviation of bispectra : * the mean of bispectra gives a single value related to the significance of the transient , while the standard deviation is related to its spatial structure .",
    "both the mean and standard deviation have dimensions of dm and time , so they can be used to set thresholds just as for a single - dish transients search . * * calibrate and image candidate pulses : * bispectra can be used to make an image , but calibrated visibilities are needed for an accurate localization @xcite .",
    "visibilities need to be buffered long enough to capture the dispersive delay across the band .",
    "the pulse is then imaged in a separate process .",
    "figure [ snr ] shows how the bispectrum and coherent beamforming techniques detect pulses in poco data toward b0329 + 54 .",
    "for both techniques , the plot shows the apparent pulse snr when the pulsar is at the phase center , away from the phase center , and at the phase center but uncalibrated .",

    "another strength of the bispectrum technique is its computationally efficiency . table [ comp ]",
    "shows how the computational demand scales for three coherent fast transient detection techniques at the vla .",
    "these computational demand values are scaled to operations per second ( flops ) by multiplying by the integration rate in hz . for the bispectrum and imaging techniques ,",
    "the visibilities are dedispersed for each baseline and dm trial , while coherent beamforming is traditionally done before dedispersion .",
    "the imaging fft requires @xmath40  operations per image @xcite . for the vla d configuration ,",

    "the bispectrum technique is the most computationally efficient technique for coherent pulse detection . running this algorithm on 10 ms integrations at the vla",
    "would require roughly 34 gflops .",
    "imaging is at least two times more demanding ( this estimate excludes image cleaning ) .",
    "the coherent beamforming is driven by the number of beams needed to fill the field of view . even in the compact d configuration ,",
    "roughly 7000 beams are needed .",
    "the vla a configuration would require about 900 times more synthesized beams and 3 pflops to calculate .",
    "the large computational demand of coherent beamforming explains why it is typically only done with a few beams @xcite .",
    "our pulse detection algorithm consists of many independent processes ( across frequency , dm trial , and time ) , so the problem is readily parallelized .",
    "moreover , aspects of the algorithm , such as the large number of multiplications and dedispersion , are well suited to gpus @xcite .",
    "table [ comp ] suggests that the bispectrum computational demand can be met with a single gpu - accelerated server .",
    "however , the data rate associated with millisecond integrations from a large array can limit its application for some correlator designs , so careful attention must be paid to data rate bottlenecks .",
    "for example , at the vla , the visibility integration time must be greater than roughly 10 ms , since nodes of the widar compute cluster have 1 gbe input ports @xcite . a correlator that can produce visibilities at high (",
    "@xmath42  gb s@xmath43 ) data rates is more likely to be limited by computational resources , driven largely by the need to dedisperse visibilities from each baseline . in this case",
    ", it will be easier to run this algorithm in real time on arrays with a small number of elements .",
    "this description has focused on how the bispectrum can detect an astrophysical transient , but it ca nt be used to localize it . while the bispectrum can be used to make images of the sky @xcite , precise localization requires external phase calibration .",
    "thus , the final step in this algorithm is to save candidate transient data for calibration and imaging using traditional techniques @xcite .",
    "this kind of post - processing is computationally more intensive than the bispectrum and is not feasible in real time on every integration .",
    "however , since we only need to calibrate and image the occasional candidate event , the total computational demand will still be dominated by the steps before the event detection .",
    "we demonstrate how to use the bispectrum to detect and localize transients with radio interferometers .",
    "the technique produces a single statistic proportional to the brightness of celestial transients , thus reducing the problem of interferometric pulse detection to that of single - dish pulse detection . for a small cost in sensitivity",
    ", this technique makes an interferometer into a massive multibeam receiver with a proportionately large survey speed .",
    "using coherent beamforming to survey a similar area with next - generation radio interferometers would require @xmath44  to @xmath45  times more computational power .",
    "the bispectrum technique is efficient enough to build into a correlator for real - time , millisecond transient detection .",
    "this system could save visibility data associated with a candidate and apply standard calibration and imaging techniques to localize it to arcsecond precision .",
    "the growing capacity of correlators for interferometers will make it possible to run such a system in real time to commensally search all data for transients .",
    "the technique can also be used to find transients offline and on longer time scales . in that case , the bispectrum is useful because it is computationally simple , resistant to interference , and requires no calibration .    a real - time , commensal system would probe an unprecedented volume of data , giving it sensitivity to rare transients .",
    "each pulse could be localized in real time to arcsecond precision , opening a range of new science .",
    "pulses from rotating radio transients @xcite could be associated with x - ray counterparts to help address their relation to the normal pulsar population .",
    "the dispersion of extragalactic transients would measure the electron density of the intergalactic medium for the first time @xcite ; localization will help find optical counterparts and redshifts to host galaxies for each pulse .",
    "a fast transients survey of the galactic center could detect individual pulses from pulsars that would probe the dispersion toward the region and potentially find a pulsar in orbit around a supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "magnetospheres of exoplanets and active stars can emit bright , complex bursts that could uniquely identify them @xcite .",
