    "the axion @xcite in the mass range @xmath2 is one of the most promising candidates for the non - baryonic dark matter in the universe @xcite .",
    "the search for dark matter axions is , however , a quite difficult task due to their extremely weak interactions with ordinary matter .",
    "the basic idea for dark matter axion search is to convert axions into microwave photons in a resonant cavity under a strong magnetic field via primakoff process , as originally proposed by sikivie @xcite .",
    "pioneering experiments were made before with amplification - heterodyne - method @xcite .",
    "recently , some results of an advanced experiment by the us group have been reported , excluding the ksvz axion with mass @xmath3 as the dark matter in the halo of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "we have proposed a quite efficient scheme for dark matter axion search , where rydberg atoms are utilized to detect the axion - converted photons @xcite .",
    "then , based on this scheme we have developed ultra - sensitive rydberg - atom - cavity detectors , carrack i and ii ( cosmic axion research with rydberg atoms in resonant cavities in kyoto ) @xcite .",
    "we here report on the present progress in development of the dark matter axion search experiment with rydberg - atom - cavity detectors .",
    "the axion search in the mass range @xmath4 , about 8 % around @xmath0 , has been performed with the prototype detector carrack i. then , based on the performance of carrack i , the new large - scale apparatus carrack ii is now ready for the axion search in the wide mass range @xmath1 .",
    "the principle of the present experimental method is schematically shown as follows .",

    "these axion - converted photons are transferred to the detection cavity , and interact with rydberg atoms passed through the cavity due to the electric dipole transition @xmath8 providing the collective atom - photon coupling @xmath9 .",
    "the rydberg atoms are initially prepared to the lower state @xmath10 .",
    "then , the atoms excited to the upper state @xmath11 by absorbing the axion - converted photons are detected quite efficiently with the selective field ionization method @xcite after exiting the cavity .",
    "the background noise in this method is predominantly brought by the thermal photons in the cavity which can also excite the rydberg atoms .",
    "it can be reduced substantially by cooling the whole apparatus down to about @xmath12 , attaining a significant signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "therefore , the rydberg - atom - cavity detector , which is free from the amplifier noise by itself , is expected to be quite sensitive for the dark matter axion search .",
    "the layout of the actual apparatus , carrack ii , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : carrackii ] .",
    "it mainly consists of 6 parts ; superconducting magnets , coupled cavities ( conversion and detection ) , dilution refrigerator , atomic beam system , laser excitation system and selective field ionization ( sfi ) system .",
    "the magnet system consists of 2 superconducting solenoid coils .",
    "one is the main coil which can produce the magnetic flux density of @xmath13 at the center .",
    "the other is the cancellation coil which is set at the lower side of the main coil to reduce the magnetic field in the region of the detection cavity to less than @xmath14 ( the critical magnetic flux density of superconducting niobium is @xmath15 ) .",
    "the conversion cavity is made of oxygen - free high - conductivity copper .",
    "the detection cavity and the sfi housing are made of niobium to prevent the penetration of the magnetic field into the inside of these area .",
    "this is to avoid complicated level splitting and shift due to zeeman effect to the atoms .",
    "the cavity mode is the cylindrical @xmath16 mode and the cavity resonant frequency is tuned over 25 % by the metal and aluminum - oxide posts @xcite .",
    "the transition frequency of the rydberg atom should approximately coincide with the resonant frequency of the cavity .",
    "it is tuned roughly by choosing a state with appropriate principal quantum number @xmath17 , and finely by applying an electric field with stark electrodes in the detection cavity .",
    "the atoms in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 states are stark shifted as @xmath20 with a certain constant @xmath21 and the applied electric field @xmath22 .",
    "we have measured the scaler polarizability @xmath23 of the relevant levels for a wide range of @xmath17 ( 60 to 150 ) and hence obtained detailed systematic information on this tuning .",
    "the dilution refrigerator ( oxford kelvinox 300 ) is used to cool the cavity system down to the low enough temperature @xmath24 .",
    "we use two kind of atomic beam source systems .",
    "one consists of an ion source and a charge exchange cell ; atoms are ionized once and after accelerated , they are neutralized in the charge exchange cell to get higher - velocity atomic beam with kinetic energy @xmath25 . in the other system ,",
    "a thermal atomic oven is used to get lower - velocity atomic beam with @xmath26 . as discussed later",
    ", the atomic velocity should be changed roughly proportional to the axion mass in order to attain the optimal sensitivity .",
    "hence , with these two systems a wide range of the atomic beam velocity can be covered to meet the need from the experimental situation .",
    "the rydberg states are produced with 2-step laser system . at the first step ,",
    "atoms are excited from the ground state to @xmath27 state by a diode laser with wavelength @xmath28 , and then to @xmath29 state ( @xmath30 ) by a ring dye laser .",
    "the wavelength of the ring dye laser is varied from @xmath31 to @xmath32 depending on the axion mass .",
    "the ring dye laser is pumped by a kripton ion laser .",
    "the transition from the @xmath29 state to the @xmath33 or @xmath34 state is used to absorb the axion - converted photons .",
    "the atoms excited to the upper state by absorbing microwave photons are selectively ionized by applying a pulsed electric field . by taking an appropriate slew rate of the pulsed electric field , the difference of the ionization field values between the upper and lower atomic states becomes large enough .",
    "this enables us to ionize selectively the upper state with quite good efficiency @xcite .",
    "the rydberg - atom - cavity detector is an ultra - sensitive single - photon counter . in the theoretical point of view , it is treated as a quantum system of interacting oscillators with dissipation which represent appropriately the axions , photons and atoms in the cavity .",
    "we have developed quantum theoretical calculations on the axion - photon - atom system in the resonant cavity in order to estimate precisely the detection sensitivity for dark matter axions @xcite .",
    "these calculations are made by taking into account appropriately the actual experimental situations such as the motion and uniform distribution of rydberg atoms in the incident beam as well as the spatial variation of the electric field in the cavity .",
    "we here recapitulate the essential results , and show how the relevant experimental parameters should be adjusted to attain the optimal sensitivity .",
    "the characteristic properties of axions , photons and atoms are listed as @xmath35 the relevant experimental parameters are also given as @xmath36 these parameter values are optimum for the dark matter axion search as shown below .    in order to estimate the sensitivity for the dark matter axions , we need to calculate the counting rates of the excited atoms per unit time at the exit of cavity which are due to the axion - converted photons and the thermal background photons , respectively .",

    "r_n = v { \\bar \\rho}_b^ { [ \\gamma ] } ( l ) .\\ ] ] the resonant absorption of the microwave photons by the rydberg atoms is determined by the atomic damping rate as well as the atomic transition frequency fine - tuned with stark effect .",
    "it should be noted that the effective atomic damping rate may be larger than the original one @xmath41 due to the collective atom - photon coupling @xmath9 and the finite atomic transit time @xmath42 , which are given by @xmath43 the effective atomic width is roughly estimated as @xmath44 in the weak region of atomic beam intensity @xmath45 providing small enough @xmath9 , the signal and noise rates increase with @xmath46 .",
    "then , for certain beam intensity @xmath47 , where the condition @xmath48 is satisfied with @xmath49 the signal rate is maximized to be @xmath50 , and the noise rate almost reaches the asymptotic value @xmath51 .",
    "these counting rates in the optimum case are roughly estimated as @xmath52 which are proportional to the number of axions and the number of thermal photons , respectively .",
    "the effective axion - photon coupling in the resonant cavity under the strong magnetic field is calculated from the original @xmath7 coupling @xcite as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the volume and form factor of the cavity system , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : th - exp ] , we show the theoretical estimates of the signal rate @xmath56 ( solid ) and noise rate @xmath57 ( dashed ) .",
    "the signal and noise rates really exhibit the characteristic behaviors with respect to the atomic beam intensity as mentioned above .",
    "the preliminary experimental data of the thermal photon noise ( dots with error bars ) are also presented for comparison .",
    "the theoretical estimates are indeed in good agreement with the experimental data being proportional to the number of thermal photons @xmath58 .",
    "this indicates that the thermal photon noise provides an efficiency calibration for the rydberg - atom - cavity detector .",
    "specifically , the optimum beam intensity for the dark matter axion search can be determined rather accurately by detecting the thermal photon noise .",
    "the signal rate is in fact maximized where the noise rate turns to be saturated .",
    "the sensitivity for the axion search at @xmath59 level is estimated with the signal and noise rates @xmath60 and @xmath61 . the one - step measurement time and the total scanning time over a 10 % frequency range",
    "are calculated respectively by @xmath62 we have estimates at @xmath63 level for the dfsz axion with mass around @xmath0 , @xmath64 by taking the relevant experimental parameter values as listed so far .",
    "the sensitivity is of course much better for the ksvz axion .",
    "we have made so far extensive research and development in the dark matter axion search with rydberg - atom - cavity detector .    in the theoretical part , we have developed the quantum theoretical formulations and calculations for the axion - photon - atom interaction in the resonant cavity .",
    "they provide the precise estimate of the sensitivity for the dark matter axions , specifying the optimum setup for the relevant experimental parameters such as the atomic beam velocity and intensity .",
    "then , by using these calculations we can determine the bound on the axion - photon - photon coupling @xmath7 from the experimental data .",
    "experimentally , we have searched for the dark matter axions in the mass range @xmath4 around @xmath0 with the prototype detector carrack i. the experimental parameters are taken as @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "the theoretical calculations indicate that the sensitivity with these parameter values exceeds the limit of ksvz axion , @xmath71 .",
    "the actual limit will be placed soon after making some more detailed calculations and checks .",
    "we have also made various developments for the detection apparatus ; @xmath72 significant improvement in the selective field ionization with pulsed electric field , @xmath72 keeping the good performance of apparatus in a long - term run at the very low temperature @xmath73 , @xmath72 sufficient cancellation of magnetic field in the detection cavity made of niobium , @xmath72 precise tuning of the resonant frequencies of the coupled cavities and the atomic transition frequency with stark shift , @xmath72 improvement of the atomic beam source providing better quality beam , and so on .",
