    "a major goal of neutron star ( ns ) research has remained unrealized despite 30 years of effort - to determine the fundamental properties of the superdense matter in a ns interior , in particular its equation of state ( eos ) and composition .",
    "there are many approaches which can be employed in this effort ( @xcite and references therein ) , but one of the most intensively studied is to exploit the thermal radiation from isolated ns .",
    "this radiation can be used to deduce information about the eos from neutron star cooling theory @xcite .",
    "extracting information about the ns interior is not straightforward , however , since the observed spectrum does not represent the ns surface emission , but is modified by radiative transfer effects in the ns atmosphere .",
    "the problem of unfolding the observed spectrum and understanding ns interiors thus depends on deducing the composition of the atmosphere .",
    "ns atmospheres are interesting in their own right . we know",
    "little about their nature , other than that some ns probably have hydrogen atmospheres @xcite , since they fit well to the sophisticated h - atmosphere models that have been developed @xcite .",
    "the observations have been silent on the question of whether non - hydrogen atmospheres exist .",
    "the ns 1e1207.4 - 5209was discovered by @xcite with the einstein observatory and is associated with the snr pks 1209 - 51 .",
    "subsequent observations established it as a prototypical radio silent ns associated with a snr @xcite .",
    "rosat and asca observations were fit with a black - body spectrum @xcite and a hydrogen atmosphere model @xcite .",
    "no x - ray pulsations were detected .",
    "_ chandra_detected x - ray pulsations with @xmath2 s @xcite . while this is perhaps not surprising in light of previous work ,",
    "the small period derivative estimated @xcite certainly was unexpected .",
    "the inferred surface b - field is @xmath3 g.    even more remarkable , @xcite ( hereafter szpt ) have discovered features at @xmath4 kev and @xmath5 kev are required to obtain acceptable fits to the spectrum ( which was fit with a @xmath6 k underlying black - body continuum ) .",
    "a feature of marginal significance and unclear origin was also noted at @xmath7 kev . a subsequent observation by _ xmm - newton_@xcite has provided some hint of substructure in the features , and has marginally detected the @xmath7 kev feature seen by _",
    "chandra_.    three different phenomenological fits indicative of either absorption lines or edges were used by szpt to fit the two strong features . of enormous significance",
    ", the spectrum was shown to be inconsistent with hydrogen atmosphere models . the intense effort which has gone into the hydrogen atmosphere models and their success in explaining other ns observations",
    "@xcite lends credence to the inevitable conclusion that the atmosphere of 1e1207.4 - 5209is something other than hydrogen .",
    "unfortunately , as pointed out elsewhere @xcite , work on non - hydrogen atmospheres at high b - fields is much less developed .",
    "szpt argued on various grounds that the features could not arise via cyclotron lines .",
    "instead they tentatively suggested emission from a once ionized - helium atmosphere with a b - field of @xmath8 g. this b - field is inconsistent with that derived from the spin parameters , but szpt argue this could be due to an off - centered b - field or glitches affecting the @xmath9 measurement .",
    "others have argued for a cyclotron line solution at lower b - field @xcite .",
    "@xcite claimed an atmosphere of iron or other high - z elements at a b - field of @xmath1 g , although they did not actually fit their _ xmm - newton_data to a model .",
    "in this paper we offer alternate interpretations of these spectral features .",
    "all our interpretations involve atomic transitions , mainly in he - like ions of mid - z elements at @xmath10 g , consistent with the b - field derived from the ns spin properties .",
    "the most likely of these interpretations is that the ns atmosphere contains oxygen or neon ; most noteworthy is that _ all _ our models , whether considering just the two strong features or including the third weak feature , demand mid - z elements for an acceptable solution .",
    "our model , combined with the _ xmm - newton_and _ chandra_data , easily rule out the iron and high - z solutions of @xcite .",
    "some comments are in order on our approach .",
    "the atomic spectroscopy data used in this analysis is based on a novel approach for obtaining fast and accurate solutions to the schrdinger equation for b - fields in the landau regime ( appropriate for all cases considered here ) .",
    "this approach , multiconfigurational , perturbative , hybrid , hartree , hartree - fock theory , allows rapid computation of transition energies and oscillator strengths for arbitrary atom , ion , excitation state and b - field ( @xcite , hereafter mh02a ) .",
    "this permits a complete search of all possible spectroscopic transitions consistent with the given line or edge energies .    while it may appear that this approach produces an uninterestingly large number of potential solutions , we demonstrate in a companion paper ( @xcite , hereafter mh02b ) that this is not the case .",
    "we show that the presence of two or more line or edge features provides a remarkable robustness to a host of poorly - understood atomic physics effects and unambiguously restricts the atmosphere composition to mid - z elements .",
    "we only briefly mention our data reduction here , as our approach closely follows that of szpt .",
    "indeed , we emphasize that none of our conclusions here would be modified if we simply used the spectral line parameters derived by szpt .",
    "our analysis is described in more detail in mh02b .",
    "the results presented here are for phase - integrated spectra only . subsequent work will consider phase - resolved data , which can provide more information on the system geometry .",
    "we fit the spectrum with two models : a blackbody with two absorption edges ( edge model ) and a blackbody with two absorption lines ( line model ) .",
    "as noted by szpt , these spectral features are required to get acceptable fits .",
    "the fit parameters for our models are given in table [ tab_fit ] .",
    "we show the raw _ chandra_spectrum in figure [ fig_bb ] overlaid with a blackbody to clearly indicate the presence of the absorption features .",
    "figures [ fig_lineedge ] show the results of our best fit line and edge models .",
    "we briefly review the quantum numbers of bound electrons in b - fields in the landau regime .",
    "states are labeled by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the magnetic quantum number and @xmath13 is the longitudinal quantum number .",
    "the @xmath14 states have larger binding energy than the @xmath15 states .",
    "consistent with the terminology of mh02a , we call the former tightly - bound states and the latter loosely - bound states . generally the ground state of an ion is a tightly - bound state . in the x - ray band transitions are mostly likely to be either photo - absorption ( tightly - bound state to continuum ) or absorption lines from tightly - bound to loosely - bound state ( tight - loose transition ) .",
    "tight - tight transitions appear in the optical band .",
    "details of the transition selection rules are discussed elsewhere ( mh02a , mh02b ) .",
    "we first considered the two strongest features at @xmath4 kev and @xmath5 kev and assume both features are due to atomic transitions in a single element and ionization state ( case a ) .",
    "this effectively defines a solution for the dominant absorbing element in terms of he - like ions .",
    "li - like ions and those in lower ionization states are not dominant absorbers under the expected atmospheric conditions ( mh02b ) .",
    "h - like ions can not be the dominant absorbers because this is grossly incommensurate with the features relative widths and strengths even under conditions far removed from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( mh02b ) .",
    "h - like ions can , however , be present since the relevant spectral features will be blended with the he - like features . in the he - like ions ,",
    "the electrons are making tight - loose transitions out of the @xmath16 ground state to the @xmath17 excited states respectively , or to the continuum .",
    "neither tightly - bound states at higher magnetic quantum number nor non - adjacent tightly - bound states are acceptable . in the former case the feature energy ratios can not be produced and in the latter case unobserved features in the _ chandra_band would be produced .",
    "we searched for any combination of element , redshift and b - field which could give the observed positions of the spectral features .",
    "our b - field range was @xmath18 g to @xmath19 g. in the case of edge solutions we also permitted ( small ) pressure shifts ( details in mh02b ) .",
    "line solutions are insensitive to pressure shifts .",
    "the properties of the solutions including derived values of the b - field and redshift are shown in table [ tab_summary ] .",
    "the first two solutions involve atomic line transitions in he - like oxygen and neon and the third solution he - like neon absorption edges .",
    "a similar oxygen solution was rejected because its redshift was too low , violating causality and stability conditions for the ns interior @xcite .",
    "for the neon edge solution there is an electron cyclotron line in the _ chandra_/_xmm - newton_energy band but it was made to overlap the higher energy spectral feature by introducing a small pressure shift ( @xmath20 ev ) .",
    "such pressure shifts slightly affect the energy ratio of the two edge features and serve to further constrain other elements and conditions of the atmosphere ( mh02b ) . the line and edge widths are all consistent with expectations for stark broadening and non - constant b - field broadening respectively ( mh02b ) .",
    "our case b assumes that one spectral feature is an atomic transition and the second is a cyclotron line .",
    "a 1.4 kev or 0.7 kev electron cyclotron line defines a b - field of @xmath21 g or @xmath22 g respectively . in the former case solutions can only be found for h - like ions transitioning out of the @xmath23 ground state to the @xmath24 excited state or the continuum .",
    "these are all mid - z solutions albeit with lower b - field than those considered above . in the case of a 0.7 kev electron cyclotron line ,",
    "the b - field is low enough that our perturbation method breaks down for higher landau levels and is therefore less accurate ; we estimate that putative solutions would involve the elements beryllium or boron and are therefore implausible .",
    "if one of the features is a nuclear cyclotron line then the other feature must be a transition from the ground state of either helium or hydrogen .",
    "however there is no combination of @xmath25 and @xmath26 that can reproduce the line positions .",
    "thus nuclear cyclotron lines are ruled out .",
    "although case b is formally allowed we consider it highly unlikely .",
    "there are difficulties in attempting to reconcile the depth and width of the spectral features ( mh02b ) .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting that even this scenario including cyclotron lines only admits solutions involving mid - z elements .",
    "table [ tab_summary ] also shows proposed solutions if the feature at @xmath7 kev is confirmed ( case c solutions ) .",
    "again it is of importance to note that only mid - z solutions are acceptable .",
    "we had to relax one of our previous assumptions by assuming additional significant absorption from h - like ions .",
    "an admixture of h - like ions in a given atmosphere is quite plausible for reasonable conditions of temperature and density ( mh02b ) .",
    "the first case considered is identical to the he - like oxygen / neon case presented above but with the addition of a h - like oxygen / neon absorption edge due to the @xmath23 ground state to continuum transition . in this model",
    "the other h - like lines overlap the he - like lines so no additional features are produced .",
    "the second solution invokes photoabsorption edges in he - like neon for the two lower energy features and the higher energy feature is due to an electron cyclotron line .",
    "our most important conclusion is that _ all _ viable solutions for b - fields comparable to that inferred from the ns spin parameters require mid - z atmospheres in both the two and three spectral feature case .",
    "our solutions which most closely correspond to the inferred b - field demand he - like oxygen and neon .",
    "in contrast to this paper , szpt proposed ultrahigh b - field solutions .",
    "their helium atmosphere appears problematic , however . in order to get the right feature positions szpt s",
    "h - like helium features must of necessity arise in transitions from electrons in the @xmath23 or @xmath27 quantum states to @xmath24 and @xmath28 states .",
    "the @xmath24 state is heavily depopulated at the types of ion densities one expects and the @xmath28 state is actually autoionized due to the large nuclear cyclotron energy . in fact the motional stark shift and pressure effects in helium will likely destroy all the loosely - bound states .",
    "consequently one is forced to assume the features are absorption edges , and this leads to severe difficulty explaining the relative edge strengths ( mh02b ) .",
    "@xcite did not fit their _ xmm - newton_data , but proposed nevertheless that the spectral features could be attributed to iron or some other high - z element at a field @xmath1 g. our current work rules out their proposal .",
    "there is no combination of b - field , redshift , element or ionization states , even with unphysical , arbitrary pressure shifts , that is consistent with the _ xmm - newton_and _ chandra_data .",
    "the interpretation we present here makes an important prediction : the observed features may show substantial substructure when observed with higher spectral resolution .",
    "transition energies from the tightly bound ground state to loosely bound final excited states differing in longitudinal quantum number are rather close to each other , and may be blended .",
    "details of predicted energies and transition assignments are presented in mh02b .",
    "whether detailed atmospheric models would lead to a washing out of this substructure through broadening is not clear , but its detection would certainly confirm that the features are atomic transitions since we would not expect similar substructure in cyclotron lines .",
    "in fact , @xcite claim a marginal detection of such substructure .    concerning the b - field derived from the free parameter fits to the data , we note that our neon and oxygen line solutions are all within a factor of two or three of the b - field derived from spin parameters .",
    "the discrepancy may lie in the ns b - field geometry or line blending .",
    "line blending will affect our b - field ( and redshift ) estimate , but will not affect our element identifications .",
    "the analysis here , along with that of szpt , begs the question of why there is anything in the atmosphere other than hydrogen .",
    "oxygen or neon are expected constituents near the ns mass cut in many models of supernova explosions @xcite . indeed due to turbulent mixing in such explosions oxygen",
    "can be found throughout the core @xcite . but given that a very thin layer of hydrogen accreted from the interstellar medium is enough to produce an optically thick hydrogen atmosphere , we are left to ponder mechanisms by which such accretion can be inhibited , or at least permit simultaneous emission from a mid - z element .",
    "one possibility is that the timescale for an optically thick layer to accrete onto the surface is shorter than that for gravitational stratification in the atmosphere @xcite . in that case , even trace amounts of mid - z elements could lead to strong emission @xcite .",
    "optical observations of the associated snr indicate the presence of oxygen and it has been argued that the unusually high galactic latitude of this ns implies the oxygen originated in the progenitor star @xcite",
    ". thus a rich source of oxygen is available .",
    "alternately the mid - z atmosphere may be associated with the ns mass cut , and a propeller effect may be severely inhibiting accretion of hydrogen .",
    "we note that several of our proposed solutions allow a hydrogen - rich environment ( mh02b ) .    for more progress to be made on 1e1207.4 - 5209it",
    "will be necessary to develop complete models of ns atmosphere for mid - z elements incorporating the more sophisticated atomic data bases we have utilized here .",
