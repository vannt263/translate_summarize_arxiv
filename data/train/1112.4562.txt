    "for the sake of illustration , the calculation has been performed using the simplifying assumption of equal phase shifts , i.e. when the values of @xmath151 , @xmath156 , and @xmath156 are all equal . the phase ( current ) pattern is also shown in the inset of figure fig .  [ omega_3band ] .",
    "this is the pattern denoted as the type @xmath157 in the orginal work of varma  ref .",
    "the saddle point in the grand potential @xmath23 is obtained for zero phase on bonds , and turnning on phase around zero will lead to an increase of @xmath23 .",
    "the situation when all three @xmath4 are different is similar .",
    "note that additional variational parameters such as @xmath3 are required to complete our study on three band hubbard model , however this is out of the scope of present paper .",
    "the central aim of this paper was to extended the vca method to study the time - reversal symmetry broken phase .",
    "we proposed to use two variational parameters , the hopping @xmath3 and phase factor @xmath4 , to study the staggered flux phase in the 2d hubbard model .",
    "our calculation suggest a metastable staggered flux phase in the intermediate and small @xmath0 regions . for the case of half filling",
    ", the flux phase appears to be the most stable at @xmath62 .",
    "this implies that the staggered flux phase , or at least its fluctuations , are more likely to be observed in the small @xmath0 than in large @xmath0 region .",
    "we also studied the stability of the staggered flux phase by comparing its grand potential with those of the superconductor and antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "we found that one of these latter phases is always more stable than the staggered flux phase both at as well as away from half filling .    from our results on the one - band 2d hubabrd model we can not draw a clear picture of which interactions are crucial to cause the orbital currents , although we clearly observe that a nearest - neighbour repulsion ( @xmath158 ) decreases the current , that would be present in the absence of the intersite interaction .",
    "in contrast , an attractive nearest - neighbour interaction ( @xmath159 ) leads to an increase in the current comparing with the @xmath160 case .",
    "the staggered - flux order that emerges in the presence of @xmath159 was previously reported within the strong - coupling regime @xcite .",
    "our numerical results demonstrate that such result is also applicable to the intermediate values of @xmath0 . at last",
    ", we also extented the method for time - reversal symmetry breaking phase to study the three band hubbard model . by using only the shifts of phases on each hopping terms as variational parameter",
    ", we did not find a stable vca saddle point for the staggered flux phase .",
