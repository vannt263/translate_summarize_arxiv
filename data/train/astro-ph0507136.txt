    "these transiting planets are crucial for understanding giant planets in general since their masses and radii can easily be determined , and careful multi - wavelength observations can reveal some information about the planet s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "recently , two transiting planets , hd209458b and tres-1 , were observed with the spitzer space telescope , providing the first direct measurements of their thermal flux . by comparing ir fluxes in and out of secondary eclipse ( when the planet is behind the star ) , @xcite measured the planet - star flux density ratio at 4.5 and 8  for tres-1 . independently , @xcite measured the flux density ratio at 24  for hd209458b .",
    "these measurements provide the best constraints , so far , on the thermal structure and chemical composition of highly irradiated egps .",

    ", they are substantially heated by radiation from their parent stars . following the discovery of the planet around 51 pegasi @xcite , a variety of atmosphere models suitable for estimating the properties of these so - called  hot jupiters \"",
    "were published @xcite . however , since these planets probably have strong day - to - night photospheric differences , their potential lack of symmetry adds complications to an already difficult model atmosphere problem .",
    "several of the most challenging issues are the coverage and types of clouds ( if present ) , redistribution of the absorbed stellar flux by atmospheric currents , depth dependent non - solar abundances , and photospheric temperature and pressure gradients from the day to night sides .",
    "these problems have been dealt with ( or avoided ) in a variety of ways and , therefore , a variety of model predictions exist .",
    "new models , that estimate the horizontal atmospheric gradients under the assumption of radiative - convective equilibrium , are presented below .",
    "several of the standard assumptions for global energy redistribution are explored .",
    "model results are also compared to the most recent spitzer measurements and estimates are given for the planet - star flux density ratios in the spitzer 24  mips band and the four irac bands as a function of orbital phase .",
    "the irradiated models presented below were calculated using the phoenix atmosphere code @xcite adapted to include extrinsic radiation as described in barman et al .",

    "the spherically symmetric radiative transfer and chemical equilibrium equations were solved self - consistently , while explicitly accounting for the wavelength - dependent extrinsic radiation .",
    "the extrinsic radiation was also modeled with phoenix and , in each case , closely matches the observed parent star spectrum .",
    "the major differences between the computation of the bha01 models and those presented here lie with the treatment of dust in the atmosphere and the assumptions concerning the redistribution of absorbed stellar flux over the planet s day and night hemispheres .",

    "since radiative photospheres have short sedimentation time - scales , cloud growth should be difficult to sustain making the cloud - free assumption reasonable .",
    "however , this assumption may break down if strong zonal winds are present and advective time - scales are comparable to sedimentation time - scales .",
    "the efficiency of gravitational settling will also depend on the poorly constrained eddy diffusion coefficient @xcite .    in bha01 ,",
    "cloud - free atmospheres were modeled using the `` cond '' opacity setup @xcite . the cond setup accounts for dust formation in the atmosphere , as determined by chemical equilibrium equations , but excludes the dust opacity when computing the thermal and spectroscopic properties of the atmosphere . excluding",
    "the dust opacity was intended to approximate the effects of cloud formation followed by efficient gravitational settling ( often referred to as `` rainout '' ) which acts to deplete an atmosphere of many important refractory elements .",
    "rainout and the depletion of refractory elements have been recognized for some time as important processes in the atmospheres of jovian planets and brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the success of these models is strong motivation for exploring the rainout assumption in extrasolar planet atmospheres .",
    "while the cond approximation does effectively remove refractory elements , it does not alter the overall abundance of an element sequestered by grain formation at a given temperature and pressure .",
    "grain formation and efficient gravitational settling alter the abundance of an element by continually removing the refractory elements that make up a grain until the grain is no longer able to form due to a lack of one or more constituents . in the absence of replenishment ( e.g. , by convective updrafts ) ,",
    "certain layers of an atmosphere where only gravitational settling has occurred will not only be free of dust species but also free of a significant number of metals and related molecules . for a description of this effect in jupiter s atmosphere ,",
    "see @xcite .    the cond case , therefore",
    ", does not go far enough in removing refractory elements from the upper atmosphere and can lead to a small concentration of key absorbers like tio and vo that are important in irradiated atmospheres .",
    "these two molecules have strong absorption bands near the peak flux densities of solar type stars .",
    "consequently , their presence or absence can greatly affect the depth at which the stellar flux is absorbed in the planet s atmosphere and , thus , alter the predicted atmospheric structure @xcite .    in this work",
    ", an improved cloud - free model was used that iteratively reduces ( at a given layer ) the elemental abundances involved in grain formation and recomputes the chemical equilibrium with each new set of stratified elemental abundances .",
    "this model is similar to the rainout model of @xcite , except that the depletion of elements is continued until grains ( and thus grain opacities ) are no longer present ( see also @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the resulting equilibrium chemistry and opacity sampling of this cloud - free model are fully self - consistent , unlike the earlier cond models which simply excluded the grain opacity .",
    "also , for the models described below , ti and v were significantly depleted from the photosphere by the rainout process leading to negligible concentrations of tio and vo . for a detailed discussion of the differences between rainout and cond irradiated models , see barman et al .",

    "the majority of static atmosphere models arrive at a single temperature - pressure ( t - p ) profile intended to represent an average of either the day side or over the entire planet @xcite .",
    "however , if most short period planets are well represented by a static atmosphere in radiative - convective equilibrium , then one should expect them to have a horizontal ( day - to - night ) temperature gradient  simply due to the center - to - limb variation in the amount of incident stellar flux received by the planet . in the absence of a 3-d model atmosphere code ,",
    "one approach that comes closer to the real solution is to divide a planet s day side into a series of concentric regions around the sub - stellar point . in the static case",
    ", suitably large regions should interact very little via radiative transfer processes , except perhaps near the terminator .",
    "the planetary atmospheres described below were modeled by dividing the day side into 10 concentric regions defined by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the angle between the surface normal and the direction to the star ( see fig .",
    "[ toon1 ] ) . for these regions , @xmath16 ranged from 1.0 ( at the sub - stellar point ) to 0.1 ( the model region closest to the terminator ) , in steps of @xmath17 . the corresponding t - p profiles and emergent intensities were modeled using 1-d , spherically symmetric , atmospheres each receiving incident stellar flux along the appropriate angle for a given region . for these day side models ,",
    "the radiative transfer equation was modified so that the incident specific intensities along any @xmath16 and azimuthal angle @xmath18 were given by , @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the dirac delta function .",
    "in which case , it follows that the incident fluxes are simply , @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the monochromatic fluxes from the star s surface , @xmath23 is the stellar radius , and @xmath24 is the distance from the stellar surface to the planet s atmosphere . for the night side , a single , non",
    "- irradiated , model was used .",
    "all models were solved self - consistently so that each @xmath16-region had a chemistry characterized by its t - p profile . by having chemical equilibria",
    "consistent with the t - p profiles across the planet s atmosphere , this approach naturally leads to variations in the important photospheric opacity sources from the day to night side  an important aspect when computing the synthetic spectra .    since egps",
    "are believed to have fully convective interiors , the _ intrinsic _ effective temperature ( @xmath25 ) characterizes the intrinsic luminosity of an irradiated model atmosphere , defined by @xmath26 . for non - irradiated models ,",

    "the adiabat was selected based on planetary interior and evolution calculations for a given mass , age , metallicity , and irradiation @xcite .",
    "this entropy matching technique has also been used for irradiated binary stars and allows one to assign models with different intrinsic luminosities to different regions of the same star or planet @xcite .",
    "the monochromatic fluxes from the model planet were obtained by integrating the emergent intensities along an observer s line - of - sight ( @xmath28 ) for a given observer - planet - star orientation . @xmath29",
    "the integration was performed by distributing @xmath30 points over the entire surface with corresponding cubature integration weights ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the distribution of points was determined by the minimization of potential energy on the unit sphere .",
    "this distribution is nearly orientation independent , unlike the standard latitude - longitude grid , and results in very small integration errors @xcite .",
    "each point on the observer - facing hemisphere was assigned an emergent intensity spectrum corresponding to the angle , @xmath32 , between the observer s @xmath28 and the surface normal ( see fig . [ toon1 ] ) , and depending on the day or night region in which the point belonged . numerical integration of eq .",

    ", the phase - dependent spectra can be estimated while taking into account the center - to - limb variation of the planet s emergent intensities  which might include a combination of limb brightening and darkening .",
    "the emergent intensities were sampled over 114 directions per @xmath16-region and were assumed to be azimuthally symmetric about the surface normal .",
    "assuming azimuthal symmetry is justified since the present work is concerned primarily with the thermal flux , not scattered light .",
    "phase - dependent optical spectra will be explored in a later paper .",
    "the simple approach outlined above has several limitations . since radiation passing through one region into another",
    "is neglected , heating of the upper atmosphere near the terminator may be underestimated at low gas pressures .",
    "however , this is unlikely to affect the emergent thermal ir spectrum that forms deeper in the atmosphere .",
    "it has also been assumed that the planet is tidally locked and , hence , presents a constant face to the parent star .",
    "the models are also time - independent and static and , consequently , neglect the effects of zonal winds that could change the thermal profiles by coupling the hot day side to the cooler night side .",
    "the approach outlined in the previous section is designed to model the planet s atmosphere under the assumption that the gas is truly static and in radiative - convective equilibrium .",
    "as such , this approach will predict the maximum heating at the sub - stellar point and very little heating at the terminator .",
    "however , as mentioned above , an important consequence of stellar heating is horizontal atmospheric flows capable of transporting appreciable amounts of energy to the night side .",
    "the impacts of horizontal motion on egp atmospheres have been modeled by a variety of groups , each predicting some level of atmospheric circulation that depends strongly on adopted opacities and general approaches to the problem @xcite . despite the differences in methods and results ,",
    "the general consensus from these hydrodynamic simulations is that circulations can redistribute a fraction of the incident energy over large portions of a strongly irradiated planetary atmosphere .    for single , 1-d , model atmospheres designed to reproduce the detailed chemistry , opacities , and emergent spectrum ( but not the atmospheric motions )",
    ", the effects of energy redistribution have been folded into a single parameter , referred to as @xmath35 in this work .",
    "the @xmath35 parameter is simply the ratio of the planet s cross - sectional area ( @xmath36 ) and the surface area of the planet from which the absorbed stellar luminosity is to be re - emitted . in this case , the stellar flux incident at the top of the model atmosphere becomes , @xmath37 for a more detailed description of the energy balance in an irradiated binary companion and the development of a similar @xmath35 parameter , see @xcite .",
    "when the incident flux is scaled by @xmath35 , the underlying assumption is that dynamical processes in the atmosphere are efficient enough to uniformly distribute the incident luminosity over either the day hemisphere ( @xmath38 ) or the entire sphere ( @xmath39 ) . in addition , every point on the day side ( or entire surface ) is assumed to be identical and , thus , can be described by a single 1-d model with the same emergent and incident flux .",
    "note that the @xmath40 case corresponds to the average ( over @xmath16 ) of the incident flux defined in eq .",
    "[ finc ] . also , the no - redistribution and @xmath38 cases receive and re - radiate the same amount of incident luminosity from the day side , but will predict very different t - p profiles and phase - dependent spectra ( see below ) .",
    "the greatest number of observational constraints exists for the planets tres-1 and hd209458b .",
    "models specifically tailored for these two objects are presented below , adopting the parameters listed in table [ tab1 ] , and are compared to the recent spitzer data .",
    "figure [ tr1 ] shows the sequence of solar metallicity t - p profiles across the day and night sides of tres-1 . on the day side ,",
    "@xmath41k which is motivated by evolution calculations that reproduce the observed radius of tres-1 @xcite .",
    "the night side atmosphere model with the same adiabat as the day side , has @xmath42k based on the entropy matching criteria mentioned above .",
    "the sphere in fig . [ tr1 ] shows the concentric regions around the sub - stellar point represented by each atmosphere model .",
    "as expected , a steep temperature gradient along an isobar , @xmath43 , is present from the sub - stellar point to the terminator . at @xmath44 bar",
    ", @xmath45 is very large across most of the day side and increases dramatically as the temperatures drop off near the terminator ( designated by the night side t - p profile ) . unlike the deeper layers ,",
    "the top most layers of the atmosphere receive a steady supply of incident stellar flux , even when @xmath46  however at shallow angles with respect to the surface normal .",
    "consequently , @xmath45 is smaller for @xmath47 bar compared to higher pressure depths for most of the day side except near the terminator .",
    "note also that the t - p profiles ( for large @xmath35 ) become flatter at low p and steeper at high p and , eventually , become inverted very near the terminator .",
    "the stellar heating also causes the atmospheric extension bar and at @xmath48 bar . ] to increase from the terminator to the sub - stellar point by a factor of @xmath49 .",
    "the change in extension coincides with a significant pressure gradient below the photosphere along constant - height surfaces where the change in pressure from the day to night side can be factors as large as 50 to 100 . above the photosphere ,",
    "the day - to - night pressure gradient is present , but fairly small . despite the large increase in extension ,",
    "the change in radius is modest leading to no more than a 5% increase in the area of an isobaric surface on the day side compared to the night .",
    "also of interest is the radiative - convective boundary which is not on an isobar and is significantly deeper at the sub - stellar point ( @xmath50 bar ) compared to the terminator and night side ( @xmath51 bar ) .",
    "the condensation curves for fe , mg@xmath52sio@xmath53 , mgsio@xmath54  and na@xmath52s are also shown in fig .",
    "cloud formation is typically believed to occur near the intersection of the t - p profile and the condensation curve for a given species .",
    "while the models presented here are cloud - free , the condensation curves suggest that photospheric clouds might be possible at a variety of atmospheric depths and compositions but , in the no - redistribution case , would be confined to @xmath55 50% of the day side around the sub - stellar point .",
    "the no - redistribution model also suggests that clouds might form at much greater heights ( i.e. lower p ) around the sub - stellar point compared to the @xmath38 redistribution model .",
    "the presence of clouds would have an impact on the predicted t - p profile and , therefore , needs to be treated self - consistently .",
    "cloud formation across the day and night sides will be explored in a future paper .    the high day side temperatures lead to an atmospheric chemistry dominated by h@xmath52",
    ", he , h@xmath52o and co. however , near the terminator and on the night side , most of the carbon is bound in ch@xmath53 . in fig .",
    "[ tr2 ] , the planet - star flux density ratios , determined from the transit light curves , has error bars much smaller than the individual planet or stellar radii .",
    "therefore , the flux density ratio comparison is not limited by the typical uncertainties of an absolute flux determination . ] , @xmath56 for the no - redistribution model are compared to the sptizer observations along with standard 1-d models with @xmath40 and @xmath39 . since the stellar spectrum at ir wavelengths is fairly smooth , all of the features seen are due to absorption in the planet s day side photosphere .",
    "strong absorption by h@xmath52o and co are easily identified in the model .",
    "the two hottest models ( no redistribution and @xmath40 ) are in good agreement with the observations at 8  but significantly overestimate the flux density at 4.5 .",
    "the models with complete redistribution ( @xmath39 ) agrees reasonably well at 4.5  and , at the 2@xmath57 level , agrees with the 8 observations . despite the broad wavelength span of the irac instrument , all of the irac bands probe a fairly narrow region of the planetary atmosphere between @xmath58 and @xmath59 bar .    also shown in fig .",
    "[ tr2 ] are the flux density ratios using a spectrum from a non - irradiated brown dwarf model atmosphere with @xmath60k which roughly corresponds to the equilibrium @xmath27 of the @xmath39 model .",
    "while models of brown dwarfs appear to agree very well with recent spitzer irs spectra of l and t dwarfs @xcite , the observations of tres-1 are clearly inconsistent with a standard brown dwarf spectrum , especially around 8 .",
    "this disagreement confirms that irradiated egps have atmospheric structures very different from isolated brown dwarfs ; a property that was not immediately obvious in the past .",
    "as demonstrated by our own solar system planets , it is possible that egps do not have the same metal abundances ( or relative proportions ) as their parent star .",
    "the main discrepancy between the no - redistribution and @xmath40 , solar abundance , models is the 4.5  flux which coincides with the strong fundamental co absorption band .",
    "the flux density ratio could be low at these wavelengths due to enhanced metal abundances . in order to achieve a co absorption feature with flux density ratios as low as in the @xmath39 solar abundance model ( which reproduces the 4.5  irac observations )",
    ", the metal abundance would have to be 10 times that of the parent star ( see fig .",
    "[ tr2 ] ) . however , given the width of the irac band passes ,",
    "the fluxes outside the co absorption band remain high enough to keep the model s integrated flux density ratio above the 2@xmath57 error bar .",
    "note that increasing the c to o ratio does not improve the comparison to observations .",
    "a larger c to o ratio increases co absorption , but simultaneously lowers the water concentration thereby increasing the planet s fluxes at wavelengths red - ward of the 4.5  that are also included in the irac band .",
    "figure [ hd1 ] shows the t - p profiles for hd209458b assuming solar abundances , and the parameters listed in table [ tab1 ] .",

    "the predicted t - p trend across the day side is similar to that for tres-1 .",
    "the major differences are due to the greater parent star luminosity for hd209458b , which leads to a significantly hotter sub - stellar point .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity is also higher for hd209458b , which leads to warmer regions near the terminator .",
    "the decline in temperature above the nearly isothermal photosphere ( p @xmath63 bar ) for the hottest portions of the dayside is consistent with recent works by other groups @xcite .",
    "this temperature decline points to some of the differences mentioned above between the present rainout models and those based on the earlier cond approximation . for hd209458b , with @xmath40 , the cond assumption leads to a nearly isothermal profile ( t @xmath64k ) for most of the atmosphere ( see fig . 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "while the complete removal of tio and vo via the adopted rainout process contributes to the cooler outer atmosphere and hotter photosphere shown in fig .",

    "if clouds are sustainable on the planet s day side , then fe , mgsio@xmath54  and mg@xmath52sio@xmath53  clouds might form at very low pressures across most of the day side surrounding the sub - stellar point . near the terminator ,",

    "another potentially useful limit for hd209458b has been set at shorter wavelengths by ground based observations @xcite .",
    "these observations indicate the planet s spectrum may have a less prominent 2.2  peak ( or an overall lower luminosity ) than predicted by many models .",
    "this limit also favors @xmath69 .",
    "since the entire day hemisphere has been modeled by a collection of t - p profiles and intensity spectra , estimates for the phase - dependent fluxes can be constructed simply by changing the star - planet - observer orientation and re - integrating the surface intensities ( see eqs .",

    "small values for @xmath74 suggest that winds will not be capable of entirely removing the large day - night temperature differences even at photospheric depths .",
    "detailed radiative - convective equilibrium models have been presented above for the atmospheres of hd209458b and tres-1 . in the absence of energy redistribution ,",
    "the models predict steep horizontal temperature gradients from the sub - stellar point to the night side that vary substantially with depth .",
    "compared to earlier works , which assumed very efficient energy redistribution , the no - redistribution models predict much hotter temperatures across most of the day hemisphere and significantly cooler temperatures near the terminator .",
    "the existence of steep horizontal temperature gradients in equilibrium models strengthens the case for strong zonal winds",
    ". however , fast winds ( @xmath55 2 km sec@xmath71 ) capable of altering the global atmospheric temperature profile are unlikely to entirely remove these temperature gradients , especially at pressures lower than a bar @xcite .",
    "since @xmath74 decreases rapidly with decreasing pressure ( i.e. towards the top of the atmosphere ) , the horizontal and vertical temperature gradients may well have a mixture of the t - p characteristics shown above for the various redistribution scenarios .",

    "deeper into the atmosphere ( where @xmath76 ) advection is probably an important mechanism for energy transport which could lead to a t - p structure similar to that of an @xmath40 or @xmath39 redistribution model for @xmath77 bar .",
    "consequently , the t - p profile could , in some cases , be fairly flat across much of the day side photosphere .",
    "note that a flat photospheric t - p profile would produce a spectrum close to that of a blackbody  a possibility which , so far , is not excluded by spitzer observations ( see @xcite for a blackbody comparison to the tres-1 spitzer data ) .    the 24  spitzer observations of hd209458b have been shown to favor an atmosphere undergoing efficient day - to - night energy redistribution .",
    "the 4.5 and 8.0  observations of tres-1 also favor an atmosphere which is experiencing significant redistribution .",
    "however , an @xmath39 redistribution model only agrees with both data points , simultaneously , at the 2@xmath57 level . for both planets",
    ", it appears that the fully static , no - redistribution , case is ruled out by the spitzer data .",
    "however , the data points are too few and have error bars that are too large to significantly constrain the model parameters .    in anticipation of additional spitzer observations , phase - dependent spectra have been calculated , along with phase - dependent planet - star flux density ratios . for hd209458b , placing limits on the fluxes at the quadrature and near night side phases ( esp . at 24 ) would test the large night side luminosity ( with @xmath78k ) predicted by evolution calculations .",
    "the ratios of the planet s flux densities at phases 0.5 and 0.25 could also further constrain the degree to which energy is redistributed to the night side .",
    "the current work is also applicable to planets in non - transiting orbits .",
    "there is a direct correspondence between the phase - dependent fluxes shown above ( for an edge - on orbit ) and the _ inclination_-dependent fluxes for a planet at superior conjunction in an arbitrarily inclined orbit .",
    "therefore , the predictions made above suggest that spitzer could detect flux variations due to a close - in planet with orbital inclination as small as 45@xmath79 ( i.e. , phase 0.375 or 0.625 in fig .

    "<S> the day - night temperature difference is explored and phase - dependent flux densities are predicted for both planets . for hd209458b and tres-1 , models with significant day - to - night energy redistribution are required to reproduce the observations . </S>",
    "<S> however , the observational error bars are large and a range of models remains viable . </S>"
