    "galaxy mergers play a pivotal role in the assembly of galaxies in the universe across cosmic time and these mergers are most prevalent in high density regions at the centers of galaxy clusters .",
    "the merger dynamics is influenced by various factors such as the size , mass , impact parameter , relative velocity , gas content and the relative inclination of the merging galaxies within the cluster .",
    "merger phenomena occur on different physical scales , which strongly affects the properties of galaxies .",
    "mergers on galactic scale ( @xmath3 kpc ) may result in ram pressure stripping of gas , formation of long tidal tails and enhanced star formation , as well as transformation of the morphology of galaxies .",
    "this makes cluster centers fascinating laboratories to study galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the merger of the galaxies is also thought to be a major factor in the growth of black holes , and triggering of agn activity with occasional powerful relativistic jet ejection , which may transport matter and energy from the interiors to the surrounding ambient medium through various feedback processes .",
    "on smallest scales ( @xmath4pc ) the final inspiral stage of black hole merger also results in powerful gravitational wave emission . on very large scales ( @xmath5 kpc ) the shocks and turbulence induced into the intra cluster medium ( icm ) during galaxy or group mergers are believed to inject large amounts of turbulent energy and subsequent shock heating of the icm to x - ray temperatures with disruption of cooling - cores @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab5 ]    using the luminosity based method , the black hole masses of the galaxies were calculated from their k band absolute magnitudes .",
    "we used 6x times deeper data for a407 available in 2mass survey .",
    "we have used the equation connecting k band absolute magnitude of bulge component to the central black hole mass given by @xcite @xmath6    the black hole masses thus obtained for all the nine galaxies are listed in table  4 .",
    "the following caveats are worth mentioning here : it is unclear whether the canonical @xmath7-@xmath8 relation will suffice to galaxies in such hostile environment , undergoing violent mergers and stripping of stars in multiple tidal encounters , as clearly evidenced by the formation of a large scale stellar halo of stripped matter in ` zwicky s nonet ' ( figure  [ fig1 ] and figure  [ 2mass_color ] ) .",
    "the same concern applies if one were to obtain @xmath7 using the k - band luminosity of bulge and the @xmath7-@xmath9 correlation shown above .",
    "moreover , the effect of the gravitational potential of the background stellar halo ( which is highly dark matter dominated ; @xcite ) and close merging galaxies on the bulge stellar velocity dispersion of a galaxy also are possible factors which need to be accounted for during black hole mass calculations . in this paper we have not attempted to do so .",
    "but , for checking this issue , in table  5 last column we show the ratio of black hole mass estimated from @xmath7-@xmath8 correlation ( @xmath10 ) to that obtained from @xmath7-@xmath9 method ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath12 is @xmath13 for galaxies with well determined black hole masses , which suggests that possibly @xmath7-@xmath9 method gives smaller black hole masses due to tidal stripping of the outer envelope of some galaxies and thus a reduction in their k band luminosity or , @xmath7-@xmath8 black hole masses are overestimated .",
    "the stripped away matter from the presently observed nuclei must provide a large fraction of the total luminosity to the observed stellar halo .",
    "the main parameters of the stellar halo which is detectable upto the r band surface brightness limit of @xmath14 mag arcsec@xmath15 ( and possibly beyond ) , quoted by @xcite are ; central mass density @xmath16 pc@xmath17 , mass - to - light ratio in r band @xmath18 , and halo radial velocity dispersion @xmath19 km s@xmath20 . from this value of @xmath21 and",
    "taking halo radius @xmath22 ( @xmath23 kpc ) , we obtain the total dynamical mass as @xmath24 m@xmath25 , interestingly which is of the same order as that of a super giant cd galaxy .",
    "we have presented the analysis of radio , optical and infra - red imaging observations of the extraordinary radio source 4c  35.06 found in abell 407 galaxy cluster , and have also presented spectroscopic observations of the central group of galaxies in which it resides .",
    "our main results are as follows :    1 .",
    "the central region of abell 407 hosts a remarkably tight ensemble of nine passive , early type red ellipticals galaxies within @xmath26 ( 53 kpc ) region , embedded within a faint , diffuse stellar halo . this unique galactic system , named as the ` zwicky s",
    "nonet ' , provides a unique and compelling evidence for a rare site of ongoing formation of a giant cd galaxy at the cluster center .",
    "the deepest yet radio observations of 4c  35.06 at 150 , 235 and 610 mhz with gmrt clearly reveals the complete radio structure for the first time . a complex central core region along with a helically twisted and kinked bipolar radio jet structure extend to @xmath27  kpc , which terminates into diffuse , ultra steep spectrum regions at the jet extremities is found .",
    "the linear size of the large scale jet system grows from 230 kpc at 610 mhz to 400 kpc at 150mhz , therefore implying steep spectrum emission at outer regions , that is better detected at lower frequencies .",
    "gmrt flux density measurement gives a total flux density of 1.7 jy at 610 mhz , 4.7 jy at 235 mhz and 6.0 jy at 150 mhz respectively , with overall steep spectral index @xmath28 .",
    "the central core region shows flat spectrum , due to superposition of possibly a few compact radio loud agns , that becomes gradually steeper along the jet away from the center , upto the outer most extremities of the jet .",
    "this indicates that there is no fresh injection of accelerated particles in relic regions , and hence the extreme steepness of the spectra therein .",
    "gmrt has provided the clear images of the radio jet at 610 mhz and of diffused steep spectrum relic / fossil regions ( d1 and d2 ) in the 235 mhz and 150 mhz for 4c  35.06 .",
    "these regions are also hinted in 74 mhz vlss and lofar 61 mhz maps .",
    "both the regions , d1 and d2 , show very steep radio spectra ( @xmath29 ) and spectral breaks which are clear indicators of an ageing nonthermal plasma undergoing radiative cooling . in the case of western region",
    "d2 an ultra steep spectrum of @xmath30 was measured down to 150 mhz .",
    "6 .   in fossil / relic regions d1 and d2 ,",
    "the average minimum energy magnetic field is @xmath31  @xmath32 g for @xmath33 .",
    "the corresponding spectral age of electrons is estimated at @xmath34 y , suggesting a relatively short radiative life time . for @xmath35 the average minimum energy magnetic field",
    "is @xmath36  @xmath32 g and the radiative lifetime @xmath37 y respectively , where k is the ratio of energy in relativistic particles to that in electrons .",
    "the gmrt images of helically twisted and kinked jet system embedding a very tight condensation of nine galactic nuclei near its center points to the possibility of precessional and orbital motion of the agn .",
    "this also suggests possible gravitational perturbation effects of multiple black holes in closely interacting galaxies .",
    "the gmrt map at 610 mhz shows three radio peaks at the central region , of which two ( near the optical positions of galaxies g5 and g2 ) exhibit offset with the jet direction , while the other ( near to g6 ) falls in the middle of the jet .",
    "thus the fainter member g6 appears to host the large scale radio jet .",
    "however , in our present radio observations we can not pin - point conclusively which one ( or more ) of the nine close galaxies gives rise to the overall large scale radio jet system .",
    "the morphological similarity of the jet system in 4c  35.06 with that of precessing jets in galactic microquasar ss 433 is noted , which supports a precessional scenario .",
    "the absence of terminal hot spots and presence of ultra steep spectrum regions on both ends of the jet strongly suggest the continuous shifting of the jet direction , further supporting the precessional model . however , better modelling is required to investigate this scenario . 10 .",
    "the optical spectra of eight galaxies in ` zwicky s nonet ' fail to show any prominent emission lines due to agn , indicating a radiatively inefficient mass accretion flow onto central black holes at sub - eddington rates .",
    "no strong star - formation / star - burst activity is detected either in any of the galaxy spectra .",
    "the time averaged kinetic power of jets in 4c 35.06 is obtained as @xmath38erg  s@xmath20 .",
    "this is below the transition value @xmath39 erg s@xmath20 between fr i and ii classes , but if the jet continues to operate between @xmath40 yr , the injected mechanical energy is @xmath41 erg ; large enough to have a significant impact on the icm . 12 .",
    "black hole masses of the central galaxies have been obtained from the bulge velocity dispersion ( @xmath42 ) and k - band luminosity ( @xmath43 ) correlations .",
    "galaxies g1 , g3 , g5 , g7 , and g9 all host super massive black holes at their centers ( @xmath44 ) , whereas for the fainter members g2 , g4 , and g6 we could only obtain approximate black hole masses within large error bars .",
    "the most massive black hole of mass @xmath45 resides in galaxy g3 which showed a radio loud agn core in previous vlba observations . 13 .",
    "the black hole mass ratio from two methods , i.e. @xmath12 , is found to be @xmath13 for galaxies with well determined masses .",
    "this suggests that possibly @xmath7-@xmath9 method gives systematically smaller black hole masses due to stripping of the outer envelope of some galaxies and thus a reduction in their k - band stellar luminosity .",
    "this is indicative of strong evolution in a hostile galactic environment where violent mergers and stripping of stars in multiple tidal encounters is common , as clearly evidenced by the formation of a large scale stellar halo of stripped matter in ` zwicky s nonet ' .",
    "4c 35.06 , with its rare , bipolar morphology of helically twisted and kinked jets and possessing other striking properties as revealed in our observations , provides an excellent opportunity to understand the energetics and the dynamical evolution of radio jets ejected from agn hosted in a closely interacting multiple galaxy system .",
    "it also help in understanding what possible role agn - feedback plays in heating of icm , transporting and mixing of metals in the icm during the evolution of cd galaxies , and growth of nuclear smbhs .",
    "further high sensitivity and higher resolution radio observations are needed in order to provide a complete spectral analysis and obtain detailed resolved central morphology of this complex source , and map the full extent of its relic regions .",
    "the ultra steep relic regions being faint in nature are very rarely detected in radio galaxies at high frequencies . however , as they shine more at lower frequencies , instruments like the gmrt , lofar and ska are best suited for their discoveries .",
    "perhaps the most important clues for understanding this extraordinary and puzzling radio galaxy originating in an equally complex galactic ensemble would come from detailed observations in x - ray , optical , infra - red and radio wavelengths .",
    "this will allow the complete spectral energy distribution of the galactic system and its agn to be determined . a deep x - ray observation of the hot ,",
    "x - ray emitting gas around the cd galaxy in formation , and detection of the various agn and their x - ray spectra would be very informative .",
    "the spin of the central black hole can be determined by the method of continuum fitting the flux and temperature of the x - ray emission from the accretion disk , while the more robust black hole masses can be obtained via high resolution stellar spectroscopy near the holes sphere of influence .",
    "high resolution vlbi imaging and polarization mapping of the radio jets near the core , in the disk / corona collimation region , and outer regions would be extremely informative in revealing how these jets are launched , interact with the ambient medium and the role of magnetic field in it .",
