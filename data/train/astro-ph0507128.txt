    "to date , more than 20  accreting neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries  ( lmxbs ) are known to exhibit rapid variability in their x - ray fluxes .",
    "these high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) show very strong similarities in their shape , as well as in their amplitude , and span frequencies from  300  hz to about 1300  hz ( see van der klis  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the comparison between high frequency qpos ( hfqpos ) in black holes and neutron stars shows a scaling proportional to  @xmath5 , where  @xmath6 is the mass of the compact object , suggesting that these oscillations are due to the orbital motion in the accretion disk near the innermost stable circular orbit  ( isco ) ( mcclintock & remillard  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the qpo frequencies depend on the spectral state of the source and are correlated with the accretion rate .",
    "qpos are observed in the tail of the power law spectrum indicating that they are not due to thermal emission but probably related to comptonization of soft photons .",
    "the saturation of the spectral index was explained by titarchuk & fiorito  ( @xcite ) in the context of coronal heating and phase transition .",
    "therefore , any qpo model must take not only oscillations in the accretion disk into account but also the way photons propagate to the observer , including photon scattering and general relativistic effects such as beaming , doppler shift , and aberration .",
    "this was investigated by schnittman & bertschinger  ( @xcite ) , who used exact integration of the geodesic motion of hot spots in the kerr spacetime and looked at the harmonic content of the signal received by an observer in the asymptotically flat spacetime .    in black hole binaries ,",
    "the hfqpos appear in pairs , as in the neutron star system , but their frequency remains uncorrelated to the accretion rate .",
    "they act as a voiceprint at a ratio 3:2 that favors a resonance mechanism .",
    "for example a parametric resonance between vertical and horizontal epicyclic frequencies was suggested by kluzniak et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . another mechanism proposed by lee et al  ( @xcite ) is resonance due to an external driven force .",
    "the physics of accretion onto a magnetized neutron star has been described by ghosh & lamb ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this picture close to the star s surface ,",
    "the magnetic field channels matter to the polar caps and exerts a torque on it , which accelerates or decelerates the neutron star depending on the angular momentum exchange rate .",
    "this is the standard model of magnetized accretion onto a neutron star .",
    "however , in order to explain pulsating x - ray sources , anzer & brner  ( @xcite ) propose an alternative view in which the magnetic moment of the neutron star and the accretion disk rotation axis are perpendicular .",
    "they also studied the influence of the kelvin - helmholtz instability on such a configuration  ( anzer & brner  @xcite ) .    when the magnetic moment is misaligned with respect to the spin axis of the star , vietri & stella  ( @xcite )",
    "show that some inhomogeneities , treated as diamagnetic blobs , could be lifted off the disk and suffer the lense - thirring precession .",
    "lai  ( @xcite ) has identified a magnetically driven warping and precession instability that occurs in the inner region of an accretion disk .",
    "this occurs by interaction between the surface current density in the disk with the stellar magnetic field and produces motions at frequencies much lower than the orbital one .",
    "it can , therefore , account for the low frequency qpos  ( lfqpos ) , as does the usual lense - thirring precession ( stella & vietri  @xcite ) . magnetic precession , combined with the relativistic dragging effect , was applied to weakly magnetized neutron stars to explain these lfqpos in lmxbs , ( shirakawa & lai  @xcite ) .",
    "the study of the global magnetic warping / precession process for strongly magnetized neutron stars can also explain the millihertz qpos in some systems , see for example shirakawa & lai  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rayleigh - taylor instability associated with rossby waves and the rotational splitting gives another self - consistent description of the qpo phenomenon ( titarchuk  @xcite ) .",
    "it was realized by kato  ( @xcite , @xcite ) that non - axisymmetric g - mode oscillations can be trapped in a thin relativistic disk .",
    "these are excited by the corotation resonance .",
    "the effect of non - linear coupling between oscillations in the disk and warp is examined by kato  ( @xcite ) . however",
    ", his study does not include the rotation of the compact object .",
    "recent observations of accretion disks orbiting white dwarfs , neutron stars , or black holes have shown a strong correlation between the low and high frequency qpos , lfqpos and hfqpos respectively , ( psaltis et al .",
    "@xcite , mauche  @xcite , belloni et al  @xcite ) .",
    "this relation holds over more than 6  orders of magnitude and strongly supports the idea that the qpo phenomenon is a universal physical process independent of the nature of the compact object .",
    "indeed , the presence or absence of a solid surface , a magnetic field , or an event horizon plays no relevant role in the production of x - ray variability  ( wijnands  @xcite ) . this correlation has instead been explained in terms of the centrifugal barrier model of titarchuk et al .",
    "( @xcite ) where the lfqpos are associated with magneto - acoustic waves , and the hfqpos correspond to the keplerian motion in the disk .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new resonance in the star - disk system arising from the response of the accretion disk to a non - axisymmetric rotating magnetic field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : equinit ] , we describe the initial equilibrium state where the accretion disk is embedded in an axisymmetric magnetic field anchored to the neutron star .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the magnetic moment is aligned with the rotation axis of the star .",
    "we then estimate the field perturbation induced by a small inclination of the magnetic moment . in sec .",
    "[ sec : anallin ] , we look for the resonance conditions and elucidate the meaning of the resonances . for a thin and weakly magnetized accretion disk , assuming no warp and only motion in the orbital plane of the disk , we investigate the precise linear behavior of the disk which is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : thindisk ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulation ] , we perform 2d numerical mhd simulations of the disk and show that some resonances persist on a long timescale with a narrow radial extension .",
    "this is done for newtonian , as well as for pseudo - general relativistic gravitational potential describing the kerr geometry in a newtonian way adapted to a rotating neutron star .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in the equilibrium state , the accretion disk evolves in a perfectly spherically symmetric gravitational field and an axisymmetric dipolar magnetic field , both due to the compact object .",
    "we assume that the magnetic moment of the star and its rotational axis are aligned .",
    "the disk is assumed to lie in the equatorial plane of the star so that it experiences an axisymmetric stationary field . by adopting a cylindrical coordinate system labeled by  @xmath7",
    ", we can therefore describe all physical quantities with only a  @xmath8 dependence . neglecting the matter inflow because in the thin disk approximation  @xmath9 and because we only focus on oscillations around a stationary state , the density  @xmath10 , pressure  @xmath11 , current density  @xmath12 , velocity  @xmath13 , and magnetic field  @xmath14 at equilibrium",
    "are thus given by  : @xmath15 the magnetic field has two different origins  :    * one component  @xmath16 is attached to the neutron star and corresponds to the rotating stellar dipolar magnetic field  ; * the second component  @xmath17 of the magnetic field is induced by the fluid motion in the accretion disk and follows from ampere s law  @xmath18 .",
    "the total magnetic field is then simply the sum of these two components  @xmath19 .    in the radial direction , the gravitational attraction from the compact object  @xmath20",
    "is balanced by the centrifugal force , the lorentz force , and the pressure gradient , whereas in the vertical direction we simply have hydromagnetic equilibrium  : @xmath21 to specify a given equilibrium state , we prescribe the initial density and current , or , equivalently , the magnetic field in the disk and the strength of the dipolar magnetic field of the neutron star . assuming a thin accretion disk and a low  @xmath22-plasma parameter , defined as @xmath23 the pressure gradient and lorentz forces will be negligible compared to the gravitational force .",
    "the motion will then only deviate slightly from keplerian rotation .",
    "we then perturb the system by adding a small inclination angle  @xmath24 between the magnetic and rotational axis of the star . as a consequence , and due to the magnetic perturbation",
    ", the disk will leave its equilibrium state and start to oscillate around the equatorial plane .",
    "we next give the expression for the stellar magnetic field perturbation .",
    "in the case of an aligned rotator ,  @xmath25 , the magnetic field is axisymmetric .",
    "therefore , in the disk plane , there is only a vertical component  @xmath26 . when the magnetic moment  @xmath27 is inclined by an angle  @xmath28 relative to rotation axis  @xmath29 , an additional magnetic component dragged by the star s rotation arises .",
    "this perturbation is responsible for the oscillation in the disk .",
    "we derive its expression below .",
    "the magnetic moment can be developed into a parallel ( along  @xmath30 ) and a perpendicular ( along  @xmath31 ) component such that @xmath32 where  @xmath31 is a radial unitary vector corotating with the star . in the cartesian",
    "coordinates of a distant observer at rest  @xmath33 , it can be expressed as @xmath34 assuming that at  @xmath35 @xmath36 .",
    "we adopt a particular geometric configuration corresponding to the situation where the disk is contained in the star s equatorial plane .",
    "we could generalize to the case where magnetic moment , disk , and star rotation axis are all misaligned .",
    "however , the rotational frequency of the magnetic perturbation , which is its most important property , would not be affected .",
    "the angular rotation is assumed to be equal to  @xmath37 .",
    "the stellar dipolar magnetic field has the usual expression derived from the vector potential @xmath38 therefore , the perturbation is  @xmath39 .",
    "it represents a perpendicular rotator with magnetic moment  @xmath40 .",

    "this situation will be studied in detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the nature of the perturbation has some consequences for the derivation of the resonance conditions , as shown in the following  sec.[sec : anallin ] .",

    "( [ eq : rescorot])-([eq : respara ] ) . on the one hand , these blobs can persist during thousands of orbital revolutions and can account for the high quality factor  q seen in some high frequency - qpos . on the other ,",
    "the pattern speed of the free wave solutions is closely related to the location of the inner boundary of the accretion disk .",
    "the observed shift in the hfqpos in response to the accretion rate can be explained by these solutions .",
    "this study should be extended to include viscosity of the gas flowing in the disk , which should set a lower limit to the magnetic field perturbation amplitude in order to have parametric resonance .",
    "in addition , the loss of energy by radiation should also damp these oscillations and select only a few of them , which will also permit estimation of the light curves of such systems .",
    "the relation between the simulations presented in this paper and observations will be investigated in a forthcoming paper , in which we show how to calculate the power spectrum density ( psd ) of the accretion disk .",
    "the prediction of the psd will be crucial for validation of the model .",
    "we would like to emphasize that this work is only a preliminary study undertaken to prove that a rotating asymmetric magnetic field leads to some interesting resonance mechanisms . the toy model used here",
    "can not be applied directly to observations .",
    "indeed , many aspects , such as the warping / precession of the disk expected in 3d simulations , as well as viscosity and radiation , should be taken into account in a more realistic model .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that this idea can also be applied to the lmxbs containing a black hole . indeed , it seems that the existence of qpos in black hole candidates is correlated with the detection of a jet emanating from these systems , ( mcclintock & remillard  @xcite ) . the blandford - znajek process ( blandford & znajek  @xcite ) converting the rotational energy of the black hole into the launching of the jet should also be responsible for a connection between the accretion disk and the black hole via the magnetic field .",

    "<S> quasi - periodic oscillations  ( qpos ) have been observed in accretion disks around neutron star , black hole , and white dwarf binaries with frequencies ranging from a few  0.1  hz up to 1300  hz . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a correlation between their low- and high - frequency components was discovered and fitted with a single law , irrespective of the nature of the compact object . that such a relation holds over 6  orders of magnitude strongly supports the idea that the physical mechanism responsible for these oscillations should be the same in all binary systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new model for these qpos based on forced oscillations induced in the accretion disk due to the stellar magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> first , it is shown that a magnetized accretion disk evolving in a rotating nonaxisymmetric magnetic field anchored to a neutron star will be subject to three kinds of resonances : a corotation resonance , a lindblad resonance due to a driving force , and a parametric resonance due to the time varying epicyclic frequencies . the asymmetric part of the field is assumed to contain only one azimuthal mode  @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the  @xmath1 disturbance , which is well studied for an inclined dipolar rotator ; but our results are general and easily extend to  @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the radial location of the resonances will be affected by this number  @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , with an  @xmath1 asymmetric structure , the resonances reach regions very close to the innermost stable circular orbit  ( isco ) and can account for observations of khz - qpos at frequencies as high as  1200 - 1300  hz . </S>",
    "<S> if we replace the dipolar by a higher order multipolar component , the resonance location is shifted to larger radius , implying lower qpo frequencies . to compare the mhd situation with the hydrodynamical case </S>",
    "<S> , we also consider an  @xmath4 component in the magnetic perturbation in order to prove that , at least in the linear regime , the conclusions in both cases are the same . in the second part of the paper , we focus on the linear response of a thin accretion disk , developing the density perturbation as the sum of free wave solutions and non - wavelike disturbances . in the last part , </S>",
    "<S> we show results of 2d numerical simulations of a simplified version of the accretion disk consisting of a column of plasma threaded by a vertical magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> these simulations are performed for the newtonian gravitational potential , as well as for a pseudo - general relativistic potential , which enables us to explore the behavior of the resonances around both rotating neutron stars and black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the density perturbations are only significant in the region located close to the inner edge of the disk near the isco where the magnetic perturbation is maximal . </S>",
    "<S> they induce fluctuations in the density which persist over the whole time of the simulations and are closely related to the spin of the magnetic perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that the nearly periodic motion induced in the disk will produce high quality factor qpos . </S>"
