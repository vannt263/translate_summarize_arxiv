    "the atoms localize and the system becomes a mott insulator .",
    "it is important to address the issue of how the lattice - induced correlations affect the transport in between these two limits , as the system is tuned from the weakly - interacting regime to the strongly interacting one .    in order to achieve this goal",
    ", we employ the quasi - exact density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method using a matrix product state ( mps ) ansatz for the wavefunction .",
    "recently the static dmrg method has been applied to the study of the bose - hubbard model phase diagram under the influence of artificial gauge fields  @xcite . as a step",
    "further we study the evolution in time using the time - dependent dmrg algorithm ( tdmrg )  @xcite within the microcanonical picture of transport  @xcite , which is ideal to study transport phenomena in closed finite systems as the present ones .",
    "we concentrate on the case of ultracold bosons in a one - dimensional optical lattice with a superimposed external confining potential which is constant throughout the system and rises sharply at the boundary .",
    "hard - wall confining potentials of this kind are not common in ultracold atoms where harmonic confining potentials are the norm , but have been recently realized  @xcite , and the ground state properties of uniform condensates have been measured  @xcite .",

    "we use the quasi - exact tdmrg to extract the quasi - steady state current as a function of filling and interaction strength and we argue that in fact this corresponds to measuring the drude weight  @xcite . ultimately this technique can be used to infer the drude weight or , possibly , the superfluid fraction in real experiments in a simple way . near the superfluid - mott insulator transition",

    "while a rarefaction wave with the same height forms at the right boundary . ]",
    "another important quantity characterizing the quasi - steady state is the entanglement entropy between two parts of the system .",
    "recently it has been found that the rate at which entanglement entropy is generated between two fermi seas is related to the noise statistics of the current through a quantum point contact that couples the two reservoirs  @xcite . since",
    "fluctuations can be accessed in the ultracold gases counterpart of solid state transport experiments  @xcite , we report results for the entanglement entropy production rate in the bose - hubbard model driven by a quench in the hopping phase and we find that the entropy production rate is non - zero only around the superfluid - mott insulator transition .",
    "this can serve as an alternative way to detect the transition in experiments .",
    "the quasi - steady state is not expected to persist indefinitely in a system with hard - wall boundary conditions . in our case",
    "we observe that shock and rarefaction waves form at the boundaries and propagate toward the center of the chain as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : one_1]*b*. we assume that the continuously shrinking middle region in between the two waves is a good approximation of a true steady state , since the current reaches its stationary value on a short time scale and is independent of the position within the same region .",
    "moreover , in recent experiments  @xcite it has been observed that perturbations ( in our case the boundary effects ) propagate at a finite speed , in a light cone manner .",

    "the piston problem for dispersive shock waves has been considered recently for a fluid described by the nonlinear schrdinger equation  @xcite .",
    "we find that , regardless of the presence of the lattice , dispersive shock and rarefaction waves form whenever the system is a superfluid , but not in the mott insulator . from our simulations",

    "fig : one_1]*b * ) .",
    "we conclude that dispersive waves are a general signature of the superfluid .",
    "we emphasize that the formation of such waves is a consequence of the hard wall potentials at the boundaries .",
    "if the system is confined in a harmonic trap , the same kind of quench would simply trigger a periodic oscillation of the center of mass , eventually damped by lattice effects  @xcite , but waves do not form .",
    "note that recent works have focused on the dynamics of fermi- and bose - hubbard models under a constant force  @xcite .",
    "the quench protocol considered here is distinct and leads to a quite different dynamics .",
    "the difference with respect to the case of an applied constant force for @xmath15 is that the quench considered here corresponds to a large force applied for a short time ( impulsive force ) , after which the system evolves freely .",
    "a constant force applied to a lattice system generally leads to bloch oscillations of the gas center of mass  @xcite , but no such oscillations have been observed in our case . on the other hand ,",

    "section  [ sec : bh ] briefly reviews the bose - hubbard model and provides details on the tdmrg method used to study it . in section  [ sec : noninteracting ]",
    "the limiting cases of noninteracting bosons and fermions are discussed , as well as the mapping of the bose - hubbard model into the xxz spin chain . in section",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] the bulk properties ( away from the boundaries ) of the quasi - steady state are considered , namely current ( sec .  [ sec : steady ] ) , drude weight ( sec .",

    "the filling @xmath28 is controlled by the number of particles @xmath29 in the lattice .",
    "we report the results for the following selected values of the filling : @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) . the gas is confined only by the hard - wall boundaries and",
    "the external potential in the bulk of the system is uniform ( @xmath36 in eq .   and  ) .",
    "experimentally this has been realized using two sheet laser beams that create sharp repulsive potentials at the boundaries  @xcite .",
    "the system is initially prepared in the ground state of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham ] ) without any vector potential [ @xmath37 .",
    "an artificial vector potential is suddenly applied to the system so that the hopping coefficient acquires a finite phase @xmath38 .",
    "a phase quench amounts to a rearrangement of energy eigenstates so the system is driven out of equilibrium .",
    "we consider two values for the post - quench phase : a small value @xmath39 and a large one @xmath40 .    in the tdmrg simulations",
    "the link dimension @xmath41 of the mps matrices is adjusted automatically in time and space by requiring a fixed truncation error of @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath41 is not allowed to be larger than @xmath43 during the ground state optimization and @xmath44 during the dynamics in the case of the small phase quench .",
    "a larger @xmath41 is used during the dynamics in order accommodate the entanglement generated as the system is driven out of equilibrium .",
    "we use the upper limits @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the static and dynamic dmrg respectively , in the case of the large phase quench since the entanglement is generally larger for a system that is driven farther out of equilibrium .",
    "occasionally we observed that the required truncation error is not always met during the evolution because of the upper limit on @xmath41 .",
    "however , we have verified that the local observables that we are interested in , namely the density , current and entanglement entropy , are only slightly affected by the larger truncation error and the level of precision provided by the above parameters is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "the tdmrg results are also compared to a time - dependent mean - field approximation based on the _ grand - canonical _ gutzwiller ansatz  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , an mps with _ link dimension _ @xmath47 .",
    "the gutzwiller wavefunction has been evolved in time with a variation of the tdmrg algorithm as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we find a remarkably close agreement away from the mott insulator state , a useful information since the the gutzwiller ansatz is much less computationally demanding than full tdmrg simulations .",
    "before analysing the tdmrg results we briefly discuss the noninteracting limits of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham ] ) focusing first on the transition between noninteracting ( @xmath48 ) and interacting ( @xmath49 ) bosons .",
    "the ground state of noninteracting bosons with a fixed number of particles shows different features when compared to that of bosons with finite interactions @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "the former is a condensate with all the particles occupying the lowest available state , which in the case of a box potential in 1d has a density profile @xmath51 , while for bosons with a finite @xmath50 the density profile is flat in a finite region in the middle of the system for large enough @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , a phase transition occurs when @xmath50 is changed from exactly zero to any finite value . to see this",
    "explicitly we note that for small values of the interaction strength the bose - hubbard model is well approximated by a continuum field theory of bosons with delta function interaction @xmath52  @xcite known as the lieb - liniger model  @xcite . in the following",
    "we will frequently use the density - rescaled interaction strenth @xmath53 which coincides with the lieb - liniger parameter @xmath54",
    "@xcite ( @xmath41 is the particle mass and @xmath55 the density in the continuum ) . a gas can be considered weakly interacting if @xmath56 while it is strongly interacting if @xmath57 .",
    "the bose - fermi mapping valid for _ arbitrary _ values of @xmath58 ensures that bosons in the continuum are equivalent to fermions with a @xmath59-wave interaction @xmath60 where @xmath61 ( with @xmath41 the particle mass )  @xcite .",
    "discretizing the fermionic hamiltonian results in  @xcite @xmath62 with fermionic annihilation and creation operators @xmath63,@xmath64 and density operator @xmath65 .",

    "the xxz model is gapped when the anisotropy parameter @xmath66 satisfies @xmath67 and it is gapless otherwise .",
    "the transition point from noninteracting to interacting bosons in the original bose - hubbard model corresponds to @xmath68 , the ferromagnetic transition of the xxz model .",
    "this phase transition is reflected in the absence of a stationary steady state with finite current in the thermodynamic limit of noninteracting bosons  @xcite .",
    "as shown in the following this is particularly evident in the case of a large phase quench .",
    "the fermionic hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xxz ] ) is equivalent to the bose - hubbard model ( [ eq : ham ] ) only in the low filling limit since the bose - fermi mapping for 1d particles in the continuum has been implemented as an intermediate step .",

    "( [ eq : xxz ] ) is integrable for any value of @xmath69 while the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) is not .",

    "below we will compare the dynamics for finite @xmath69 with that of hardcore bosons .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : two ] the time evolution of the current in the middle of the chain is shown in the case of both small ( fig .",

    "the current is extracted from the simulations as the expectation value of the current operator @xmath73 and is positive if the particles move from the right to the left of the lattice . immediately after the quench",
    "the current reaches a constant value with negligible fluctuations and this corresponds to the formation of a quasi - steady state .",
    "large oscillations set in after a time that depends on the system size and interaction strength .",
    "we emphasize that the formation of a quasi - steady state is not restricted to the low filling limit with emergent galilean invariance , or to the integrable limit of hardcore bosons ( see section  [ sec : noninteracting ] ) , but is a generic feature of the superfluid state of interacting bosons in 1d lattices .",
    "it is in fact the signature of a nonzero drude weight ( section  [ sec : drude ] ) . in the mott insulator regime",
    "there is no finite steady - state current , as expected .    the large oscillations at later times shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] are a manifestation of the complex dynamics in a finite system with boundaries where the time - evolved density is no longer constant and the steady state can not be maintained .",
    "ultimately , all of the gas is reflected back at the boundary towards which the current is directed , leading to a _ current inversion_. the data for long enough times ( if available ) show a region of an essentially constant current with equal magnitude but opposite sign compared the plateau immediately after the quench .",
    "thus the gas not only propagates ballistically in the lattice but is also reflected in a perfectly elastic way at the left boundary .",
    "the current inversion occurs earlier for higher values of @xmath69 .",

    ".    the time scales that can be explored in the case of a large phase quench are much shorter with respect to the small phase quench due to the faster build up of entanglement during the evolution , which is largest at the left boundary where the shock wave forms .",

    "@xcite shows that a quasi - steady state of noninteracting fermions is also characterized by a constant entropy production rate . for noninteracting fermions",
    "the rate estimated from the semiclassical full counting statstics @xcite is a function of the transmission coefficient of the junction through which the current flows : @xmath127\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath128 is the chemical potential difference ( whose role is played by @xmath92 here ) and @xmath129 is the transmission coefficient .    in our simulations of interacting bosons we found that @xmath130 in the superfluid phase .",
    "interestingly , this agrees with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ent_rate ] ) and the full quantum - mechanical simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite for noninteracting fermions .",
    "since we consider a uniform lattice without any constriction in the middle junction , the transmission coefficient is @xmath131 so noninteracting fermions do not produce further entanglement entropy .",
    "a similar reason may account for the behavior of interacting bosons in the superfluid phase .",
    "in contrast , a finite entropy production rate is present around the superfluid - mott insulator transition at @xmath74 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : five ] .",
    "although the entanglement entropy of the initial ground state at @xmath4 is a decreasing function of @xmath69 , during the dynamics the entanglement entropy production rate reaches a maximum around the critical point .",
    "in fact we see from the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : five ] that the rate jumps from essentially zero below the critical point to a finite value right above the critical point .",
    "this indicates that the correlation between the two parts of the system increases in the mott insulator phase close to the critical point after a quench in the external gauge field .",
    "this feature of the entanglement entropy may serve as another sharp indicator of the superfluid - mott insulator transition .",
    "( color online ) in the upper panels we show the entropy as a function of time @xmath126 relative to the bipartition of the system in two halves .",
    "the plots from top to bottom correspond to increasing interaction strength ( @xmath132 decreases with increasing @xmath69 ) . on the left results for small phase quench @xmath39 are shown and on the right for the large phase quench @xmath87 . in the lower plots the corresponding values of the entropy production rate @xmath133 ( in units of @xmath26 ) at time @xmath111 ( left ) and @xmath134 ( right ) are reported as a function of the interaction strength .",
    "the filled circles correspond to the values of @xmath69 shown in the upper plots .",
    "the vertical dotted lines indicate the critical value of the interaction strength @xmath135 .",
    "all of the data refer to filling @xmath117 . ]",
    "in the previous section we have analyzed the current , the drude weight , and the entanglement entropy that are properties characterizing the bulk of the system .",
    "we now concentrate on the time evolution of the density profile @xmath136 after the quench , especially near to the boundary .",
    "the case of a small phase quench @xmath39 is discussed first .",
    "the density profile dynamics is qualitatively similar everywhere in the superfluid region , i.e. , away from the mott insulator state that occurs for @xmath75 and commensurate filling @xmath74 , and it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : one_1]*b * and in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : six ] . at the boundaries two density steps",
    "form with magnitude @xmath137 , where this latter quantity is defined in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : one_1]*b*. for a current flowing toward the left of the system the density step on the left is positive and is connected to the constant background in the middle by a _ shock wave _  @xcite which approximately retains its shape as it propagates in the direction opposite to the bulk current . on the right side",
    "the density step is negative and is connected to the background by a region where the slope of the density profile decreases in time ( at low filling ) , _ i.e. _ , a _ rarefaction wave _  @xcite .",
    "shock and rarefaction waves play an important role in the dynamics of ultracold gases , but despite much effort they are still poorly understood ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    the definition of the step height @xmath138 provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : one_1 ] is relatively insensitive to the time @xmath139 and the lattice site @xmath140 at which it is evaluated provided that ( i ) @xmath140 is a site in between ( and sufficiently far from both ) the boundary and the shock front , and ( ii ) at time @xmath139 the front has traveled a long enough distance . the only exception is right above the transition where no well - defined plateau appears . the value of @xmath137 reported for @xmath112 in fig .",
    "[ fig : six]*c * gives an estimate of the magnitude of the density perturbation induced by the quench , as shown in the inset , but this is not the height of a well - defined density step as for all other points .",
    "the absence of shock and rarefaction waves is a sensitive dynamical probe of the mott insulator which can be measured in experiments with uniform gases  @xcite .",
    "the density profile is measurable in experiments and the current can be inferred from it at different times using the protocol outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the gutzwiller ansatz is capable of capturing the step height quite well as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : six ] , except at the transition between the superfluid state and the mott insulator .",
    "this discrepancy is similar to the one observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] .",
    "it appears that above the transition to the mott insulator state the correlations , which are not well captured by the mean - field gutzwiller ansatz , are crucial in obtaining the correct dynamics .",
    "the density step height @xmath11 can be used to estimate by current conservation the velocity of propagation of the front @xmath141 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : one_1]*b * ) according to the formula @xmath142 where the bulk velocity @xmath10 and bulk current @xmath143 have been considered in sec .  [",
    "sec : steady ] and  [ sec : drude ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : seven ] we show the propagation speed of the shock waves at the left as a function of the parameter @xmath80 .",
    "the results of the numerical simulations are compared with the sound velocity for a weakly interacting bose gas @xmath144  @xcite .",
    "the shock propagates at a speed which is very close to the sound one at low filling .",
    "the sound speed at higher filling still provides a good order of magnitude estimate of the shock wave propagation speed . for low values of @xmath101 the relation @xmath145 holds in general , but eventually the opposite inequality takes place for large enough @xmath101 . in the case @xmath146 the slope of @xmath141 becomes negative for @xmath147 .",
    "a qualitative explanation of why the shock wave speed is close or slightly larger than the sound speed , at least for small interaction strength , remains a challenge . only in the low",
    "filling ( continuum limit ) the propagation speed and the density step of the shock wave are controlled by the dispersive analogue  @xcite of the hugoniot loci for classical shock waves  @xcite since viscosity is extremely low in ultracold gases .",
    "whereas in the case of the current , drude weight , and entanglement entropy the results obtained with the small and large phase quenches are quite similar , this is not the case for the time evolution of the density profile at the boundaries .",
    "no well defined density steps and propagating wavefronts have been observed for @xmath148 .",
    "the main difference is that the _ shock structure _",
    "@xcite ( i.e. the region connecting the constant density plateaus ) is more broad in this case and exhibit a more pronounced oscillatory structure typical of dispersive shock waves  @xcite .",
    "in fact this is in agreement with the solution of the piston problem for a dispersive fluid  @xcite .",
    "it is predicted that for large enough piston velocity ( analogous to the post - quench hopping phase @xmath92 in our case ) a bifurcation of the dynamics occurs and instead of a constant density plateau a locally periodic wave train is generated . therefore @xmath11 and @xmath12 can not be defined .",
    "this is another indication that a superfluid is in fact a dispersive inviscid fluid .",
    "( color online ) the shock wave propagation speed @xmath149 ( triangles ) for different initial fillings ( @xmath150 from bottom to top ) compared to the sound speed in a weakly interacting bose gas @xmath151 ( circles ) as a function of the density - rescaled interaction strength @xmath80 . ]",
    "this work presents our studies of quasi - steady states of interacting bosons in a 1d optical lattice after a quench of an artificial gauge field .",
    "we studied the full crossover between the low filling ( continuum limit ) up to commensurate filling @xmath117 where a mott insulator forms for strong enough interaction strength . in the superfluid state",
    "we find that once a finite momentum transfer is delivered to the system , shock and rarefaction waves form at the hard - wall boundaries that break the lattice translational invariance .",
    "we characterized the shock waves by the density step height and the speed of the ballistic propagation of the wave front .",
    "the dynamics is rather different in the mott insulator as the current is suppressed .",
    "the absence of well defined shock and rarefaction wave is a readily measurable dynamical feature of the mott insulator .",
    "another interesting dynamical property is that at the critical point between the mott insulator and the superfluid the entanglement entropy production rate is maximal .",
    "we present data for the bulk current of interacting bose gases and study the lattice - induced correlations that lead to its decay with increasing filling and interaction strength .",
    "the current is found to be proportional to the drude weight of the system and thereby we establish a possible experimental probe of this quantity by using the time - dependent density profiles as an input .",
    "a question for future research is if the quasi - steady state current after a quench is related to the superfluid fraction in the case of nonzero temperature and higher dimensionality .",
    "an affirmative answer to this question would allow to measure in an exceedingly simple way the superfluid fraction of an ultracold atomic gas , a very important property .",
    "we have considered also a quench with a large value of the post - quench hopping phase .",
    "while bulk properties such as current , drude weight and entanglement entropy are essentially the same for small and large phase quenches , the behavior at the boundaries is very different in agreement with recent theoretical predictions  @xcite . in the case of a large phase",
    "quench it is possible to observe a sharp transition in the formation of a quasi - steady state away from the noninteracting - boson limit @xmath48 which serves as a dynamical signature for the phase transition between noninteracting and interacting bosons .",
    "finally , the existence of a quasi - steady state current in interacting bosons paves the way for studying interesting transport phenomena in bosonic systems .",

    "<S> recent experimental realizations of artificial gauge fields for cold atoms are promising for generating steady states carrying a mass current in strongly correlated systems , such as the bose - hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a homogeneous condensate confined by hard - wall potentials from laser sheets has been demonstrated , which provides opportunities for probing the intrinsic transport properties of isolated quantum systems . using the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( tdmrg ) </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the effect of the lattice and interaction strength on the current generated by a quench in the artificial vector potential when the density varies from low values ( continuum limit ) up to integer filling in the mott - insulator regime . </S>",
    "<S> there is no observable mass current deep in the mott - insulator state as one may expect . </S>",
    "<S> other observable quantities used to characterize the quasi - steady state in the bulk of the system are the drude weight and entanglement entropy production rate . </S>",
    "<S> the latter in particular provides a striking signature of the superfluid - mott insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , an interesting property of the superfluid state is the formation of shock and rarefaction waves at the boundaries due to the hard - wall confining potentials . </S>",
    "<S> we provide results for the height and the speed of the shock front that propagates from the boundary toward the center of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> our results should be verifiable with current experimental capabilities . </S>"
