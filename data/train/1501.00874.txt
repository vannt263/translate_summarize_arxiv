    "mass loss is known to dominate the evolution on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "however , the slower evolution of stars with @xmath5 m@xmath6 means more mass is lost during the red giant branch ( rgb ) phase than on the agb .",
    "rgb mass loss has been much less studied , partly because it has only minor effects on rgb evolution . however , it is crucial for later evolution , setting the stellar temperature on the horizontal branch ( hb ) and dictating the length and path of its agb evolution .",
    "rgb mass loss is a component of most stellar evolution codes , and is generally parameterised by simple relations of the stellar parameters ( e.g.  luminosity ( @xmath7 ) , radius ( @xmath8 ) , mass ( @xmath9 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath10 ) , effective temperature ( @xmath11 ) , etc . ) .",
    "the two parameterisations most commonly used are those of @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sc05 ) , which we examine in this work .",
    "however , use of these laws requires a fiducial reference point , parameterised by a scaling factor , @xmath2 , which determines the constant of proportionality in these scaling laws .",
    "calibrating @xmath2 is important in understanding the post - rgb stages of low - mass stellar evolution , particularly if @xmath2 varies with other stellar parameters , such as stellar metallicity .",
    "no direct variation of metallicity is included in the reimers and sc05 relations , however metallicity indirectly affects the parameterised mass - loss rate through the consequent variation of stellar radius and the speed at which the star evolves . mass loss from rgb stars is thought to occur via ( magneto-)acoustic processes , hence it should be largely independent of metallicity .",
    "if a parameterisation like those of @xcite and sc05 provides is an accurate representation of the mass - loss rates of rgb stars , we can expect @xmath2 to be independent of metallicity too .",
    "rgb mass loss is notoriously difficult to measure , relying mainly on three tracers .",
    "blueshifted components in optical and near - ir lines trace mass motions close to the stellar surface , but this does not necessarily translate into the rate at which mass is ejected from the star ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "sub - mm co line strengths trace material far from the star , but for rgb stars is only sensitive to the handful nearest earth ( e.g.  @xcite ) . infrared excesses trace dust in the wind , but are hard to measure conclusively and difficult to translate from a dust mass - loss rate to a total mass - loss rate , besides which little ( if any ) dust production is expected on the rgb ( @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein )",
    ". a better way to measure mass loss is to obtain a difference in stellar mass between two points in its evolution , and use this to determine a scaling parameter , such as @xmath2 .",
    "this avoids many of the systematic uncertainties which limit the above methods and averages out any short - term variations in the mass - loss rate .",
    "few places offer such unique laboratories to study rgb mass loss as globular clusters . as comparatively simple , resolved stellar systems , we can probe the properties of their individual stars with accurately known distances , metallicities , abundances and ages . the stellar mass and evolutionary history can easily be determined for individual stars .",
    "measuring the mass of horizontal branch stars in globular clusters allows us to determine the @xmath2 appropriate for @xmath120.8-m@xmath6 stars over their previous evolution .",
    "determining @xmath2 is also important in solving the so - called second parameter problem @xcite .",
    "hb morphology of galactic globular clusters is largely set by a single parameter ( stellar metallicity ) .",
    "however , a second parameter is needed to explain the variations in morphological structure among clusters of a similar metallicity",
    ". cluster age and helium abundance can both affect cluster morphology .",
    "* hereafter gcb+10 ) find cluster age can account for most of the remaining differences .",
    "if metallicity and age account for the entirety of hb morphology , we should expect little variation in @xmath2 among different clusters , as both age and metallicity are taken into account in the stellar evolution models we will use .    this manuscript is structured as follows : in section [ datasect ] we collate the existing hb star masses , stellar compositions and cluster ages required to compute @xmath2 .",
    "we also discuss the models we use to describe mass loss from rgb stars . in section [ evolsect ]",
    "we describe existing and new stellar evolution models used to derive the mass - loss histories of each cluster s stars . in section [ analsect ]",
    "we calculate our final values of @xmath2 and their uncertainties . in section [ discsect ] , we compare these results to previous empirical and semi - empirical determinations , discuss their implications for the evolution of agb stars in globular clusters , and the veracity of the variations with metallicity we find .    during the course of writing this manuscript , it was found that publsihed stellar evolution codes were insufficient for our purposes .",
    "this led us to produce the new evolutionary tracks described in section [ evolsect ] .",
    "the application of all stellar evolution models impart poorly quantified errors to the results .",
    "we have quoted estimates for these errors in the text , but provide appendices which contain more detailed discussion . in appendix [ agessect ] we explore the various determinations of cluster ages . in appendix [ modelssect ]",
    "we compare our new evolutionary tracks to other models . in appendix [ trackcomparesect ]",
    "we discuss various errors associated with our derivation of @xmath2 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our derived values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are in good agreement with previous literature . sc05",
    "derive both @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the clusters m5 ( ngc 5904 ) and ngc 5927 .",
    "their results are summarised in table [ sctable ] . both clusters values for @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "are consistent within the combined error budgets .",
    "further comparison can be made to field stars : @xcite model 47 galactic stars , finding @xmath15 ( with a presumed uncertainty of 0.0125 ) : also consistent within the combined error budget .",
    "the precise value of both @xmath13 and @xmath14 one derives depends on the treatment of the uppermost parts of the red giant branch , where mass - loss rates reach @xmath122 @xmath16 m@xmath17 yr@xmath18 .",
    "we have tried to incorporate reasonable errors by comparing several stellar evolution codes in our analysis , however it is not clear which stellar evolution model sc05 use .",
    "discussions brought up during the refereeing process of this work have highlighted the need for a proper treatment of stellar mass loss within the comparison code .",
    "while the uncertainties due to variation of giant branch mass loss within the stellar evolution codes are incorporated into our systematic error , their precise treatment can alter the value of @xmath2 significantly . for comparison",
    ", we have repeated our derivation of @xmath2 with the dartmouth isochrones , which do not include mass loss while the stars are on the rgb .",
    "the dartmouth - based @xmath2 is calculated as the substantially higher @xmath19 and @xmath20 due to its hotter rgb tip and altered rgb lifetime ( see appendix [ mesacomparesect ] ) .",
    "the mass of a star can be calculated from observables using the formula : @xmath21 for measurements of individual stars , fractional uncertainties in both @xmath7 and @xmath22 can be as little as @xmath123 per cent .",
    "however , purely spectroscopic derivations of @xmath23 are normally uncertain by a factor of three or more .",
    "this make it difficult to achieve sufficiently accurate masses for individual stars , particularly absolutely calibrated masses .",
    "however , computing the difference in mass between two populations of stars from the same observation is possible .",
    "this method has the advantage of being largely insensitive to the helium abundance of the star .    in collaboration with c.  i.  johnson ,",
    "we have previously adopted this approach to measure the difference between early agb stars and rgb stars of similar luminosity in @xmath24 centauri , measuring a 26 @xmath25 4 per cent decrease in mass from the rgb to agb @xcite . assuming a 12-gyr - old cluster at [ fe / h ] = 1.62 , this equates to 0.21 @xmath25 0.03 m@xmath6 , which compares favourably with the 0.23 m@xmath6 expected using our fit to reimers law with @xmath13 = 0.477 .",
    "similarly favourable results can be found in 47 tuc , by combining the photometric temperatures and luminosities of @xcite with the spectroscopic log(@xmath23 ) measurements of rgb stars by @xcite and of agb stars by johnson et al .",
    "( submitted ) .",
    "although the errors from these more - direct measurements are still considerable , they constrain the possible range of @xmath13 to between @xmath120.30 to @xmath120.60 , re - enforcing the values we derive here .",
    "the @xmath2 we have calculated above should also apply in later evolution , as the stars are thought to continue to lose mass via the same mechanisms well into their agb evolution . in this section ,",
    "we follow our stellar evolution models onto the agb and compare their predictions to observations of agb stars in globular clusters .",
    "highly evolved stars are thought to lose mass primarily through pulsation - enhanced , dust - driven winds .",
    "pulsations in the stellar atmosphere levitate material which can condense into dust ; radiation pressure on this dust forces it from the star . however , the criteria for this to be the primary ejection mechanism are poorly determined , partly depending on the strength of the pulsation and the opacity of the dust ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in the early stages of this regime , where pulsation and dust production are visible but yet to become effective",
    ", we may still expect a reimers - like law to be effective .",
    "however , if pulsation and dust driving enhance mass loss , the agb should be truncated at a lower luminosity .    this process should be metallicity dependent .",
    "metal - poor stars are hotter , typically exhibiting weaker , shorter - period , less effective pulsations .",
    "they also suffer from very low dust - to - gas ratios , meaning dust driving is less effective at accelerating all the ejected material .",
    "we can therefore expect that the agbs of metal - rich clusters would be more curtailed than metal - poor clusters .",
    "dust production in globular clusters typically begins somewhere between 700 l@xmath6 and 1500 l@xmath6 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is becoming clear that the average star starts to develop a dusty wind close to 1000 l@xmath6 .",
    "our mass - loss efficiency can be used to predict the mass of a star reaching this 1000 l@xmath6 point . by comparing this to the final white dwarf mass",
    ", we can determine how much more mass it should lose in a dusty wind .",
    "however , accurate white dwarf masses for globular clusters are difficult to find .",
    "@xcite measured the mass of white dwarfs in m4 ( ngc 6121 ) to be 0.51 @xmath25 0.03 m@xmath6 , a mass later refined by @xcite to 0.53 @xmath25 0.01 m@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite measured masses for white dwarfs in ngc 6752 at 0.53 @xmath25 0.02 m@xmath6 . the initial  final mass function for stars at these masses",
    "is expected to be relatively flat @xcite .",
    "finding the stellar mass at 1000 l@xmath6 becomes a trivial matter of following each stellar evolution model until it reaches 1000 l@xmath6 , interpolating across both the @xmath26 and 0.5 tracks to find a mass appropriate to any particular value of @xmath2 . to find the mass lost in a dusty wind",
    ", we also calculate the envelope mass of an agb star at the luminosity of the rgb tip .",
    "these are presented in figure [ massevolfig ] .",
    "we also estimate the final agb luminosity , avoiding very short extensions to high luminosity during agb thermal pulses .",
    "however , the lack of convergence during the final or second - to - final thermal pulse means that we can only give these approximately .",
    "envelope masses at the final model step are typically @xmath120.01 m@xmath6 , which will be lost in approximately @xmath1230000 years . our computation of the time spent on the dust - producing agb ( above 1000 l@xmath6 ; figure [ agbfig ] ) and the time spent as an agb star with a luminosity greater than that attained on the rgb , will therefore be underestimated by @xmath1230000 years .",
    "stars exceeding the rgb - tip luminosity are easily identifiable as agb stars , as they stand brighter than the rgb tip in infrared colour  magnitude diagrams",
    ".    clusters with metallicities above [ fe / h ] = 1 dex are not shown in figure [ massevolfig ] as interpolation becomes difficult at higher metallicities .",
    "we stress these results are for the stars which have had median zahb mass : more- or less - massive stars will experience more or less dusty mass loss .",
    "results from the mass - loss law of sc05 are not shown , as they have no clear terminus .",
    "figures [ massevolfig ] and [ agbfig ] imply that the median stars in clusters have between 0.01 and 0.15 m@xmath6 to lose as dusty winds , with a typical value being closer to 0.10 m@xmath6 .",
    "metal - poor clusters would produce proportionally more mass in dusty winds , although the presumably lower dust - to - gas ratios of those winds would mean less dust overall .",
    "consequently , stars in metal - poor clusters should reach a higher luminosity on the agb , producing dust for around @xmath121.5 myr and remaining above the rgb tip for @xmath121 myr .",
    "conversely stars in metal - rich clusters should produce dust for @xmath31 myr .",
    "in many metal - rich clusters , there should not be a star above the agb tip for much of the time .",
    "observationally , however , m15 ( the most - metal - poor cluster ) has an agb which terminates at a luminosity below the rgb tip @xcite .",
    "it is likely that a lack of bright agb stars is typical of most or all metal - poor clusters .",
    "agb stars in clusters appear to just reach the rgb tip in @xmath24 cen ( [ fe / h ] @xmath4 1.6 dex ; @xcite ) and noticably exceed the rgb tip in luminosity by ngc 362 ( [ fe / h ] = 1.16 dex ; @xcite ) . in 47 tuc ( [ fe / h ] = 0.72 dex ) , stars spend @xmath12250000 years above the rgb tip , reaching nearly 5000 l@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we therefore have a discrepancy whereby the prediction using reimers law is that metal - rich clusters have no bright , dusty agb stars and metal - poor clusters have bright , dusty agb stars , whereas the opposite is observed .",
    "the problem is compounded when one observes that metal - poor clusters may have a slightly lower @xmath13 than metal - rich clusters , leading to longer - lived stars and a higher - luminosity agb terminus ( see figure [ etafig ] ) . a departure from a reimers-like law to",
    "a pulsation - enhanced , dust - driven wind would exacerbate this , therefore we do not think it likely that pulsation and dust production greatly affect the mass - loss rates of even the brightest globular cluster stars .    adopting the sc05 law",
    "partially alleviates this discrepancy .",
    "the lack of a full treatment of the sc05 law means that the results are marginally less secure , however we can approximately identify the agb terminus under the sc05 law by identifying when a star undergoing mass loss following the sc05 law will have lost its entire envelope . for metal - poor clusters ( [ fe / h ] @xmath27 2 dex ) the agb terminates around 900000 years earlier for the sc05 law ; for metal - rich clusters ( [ fe / h ] @xmath28 1 dex ) it is about 400000 years earlier .",
    "this is not enough to reverse the trend in agb luminosity seen in figure [ agbfig ] .",
    "the variance of @xmath2 among clusters is surprisingly small : the standard deviation among clusters is only 14 per cent .",
    "this is despite their variation by over 20 per cent in initial mass and two orders of magnitude in metallicity , with rgb - tip stars that are up to 1300 k warmer and a third fainter in metal - poor clusters than metal - rich clusters .",
    "that this works so well is a testament to the accuracy of both mass - loss formulisms studied here .",
    "sc05 claim their formula should provide better accuracy than reimers due to the incorporation of physical princples , rather than a simple empirical fit .",
    "we note that both values for @xmath2 come with a 14 per cent standard deviation in this work , thus one would not appear any more accurate than the other",
    ". however , the median internal ( cluster - to - cluster ) error we derive for @xmath2 is also 14 per cent .",
    "this internal error is driven largely by the uncertainty in cluster age for metal - poor clusters , and a combination of age and metallicity for metal - rich clusters .",
    "it is not clear from our data that the sc05 law necessarily provides a much better fit than reimers.    despite the relatively closeness in @xmath2 among clusters , there are still some trends that can be seen in figure [ etafig ] .",
    "firstly , there is a much greater variation in @xmath2 for the metal - intermediate clusters ( 1.7 @xmath27 [ fe / h ] @xmath27 1.1 dex ) . outside of this range",
    ", there appear noticable gradients in the results with @xmath2 declining at the lowest metallicities .",
    "these are reflected in the predicted lifetimes of agb stars in the dusty and super - rgb - tip phases described in section [ agbsect ] , where metal - poor clusters have agb tips higher than typically observed and metal - intermediate clusters have a range of expected agb termini .      to reconcile our reimers @xmath2 calculations with observed agb populations for the metal - poor clusters , one or more adaptations",
    "could be made :    * a mass - loss law with a stronger temperature dependence could be used , possibly invoking a mechanism which more strongly affects hotter hb or early - agb stars ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature dependence would have to be stronger than that of sc05 .",
    "* slower evolution in metal - poor agb stars in the @xmath125002000 l@xmath6 range than predicted , allowing the wind to be lost over a greater amount of time . * the masses of the horizontal branch stars in metal - poor clusters could have been over - estimated by gcb+10 .",
    "figure [ etafig ] shows a noticable upturn in the hb mass near [ fe / h ] = 1.8 dex .",
    "if these stars can be made less massive , not only do the @xmath2 of these stars become similar to that of the other clusters : the agb tip will also decrease in luminosity to the observed value . * the ages of the oldest globular clusters could be made younger .",
    "this would increase the initial mass of stars , increasing @xmath2 to values more consistent with metal - rich clusters and allowing more agb mass loss to take place , truncating the agb at the observed values .",
    "the first two possibilities are relatively unlikely .",
    "hb mass loss would have to increase above predictions by a factor of @xmath124 to prevent super - rgb - tip stars to become visible .",
    "slower evolution would change the luminosity function around the rgb tip in younger environments ( e.g.  dwarf galaxies ) , but there is no noted drop in the number stars per magnitude over the agb tip in these environments .",
    "gcb+10 quote errors of only a few @xmath290.001 m@xmath6 on their hb star masses . in practice",
    ", however , this neglects contributions from the uncertain metallicity of the clusters , and the stellar evolution codes they use to determine hb mass .",
    "the difference in metallicity quoted by gcb+10 and @xcite for metal - poor clusters is @xmath120.03 dex . a 0.1-dex uncertainty in an individual cluster s metallicity changes the hb mass by @xmath120.01 m@xmath6 , and ( @xmath13 @xmath30 @xmath14 ) by @xmath12(0.03 @xmath30 0.01 ) .",
    "while this would remove a significant part of the gradient in the @xmath2 versus [ fe / h ] relation , without a systematic change in many clusters , global [ fe / h ] is not likely to be the underlying cause of the differences .",
    "similarly , the contribution by helium is not expected to be significant ( appendix [ etahesect ] ) .    the absolute choice of metallicity ( @xmath31 ) , however , may be an issue .",
    "gcb+10 use the metal - poor pisa evolutionary models @xcite , which adopt [ @xmath31/@xmath32@xmath6 = 0.023 , compared to the modern value of @xmath31 = 0.0152 @xmath25 @xmath120.0006 ( see appendix [ trackhescalesect ] ) .",
    "this amounts to a @xmath40.083 dex difference in the zero ( solar ) point for metallicity , depending slightly on the helium abundance adopted .",
    "it is not immediately obvious how correction was made by gcb+10 from the solar - scaled pisa models to the @xmath33-enhanced globular clusters .",
    "@xcite provide a method for doing so , but it involves the adoption of a particular [ @xmath33/fe ] , which is not quoted by gcb+10 . given the likely uncertainty in the average [ @xmath33/fe ] adopted ( @xmath120.1 dex ) , one can presume a further @xmath120.06 dex uncertainty in @xmath31 , based on ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their section 2 ) .",
    "the combination of these uncertainties is sufficient to alter the derived horizontal branch masses significantly ( we estimate by up to @xmath120.02 m@xmath6 for the metal - rich clusters ) .",
    "however , this alters the metal - rich end more than the metal - poor end , and increases rather than decreases the gradient with metallicity for both @xmath13 and @xmath14 versus [ fe / h ] .",
    "the choice of evolution model is also significant .",
    "the pisa hb models for @xmath34 , @xmath35 m@xmath6 return a zahb temperature of @xmath1211700 k , whereas a corresponding mesa model at [ fe / h ] = 2.20 dex , @xmath36 m@xmath6 produces 10100 k. this corresponds to a difference of @xmath37 and a difference in zahb mass as recorded by gcb+10 of @xmath120.02 m@xmath6",
    ". this difference should be in the correct sense , in that pisa evolutionary tracks would record higher masses than the mesa models .",
    "a consistent @xmath120.02 m@xmath6 difference across all clusters would serve to increase the average @xmath13 by @xmath40.05 ( approximately the systematic uncertainty we have allotted for differences among evolutionary tracks ) but would also serve to significantly flatten both distributions of @xmath2 versus [ fe / h ] .",
    "it would remove the unobserved bright agb stars in metal - poor clusters .",
    "however , it would also remove more of the bright agb stars in metal - rich clusters , which are observed .    reducing the age of the metal - poor globular clusters to bring their ages in line with mf+09 and d+10",
    "flattens the age distribution of globular clusters , making them much more closely co - eval .",
    "the addition of @xmath120.02 m@xmath6 to the initial mass of metal - poor clusters and its subtraction from the metal - rich clusters flattens the @xmath2 distributions . the subsequent change in @xmath2 by @xmath380.05 at either end is sufficient to remove the bright agb stars from all but the most - metal - poor clusters , while making the bright agb stars from the metal - rich clusters more visible .",
    "a constant age does not entirely solve the agb problem but it does alleviate it , plus removes the unexplained gradient in both @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we suggest that a combination of these uncertainties could be sufficient to remove the gradient seen in @xmath2 , therefore we can not claim any metallicity dependence exists in @xmath2 .",
    "an absence of a metallicity dependence would be in keeping with the magneto - acoustic driving mechanism proposed for these winds .      the noticeable spread in @xmath2 for intermediate - metallicity clusters ( 1.8 @xmath27 [ fe / h ] @xmath27 1.0 dex ) traces to the hb masses derived by gcb+10 .",
    "the substantial spread in these , nearly 0.1 m@xmath6 , is not seen in the initial masses we derive ( figure [ etafig ] ) .",
    "it also shows up as a significant spread in the rgb mass loss calculated by gcb+10 ( their figure 11 ) .    generally speaking , the older clusters seem to have the lower hb masses and higher @xmath2 , but the underlying causes in this spread are unclear .",
    "well known hb pairs ( m3 and m13 , ngc 288 and 362 ) lie on either side of the divide in hb mass at 0.635 m@xmath6 .",
    "clusters on the lower - hb - mass , higher-@xmath2 side average 23 per cent higher in mass but 39 per cent smaller in radius than clusters on the other side @xcite .",
    "higher mass and central concentration are notable characteristics of clusters with multiple populations as they are more easily able to retain their ism @xcite .",
    "they also have significantly larger spreads in hb mass ( gcb+10 ) , providing evidence of their multiple populations .",
    "the median stars in these clusters could be significantly helium - enhanced , in which case our initial mass for the hb stars in these clusters would be over - estimated .",
    "if true , this would reduce the overall values of @xmath2 we derive , but still within the limits of the systematic errors we apply due to the uncertainty in helium abundance ( appendix [ etahesect ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the efficiency of mass loss experience by globular cluster stars and how that mass loss is distributed throughout the stars evolution . based on the zahb masses from gcb+10",
    ", we have assumed that the median star experiences negligible helium enrichment .",
    "we have combined these isochrones with evolutionary models to determine the following principle conclusions :    * metal - rich globular cluster stars lose more mass on the rgb than metal - poor stars , simply due to their slower evolution . * for most giant branch stars in globular clusters , mass loss on the rgb dominates the total mass lost . *",
    "the mass - loss models of reimers and schrder & cuntz show a relatively constant efficiency in converting ( presumably ) magneto - acoustic energy to stellar outflow , independent of metallicity .",
    "the modelled efficiencies are @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the quoted uncertainties denote the random spread among clusters and the overall systematic uncertainty ( including a factor for helium enrichment ) , respectively .",
    "these values are towards the higher end of previous estimates in globular clusters , and may be somewhat higher than generally found in the field . * while a weak gradient with metallicity is possible , whereby metal - poor stars experience less - efficient mass loss , any gradient is likely to be within the systematic uncertainties of the underlying data .",
    "* stars in globular clusters should generally lose @xmath120.10 m@xmath6 in their final agb dusty wind .",
    "some clusters may no longer regularly produce any dusty stars .",
