    "an x - ray burst from a region including the globular cluster terzan 2 was first observed by oso-8 @xcite .",
    "a weak persistent x - ray source was also found by oso-8 , and grindlay @xcite showed that both the position of this source and a revised position of the _ uhuru _ source 4u1722 - 30 @xcite were consistent with that of the cluster .",
    "later grindlay et al .",
    "@xcite using the einstein hri instrument positioned the x - ray burst source inside the core of terzan 2 .",
    "its name then became 1e17243045 .",
    "basically reliable spectral observations ( exosat and ttm ) show that the source has a rather hard power law spectrum ( photon index around 2 ) in the 1 - 20 kev range with an x - ray flux ranging from 3 to @xmath4 .",
    "there is also an indication from einstein data that at higher flux level ( @xmath5 , i.e. in its high state ) , the x - ray spectrum softens and is better described by a bremsstrahlung model with a temperature of @xmath6 kev @xcite .",
    "estimates of the cluster distance range from 5.2 to 7.7 kpc @xcite .",
    "these values are consistent with the one derived from a type i x - ray burst that showed photospheric expansion @xcite . adopting 7 kpc , the 1 - 20",
    "kev low state luminosity of the source lies around @xmath7  indicating that   belongs to the class of low luminosity systems .",
    "as for the timing properties of the persistent x - ray emission of the source , very little is known . however , during an exosat observation performed with the medium energy ( me ) experiment , a qpo at 0.092 @xmath8 hz was found ( pulsed fraction @xmath9 % , full width half maximum of @xmath10 hz ) .",
    "in addition low - frequency noise and the second harmonic were observed @xcite .",
    "note however that the presence of the qpos reported in the _ iau _ circular was not confirmed in a proceedings paper by the same authors @xcite .",
    "besides its x - ray properties ,  is remarkable by the fact that it is a source of persistent , though variable , hard x - ray emission ( @xmath11 kev ) as observed with sigma @xcite .",
    "is in fact the first , and one of the only x - ray bursters ( i.e. weakly magnetized neutron star ) showing such a persistent emission with a spectrum extending up to @xmath12 kev @xcite .",
    "we proposed  as a target for a rossi x - ray timing explorer observation for two main reasons : first we wanted to characterize the rapid variability of the source in order to check whether , as expected ,  is an atoll source .",
    "second we wished to detail the continuum energy spectrum simultaneously from x - rays to hard x - rays .",
    "the main focus of this paper is the study of the rapid variability of the source in the frequency range @xmath13 to a few tens of hz .",
    "the search for high frequency qpos ( above @xmath14 hz ) will appear elsewhere .",
    "similarly the spectral analysis of the combined pca and hexte data is the subject of a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the correlated temporal and spectral analysis using light curves , color - color and hardness - intensity diagrams . in section 3 , we present the results of the rapid variability study , including the detailed modeling of the pds . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss on the possible origins of the fast timing variability of the source , emphasize the similarities between black hole and neutron star systems , and address the issue about the nature of the low frequency qpo observed .",
    "the rxte observation took place between november , 4th and 8th , 1996 for a total exposure time of about 100 kiloseconds .",
    "the good data filtered for elevation greater than 10 degrees ( as recommended ) can be split in two parts ; the first covers from november 4th at 11:54:08 ( ut ) to november 5th at 10:51:44 ( ut ) and the second from november 8th at 00:30:24 ( ut ) to 23:35:44 ( ut ) .",
    "the  consists of 5 nearly identical large area proportional counter units ( pcu 0 to 4 ) corresponding to a total collecting area of @xmath15 @xmath16 @xcite . for safety reasons ,",
    "pcus are switched on and off in the course of an observation ; mostly pcus 3 and 4 .",
    "as all the pcus have different energy responses , the absence of a single one can simulate spectral variations in color - color and hardness - intensity diagrams . therefore to avoid this , in this section we consider only data recorded when the five pcu units are all working ; this corresponds to a net exposure time of @xmath17 kiloseconds ( elevation greater than 10@xmath18 ) .",
    "there is also an x - ray burst in the middle of the observation ; the analysis of which will be reported elsewhere .",
    "data recorded around this burst are not included here ( 3 orbits of good data are not considered in the present analysis ) .",
    "we use the _ standard 2 _ data to build light curves , color - color and hardness - intensity diagrams . for the rapid variability ,",
    "we use the 16 @xmath19s _ science event _ data provided in 64 energy channels covering the entire pca energy range .",
    "significant flux from the source is detected up to @xmath20 kev ( see fig . [ pcasp ] ) .",
    "we have first generated background subtracted light curves for the entire observation taking the latest versions of the background models provided at the rxte guest observer facilities ( gof ) .",
    "the light curves of   in the energy bands 25 , 510 and 1050 kev are shown in fig .",
    "[ pcalc ] for a binning time of 512 seconds .    as can be seen no large temporal variations",
    "were observed during the observation .",
    "however during the first part , its intensity slowly decreased in all three energy bands .",
    "the mean background subtracted count rate is @xmath21   which corresponds to about 40 mcrab in the 2 - 50 kev band .    following hasinger and van der klis @xcite we have generated color - color diagrams using three energy bands : 2 - 5 , 5 - 10 , and 10 - 50 kev . the color - color diagram computed for a binning time of 128 seconds",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the position of the source in the diagram indicates a rather hard spectrum .",
    "the clustering of points in the diagram indicates that the source spectrum did not change significantly during the observation .",
    "[ coco ]    although the source count rate does not differ by more than 10% along the observation , we have computed two hardness - intensity diagrams , again for a binning time of 128 seconds ( see fig [ hardnessint ] ) .",
    "there is a weak correlation between both the soft and hard colours and the count rate .",
    "the source moves erratically within the defined regions .",
    "given the spectral resolution of the pca , these variations are hardly detectable with standard spectral analysis of the continuum spectrum .",
    "from the previous analysis , one can conclude that the source showed little spectral and intensity variations along the entire observation on timescales of hundreds of seconds .",
    "we have made a pca spectrum for a segment of the observation using the latest versions of the calibration matrices available at the gof .",
    "the spectrum of the source is rather hard , and within the calibration uncertainties at low energies ( below 3 kev ) , can be adequately fitted with a power law of index @xmath22 ( @xmath23 on 1 parameter , see fig .",
    "[ pcasp ] ) .",
    "the best fit corresponds to an unabsorbed 1 - 20 kev flux @xmath24   consistent with the flux seen by einstein during a possible high state of the source . however , there are no doubts that the pca spectrum is harder than the thermal bremsstrahlung ( tb ) spectrum that may have been observed with einstein ( in particular the 6 kev tb fit is ruled out ) .",
    "the pca spectrum resembles more the power law spectra previously observed by exosat and ttm in a so - called `` low state '' . a more detailed spectral analysis including better background subtraction ( which may be an important issue for  given its location in the galactic center region ) , and combination of the hexte data is the subject of a separate paper @xcite .",
    "on timescales ranging from milliseconds to seconds , the source displays intense flickering .",
    "this is illustrated in fig [ lcrapide ] where we show a segment of the observation with two binning times of 0.0122 and 0.1 sec .    in order to investigate the rapid variability of the source on such timescales , we made pds in the frequency range @xmath1 hz in different energy bands .",
    "each continuous set of good data ( lasting @xmath0 2000 sec . ) was divided into @xmath25 segments of @xmath26 bins of @xmath27 second duration .",
    "a fast fourier transform algorithm was used to convert each data segment into frequency space .",
    "the final power spectrum of one segment was obtained by taking the ensemble average over all @xmath25 segments .",
    "the power spectra were subsequently normalized to fractional rms densities according to belloni and hasinger @xcite . for white noise substraction",
    "we have used the expected value of 2.0 for poissonian noise . by looking at pds at frequencies above 700 hz ,",
    "the value observed does not differ by more than 0.1% of the nominal value , indicating that deadtime corrections are negligible in our case .",
    "afterwards , all power spectra were rebinned logarithmically in order to increase the statistical weight of individual frequency bins .",
    "typical pds spectra are shown in figure [ pds2 - 5 - 5 - 20 ] for two energy bands : 2 - 5 and 5 - 20 kev .",
    "the shape of the pds at low frequencies suggests that the source displays the so - called high frequency noise or low - state noise @xcite . in this case",
    "the pds can be described by a lorentzian centered on zero frequency , as given in the following formula :    @xmath28    this pds is produced if the noise is made up of a superposition of finite events ( shots ) whose characteristic duration ( @xmath29 ) is related to the half width half maximum ( @xmath30 ) of the lorentzian ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we thus decided to fit the low frequency part of the spectrum with a lorentzian .",
    "the lorentzian provides a good fit to the low frequency part of the spectrum , in particular much better than a broken power law .",
    "the frequency  above which the pds steepens is around @xmath32 hz .",
    "this means that above @xmath33 seconds there are no more time correlated variations in the x - ray light curve of .",
    "it is clear that above @xmath34 hz , the shape of the pds is complex due to the presence of a broad feature around 0.8 hz .",
    "regardless of the shape of this feature , it was apparent that there was an enhancement `` ( shoulder ) '' above 5 - 6 hz in the pds .",
    "as a first approximation , we have attempted to fit this component of the pds with a second lorentzian .",
    "it turns out that it also provides a good fit to the data up to 40 hz as can be seen in figure [ pdsave_2_20 ] ( excluding the region between 0.3 and 4 hz ) .",
    "the results of the fit are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "[ table1 ]    .modeling of the mean power spectrum in various energy bands .",
    "the columns are the energy range ( kev ) , the shot duration ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) inferred from the first , second and third lorentzians used in the fit ( see text ) and the integrated rms given in % in the @xmath37 hz .",
    "the statistical errors are quoted at the 1@xmath38 level . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we would like to point out that other models could fit our data as well .",
    "the lorentzian fit as used in this work accounts for single - side exponential shots .",
    "however , we could have also used models where the shots are symetric ( e.g. exponential rise and decay with the same timescale ) , in which case the pds should have the shape of the square of a lorentzian . in this case , the pds can be approximated at high frequencies by a steep power law of index 4 .",
    "we are not able to distinguish between these two models because they mainly differ at high frequencies .",
    "unfortunately in our data , the high frequency parts of the lorentzians are not well resolved , due to the superposition of these components in the pds .",
    "regardless of the model assumed , it is clear that the timescales inferred for the variability will not differ by a large factor .",
    "we have also tried to fit the pds with a model accounting for a continuous time distribution of exponential shot durations @xmath39 . if @xmath40 between two extreme values ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) then the pds is white below @xmath43 , falls with a -1 slope down @xmath44 and with a -2 slope beyond .",
    "this model can be approximated with the following function @xcite :    @xmath45\\ ] ]    this model was succesfully applied by belloni and hasinger @xcite to the exosat observations of cyg x-1 . exluding the 0.3 - 4.0 hz range",
    ", we fitted the previous model to our data for comparison with the two lorentzian model .",
    "the fit is not as good : the reduced @xmath46 is 2.3 compared to 0.7 ( 80 d.o.f . including a systematic error of 5% ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ belhasi ] , above @xmath47 hz , the fit is systematically above the data points .",
    "furthermore the model does not account very well for the two shoulders observed at 0.1 and above 5 - 6 hz . to conclude ,",
    "if the shot durations follow a continous distribution , this function must be more complex than a simple power law .    in the framework of the two lorentzian model , the residuals ( see fig . [ pdsave_2_20 ] ) can not be described by any simple models ( gaussian , etc .. ) .",
    "in particular the addition of a third zero - centered lorentzian to account for the residuals worsens the fit as it disturbs the parameters of the lorentzian fitting of the low frequency part of the pds . clearly the way the pds continuum is fitted affects the shape and amplitude of the residuals .",
    "however because of its peaked shape , by the following , we will call this feature a qpo . a more complete modeling of the pds , with the help of simulations and shot profile studies will be the subject of a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the main parameters of the broad qpo feature are : its frequency at @xmath48 hz and its total width of @xmath49 hz .",
    "these two parameters are energy independent and stable within the entire observation .",
    "we noticed that in all pds there is systematically a narrow and sharp feature in the residuals around 0.15 hz ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ pdsave_2_20 ] ) . on the other hand we havent",
    "found evidence for the unconfirmed 0.09 hz narrow qpo previously reported from the exosat - me observation @xcite .",
    "the pds made in different energy bands are all consistent in shape with each other .",
    "for instance the values @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constant and independent of the energy as shown in table 1 .",
    "interestingly , the rms of the three components shows a positive correlation with energy as illustrated in fig [ rmswithenergy ] .      in the 2 - 20 kev energy band which maximizes the signal to noise ratio we made a pds",
    "extending up to 400 hz ( i.e the binning time of the light curve is now 1.2 milliseconds ) . above 40 hz , in excess of the two lorentzian fit described above , we found a new component ( see fig .",
    "[ pdsave_2_20 ] later ) .",
    "we again tried to fit this high frequency component with a third lorentzian .",
    "if this model is correct , and if interpreted in the framework of the shot noise model , the fit implies a shot decay time of 1.4 ms .",
    "the rms of this third component is @xmath50% .",
    "as can be seen the inferred shot timescale is very close to the bin time of the light curve .",
    "we have checked through simulations that this component is not an artefact of the binning of light curve .",
    "was observed with rxte in a hard state for which the x - ray spectrum is a hard power law and the pds shows the so - called `` high frequency noise '' .",

    "is a persistent x - ray source as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ xteasm ] where we show its rxte - all sky monitor light curve .",
    "the mean asm count rate corresponds to a flux of @xmath51 mcrab in the 2 - 12 kev range fully consistent with the pca count rate .",
    "this figure suggests that   spends a very large fraction of its time in the `` island '' state with a hard x - ray power law spectrum whose extrapolation in hard x - rays ( @xmath52 kev ) can account for the averaged flux observed by sigma @xcite .",
    "the low variability of the source on long timescales ( days to months ) obviously agrees with the fact that  is also a persistent source of hard x - ray emission , as inferred from sigma observations spanning over 6 years @xcite .",
    "up to 40 hz ( and excluding the 0.3 - 4 hz region ) , we found that the sum of two lorentzians was a possible fit of the pds continuum . in the framework of the shot noise model ,",
    "this first suggests that the light curve of the source is made of a superposition of randomly time distributed shots of two different timescales ( @xmath53 msec and @xmath2 msec ) . obviously",
    ", these two shot durations are too large to be related to dynamical keplerian timescales around the neutron star . comparing the competing timescales in standard sakura - sunyaev accretion disks , miyamoto et al .",
    "@xcite have suggested that shot durations less than 1 second could be related to the time needed for the matter to flow through an x - ray emitting region of the accretion disk where most of the energy is gravitationally released .",
    "this viscous timescale is very sensitive to the disk model used and the value of the viscosity parameter assumed , and might not be appropriate to  for which it is known that standard @xmath54-disk can not account for the observed energy spectra . nevertheless ,",
    "in this picture the x - ray shots would arise from inhomogeneities approaching the inner disk region .",
    "these inhomogeneities whose origin is unknown would then be split into rings of matter which would cause shots of duration equal to the drift time of the matter within the inner disk region .",
    "one prediction of that model is that as the shot progresses and gets closer to the central object , its spectrum should harden , at least in the case of a black hole @xcite .",
    "given the statistical quality of our data , it might be possible to select and superpose the best time resolved and strongest shots and follow their spectral evolution with time .",
    "this model could also be pushed to explain the 1.4 ms shots that we observed . on the other hand , for those shots ,",
    "their duration is also consistent with the keplerian timescales at the inner disk radius , or even at the neutron star surface .",
    "however , explaining the shot duration with either timescales makes difficult to understand the aperiodic nature of the signal .",
    "in addition , the pds contains a broad qpo - like feature centered at 0.8 hz .",
    "low - frequency qpos have been reported so far from at least two x - ray bursters ; 4u1608 - 522 @xcite and the somewhat peculiar cir x-1 @xcite .",
    "4u1608 - 522 was observed by ginga in a low intensity state in three observations during which the source displayed very intense flickering .",
    "the shape of its pds is similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ pdsave_2_20 ] .",
    "yoshida et al .",
    "@xcite modeled somewhat differently the pds using a sum of a broken power law , and up to three lorentzians ; one of which accounting for the low - frequency qpo , another for a high frequency component above @xmath55 hz ( similar to the second shoulder in fig .",
    "[ pdsave_2_20 ] ) .",
    "they also found a correlation between the flat top power level and the break frequency ; the so - called `` belloni - hasinger '' effect discovered from the black hole candidate cyg x-1 @xcite .",
    "in addition as the source intensity increased , the source remaining in a low state , the energy spectrum hardened and the qpo feature as well as the high frequency component moved to higher frequencies ( from 0.4 to 2 hz for the qpo ) . for cir x-1 , the same behaviour is observed and the qpo frequency varies within the orbital cycle from @xmath56 to 12 hz @xcite .",
    "unfortunately for us ,  was observed by rxte in a single spectral / intensity state , and the pds remained very stable in shape throughout all the observation ; so we are unable to test the presence of such a correlation in our data .",
    "atoll sources in their `` island '' states have striking similarities with black hole candidates both in their spectral and timing properties . in this state ,",
    "`` atoll '' sources emit hard x - ray tails , e.g. 4u1608 - 522 @xcite .",
    "the similarities are even more pronounced for the timing properties .",
    "there was already the convincing example of 4u1608 - 522 and cyg x-1 @xcite which both show the same pds shape and high level of rms ( @xmath57% ) in their low x - ray states .",
    "the comparison of our pca data for  with those recorded by osse from gro j0422 + 32 @xcite provides another spectacular example of such similarities ( see fig .",
    "[ grojosse ] ) .",
    "gro j0422 + 32 is an x - ray transient which was in outburst in 1992 @xcite during which the osse hard x - ray ( 35 - 150 kev ) observations were performed .",
    "gro j0422 + 32 is considered as a black hole candidate with a more likely mass for the compact object in the range 2.5 - 5 @xcite .",
    "although taken at higher energies , the pds and the qpo feature seen in  are strikingly similar in shape to the one we observed from . the only difference between the two pds are the shot timescales inferred from the fitting . for gro j0422 + 32",
    "the shot timescales are respectively 50 msec and 2.2 seconds while the broad qpo feature is centered at 0.2 hz .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is about a factor of @xmath58 for @xmath59 , @xmath60 between  and .",
    "low frequency qpos have been observed from several other black hole candidates ; of the most convincing detections we find gx339 - 4 ( 0.77 hz ) @xcite , lmc x-1 ( 0.08 hz ) @xcite , cyg x-1 ( 0.04 hz ) @xcite .",
    "note that for the few cases we have so far , it seems that qpo frequencies from neutron star systems ( @xmath61 hz ) seem on average to be larger than those seen in black hole systems .",
    "it is unlikely though that the qpo frequency is directly correlated to the mass of the compact object ( the larger the mass , the slower the qpos ) , as in this case , we would expect it to be comparable for all neutron star systems , and constant within a given system . as said above , this is not the case neither for 4u1608 - 522 nor for cir x-1 @xcite .",
    "the hfn with a high level of rms on to which a low frequency qpo is superimposed thus emerges as a similarity between black hole and neutron star systems , suggesting that similar mechanisms are involved independently of the nature of the compact object .",
    "the origin of these qpos is still unclear .",
    "it is clear however that they can not be related to keplerian motions as the associated radius ( @xmath62 km ) is much larger than the radius of the region where the x - rays are emitted ( @xmath63 300 km ) . given the short shot durations inferred from our analysis , it appears unlikely that the qpo can result from the direct modulation of the shots .",
    "in addition the large rms , and its positive correlation with energies implies that it originates from the region of main energy release ( i.e close to the compact object ) .",
    "it is rather difficult to find a mechanism which could cause qpos in that region .",
    "depending on the viscosity parameters , disk luminosity oscillations around 1 hz might result from thermal - viscous instabilities developing within the inner parts of the disk around a neutron star @xcite .",
    "these oscillations will exhibit quasi - periodic behaviour if the mass flow entering the inner disk region is not constant .    independently of the mechanism producing the shots vikhlinin et al .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the low frequency qpos could result from a weak interaction between the shots when the instability develops in a region of stable energy supply . to keep the energy released constant on large timescales ,",
    "the appearance of strong shots should affect the amplitude and/or the probability of occurrence of subsequent shots . in our case",
    ", this would mean that on average , one shot is followed about @xmath64 seconds later by a second shot .      beside the two previous models which do not make any assumptions on the nature of the compact object",
    ", there is another one which involves a rapidly rotating weakly magnetized neutron star .",
    "this model has recently been proposed by stella and vietri @xcite .",
    "the latter authors showed that the broad peaks ( around tens of hz ) observed in the pds of several atoll sources ( 4u0614 + 091 , mxb1728 - 34 , and ks1731 - 260 ) , all displaying twin kilo - hz qpos , could be due to the precession of the innermost disk region .",
    "so close to the neutron star , there are two precession frequencies to consider ; one caused by the `` frame dragging '' effect @xcite ( ) , and another one induced by the oblatness of a fastly rotating neutron star @xcite ( ) .",
    "the precession frequency is the sum of the two frequencies , in which  generally dominates over .",
    "both frequencies depend on the neutron star spin frequency ( ) and the keplerian frequency at the inner disk radius ( ) . the latter quantities can be estimated if the observed twin kilo - hz qpos are interpreted with a magnetospheric beat frequency model @xcite . the neutron star parameters ( mass , m=  and moment of inertia , i=@xmath65 ) are two other , and more uncertain parameters which critically determine the range of precession frequencies . for neutron star models with stiff equation of states , /=2 and for @xmath56 @xcite ,",
    "the precession model recovers successfully the frequency of the peaks observed in all three sources ( between 10 and 40 hz ) @xcite .",
    "it is thus tempting to apply this model to our data , although the qpo from  is at a significantly lower frequency .",
    "furthermore , in our case , we do not have yet a value for and .",
    "yet , if one assumes  and , in the framework of the previous model , one can estimate the range of  and  which would match a qpo frequency of 0.8 hz .",

    "however , none of the curves intersects with the region where  and  have been observed for the three sources listed above ( 900 @xmath63 @xmath70 , and 300 @xmath63 @xmath71 hz ) . this might have something to do with the fact that we do nt see any obvious high frequency qpos from this source .",
    "our rxte / pca observation enabled us to classify  as an `` atoll '' source . it was observed in its `` island '' state for which its x - ray energy spectrum is hard and the pds displays high frequency noise with a high level of rms ( @xmath0 30% ) .",
    "the shape of the pds is complex but can be decomposed in the framework of the shot noise model .",

    "<S> we report on the  proportional counter array ( pca ) observation of the x - ray burster  located in the globular cluster terzan 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the observation lasted for about 100 kiloseconds and spanned from november 4th to 8th , 1996 . </S>",
    "<S> the pca source count rate in the 2 - 20 kev range was about 470 cts / s . </S>",
    "<S> no large spectral variations were observed within our observation as inferred from color - color and hardness - intensity diagram analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the persistent x - ray emission shows a high level of noise variability , the so - called high frequency noise ( hfn ) with a fractional root mean squared ( rms ) of @xmath0 25% in the @xmath1 hz range . </S>",
    "<S> the strong hfn together with the hardness of its x - ray spectrum suggest that  is an `` atoll '' source which was in its `` island '' state during the observation . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier power density spectra ( pds ) can be modeled in terms of the sum of two `` shot noise '' components for which the shots have a single - side exponential shape ( i.e. instantaneous rise and exponential decay ) . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic shot decay timescales inferred from the best fitting of the pds are @xmath2 and 16 msec respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the two components contribute similarly to the total rms ( @xmath0 15% ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pds contains also a third component : a broad and asymmetric peaked noise feature centered at 0.8 hz . </S>",
    "<S> this quasi periodic oscillation - like ( qpo ) feature contributes at the level of @xmath0 10% to the total rms . </S>",
    "<S> neither the shot timescales nor the qpo frequency vary with energy . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the integrated rms of all three components shows a positive correlation with energy up to at least 40 kev . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in the 220 kev energy band where the signal to noise ratio is the highest , we found evidence for a high frequency component which shows up in the pds above 100 hz . in terms of the shot noise model , </S>",
    "<S> a lorentzian fit of this last component implies a shot decay timescale of @xmath3 ms .    </S>",
    "<S> we also show that   has striking timing similarities with the black hole candidate gro j0422 + 32 ( nova persei 1992 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our observation demonstrates that a low frequency qpo simultaneously with a high level of rms is not a timing signature unique to black holes . </S>",
    "<S> this extends the growing list of similarities between atoll sources and black hole systems .    </S>"
