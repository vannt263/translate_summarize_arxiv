    "the fact that a noisy channel can be used as a resource for secure communication was recognized by wyner in his seminal work `` the wire - tap channel ''  @xcite where he considered secure communication over degraded broadcast channels  @xcite .",
    "it was generalized by csiszr and krner  @xcite to cover all broadcast channels .",
    "analogously , ahlswede and csiszr  @xcite and maurer  @xcite recognized that dependent source observations available at the terminals can be used as a resource for generating a secret - key ( a uniform random variable shared by alice and bob which is oblivious to eve ) if the terminals can communicate over a noiseless public channel ( which delivers all its input faithfully to all the terminals including the eavesdropper ) . in  @xcite",
    ", the secret - key capacity of dependent sources was characterized if a one - way noiseless public channel from alice to bob and eve of unconstrained capacity is available .",
    "the characterization for the case when there is a constraint on the capacity of the public channel was later found by csiszr and narayan  @xcite as a special case of their results on a class of common randomness generation problems using a helper .",
    "we would also like to note that many authors have contributed to the literature on secret - key generation when a two - way public discussion channel is available ( in the context of both the sources and channels ) which still remains an open problem in general .",
    "however , two - way communication is outside the scope of this short note .    instead",
    ", we focus on scenarios where _ both _ secret communication and secret key agreement are desired in the presence of _ both _ correlated sources and a ( one - way ) noisy broadcast channel .",
    "this paper builds on our earlier work on secret communication and key generation using both sources and channels in  @xcite .",
    "another related recent work is @xcite which independently investigates secret key generation in a similar setting .",
    "we consider the problem where alice wants to send bob a message that needs to be kept perfectly ( information theoretically ) secret from eve , and in addition , alice and bob want to agree on a key that should also be kept perfectly secret from eve .",
    "the only resources available for achieving this are correlated sources at all three parties and a broadcast channel from alice to bob and eve .",
    "note that we do not assume the availability of a public discussion channel .",
    "one motivation for considering this is that in many contexts ( _ e.g. _ sensor networks ) , there is no noiseless public channel directly available , and it is not necessarily optimal to realize a noiseless channel from the noisy channel .",
    "thus , one would like to determine conditions under which noiseless channel realizations would or would not be optimal .",
    "we present a separation strategy which converts alice s noisy broadcast channel into a public and private bit pipe both of which deliver bits input to them faithfully to bob .",
    "moreover , bits sent over the private bit pipe are perfectly secret from eve , but there is no secrecy guarantee on the bits sent over the public bit pipe . with the help of these bit pipes , the sources",
    "are then used to generate additional secrecy .",
    "we show that our separation strategy is optimal for the parallel channels and sources case when each sub - channel and source component satisfies a degradation order ( either in favor of the legitimate receiver or the eavesdropper ) .",
    "our results establish that under certain source and channel conditions , realizing noiseless public and private channels from a noisy broadcast channel is optimal for the communication of both secret key and secret messages .     and",

    "a vector @xmath4 will be denoted by @xmath5 . when @xmath6 , the subscript will be dropped as in @xmath7 .",
    "we make the following assumptions on the channel and sources :    * the channel and the sources are memoryless . * the channel is independent of the sources . *",
    "the number of source observations is the same as the number of channel uses available .",
    "note that we allow all the sources to be observed ahead of time in the sense that the input to the channel may depend on the block of source observations .",
    "the assumption on the number of source observations and channel uses can be easily relaxed and is made here only for reducing the notation . however , the independence assumption is critical to the results we present here .",
