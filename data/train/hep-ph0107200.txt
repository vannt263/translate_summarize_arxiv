    "in recent years the question how to appropriately treat particles in a hot and dense medium has continuously gained growing interest in many areas of physics ranging from plasma physics , condensed matter physics to nuclear and particles physics . within a green s function formalism",
    "a consistent treatment of such phenomena frequently leads to consider dressed propagators , which follow from non - perturbative dyson resummation schemes , rather than perturbative ones , in particular , if damping width effects play a significant role .    already in the early sixties , based on a functional formulation of luttinger and ward @xcite and lee and yang @xcite , kadanoff and baym @xcite considered a class of self - consistent dyson approximations .",
    "baym reformulated this in terms of a variational principle , defining the so called @xmath0-derivable approximations @xcite . since in principle the truncation of",
    "the diagrammatic series of the functional @xmath0 can be at arbitrary level it gives rise to a variety of approximations including hartree and hartree  fock as the simplest schemes .",
    "the main virtue of this concept is that the resulting equations of motion are conserving and the corresponding equilibrium limit is thermodynamically consistent .",
    "this functional treatment constitutes the basis for the two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) diagram technique , where the functional @xmath0 generates the driving terms for the equations of motion , like the self - energy .",
    "later the concept was extended to the relativistic case and formulated within the path integral approach by cornwall , jackiw and tomboulis @xcite .",
    "there is no formal problem to extend the formalism to the schwinger keldysh real - time path method @xcite applicable to the general case of non - equilibrium many - body theory .    despite such early conceptual formulations most applications of self - consistent approximations were pursued on the hartree or hartree - fock level sometimes supplemented by rpa resummations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) or perturbative estimates of higher order corrections .",
    "thus , essentially mean field corrections to the self - energies were considered .",
    "genuine two - point or even multi - point contributions to the self - consistent self - energy , which give rise to a finite damping width , imply a new level of complexity .",
    "various new conceptual problems , like leaving the quasi - particle picture or the issue of renormalization come in with considerable complications for the numerical solutions of such problems . in the pioneering work of bielajew and serot @xcite for the first time the renormalization of self - consistent two - point self - energy loops",
    "were investigated at zero temperature but finite matter density .    in recent years with the special interest in dense hadronic matter problems",
    "the @xmath0-derivable schemes with higher order self - energy terms were used to derive transport equations @xcite from the corresponding kadanoff - baym equations @xcite for the consistent and also conserving @xcite transport treatment of particles with finite spectral width beyond the quasi - particle approximation .",
    "also first investigations involving finite mass width effects on vector mesons were investigated within a self - consistent dyson resummation scheme @xcite . in most of these cases , however , the question of renormalization was circumvented by taking into account the imaginary part of the self - energy only , while the real part was neglected , or cut - off recipes  mostly symmetry violating  were employed , or even the counter terms were chosen temperature dependent ! yet , especially in the study of phase transitions , e.g. , within chiral hadronic models of qcd , or for non - perturbative corrections of hard thermal loop approaches to qcd , e.g. , within a @xmath0-derivable scheme @xcite it is important to consistently take into account both , real and imaginary parts of the self - energies .",
    "therefore in this paper we address the more formal question of renormalizability of such non - perturbative approximations .",
    "we essentially concentrate on the thermodynamic equilibrium case and show how to obtain finite self - consistent dynamical quantities like the in - medium equations of motion and the self - energy of the particles and thermodynamic quantities like the pressure and the entropy . for definiteness and clarity of the presentation",
    "we use the @xmath1-theory as the most simple example to study the related questions .",
    "the results and techniques can easily be transfered to other theories .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sect2 ] we briefly summarize baym s @xmath0-functional using the combined real and imaginary time contour appropriate for thermal equilibrium within the path integral formalism @xcite .    in section [ sect3 ]",
    "we derive the general formalism for the renormalization of the self - consistent self - energy at finite temperature and the in - matter generating functional @xmath2 . with the help of weinberg s convergence theorem @xcite and the bphz - formalism of renormalization theory @xcite",
    "we show that , in close analogy to perturbative renormalization ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) _ any @xmath0-derivable self - consistent approximation scheme can be rendered finite by subtracting pure vacuum counter terms _ given by closed recursive equations .",
    "indeed the main complication arises from the fact that the self - consistent propagator is involved in divergent loops which gives rise to `` hidden '' divergences which have to be resolved .",
    "this leads to a bethe - salpeter equation for the divergent vacuum pieces with a kernel compatible with the functional @xmath0 , which needs to be renormalized .",
    "the renormalized equations of motion for the self - consistent propagator are shown to be consistent with the renormalized 2pi generating functional which proves the consistency of counter terms at both levels .",
    "the diagrammatical interpretation shows that in strict analogy to perturbative renormalization of thermal quantum field theory this procedure can be interpreted as renormalization of the wave functions , the mass and the coupling constants _ in the vacuum_. we also give a closed expression for the renormalized self - consistent thermodynamical potential .",
    "numerical solutions for the renormalized self - consistent dyson equations beyond the standard hartree approximation up to the self - consistent sunset - diagram level could be achieved ; the results are discussed in the second paper of this series @xcite .",
    "in the case of thermal equilibrium the real and imaginary time formalism can be combined by extending the schwinger - keldysh contour @xmath3 , running from @xmath4 to @xmath5 and back to @xmath4 , by appending a vertical part @xmath6 running from @xmath4 to @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "one uses the fact that the factor @xmath8 in the canonical density operator can be formally treated as a time evolution in imaginary time direction .",
    "the functional integral for bosonic fields has to be taken over all fields fulfilling the _ periodic boundary condition _ @xmath9 which leads to the kubo - martin - schwinger ( kms ) condition for the green s functions @xcite . since the equilibrium state is invariant in time one can take @xmath10 and @xmath11 which is convenient when formulating the theory in energy - momentum space via a fourier transformation .",
    "in addition to the usually introduced _",
    "one - point auxiliary external source _ also a _ two - point auxiliary external source _ is included .",
    "variations of the latter generate contour - ordered expectation values of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the extended schwinger - keldysh time contour , and @xmath14 stands for the ordering of the operators due to the ordering of the time arguments along this contour .    the corresponding generating functional is defined within the path integral formalism of quantum field theory as @xmath15=n \\int { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}\\phi \\ ; \\exp \\left[{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{i}}}s[\\phi ] + { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{i}}}{\\int_{\\mathcal{c } } \\text{d}({1 } ) \\ ; { j_1 }        \\phi_1 }   +   \\frac{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{i}}}}{2 } { \\int_{\\mathcal{c } } \\text{d}({12 } ) \\ ; b_{12 } \\phi_1 \\phi_2 } \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is a normalization constant chosen below .",
    "here and in the following the shorthand notation @xmath17 for integrations in @xmath18-dimensional space is used ( in the sense of dimensional regularization ) .",
    "the time integration has to be performed along the time contour introduced above .",
    "it is clear that also the action functional @xmath19 has to be defined as the @xmath20-integral of the lagrangian .",
    "the generating functional @xmath21 for _ connected diagrams _ reads @xmath22=-{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{i}}}\\ln ( n z[j , b]).\\ ] ] the _ mean field _ and the _ connected green s functions _ are defined by @xmath23 the last formula immediately follows from the definition of the partition sum ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) using the feynman - kac formula @xmath24).\\ ] ] since the real - time part of this contour is closed by itself it can be shown that the functional ( [ 1 ] ) factorizes into the real - time part and the imaginary time part .",
    "thus the feynman rules for the calculation of connected green s functions apply separately to the real and the imaginary part of the contour @xcite , since the functional ( [ 3 ] ) splits into a sum of the contributions from the vertical and the real - time part of the contour respectively : @xmath25=z_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}}[j , b ] z_{\\text{th}}[j , b ] , \\ ; w[j , b]=w_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}}[j , b ] + w_{\\text{th}}[j , b]-{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{i}}}\\ln n.\\ ] ]    within the real - time part the effect of the heat bath is completely taken into account by means of the analytical properties of the green s function .",
    "it is uniquely determined by the kms - condition which itself is a consequence of the above mentioned periodic boundary conditions for bosons within the path integral ( see appendix [ appa ] for details about the analytic properties of green s functions and self - energies ) .    by a functional legendre transformation in @xmath26 and @xmath27 one",

    "it is sufficient to subtract the pure vacuum part to render this functional finite , which leads to the well known result . at @xmath33",
    "this subtraction corresponds to the renormalization of the total ground - state energy to zero .    as we shall discuss below in the case of interacting particles",
    "this description is not sufficient to render the effective action and thus the pressure finite , since we need additional subtractions of vacuum sub - divergences to renormalize it .    in the above sense the functional @xmath0 in ( [ 7 ] ) contains the parts of order @xmath34 and higher .",
    "since simple power counting shows the @xmath29-order of diagrams to be identical with the number of loops , @xmath0 as a functional of @xmath27 consists of all closed diagrams with at least @xmath35 loops .",
    "the lines within the diagrams stand for dressed green s functions @xmath27 while the vertices are the bare vertices of the classical action with presence of the background field @xmath26 which can be immediately read off from @xmath36 $ ] around @xmath37 beginning at order @xmath38 .",
    "the equations of motion are now given by the fact that we like to study the theory with vanishing auxiliary sources @xmath39 and @xmath40 . from ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath41 using ( [ 7 ] ) the equations of motion read @xmath42 the first line is of the form of a klein - gordon equation with the quantum corrections to the classical theory on the right hand side .",
    "the second equation is the _ dyson equation _ and shows that the variation of the @xmath0-functional with respect to @xmath27 is the self - energy defined with respect to the classical field dependent propagator ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "this shows that the @xmath0-functional must be _ two - particle irreducible_.",
    "no propagator line must contain a self - energy insertion .",
    "in other words the closed diagrams representing contributions to @xmath0 must not split in disconnected pieces when cutting two lines .",
    "diagrammatically the derivative of a functional with respect to @xmath27 corresponds to opening one line of the diagrams representing it . in that sense",
    "@xmath0 is the generating functional for _ skeleton diagrams for the self - energy _ where the lines represent fully dressed propagators .",
    "thus the functional formalism avoids double counting in a natural way by omitting all non - skeleton diagrams from the dyson - resummed equations of motion . altogether",
    "the @xmath0-functional formalism provides a closed system of exact equations of motion for the full @xmath35-point function and the full mean field .",
    "solving these equations would be equivalent to finding the full propagator of the quantum field theory which of course is impossible in practice .",
    "one obtains approximations by truncating the series for @xmath0 at a certain vertex or loop order ( which corresponds to the respective order in the coupling @xmath43 or @xmath29 respectively ) , while preserving the forms ( [ 8b ] ) and ( [ 8c ] ) of the self - consistent equations of motion .",
    "approximations of this kind respect the conservation laws for the expectation values of noether currents for symmetries which are linearly operating on the field operators ( including space - time symmetries and the according conserved quantities as energy , momentum and angular momentum ) @xcite .    in the case of thermal equilibrium , setting the mean field and the propagator to the solution of the self - consistent equations the effective action gives the grand canonical potential @xmath44_{j , k=0}=-t \\ln z(\\beta)$ ] @xcite .",
    "since the real - time part of the contour in figure [ figure1 ] is closed it vanishes for the solution of the equations of motion .",
    "a short summary about the analytic continuation from the real to the imaginary time formalism is given in appendix [ appa ] .",
    "thus the formalism leads to a well defined treatment for bulk thermodynamical quantities of the system ( like energy , pressure , entropy , etc . ) .",
    "all these quantities can be calculated either with real - time green s functions or with the corresponding imaginary time functions , because as summarized in appendix [ appa ] real and imaginary - time propagators are connected by the analytic properties of the green s functions originating from the kms - condition . for our purpose",
    "the real - time formalism is preferred , because of its simplicity with respect to the analytic structure of green s functions , which easily permits to deal with the mixture of finite temperature and vacuum pieces occurring in the subtraction scheme .",
    "this also avoids the necessity to perform an analytic continuation from imaginary time to real - time green s functions which is complicated to obtain for numerical results .    in order to exemplify the method we apply the formalism to @xmath1-theory with the lagrangian @xmath45",
    "in this section we show that in close analogy to the renormalization of perturbative diagrams also any @xmath0-derivable self - consistent approximation can be renormalized with help of local temperature - independent counter terms .",
    "the proof uses the same line of arguments as in the perturbative case : the reason is , that the renormalization theory completely rests on weinberg s power counting theorem @xcite which is formulated for a general class of green s functions with a given asymptotic behavior .",
    "it does not depend on the special form of the propagators .",
    "the first step is a simple topological argument leading to the superficial degree of divergence for a given diagram @xmath46 , which for the @xmath1 theory simply follows from the number @xmath47 of external lines @xcite @xmath48 due to field reflection symmetry only diagrams with an even number of external lines are different from @xmath49 , the only divergent functions are those represented by diagrams where the number of external legs is @xmath49 ( i.e. , contributions to the total mean energy and the thermodynamical potential ) , @xmath35 ( self - energy ( green s function ) ) and @xmath50 ( four - point vertex functions ) .",
    "the second step is an expansion of the regularized un - renormalized self - consistent self - energy around the self - consistent vacuum propagator which shows that the asymptotic behavior of the diagrams and sub - diagrams is ruled by their pure vacuum parts .",
    "then an equation of motion for the temperature - dependent `` infinite part '' of the regularized self - energy is derived and it is shown that it can be renormalized by a temperature independent subtraction procedure .",
    "we first apply the bphz renormalization theorem @xcite for the vacuum .",
    "the only difference to the perturbative case is that we apply it to diagrams with self - consistent propagator lines .",
    "this is justified since weinberg s power counting theorem is independent of the special form of propagators but only needs their asymptotic behavior stated above .",
    "we summarize the bphz scheme as follows .",
    "a sub - diagram @xmath46 of a diagram @xmath2 is defined as any set of lines and vertices contained in @xmath2 which itself builds a proper vertex diagram : @xmath51 . a sub - diagram @xmath46",
    "is called _ renormalization part _ if its superficial degree of divergence ( or its dimension ) is greater than or equal to @xmath49 . in our case",
    "this means it has at most four external legs .",
    "two sub - diagrams @xmath52 and @xmath53 are called _ nested _ @xmath54 if @xmath52 is a sub - diagram of @xmath53 .",
    "if they have no line or vertex in common , @xmath55 , they are called _",
    "disjoined_. if they are neither nested nor disjoined they are called _ overlapping _ : @xmath56 .    to any diagram @xmath2",
    "we denote the integrand following from the feynman rules with @xmath57 .",
    "for a set of pairwise disjoined sub - diagrams @xmath58 we write the integrand in terms of the integrands of the sub - diagrams @xmath59 and the remainder of the integrand denoted by @xmath60 , usually called the _ reduced diagram _ :",
    "@xmath61 the original scheme by bogoliubov and parasiuk @xcite defines recursively the integrand @xmath62 of the renormalized diagram . if a diagram does not contain any renormalization part but is itself divergent it is called _ primitively _ divergent . in that case",
    "the renormalized integrand is defined by @xmath63 .",
    "herein @xmath64 is the operator of the taylor expansion with respect to the external momenta around @xmath49 up to the order of the dimension @xmath65 of the divergent diagram , which is in our case @xmath66 : @xmath67 if the diagram is convergent the integrand is unchanged under renormalization .",
    "if the diagram is not only primitively divergent but contains divergent sub - diagrams the integrand for the diagram with all subdivergences subtracted is called @xmath68 and the renormalized integrand is defined by @xmath69 from weinberg s power counting theorem it follows that after this recursive procedure the integral over the internal momenta of @xmath62 is finite .",
    "the definition of the _ counter terms _ by the taylor operator @xmath70 for any renormalization part @xmath46 of the diagram shows that these are polynomials in the external momenta to the order @xmath65 and thus can be interpreted as counter terms to the corresponding wave function normalization factors , masses and coupling constants in the original lagrangian .",
    "zimmermann solved bogoliuobov s and parasiuk s recursion with his _ forest _ formula .",
    "a forest is defined as any set of sub - diagrams ( including the empty set and the whole diagram itself ) which are _ pairwise non - overlapping_. one can depict these sets by drawing boxes around the sub - diagrams and in a forest these boxes are not allowed to overlap but they can be nested .",
    "a forest is restricted if each of its boxes contains only renormalization parts . to each restricted forest @xmath71",
    "one associates again an integrand , namely @xmath72 the diagram to the right shows an example case for a typical ladder diagram , which we shall consider in the following section . for this case",
    "@xmath73 for all sub - diagrams and the diagram itself such that for each box only the subdiagram value at vanishing external momenta is to be subtracted .",
    "the tilde over the product sign in ( [ forest - ex ] ) stands for the fact that in case of nested diagrams within the forest one has to apply the taylor operators from the innermost to the outermost diagrams while for disjoined sub - diagrams the expressions are naturally independent of the order of taylor operators , since then @xmath74 the forest formula then says that the integrand of the renormalized diagram is given by the sum over all restricted forests : @xmath75 it is understood that the empty set stands for the diagram itself , i.e. , without any box around a sub - diagram .",
    "the described bphz - scheme chooses the renormalization point for the divergent diagrams at external momenta set to @xmath49 .",
    "it is clear that by another finite renormalization we can switch to any renormalization scheme appropriate for the application considered . in our case of @xmath76-theory",
    "we chose the on - shell scheme .",
    "we have to define the coupling constant , the mass and the wave function normalization .",
    "this can be formulated in terms of the proper self - energy and the proper four - point vertex ( the three - point vertex can be set identical to @xmath49 because of symmetry under field reflection @xmath77 without destroying the renormalizability of the theory , so that we do not have to consider terms linear or cubic in the fields within the lagrangian ) : @xmath78 here @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 are the usual mandelstam variables for two particle scattering , @xmath82 is the external momentum of the self - energy and @xmath83 is the renormalized mass of the particles .",
    "the first condition defines the coupling constant at vanishing momentum transfer for the two - particle scattering to be given by @xmath43 , the second condition chooses @xmath84 to be the physical mass of the particles , while the third condition ensures that the residuum of the propagator at @xmath85 is @xmath86 and thus the on - shell wave function is normalized to @xmath86 as it should be .      in this section",
    "we like to isolate those vacuum subparts inherent in the pure temperature part of the self - energy which need to be renormalized at physical space - time dimension @xmath87 . for this purpose",
    "we assume a regularization scheme , e.g. , dimensional regularization and extract those vacuum parts from the self - energy which diverge in the limit @xmath88 .",
    "for sake of clarification we mark all equations with an asterix which diverge in the limit @xmath88 and which need special renormalization treatment .",
    "all other equations are generally valid , even if all expressions are replaced by their renormalized quantities .    in order to extract the divergent vacuum pieces we take the self - energy as functional of the self - consistent propagator and",
    "expand it around the vacuum value @xmath89 here @xmath90 is the vacuum ( @xmath33 ) self - energy .",
    "its renormalization poses no particular problem and can be done according to standard rules . at the examples discussed in our second paper @xcite",
    "it is shown how to do this in practical cases for the numerical solutions to the self - consistent equations of motion .",
    "the second and third terms in ( [ sig0 ] ) contain the in - matter or finite temperature components of the self - energy .",

    "such loops contain at least one thermal weight factor @xmath97 which decays exponentially at large @xmath98 , since the @xmath99-function parts completely drop out for large loop momenta .",
    "therefore all mixed components like @xmath100 , or @xmath101 have to be excluded from the subtraction scheme .",
    "thus , the expansion point , @xmath102 , in ( [ gt ] ) is defined as the contour - diagonal part of the propagator in the vacuum limit ( @xmath103 ) , i.e. , with vanishing .",

    "thus , there are no hidden subdivergences in @xmath107 , and possible divergent vacuum sub - structures can directly be renormalized using the bphz rules given above .",

    "it is clear that this is a very particular bs - equation , namely the one which complies with the self - consistent dyson resummation scheme defined through ( [ 8c ] ) .",
