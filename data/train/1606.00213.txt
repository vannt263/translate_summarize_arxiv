    "the physical properties of dense and dilute suspensions of biological as well as artificial `` microswimmers '' has attracted significant attention over the last few decades @xcite .",
    "many of the experimental @xcite and theoretical  @xcite studies on biological microswimmer suspensions have focused on the enhanced diffusion of passive ( _ i.e. _ , non - swimming ) tracer particles immersed in bacterial or algal suspensions .",
    "this strongly enhanced tracer diffusion , compared to the expected value from thermal diffusion , has been rationalized in terms of the tracers being advected by the hydrodynamic flow fields of the swimming microorganisms .",
    "as the organisms are self - propelled rather than externally forced ( as long as one neglects the effects of gravity ) , the leading - order flow - field singularity of any self - propelled organism is that of a hydrodynamic dipole ( stresslet ) ( @xcite ) . in the case of biological microswimmers ,",
    "this dipole is usually explained as composed by one propulsive force acting on the fluid , and an equal and opposite force at the other end , coming from the drag imposed by the fluid on the swimmer .",
    "this configuration constitutes an ( extended ) stresslet , composed of two forces @xmath0 separated by some finite distance @xmath1 . depending on the details of the propulsion mechanism ,",
    "the stresslet can have either symmetry : rear - actuated organisms such as  _ e. coli _ and  _ salmonella _ bacteria are usually referred to as `` pushers '' ( extensile ) , while front - actuated microswimmers such as the alga  _ chlamydomonas _ are referred to as `` pullers '' ( contractile ) .    for dilute suspensions , where one can neglect hydrodynamic interactions between swimmers , the experimentally observed @xcite linear dependence on the tracer diffusion constant on the microswimmer density",
    "has been explained theoretically @xcite and numerically @xcite through a pairwise summation of the far - field stresslet contributions from all swimmers .",
    "the flow field from a single point stresslet swimmer ( corresponding to @xmath2 ) at the origin is described by @xmath3 with @xmath4 the orientation ( unit ) vector of the swimmer , @xmath5 the stresslet strength ( with @xmath6 and @xmath7 corresponding to pusher and puller swimmers , respectively ) , and @xmath8 the dynamic viscosity of the fluid .    in practice ,",
    "when numerically simulating bulk suspensions and fluids , it is usually necessary to use periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) in order to emulate an infinite system .",
    "while obviating the need of solid confinement , the introduction of pbcs instead imposes an artificial periodicity on the system .",
    "this periodicity is especially important due to the slow @xmath9 decay of the flow - field of eq .  ,",
    "identical to that of the electrostatic potential outside an electric dipole . for electrostatic systems ,",
    "the artificial periodicity introduced by the use of pbcs has been shown to lead to spurious shifts of the thermodynamic and structural properties of both coulombic @xcite and dipolar @xcite fluids .",
    "the slow decay of the stresslet flow field furthermore requires elaborate methods in order to analyze the resulting periodic sums , inspired by the original ewald summation technique for charged systems  @xcite . in this manuscript",
    ", we will make a careful theoretical analysis of the effect of periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) on the advection of tracer particles caused by the flow field of microswimmers .",
    "( color online ) sketch of the flow field around ( a ) a force - free extended pusher swimmer , the so - called `` di - stokeslet '' , and ( b ) the corresponding pusher point stresslet .",
    "the black dot indicates the center of the particle , the two open circles the positions where the force @xmath10 and counter force @xmath11 are applied to the fluid ( red arrows ) .",
    "@xmath1 denotes the dipole length , the green arrow shows the orientation @xmath12 of both swimmers , and the blue arrows give an impression of the stream lines around the swimmer . for the stresslet ,",
    "the stream lines originate and terminate in the origin and are straight .",
    "the transition from outward to inward flow happens at a fixed angle ( @xmath13 ) , as indicated by the blue dotted lines . ]    to this end , we will first formulate the bulk expressions for the hydrodynamic stokeslet and stresslet . using these expressions ,",
    "we consider the effect of tracer - swimmer separation and the difference between the extended `` di - stokeslet '' and point stresslet descriptions of a microswimmer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : distokes ] ) in an infinite ( non - periodic ) system .",
    "here , we confirm that for small swimmer - tracer separations the tracers are entrained by the swimmer , leading to deviations from the standard concave triangular trajectories followed by tracers advected in dipolar flow fields  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in this regime , we find that the difference between the stresslet and di - stokeslet descriptions becomes appreciable .",
    "we next extend the ewald - summation method for stokeslets put forward by beenakker  @xcite and detailed in pozrikidis  @xcite to properly include the effect of pbcs .",
    "we show that these significantly impact the trajectories of the tracers , even for small swimmer - tracer separation and relatively large boxes .",
    "finally , we investigate the limit of large simulation boxes and find that unpractically large sizes  from the perspective of simulations  are needed for convergence to the bulk system behavior .",
    "our work therefore raises questions concerning the suitablility of common fluid - dynamic solvers to study the bulk behavior of microswimmers .",
    "the starting point for our discussion will be the well - known expression for the stokeslet @xmath14 ( derived in appendix  [ sec : bulkstok ] for completeness ) , which gives the fluid velocity @xmath15 at a point @xmath16 due to a point force @xmath17 applied to the fluid at the origin : @xmath18 with @xmath8 is the dynamic viscosity , and @xmath19 with @xmath20 the biharmonic fundamental solution .",
    "see appendix  [ sec : useful ] for a complete list of our notations and symbol definitions .    to obtain the di - stokeslet we now consider two point forces @xmath0 of equal magnitude and opposite directions , separated by a distance @xmath1 ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : distokes]a . without any loss of generality we place the origin between the two forces , so that they are placed at @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with @xmath23 .",
    "this construction ensures that the system is force free , a prerequisite for self - propulsion .",
    "summing up the two stokeslets , the velocity field at a point @xmath16 in the fluid is thus given by @xmath24 \\boldsymbol{\\hat{p}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now obtain the corresponding expression for the ( point ) stresslet by taking the limit @xmath2 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : distokes]b . by first multiplying with @xmath25 and defining the ( constant ) dipole strength @xmath26 we now recognize the ( negative of ) the directional derivative in the limit of @xmath2 : @xmath27.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using eq .",
    "we can thus write for the stresslet velocity field : @xmath28 \\boldsymbol{\\hat{p}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the expression for @xmath29 \\boldsymbol{\\hat{p}}$ ] can be derived using the standard tensor index notation , where we apply the einstein summation convention over repeated indices : @xmath30 \\boldsymbol{\\hat{p } } = p_{i } \\partial_{i } s_{jk } p_{k } & = \\\\",
    "\\nonumber p_{i } \\partial_{i } \\left ( \\frac{1}{r } \\delta_{jk } + \\frac{1}{r^{3 } } x_{j } x_{k } \\right ) p_{k } & = \\\\ \\nonumber p_{i } \\bigg ( -\\frac{1}{r^{2 } } \\frac{x_{i}}{r } p_{j } - \\frac{3}{r^{4 } } \\frac{x_{i}}{r } x_{j } x_{k } p_{k } + & \\\\ \\nonumber   \\frac{1}{r^{3 } } \\delta_{ij } x_{k } p_{k } + \\frac{1}{r^{3 } }   x_{j } \\delta_{ik } p_{k } \\bigg ) & = \\\\ \\nonumber \\frac{1}{r^{2 } } \\big ( -(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{p } } \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\hat{r } } ) \\boldsymbol{\\hat{p } } - 3(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{p } } \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\hat{r } } ) ^{2 } \\boldsymbol{\\hat{r } } + ( \\boldsymbol{\\hat{p } } \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\hat{r } } ) \\boldsymbol{\\hat{p } } + ( \\boldsymbol{\\hat{p } } \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\hat{p } } ) \\boldsymbol{\\hat{r } } \\big ) & = \\\\",
    "\\label{eq : pdsp3 } \\frac{1}{r^{2 } } \\left ( 1 - 3(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{p } } \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\hat{r } } ) ^{2 } \\right ) \\boldsymbol{\\hat{r } } , & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the kronecker delta and we write @xmath32 .",
    "thus , we obtain the well - known expression for the velocity field induced by a point stresslet : @xmath33 in our construction , positive values of @xmath5 correspond to pusher ( extensile ) swimmers and negative values to puller ( contractile ) swimmers   in eq .  .",
    "before we continue with the derivation of the stokeslet and stresslet in a system with pbcs , we will investigate the difference between the ( extended ) di - stokeslet and ( point ) stresslet descriptions in the near - field of an infinite ( non - periodic ) system .",
    "to this end , we follow the strategy of pushkin and yeomans  @xcite and perform a numerical calculation of the effect of a swimmer passing by a tracer particle , with the swimmer moving from @xmath34 to @xmath35 along the @xmath36-axis with constant velocity @xmath37 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : bulk_geom ] .",
    "over the course of its trajectory , the swimmer interacts with a tracer initially positioned at @xmath38 .",
    "note that , by symmetry , the tracer motion is restricted to the @xmath39 plane .",
    "the tracer trajectory is parametrized by @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and is simply given by the advection it experiences due to the swimmer flow field .",
    "these assumptions result in the differential equations @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the tracer and swimmer positions , respectively .",
    "the fluid velocity @xmath15 is given either by the stresslet expression of eq .  , or its di - stokeslet equivalent , eq .  .",
    "in the numerics , the swimmer trajectories start at @xmath45 and end at @xmath46 , using a varying time - step size to ensure an accurate integration when the separation between the swimmer and tracer is small .",
    "we further assume @xmath47 in our dimension - free units , and the swim - speed is kept constant at @xmath48 .",
    "we set @xmath49 in the stresslet model and @xmath50 in the di - stokeslet model unless otherwise specified .",
    "finally , we denote the final position of the tracer by @xmath51 .",
    "( color online ) two - dimensional ( 2d ) representation of the bulk geometry .",
    "the trajectory of the swimmer ( green circle ) is along the @xmath36-axis from @xmath34 to @xmath52 , which the swimmer traverses with speed @xmath37 .",
    "the tracer ( blue circle ) is advected along the red trajectory  here we have assumed a puller type swimmer .",
    "the initial position of the tracer ( black circle ) is given by @xmath53 .",
    "the tracer displacement due to advection by the swimmer flow field is measured using @xmath54 and @xmath55 which are measured with respect to @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the final tracer position , as assumed once the swimmer has completed its trajectory , is given by @xmath58 and @xmath59 , see the inset . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : small](a , b ) shows the difference between the di - stokeslet and stresslet descriptions on the advection of tracer particles . for @xmath60",
    "the deviation between the trajectories is minimal .",
    "however , for smaller values of the initial separation there is a clear `` rounding '' of the di - stokeslet result with respect to that of the stresslet , which is a manifestation of the finite separation between the two force points .",
    "clearly , the effect of the swimmer on the tracer becomes more pronounced as their separation is reduced . below a certain value of the separation ( @xmath61 for our parameters )",
    "the tracer will start interacting with the `` naked '' singularity at the center of the swimmer  or the front singularity in the di - stokeslet approximation  leading to divergences in the tracer trajectory .",
    "these clearly require regularization , and could be prevented using additional swimmer - tracer interactions accounting for near - field lubrication effects and non - hydrodynamic interaction potentials .",
    "it is also clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : small](a , b ) that the trajectory due to the stresslet swimmer becomes increasingly asymmetric with decreasing @xmath56 .",
    "this can be explained by the tracer being `` entrained '' in the near - field flow of the swimmer  @xcite .",
    "this entrainment leads to the trajectories not being closed , leading to finite values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 after the full trajectory .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : small]c , where the difference @xmath62 between the initial and final position of the tracer is given as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "as has been pointed out by pushkin and yeomans  @xcite , this difference will approach zero in the limit where the tracer advection is negligible compared to the swimmer movement ,  _ i.e. _ , @xmath63 , which corresponds to the limit @xmath64 .",
    "however , for the short swimmer - tracer separations studied in fig .",
    "[ fig : small ] , this displacement is significantly different from zero",
    ". furthermore , we note that the differences between the stresslet and di - stokeslet descriptions are surprisingly small , even though the near - field flows of these two objects differ substantially .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that the di - stokeslet results reduces to those of the point stresslet in the limit @xmath2 , as expected .",
    "figure  [ fig : small]d shows this effect for @xmath65 and various values of @xmath1 in the case of a pusher swimmer .",
    "for this small swimmer - tracer separation , a value of @xmath66 has to be chosen for reasonable convergence to the stresslet result .",
    "summarizing , the di - stokeslet and stresslet models are essentially equivalent for swimmer - tracer separations where entrainment is not important .",
    "however , in the regime where the effect of near - field tracer entrainment becomes appreciable , both types of swimmer lead to strongly ( and differently ) asymmetric trajectories .",
    "suppose that we have a periodic system with a unit - cell whose vectors are @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , such that the volume of the cell is @xmath70 .",
    "in the periodic system there is an infinite number of force points , located at positions @xmath71 , with @xmath72 . for a given point @xmath73 in the central box , the position vector corresponding to the @xmath74-th force point is thus given by @xmath75 .",
    "one would then assume that the velocity experienced at @xmath73 due to the array of point forces is given by @xmath76 however , the slow @xmath77 decay of @xmath78 leads to the sum in eq .",
    "being conditionally convergent , just as when summing up electrostatic charge and dipole potentials .",
    "thus , the flow field will depend on the order in which the terms are summed . from a physical perspective , however , one usually selects a summation over spherical ( or , in the case of a non - cubic box , spheroidal ) shells . from a computational viewpoint , the slow convergence of eq .   furthermore makes it necessary to employ more elaborate methods , inspired by the ewald summation used in electrostatics , to transform the sum into a more rapidly ( and absolutely ) convergent one .      in this paper",
    ", we will follow the method put forward by pozrikidis  @xcite , who suggested a splitting of the stokeslet according to @xmath79 with @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the error function , @xmath82 its complement , and @xmath83 is a splitting parameter .",
    "@xmath84 now yields a rapidly convergent sum in real space ( dominant for @xmath85 ) , whereas the long - range part @xmath86 ( dominant for @xmath87 ) will be handled in fourier space , where it will also become absolutely convergent .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ sec : pbcstokewald ] and ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain @xmath88 and @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the reciprocal - space wave vector and @xmath91 with @xmath92 . the sum in eq .",
    "is now given by the two absolutely convergent sums @xmath93 where it is assumed that the left - hand side sum is carried out over spherical shells .",
    "note also that the @xmath94 term should be excluded from the right - hand side as discussed in section  [ sub : fourspace ] .      the velocity field due to a stresslet in pbcs can now be derived in the same manner as in section  [ sec : bulk ] : @xmath95   \\boldsymbol{\\hat{p } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we consider the real - space and fourier - space parts separately to write down the expression for this velocity , beginning with the real - space part : @xmath96 & = \\\\ \\label{eq : stresscalc } \\frac{1}{r^{2 } } \\big [ d(\\xi r ) \\boldsymbol{\\hat{r } } - e(\\xi r ) ( \\boldsymbol{\\hat{r } } \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\hat{p}})^{2 } \\boldsymbol{\\hat{r } } - f(\\xi r ) ( \\boldsymbol{\\hat{r } } \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\hat{p } } ) \\boldsymbol{\\hat{p } }   \\big ] & , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the argument of the function , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are given by eqs .   and  , and we have defined the new auxiliary functions @xmath99    the fourier - space part is obtained by taking the directional derivative ( with respect to @xmath73 ) of eq .   to yield @xmath100    summarizing , we may write for the velocity field due to a periodic array of stresslets with dipole strength @xmath5 and direction @xmath12 @xmath101 with @xmath102,\\ ] ] and @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are given by eqs .  ,  ,  and  .",
    "it can also be straightforwardly seen that the expression in eq .   reduces to the direct sum of eq .   in the limit @xmath107 .",
    "we finally note that these expressions are different from those derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , as those results correspond to a periodic array of singularities that exclude the source term ( the second term inside the bracket of eq .  ) .",
    "we now turn our attention to the effect of periodic boundary conditions on the interaction between swimmers and tracers .",
    "the geometry in which we perform our calculation is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbcs]a .",
    "our simulation box is cubic with edge length @xmath108 , centered on the origin .",
    "the general numerical procedure is thus the same as that described in section  [ sec : approx ] , apart from that the swimmer now moves from @xmath109 to @xmath110 along the @xmath36-axis . when integrating eqs .  and",
    ", the fluid flow velocity @xmath15 is now given by the pbc stresslet expression of eq .  .",
    "we furthermore used the value @xmath111 suggested by beenakker  @xcite for cubic boxes , and ( cubic ) real- and fourier - space cutoffs of @xmath112 , @xmath113 , which gave convergence to within the numerical rounding error with respect to a cutoff of @xmath114 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pbcs]b , shows tracer trajectories induced by a periodic array of pusher swimmers with identical properties to those discussed in section  [ sec : approx ] , for several values of @xmath56 in a box of length @xmath115 .",
    "we start by noticing that our ewald expressions are in accordance with results of an explicit summation of stresslets in spherical shells ( dashed lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : pbcs]b ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that these sums are extremely slowly convergent , and that even for 40 layers of images ( corresponding to @xmath116 85 minutes of cpu time ) , the curves are not fully converged to the ewald results , where the latter require only @xmath117 seconds of cpu time .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that even for relatively small swimmer - tracer separations ( @xmath118 ) , the observed trajectories are significantly perturbed by the use of pbcs .",
    "while for long separations ( @xmath119 ) , the trajectories are qualitatively wrong compared to the bulk results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pbcs]c ) , they are still underestimating the maximum values of @xmath55 by about 25 % even for the shortest swimmer - tracer separations considered .",
    "while the overall pbc trajectories are still approximately closed ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath120 when @xmath121 ) , the observed discrepancy would have a large effect on tracer displacements for reorienting ( `` tumbling '' ) swimmers , where tracer trajectories are not closed  @xcite . as a different manifestation of this effect",
    ", we finally consider the convergence towards the bulk behavior when increasing the box size while keeping @xmath122 constant at a value of 10 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pbcs]d ) .",
    "we note that , to obtain a reasonable correspondence with the bulk curve ( @xmath123 error ) , a box length of @xmath124 is needed , corresponding to @xmath125 .",
    "this is a rather surprising and potentially worrying result , as this is far beyond the system sizes accessible in typical computer simulations .",
    "it is furthermore a much more long - ranged effect than what is observed in corresponding simulations of electric dipoles under pbcs , where the periodicity artifacts usually become negligible at length scales @xmath126  @xcite .",
    "the results shown here strongly highlight the effect of using periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) in hydrodynamic simulations ( such as stokesian dynamics @xcite , disspative particle dynamics  @xcite , and lattice boltzmann simulations  @xcite ) of microswimmers . specifically , they show that even for relatively small swimmer - tracer separations , the effect of using pbcs rather than bulk solvent can be dramatic .",
    "tracer advection at these swimmer - tracer separations are expected to contribute strongly to measureable properties such as the mean - square tracer displacement , which one should therefore expect to be significantly underestimated by the use of pbcs . on the other hand ,",
    "our results show that the difference between using extended ( `` di - stokeslet '' ) or point stresslet dipoles does not give an appreciable effect for other than very small swimmer - tracer separations , where higher order singularities , lubrication effects , and non - hydrodynamic interactions are likely to dominate . in a broader context",
    ", this work highlights the importance of the boundaries when studying systems with long - range fluid flows such as microswimmer suspensions .",
    "therefore , studying the effect of other geometries , such as confinement with solid walls , that are realistic from an experimental point - of - view would be of large relevance to the field of biofluids .",

    "the fundamental solutions are specified by @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the three - dimensional ( 3d ) delta distribution , and are given by @xmath140 with @xmath141 the radial distance with respect to the origin .",
    "the fourier space equivalent of eqs .   and   are given by @xmath142 with @xmath90 the wave vector , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 here , we have used the definition of the fourier transform @xmath145 with @xmath146 the imaginary unit and the associated inverse fourier transform @xmath147 using properties of the fundamental solutions , as well as the fourier transform , we obtain the following equalities for the harmonic fundamental solution @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 are radial unit vectors in real and fourier space , respectively , and @xmath151 denotes the identity matrix . similarly , we obtain for the biharmonic fundamental solution @xmath152    finally , it will be useful to examine the following properties of the error function @xmath81 : @xmath153 with @xmath154 the incomplete gamma function .",
    "the error function s complement is given by @xmath155 .",
    "for the derivative of the complementary error function we have that @xmath156 with @xmath157 the derivative with respect to @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , we have the following identities @xmath158 with @xmath83 a real number .",
    "let us now turn to the stokeslet , the fundamental solution to the stokes equation in bulk . here ,",

    "the second line gives the incompressibility condition , which closes the equation . without loss of generality",
    "we take the force @xmath17 to be located at the origin , so that @xmath16 is the point in the fluid where we want to determine the velocity .    to determine the solution to eqs .   and",

    "in this section , we use ewald sums to deal with the slow convergence of the sum in eq .   and discuss the interpretation of the stokeslet object in a system with pbcs .",
    "we follow the strategy by beenakker  @xcite and pozrikidis  @xcite closely .",
    "we start by writing @xmath174 with @xmath175 where @xmath83 is a splitting parameter , @xmath81 is the error function , and @xmath176 its complement . as will be shown below , the functions @xmath177 and @xmath178 will contain the ( short - range ) real- and ( long - range ) fourier - space parts of the velocity field , respectively .      using properties of the @xmath179 function and biharmonic green s function @xmath180 as provided in appendix  [ sec : useful ] , it can be straightforwardly shown that @xmath181 \\\\ \\label{eq : stokesletreal2 }   & = \\frac{1}{r}\\left ( c(\\xi r)\\underline{\\mathbb{i } } + d(\\xi r)\\boldsymbol{\\hat{r } } \\otimes \\boldsymbol{\\hat{r } } \\right ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the functions @xmath182 it should be noted that @xmath177 decays exponentially , which means that the real - space part of the velocity @xmath183 is given by a convergent sum .",
    "our starting point will be poisson s summation formula : @xmath184 where @xmath137 is a function and @xmath185 is its fourier transform , as in eq .  .",
    "essentially , poisson s formula states that the lattice sum of a function in real space is related to the sum of the fourier transform of that function over reciprocal space .",
    "the reciprocal lattice vectors are furthermore given by @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 ; such that @xmath189 for @xmath190 .",
    "we now use   to deal with the summation of the long - range part @xmath178 of the stokeslet : @xmath191 note that here we must sum over @xmath192 rather than @xmath193 to use poisson s formula .",
    "however , since this only constitutes a shift , the second equality holds provided we take the fourier transform of @xmath178 in the point @xmath192  technically , one instead takes the fourier transform of the new function @xmath194 . this shift and transform",
    "can now be written using the definition in eqs .   and   as follows @xmath195 where @xmath196 .    to ease the computation",

    "inserting @xmath197 into the exponent and recognizing that one can shift the integration parameter to @xmath198 without modifying the integral ( due to it being over @xmath199 ) , the above can be rewritten to @xmath200 if we now examine only the integral on the right - hand side and go to spherical polar coordinates for @xmath201 with the @xmath36-axis aligned with @xmath90 , _",

    "in the left - hand - side of eq .  , we recognize the first term as the complex component of the fourier transform of the heaviside step function ( @xmath207 ) . the second term can be dealt with using complex contour integration .    now recombining the terms in eqs .  ,  , and",
    "we may write @xmath208 \\\\ \\label{eq : psifour } & = \\frac{8\\pi}{k^{2 } } \\left ( \\underline{\\mathbb{i } } - \\boldsymbol{\\hat{k } } \\otimes \\boldsymbol{\\hat{k } } \\right ) \\left ( 1 + \\frac{\\omega^{2}}{4 } + \\frac{\\omega^{4}}{8 } \\right ) e^{-\\omega^{2}/4 } e^{-i \\boldsymbol{k } \\cdot \\boldsymbol{r}_{\\boldsymbol{0 } } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced @xmath91 .",
    "it should be noted that the term @xmath94 leads to a divergence .",
    "this divergence can be physically interpreted as there being no solution for the velocity field in pbcs when only a point force is applied .",
    "that is , an infinite total force is applied to the ( total ) solvent , which is unphysical .",
    "the solution to this problem is to remove the @xmath94 term from the fourier sum , so that there is no net force applied to the system .",
    "physically , this should be interpreted as a homogeneous counter - force density applied in the direction opposite to @xmath17 .    using the expression for @xmath209 we can now write down the fourier - space part of the velocity @xmath210 .",
