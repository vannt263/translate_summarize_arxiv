    "fig : maximamaplight ] for a multi - strain model with less infectivity for secondary infection as for the first just by adding temporary cross - immunity to previously existing dengue models .",
    "either researchers previously focussed in their models on higher infectivity for secondary infection as for the first due to the hypothesized effect of antibody - dependent - enhancement ( ade ) , wich is confirmed in tissue experiments @xcite , to increase viral load on a secondary infection with a different strain than obtained in the first infection @xcite .",
    "or they focussed on temporary cross - immunity versus ade but again limiting the effect of ade to increase the contribution of secondary cases to the force of infection @xcite .",
    "deterministically chaotic attractor obtained from a two - strain model with temporary cross - immunity in the ",
    "inverse ade  parameter region of contribution of secondary infection to the overall force of infection . a further description of this graphics will be given in the next sections .",
    "our model is a basic two - strain sir - type model for the host population only slightly refined as opposed to previously suggested models for dengue fever .",
    "it is capturing the effective dynamics of the human host population for the dengue virus , keeping effects of the mosquitoe dynamics ( dengue is transmitted by mosquitoes acting as transmission vectors for the virus ) or seasonality only in account by the effective parameters in the sir - type model , but not modelling these mechanisms explicitly .",
    "instead we focus on the multi - strain aspect and its effects on the host population .",
    "this basic model structure allows to generalize our findings to other multi - strain epidemiological systems , but is motivated by modelling dengue fever epidemiology with its peculiar phenomenology .",
    "dengue is a mosquito - borne infection which in recent years has become a major international public health concern .",
    "two fifths of the world s population is at risk from dengue .",
    "the world health organization ( who ) estimates there may be 50 million cases of dengue infection worldwide every year .",
    "the disease is now endemic in over 100 countries throughout the americas , south - east asia , the western pacific islands , africa and the eastern mediterranean @xcite .",
    "dengue fever is transmitted by the female domestic mosquito _",
    "aedes aegypti _ , although _ ae . albopictus _ and",
    "_ ae . polynesiensis _ can also act as vector @xcite .",
    "virus transmission in its simplest form involves the ingestion of viremic blood by mosquitoes and passage to a second susceptible human host .",
    "the mosquito becomes infected when taking a blood meal from a viraemic person . after an extrinsic incubation period ,",
    "the mosquito becomes infective and remains so during its entire life span @xcite .",
    "as the blood meal stimulates ovoposition , which undergoes at least one , often more , reproductive cycles there is an opportunity of vertical transmission to the eggs , passing the virus to the next generation of mosquitoes @xcite . in a dry state , eggs survive for very long periods and the virus can persist until the subsequent rainy season @xcite .",
    "dengue is caused by four antigenically distinct single - strand positive - polarity rna viruses , designated dengue types @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , and belonging to the family flaviviridae @xcite .",
    "infection by one serotype confers life - long immunity to only that serotype and temporary cross - immunity to other serotypes exists .",
    "it lasts from three to nine months , when the antibody levels created during the response to that infection would be enough to protect against infection by a different but related serotype @xcite .",
    "two forms of the disease exist : dengue fever ( df ) or classic dengue , often benign , and dengue hemorrhagic fever ( dhf ) , which may evolve towards a severe form known as dengue shock syndrome ( dss ) @xcite . without proper treatment dhf case fatality rates can exceed 20@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "df is characterized by headache , retro - orbital pain , myalgia , arthralgia , rash , leukopenia , and mild thrombocytopenia .",
    "the symptoms resolve after 27 days .",
    "dhf is a potentially deadly complication that is characterized by high fever and haemorrhagic phenomenae .",
    "dhf develops rapidly , usually over a period of hours , and resolves within 12 days in patients who receive appropriate fluid resuscitation .",
    "otherwise , it can quickly progress to shock @xcite .",
    "there are indeed pre - existing antibodies to previous dengue virus that can not neutralize but rather enhance infection in vitro , a process described as antibody - dependent enhancement .",
    "epidemiological studies support the association of dhf and dss with secondary dengue infection .",
    "halstead @xcite found that dhf and dss were 15 - 80 times more likely in secondary then in primary infections and were positively associated with pre - existing dengue - virus - specific antibodies .",
    "however , there is no animal model of dhf and dss , and the the causal relationship between ade and severe disease remains unverified @xcite .",
    "there is no specific treatment for dengue .",
    "a vaccine against dengue is not yet available , since it would have to simulate a protective immune response to all four serotypes @xcite .",
    "mathematical models describing the transmission of dengue viruses appeared in the literature as early as 1970 @xcite .",
    "more recently modelling attention has focussed on including ade as due to higher viral load of hosts on secondary infection than on the first , hence a higher contribution to the force of infection of each strain , reporting deterministically chaotic attractors @xcite and chaos de - synchronization @xcite to explain the co - existence of the known four dengue viral strains .",
    "temporary cross - immunity against all strains after a first infection has been included in mathematical models as well @xcite , but to our knowledge , no systematic investigation of the attractor structures of simple two - strain models with dengue - realistic temporary cross - immunity and decreased contribution of secondary infection to the force of infection , due to severity of infection with a second strain and eventual hospitalization , has been performed so far .",
    "our finding of chaotic attractors in this parameter region thus indicate that deterministic chaos is wider present than previously expected in multi - strain models . for such scenarios new tools of non - linear data analysis like",
    "takens embedding are available @xcite , and allow to obtain topological information ( fixed points , periodic orbits and the nature of chaotic attractors ) about the whole multi - strain epidemiological system from time series of overall infecteds only , not needing any single strain data sets .    in the next section we present the two - strain model and give the deteministic mean field version of it .",
    "we then analyze the deterministic ode - model in various parameter regions in its attractor structure .",
    "multi - strain dynamics are modelled with sir - type models , dividing the host population into susceptible , infected and recovered individuals .    in the simple sir epidemics without strain structure of the pathogens we have the following reaction scheme for the possible transitions from one to another state @xmath5 for a host population of @xmath6 individuals , with contact and infection rate @xmath7 , recovery rate @xmath8 and temporary immunity rate @xmath9 .",
    "demography is denoted in the last reaction as exits from all classes @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 with rate @xmath13 to the new born susceptibles .    to include population noise stochastic models are investigated . for state vectors @xmath14 , here for the sir - model @xmath15 , the master equation @xcite reads @xmath16 with transition rates @xmath17 given by the following expressions @xmath18 from which the rates @xmath19 follow immediately as @xmath20 in addition we have the transitions for the demography with rate @xmath13 , e.g. for the transition from recovered to susceptibles @xmath21 .",
    "this formulation defines the stochastic process completely to capture demographic noise and will be the basis for the multi - strain model to be described in the following .",
    "the above mentioned deterministic ode model describes in mean field approximation the dynamics of the mean values , e.g. @xmath22 the dynamics for the mean value is then given by inserting the master equation @xmath23 with the mean field approximation @xmath24 . carried out for all mean",
    "values @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 gives a closed ode system for the sir dynamics , which is a deterministic system in the sense that initial values determin the time course of the system for all times .",
    "the mean field ode system reads , now omitting the brackets for mean values , @xmath28 and has only fixed points as possible stationary solutions , i.e. attractors .",
    "transients under certain parameter values oscillate into the fixed point , hence can be already more complex than the final attractor .",
    "stochastic versions of such models with only fixed points possible as attractors but oscillating transients are reported to also show stabilization of the oscillations due to population noise @xcite .",
    "so the deterministic mean field ode models with their attractors give rather the minimal complexity caused by the model structure .      for two strains , @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ", we have the following sir - type model , now labelling the sir classes for the hosts that have seen the individual strains .",
    "susceptibles to both strains ( s ) get infected with strain @xmath0 ( @xmath29 ) or strain @xmath1 ( @xmath30 ) , with force of infection @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "they recover from infection with strain @xmath0 ( becoming @xmath33 ) or from strain @xmath1 ( becoming @xmath34 ) , with recovery rate @xmath35 . in this",
    "recovered class , people have full immunity against the strain that they were exposed to and infected , and also , temporary immunity against the other strain ( called period of temporary cross - immunity ) . after this , with rate @xmath36 , they enter again in the susceptible classes ( @xmath37 respectively @xmath38 ) , where the index represents the first infective strain .",
    "now , @xmath37 can be reinfected with strain @xmath1 ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath38 can be reinfected with strain @xmath0 ( @xmath39 ) , with infection rates @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the parameter @xmath42 in our model acts as `` inverse ade parameter '' , decreasing the infectivity of secondary infection , where people are more likely to be hospitalized because of the severity of the disease ( dhf ) , do not contributing to the force of infection as much as people with first infection do .",
    "finally , @xmath39 and @xmath39 go to the recovered class ( r ) , immune against all strains .",
    "we include demography of the host population by denoting the birth and death rate by @xmath13 , assuming constant population size @xmath43 .",
    "in the following reaction scheme we describe the transitions for first infection with strain @xmath0 and secondary infection with strain @xmath1 @xmath44 and for the reverse process , where the first infection is caused by strain @xmath1 and the secondary infection is caused by strain @xmath0 . @xmath45",
    "the demographic transitions are @xmath46 defining the system of two strains completely .",
    "the stochastic version is now in complete analogy to the previous sir model , and we can calculate the mean field equations ( or simply read it off from the reaction scheme directly ) .",
    "the mean field ode system for the two strain epidemiological system is @xmath47 we consider @xmath48 , @xmath49 for the moment , hence no epidemiological assymetry between the strains .    to take biological information from experiences in dengue into account",
    "we fixe the transition rates of the model as far as is known , and only will vary the unknown parameters @xmath50 and eventually @xmath9 .",
    "future work will have to also adjust the other parameters better to describe actual data of dengue cases .",
    "the parameter values are , if not otherwise explicitly stated , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for the chaotic attractors we take the exemplaric values",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56",
    ". we will also vary @xmath50 continuously to obtain bifurcation diagrams @xcite .",
    "we will first look at time series simulations of the present model , eq . system ( [ ode2strain ] ) , and from there we performed a detailed analysis of chaos , investigating state space plots for various values for @xmath50 , observing a rich structure of attractors from fixed points to bifurcating limit cycles and chaotic attractors .",
    "finally , we will show whole bifurcation diagrams for a systematic analysis for the entire parameter region of @xmath57 for various values of the temporary cross - immunity @xmath9 .      in order to classify the dynamic pattern of the model for various parameters we discard long transients which would carry some information of the initial conditions .",
    "so we neglect the first 2000 years in the following simulations .",
    "we first simulate time series for @xmath59 , see fig .",

    "spiraling into a fixed point often indicates a nearby periodic orbit .",
    "irregular transients indicate chaotic behaviour in neighbouring parameter regions etc .",
    "hence , even if dengue fever would be evolutionarily younger than the mentioned 2000 years of transient , the observed pattern would still give information about the dynamics of the system .",
    "also the stochastic version of this deterministic mean field model would be rather more complex than the attractor classification and not simpler @xcite , of course besides extinction due to population fluctuations for eventually very low numbers of infected .",
    "rather low troughs are observed for the total number of infected leading to unrealistically low numbers of infected on average in low epidemic times .",
    "the present deterministic model can be interpreted as a mean field model for stochastic models capturing the effect of population noise e.g. in terms of master equations as mentioned before @xcite .",
    "the ode solutions are then the mean values of such stochastic models .",
    "population fluctuations would in the present case drive always the system to extinction .      investigating time series for @xmath62 ,",
    "as would be realistic for dengue fever due to more severe disease upon reinfection , hence larger chance of being hospitalized , also indicates more complicated dynamic behaviour than just simple fixed point or limit cycles . discarding the first @xmath63 years ,",
