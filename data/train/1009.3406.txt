    "in order to determine the rates of relaxation to equilibrium in kinetic theory , kac derived the following boltzmann - like equation , commonly known as _ the kac equation _ : @xmath11 \\,{d}w \\,{d}\\theta \\qquad(v \\in\\mathbb{r } , t > 0)\\hspace*{-26pt}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with some specific probability density function @xmath4 as initial datum . the resulting cauchy problem admits a unique solution within the class of all probability density functions on @xmath12 .",
    "such a solution provides the probability distribution at any time of the velocity of a single particle in a chaotic bath of like molecules _ moving on the real line _ ; see kac ( @xcite , @xcite ) and mckean ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that the probability measure @xmath13 determined by @xmath0 converges to a distinguished gaussian law in the _ variational metric _ , namely @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath16 and , for any metric space @xmath17 , @xmath18 stands for the borel class on @xmath17 .",
    "it should be recalled that ( [ eq : convergenza ] ) holds true if and only if the initial datum has finite second moment and @xmath16 is the value of this moment .",
    "the proof of the `` if '' part of this assertion is given in dolera ( @xcite ) by adapting arguments explained in carlen and lu ( @xcite ) , whereas the proof of the `` only if '' part is contained in gabetta and regazzini ( @xcite ) .    in regard to the speed of approach to equilibrium , it has been proven that @xmath19 holds , with @xmath20 being some suitable constant depending only on the behavior of @xmath4 , when @xmath4 has finite fourth moment and @xmath21 is valid for some @xmath22 ; see dolera , gabetta and regazzini ( @xcite ) .",
    "this work will be refered to as dgr throughout the rest of the present paper .",
    "inequality ( [ eq : dgr ] ) is known as _ mckean s conjecture _ and the above statement constitutes the first satisfactory support of this conjecture .",
    "other bounds with respect to weak metrics have been given in gabetta and regazzini ( @xcite ) .",
    "at the end of section 2.2 of dgr , the question of whether the upper bound in ( [ eq : dgr ] ) can be improved is posed . to the best of the authors knowledge",
    ", this problem has not yet been tackled , except for a hint on page 370 of carlen , carvalho and gabetta ( @xcite ) . the main proposition in the present paper states that the answer is in the affirmative only in the rather peculiar case in which the _ fourth cumulant _ of the density @xmath23 is zero .",
    "the term `` fourth cumulant '' of a probability distribution @xmath24 on @xmath25 refers to the quantity @xmath26 with @xmath27 , under the assumption that the fourth moment is finite .",
    "this cumulant is zero , for example , when @xmath24 is gaussian .    in view of this fact",
    ", one could comment on the main proposition by noting that improvements of the rate expressed by ( [ eq : dgr ] ) turn out to be impossible when @xmath4 is dissimilar to all of the members in the class of all gaussian probability density functions .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we recall that , given the fourier  stieltjes transform @xmath28 of @xmath24 , the @xmath29th cumulant of @xmath24 is defined to be the coefficient of @xmath30 in the taylor expansion of @xmath31 ; see , for example , sections 3.143.15 of stuart and ord ( @xcite ) .    as a further remark on the aforementioned proposition , it is worth noting its resemblance to well - known facts related to the approximation of the distribution function @xmath32 of the `` standardized '' sum of @xmath33 independent and identically distributed random variables with finite variance , by the standard gaussian distribution @xmath34",
    "indeed , in general , @xmath32 is approximated by @xmath34 , except for terms of order @xmath35 . however , higher orders of approximation hold when the skewness and kurtosis of the common distribution of each summand are zero .",
    "lyapounov ( @xcite ) was the pioneer of these kinds of problems , followed by cramr ( @xcite ) , esseen ( @xcite ) and others .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] contains the presentation of the main results .",
    "section [ sec3 ] deals with the basic preliminary facts which pave the way for proofs of the main results .",
    "it is split into two subsections .",
    "the former consists of a brief description of the probabilistic interpretation , according to which @xmath36 can be seen as distribution of a random weighted sum of random variables .",
    "the latter is devoted to the analysis of the error associated with the approximation of the law of certain weighted sums of independent random variables to the gaussian distribution .",
    "section [ sec4 ] contains the proofs of the main results stated in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "finally , some purely technical details are deferred to the , together with the proofs of two lemmas formulated in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "in order to present the main results we intend to prove in this paper , it is worth mentioning the following weak version of kac s problem ( [ eq : kac ] ) proposed in bobylev ( @xcite ) . taking the fourier transform of both sides of ( [ eq : kac ] ) yields @xmath37 with initial datum @xmath38 . it should be noted that if @xmath39 is the fourier ",

    "let @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the @xmath29th moment and the absolute @xmath29th moment of @xmath40 , respectively , and let @xmath48 be the _",
    "symmetrized form of _",
    "@xmath40 defined by @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the set @xmath51 .    a precise statement of the fact that the rate @xmath2 may be the best possible one",
    "is contained in the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : invalicabilita ] suppose that @xmath40 possesses finite fourth moment @xmath52 and that @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath16 be the value of @xmath54 .",
    "there then exists a strictly positive constant @xmath55 , depending only on the behavior of @xmath40 , for which @xmath56 holds true for every @xmath57 .",
    "the proof of this theorem , deferred to section [ sec4 ] , also contains a precise quantification of @xmath55 . since latexmath:[\\[{\\sup_{b \\in\\mathscr{b}(\\mathbb{r } ) } } |\\mathsf{p}(b ) - \\mathsf { q}(b)| = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{\\mathbb{r } }    @xmath24 are absolutely continuous probability distributions with densities @xmath59 and @xmath28 , respectively , as an immediate consequence of theorem [ thm : invalicabilita ] , it follows that @xmath60 is true for the solution @xmath0 of ( [ eq : kac ] ) , provided that the initial datum @xmath4 yields a probability measure @xmath40 with the same properties as in theorem [ thm : invalicabilita ] . from ( [ eq : invalicabilita2 ] ) , it plainly follows that any inequality such as @xmath61 is _ not _ valid when @xmath62 vanishes at infinity .",
    "this clarifies why inequality ( [ eq : dgr ] ) can be viewed as sharp .",
    "we now analyze the effect of assuming that @xmath63 .",
    "[ thm : d+delta ] consider kac s equation ( [ eq : kac ] ) with initial datum @xmath4 such that @xmath64 for some @xmath65 in @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "further , let @xmath39 , the fourier transform of @xmath4 , satisfy the usual tail condition ( [ eq : cue ] ) for some strictly positive  @xmath59 .",
    "there then exist a strictly positive constant @xmath68 and a function @xmath69 which vanishes at infinity , for which @xmath70 in particular , if @xmath65 belongs to @xmath710,2[$ ] , one can take @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "useful information for quantifying @xmath74 can be found in sections [ sec43 ] , [ sec44 ] and appendices [ app2 ] and [ app4 ] .",
    "since even cumulants @xmath75 of the gaussian distribution @xmath76 vanish for and @xmath77 , one is led to think that the approach to equilibrium of @xmath13 might become faster when the symmetrized form of the initial datum gives an increasing number of zero even cumulants .",
    "[ thm : piuottimo ] consider problem ( [ eq : kac ] ) and maintain the same notation as before for @xmath4 , @xmath40 , @xmath48 , @xmath39 and @xmath78 .",
    "further , assume that there exist an integer @xmath79 greater than 2 and a number @xmath65 in @xmath66 for which :    @xmath80 ;    the cumulants @xmath75 of @xmath81 vanish for @xmath82 ;    @xmath39 meets ( [ eq : cue ] ) for some strictly positive @xmath59 .",
    "there then exists a strictly positive constant @xmath83 for which @xmath84 holds true .",
    "useful information for quantifying @xmath85 can be found in section [ sec44 ] and appendix  [ app2 ] .",
    "it should be noted that , except for the centered gaussian law , the most common distributions do not share condition ( ii ) , at least for large values of @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to believe that theorem [ thm : invalicabilita ] covers the usual applications",
    ".    it would be interesting to check when , under suitable conditions for the initial distribution , the value @xmath10 for the rate of relaxation to equilibrium is actually obtained .",
    "the following propositions resolve this issue , under the additional condition that all moments of @xmath40 are finite .",
    "it therefore remains to check whether this moment assumption can actually be recovered from this high order of relaxation to equilibrium .",
    "this problem will be tackled in a forthcoming work .",

    "observe that the wild formula [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : wild ] ) in section [ sec31 ] ] implies that@xmath92 when the initial datum is of the type ( [ eq : classespeciale ] ) .",
    "therefore , if one assumes there exists some @xmath93 vanishing at infinity so that @xmath94 , then the total variation @xmath95 of @xmath88 satisfies @xmath96 for all positive @xmath97 , which is tantamount to asserting that @xmath88 is the null measure .",
    "this provides a proof for the following result .",

    "thus , if all of the moments of @xmath40 are finite , then the value for the rate of convergence to equilibrium that one can not sharpen is just @xmath10 , unless @xmath40 is gaussian .",
    "to pave the way for the proofs of the main statements , this section presents some necessary preliminary facts and results .",
    "first , it explains the probabilistic meaning of wild s series , originally pointed out in mckean ( @xcite ) .",
    "second , it gives new asymptotic expansions for the characteristic function of weighted sums of independent and identically distributed random variables , which complement analogous statements formulated in , for example , chapter 8 of gnedenko and kolmogorov ( @xcite ) , chapter 6 of petrov ( @xcite ) and section 3.2 of dgr .",
    "following wild ( @xcite ) , one can express the solution @xmath42 of ( [ eq : kacfou ] ) as a time - dependent mixture of characteristic functions , that is , @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 denotes the so - called _ wild product _ defined by @xmath103    the wild series , thanks to a symmetry property of the wild product , yields a useful decomposition of @xmath13 which we will use later .",

    "the next description of the probabilistic reinterpretation of ( [ eq : wild ] ) closely follows section 3.1 of dgr .",
    "accordingly , we introduce , using exactly the same notation adopted therein , the measurable space @xmath110 as a product , together with its coordinate random elements @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "we then recall the definitions of the random elements @xmath115 , @xmath116 given in terms of _ mckean trees _ and put @xmath117 .",
    "concerning the random variables @xmath116 , recall the fundamental equality @xmath118 which holds true whenever @xmath112 belongs to @xmath119 .",
    "now , for some fixed initial datum @xmath40 for problem ( [ eq : kacfou ] ) , define a family @xmath120 of probability measures on @xmath110 according to ( 12 ) in dgr .",
    "next , consider the random variable @xmath121 and note , via the wild formula , that @xmath122 @xmath13 being the solution of ( [ eq : kacfou ] ) with @xmath40 as initial datum .",
    "consequently , the random variables @xmath123 turn out to be _ conditionally independent _ , given @xmath124 , with respect to each @xmath125 . moreover , since @xmath124 and @xmath126 are independent , one can think of the conditional probability distribution of @xmath127 given @xmath124 as the distribution of a weighted sum of independent random variables .",
    "indeed , for any fixed elementary case @xmath128 in @xmath129 , one can define the random variable @xmath130 on @xmath110 , for which @xmath131 holds @xmath125-almost surely in @xmath128 .",
    "this last equality plays a central role in the rest of the paper since it allows us to work on a finite sum of independent random variables using typical tools of the _ central limit problem_. in this context , it is important to examine the behavior of the moments of the random variable @xmath127 .",

    "the expansions given here turn out to be more careful than the analogous ones contained in the aforementioned work since it is now assumed that the common probability law of the summands possesses moments of arbitrarily high order .",
