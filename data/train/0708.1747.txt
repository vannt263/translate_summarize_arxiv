    "to understand the properties of classical solutions of the gravitational field equations it is essential to study the orbits of test particles and light rays in these space - times .",
    "on the one hand , this is important from an observational point of view , since it is only matter and light that is observed and that therefore can give insight into a given gravitational field @xcite .",
    "the study of the motion of test particles in gravitational fields has thus significant practical applications . on the other hand , this study is also important from a fundamental point of view , since the motion of matter and light can be used to classify a given space - time , to decode its structure and to highlight its characteristics .",
    "particles and light have been used since a long time to discuss the properties of solutions of einstein s field equations .",
    "all solutions of the geodesic equation in a schwarzschild gravitational field can be found in a seminal paper of hagihara @xcite . with the same mathematical tools one can solve the geodesic equation in a reissner ",
    "nordstrm space ",
    "time @xcite .",
    "the analytic solutions of the geodesic equation in a kerr and kerr  newman space  time are also known ( see @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "analytic solutions are the starting point for approximation methods for the description of real stellar , planetary , comet , asteroid , or satellite trajectories ( see e.g. @xcite )",
    ". analytic solutions of the geodesic equation can also serve as test beds for numerical codes for the dynamics of binary systems in the extreme stellar mass ratio case and also for the calculation of corresponding gravitational wave templates .    here",
    "we discuss orbits in a static spherically symmetric gravitational field , where the space ",
    "time metric is expressed in terms of schwarzschild  like coordinates , @xmath0 we further assume , that the space ",
    "time is asymptotically flat .",
    "well - known examples of such space  times are the schwarzschild solution and the reissner - nordstrm solution , both representing black hole solutions with an event horizon and a central singularity . in these solutions , the two metric coefficients are not independent , but related to each other , @xmath1 . at the event horizon @xmath2 , while the curvature invariants remain finite . at the origin , in contrast , the curvature invariants diverge , indicating the presence of a classical singularity .    when matter fields other than the maxwell field are coupled to gravity , not only black hole solutions arise but globally regular solutions can appear as well .",
    "interesting examples of such globally regular solutions of the coupled einstein - matter field equations are boson stars , which form when a scalar field is coupled to gravity , or magnetic monopoles , which originate in grand unified theories .",
    "these solutions neither possess an event horizon nor a central singularity .",
    "their curvature invariants are finite everywhere , and the two metric functions no longer satisfy the relation @xmath1 , instead @xmath3 .",
    "our interest here focuses on orbits of test particles and light rays in such space  times , and , in particular , in space ",
    "times emerging in the presence of globally regular magnetic monopoles @xcite as described in section [ sec : gravmonopoles ] .",
    "magnetic monopoles arise as topological defects in theories which undergo spontaneous symmetry breaking . in general ,",
    "magnetic monopoles exist if the mapping of the vacuum manifold , associated with the symmetry breaking , onto the two - sphere is non - trivial .",
    "the existence of magnetic monopoles is consequently a generic prediction of grand unification .",
    "if magnetic monopoles were indeed present in the universe , they would have a host of astrophysical and cosmological consequences .",
    "one might even think of calculating the form of gravitational waves created by scattering processes at such monopole solutions , since these may contribute to a stochastic gravitational wave background emerging in the very early universe .    for magnetic monopoles the einstein - matter equations depend on two dimensionless parameters , which represent ratios of the characteristic mass scales present in the theory .",
    "depending on the values of these two parameters , the metric coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 can exhibit an interesting behaviour : the component @xmath4 then approaches zero within a certain domain , @xmath6 , while @xmath5 tends to infinity at the special value @xmath7 , and remains finite elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we here demonstrate , that this intriguing behavior is clearly reflected in the particle orbits .",
    "( when one considers su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills theory without higgs fields , also globally regular configurations result @xcite .",
    "these solutions are unstable @xcite , however , and this makes them less attractive to study orbits in their vicinity . )    in section [ sec : eom ] we recall the general set of equations of motion for test particles and light rays and also discuss the effective potential .",
    "we then review a number of physical quantities relevant for the interpretation of the orbits of the test particles and light rays and discuss the general features of singular limits of the metric functions in section [ sec : orbits ] . in section [ sec : gravmonopoles ] we recall the basic equations and main properties of gravitating non - abelian magnetic monopoles . in section [ sec :",

    "affine parameter , and we emphasize the peculiar features of the orbits , which arise for _ almost _ critical values of the parameters .",
    "we give our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we briefly recall the equations of motion for test particles and light in the general static spherically symmetric metric , eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) .",
    "because of spherical symmetry , one can restrict the motion to the equatorial plane .",
    "one obtains two constants of motion , the specific energy @xmath8 and the specific angular momentum @xmath9 ( i.e. , energy and angular momentum per unit mass for a particle ) , @xmath10 where for particles @xmath11 is the proper time , while for light it represents an affine parameter .",
    "then the only dynamical equation left is    @xmath12    where @xmath13 for particles and @xmath14 for light . exploiting energy and angular momentum conservation",
    "one obtains the equations for @xmath15 and @xmath16 as functions of @xmath17    @xmath18    eqs .",
    "( [ bahnexact : drds])-([bahnexact : drdt ] ) then give a complete description of the dynamics . from eq .",
    "( [ bahnexact : drds ] ) it is clear that the motion is restricted to the domain @xmath19 .      when reasoning by analogy to the newtonian case @xcite , a natural definition arises for an effective potential of the schwarzschild space ",
    "time from the geodesic equation . for the general asymptotically flat case we are discussing here",
    ", no such natural definition is available .",
    "therefore we propose a set of conditions which we consider to be natural properties of an effective potential , and which in our case are sufficient to give a unique definition for an effective potential .",
    "we thus suggest that an effective potential @xmath20 for an asymptotically flat space ",
    "time should possess the following properties :    1 .",
    "the effective potential should determine the equation of motion for the @xmath17coordinate : @xmath21 .",
    "2 .   the effective potential should obey the boundary condition @xmath22 .",
    "the first condition leads to @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant . to fix this constant",
    "we decompose the two metric functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 according to @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 , in accordance with asymptotic flatness , and we also exploit the second condition .",
    "the equation for the radial motion eq .",
    "( [ bahnexact : drds ] ) then becomes @xmath28 except for the first term all other terms tend to zero for @xmath29 , so that we can make the unique identification @xmath30 thus in general the effective potential depends on both constants of motion , on @xmath9 and on @xmath8 .    since the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eomeffpot ] ) is quadratic in @xmath8 , one can recast the equation in the form @xcite @xmath31 and identify the quantity @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 for @xmath29 .",
    "although @xmath32 is sometimes called an effective potential , it is not an effective potential in the sense of the above criteria .",
    "however , @xmath32 has the big advantage of being independent of the energy @xmath8 , and from @xmath35 one can easily determine the values of @xmath17 , which mark the turning points and thus give the range of the motion .",
    "thus the range of the motion of particles and light is most easily obtained from @xmath32 and independent of @xmath8 .",
    "however , the full features of the geodesics are obtained only from @xmath20 and are dependent on @xmath8 .",
    "for the subsequent discussion of the orbits in the space  time of a magnetic monopole it is instructive to first recall a number of physical properties relevant for the description of the motion .",
    "these are the proper time , the physical distance and the physical velocity .",
    "we then discuss the limiting features of a metric , when the metric coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 tend to zero or diverge .",
    "the curvature invariants here indicate the presence of a mere coordinate singularity or of a physical singularity .",
    "we first address these limits for the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm solutions , where @xmath36 .",
    "then we turn to the more general case , realized in the space  time of a gravitating magnetic monopole , where @xmath37 . here",
    "our statements about the limits should be interpreted to only mean `` very small '' and `` very large '' .",
    "the treatment of the limits in the strict mathematical sense will be discussed in a subsequent publication @xcite .",
    "these considerations are then used in section [ sec : numerics ] in order to obtain an interpretation of the calculated trajectories .",
    "they may be also of relevance , when one considers a `` splitting '' of space - time or a space  time `` without time '' , features which might occur in generalized models of gravity .",
    "an important feature of the motion of a particle is the proper time elapsing along its trajectory . along a radial trajectory ,",
    "e.g. , the proper time is given by @xmath38    now if a whole region arises in a space  time , where @xmath4 is very small ( @xmath39 ) , as in the case of the nearly critical space ",
    "times of a magnetic monopole , then in such a region @xmath40 is very small as well ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this means , that a particle does not feel anything like a singularity in such a region , but that it simply needs almost no proper time to traverse such a region .",
    "another relevant physical quantity is the distance as measured from the origin in a regular region of space  time , @xmath42    when @xmath2 at some coordinate value @xmath7 , the distance to @xmath7 becomes infinite , if @xmath43 is not integrable at @xmath7 .",
    "the space  time in the region @xmath44 then has infinite extent .",
    "the velocity @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ bahnexact : drdt ] ) is the coordinate velocity and not a physical velocity .",
    "a physical velocity is measured , e.g. , by an observer at rest in the given coordinate system .",
    "the proper time of such an observer at @xmath17 is given by @xmath46 , and the physical distance to the origin ( in a regular space  time ) has been defined in eq .",
    "( [ propdis ] ) .",
    "the radial velocity measured by such an observer at rest then is @xmath47 with the geodesic equation eq .",
    "( [ bahnexact : drdt ] ) this yields for the measured velocity @xmath48    the measured velocity is well defined in the allowed regions of the motion , which are restricted by the requirement of positivity of the radicand . clearly , the measured velocity of a particle is always limited by the velocity of light . for @xmath14",
    "the measured velocity is the light velocity .",
    "we note , that the velocity measured by an observer at rest does not depend on @xmath5",
    ".      to differentiate between mere coordinate singularities and physical singularities it is instructive to consider the curvature invariants .",
    "the simplest of these invariants is the kretschmann scalar @xmath49 . for the static spherically symmetric metric eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) the kretschmann scalar is given by @xmath50    in the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm solutions , for instance , the kretschmann scalar remains finite at the horizons , whereas it diverges at the classical physical singularities at the origin .",
    "the equations of motion eqs .",
    "( [ bahnexact : drds])-([bahnexact : drdt ] ) depend on the metric coefficients .",
    "the equations for @xmath51 and @xmath52 depend on the metric coefficient @xmath5 , and on the product @xmath53 , while the equation for @xmath45 further contains the factor @xmath4 .    to address the effects of _ almost _ singular metric coefficients on the orbits of particles and light ,",
    "we here distinguish two cases . in the first case , we consider space  times , where the metric coefficients satisfy the relation @xmath54 , such as , e.g. , the black hole space  times of the schwarzschild metric and the reissner - nordstrm metric .    in the second case we consider globally regular asympototically flat metrics , where the metric coefficients are constrained by the above relation only at spatial infinity , thus @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "these metrics include the generic space ",
    "time of a magnetic monopole ( see section [ sec : gravmonopoles ] ) .",
    "when certain critical values of the coupling constants are approached , such a globally regular space ",
    "time may , however , evolve towards a space  time with singular metric coefficients , possibly associated with physical singularities . studying the orbits of particles and light",
    "is expected to yield a deeper understanding of such limiting space  times .",
    "when @xmath54 , as , e.g. , in the schwarzschild and reissner  nordstrm solutions , the equations of motion reduce to    @xmath57    we now consider a number of effects relevant for the orbits , which arise when @xmath5 becomes very small or very large , as collected in the following table :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath58 depending on whether eq .",

    "the latter can be understood since in this case it needs a very small @xmath16 to generate a large proper time .",

    "interesting is also a glance at the proper time of a particle along these almost straight radial parts of the orbits .",
    "since @xmath144 is extremely small , a particle needs almost no proper time to traverse the inner region , as exemplified in fig .",

    "the particle motion is again understood by examining the effective potential .",
    "as before , the abrupt changes in the motion followed by the straight radial line segments are caused by the extreme decrease of the effective potential in the region @xmath165 , leading to vigorous attraction for the particle towards the origin . at the same time the particle needs almost no proper time to traverse the inner region .",

    "[ lastsub ]    as our last example for motion in the space  time of a gravitating monopole , we discuss a case with intermediate higgs mass , choosing the parameter set @xmath173 . here",
    "a new phenomenon arises : the limiting space ",

    "time evolves in this case as the critical solution is approached . as in the last example , we fix @xmath95 and increase @xmath96 , until the _ almost _ critical space ",
    "time is reached . as @xmath179 ( or analogously as @xmath142 ) the minimum of the metric function @xmath119 close to @xmath180 decreases , but it does not reach zero .",

    "[ series5a ] .",
    "the old minimum at @xmath7 is no longer affected by the final approach towards the critical solution .",
    "the true limiting solution thus divides space  time in a different way and consists of the interior region @xmath182 and the exterior region @xmath183 , where the exterior region may be subdivided into the intermediate region @xmath184 and the outer region @xmath162 .",
    "clearly , the metric of the limiting solution differs now from the metric of an extremal reissner ",
    "nordstrm black hole also in the exterior region of the limiting space  time @xmath183 .",
    "though for @xmath162 it is still close to an extremal reissner  nordstrm space ",

    "however , unlike that case , it decreases distinctly faster at @xmath121 than in the overall region @xmath161 .",
    "thus @xmath144 develops a minimum at @xmath121 quite analogous to the minimum of @xmath119 . as a consequence ,",
    "the product of @xmath144 and @xmath5 changes only slightly in the vicinity of @xmath121 , while , in contrast , @xmath185 changes very rapidly in the vicinity of @xmath7 .",
    "the implication for the curvature of the space ",
    "time is , that there appears no singularity at @xmath121 .",
    "the kretschmann scalar remains perfectly smooth there , as seen in fig .",
    "[ series5a ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the kretschmann scalar still becomes very large at @xmath7 , but it will not diverge there in the limit . the critical space ",
    "time is thus expected to correspond to a space  time with a degenerate black hole horizon at @xmath121 , and with no singularities at either @xmath7 or at the origin .",
    "let us now address the orbits of particles and also of light rays in this _ almost _ limiting space  time .",
    "we again choose for the angular momentum the previous value @xmath186 .",
    "the corresponding potential @xmath32 is seen in fig .",
    "[ series5a ] .",
    "_ time  like geodesics _",
    "we display a set of characteristic particle orbits in fig .",
    "[ series5b ] .",
    "since @xmath121 is a minimum of @xmath4 the potential @xmath32 also exhibits a minimum at @xmath121 ( the @xmath187 term is negligible here ) . for a very small minimal energy this implies an almost circular motion at @xmath121 , exhibited in ( a ) .",
    "the associated effective potential @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "[ series5a ] ( f ) ) also assumes its minimal value at @xmath121 .",
    "as the energy is increased , the effective potential changes drastically and rapidly assumes huge negative values in the region bounded by @xmath7 ( and not only the region bounded by @xmath121 ) .",
    "thus @xmath7 still plays a most significant role for the orbits . for instance , the energy for the bound orbit in ( b ) is again chosen , such that the motion is limited by the circle at @xmath7 .",
    "the motion then proceeds either on segments of that circle or on almost straight radial lines to and from the center ( with some reflection there ) .    at somewhat higher energies the bound orbits in the inner region ( c ) and ( e ) again exhibit smooth segments which alternate with almost straight radial lines to and from the center , where the abrupt directional changes occur at @xmath7 ( and at the center ) .",
    "this remarkable role of @xmath7 is preserved also in the weakly bound orbits ( g ) and in the escape orbits ( h ) and ( i ) . as discussed above",
    ", a particle needs very little proper time to traverse the inner region .",
    "the bound orbits in the outer region ( d ) and ( f ) , of course , do not penetrate far enough inside to experience any influence of @xmath7 .",

    "elliptic orbits with a perihelion shift",

    "[ series5c ] , while a set of orbits is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ series5d ] .",
    "the null geodesics are interesting due to the fact , that light rays can follow bound geodesics , as evident from the form of the potential @xmath32 .",
    "thus light can be captured by the source , but does not fall into any singularity , since the space ",
    "time is regular .",
    "the shape of the null geodesics is similar to the shape of the time  like geodesics , as seen in fig .",
    "[ series5d ] .",
    "the bound orbits ( a ) again exhibit smooth segments which alternate with almost straight radial lines to and from the center , with abrupt directional changes at @xmath7 ( and at the center ) , related to the fact that the effective potential becomes very large and negative in the region within the radius @xmath7 .",
    "this peculiar effect on the motion at and within radius @xmath7 is also seen in the scattering orbits at high enough energy ( c ) .",
    "the scattering orbits at lower energy ( b ) are deflected before they can experience any influence of @xmath7 .",
    "an accurate analysis and true interpretation of a given gravitational field can only be obtained through the exploration of the geodesics of particles and light rays in this space  time .",
    "such an investigation is particularly important in regions , where the space ",
    "time metric exhibits unusual behavior , as for example in the vicinity of a black hole event horizon .    in this paper",
    "we have discussed the motion of particles and light rays in the gravitational field of a magnetic monopole which is characterized by two dimensionless constants , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , where @xmath95 signifies the relative strength of gravity , while @xmath96 is the ratio of the higgs boson to the vector boson mass in the non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "the space  time of a non - abelian monopole is globally regular .",
    "its curvature invariants are finite everywhere .",
    "however , globally regular monopoles can not exist for large values of the gravitational coupling strength .",
    "simple dimensional reasoning shows , that black holes should form , when @xmath95 reaches values on the order of one @xcite . indeed , at critical values of the parameters ( @xmath188 ) the space ",
    "time changes dramatically and the metric becomes singular .    as the critical space ",
    "time is approached for small values of @xmath96 , the metric coefficient @xmath119 tends to zero at @xmath118 , and the metric coefficient @xmath4 tends to zero in the interval @xmath189 .",
    "the effects on the particle orbits are then astounding .",
    "the orbits traversing the region , where @xmath7 is located , are hugely distorted as compared to ordinary bound orbits .",
    "while the orbits evolve smoothly until they reach the vicinity of @xmath7 , they then change abruptly direction and approach the center in almost straight radial lines .",
    "there they are reflected , and move in almost straight radial lines out to @xmath7 , where they change abruptly direction again and evolve smoothly further .",
    "this intriguing pattern of movement is caused by the steep drop of the effective potential for @xmath165 , leading to a vigorous attraction of particles or light rays in this region .",
    "also , particles need almost no proper time to traverse this region ( @xmath165 ) .    for larger values of @xmath96 , the critical space ",
    "time is distinctly different @xcite .",
    "the metric coefficient @xmath119 acquires a second minimum at @xmath181 , which tends to zero in the limit , while the minimum at @xmath7 remains finite .",
    "still it is @xmath7 , and the steep drop of the effective potential associated with it , which strongly dominates the orbits in the interior , causing abrupt directional changes and vigorous attraction towards the center , along with almost no lapse of proper time .",
    "we note , that this kind of research may be extended to metrics associated with stationary axially symmetric solutions of the einstein field equations .",
