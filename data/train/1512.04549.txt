    "the distribution of many galaxy properties , including color , morphology and star formation rate ( sfr ) , is bimodal , reflecting the existence of two broad types of galaxies : red , old , quiescent early - type galaxies and dust - reddened or blue , late - type disk galaxies with ongoing star formation .",
    "this bimodality is related to the variations in the cold gas content , which lead to different levels of star formation and eventually to quenching . whether the reasons for galaxies getting quenched",
    "are internal or external is of critical importance .",
    "one way to shed light on the processes responsible for quenching is to compare the sfr of galaxies of a given stellar mass ( m@xmath1 ) in different environments . as shown by @xcite",
    ", a clearer picture can be obtained considering separately relationships with bulge- and disk - masses .",
    "the correlation found between sfr and the total m@xmath1 has been interpreted as the result of the balancing of inflows of cosmological gas and outflows due to the feedback @xcite , thus being sensitive to any physical mechanism affecting the amount of gas available for star formation .",
    "the star formation quenching seems to be stronger in clusters , which have a higher fraction of early - types and a lower fraction of late - type galaxies than the field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that they are extremely effective in cutting off the galaxy s ability to form stars .",
    "examples of external processes acting in high - density regions include ram - pressure stripping @xcite , high speed galaxy encounters ( galaxy harassment ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , galaxy - galaxy mergers @xcite , and removal of the warm and hot halo gas ( strangulation ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most direct way to isolate the effects of the environment is to study the trends in the galaxy population mix in clusters , where most of the aforementioned processes are strongly active , and compare them with the field .",
    "furthermore , it is useful to analyze the radial distribution of member galaxies and how their properties change within the clusters , since the cluster - centric distance traces the cluster density profile and is an approximate time - scale for the star formation quenching @xcite .",
    "while so far the sfr-@xmath6 relation has been largely investigated in the field , only few studies focused on clusters . using local galaxy field samples , @xcite and @xcite showed that the local density mostly changes the fraction of passive galaxies but has little effect on the sfr - m@xmath1 relation . focusing on one cluster at the time",
    ", also @xcite and @xcite failed to identify any difference in the sfr distribution of cluster and field galaxies and did not detect any population of galaxies departing from the ms .",
    "this implies that the quenching of star formation is a relatively fast transition . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite ( @xmath7 ) and @xcite ( @xmath8 ) found evidence that galaxies in clusters have lower sfrs than galaxies of similar mass in the field .",
    "a population of galaxies with reduced sfr at given mass was discovered in clusters by @xcite at @xmath9 and @xcite at @xmath10 .",
    "what is still missing is a detailed study of the local cluster population in a statistically meaningful sample .",
    "this is now possible thanks to the omegawings survey , which covers 46 clusters at @xmath2 , each over a field of 1deg@xmath11 , allowing us to study the properties of @xmath12 galaxies in an homogeneous sample .",
    "our analysis considers all galaxies together , regardless of their morphology . a detailed study as a function of morphologies is underway ( calvi et al . in prep .",
    ", paccagnella et al . in prep . ) .",
    "we adopt a @xcite initial mass function in the mass range 0.15 - 120 m@xmath13 .",
    "the cosmological constants assumed are @xmath14 , @xmath15 and h@xmath16 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 .",
    "the galaxy sample is extracted from the wide - field nearby galaxy - cluster survey ( wings ) , that includes 76 x - ray selected clusters of galaxies with @xmath2 , and from the recent extension of this project , omegawings , that quadruples the area covered by the optical imaging for 46 clusters ( , moretti et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the cluster sample covers a wide range of velocity dispersion ( @xmath18 500 - 1300 km / s ) and x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath19 0.2 - 5 @xmath20 erg / s ) .",
    "the spectroscopic targets were selected based on b and v photometry .",
    "the spectroscopic catalogs have been corrected for both geometrical and magnitude incompleteness , using the ratio of number of spectra yielding a redshift to the total number of galaxies in the parent photometric catalog , calculated both as a function of v magnitude and radial projected distance from the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) . in this work ,",
    "31 clusters with a spectroscopic completeness higher than 50@xmath21 are considered .",
    "a galaxy is considered a cluster member if its redshift lies within @xmath22 from the cluster mean redshift .",
    "the virial radius r@xmath5 is computed from @xmath23 following @xcite and used to scale the cluster - centric distances of member galaxies .",
    "the field control sample is extracted from the non - member galaxies in the redshift range @xmath24 .",
    "we derive sfrs , star formation histories ( sfhs ) , @xmath6 , luminosity- and mass- weighted ages ( lwa and mwa , respectively ) by fitting the spectra with the spectrophotometric model fully described in .",
    "all the main spectrophotometric features ( i.e. the continuum flux and shape , the equivalent widths of emission and absorption lines ) are reproduced by summing the theoretical spectra of simple stellar populations of 12 different ages ( from @xmath25 to approximately @xmath26 years ) .",
    "stellar masses used are masses locked into stars , including both those that are still in the nuclear - burning phase , and remnants such as white dwarfs , neutron stars and stellar black holes .",
    "the current sfr estimates are derived by fitting the flux of the emission lines , whose luminosities are entirely attributed to star formation , neglecting all the other mechanisms that can produce a ionizing flux , and is taken to be the average during the last 20 myr .",
    "they suffer from aperture effects ; total values are computed by rescaling the ones obtained by fitting the optical spectra , calibrated on the v - band fiber magnitude , to the total v magnitude .",
    "the reliability of the total sfrs were tested comparing the results with independent sfr determinations .",
    "as discussed in , emission lines can be measured in our spectra down to a limit of 2  , while any emission measurement below this threshold is considered unreliable .",
    "this sets a lower detection limit that translates into a specific star formation rate ( the sfr per unit of stellar mass , ssfr ) limit of @xmath27 . to be conservative",
    ", we will consider as star forming only galaxies with @xmath28 , and we have verified that moving the threshold does not severely affect our results .    to assemble our final sample , we consider all galaxies above the mass completeness limit of @xmath2910@xmath30 m@xmath13 , derived as in @xcite . in clusters ,",
    "we exclude bcgs and consider all galaxies within 2@xmath4 .",
    "the agn contribution can be neglected @xcite .",

    "this relation agrees with other mss at similar redshifts confirming the reliability of our field .",
    "a change of the sfr - m@xmath1 relation with the environment is well visible . even though galaxies in clusters can be as actively star - forming as galaxies in the field , a population with reduced sfrs is evident in the former , while it is much less noticeable in the latter .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test on the sfr weighted distributions excludes the possibility that the samples are extracted from the same parent population with a probability @xmath35 .",
    "the test rejects the null hypothesis also for the two weighted mass distributions , at a lower level . to exclude that the differences in the sfr distributions are driven by different mass distributions",
    ", we performed 100 monte carlo simulations extracting randomly a subsample of sf galaxies with the same mass distribution of the field from the cluster sample .",
    "the ks test disproves at a significant level the null hypothesis in 100@xmath21 of the cases .",
    "hereafter , we further distinguish between _ purely star - forming _",
    "( psf ) and _ transition _ galaxies , the former being within 1.5@xmath31 from the field fit , the latter lying below -1.5@xmath31 . with this",
    "cut , transition galaxies represent @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) of the sf cluster ( field ) population and 9@xmath21 ( 4@xmath21 ) of the full cluster ( field ) sample .",
    "we now investigate the spatial distribution of transition galaxies within the clusters ( 0@xmath382 ) and their impact on the sfr - m@xmath1 relation .",
    "figure [ sfrm6 ] shows star - forming galaxies in 6 different bins of projected cluster - centric distance ; the field is reported for reference .",
    "the median sfrs of all sf galaxies , weighted for incompleteness , have been calculated in 4 mass bins .",
    "the quoted uncertainties on the medians are estimated as @xmath39 , where @xmath31 is the standard deviation about the median and n is the number of galaxies @xcite .",
    "transition galaxies are mainly found within 0.6r@xmath5 , where they represent more than @xmath40 of all sf cluster galaxies and are able to significantly lower the median sfr-@xmath6 relation . in these inner regions ,",
    "we also notice a lack of psf galaxies .",
    "the frequency of transition galaxies decreases with increasing distance until they almost disappear outside @xmath4 .",
    "we note that for @xmath41 , that corresponds to the radius covered by most of the clusters , the small sample statistics prevents us from drawing solid conclusions , although results do not change if we consider only the 11 clusters that reach 2r@xmath5 .",
    "both mass and environment play an important role in driving galaxy evolution .",
    "the median mass is independent on distance , for psf , transition and passive galaxies separately ( plot not shown ) , indicating that there is no strong mass segregation .",
    "this result suggests that mass and position within the clusters are not strictly related and might play a different role in galaxy quenching .",
    "we can therefore try to separate the two contributions and understand how the impact of the environment depends on the mass of the galaxy .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ frac ] shows the incidence of each sub - population as a function of cluster - centric distance within two mass bins , while the right panel shows the incidence of each sub - population as a function of mass in two distance bins .",
    "both the mass and radius separation values ( respectively @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) used to divide the sample are chosen to have similar numbers of galaxies in each bin . the transition to psf galaxy ratio ( top )",
    "strongly depends on distance , being @xmath440.6 at @xmath45 and 0.8 at @xmath46 within 0.3@xmath4 , and rapidly decreases going outward .",
    "the fraction of transition galaxies to the total ( bottom ) also decreases with distance , but is almost constant with mass , in agreement e.g. with @xcite .",
    "passive and psf galaxy fractions strongly depend on both distance and mass .",
    "passive galaxies are the dominant population at all masses inside @xmath4 and decrease going outwards , mirrored by psf galaxies , in agreement with previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "opposite trends are detected in the field , where psf galaxies represent @xmath4470% of all galaxies at low masses and 50% at higher masses , while passive galaxies are @xmath47 at low masses and are nearly as common as psf galaxies at higher masses . in clusters , trends with mass are less pronounced within 0.6@xmath48 , where both psf and passive fractions are almost constant , but well visible at larger distances , where they resemble what is observed in the field .",
    "overall , environmental effects seem to dominate within 0.6@xmath4 : the variation of the relative number of transition and psf galaxies with distance is the main responsible of the decrease of the median sfr and of the change of the sfr - m@xmath1 relation seen in fig .",
    "[ sfrm ] .",
    "we now investigate whether transition galaxies have different properties from the psf galaxies .",
    "figure [ prop ] shows how the lwa ( left ) and ( b - v ) color ( right ) change as a function of the position on the sfr - m@xmath1 plane for cluster member galaxies .",
    "moving from left to right and top to bottom , galaxies show redder colors and older lwas , with the transition population showing the largest values .",
    "the median lwa varies from @xmath445 gyr for transition galaxies to @xmath442 gyr for psf galaxies , comparable with the field values for all sf galaxies .",
    "the same trend is found also for the mwa ( plot not shown ) , but with a less marked gradient .    ]",
    "we also inspect the sfhs of the different galaxy populations , to trace the evolutionary path of transition galaxies .",
    "the spectral analysis allows us to derive an estimate of the sfrs at different cosmic times ; the initial 12 ages of the ssp spectra were further binned into four intervals with @xmath49 gyr and @xmath50 gyr ( see * ? ? ?",
    "recall that the current sfr , used to separate galaxies , is taken to be the average during the last 20 myr , thus is slightly different from the first bin of the sfhs .    to avoid the influence of the different mass distributions",
    ", we performed 100 monte carlo simulations .",
    "we randomly extracted a subsample of galaxies with the same mass distribution of psf galaxies from the passive and transition samples and computed the mean sfr for each population , in the 4 age intervals .",
    "errors on mean values have been computed as bootstrap standard deviations .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ sfh ] .",
    "overall , the sfh decline gets steeper going from psf to transition and passive galaxies .",
    "consistently with the analysis of the lwas , transition galaxies are clearly an evolved population with respect to psf galaxies , having their sfr suppressed a long time ago ( 2 - 5 gyr ) .",
    "a more accurate estimation of the quenching timescales is not possible do to the time resolution of our spectrophotometric code .",
    "if sf galaxies are affected by environmental mechanisms when they move from the field to groups or clusters , we should see a signature of this transformation that depends on the timescale over which it occurs .    comparing the sfr-@xmath6 relation of sf galaxies in clusters and in the field and looking at variations as a function of the cluster - centric distance allow us to put constraints on both the range of environments where star formation is quenched and the average timescale over which it happens .",
    "rapid quenching processes would leave the sfr - m@xmath1 relation unperturbed with respect to the field , moving sf galaxies directly to the red sequence . on the contrary ,",
    "slow quenching would increase the number of galaxies with reduced sfrs resulting in a different sfr - m@xmath1 relation .",
    "we find a population of low sf galaxies , which is rare in the field , suggesting that for these galaxies the transition from sf to passive occurs on a sufficiently long timescale to let us see them in the process of being quenched .",
    "we stress that our analysis can not identify galaxies quenching on short timescales , that would move quickly from the sf ms to being passive .",
    "we showed that this slow process is confined to galaxies within @xmath4 and that only within @xmath51 this causes the median sfr - m@xmath1 relation to detach from the observed field ms .",
    "in addition , in the inner regions galaxy fractions are nearly constant with mass .",
    "the analysis of the sfhs , together with the variation of the properties of galaxies in the sfr - m@xmath1 plane , support this scenario : transition galaxies have older lwas and redder colors than ms galaxies and show reduced mean sfrs at least in the last @xmath52gyr .",
    "stellar mass seems to play a minor role , with the observed trends displaying a much weaker dependence on m@xmath1 than on distance .",
    "we can not exclude that some transition galaxies are passive galaxies returning to the sf population due to accretion of gas - rich satellites or exchange of material during merging , but this channel seems improbable because of the many processes acting to remove gas or suppress the gas reservoir in clusters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the results presented here agree with the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite at @xmath53 , who found that the sfrs of sf galaxies decline towards the cluster core from the values observed in the field .",
    "also numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) support the slow quenching scenario , finding kinematic segregation between normally star forming galaxies and those with reduced sfrs .",
    "this analysis , together with the work of @xcite and @xcite , who depicted a population of galaxies with reduced sfrs , at @xmath54 , suggest that this transition population was already in place at higher redshifts .",
    "we conclude that , even if cluster galaxies can be as star - forming as field galaxies , there are significant differences in their sfr distributions .",
    "clusters not only have a pre - existing larger population of passive galaxies , but also show a tail of low star - forming galaxies that is rare in the field . this evidence is predicted for strangulation models , in which the diffuse gas halo is rapidly stripped at the passage through the intracluster medium leaving available to the galaxy only its reservoir of molecular gas to form stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a natural step forward will be to further investigate the sfr - m@xmath1 relation as a function of local density and the global properties of the clusters , such as @xmath23 and @xmath55 and extend the halo mass range covered down to the group scale ( paccagnella et al . in prep . ) .",
    "such studies will shed further light on the processes causing galaxy quenching and the range of halo masses on which it occurs .",
