    "this is a review of theoretical and experimental work in the context of the manganese oxides widely known as manganites .",
    "these materials are currently being investigated by a sizable fraction of the condensed matter community , and their popularity is reaching levels comparable to that of the high temperature superconducting cuprates . from this review hopefully the reader will be able to understand the reasons behind this wide interest in manganites , the problems that have been solved in this context , and those that remain to be investigated .",
    "the authors have made a considerable effort in trying to include in this review the majority of what they consider to be the most relevant literature on the subject .",
    "however , clearly it is not possible to cover all aspects of the problem in a single manuscript . here",
    "the main focus has been directed into recent theoretical calculations that address the complex spin , charge , and/or orbital ordered phases of manganites , which have important and prominent intrinsic inhomogeneities , and also on the recent experimental results against which those calculations can be compared . due to the complexity of the models needed to address manganites ,",
    "it is natural that the most robust results have been obtained with computational tools , and those are the calculations that will be emphasized in the text .",
    "the continuous growth of available computer power has allowed simulations that were simply impossible not long ago .",
    "in addition , the physics of manganites appears dominated by intrinsic inhomogeneities and its description is quite difficult in purely analytic frameworks that usually assume uniform states .",
    "however , several calculations , notably some mean - field approximations , have also reached a high accuracy level and they are important in deciding which are the phases of relevance in manganites .",
    "these calculations are also discussed in detail below .",
    "finally , it is reassuring for the success of manganite investigations that a variety of experiments , reviewed here , appear to be in qualitatively good agreement with the most recent theoretical calculations .",
    "even quantitative agreement is slowly starting to emerge , although there are still many aspects of the problem that require further investigation . at a more general level , from this review it is expected that the readers will understand the richness of manganite physics and how it challenges aspects of our present understanding of condensed matter systems .",
    "the effort to fully unveil the behavior of electrons in manganites should continue at its current fast pace in the near future .",
    "the field of manganites started with the seminal paper of jonker and van santen ( 1950 ) where the existence of ferromagnetism in mixed crystals of @xmath1-@xmath2 , @xmath1-@xmath3 , and @xmath1-@xmath4 was reported .",
    "the general chemical formula for the manganese oxides described in jonker and van santen s paper ( 1950 ) , and many other compounds investigated later on , is @xmath5 , with t a trivalent rare earth or bi@xmath6 cation , and d a divalent alkaline or pb@xmath7 cation .",
    "oxygen is in a o@xmath8 state , and the relative fraction of mn@xmath9 and mn@xmath6 is regulated by `` x '' .",
    "the perovskite lattice structure of these materials is illustrated in fig.i.1a .",
    "jonker and van santen ( 1950 ) adopted the terminology `` manganites '' to refer to these mixed compounds , although it is not strictly correct , as they emphasized in a footnote , since the term manganite should in principle apply only to the 100% @xmath10 compound .",
    "more detailed information about @xmath11 using neutron scattering techniques was obtained later by wollan and koehler ( 1955 ) . in their study",
    "the antiferromagnetic ( af or afm ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) phases were characterized , and the former was found to contain nontrivial arrangements of charge at particular hole densities .",
    "wollan and koehler ( 1955 ) noticed the mixture of c - type and e - type magnetic unit cells in the structure at x=0.5 , and labeled the insulating state at this density as a `` ce - state '' ( the seven possible arrangements a , b , c , d , e , f , and g for the spin in the unit - cell are shown in fig.i.1b , with the spins of relevance being those located in the manganese ions ) .",
    "theoretical work at approximately the same time , to be reviewed below , explained the ferromagnetic phase as caused by an effect called `` double - exchange '' ( de ) , and thus one of the most interesting properties of these materials appeared to have found a good rationalization in the early studies of these compounds .",
    "perhaps as a consequence of the apparent initial theoretical success , studies of the manganites continued in subsequent years at a slow pace .",
    "the renewed surge of interest in manganites in the 1990 s started with the experimental observation of large magnetoresistance ( mr ) effects in @xmath12 by kusters et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and in @xmath13 by von helmolt et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ( actually searle and wang ( 1967 ) were the first to report mr studies in manganites , which were carried out using @xmath14 single crystals ) .",
    "resistivity vs. temperature results for the ( la , ba ) compound are shown in fig.i.2a , reproduced from von helmolt et al .",
    "the mr effect was found to be as high as 60% at room temperature using thin - films , and it was exciting to observe that this value was higher than found in artificial magnetic / nonmagnetic multilayers , allowing for potential applications in magnetic recording .",
    "however , as discussed extensively below , while a large body of subsequent experimental work has shown that the mr factor can actually be made very close to 100% ( for a definition of the mr ratio see below ) , this occurs unfortunately at the cost of reducing the curie temperature @xmath15 , which jeopardizes those possible technological applications .",
    "consider for instance in fig.i.2b the results for @xmath12 reproduced from kusters et al .",
    "( 1989 ) . in this case",
    "the change in resistivity is larger than for the ( la , ba ) compound , however its curie temperature is reduced to 184k . also complicating possible applications",
    ", it is known that giant mr multilayer structures present their appreciable changes in resistivity with fields as small as 0.01 tesla ( helman and abeles , 1976 ; fert and campbell , 1976 ) , while manganites typically need larger fields of about 1 tesla or more for equivalent resistivity changes , which appear too large for potential use in magnetic recording .",
    "although progress in the development of applications is frequently reported ( for recent references see chen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , venimadhav et al . (",
    "2000 ) , kida and tomouchi ( 2000b ) ) , in this review the manganites will be mainly considered as an interesting basic - physics problem , with emphasis focused on understanding the microscopic origin of the large mr effect which challenges our current knowledge of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "the discussion of possible applications of manganites is left for future reviews .",
    "the big boost to the field of manganites that led to the present explosion of interest in the subject was produced by the discovery of the so - called `` colossal '' magnetoresistance ( cmr ) effect . in studies of thin films of @xmath16 , a mr effect three orders of magnitude larger than the typical",
    "`` giant '' mr of superlattice films was observed ( the name colossal was coined mainly to distinguish the effect from this previously found giant mr effect ) . defining the mr ratio as @xmath17=@xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the resistances without and with a magnetic field @xmath21 , respectively , and expressing the result as a percentage ( i.e. , multiplying by an additional factor 100 ) it has been shown that mr ratios as large as 127,000% near 77k can be obtained ( jin et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "this corresponds to more than a thousand - fold change in resistivity .",
    "alternatively , expressed in terms of @xmath22=@xmath23 the mr ratio in this case is as large as 99.92% .",
    "xiong et al .",
    "( 1995 ) reported thin - films studies of @xmath24 and in this case @xmath17 was as high as @xmath25% , a truly colossal factor .",
    "triggered by such huge numbers , the experimental and theoretical study of manganites reignited , and is presently carried out by dozens of groups around the world .",
    "early work tended to focus on the x=0.3 doping due to its large @xmath15 .",
    "however , more recently the attention has shifted towards other densities such as x@xmath260.2 or x@xmath270.5 , where the competition between the various states of manganites can be better analyzed . in fact , one of the main results of recent investigations is that in order to understand the cmr effect , knowledge of the ferromagnetic metallic phase is not sufficient .",
    "the competing phases must be understood as well .",
    "this issue will be discussed extensively below .",
    "previous reviews on manganites are already available , but they have mainly focused on experiments .",
    "for instance , the reader can consult the reviews of ramirez ( 1997 ) , coey , viret , and von molnar ( 1998 ) , as well as the books recently edited by rao and raveau ( 1998 ) , kaplan and mahanti ( 1999 ) and tokura ( 1999 ) .",
    "see also loktev and pogorelov ( 2000 ) .",
    "the present review differs from previous ones in several aspects : ( i ) it addresses theoretical work in detail , especially regarding the stabilization in a variety of calculations of the many nontrivial charge / spin / orbital phases found in experiments ; ( ii ) it highlights the importance of _ phase separation _ tendencies in models for manganites and the potential considerable influence of disorder on transitions that would be first - order in the clean limit , leading to percolative processes ; and ( iii ) it emphasizes the experimental results that have recently reported the presence of intrinsic inhomogeneities in manganites , results that appear in excellent agreement with the theoretical developments .",
    "if the review could be summarized in just a few words , the overall conclusion would be that theoretical and experimental work is rapidly converging to a unified picture pointing toward a physics of manganites in the cmr regimes clearly dominated by @xmath28 in the form of coexisting competing phases .",
    "this is an @xmath29 feature of single crystals , unrelated to grain boundary effects of polycrystals , and its theoretical understanding and experimental control is a challenge that should be strongly pursued .",
    "in fact , in spite of the considerably progress in recent years reviewed here , it is clear that the analysis of mixed - phase systems is at its early stages , and considerable more work should be devoted to the detailed study of manganese oxides and related compounds in such a regime .    in this review , it is assumed that the reader is familiar with some basic phenomenology involving the @xmath30-orbitals of relevance in manganese oxides . in the cubic lattice environment ,",
    "the five - fold degenerate @xmath31-orbitals of an isolated atom or ion are split into a manifold of three lower energy levels ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ) , usually referred to as `` @xmath35 '' , and two higher energy states ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) called `` @xmath38 '' . the valence of the mn - ions in this context is either four ( mn@xmath6 ) or three ( mn@xmath9 ) , and their relative fraction is controlled through chemical doping .",
    "the large hund coupling favors the population of the @xmath35 levels with three electrons forming a spin 3/2 state , and the @xmath38 level either contains one electron or none .",
    "a sketch with these results is shown in fig.i.3 .",
    "the organization is the following . in section",
    "ii , the most basic properties of manganites will be reviewed from the experimental viewpoint .",
    "emphasis will be given to the phase diagrams and magnitude of the cmr effect in various manganites .",
    "for this section , the manganites will be divided into large , intermediate , and small bandwidth @xmath39 compounds , a slightly unorthodox classification since previous work simply labeled them as either large or small @xmath39 . in section iii ,",
    "the theoretical aspects are presented , starting with the early developments in the subject .",
    "models and approximations will be discussed in detail , and results will be described . especially , the key importance of the recently found phase separation tendencies will be remarked . in section iv ,",
    "the experimental work that have reported evidence of intrinsic inhomogeneities in manganites compatible with the theoretical calculations will be reviewed .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in section v including the problems still open .",
    "* ii.a large - bandwidth manganites : + the case of @xmath40 *    in the renaissance of the study of manganites during the 90 s , a considerable emphasis has been given to the analysis of @xmath41 , a material considered to be representative of the `` large '' bandwidth subset of manganese oxides .",
    "it is believed that in this compound the hopping amplitude for electrons in the @xmath38-band is larger than in other manganites , as a consequence of the sizes of the ions involved in the chemical composition , as discussed below .",
    "its curie temperature @xmath15 as a function of hole doping is relatively high , increasing its chances for future practical applications .",
    "it has also been found that @xmath41 presents a complex behavior in the vicinity of x=1/8 ( see below ) , with a potential phenomenology as rich as found in the low - bandwidth manganites described later in this section .",
    "resistivities vs. temperature for this compound at several densities are shown in fig.ii.a.1a ( taken from urushibara et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ) . from these transport measurements ,",
    "the phase diagram of this compound can be determined and it is shown in fig.ii.a.1b ( y. tokura and y. tomioka , prepared with data from urushibara et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and fujishiro et al .",
    "see also y. moritomo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ) . at hole concentrations such as x=0.4 ,",
    "the system is metallic ( defined straightforwardly as regions where @xmath42@xmath270 ) even above @xmath15 . at densities above x=0.5 an interesting a - type antiferromagnetic metallic state",
    "is stabilized , with ferromagnetism in planes and antiferromagnetism between those planes .",
    "this phase was actually first observed in another compound @xmath43 ( kawano et al . , 1997 ) and is believed to have @xmath36-type uniform orbital order within the ferromagnetic planes ( for a visual representation of this state see fig.4 of kajimoto et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "considering now lower hole densities , at concentrations slightly below x=0.30 the state above @xmath15 becomes an insulator , which is an unexpected property of a paramagnetic state that transforms into a metal upon reducing the temperature .",
    "this curious effect is present in all the intermediate and low bandwidth manganites , and it is a key property of this family of compounds . at densities x@xmath440.17 ,",
    "an insulating state is found even at low temperatures . as reviewed in more detail below , currently considerable work in the context of @xmath41",
    "is being focused on the x@xmath450.12 region , simply labeled `` ferromagnetic insulator '' in fig.ii.a.1b . in this region , indications of charge - ordering have been found even in this putative large - bandwidth material , establishing an interesting connection with intermediate and low bandwidth manganites where charge - ordering tendencies are very prominent .",
    "a revised phase diagram of @xmath41 will be presented later when the experimental evidence of inhomogeneous states in this compound is discussed .",
    "studies by tokura et al .",
    "( 1994 ) showed that the mr effect is maximized in the density region separating the insulating from metallic states at low temperature , namely x=0.175 .",
    "the mr effect here is shown in fig.ii.a.2a , taken from tokura et al .",
    "the curie temperature is still substantially large in this regime , which makes it attractive from the viewpoint of potential applications .",
    "a very important qualitative aspect of the results shown in fig.ii.a.2a is that the mr effect is maximized at the smallest @xmath15 which leads to a metallic ferromagnetic state ; this observation let the authors to conclude that the large mr regime can only be clearly understood when the various effects which are in competition with de are considered .",
    "this point will be a recurrent conclusion emerging from the theoretical calculations reviewed below , namely in order to achieve a large mr effect the insulating phase is at least as important as the metallic phase , and the region of the most interest should be the @xmath46 between the metal and the insulator ( moreo , yunoki and dagotto , 1999a ; moreo et al .",
    "these insulating properties occur at low temperature by changing the density , or , at fixed density , by increasing the temperature , at least in some density windows .",
    "it is at the metal - insulator boundary where the tendencies to form coexisting clusters and percolative transitions are the most important .",
    "this point of view is qualitatively different from the approach followed in previous theories based on polaronic formation , anderson localization , or on modifications of the double - exchange ideas , but it is crucial in the phase - separation based approaches described here .",
    "note , however , that the metallic phase of @xmath41 at sufficiently large hole density seems quite properly described by double - exchange approaches , namely there is a simple relation between the resistivity and the magnetization in the metallic ferromagnetic phase ( tokura et al . , 1994 ; furukawa , 1998 ) .",
    "then , it is important to distinguish the theoretical understanding of the individual phases , far from others in parameter space , from the understanding of the @xmath47 among them .",
    "it is the latest issue that is the most important for the explanation of the mr effect according to recent calculations ( moreo , yunoki , and dagotto , 1999a ; moreo et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "it is also interesting to point out that the low temperature ferromagnetic metallic state that appears prominently in fig.ii.a.1b is actually `` unconventional '' in many respects .",
    "for instance , in fig.ii.a.2b , taken from tokura ( 1999 ) , it is shown that the total low energy spectral weight of the optical conductivity @xmath48 is still changing even in the low temperature region , where the spin is already almost fully polarized .",
    "clearly there is another scattering mechanism in the system besides the spin .",
    "actually , even within the fm - state the carrier motion is mostly incoherent since the drude weight is only 1/5 of the total low - energy weight . the conventional drude model is not applicable to the fm - state of manganites .",
    "probably the orbital degrees of freedom are important to account for this effect .",
    "* ii.b intermediate - bandwidth manganites : + the case of @xmath49 *    currently , a large fraction of the work in manganites focuses on intermediate to low bandwidth materials since these are the ones that present the largest cmr effects , which are associated with the presence of charge ordering tendencies . unfortunately ,",
    "as discussed in the introduction , this comes at a price : the curie temperature decreases as the magnitude of the mr effects increases . in this section",
    ", the properties of @xmath11 will be discussed in detail .",
    "this compound presents some characteristics of large bandwidth manganites , such as the presence of a robust ferromagnetic phase .",
    "however , it also has features that indicate strong deviations from double - exchange behavior , including the existence of charge / orbital - ordered phases . for this reason",
    ", the authors consider that this compound should be labeled as of `` intermediate bandwidth '' , to distinguish it from the truly low bandwidth compound @xmath50 where a metallic ferromagnetic phase can only be stabilized by the application of magnetic fields .",
    "@xmath11 has been analyzed since the early days of manganite studies ( jonker and van santen , 1950 ; wollan and koehler , 1955 ; matsumoto , 1970b ) , but it is only recently that it has been systematically scrutinized as a function of density and temperature . in particular , it has been observed that @xmath11 has a large mr effect .",
    "for example , fig.ii.b.1 reproduces results from schiffer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) at x=0.25 showing the magnetization and resistivity as a function of temperature , and the existence of a robust mr , larger than 80% .",
    "the drop in @xmath51 with decreasing temperature and the peak in mr are correlated with the ferromagnetic transition in the magnetization .",
    "the insulating behavior above the curie temperature is very prominent and the explanation of its origin is among the most important issues to be addressed in theories of manganites , as already discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "below @xmath15 the presence of ferromagnetism was tentatively attributed to the double exchange mechanism , but further work reviewed in sec .",
    "iv has actually revealed a far more complex structure with coexisting phases even in this metallic regime .",
    "in fact , hints of this behavior may already be present in fig.ii.b.1 which already reveals a mr effect as large as 30% well below @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , it is also interesting to observe that hydrostatic pressure leads to large changes in resistivity comparable to those found using magnetic fields [ see for instance fig.ii.b.2 where @xmath51 is shown parametric with pressure at x=0.21 , taken from neumeier et al .",
    "see also hwang et al .",
    "( 1995b ) ] .",
    "the qualitative features of fig.ii.b.1 contribute to the understanding , at least in part , of the cmr effect found in thin - films of this same compound ( jin et al .",
    "for references on thin film work in manganites , see ramirez , 1997 , page 8182 .",
    "see also kanki , tanaka and kawai , 2000 ) . in the work of jin et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , @xmath15 was suppressed by substrate - induced strain , and , as a consequence , the @xmath52 was much higher immediately above the transition than in crystals since the system was still in the insulating state , inducing an enormous change in resistivity .",
    "thus , it appears that to understand the large mr values the insulating state is actually @xmath53 important than the metallic state , and the relevance of the de ideas is limited to the partial explanation of the low temperature phase in a narrow density window , as explained in more detail later . clearly the de framework is insufficient for describing the physics of the manganites .",
    "the complete phase diagram of @xmath11 , based on magnetization and resistivity measurements , is reproduced in fig.ii.b.3 , taken from cheong and hwang ( 1999 ) .",
    "note that the fm phase actually occupies just a fraction of the whole diagram , illustrating once again that de does not provide a full understanding of the manganites .",
    "for instance , equally prominent are the charge ordered ( co ) states between x=0.50 and 0.87 .",
    "the co state at x=0.50 was already described by wollan and koehler ( 1955 ) as a ce - state , and the characteristics at other densities are discussed below . in the regime of co - states , studies by ramirez et al .",
    "( 1996 ) of the sound velocity , specific heat , and electron diffraction were attributed to strong electron - phonon coupling , in agreement with the predictions of millis , shraiman and littlewood ( 1995 ) .",
    "the `` canted '' state at x close to 1 could be a mixed - phase state with coexisting fm - af characteristics based on recent theoretical calculations ( see below sec.iii ) , but the issue is still under discussion .",
    "the low hole - density regime is quite unusual and nontrivial , and it appears to involve a charge - ordered phase , and a curious ferromagnetic insulator . actually at x=0.10 , there is no large mr effect using fields of 12 t , according to fig .",
    "6 of ibarra and de teresa ( 1998c ) .",
    "figure 25 of the same reference shows that at x=0.65 , well inside the charge - ordered state , a 12 t field is also not sufficient to destabilize the insulating state into a metallic one .",
    "thus , to search for a large mr effect , the density must be closer to that leading to the fm metallic regime , as emphasized before .    in fig.ii.b.3 note also the presence of well - defined features at commensurate carrier concentrations x=@xmath54/8 ( @xmath54=1,3,4,5 and 7 ) .",
    "the curie temperature is maximized at x=3/8 according to cheong and hwang ( 1999 ) , contrary to the x=0.30 believed by many to be the most optimal density for ferromagnetism .",
    "cheong and hwang ( 1999 ) also remarked that in the large - bandwidth compound @xmath41 , @xmath15 is also maximized at the same x=3/8 concentration , implying that this phenomenon is universal .",
    "it is important to realize that within a simple one - orbital double - exchange model , as described later , the optimal density for ferromagnetism should be x=0.50 .",
    "the fact that this is not observed is already indicative of the problems faced by a double - exchange description of manganites .",
    "note also that zhao et al .",
    "( 1996,1999 ) found a giant oxygen isotope shift in @xmath15 of about 20k at x=0.2 , showing the relevance of electron - phonon couplings in manganites , a recurrent result of many papers in this context .",
    "the charge - ordering temperature @xmath55 peaks at x=5/8 ( the same occurs in ( bi , ca)-based compounds ) , while at x=4/8=1/2 there is a sharp change from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic ground states .",
    "the whole phase diagram has a pronounced electron - hole @xmath56 , showing again that simple double - exchange models with only one orbital are not realistic . at x=1/8 the low density charge - ordered state appears to have the largest strength , while on the other side at x=7/8 charge ordering disappears into a mixed fm - af state .",
    "finally , at x=0 the ground state is an a - type antiferromagnet ( see also matsumoto , 1970a ) with ferromagnetic spin correlations on a plane and antiferromagnetism between planes , while at x=1 it is a g - type antiferromagnet ( af in all directions ) , both of them insulating .",
    "the pattern of charge- and orbital - order in the co states of fig.ii.b.3 is highly nontrivial and at several densities still under discussion ( for early work in the context of orbital ordering see kugel and khomskii ( 1974 ) , and eremin and kalinenkov ( 1978 and 1981 ) ) .",
    "some of the arrangements that have been identified are those shown in fig.ii.b.4 , reproduced from hwang and cheong ( 1999 ) . at x=0 ,",
    "the a - type spin state is orbitally - ordered as it appears in fig.ii.b.4a . at x=0.5",
    "the famous ce - type arrangement ( fig.ii.b.4b ) already found in early studies of manganites is certainly stabilized .",
    "this state has been recently observed experimentally using resonant x - ray scattering ( zimmermann et al .",
    "see also zimmermann et al . , 2000 ) . at x=2/3 , and also x=3/4 ,",
    "a novel `` bi - stripe '' arrangement is found ( mori , chen , and cheong , 1998a ) .",
    "the x=0.65 state is very stable upon the application of a magnetic field ( fig.25 of ibarra and de teresa , 1998c ) .",
    "the origin of the term bi - stripe is obvious from fig.ii.b.4c .",
    "however , theoretical work ( hotta et al . , 2000 and references therein )",
    "has shown that it is more appropriate to visualize this arrangement as formed by fm zigzag chains running in the direction @xmath57 to those of the charge stripes of fig.ii.b.4c .",
    "this issue will be discussed in more detail later in the review when the theoretical aspects are addressed .",
    "based on electron microscopy techniques hwang and cheong ( 1999 ) believe that at the , e.g. , x=5/8 concentration a mixture of the x=1/2 and x=2/3 configurations forms the ground state .",
    "the size of the coexisting clusters is approximately 100  .",
    "once again , it appears that phase separation tendencies are at work in manganese oxides .",
    "however , note that studies by radaelli et al .",
    "( 1999 ) on the x=2/3 compound arrived to the conclusion that a `` wigner crystal '' charge arrangement is stable at this density , with the charge ordered but spread as far from each other as possible .",
    "it appears that bi - stripes and wigner crystal states must be very close in energy . while the results at x=0.0 and 0.5 have been reproduced in recent theoretical studies of manganite models , the more complex arrangements at other densities",
    "are still under analysis ( hotta et al . , 2000 ) and will be discussed in more detail below .    finally , there is an interesting observation that is related with some theoretical developments to be presented later in the review . in fig.ii.b.5 , the resistivity at 300k and 100k vs. hole density is shown , reproduced from cheong and hwang ( 1999 ) .",
    "note at 300k the smooth behavior as x grows from 0 , only interrupted close to x=1 when the g - type af insulating state is reached .",
    "then , at 300k there is no @xmath58 of the drastically different physics found at , e.g. , 100k where for x@xmath260.5 a fm - state is found while for x@xmath270.5 the state is co and af .",
    "this lack of precursors is also in agreement with neutron scattering results that reported fm fluctuations above the co and nel temperatures in the large x regime ( dai et al . , 1996 ) , similar to those observed at lower hole densities .",
    "these results are consistent with an @xmath59 first - order - like transition from the state with fm fluctuations to the co / af - state , as observed in other experiments detailed in later sections ( for very recent work see ramos et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "these two states are so different that a smooth transition between them is not possible . in addition , recent theoretical developments assign considerable importance to the influence of disorder on this type of first - order transitions to explain the large mr effect in manganites ( moreo et al . , 2000 ) , as shown elsewhere in this review .",
    "then , the sudden character of the transition from ferromagnetism to charge - ordered antiferromagnetism appears to play a @xmath60 role in the physics of manganites , and its importance is emphasized in many places in the text that follows .",
    "* ii.c low - bandwidth manganites : + the case of @xmath61 *    as explained before , in perovskite manganites , such as @xmath11 and the compound @xmath50 described here , the bandwidth @xmath39 is smaller than in other compounds that have a behavior more in line with the standard double - exchange ideas . in the low bandwidth compounds ,",

    "however , certainly the hole density is changing with x , and as a consequence the ce - state can not be `` perfect '' at all densities but electrons have to be added or removed from the structure .",
    "jirak et al.(1985 ) discussed a `` pseudo''-ce - type structure for x=0.4 that has the proper density .",
    "other authors simply refer to the x@xmath650.5 co - states as made out of the x=0.5 structure plus `` defects '' .",
    "hotta and dagotto ( 2000 ) proposed an ordered state for x=3/8 based on mean - field and numerical approximations .",

    "a compound that behaves similarly to @xmath43 is @xmath68 , with the exception of x=0.5 : in @xmath68(x=0.5 ) the co - state is not stable . actually , tokura clarified to the authors ( private communication ) that the polycrystal results that appeared in tomioka et al .",
    "( 1995 ) showing a co - phase in this compound were later proven incorrect after the preparation of single crystals .",
    "nevertheless such a result illustrates the fragile stability of the co - phase in materials where the bandwidth is not sufficiently small .",
    "results for this compound reporting mixed - phase tendencies were recently presented by zvyagin et al .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram for a mixture @xmath69 can be found in akimoto et al .",

    "the phase diagram of @xmath70 investigated by moritomo ( 1999 ) also shows a competition between fm and co , with phase separation characteristics in between .",
    "other manganites present co - phases at x=0.5 as well , and the compound where this phase seems to be the strongest is @xmath71 , as exemplified in fig.ii.d.2 , where the effect of magnetic fields on several low - bandwidth manganites is shown .",
    "an interesting way to visualize the relative tendencies of manganite compounds to form a co - state at x=0.5 can be found in fig.ii.d.3 , taken from tomioka and tokura ( 1999 ) . as discussed in more detail at the end of this section ,",
    "the key ingredient determining the fm vs co character of a state at a fixed density is the size of the ions involved in the chemical composition . in fig.ii.d.3 the radius of the trivalent and divalent ions , as well as their average radius at x=0.5 ,",
    "appear in the horizontal axes .",
    "the curie and co temperature are shown below in part ( b ) .",
    "as an example , for the extreme case of ( la , sr ) based manganites , a metallic ferromagnetic state is observed at x=0.5 , while ( pr , ca ) compounds are charge - ordered . as a byproduct of fig.ii.d.2",
    ", it is quite interesting to note the similarities between the actual values of the critical temperatures @xmath15 and @xmath55 .",
    "being two rather different states , there is no obvious reason why their critical temperatures are similar .",
    "a successful theory must certainly address this curious fact .",

    "in fact , moritomo et al . ( 1996 ) showed that it is possible to prepare double - layer compounds with a composition @xmath72 .",
    "single - layer manganites can also be synthesized , as will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "in fact these are just special cases of the ruddlesden - popper series @xmath73 , with t a trivalent cation , d a divalent cation , and n=1 corresponding to the single layer , n=2 to the double layer , and n=@xmath74 to the cubic perovskite structure ( see fig.ii.e.1 for the actual structure ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity in representative multilayer structures is shown in fig.ii.e.2 for the n=1 , n=2 , and n=@xmath74 ( 3d perovskite ) compounds at a hole concentration of x=0.4 . in the regime where the single - layer is insulating and the n=@xmath74 layer is metallic ,",
    "the double - layer has an intermediate behavior , with insulating properties above a critical temperature and metallic below .",
    "a large mr effect is observed in this double - layer system as shown in fig.ii.e.3 , larger than the one found for @xmath41 .",
    "the full phase diagram of this compound will be discussed later in this review ( section iv ) in connection with the presence of inhomogeneities and clustering tendencies .",
    "* ii.f single - layer compound *    as mentioned in the previous subsection , the single - layer manganite has also been synthesized ( see rao et al . , 1988 ) .",
    "its chemical formula is @xmath75 .",
    "this compound does not have a ferromagnetic phase in the range from x=0.0 to x=0.7 , which is curious .",
    "note that other manganites have not presented a ferromagnetic metallic phase also , but they had at least a ferro - insulating regime ( e.g. , @xmath50 ) . a schematic phase diagram of the one - layer compound is given in fig.ii.f.1 , reproduced from moritomo et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . at all the densities shown",
    ", insulating behavior has been found .",
    "note the prominent co - phase near x=0.5 , and especially the `` spin - glass '' phase in a wide range of densities between x=0.2 and x@xmath450.5 .",
    "the x=0.5 charge - ordered phase is of the ce - type ( sternlieb et al . , 1996 ; y. murakami et al . , 1998 )",
    "the large x regime has phase separation according to bao et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , as discussed in more detail below .",
    "the actual microscopic arrangement of charge and spin in the intermediate spin - glass regime has not been experimentally studied in detail , to the best of our knowledge , but it certainly deserves more attention since the two - dimensionality of the system makes possible reliable theoretical studies and simulations .    *",
    "ii.g importance of tolerance factor *    it has been clearly shown experimentally that working at a fixed hole density the properties of manganites strongly depend on a geometrical quantity called the `` tolerance factor '' , defined as @xmath76=@xmath77 . here",
    "@xmath78 is the distance between the a site , where the trivalent or divalent non - mn ions are located , to the nearest oxygen .",
    "remember that the a ion is at the center of a cube with mn in the vertices and o in between the mn s .",
    "@xmath79 is the mn - o shortest distance . since for an undistorted cube with a straight mn - o - mn link , @xmath78=@xmath80 and @xmath79=1 in units of the mn - o distance , then @xmath76=1 in this perfect system",
    "however , sometimes the a ions are too small to fill the space in the cube centers and for this reason the oxygens tend to move toward that center , reducing @xmath78",
    ". in general @xmath79 also changes at the same time . for these reasons , the tolerance factor becomes less than unity , @xmath76@xmath261 , as the a radius is reduced , and the mn - o - mn angle @xmath81 becomes smaller than 180@xmath82 .",
    "the hopping amplitude for carriers to move from mn to mn naturally decreases as @xmath81 becomes smaller than 180@xmath82 ( remember that for a 90@xmath82 bond the hopping involving a @xmath83-orbital at the oxygen simply cancels , as explained in more detail below ) . as a consequence , as the tolerance factor decreases , the tendencies to charge localization increase due to the reduction in the mobility of the carriers . since in the general chemical composition for perovskite manganites",
    "@xmath84 there are two possible ions at the `` a '' site , then the tolerance factor for a given compound can be defined as a density - weighted average of the individual tolerance factors . in fig.ii.d.3",
    "the reader can find some of the ionic radius in @xmath85 , for some of the most important elements in the manganite composition .",
    "note that the distance mn - mn is actually reduced in the situation described so far ( @xmath76@xmath261 ) , while the tolerance factor ( monotonically related with the hopping amplitude ) is also reduced , which is somewhat counterintuitive since it would be expected that having closer mn - ions would increase the electron hopping between them .",
    "however , the hopping amplitude is not only proportional to @xmath86 , where @xmath87@xmath271 ( see harrison , 1989 ) but also to @xmath88 due to the fact that it is the @xmath83-orbital of oxygen that is involved in the process and if this orbital points toward one of the manganese ions , it can not point toward the other one simultaneously for @xmath81@xmath65180@xmath82 .",
    "hwang et al . ( 1995a ) carried out a detailed study of the @xmath89 compound for a variety of a and a@xmath90 ions .",
    "figure ii.g.1a summarizes this effort , and it shows the presence of three dominant regimes : a paramagnetic insulator at high temperature , a low temperature ferromagnetic metal at large tolerance factor , and a low temperature charge - ordered ferromagnetic - insulator at small tolerance factor .",
    "this figure clearly illustrates the drastic dependence with the tolerance factor of the properties of doped manganites .",
    "these same results will be discussed in more detail below in this review , when issues related with the presence of coexisting phases are addressed . in particular ,",
    "experimental work have shown that the `` fmi '' regime may actually correspond to coexisting co and fm large clusters .",
    "the co phase has both charge and orbital order .",
    "an example upon which fig.ii.g.1a has been constructed is shown in fig.ii.g.1b that mainly corresponds to results obtained for @xmath91 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath51 presents hysteresis effects , suggesting that the pmi - fmm transition has some @xmath92 order characteristics , a feature that is of crucial importance in recent theoretical developments to be discussed later ( yunoki , hotta , dagotto , 2000 ; moreo et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "note the huge mr ratios found in these compounds and the general trend that this ratio dramatically increases as @xmath15 is reduced , mainly as a consequence of the rapid increase of the resistivity of the pm insulating state as the temperature is reduced .",
    "certainly the state above @xmath15 is not a simple metal where ferromagnetic correlations slowly build up with decreasing temperature as in a second order transition , and as expected in the de mechanism .",
    "a new theory is needed to explain these results .",
    "* iii.a early studies *    * double exchange : *    most of the early theoretical work on manganites focused on the qualitative aspects of the experimentally discovered relation between transport and magnetic properties , namely the increase in conductivity upon the polarization of the spins .",
    "not much work was devoted to the magnitude of the magnetoresistance effect itself .",
    "the formation of coexisting clusters of competing phases was not included in the early considerations .",
    "the states of manganites were assumed to be uniform , and `` double exchange '' ( de ) was proposed by zener ( 1951b ) as a way to allow for charge to move in manganites by the generation of a spin polarized state .",
    "the de process has been historically explained in two somewhat different ways .",
    "originally , zener ( 1951b ) considered the explicit movement of electrons schematically written ( cieplak , 1973 ) as @xmath93@xmath94@xmath10 @xmath95 @xmath10@xmath96@xmath97 where 1 , 2 , and 3 label electrons that belong either to the oxygen between manganese , or to the @xmath38-level of the mn - ions . in this process",
    "there are two @xmath98 motions ( thus the name double - exchange ) involving electron 2 moving from the oxygen to the right mn - ion , and electron 1 from the left mn - ion to the oxygen ( see fig.iii.a.1a ) .",
    "the second way to visualize de processes was presented in detail by anderson and hasegawa ( 1955 ) and it involves a second - order process in which the two states described above go from one to the other using an intermediate state @xmath93@xmath99 @xmath97 . in this context",
    "the effective hopping for the electron to move from one mn - site to the next is proportional to the square of the hopping involving the @xmath83-oxygen and @xmath30-manganese orbitals ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "in addition , if the localized spins are considered classical and with an angle @xmath81 between nearest - neighbor ones , the effective hopping becomes proportional to @xmath101 , as shown by anderson and hasegawa ( 1955 ) . if @xmath81=0 the hopping is the largest , while if @xmath81=@xmath102 , corresponding to an antiferromagnetic background , then the hopping cancels .",
    "the quantum version of this process has been described by kubo and ohata ( 1972 ) .",
    "note that the oxygen linking the mn - ions is crucial to understand the origin of the word `` double '' in this process .",
    "nevertheless , the majority of the theoretical work carried out in the context of manganites simply forgets the presence of the oxygen and uses a manganese - only hamiltonian .",
    "it is interesting to observe that ferromagnetic states appear in this context even @xmath103 the oxygen .",
    "it is clear that the electrons simply need a polarized background to improve their kinetic energy , in similar ways as the nagaoka phase is generated in the one - band hubbard model at large @xmath104 ( for a high-@xmath105 review , see dagotto , 1994 ) .",
    "this tendency to optimize the kinetic energy is at work in a variety of models and the term double - exchange appears unnecessary .",
    "however , in spite of this fact it has become customary to refer to virtually any ferromagnetic phase found in manganese models as `` de induced '' or `` de generated '' , forgetting the historical origin of the term . in this review a similar convention will be followed , namely the credit for the appearance of fm phases will be given to the de mechanism , although a more general and simple kinetic - energy optimization is certainly at work .",
    "* ferromagnetism due to a large hund coupling : *    regarding the stabilization of ferromagnetism , computer simulations ( yunoki et al .",
    ", 1998a ) and a variety of other approximations have clearly shown that models @xmath103 the oxygen degrees of freedom ( to be reviewed below ) can also produce fm phases , as long as the hund coupling is large enough .",
    "in this situation , when the @xmath38 electrons directly jump from mn to mn their kinetic energy is minimized if all spins are aligned ( see fig.iii.a.1b ) .",
    "as explained in the previous subsection , this procedure to obtain ferromagnetism is usually also called double - exchange and even the models from where it emerges are called double - exchange models . however , there is little resemble of these models and physical process with the original de ideas ( zener , 1951b ) where two electrons were involved in the actual hopping .",
    "actually the fm phases recently generated in computer simulations and a variety of mean - field approximations resemble more closely the predictions of another work of zener ( 1951a ) , where indeed a large hund coupling is invoked as the main reason for ferromagnetism in some compounds .",
    "in addition , it has been questioned whether double - exchange or the large @xmath106 mechanism are sufficient to indeed produce the ferromagnetic phase of manganites .",
    "an alternative idea ( zhao , 2000 ) relies on the fact that holes are located mostly in the oxygens due to the charge - transfer character of manganites and these holes are linked antiferromagnetically with the spins in the adjacent mn ions due to the standard exchange coupling , leading to an effective mn - mn ferromagnetic interaction . in this context",
    "the movement of holes would be improved if all mn spins are aligned leading to a fm phase , although many - body calculations are needed to prove that this is indeed the case for realistic couplings .",
    "a comment about this idea : in the context of the cuprates a similar concept was discussed time ago ( for references see dagotto , 1994 ) and after considerable discussion it was concluded that this process has to be contrasted against the so - called zhang - rice singlet formation where the spin of the hole at the oxygen couples in a singlet state with the spin at the cu . as explained in riera , hallberg and dagotto ( 1997 ) the analogous process in manganites would lead to the formation of effective @xmath107=3/2 `` hole '' states , between the @xmath107=2 of manganese ( 3 + ) and the @xmath107=1/2 of the oxygen hole .",
    "thus , the competition between these two tendencies should be addressed in detail , similarly as done for the cuprates to clarify the proposal of zhao ( 2000 ) .",
    "* spin - canted state : *    at this point it is useful to discuss the well - known proposed `` spin canted '' state for manganites . work by de gennes ( 1960 ) using mean - field approximations suggested that the interpolation between the antiferromagnetic state of the undoped limit and the ferromagnetic state at finite hole density , where the de mechanism works , occurs through a `` canted state '' , similar as the state produced by a magnetic field acting over an antiferromagnet ( fig.iii.a.1c ) .",
    "in this state the spins develop a moment in one direction , while being mostly antiparallel within the plane perpendicular to that moment .",
    "the coexistence of fm and af features in several experiments carried out at low hole doping ( some of them reviewed below ) led to the widely spread belief until recently that this spin canted state was indeed found in real materials .",
    "however , a plethora of recent theoretical work ( also discussed below ) has shown that the canted state is actually @xmath62 realized in the model of manganites studied by de gennes ( i.e. , the simple one - orbital model ) .",
    "instead phase separation occurs between the af and fm states , as extensively reviewed below .",
    "nevertheless , a spin canted state is certainly still a possibility in real low - doped manganites but its origin , if their presence is confirmed , needs to be revised . it may occur that substantial dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions appear in manganese oxides , but the authors are not aware of experimental papers confirming or denying their relevance , although some estimations ( solovyev , hamada , and terakura , 1996 ; lyanda - geller et al . , 1999 , chun et al .",
    ", 1999a ) appear to indicate that the dm couplings are small .",
    "however , even if the dm coupling were large there are still subtle issues to be addressed .",
    "for instance , it is widely believed that dm interactions lead to canting .",
    "however , coffey , bedell and trugman ( 1990 ) showed that in the simple case where the @xmath108 factor for the dm interaction is a constant , as in most early work on the subject , the dm term leads to a spiral state rather than a truly canted state .",
    "in addition , the authors of this review are not aware of reliable calculations showing that a canted state can indeed be stabilized in a model without terms added that break explicitly the invariance under rotations of the system in such a way that a given direction , along which the moment develops , is made by hand different from the others .",
    "for all these reasons and from the discussion below it may appear that the simplest way to explain the experimental data at low doping is to assume an af - fm phase coexistence instead of a canted state .",
    "however , the issue is still open and more experimental work should be devoted to its clarification .",
    "* charge - ordered state at x=0.5 : *    early theoretical work on manganites carried out by goodenough ( 1955 ) explained many of the features observed in the neutron scattering @xmath11 experiments by wollan and koehler ( 1955 ) , notably the appearance of the a - type af phase at x=0 and the ce - type phase at x=0.5 .",
    "the approach of goodenough ( 1955 ) was based on the notion of `` semicovalent exchange '' and the main idea can be roughly explained as follows .",
    "suppose one considers a mn - o bond directed , say , along the @xmath109-axis , and let us assume that the mn - cation has an occupied orbital pointing along @xmath110 or @xmath111 instead of @xmath109 ( in other words , there is an empty orbital along @xmath109 ) .",
    "the oxygen , being in a ( 2@xmath112 ) state , will try to move towards this mn site since it does not have a negative cloud of mn electrons to fight against .",
    "this process shortens the distance mn - o and makes this bond quite stable .",
    "this is a semicovalent bond .",
    "suppose now the occupied mn orbital has an electron with an up spin .",
    "of the two relevant electrons of oxygen , the one with spin up will feel the exchange force toward the mn electron , i.e. , if both electrons involved have the same spin , the space part of their common wave function has nodes which reduce the electron - electron repulsion ( as in the hund s rules ) .",
    "then , effectively the considered mn - o bond becomes ferromagnetic between the mn electron and one of the oxygen electrons .",
    "consider now the left - side o - mn portion of the mn - o - mn bond .",
    "in the example under consideration , the second electron of oxygen must be down and it spends most of the time away from the left mn - ion ( rather than close to it as the oxygen spin - up electron does ) .",
    "if the mn - ion on the right of the link mn - o - mn also has an occupied orbital pointing perpendicular to the @xmath109-axis , then o - mn and mn - o behave similarly ( individually fm ) but with pairs of spins pointing in opposite directions .",
    "as a consequence an effective @xmath113 mn - mn interaction has been generated ( see fig.iii.a.2a ) , and both mn - o and o - mn are shorten in length .",
    "however , if the right mn has an electron in an orbital pointing along @xmath109 , namely along the relevant @xmath83-orbital of the oxygen , the hund - rule - like argument does not apply anymore since now a simple direct exchange is more important , leading to an af o - mn bond . in this case",
    ", the overall mn - mn interaction is @xmath114 , as sketched in fig.iii.a.2b .",
    "then , simple arguments lead to the notion that both af and fm couplings among the mn - ions can be effectively generated , depending on the orientation of the orbitals involved .    analyzing the various possibilities for the orbital directions and generalizing to the case where mn@xmath9 ions are also present",
    ", goodenough ( 1955 ) arrived to the a- and ce - type phases of manganites very early in the theoretical study of these compounds ( the shape of these states was shown in fig.ii.b.4 ) . in this line of reasoning , note that the coulomb interactions are important to generate hund - like rules and the oxygen is also important to produce the covalent bonds .",
    "the lattice distortions are also quite relevant in deciding which of the many possible states minimizes the energy .",
    "however , it is interesting to observe that in more recent theoretical work described below in this review , both the a- and ce - type phases can be generated @xmath103 the explicit appearance of oxygens in the models and also without including long - range coulombic terms .",
    "summarizing , there appears to be three mechanisms to produce effective fm interactions : ( i ) double exchange , where electrons are mobile , which is valid for non charge - ordered states and where the oxygen plays a key role , ( ii ) goodenough s approach where covalent bonds are important ( here the electrons do not have mobility in spite of the fm effective coupling ) , and it mainly applies to charge - ordered states , and ( iii ) the approach already described in this subsection based on purely mn models ( no oxygens ) which leads to fm interactions mainly as a consequence of the large hund coupling in the system .",
    "if phonons are introduced in the model it can be shown that the a - type and ce - type states are generated , as reviewed later in this section . in the remaining theoretical part of the review most of the emphasis will be given to approach ( iii ) to induce fm bonds since a large number of experimental results can be reproduced by this procedure , but it is important to keep in mind the historical path followed in the understanding of manganites .",
    "based on all this discussion , it is clear that reasonable proposals to understand the stabilization of af and fm phases in manganites have been around since the early theoretical studies of manganese oxides .",
    "however , these approaches ( double exchange , ferromagnetic covalent bonds , and large hund coupling ) are still @xmath62 sufficient to handle the very complex phase diagram of manganites . for instance",
    ", there are compounds such as @xmath41 that actually do not have the ce - phase at x=0.5 , while others do .",
    "there are compounds that are never metallic , while others have a paramagnetic state with standard metallic characteristics . and",
    "even more important , in the early studies of manganites there was no proper rationalization for the large mr effect .",
    "it is only with the use of state - of - the - art many - body tools that the large magnetotransport effects are starting to be understood , thanks to theoretical developments in recent years that can address the competition among the different phases of manganites , their clustering and mixed - phase tendencies , and dynamical jahn - teller polaron formation .",
    "* iii.b more recent theories *    the prevailing ideas to explain the curious magnetotransport behavior of manganites changed in the mid-90 s from the simple double - exchange scenario to a more elaborated picture where a large jahn - teller ( jt ) effect , which occurs in the mn@xmath6 ions , produces a strong electron - phonon coupling that persists even at densities where a ferromagnetic ground - state is observed .",
    "in fact , in the undoped limit x=0 , and even at finite but small x , it is well - known that a robust static structural distortion is present in the manganites ( see goodenough , 1955 , and elemans et al . , 1971 ) .",
    "in this context it is natural to imagine the existence of small lattice polarons in the paramagnetic phase above @xmath15 , and it was believed that these polarons lead to the insulating behavior of this regime .",
    "actually , the term polaron ( see holstein ( 1959 ) ) is somewhat ambiguous . in the context of manganites",
    "it is usually associated with a local distortion of the lattice around the charge , sometimes together with a magnetic cloud or region with ferromagnetic correlations ( magneto polaron or lattice - magneto polaron ) .    *",
    "double - exchange is not enough : *    the fact that double - exchange can not be enough to understand the physics of manganites is clear from several different points of view .",
    "for instance , millis , littlewood and shraiman ( 1995 ) arrived at this conclusion by presenting estimations of the critical curie temperature and of the resistivity using the de framework .",
    "regarding ferromagnetism , their calculations for a model having as an interaction only a large hund coupling between @xmath38 and @xmath35 electrons led to a @xmath15 prediction between 0.1ev and 0.3ev , namely of the order of the bare hopping amplitude and considerably higher than the experimental results .",
    "thus , it was argued that de produces the wrong @xmath15 by a large factor .",
    "however , note that computational work led to a much smaller estimation of the curie temperature of the order of 0.1@xmath115 for the double - exchange model ( @xmath115 is the @xmath38-electron hopping amplitude ) , and compatible with experiments ( yunoki et al .",
    ", 1998a ; calderon and brey , 1998 ; yi , hur and yu , 1999 ; motome and furukawa , 1999 ; motome and furukawa , 2000b ; some of which will be reviewed in more detail later .",
    "results for @xmath107=1/2 localized spins can be found in rder , singh , and zang , 1997 ) .",
    "for this reason arguments based on the value of @xmath15 are @xmath62 sufficient to exclude the double - exchange model . regarding the resistance , using the memory function method ( in principle valid at large frequency ) to estimate the dc component , millis , littlewood and shraiman ( 1995 ) found a resistivity that grows with reducing temperature ( insulating behavior ) even below @xmath15 .",
    "for this reason millis , littlewood and shraiman ( 1995 ) concluded that the model based only on a large @xmath106 is not adequate for the manganites , and instead the relevance of the jahn - teller phonons was invoked .",
    "these results have to be contrasted with computer - based calculations of the resistivity for the one - orbital model at @xmath106=@xmath74 by calderon , vergs and brey ( 1999 ) that reported instead a metallic behavior for the double - exchange model , actually both above and below @xmath15 .",
    "paradoxically , this behavior also leads to the same conclusion , namely that double - exchange is not sufficient to explain the manganite behavior of , e.g. , @xmath11 which has insulating characteristics above @xmath15 but it is metallic below .",
    "however , both lines of attack to the de model may need further revision , since the computational work of yunoki et al .",
    "( 1998a ) at a large but not infinite hund coupling has established that the simple one - orbital double - exchange model has regions with mixed - phase tendencies , presenting an insulating resistivity ( moreo , yunoki and dagotto , 1999a ) at and near @xmath116=1 ( @xmath116 is the @xmath38 electron number per site ) , which becomes metallic as the electronic density is further reduced .",
    "the existence of a metal - insulator transition in this model opens the possibility that the one - orbital system may still present physics @xmath117 similar to that found experimentally , where such a transition is crucial in manganites . for this reason ,",
    "using the one - orbital model as a toy model for manganites is still quite acceptable , as long as the region of study is close to the metal - insulator regime .",
    "in fact recent work reporting percolative effects in this context use both the one- and two - orbital models with or without a strong jt coupling ( moreo et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "however , it is clear that the one - orbital model is incomplete for quantitative studies since it can not describe , e.g. , the key orbital - ordering of manganites and the proper charge - order states at x near 0.5 , which are so important for the truly cmr effect found in low - bandwidth manganites",
    ". then , the authors of this review fully agree with the conclusions of millis , littlewood and shraiman ( 1995 ) , although the arguments leading to such conclusion are different .",
    "it is clear that not even a fully disordered set of classical spins can scatter electrons as much as needed to reproduce the experiments ( again , unless large antiferromagnetic regions appear in a mixed - phase regime ) .    *",
    "jahn - teller phonons and polarons : *    millis , shraiman and mueller ( 1996 ) ( see also millis , mueller , and shraiman , 1996a , and millis , 1998 ) argued that the physics of manganites is dominated by the interplay between a strong electron - phonon coupling and the large hund coupling effect that optimizes the electronic kinetic energy by the generation of a fm phase .",
    "the large value of the electron phonon coupling is clear in the regime of manganites below x=0.20 where a static jt distortion plays a key role in the physics of the material .",
    "millis , shraiman and mueller ( 1996 ) argued that a dynamical jt effect may persist at higher hole densities , without leading to long - range order but producing important fluctuations that localize electrons by splitting the degenerate @xmath38 levels at a given mno@xmath118 octahedron .",
    "the calculations were carried out using the infinite dimensional approximation that corresponds to a @xmath119 mean - field technique where the polarons can have only a one site extension , and the classical limit for the phonons and spins was used .",
    "the latter approximation is not expected to be severe unless the temperatures are very low ( for a discussion see millis , mueller and shraiman , 1996b ) .",
    "the coulomb interactions were neglected , but further work reviewed below showed that jt and coulombic interactions lead to very similar results ( hotta , malvezzi , and dagotto , 2000 ) , and , as a consequence , this approximation is not severe either .",
    "orbital or charge ordering were not considered in the formalism of millis , shraiman and mueller ( 1996 ) . following the work of millis , littlewood and shraiman ( 1995 ) ,",
    "phonons were also argued to be of much importance in manganites by rder , zang and bishop ( 1996 ) , who found a tendency toward the formation of polarons in a single - orbital de model with quantum phonons , treating the localized spins in the mean - field approximation and the polaron formation with the lang - firsov variational approximation .",
    "coulomb interactions were later incorporated using the gutzwiller approximation ( zang , bishop and rder , 1996 ) .",
    "millis , shraiman and mueller ( 1996 ) argued that the ratio @xmath120=@xmath121/@xmath122 dominates the physics of the problem . here",
    "@xmath121 is the static trapping energy at a given octahedron , and @xmath122 is an effective hopping that is temperature dependent following the standard de discussion . in this context",
    "it was conjectured that when the temperature is larger than @xmath15 the effective coupling @xmath120 could be above the critical value that leads to insulating behavior due to electron localization , while it becomes smaller than the critical value below @xmath15 , thus inducing metallic behavior .",
    "the calculations were carried out using classical phonons and @xmath35 spins .",
    "the results of millis , shraiman and mueller ( 1996 ) for @xmath15 and the resistivity at a fixed density @xmath116=1 when plotted as a function of @xmath120 had formal similarities with experimental results ( which are produced as a function of density ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath120 is tuned to be very close to the metal - insulator transition , the resistivity naturally strongly depends on even small external magnetic fields .",
    "however , in order to describe the percolative nature of the transition found experimentally and the notorious phase separation tendencies , calculations beyond mean - field approximations are needed , as reviewed later in this paper .",
    "the existence of a critical value of the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath123 of order unity at @xmath116=1 leading to a metal - insulator transition is natural and it was also obtained in monte carlo ( mc ) simulations by yunoki et al .",
    "( 1998b ) . however , computational studies of the conductivity led to either insulating or metallic behavior at all temperatures , for values of @xmath123 above or below the critical temperature , respectively .",
    "a mixture of metal / insulator behavior in the resistivity at a fixed @xmath123 was not observed at @xmath116=1 .",
    "* iii.c models and parameters *    in the previous subsections , the theoretical work on manganites has been reviewed mainly in a historical order . in this section , the first steps toward a description of the latest theoretical developments in this context are taken .",
    "first , it is important to clearly write down the model hamiltonian for manganites . for complex material such as the mn - oxides , unfortunately ,",
    "the fullhamiltonian includes several competing tendencies and couplings .",
    "however , as shown below , the essential physics can be obtained using relatively simple models , deduced from the complicated full hamiltonian .",
    "* effect of crystal field : *    in order to construct the model hamiltonian for manganites , let us start our discussion at the level of the atomic problem , in which just one electron occupies a certain orbital in the @xmath31 shell of a manganese ion .",
    "although for an isolated ion a five - fold degeneracy exists for the occupation of the @xmath31 orbitals , this degeneracy is partially lifted by the crystal field due to the six oxygen ions surrounding the manganese forming an octahedron .",
    "this is analyzed by the ligand field theory that shows that the five - fold degeneracy is lifted into doubly - degenerate @xmath38-orbitals ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) and triply - degenerate @xmath35-orbitals ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ) .",
    "the energy difference between those two levels is usually expressed as @xmath124 , by following the traditional notation in the ligand field theory ( see , for instance , gerloch and slade , 1973 ) .    here",
    "note that the energy level for the @xmath35-orbitals is lower than that for @xmath38-orbitals .",
    "qualitatively this can be understood as follows : the energy difference originates in the coulomb interaction between the @xmath31 electrons and the oxygen ions surrounding manganese . while the wave - functions of the @xmath38-orbitals is extended along the direction of the bond between manganese and oxygen ions , those in the @xmath35-orbitals avoid this direction .",
    "thus , an electron in @xmath35-orbitals is not heavily influenced by the coulomb repulsion due to the negatively charged oxygen ions , and the energy level for @xmath35-orbitals is lower than that for @xmath38-orbitals .",
    "as for the value of @xmath124 , it is explicitly written as ( see gerloch and slade , 1973 ) @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the atomic number of the ligand ion , @xmath127 is the electron charge , @xmath128 is the distance between manganese and oxygen ions , @xmath129 is the coordinate of the @xmath31 orbital , and @xmath130 denotes the average value by using the radial wavefunction of the @xmath31 orbital .",
    "estimations by yoshida ( 1998 , page 29 ) suggest that 10@xmath131 is about 10000 - 15000@xmath132 ( remember that 1ev = 8063 @xmath132 ) .",
    "* coulomb interactions : *    consider now a mn@xmath9 ion , in which three electrons exist in the @xmath31 shells .",
    "although those electrons will occupy @xmath35-orbitals due to the crystalline field splitting , the configuration is not uniquely determined .",

    "namely , the strong on - site coulombic correlation plays the @xmath197 role as that of the jt phonon , at least at the mean - field level , indicating that it is not necessary to include @xmath143 explicitly in the models , as has been emphasized by the present authors in several publications ( see for instance hotta , malvezzi and dagotto ( 2000 ) ) . the latter equation for @xmath198 means that the one - site inter - orbital coulomb interaction is effectively reduced by the breathing - mode phonon , since the optical - mode phonon provides an effective attraction between electrons .",
    "the expected positive value of @xmath198 indicates that @xmath38 electrons dislike double occupancy at the site , since the energy loss is proportional to the average local electron number in the mean - field argument .",
    "thus , to exploit the gain due to the static jt energy and avoid the loss due to the on - site repulsion , an @xmath38 electron will singly occupy a given site .",
    "now let us briefly discuss how to solve the present mean - field hamiltonian on the background of the fixed @xmath35-spin arrangement . for some fixed spin pattern , by using appropriate initial values for the local densities @xmath199 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 , the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath202 is constructed , where the superscript number @xmath203 indicates the iteration step . by diagonalizing @xmath202 on finite clusters , and usually using a variety of boundary conditions depending on the problem , the improved local densities , @xmath204 , @xmath205 , and @xmath206 , are obtained .",
    "this procedure is simply repeated such that in the @xmath207-th iteration step , the local densities @xmath208 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 are obtained by using the hamiltonian @xmath211 . the iterations can be terminated if @xmath212@xmath112 @xmath213 @xmath26 @xmath214 , @xmath215@xmath112 @xmath216 @xmath26 @xmath214 , and @xmath217@xmath112 @xmath218 @xmath26@xmath214 are satisfied , where @xmath214 is taken to be a small number to control the convergence .    as for the choice of the cluster , in order to obtain the charge and orbital ordering pattern in the insulating phase , it is usually enough to treat a finite - size cluster with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "note that the cluster size should be large enough to reproduce the periodicity in the spin , charge , and orbital ordering under investigation . however , to consider the transition to the metallic state from the insulating phase , in principle it is necessary to treat an infinite cluster . of course , except for very special cases , it is impossible to treat the infinite - size cluster exactly , but fortunately , in the present mfa , it is quite effective to employ the twisted - boundary condition by introducing the momentum @xmath219 in the bloch phase factor @xmath220 at the boundary , where @xmath221=@xmath222 , and @xmath223 is the size of the cluster along the @xmath183-direction . note that if the spin directions are changed periodically , an additional phase factor appears to develop at the boundary , but this is not the case . in the present mfa ,",
    "the @xmath35-spin pattern is fixed from the outset , and the periodicity due to the spin pattern is already taken into account in the cluster .    finally , here comments on some of the assumptions employed in the present mfa are provided . in the first approximation for @xmath35-spins ,",
    "their pattern is fixed throughout the mean - field calculation and the nearest - neighbor spin configuration is assumed to be only fm or afm .",
    "note that this assumption does not indicate only the fully fm phase or three - dimensional g - type afm spin pattern , but it can include more complicated spin patterns such as the ce - type afm phase . however , under this assumption , several possible phases such as the spin canted phase and the spin flux phase , in which neighboring spins are neither fm nor afm , are neglected from the outset .",
    "unfortunately , this assumption for the fixed @xmath35 spin pattern can not be justified without extra tests .",
    "thus , it is unavoidable to confirm the assumption using other methods . in order to perform this check , unbiased numerical calculations such as the monte carlo simulations and relaxation techniques",
    "are employed to determine the local distortions , as well as the local spin directions . especially for a fixed electron number , the optimization technique is found to work quite well in this type of problems .",
    "then , our strategy to complete the mean - field calculations is as follows : ( i ) for some electron density and small - size cluster , the mean - field calculations are carried out for several fixed configurations of @xmath35 spins .",
    "( ii ) for the same electron density in the same size of cluster as in ( i ) , both local distortions and @xmath35-spin directions are optimized by using an appropriate computer code .",
    "( iii ) results obtained in ( i ) are compared to those in ( ii ) .",
    "if there occurs a serious disagreement between them , go back to step ( i ) and/or ( ii ) to do again the calculations by changing the initial inputs . in this retrial , by comparing the energies between the cases ( i ) and ( ii ) , the initial condition for the case with higher energy should be replaced with that for the lower energy .",
    "to save cpu time it is quite effective to combine analytic mfa and numerical techniques .",
    "( iv ) after several iterations , if a satisfactory agreement between ( i ) and ( ii ) is obtained , the mfa on a larger - size cluster is used to improve the results in ( i ) .",
    "namely , by combining the mfa and the optimization technique , it is possible to reach physically important results in a rapid and reliable way .    as for the assumption made regarding the use of non - cooperative phonons in the mfa , it is also checked by comparing the non - cooperative mean - field results with the optimized ones for cooperative distortions .",
    "note here that , due to the cpu and memory restrictions , the optimization technique can not treat large - size clusters .",
    "however , this numerical technique has the clear advantage that it is easily extended to include the cooperative effect by simply changing the coordinates from @xmath224 to @xmath225 , where @xmath225 symbolically indicates the oxygen displacements , while @xmath224 denotes the local distortions of the mno@xmath118 octahedron . the effect of the cooperative phonons will be discussed separately for several values of the hole density .    *",
    "iii.d main results : one orbital model *    * phase diagram with classical localized spins : *    although the one - orbital model for manganites is clearly incomplete to describe these compounds since , by definition , it has only one active orbital , nevertheless it has been shown in recent calculations that it captures part of the interesting competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases in these compounds .",
    "for this reason , and since this model is far simpler than the more realistic two - orbital model , it is useful to study it in detail .",
    "a fairly detailed analysis of the phase diagram of the one - orbital model has been recently presented , mainly using computational techniques .",
    "typical results are shown in fig.iii.d.1a-c for @xmath226=1 , 2 , and @xmath74 ( @xmath226 is spatial dimension ) , the first two obtained with monte carlo techniques at low temperature , and the third with the dynamical mean - field approximation in the large @xmath106 limit varying temperature .",
    "there are several important features in the results which are common in all dimensions . at @xmath38-density = 1.0 , the system is antiferromagnetic ( although this is not clearly shown in fig.iii.d.1 ) .",
    "the reason is that at large hund coupling , double occupancy in the ground state is negligible at @xmath38-density = 1.0 or lower , and at these densities it is energetically better to have nearest - neighbor spins antiparallel , gaining an energy of order @xmath227 , rather than to align them , since in such a case the system is basically frozen due to the pauli principle . on the other hand , at finite hole density , antiferromagnetism is replaced by the tendency of holes to polarize the spin background to improve their kinetic energy , as discussed in section iii.a .",
    "then , a very prominent ferromagnetic phase develops in the model as shown in fig.iii.d.1 .",
    "this fm tendency appears in all dimensions of interest , and it manifests itself in the monte carlo simulations through the rapid growth with decreasing temperature , and/or increasing number of sites , of the zero - momentum spin - spin correlation , as shown in fig.iii.d.2a-b reproduced from yunoki et al .",
    "( 1998a ) .",
    "in real space , the results correspond to spin correlations between two sites at a distance @xmath30 which do not decay to a vanishing number as @xmath30 grows , if there is long - range order ( see results in dagotto et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "in 1d , quantum fluctuations are expected to be so strong that long - range order can not be achieved , but in this case the spin correlations still can decay slowly with distance following a power law . in practice ,",
    "the tendency toward fm or af is so strong even in 1d that issues of long - range order vs power - law decays are not of much importance for studying the dominant tendencies in the model .",
    "nevertheless , care must be taken with these subtleties if very accurate studies are attempted in 1d .    in 3d",
    ", long - range order can be obtained at finite temperature and indeed it occurs in the one - orbital model .",
    "a rough estimation of the critical curie temperature @xmath15 is shown in fig.iii.d.3 based on small 6@xmath228 3d clusters ( from yunoki et al . , 1998a ) .",
    "@xmath15 is of the order of just 0.1 t , while other estimations predicted a much higher value ( millis , littlewood and shraiman ( 1995 ) ) . more recent work has refined @xmath15 , but the order of magnitude found in the first monte carlo simulations remains the same ( see calderon and brey , 1998 ; yi , hur , and yu , 1999 ; motome and furukawa , 1999 ; held and vollhardt , 1999 ) .",
    "if @xmath115 is about 0.2ev , the @xmath15 becomes of the order of 200k , a value in reasonable agreement with experiments .",
    "however , remember that this model can not describe orbital order properly , and thus it remains a crude approximation to manganites .",
    "the most novel result emerging from the computational studies of the one - orbital model is the way in which the fm phase is reached by hole doping of the af phase at = 1.0 .",
    "as explained before , mean - field approximations by de gennes ( 1960 ) suggested that this interpolation should proceed through a so - called `` canted '' state in which the spin structure remains antiferromagnetic in two directions but develops a uniform moment along the third direction . for many years this canted state",
    "was assumed to be correct , and many experiments were analyzed based on such state .",
    "however , the computational studies showed that instead of a canted state , an electronic `` phase separated '' ( ps ) regime interpolates between the fm and af phases .",
    "this ps region is very prominent in the phase diagram of fig.iii.d.1a-c in all dimensions .    as an example of how ps is obtained from the computational work , consider fig.iii.d.4 . in the monte carlo simulations carried out in this context , performed in the grand - canonical ensemble ,",

    "this means that there is a finite range of densities which are simply unreachable , i.e. , that they can not be stabilized regardless of how carefully @xmath229 is tuned .",
    "if the chemical potential is fixed to the value where the discontinuity occurs , frequent tunneling events among the two limiting densities are observed ( dagotto et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "in the inset of fig.iii.d.4a , the spin correlations are shown for the two densities at the extremes of the discontinuity , and they correspond to fm and af states .    strictly speaking , the presence of ps means that the model has a range of densities which can not be accessed , and thus , those densities are simply @xmath231 .",
    "this is clarified better using now the canonical ensemble , where the number of particles is fixed as an input and @xmath229 is an output . in this context , suppose that one attempts to stabilize a density such as = 0.95 ( unstable in fig.iii.d.4 ) , by locating , say , 95 electrons into a 10@xmath23210 lattice .",
    "the ground - state of such a system will not develop a uniform density , but instead two regions separated in space will be formed : a large one with approximately 67 sites and 67 electrons ( density 1.0 ) and a smaller one with 33 sites and 28 electrons ( density @xmath450.85 ) . the last density is the lower value in the discontinuity of fig.iii.d.4b in 2d , i.e. , the first stable density after = 1.0 when holes are introduced . then , whether using canonical or grand - canonical approximations , a range of densities remains unstable .",
    "the actual spatial separation into two macroscopic regions ( fm and af in this case ) leads to an energy problem . in the simulations and other mean - field approximations that produce ps ,",
    "the `` tail '' of the coulomb interaction was not explicitly included . in other words ,",
    "the electric charge was not properly accounted for .",
    "once this long - range coulomb interaction is introduced into the problem , the fact that the fm and af states involved in ps have different densities leads to a huge energy penalization even considering a large dielectric constant due to polarization ( charge certainly can not be accumulated in a macroscopic portion of a sample ) .",
    "for this reason , it is more reasonable to expect that the ps domains will break into smaller pieces , as sketched in fig.iii.d.5 ( moreo et al .",
    ", 1999a ; see also section iii.i ) .",
    "the shape of these pieces remains to be investigated in detail since the calculations are difficult with long - range interactions ( for results in 1d see below ) , but droplets or stripes appear as a serious possibility .",
    "this state would now be @xmath233 , since it would satisfy in part the tendency toward phase separation and also it will avoid a macroscopic charge accumulation .",
    "although detailed calculations are not available , the common folklore is that the typical size of the clusters in the mixed - phase state arising from the competition ps vs. @xmath234 coulomb will be in the @xmath235 scale , i.e. , just a few lattice spacings since the mn - mn distance is about 4@xmath85 .",
    "this is the electronic `` phase separated '' state that one usually has in mind as interpolating between fm and af .",
    "small clusters of fm are expected to be created in the af background , and as the hole density grows , these clusters will increase in number and eventually overcome the af clusters . for more details",
    "see also section iii.i , where the effort of other authors in the context of ps is also described .    * spin incommensurability and stripes : *    in the regime of intermediate or small @xmath106 , the one - orbital model does not have ferromagnetism at small hole densities , which is reasonable since a large @xmath106 was needed in the discussion of section iii.a to understand the stabilization of a spin polarized phase .",
    "instead , in this regime of @xmath106 the spin sector develops @xmath236 ( ic ) , namely the peak in the fourier transform of the real space spin - spin correlations is neither at 0 ( fm ) nor at @xmath102 ( af ) , but at intermediate momenta .",
    "this feature is robust and it appears both in 1d and 2d simulations , as well as with both classical and quantum spins ( yunoki et al . , 1998a , dagotto et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "an example in 2d is presented in fig.iii.d.6a . since",
    "a regime with ic characteristics had not been found in experiments by the time the initial monte carlo simulations were carried out , the spin ic regime was not given much importance , and its origin remained unclear .",
    "however , recent neutron scattering results ( adams et al . , 2000 ;",
    "dai et al . , 2000",
    "; kubota et al . , 2000 ) suggest that spin incommensurability may appear in some compounds leading to stripe formation , similar to that found in the cuprates .",
    "this result induced us to further examine the numerical data obtained in the original monte carlo simulations .",
    "it turns out that the spin ic structure found in the 2d one - orbital model has its origin in @xmath237 , as shown in fig.iii.d.6b .",
    "these structures correspond to 1d - like regions of the 2d plane that are populated by holes , leaving undoped the area between the stripes , similar to those structures that are believed to occur in some high temperature superconductors and @xmath115-@xmath144-like models ( tranquada , 1995 ; dai et al .",

    "unfortunately , it is very difficult to study quantum spins in combination with mobile fermions , and the approximation can be explicitly tested only in a few cases .",

    "these populated orbitals are not necessarily only the two initial ones used in the definition of the hamiltonian , in the same way that in a heisenberg spin system not only spins up and down in the @xmath111-direction ( the usual basis ) are possible in mean value .",
    "actually , spins can order with a mean - value pointing in any direction depending on the model and couplings , and the same occurs with the orbitals , which in this respect are like `` pseudospins '' .",
    "a particular combination of the original orbitals 1 and 2 could be energetically the best in even sites and some other combination in the odd sites . in fig.iii.e.1 ,",
    "as @xmath123 increases further , a second transition was identified this time into a state which is staggered in the spin , and uniform in the orbitals .",
    "such a state is the one in correspondence with the af state found in the one - orbital model , namely only one orbital matters at low energies and the spin , as a consequence , is antiferromagnetic .",
    "however , from the experimental point of view , the intermediate regime between 1.0 and 2.0 is the most relevant , since staggered orbital order is known to occur in experiments .",
    "then , the one orbital model envisioned to work for manganites , at least close to = 1.0 due to the static jahn - teller distortion , actually does not work even there since it misses the staggered orbital order but instead assumes a uniform order .",
    "nevertheless the model is qualitatively interesting , as remarked upon before .",
    "why does orbital order occur here ?",
    "this can be easily understood perturbatively in the hopping @xmath115 , following fig.iii.e.2 where a single mn - mn link is used and the four possibilities ( spin fm or af , orbital uniform or staggered ) are considered . a hopping matrix only connecting the same orbitals , with hopping parameter @xmath115 , is assumed for simplicity .",
    "the energy difference between @xmath38 orbitals at a given site is @xmath121 , which is a monotonous function of @xmath123 . for simplicity ,",
    "in the notation let us refer to orbital uniform ( staggered ) as orbital `` fm '' ( `` af '' ) .",
    "case ( a ) in fig.iii.e.2 corresponds to spin fm and orbital af : in this case when an electron moves from orbital a on the left to the same orbital on the right , which is the only possible hopping by assumption , an energy of order @xmath121 is lost , but kinetic energy is gained . as in any second order perturbative",
    "calculation the energy gain is then proportional to @xmath254 . in case",
    "( b ) , both spin and orbital fm , the electrons do not move and the energy gain is zero ( again , the nondiagonal hoppings are assumed negligible just for simplicity ) . in case ( c ) ,",
    "the spin are af but the orbitals are fm .",
    "this is like a one orbital model and the gain in energy is proportional to @xmath255 .",
    "finally , in case ( d ) with af in spin and orbital , both hund and orbital splitting energies are lost in the intermediate state , and the overall gain becomes proportional to @xmath256 . as a consequence ,",
    "if the hund coupling is larger than @xmath121 , then case ( a ) is the best , as it occurs at intermediate @xmath121 values in fig.iii.e.1 .",
    "however , in the opposite case ( orbital splitting larger than hund coupling ) case ( c ) has the lowest energy , a result also compatible to that found in fig.iii.e.1 .",
    "then , the presence of orbital order can be easily understood from a perturbative estimation , quite similarly as done by kugel and khomskii ( 1974 ) in their pioneering work on orbital order .",
    "recently , x - ray resonant scattering studies have confirmed the orbital order in manganites ( murakami et al .",
    ", 1998a ; murakami et al . , 1998b ) .",
    "* a - type af at x=0.0 : *    the alert reader may have noticed that the state reported in the previous analysis at intermediate @xmath123 s is actually not quite the same state as found in experiments .",
    "it is known that the actual state has a - type af spin order , while in the analysis of fig.iii.e.1 , such a state was not included .",
    "the intermediate @xmath123 region has fm spin in the three directions in the 3d simulations of that figure .",
    "something else must be done in order to arrive at an a - type antiferromagnet .",
    "recent investigations by hotta et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have shown that , in the context of the model with jahn - teller phonons , this missing ingredient is @xmath238 itself , namely by increasing this coupling from 0.05 to larger values , a transition from a fm to an a - type af exists ( the relevance of jt couplings at = 1.0 has also been remarked by capone , feinberg , and grilli , 2000 ) .",
    "this can be visualized easily in fig.iii.e.3 where the energy vs. @xmath238 at fixed intermediate @xmath123 and @xmath106 is shown .",
    "four regimes were identified : fm , a - af , c - af , and g - af , states that are sketched also in that figure .",
    "the reason is simple : as @xmath238 grows , the tendency toward spin af must grow since this coupling favors such an order . if @xmath238 is very large , then it is clear that a g - af state must be the one that lowers the energy , in agreement with the monte carlo simulations .",
    "if @xmath238 is small or zero , there is no reason why spin af will be favorable at intermediate @xmath123 and the density under consideration , and then the state is ferromagnetic to improve the electronic mobility .",
    "it should be no surprise that at intermediate @xmath238 , the dominant state is intermediate between the two extremes , with a - type and c - type antiferromagnetism becoming stable in intermediate regions of parameter space .",
    "it is interesting to note that similar results regarding the relevance of @xmath238 to stabilize the a - type order have been found by koshibae et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in a model with coulomb interactions .",
    "an analogous conclusion was found by solovyev , hamada , and terakura ( 1996 ) and ishihara et al .",
    "betouras and fujimoto ( 1999 ) , using bosonization techniques for the 1d one - orbital model , also emphasized the importance of @xmath238 , similarly as did yi , yu , and lee ( 1999 ) based on monte carlo studies in two dimensions of the same model .",
    "the overall conclusion is that there are clear analogies between the strong coulomb and strong jahn - teller coupling approaches , as discussed elsewhere in this review .",
    "actually in the mean - field approximation presented in section iii.c it was shown that the influence of the coulombic terms can be hidden in simple redefinitions of the electron - phonon couplings ( see also benedetti and zeyher , 1999 ) . in our opinion , both approaches ( jt and coulomb ) have strong similarities and it is not surprising that basically the same physics is obtained in both cases . actually , fig.2 of maezono , ishihara , and nagaosa ( 1998b ) showing the energy vs. @xmath238 in mean - field calculations of the coulombic hamiltonian without phonons is very similar to our fig.iii.e.3 , aside from overall scales . on the other hand , mizokawa and fujimori ( 1995 , 1996 ) states that the a - type af is stabilized only when the jahn - teller distortion is included , namely , the fm phase is stabilized in the purely coulomb model , based on the unrestricted hartree - fock calculation for the @xmath30-@xmath83 model .",

    "this is ps triggered by the @xmath257 degrees of freedom , which is a novel concept . on the other hand , the ps observed at low density is very similar to that observed in the one - orbital model involving spin fm and af states in competition . finally , at @xmath450.5 and large",
    "@xmath123 , charge ordering takes place , but this phase will be discussed in more detail later .",
    "overall , it is quite reassuring to observe that the stable phases in fig.iii.e.4c all have an analog in experiments .",
    "this gives support to the models used and to the computational and mean - field techniques employed .",
    "in addition , since all stable regions are realistic , it is natural to assume that the rest of the phase diagram , namely the ps regions , must also have an analog in experiments in the form of mixed - phase tendencies and nanometer - size cluster formation , as discussed in the case of the one - orbital model .",
    "ps is very prominent in all the models studied , as long as proper many - body techniques are employed .",
    "for instance , using accurate mean - field approximations , the ps tendencies in 1d can also be properly reproduced ( see section v of hotta , malvezzi and dagotto , 2000 ) . it is also important that even in purely coulombic cases ( without jt phonons ) , ps has been found in 1d models in some regions of parameter space ( see hotta , malvezzi and dagotto , 2000 ) , and , thus , this phenomenon is not restricted to jahn - teller systems .",
    "kagan , khomskii , and kugel ( 2000 ) also reported phase separation near x=0.5 without using jt phonons .",
    "guerrero and noack ( 2000 ) reported phase separation in a one - dimensional copper - oxide model with only coulomb interactions .",
    "varelogiannis ( 2000 ) found coexistence and competition of co , af and fm phases in a multicomponent mean - field - theory , without using a particular microscopic mechanism .",
    "it is important to remark that plenty of work still remains to be done in establishing the phase diagram of the two - orbitals model .",
    "studies in 2d carried out by our group suggest that the phase diagram is similar to that found in 1d , but details remain to be settled .",
    "the 3d diagram is known only in special cases .",
    "although the experience gained in the one - orbital model suggests that all dimensions have similar phase diagrams , this issue remains to be confirmed in the two - orbital case at large @xmath123 .",
    "in addition , also note that the intermediate @xmath258 regime has not been explored and surprises may be found there , such as the stripes described for the one - orbital case at intermediate hund coupling .",
    "work is in progress in this challenging area of research .",
    "* charge ordering at x=0.5 and the ce - state : *    the so - called ce - type afm phase has been established as the ground state of half - doped perovskite manganites in the 1950 s .",
    "this phase is composed of zigzag fm arrays of @xmath35-spins , which are coupled antiferromagnetically perpendicular to the zigzag direction .",
    "furthermore , the checkerboard - type charge ordering in the @xmath109-@xmath110 plane , the charge stacking along the @xmath111-axis , and ( @xmath259/@xmath260 ) orbital ordering are associated with this phase .",
    "although there is little doubt that the famous ce - state of goodenough , reviewed in sec.iii.a , is indeed the ground state of x=0.5 intermediate and low bandwidth manganites , only very recently such a state has received theoretical confirmation using unbiased techniques , at least within some models . in the early approach of goodenough",
    "it was @xmath261 that the charge was distributed in a checkerboard pattern , upon which spin and orbital order was found .",
    "but it would be desirable to obtain the ce - state based entirely upon a more fundamental theoretical analysis , as the true state of minimum energy of a well - defined and realistic hamiltonian .",
    "if such a calculation can be done , as a bonus one would find out which states compete with the ce - state in parameter space , an issue very important in view of the mixed - phase tendencies of mn - oxides , which can not be handled within the approach of goodenough .    one may naively believe that it is as easy as introducing a huge nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath246 to stabilize a charge - ordered state at x=0.5 , upon which the reasoning of goodenough can be applied . however , there are at least two problems with this approach .",
    "first , such a large @xmath246 quite likely will destabilize the ferromagnetic charge - disordered state and others supposed to be competing with the ce - state",
    ". it may be possible to explain the ce - state with this approach , but not others also observed at x=0.5 in large bandwidth mn - oxides .",
    "second , a large @xmath246 would produce a checkerboard pattern in the @xmath262 directions .",
    "however , experimentally it has been known for a long time ( wollan and koehler , 1955 ) that the charge @xmath263 along the @xmath111-axis , namely the same checkerboard pattern is repeated along @xmath111 , rather than being shifted by one lattice spacing from plane to plane .",
    "a dominant coulomb interaction @xmath246 can not be the whole story for x=0.5 low - bandwidth manganese oxides .",
    "the nontrivial task of finding a ce - state with charge stacked along the @xmath111-axis without the use of a huge nearest - neighbors repulsion has been recently performed by yunoki , hotta , and dagotto ( 2000 ) using the two - orbital model with strong electron jahn - teller phonon coupling .",
    "the calculation proceeded using an unbiased monte carlo simulation , and as an output of the study , the ce - state indeed emerged as the ground - state in some region of coupling space .",
    "typical results are shown in fig.iii.e.5 . in part",
    "( a ) the energy at very low temperature is shown as a function of @xmath238 at fixed density x=0.5 , @xmath106=@xmath74 for simplicity , and with a robust electron - phonon coupling @xmath123=1.5 using the two orbital model of sec.iii.c . at small @xmath238 ,",
    "a ferromagnetic phase was found to be stabilized , according to the monte carlo simulation .",
    "actually , at @xmath238=0.0 it has not been possible to stabilize a partially af - state at x=0.5 , namely the states are always ferromagnetic at least within the wide range of @xmath123 s investigated ( but they can have charge and orbital order ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as @xmath238 grows , a tendency to form af links develops , as it happens at x=0.0 . at large @xmath238 eventually the system transitions to states that are mostly antiferromagnetic , such as the so - called `` af(2 ) '' state of fig.iii.e.5b ( with an up - up - down - down spin pattern repeated along one axis , and af coupling along the other axis ) , or directly a fully af - state in both directions .    however , the intermediate values of @xmath238 are the most interesting ones . in this case",
    "the energy of the 2d clusters become flat as a function of @xmath238 suggesting that the state has the same number of fm and af links , a property that the ce - state indeed has . by measuring charge - correlations",
    "it was found that a checkerboard pattern is formed particularly at intermediate and large @xmath123 s , as in the ce - state .",
    "finally , after measuring the spin and orbital correlations , it was confirmed that indeed the complex pattern of the ce - state was fully stabilized in the simulation .",
    "this occurs in a robust portion of the @xmath123-@xmath238 plane , as shown in fig.iii.e.5b .",
    "the use of @xmath238 as the natural parameter to vary in order to understand the ce - state is justified based on fig.iii.e.5b since the region of stability of the ce - phase is elongated along the @xmath123-axis , meaning that its existence is not so much dependent on that coupling but much more on @xmath238 itself .",
    "it appears that some explicit tendency in the hamiltonian toward the formation of af links is necessary to form the ce - state .",
    "if this tendency is absent , a fm state if formed , while if it is too strong an af - state appears .",
    "the x=0.5 ce - state , similar to the a - type af at x=0.0 , needs an intermediate value of @xmath238 for stabilization .",
    "the stability window is finite and in this respect there is no need to carry out a @xmath264 tuning of parameters to find the ce phase .",
    "however , it is clear that there is a balance of af and fm tendencies in the ce - phase that makes the state somewhat fragile .",
    "note that the transitions among the many states obtained when varying @xmath238 are all of @xmath92 order , namely they correspond to crossings of levels at zero temperature .",
    "the first - order character of these transitions is a crucial ingredient of the recent scenario proposed by moreo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) involving mixed - phase tendencies with coexisting clusters with @xmath265 density , to be described in more detail below .",
    "recently , first - order transitions have also been reported in the one - orbital model at x=0.5 by alonso et al .",
    "( 2000a , 2000b ) , as well as tendencies toward phase separation .",
    "recent progress in the development of powerful techniques for manganite models ( alonso et al .",
    ", 2000c ; motome and furukawa , 2000a , 2000b ) will contribute to the clarification of these issues in the near future .",
    "* charge stacking : *    let us address now the issue of charge - stacking along the @xmath111-axis . for this purpose simulations using 3d clusters were carried out .",
    "the result for the energy vs. @xmath238 is shown in fig.iii.e.6 , with @xmath106=@xmath74 and @xmath123=1.5 fixed . the ce - state with charge - stacking was found to be the ground state on a wide @xmath238 window .",
    "the reason that this state has lower energy than the so - called `` wigner - crystal '' ( wc ) version of the ce - state , namely with the charge spread as much as possible , is once again the influence of @xmath238 . with a charge stacked arrangement , the links along the @xmath111-axis can all be simultaneously antiferromagnetic , thereby minimizing the energy . in the wc - state",
    "this is not possible .",
    "it should be noted that this charge stacked ce - state is not immediately destroyed when the weak nearest - neighbor repulsion @xmath246 is introduced to the model , as shown in the mean - field calculations by hotta , malvezzi , and dagotto ( 2000 ) .",
    "if @xmath246 is further increased for a realistic value of @xmath238 , the ground state eventually changes from the charge stacked ce - phase to the wc version of the ce - state or the c - type afm phase with wc charge ordering . as explained above",
    ", the stability of the charge stacked phase to the wc version of the ce - state is due to the magnetic energy difference .",
    "however , the competition between the charge - stacked ce - state and the c - type afm phase with the wc structure is not simply understood by the effect of @xmath238 , since those two kinds of afm phases have the same magnetic energy . in this case , the stabilization of the charge stacking originates from the difference in the geometry of the 1d fm - path , namely a zigzag - path for the ce - phase and a straight - line path for the c - type afm state . as will be discussed later in detail ,",
    "the energy for @xmath38 electrons in the zigzag path is lower than that in the straight - line path , and this energy difference causes the stabilization of the charge stacking . in short ,",
    "the stability of the charge - stacked structure at the expense of @xmath246 is supported by `` the geometric energy '' as well as the magnetic energy .",
    "note that each energy gain is just a fraction of @xmath115 .",
    "thus , in the absence of other mechanisms to understand the charge - stacking , another consequence of this analysis is that @xmath246 actually must be substantially @xmath266 than naively expected , otherwise such a charge pattern would not be stable .",
    "in fact , estimations given by yunoki , hotta , and dagotto ( 2000 ) suggest that the manganites must have a large dielectric function at short distances ( see arima and tokura , 1995 ) to prevent the melting of the charge - stacked state .    note also that the mean - field approximations by hotta , malvezzi , and dagotto ( 2000 ) have shown that on - site coulomb interactions @xmath142 and @xmath143 can @xmath267 generate a 2d ce - state , in agreement with the calculations by van den brink et al .",
    "then , the present authors believe that strong jt and coulomb couplings tend to give similar results . this belief finds partial confirmation in the mean - field approximations of hotta , malvezzi , and dagotto ( 2000 ) , where the similarities between a strong @xmath123 and @xmath268 were investigated . even doing the calculation with coulombic interactions ,",
    "the influence of @xmath238 is still crucial to inducing charge - stacking ( note that the importance of this parameter has also been recently remarked by mathieu , svedlindh and nordblad , 2000 , based on experimental results ) .",
    "many other authors carried out important work in the context of the ce - state at x=0.5 .",
    "for example , with the help of hartree - fock calculations , mizokawa and fujimori ( 1997 ) reported the stabilization of the ce - state at x=0.5 only if jahn - teller distortions were incorporated into a model with coulomb interactions .",
    "this state was found to be in competition with a uniform fm state , as well as with an a - type af - state with uniform orbital order . in this respect",
    "the results are very similar to those found by yunoki , hotta and dagotto ( 2000 ) using monte carlo simulations .",
    "in addition , using a large nearest neighbor repulsion and the one - orbital model , charge ordering and a spin structure compatible with the zigzag chains of the ce state was found by lee and min ( 1997 ) at x=0.5 . also jackeli et al .",
    "( 1999 ) obtained charge - ordering at x=0.5 using mean - field approximations and a large @xmath246 .",

    "( 1997 ) using lsda+u techniques .",
    "* topological origin of the x=0.5 ce - state *    the fact that @xmath123 does not play the most crucial role for the ce - state also emerges from the `` topological '' arguments of hotta et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , where at least the formation of zigzag ferromagnetic chains with antiferromagnetic interchain coupling , emerges directly for @xmath123=0 and large @xmath106 , as a consequence of the `` band - insulator''character of those chains .",

    "to simplify the discussion , the limiting case of @xmath106=@xmath74 is considered .",
    "namely , the @xmath38-electrons can move only along the zigzag fm path , since the hopping perpendicular to the zigzag direction vanishes due to the standard de mechanism and the antiferromagnetism between chains , indicating that the spin degree of freedom can be effectively neglected .",
    "thus , the problem is reduced to the analysis of the @xmath38 electron motion along the one - dimensional zigzag chain .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that this is still a highly non - trivial system .    to solve the present one - body problem ,",
    "a unit - cell is defined as shown in fig.iii.e.7 , in which the hopping amplitudes change with a period of four lattice spacings , since the hopping direction changes as @xmath272 along the zigzag chain , with @xmath273=@xmath274 for @xmath275 according to the values of the hopping amplitudes discussed before .",
    "this difference in sign , i.e. , the phase change , is essential for this problem . to make this point clear , it is useful to transform the spinless @xmath38-electron operators by using a unitary matrix as ( see koizumi et al . , 1998a )",

    "although it is very easy to solve the present eigenvalue problem by using the computer , it is instructive to find the solution analytically . in the process of finding this solution , several important points will be clarified .",
    "first , note that there are two eigenfunctions of the 8@xmath2328 matrix which have a `` localized '' character , satisfying @xmath299 and @xmath300 as easily checked by simple algebra , those localized basis functions correspond to @xmath301 and @xmath302 orbitals at sites 2 and 4 , respectively . by orthogonality , the active orbitals",
    "are then fixed as @xmath259 and @xmath260 at sites 2 and 4 , respectively .",
    "this fact suggests that if some potential acts over the @xmath38-electrons , the @xmath303-type orbital ordering immediately occurs in such a one - dimensional zigzag path due to the standard peierls instability .",
    "this point will be discussed again later in the context of charge - orbital ordering due to the jt distortion .    to find the other extended eigenstates , it is quite natural to consider active basis functions at sites 2 and 4 , given by @xmath304 and @xmath305 , respectively .",
    "then , the bonding and antibonding combinations of those basis are constructed by including appropriate phases such as @xmath306.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by acting with @xmath292 over @xmath307 , it is found that two kinds of @xmath308 block hamiltonians @xmath309 can be constructed using new basis functions defined as @xmath310 and @xmath311 as expected , the block hamiltonian including the ground state is constructed using the bonding - type basis functions @xmath312 where the @xmath308 matrix @xmath313 is given by @xmath314 with @xmath315 . by solving this eigenvalue problem , it can be easily shown that the eigenenergies are @xmath316 note here that the momentum @xmath285 is restricted to the reduced zone , @xmath317 .",
    "as expected , the lowest - energy band has a minimum at @xmath285=0 , indicating that this block correctly includes the ground state of the one @xmath38-electron problem . at a first glance ,",
    "this point appears obvious , but if the effect of the local phase is not treated correctly , an unphysical solution easily appears , as will be discussed below .",
    "the block hamiltonian for the antibonding sector is given by @xmath318 with @xmath319 the eigenenergies are given by @xmath320 in summary , eight eigenenergies have been obtained as @xmath321 where the flat band @xmath322=0 has four - fold degeneracy . the band structure is shown in fig.iii.e.8 .",
    "the most remarkable feature is that the system is _ band - insulating _",
    ", with a bandgap of value @xmath323 for quarter filling , i.e. , x=0.5 . this band insulating state , without any explicit potential among the electrons moving along the zigzag chains , is caused by the phase difference between @xmath324 and @xmath325 .",
    "intuitively , such band - insulator originates in the presence of a standing - wave state due to the interference between two traveling waves running along the @xmath109- and @xmath110-directions . in this interference picture",
    ", the nodes of the wavefunction can exist on  the corner \" of the zigzag structure , and the probability amplitude becomes larger in the",
    " straight \" segment of the path .",
    "thus , even a weak potential can produce the charge and orbital ordering based on this band - insulating phase .",
    "since @xmath323 is at least of the order of 1000k , this band - insulating state is considered to be very robust .",
    "in fact , if some potential is included into such an insulating phase , the system maintains its `` insulating '' properties , and a modulation in the orbital density appears .",
    "the problem in the zigzag one - dimensional chain provided us with a typical example to better understand the importance of the additional factor @xmath326 in front of the @xmath295 su(2 ) unitary matrix to generate the phase dressed operator at each site .",
    "as clearly shown above , the `` a '' and `` b '' orbitals should be chosen as `` a''=@xmath301 and `` b''=@xmath259 at site 2 , and `` a''=@xmath302 and `` b''=@xmath260 at site 4 , respectively .",
    "namely , @xmath327=@xmath328 and @xmath329=@xmath330 .",
    "the reason for these choices of @xmath152 is easily understood due to the fact that the orbital tends to polarize along the hopping direction to maximize the overlap .",
    "thus , to make the hamiltonian simple , it is useful to fix the orbitals at sites 2 and 4 as @xmath327=@xmath328 and @xmath329=@xmath330 . here , the phase factor @xmath326 in the basis function is essential to reproduce exactly the same solution as obtained in the discussion above .",
    "as already mentioned , in a single - site problem , this phase factor can be neglected , since it provides only an additional phase to the whole wave function .",
    "however , if the @xmath38-electron starts moving from site to site , the accumulation of the phase difference between adjacent sites does not lead just to an additional phase factor to the whole wave function .",
    "in fact , if this additional phase is accidentally neglected , the band structure will shift in momentum space as @xmath285@xmath95@xmath331 , indicating that the minimum of the lowest - energy band is not located at @xmath285=0 , but at @xmath285=@xmath102 , as already pointed out by koizumi et al .",
    "of course , this can be removed by the redefinition of @xmath285 by including `` the crystal momentum '' , but it is not necessary to redefine @xmath285 , if the local phase factors are correctly included in the problem .",
    "now let us discuss the stabilization of the zigzag structure in the ce - type phase .",
    "although it is true that the zigzag one - dimensional fm chain has a large band - gap , this fact does not guarantee that this band - insulating phase is the lowest - energy state .",
    "to prove that the ce - type afm phase composed of these zigzag fm chains is truly the ground - state , at least the following three points should be clarified : ( i ) does this zigzag structure have the lowest energy compared to other zigzag paths with the same periodicity and compared with the straight one - dimensional path ? ( ii )",
    "does the periodicity with four lattice spacings produce the @xmath332 ground - state ?",
    "in other words , can zigzag structures with another periodicity be the global ground - state ?",
    "( iii ) is the energy of the zigzag afm phase lower than that of the fm or other afm phases ?",
    "all these points have been clarified in hotta et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and here the essential points are discussed briefly .",
    "the first point can be checked by directly comparing the energies for all possible zigzag structures with the periodicity of four lattice spacings . due to translational invariance , there exist four types of zigzag states which are classified by the sequence of the hopping directions : @xmath333 , @xmath334 , @xmath335 , and @xmath336 . for quarter - filling , by an explicit calculation it has been shown that the zigzag pattern denoted by @xmath336 has the lowest energy among them ( see details in hotta et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ) , but here an intuitive explanation is provided .",
    "the state characterized by @xmath333 is , of course , the one - dimensional metal with a dispersion relation simply given by @xmath337 .",
    "note that in this straight fm chain , the active orbital at every site is @xmath259 , since the hopping direction is restricted to be along the @xmath109-direction . as emphasized in the above discussion ,",
    "a periodic change in the hopping amplitude produces a band - gap , indicating that the metallic state has an energy higher than the band - insulating states . among them ,",
    "the state with the largest bandgap will be the ground - state .",
    "after several calculations at quarter - filling , the zigzag state with @xmath336 was found to have the lowest energy , but without any calculation this result can be deduced based on the interference effect . as argued above , due to the interference of two traveling waves along the @xmath109- and @xmath110-directions",
    ", a standing - wave state occurs with nodes on the corner sites , and a large probability amplitude at the sites included in the straight segments . to contain two @xmath38-electrons in the unit cell with four lattice spacings , at least two sites in the straight segment",
    "are needed . moreover ,",
    "the nodes are distributed with equal spacing in the wavefunction as long as no external potential is applied .",
    "thus , it is clear that the lowest - energy state corresponds to the zigzag structure with @xmath336 .",
    "as for the second point regarding the periodicity , it is quite difficult to carry out the direct comparison among the energies for all possible states , since there are infinite possibilities for the combinations of hopping directions . instead , to mimic the periodic change of the phase @xmath278 in the hopping process , let us imagine a virtual situation in which a jt distortion occurs in the one - dimensional @xmath38-electron system , by following koizumi at al .",

    "when the periodicity @xmath341 is equal to @xmath360 , the energy becomes the lowest among the states considered here with several possible periods .",
    "although this is just a proof in an idealized special situation , it is believed that it captures the essence of the problem .    here the effect of the local phase factor @xmath361 should be again noted . if this factor is dropped , the phase @xmath355 due to the fictitious magnetic field disappears and the eigenenergies are given by the coupling of @xmath362 and @xmath363 , which has been also checked by the computational calculation .",
    "@xmath102 \" shift in momentum space appears at the boundary , modifying the pbc to anti - periodic bc , even if there is no intention to use apbc .",
    "of course , this is avoidable when the momentum @xmath285 is redefined as @xmath364 , as pointed out in koizumi et al .",
    "( 1998b ) . however , it is natural that the results for pbc are obtained in the calculation using pbc .",
    "thus , also from this technical viewpoint , it is recommended that the phase factor @xmath361 is added for the local rotation in the orbital space .    to show the last item of the list needed to show the stability of the ce state ( see before ) , it is necessary to include the effect of the magnetic coupling between adjacent @xmath35-spins .",
    "the appearance of the afm phase with the zigzag geometry can be understood by the competition between the kinetic energy of @xmath38 electrons and the magnetic energy gain of @xmath35 spins based on the double - exchange mechanism .",
    "namely , if @xmath238 is very small , for instance equal to zero , the fm phase best optimizes the kinetic energy of the @xmath38-electrons . on the other hand , when @xmath238 is as large as @xmath323 , the system stabilizes a g - type afm phase to exploit the magnetic energy of the @xmath35-spins . for intermediate values of @xmath238 , the afm phase with a zigzag structure can appear to take advantage at least partially of both interactions",
    "namely , along the fm zigzag chain with alignment of @xmath35-spins , the @xmath38-electrons can move easily , optimizing the kinetic energy , and at the same time there is a magnetic energy gain due to the antiferromagnetic coupling between adjacent zigzag chains .",
    "the  window \" in @xmath238 in which the zigzag afm phase is stabilized has been found to be around @xmath238@xmath3650.1@xmath323 in monte carlo simulations and the mean - field approximation , as discussed elsewhere in this review .    in summary , at x=0.5",
    ", the ce - type afm phase can be stabilized even without the coulombic and/or the jt phononic interactions , only with large hund and finite @xmath366 couplings .",
    "of course , those interactions are needed to reproduce the charge and orbital ordering , but as already mentioned in the above discussion , because of the special geometry of the one - dimensional zigzag fm chain , it is easy to imagine that the checkerboard type charge - ordering and @xmath303 orbital - ordering pattern will be stabilized . furthermore , the charge confinement in the straight segment ( sites 2 and 4 in fig.iii.e.7 ) , will naturally lead to charge stacking along the @xmath111-axis , with stability caused by the special geometry of the zigzag structure .",
    "thus the complex spin - charge - orbital structure for half - doped manganites can be understood intuitively simply from the viewpoint of its band - insulating nature .    * bi - stripe structure at x @xmath27 0.5 : *    in the previous subsection , the discussion focused on the ce - type afm phase at x=0.5 .",

    "then , let us try to consider the band - insulating phase for density x=2/3 based on @xmath269 ( as defined in sec.iii.c ) , without both the jt phononic and coulombic interactions , since this doping is quite important for the appearance of the bi - stripe structure , as already discussed in previous sections ( see mori et al .",

    "( 2000 ) , the lowest - energy state was found to be characterized by the straight path , not the zigzag one , leading to the c - type afm phase which was also discussed in previous sections ( for a visual representation of the c - type state see fig.4 of kajimoto et al . , 1999 ) . at first glance",
    ", the zigzag structure , for instance the @xmath368-type path , could be the ground - state for the same reason , as it occurs in the case of x=0.5 .",
    "however , while it is true that the state with such a zigzag structure is a band - insulator , the energy gain due to the opening of the bandgap is not always the dominant effect .",
    "in fact , even in the case of x=0.5 , the energy of the bottom of the band for the straight path is @xmath369 , while for the zigzag path , it is @xmath370 . for x=1/2 , the energy gain due to",
    "the gap opening overcomes the energy difference at the bottom of the band , leading to the band - insulating ground - state .",
    "however , for x=2/3 even if a band - gap opens the energy of the zigzag structure can not be lower than that of the metallic straight - line phase .",
    "intuitively , this point can be understood as follows : an electron can move smoothly along the one - dimensional path if it is straight . however",
    ", if the path is zigzag ,  reflection \" of the wavefunction occurs at the corner , and then a smooth movement of one electron is no longer possible .",
    "thus , for small numbers of carriers , it is natural that the ground - state is characterized by the straight path to optimize the kinetic energy of the @xmath38 electrons .",
    "however , in neutron scattering experiments a spin pattern similar to the ce - type afm phase has been suggested ( radaelli et al . , 1999 ) . in order to stabilize the zigzag afm phase to reproduce those experiments it is necessary to include the jt distortion effectively . as discussed in hotta et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , a variety of zigzag paths could be stabilized when the jt phonons are included .",
    "in such a case , the classification of zigzag paths is an important issue to understand the competing  bi - stripe \" vs.  wigner - crystal \" structures .",
    "the former has been proposed by mori et al .",

    "( 1999 ) . in the scenario by hotta",
    "et al.(2000 ) , the shape of the zigzag structure is characterized by the `` winding number '' @xmath371 associated with the berry - phase connection of an @xmath38-electron parallel - transported through jahn - teller centers , along zigzag one - dimensional paths .",

    ". then , the phase change in @xmath152 after moving through a couple of corners should be @xmath373 , leading to an increase of unity in @xmath371 .",
    "thus , the total winding number is equal to half of the number of corners included in the zigzag unit path .",
    "namely , the winding number @xmath371 is a good label to specify the shape of the zigzag one - dimensional fm path .",
    "after several attempts to include effectively the jt phonons , it was found that the bi - stripe phase and the wigner crystal phase universally appear for @xmath371=@xmath374 and @xmath371=1 , respectively .",
    "note here that the winding number for the bi - stripe structure has a remarkable dependence on x , reflecting the fact that the distance between adjacent bi - stripes changes with x. this x - dependence of the modulation vector of the lattice distortion has been observed in electron microscopy experiments ( mori et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the corresponding zigzag paths with the charge and orbital ordering are shown in fig.iii.e.9 . in the bi - stripe structure ,",
    "the charge is confined in the short straight segment as in the case of the ce - type structure at x=0.5 . on the other hand ,",
    "in the wigner - crystal structure , the straight segment includes two sites , indicating that the charge prefers to occupy either of these sites .",

    "a difference in the zigzag geometry can produce a significant different in the spin structure .",
    "following the definitions for the c- and e - type afm structures ( see wollan and koehler ( 1955 ) and introductory section of this review ) , the bi - stripe and wigner crystal structure have @xmath375-type and @xmath376-type afm spin arrangements , respectively .",
    "note that at x=1/2 , half of the plane is filled by the c - type , while another half is covered by the e - type , clearly illustrating the meaning of  ce \" in the spin structure of half - doped manganites .",

    "charge order at x@xmath3440.5 *    regarding densities smaller than 0.5 , the states at x=1/8 , 1/4 and 3/8 have received considerable attention recently ( see mizokawa et al . , 1999 ; korotin et al . , 1999 ;",
    "hotta and dagotto , 2000 ) .",
    "these investigations are still in a `` fluid '' state , and the experiments are not quite decisive yet , and for this reason , this issue will not be discussed in much detail here . however , without a doubt , it is very important to clarify the structure of charge - ordered states that may be in competition with the ferromagnetic states in the range in which the latter is stable in some compounds .",
    "`` stripes '' may emerge from this picture , as recently remarked in experiments ( adams et al .",
    ", 2000 ; dai et al . , 2000 ; kubota et al . ,",
    "see also vasiliu - doloc et al . , 1999 ) and calculations ( hotta , feiguin , and dagotto , 2000 ) , and surely the identification of charge / orbital arrangements at x@xmath260.5 will be an important area of investigations in the very near future .    here",
    "a typical result for this stripe - like charge ordering is shown in fig.iii.e.12 , in which the lower - energy orbital at each site is depicted , and its size is in proportion to the electron density occupying that orbital .",
    "this pattern is theoretically obtained by the relaxation technique for the optimization of oxygen positions , namely including the cooperative jt effect . at least in the strong electron - phonon coupling region ,",
    "the stripe charge ordering along the @xmath377 direction in the @xmath109-@xmath110 plane becomes the global ground - state .",
    "note , however , that many meta - stable states can appear very close to this ground state .",
    "thus , the shape of the stripe is considered to fluctuate both in space and time , and in experiments it may occur that only some fragments of this stripe can be detected .",
    "it should also be emphasized that the orbital ordering occurs concomitant with this stripe charge ordering . in the electron - rich region , the same antiferro orbital - order exists as that corresponding to x=0.0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the pattern around the diagonal array of electron - poor sites is quite similar to the building block of the charge / orbital structure at x=0.5 .",
    "if these figures are rotated by 45 degrees , the same charge and orbital structure is found to stack along the @xmath378-axis .",
    "namely , it is possible to cover the whole 2d plane by some periodic charge - orbital array along the @xmath128-axis ( see , for instance , the broken - line path ) . if this periodic array is taken as the closed loop @xmath379 in eq .",
    "( [ winding ] ) , the winding numbers are @xmath371=1 , 2 , and 3 , for x=1/2 , 1/3 , and 1/4 , respectively .",
    "note that in this case @xmath371 is independent of the path along the @xmath128-axis .",
    "a relation @xmath371=@xmath380 holds only when the 1d fm path is fixed in the afm spin arrangement .",
    "the results imply a general relation @xmath371=@xmath381 for the charge - orbital stripe in the fm phase , reflecting the fact that the distance between the diagonal arrays of holes changes with x. our topological argument predicts stable charge - orbital stripes at special doping such as x=@xmath382 , with @xmath371 an integer .",
    "this orbital ordering can be also interpreted as providing a ",
    "@xmath102\"-shift in the orbital sector , by analogy with the dynamical stripes found in cuprates ( see , for instance , buhler et al.(2000 ) ) , although in copper oxides the charge / spin stripes mainly appear along the @xmath109- or @xmath110-directions .",
    "the study of the similarities and differences between stripes in manganites and cuprates is one of the most interesting open problems in the study of transition metal oxides , and considerable work is expected in the near future .",
    "finally , a new zigzag afm spin configuration for x@xmath260.5 is here briefly discussed ( hotta , feiguin , and dagotto , 2000 ) . in fig.iii.e.13 , a schematic view of this novel spin - charge - orbital structure on the 8@xmath2328 lattice at x=1/4 is shown , deduced using the numerical relaxation technique applied to cooperative jahn - teller phonons in the strong - coupling region .",
    "this structure appears to be the global ground state , but many excited states with different spin and charge structures are also found with small excitation energy , suggesting that the afm spin structure for x@xmath260.5 in the layered manganites is easily disordered due to this `` quasi - degeneracy '' in the ground state .",
    "this result may be related to the `` spin - glass '' nature of the single layer manganites reported in experiments ( see moritomo et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the charge - orbital structure is essentially the same as that in the 2d fm phase ( see fig.iii.e.12 ) .",
    "this suggests the following scenario for the layered manganites : when the temperature is decreased from the higher temperature region , first charge ordering occurs due to the cooperative jahn - teller distortions in the fm ( or paramagnetic ) region .",
    "if the temperature is further decreased , the zigzag afm spin arrangement is stabilized , adjusting itself to the orbital structure .",
    "thus , the separation between the charge ordering temperature @xmath55 and the nel temperature @xmath383 occurs naturally in this context .",
    "this is not surprising , since @xmath55 is due to the electron - lattice coupling , while @xmath383 originates in the coupling @xmath238 .",
    "however , if the electron - phonon coupling is weak , then @xmath55 becomes very low . in this case , the transition to the zigzag afm phase may occur prior to the charge ordering . as discussed above ,",
    "the @xmath38 electron hopping is confined to one dimensional structures in the zigzag afm environment .",
    "thus , in this situation , even a weak coupling electron - phonon coupling can produce the charge - orbital ordering , as easily understood from the peierls instability argument .",
    "namely , just at the transition to the zigzag afm phase , the charge - orbital ordering occurs simultaneously , indicating that @xmath55=@xmath383 .",
    "note also that in the zigzag afm phase , there is no essential difference in the charge - orbital structures for the non - cooperative and cooperative phonons , due to the one - dimensionality of those zigzag chains .",
    "* iii.f pseudogap in mixed - phase states *    recent theoretical investigations suggest that the density of states ( dos ) in mixed - phase regimes of manganites may have `` pseudogap '' characteristics , namely a prominent depletion of weight at the chemical potential .",
    "this feature is similar to that extensively discussed in copper oxides .",
    "the calculations in the mn - oxide context have been carried out using both the one- and two - orbital models , with and without disorder ( see moreo , yunoki and dagotto , 1999b ; moreo et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "typical results are shown in fig.iii.f.1 .",
    "part ( a ) contains the dos of the one - orbital model on a 2d cluster varying the electronic density slightly below = 1.0 , as indicated in the caption . at zero temperature , this density regime is unstable due to phase separation , but at the temperature of the simulation those densities still correspond to stable states , but with a dynamical mixture of af and fm features ( as observed , for instance , in monte carlo snapshots of the spin configurations ) . a clear minimum in the dos at the chemical potential can be observed .",
    "very similar results appear also in 1d simulations ( moreo , yunoki and dagotto , 1999b ) .",
    "part ( b ) contains results for two - orbitals and a large electron - phonon coupling , this time at a fixed density and changing temperature .",
    "clearly a pseudogap develops in the system as a precursor of the phase separation that is reached as the temperature is further reduced .",
    "similar results have been obtained in other parts of parameter space , as long as the system is near unstable phase - separated regimes .",
    "a pseudogap appears also in cases where disorder is added to the system . in fig.iii.f.1c , taken from moreo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , results can be found for the case where a random on - site energy is added to the one - orbital model .",
    "a tentative explanation of this phenomenon for the case without disorder was described by moreo , yunoki , and dagotto ( 1999b ) , and it is explained in fig.iii.f.2 . in part ( a ) a typical mixed - phase fm - af state is sketched .",
    "shown are the localized spins . in the fm regions , the @xmath38-electrons improve their kinetic energy , and thus they prefer to be located in those regions as shown in ( b ) .",
    "the fm domains act as effective attractive potentials for electrons , as sketched in part ( c ) .",
    "when other electrons are added , fm clusters are created and new occupied levels appear below the chemical potential , creating a pseudogap ( part ( d ) of fig.iii.f.2 ) .",
    "the dos is clearly non - rigid .",
    "these results are compatible with the photoemission experiments by dessau et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for bilayer manganites .",
    "other features of the experiments are also reproduced such as the large width of the peaks , and the momentum independence of the results .",
    "this agreement adds to the notion pursued in this review that mixed - phase states are important to understand the behavior of manganese oxides .",
    "the reduction of the dos at the chemical potential is also compatible with the insulating characteristics of the bilayers in the regime of the photoemission experiments .",
    "it is conceivable that the manganites present a pseudogap regime above their curie and nel temperatures , as rich as that found in the cuprates .",
    "more details are given in the discussion section .",
    "* iii.g phase separation caused by the influence of disorder on first - order transitions : *    although it is frequently stated in the literature that a variety of chemical substitutions in manganites lead to modifications in the bandwidth due to changes in the `` average '' a - site cation radius @xmath384 , this statement is only partially true . convincing analysis of data and experiments by rodriguez - martinez and attfield ( 1996 )",
    "have shown that the disorder introduced by chemical replacements in the a - sites is also crucially important in determining the properties of manganites .",
    "for instance , rodriguez - martinez and attfield ( 1996 ) found that the critical temperature @xmath15 can be reduced by a large factor if the variance @xmath385 of the ionic radii about the mean @xmath384 is modified , keeping @xmath384 constant .",
    "rodriguez - martinez and attfield ( 1996 ) actually observed that maximum magnetoresistance effects are found in materials not only with a low value of @xmath384 ( small bandwidth ) but also a small value of @xmath385 .",
    "a good example is @xmath50 since the pr@xmath6 and ca@xmath7 ions are similar in size ( 1.30 @xmath85 and 1.34 @xmath85 , respectively , according to tomioka and tokura ( 1999 ) ) .",
    "disorder , as described in the previous paragraph , is important for the phase separation scenario .",
    "the recent experimental results showing the existence of micrometer size coexisting clusters in @xmath386 ( lpcmo ) by uehara et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , to be reviewed in detail later , highlights a property of manganites that appears universal , namely the presence of intrinsic inhomogeneities in the system , even in single crystals .",
    "this issue is discussed at length in various sections of this review . in the theoretical framework described thus far , the scenario that is the closest to predicting such inhomogeneous state is the one based on electronic phase separation .",
    "however , the analysis presented before when considering the influence of long - range coulomb interactions over a phase separated state , led us to believe that only nanometer size coexisting clusters are to be expected in this problem .",
    "those found in lpcmo are much larger , suggesting that there must be another mechanism operative in manganites to account for their formation .    a possible explanation of the results of uehara et al .",
    "( 1999 ) has been recently proposed by moreo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and it could be considered as a form of `` disorder - induced '' or `` structural '' phase separation , rather than electronic .",
    "the idea is based on the influence of disorder over the first - order metal - insulator ( or fm - af ) transition found in models where the interactions are translationally invariant ( without disorder ) , as it was described in sections iii.d and e. when such a transition occurs , abruptly a metal changes into an insulator , as either concentrations or couplings are suitably changed .",
    "unless metastable states are considered , there is no reason to assume that in the actual stable ground - state of this system coexisting clusters will be found , namely the state is entirely fm or af depending on parameters .",
    "however , different is the situation when disorder is considered into the problem . the type of disorder taken into account by moreo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is based on the influence of the different ionic radius of the various elements that compose the manganites , as discussed at the beginning of this section .",
    "depending on the environment of a - type ions ( which in lpcmo involve la , pr or ca ) a given mn - o - mn bond can be straight ( 180@xmath82 ) or distorted with an angle less than 180@xmath82 . in the latter , the hopping across the bond under study will be less than the ideal one . for a schematic representation of this idea see fig.iii.g.1 .",
    "the random character of the distribution of a ions , leads to a concomitant random distribution of hoppings , and also random exchange between the localized spins @xmath238 since this quantity is also influenced by the angle of the mn - o - mn bond .    to account for this effect , moreo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) studied the one- and two - orbital models for manganites described before , including a small random component to both the hoppings and @xmath238 .",
    "this small component did not influence the fm and af phases much away from their transition boundary , but in the vicinity of the first - order transition its influence is important .",
    "in fact , numerical studies show that the transition now becomes continuous , with fm and af clusters in coexistence in a narrow region around the original transition point .",
    "typical results are shown in fig.iii.g.2a-f , using one - dimensional clusters as an example .",
    "in the two upper frames , the energy versus @xmath238 ( or @xmath145 ) is shown at fixed values of the other couplings such as @xmath106 and @xmath123 , in the absence of disorder and at a fixed density x=0.5 .",
    "the abrupt change in the slope of the curves in ( a ) and ( d ) clearly shows that the transition is indeed first - order .",
    "this is a typical result that appears recurrently in all monte carlo simulations of manganite models , namely fm and af are so different that the only way to change from one to the other at low temperature is abruptly in a discontinuous transition ( and spin canted phases have not been found in our analysis in the absence of magnetic fields , as possible intermediate phases between fm and af ) .",
    "these results are drastically changed upon the application of disorder , as shown in frames ( b , c , e , and f ) of fig.iii.g.2 , where the mean couplings have been fixed such that the model is located exactly at the first - order transition of the non - disordered system . in these frames ,",
    "the nearest - neighbor spin correlations along the chain are shown .",
    "clearly this correlation is positive in some portions of the chain , while it alternates from positive to negative in others .",
    "this alternation is compatible with an af state , with an elementary unit cell of spins in the configuration up - up - down - down , but the particular form of the af state is not important in the following ; only its competition with other ordered states , such as the fm one is significant .",
    "the important point is that there are coexisting fm and af regions .",
    "the cluster size is regulated by the strength of the disorder , such that the smaller the disorder , the larger the cluster size .",
    "results such as those in fig.iii.g.2 have appeared in all simulations carried out in this context , and in dimensions larger than one ( see moreo et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "the conclusions appear independent of the particular type of af insulating state competing with the fm state , the details of the distribution of random numbers used , and the particular type of disorder considered which could also be in the form of a random on - site energy in some cases ( moreo et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "note that the coexisting clusters have the @xmath197 density , namely these are fm and af phases that appear at a fixed hole concentration in the non - disordered models , for varying couplings .",
    "then , the problem of a large penalization due to the accumulation of charge is not present in this context .    what is the origin of such a large cluster coexistence with equal density ?",
    "there are two main opposing tendencies acting in the system . on one hand , energetically it is not convenient to create fm - af interfaces and from this perspective a fully homogeneous system is preferable . on the other hand ,",
    "locally at the level of the lattice spacing the disorder in @xmath115 and @xmath238 alter the couplings such that the system prefers to be either on the fm or af phases , since these couplings fluctuate around the transition value . from the perspective of the disorder",
    ", the clusters should be as small as possible such that the local different tendencies can be properly accounted for . from this competition",
    "emerges the large clusters of fig.iii.g.2 , namely by creating large clusters , the number of interfaces is kept small while the local tendencies toward one phase or the other are partially satisfied .",
    "`` large '' here means substantially larger in size than the lattice spacing .",
    "a region where accidentally the distribution of random couplings favors the fm or af state on average , will nucleate such a phase in the form of a bubble .",
    "these simple ideas can be made more elegant using the well - known arguments by imry and ma ( 1975 ) , which were applied originally to the random field ising model ( rfim ) ( see contributions on the subject in the book of young ( 1998 ) ) , namely a model with a fm ising interaction among spins of a lattice in the presence of a magnetic field in the @xmath111-direction which changes randomly from site to site .",
    "this local field is taken from a distribution of random numbers of width 2@xmath39 . in the context of manganites",
    "it can be imagined that the spin up and down of the rfim represent the two states in competition ( metal and insulator ) in the real compounds .",
    "the random field represents the local tendency to prefer either a metal or an insulator , due to the fluctuations in the disorder of the microscopic models . as a function of an external uniform magnetic field",
    ", the rfim at zero temperature has a first - order transition at zero external field in the absence of random fields ( between all spins up and all down ) , which turns continuous as those random fields are added , quite similar to the case described above in the fm - af competition .",
    "then , the rfim captures at least part of the physics of mn - oxides that emerged from the study of realistic hamiltonians in the presence of disorder , as shown above . for this reason it is instructive to study this simple spin model , which can be analyzed on lattices much larger than those that can be reached with the one or two orbital models of section iii.c .",
    "however , note that the use of the rfim is only to guide the intuition , but it is not claimed that this model belongs to exactly the same universality class as the microscopic hamiltonians for mn - oxides used here .",
    "the study of universality is very complex and has not been addressed in this context yet .",
    "nevertheless , it is expected that the rfim will at least provide some intuition as to how real manganites behave .",
    "typical results are shown in fig.iii.g.3 . in part",
    "( a ) , the data corresponding to a simulation at low temperature on a 100@xmath232100 cluster for a fixed set of random fields is shown .",
    "the clusters are basically frozen , namely the result is representative of the ground - state .",
    "the presence of coexisting clusters of spins up and down is clear .",
    "their distribution is certainly random , and their shape fractalic , similar to that observed in experiments for lpcmo . upon reduction of @xmath39 , in frame ( b ) results now for",
    "a 500@xmath232500 cluster show that the typical size of the clusters grow and can easily involve a few hundred lattice spacings .",
    "when an external field is applied , a @xmath387 among disconnected clusters emerges .",
    "this is a very important point , in agreement with the expectations arising from several experiments , namely percolative characteristics should appear in real manganites to the extend that the theoretical investigations presented in this section are correct .",
    "uehara et al . ( 1999 ) and other experimentalists intuitively concluded that indeed percolation is important in the study of mn - oxides , and in the following section it will be shown that it plays a key role in rationalizing the d.c .",
    "resistivity of these compounds . gorkov and kresin ( 1998 ) also briefly discussed a possible percolation process at low temperature .",
    "summarizing , phase separation can be driven by energies other than purely electronic .",
    "in fact it can also be triggered by the influence of disorder on first - order transitions . in this case",
    "the competing clusters have the same density and for this reason can be very large .",
    "micrometer size clusters , such as those found in the rfim , are possible in this context , and have been observed in experiments .",
    "this result is very general , and should apply to a variety of compounds where two very different ordered states are in competition at low temperatures .",
    "the remarkable phenomenological results of rodriguez - martinez and attfield ( 1996 ) appear to be in qualitative agreement with the theoretical calculations . as explained above , moreo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that the size of the clusters induced by disorder near a transition , such as those produced by chemical substitutions in real manganites , which would be of first - order in the clean limit , can be controlled by the `` strength '' of that disorder . in practice",
    "this strength is monotonically related to @xmath385 ( in the limit @xmath135=0 there is no disorder ) . at small ( but not vanishing ) @xmath135 or disorder in the calculations of moreo",
    "et al . ( 2000 ) , the coexisting clusters are large . as the disorder grows , the clusters reduce their size . to the extent that the size of the coexisting clusters is directly proportional the strength of the cmr effect , then weak disorder is associated with large magnetoresistance changes with the composition , magnetic fields or pressure , a somewhat counter - intuitive result since naively strong disorder could have been expected to lead to larger modifications in the resistivity .    * iii.h resistivity of manganites in the mixed - phase regime : *    one of the main lessons learned from the previous analysis of models for manganites is that intrinsic inhomogeneities are very important in this context .",
    "it is likely that the real mn - oxides in the cmr regime are in such a mixed - phase state , a conclusion that appears inevitable based on the huge recent experimental literature , to be reviewed in the next section , reporting phase separation tendencies in some form or another in these compounds .",
    "however , note that until recently estimations of the d.c .",
    "resistivity @xmath52 in such a mixed - phase regime were not available .",
    "this was unfortunate since the interesting form of the @xmath52 vs. temperature curves , parametric with magnetic fields , is one of the main motivations for the current huge effort in the manganite context .",
    "however , the lack of @xmath388 estimations of @xmath52 is not accidental : it is notoriously difficult to calculate transport properties in general , and even more complicated in regions of parameter space that are expected to be microscopically inhomogeneous .",
    "although there have been some attempts in the literature to calculate @xmath52 , typically a variety of approximations that are not under control have been employed .",
    "in fact , the micrometer size of some of the coexisting clusters found in experiments strongly suggest that a fully microscopic approach to the problem will likely fail since , e.g. , in a computational analysis it would be very difficult to study sufficiently large clusters to account for such large scale structures .",
    "it is clear that a more phenomenological approach is needed in this context .",
    "for all these reasons , recently mayr et al .",
    "( 2000 ) carried out a study of @xmath52 using a @xmath389 @xmath390 @xmath391 model ( see kirkpatrick , 1973 ) , and other approximations .",
    "this model was defined on square and cubic lattices , but with a lattice spacing much larger than the @xmath392 distance between nearest - neighbor mn ions .",
    "a schematic representation is presented in fig.iii.h.1 .",
    "actually , the new lattice spacing is a fraction of micrometer , since the random network tries to mimic the complicated fractalic - like structure found experimentally . at each link in this sort of effective lattice , randomly either a metallic or insulating resistance was located in such a way that the total fraction of metallic component was @xmath83 , a number between 0 and 1 .",
    "the actual values of these resistances as a function of temperature were taken from experiments .",
    "mayr et al .",
    "( 2000 ) used the @xmath51 plots obtained by uehara et al .",
    "( 1999 ) corresponding to @xmath386 ( lpcmo ) , one of the compounds that presents the coexistence of giant fm and co clusters at intermediate values of the pr concentration . more specifically , using for the insulating",
    "resistances the results of lpcmo at y=0.42 ( after the system becomes a co state with increasing pr doping ) and for the metallic ones the results at y=0.0 ( which correspond to a metallic state , at least below its curie temperature ) , the results of a numerical study on a 100@xmath232100 cluster are shown in fig.iii.h.2 ( the kirchoff equations were solved by a simple iterative procedure ) .",
    "it is interesting to observe that , even using such a simple phenomenological model , the results are already in reasonable agreement with the experiments , namely , ( i ) at large temperature insulating behavior is observed even for @xmath83 as large as 0.65 ( note that the classical percolation is expected to occur near @xmath393 ; see kirkpatrick ( 1973 ) ) ; ( ii ) at small temperature a ( `` bad '' ) metallic behavior appears ; and ( iii ) a broad peak exists in between .",
    "results in both 2d and 3d lead to similar conclusions .",
    "it is clear that the experimental results for manganites can be at least partially accounted for within the mixed - phase scenario .",
    "the results of fig.iii.h.2 suggest a simple qualitative picture to visualize why the resistivity in mn - oxides has the peculiar shape it has .",
    "the relevant state in this context should be imagined as percolated , as sketched in fig.iii.h.3a , as predicted by the analysis of the previous section .",
    "metallic filaments from one side of the sample to the other exist in the system . at low temperature ,",
    "conduction is through those filaments . necessarily , @xmath52 at @xmath394=0 must be large , in such a percolative regime . as temperature increases , the @xmath52 of the filaments grows as in any metal .",
    "however , in the other limit of large or room temperature , the resistance of the percolated metallic filament is expected to be much larger than that corresponding to one of the insulator paths .",
    "actually , near room temperature in many experimental graphs , it can be observed that @xmath52 in the metallic and insulating regimes are quite similar in value , even comparing results away from the percolative region .",
    "then , at room temperature it is more likely that conduction will occur through the insulating portions of the sample , rather than through the metallic filaments .",
    "thus , near room temperature insulating behavior is expected . in between low and high temperature ,",
    "it is natural that @xmath52 will present a peak .",
    "then , a simple `` two resistances in parallel '' description appears appropriate ( see fig.iii.h.3b ) .",
    "the insulating resistance behaves like any insulator , while the metallic one starts at @xmath394=0 at a high value and then it behaves like any metal .",
    "the effective resistance shown in fig.iii.h.3b properly reproduces the experiments at least qualitatively .",
    "note , however , that many experimental results suggest that @xmath52 has an intermediate temperature peak sharper than shown in fig.iii.h.2 . in some compounds",
    "this is quite notorious , while in others the peak is fairly broad as in fig.iii.h.2 .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to find out alternative procedures to sharpen the @xmath52 peak to better mimic experiments .",
    "one possible solution to this problem is to allow for the metallic fraction @xmath83 to vary with temperature .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since it is known that the metallic portions of the sample in mixed - phase manganites originate in the ferromagnetic arrangement of spins that improves conduction .",
    "the polarization of the spins deteriorates as the temperature increases , and it is reasonable to imagine that the fm islands decrease in size as the temperature grows .",
    "then , a pattern of fm clusters that are connected at low temperature leading to a metallic behavior may become disconnected at higher temperatures .",
    "the tendencies toward a metallic percolation decrease with increasing temperature . such a conjecture was studied qualitatively by mayr et al .",
    "( 2000 ) using the random field ising model and the one - orbital model for mn - oxides . in both cases ,",
    "indications of the disappearance of percolation with increasing temperature were indeed found .",
    "then , assuming that @xmath83 decreases with increasing temperature , approximately following the magnetization , seems a reasonable assumption .",
    "results with a temperature dependent @xmath83 are shown in fig.iii.h.4 .",
    "the actual values of @xmath83 are indicated , at least in part , in the figure .",
    "certainly the peak is now sharper than in fig.iii.h.2 , as expected , and the results indeed resemble those found in a variety of experiments . note that the function @xmath83=@xmath395 has not been fine - tuned , and actually a variety of functions lead to similar conclusions as those in fig.iii.h.4 . note also that obtaining such a result from a purely microscopic approach would have been quite difficult , although mayr et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that data taken on small clusters using the one - orbital model are at least compatible with those of the phenomenological approach . to evaluate the conductance of these clusters ,",
    "the approach of datta ( 1995 ) and verges ( 1999 ) were used . also note that calculations using a cubic cluster with either metallic or insulating `` hopping '' ( avishai and luck , 1992 ) , to at least partially account for quantum effects , lead to results similar to those found in fig.iii.h.4 .",
    "the success of the phenomenological approach described above leads to an interesting prediction . in the random resistor network",
    ", it is clear that above the peak in the resistivity , the mixed - phase character of the system remains , even with a temperature dependent metallic fraction @xmath83 .",
    "then , it is conceivable to imagine that above the curie temperature in real manganites , a substantial fraction of the system should remain in a metallic fm state ( likely not percolated , but forming disconnected clusters ) .",
    "a large variety of experiments reviewed in the next section indeed suggest that having fm clusters above @xmath15 is possible . as a consequence ,",
    "this has led us to conjecture that there must exist a temperature @xmath0 at which those clusters start forming .",
    "this defines a new temperature scale in the problem , somewhat similar to the famous pseudogap @xmath0 scale of the high temperature superconducting compounds .",
    "in fact , in mixed phase fm - af states it is known that a pseudogap appears in the density of states ( section iii.g ; moreo et al . , 1999b ; moreo et al . , 2000 )",
    ", thus increasing the analogy between these two materials . in our opinion , the experimental verification that indeed such a new scale @xmath0 exists in manganites is important to our understanding of these compounds .",
    "in fact , recent results by kim , uehara and cheong ( 2000 ) for @xmath11 at various densities have been interpreted as caused by small fm segments of the ce - type co state , appearing at hole densities smaller than x=1/2 and at high temperature .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with the theoretical analysis presented here .",
    "the study of effective resistivities and conductances has also been carried out in the presence of magnetic fields ( mayr et al . , 2000 ) , although still mainly within a phenomenological approach . from the previous results figs.iii.h.2-4 ,",
    "it is clear that in the percolative regime `` small '' changes in the system may lead to large changes in the resistivity .",
    "for instance , if @xmath83 changes by only 5% from 0.45 to 0.5 in fig.iii.h.4 , @xmath52 is modified by two orders of magnitude !",
    "it is conceivable that small magnetic fields could induce such small changes in @xmath83 , leading to substantial modifications in the resistivity .",
    "experiments by parisi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) indeed show a rapid change of the fraction of the fm phase in @xmath396 upon the application of magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , studies of the one - orbital model carried out in one dimension ( mayr et al . , 2000 ) also showed that other factors may influence the large @xmath52 changes upon the application of external fields .",
    "for instance , in fig.iii.h.5 , the inverse conductance @xmath397 of a 64-site chain is shown in the presence of small magnetic fields ( in units of the hopping ) , in the regime of fm - af cluster coexistence , which is achieved by the introduction of disorder where a first - order fm - af transition occurs , as discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "the results of fig.iii.h.5 clearly indicate that @xmath397 can indeed change by several orders of magnitude in the presence of small fields even in a 1d system that certainly can not have a percolation .",
    "there must be some other mechanism at work in this context .",
    "mayr et al .",
    "( 2000 ) believe this alternative mechanism is caused by small modifications in the conductivity of the @xmath398 portions of the sample , independent of what occurs in the metallic clusters .",
    "it is possible that in an af region , with zero conductivity at large hund coupling due to the perfect anti - alignment of the nearest - neighbor @xmath35-spins , the small fields may induce a small canting effect that leads to a nonzero conductivity .",
    "while this effect should be negligible if the af phases is totally dominating , it may become more important if small af clusters separate fm ones .",
    "a sort of `` valve '' effect may occur , in other words magnetic fields can induce a small connection between metallic states leading to a substantial change in the resistivity .",
    "this idea can be studied qualitatively by simply altering by a small amount the conductivity of the insulating regions in the random - resistor - network .",
    "results are shown in fig.iii.h.5b , using the same functions @xmath83=@xmath395 employed before in fig.iii.h.4 .",
    "as anticipated , small conductivity changes lead to large resistivity modifications , comparable to those observed in experiments upon the application of magnetic fields .",
    "although the analysis discussed above is only semi - quantitative and further studies in magnetic fields should actively continue in this context , mayr et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have shown that in the percolative regime two mechanisms ( described above ) can lead to a large mr , leading to at least a possible framework for describing how the famous cmr effect can occur .",
    "* iii.i related theoretical work on electronic phase separation applied to manganites *    the possibility of `` electronic '' phase separation was already discussed by nagaev ( 1967 , 1968 , 1972 ) well before it became a popular subject in the context of compounds such as the high temperature superconductors .",
    "its original application envisioned by nagaev was to antiferromagnetic semiconductors , where the doping of electrons creates ferromagnetic - phase regions embedded in an af matrix .",
    "nagaev ( 1994,1995 ) remarked that if the two phases have opposite charge , the coulombic forces will break the macroscopic clusters into microscopic ones , typically of nanometer scale size , as remarked in this review before .",
    "when the number of these fm clusters is small , the system resembles a regular array of charge sort of a wigner crystal , as found also in the simulations of malvezzi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and the system remains an insulator .",
    "however , as the density grows , a transition will be found where the clusters start overlapping , and a metal is formed .",
    "although it may seem tempting to assign to this transition percolative properties , as nagaev does , note that at least without incorporating disorder the clusters are regularly spaced and thus the transition does not correspond to the usual percolative ones described in textbooks and in the previous subsection where the random position of the clusters play a key role .",
    "in particular , the critical density at which regularly spaced clusters begin overlapping triggers a process that occurs in all clusters at the same time , different from the notion of a percolative filament with fractalic shape which is crucial in percolative theories . for this reason it is unclear to these authors to what extend electronic phase separation",
    "can describe percolative physics in the absence of disorder .",
    "it appears that only when randomly distributed clusters of two phases are stabilized , as described in sec.iii.h , can true percolation occur .",
    "the calculations of nagaev ( 1994,1995,1996 ) have been carried out for one orbital models and usually in the limit where the hopping @xmath115 of the conduction electrons is much larger than the hund coupling ( although nagaev expects the results to qualitatively hold even in the opposite limit @xmath106@xmath27@xmath115 ) .",
    "also a low density of carriers was assumed , and many calculations were performed mainly for the one electron problem ( magneto polaron ) , and then rapidly generalized to many electrons . the formation of lattice polarons is not included in the approach of nagaev .",
    "these parameters and assumptions are reasonable for af semiconductors , and nagaev ( 1995 ) argued that his results can explain a considerable body of experimental data for euse and eute .",
    "however , note that mauger and mills ( 1984,1985 ) have shown that self - trapped fm polarons ( ferrons ) are @xmath62 stable in three dimensions . instead , mauger and mills ( 1984,1985 ) proposed that electrons bound to donor sites induce a ferromagnetic moment , and they showed that those bound magnetic polarons can account for the fm clusters observed in eute .",
    "free carriers appear `` frozen '' at low temperatures in these materials , and there are no ferron - like solutions of the underlying equations in the parameter range appropriate to eu chalcogenides .    in addition , note that the manganites have a large @xmath106 and a large density of electrons , and in principle calculations such as those described above have to be carried out for more realistic parameters , if the results can indeed apply to manganites .",
    "these calculations are difficult without the aid of computational techniques .",
    "in addition , it is clearly important to consider two orbitals to address the orbital - ordering of the manganites , the possibility of orbital phase separation , and the influence of jahn - teller or coulombic interactions that lead to charge - order af states .",
    "disorder also appears to play a key role in manganites .",
    "the unstable character of the low hole - density region of the phase diagram corresponding to the one - orbital model for manganites has also been analyzed by other authors using mostly analytic approximate techniques .",

    "nagaev ( 1998 ) using the one - orbital model also arrived at the conclusion that the canted af state of the small hole density region is unstable .",
    "the same conclusion was obtained in the work of kagan , khomskii and mostovoy ( 1999 ) where the dominance of phase separation in the small hole - density region was remarked upon , both using classical and quantum spins .",
    "ferromagnetic polarons embedded into an af surrounding were also discussed by those authors .",
    "polarons in electron - doped one - orbital models where also analyzed by batista et al .",
    "nagai , momoi and kubo ( 1999 ) using the dynamical mean - field approximation ( exact in infinite dimension ) studied the one - orbital model with @xmath107=1/2 localized spins .",

    "an af - pm phase separation was also detected in infinite dimension calculations ( yunoki et al . , 1998a ) , showing that not only af - fm coexistence is possible .",
    "calculations using @xmath115-@xmath144-like models , derived at large @xmath106 starting with the one - orbital model , also reveal phase separation , as shown by shen and wang ( 1998 ) .",
    "overall , it can be safely concluded that using a variety of numerical and analytical techniques , convincing evidence has accumulated that the canted af state of degennes ( 1960 ) is simply not stable in models believed to be realistic for manganese oxides .",
    "this state is replaced by a mixed - phase or phase - separated regime .",
    "the importance of heterogeneity in manganites was also remarked upon by von molnar and coey ( 1998 ) , based on an analysis of several experiments . also khomskii ( 1999 ) remarked upon the importance of phase - separation and percolation .",
    "other calculations have also shown tendencies to phase separation .",
    "for instance , yamanaka , koshibae and maekawa ( 1998 ) studied the one - orbital model in two and three dimensions and found phase separation between a flux and antiferromagnetic states ( see also agterberg and yunoki , 2000 ) . working with the one - orbital model , computational studies by yi and yu ( 1998 ) arrived to the same conclusions , previously presented by yunoki and moreo ( 1998 ) , regarding the presence of ps at both small and large hole density once the direct heisenberg coupling among the @xmath35 spins is considered .",
    "golosov , norman and levin ( 1998 ) , using a mean - field approximation for the one - band model , also found that the spin canted state was unstable , and indications of phase separation were reported .",
    "schlottmann ( 1999 ) using a simple alloy - analogy model showed that the system is unstable to phase separation .",
    "symmetry arguments discussed by zhong and wang ( 1999 ) also led to ps at low hole doping . in the continuum model ,",
    "ps has also been found ( roman and soto , 1998 ) .",
    "even for the two - orbital model , evidence has accumulated that phase separation is present , particularly at low- and high - density of holes . besides the already described robust computational evidence for the case where the orbital degree of freedom plays the key triggering role for this effect ( yunoki et al . ,",
    "1998b ) , mean - field approximations presented by okamoto , ishihara and maekawa ( 1999 ) also detected phase separation involving two phases with the same spin characteristics ( ferromagnetic ) , but differing orbital arrangement .",
    "a representative result is reproduced in fig.iii.i.2 , where the orbital states are also shown .",
    "* iii.j on - site coulomb interactions and phase separation : *    what happens with phase separation when the on - site coulomb @xmath142 interaction is dominant over other interactions ?",
    "this question does not have an easy answer due to the technical complications of carrying out reliable calculations with a nonzero @xmath142 .",
    "in fact , the one - band hubbard model has been studied for a long time as a model of high temperature superconductors and after more than 10 years of work it is still unclear whether it phase separates in realistic regimes of parameters .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that similar uncertainties may arise in the context of models for manganites .",
    "as remarked before , studies of the one - dimensional one - orbital model including a nonzero @xmath142 were carried out by malvezzi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in this study ,",
    "a region of phase separation was identified in a similar location as obtained in the monte carlo simulations without @xmath142 ( yunoki et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "then , certainly switching on @xmath142 `` slowly '' starting in the phase separated regime of the one - orbital model does not alter the presence of this regime .",
    "on the other hand , shen and wang ( 1999a ) claimed that if @xmath142 is made larger than @xmath106 , the model does not lead to phase separation according to their calculations ( see also gu et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "this issue is somewhat complicated by the well - known fact that pure hubbard - like models tend to present a large compressibility near half - filling , namely the slope of the curve density vs. chemical potential is large at that density ( dagotto , 1994 ) .",
    "this may already be indicative of at least a @xmath399 to phase separation that could be triggered by small extra terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that a two - orbital 1d model with a form resembling those studied in manganites ( but without localized spins ) indeed presents phase separation when studied using the dmrg technique ( hotta , malvezzi and dagotto , 2000 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of shen and wang ( 1999b ) using the two - orbital model at both large @xmath142 and @xmath106 , where it was concluded that having @xmath400 couplings leads to a rich phase diagram with phase - separated and charge - ordered states .",
    "it is likely that this conclusion is correct , namely phase separation may be weak or only incipient in the purely coulombic models , but in order to become part of the phase diagram , the hund coupling to localized spins may play a key role .",
    "more work is needed to clarify these issues . finally , the reader should recall the discussion of section iii.c , where at least within a mean - field approximation it was shown that a large electron - jt phonon coupling or large coulombic couplings are qualitatively equivalent .",
    "this is especially true when issues such as phase separation induced by disorder are considered , in which the actual origin of the two competing phases is basically irrelevant .",

    "dessau et al .",

    "the pseudogap affects the entire fermi surface , i.e. , there is no important momentum dependence in its value , making it unlikely that it is caused by charge , spin , or orbital ordering .",

    "these arpes results are in qualitative agreement with recent calculations by moreo , yunoki and dagotto ( 1999b ) and moreo et al .",

    "the conductivity was shown to be very small in these regimes ( moreo , yunoki and dagotto , 1999b ) , and a pseudogap appears in the density of states .",
    "it is possible that the low temperature region of the x=0.4 bilayer can be described in terms of a percolative process , and its reported `` spin canted '' character is simply caused by mixing af and fm phases .",
    "this rationalization also explains the large value of the resistivity even at low temperature .",

    "also perovskites such as @xmath457 have an interesting competition between af and fm states as x is varied . in fig.iv.h.2 the resistivity in the range of co densities where the transition occurs",
    "is shown , reproduced from kawasaki et al .",
    "the similarities with other results described in this review are clear .",
    "it is also important to mention here the large mr found in the _ pyrochlore _ compound @xmath458 , although it is believed that its origin maybe different from the analogous effect found in manganites ( ramirez and subramanian , 1997 and references therein .",
    "see also shimakawa , kubo , and manako , 1996 ; cheong et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "the behavior of the resistivity with temperature , parametric with the sc concentration and magnetic fields is shown in fig.iv.h.3 .",
    "the similarities with the analogous plots for the manganites presented in previous sections is clear . more work should be devoted to clarify the possible connection between pyrochlore physics and the ideas discussed in this review .",
    "diluted magnetic semiconductors also present characteristics of phase - separated states .",
    "ohno ( 1998 ) has recently reviewed part of the work in this context .",
    "the physics of magneto - polarons has also been reviewed before by kasuya and yanase ( 1968 ) .",
    "the reader should consult these publications and others to find more references and details about this vast area of research .",
    "diluted semiconductors have mobile carriers and localized moments in interaction . at low temperatures the spins",
    "are ferromagnetically aligned and the charge appears localized .",
    "it is believed that at these temperatures large regions of parallel spins are formed .",
    "the cluster sizes are of about 100 @xmath85 , a large number indeed ( see ohno et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "at a relatively small polaron density , their overlap will be substantial .",
    "important experimental work in this context applied to @xmath459 can be found in von molnar and methfessel ( 1967 ) .",
    "the resistivity vs temperature at several magnetic fields of @xmath460 is shown in fig.iv.h.4 , reproduced from shapira et al .",
    "the similarity with results for manganites is clear .",
    "other compounds of this family present interesting fm - af competitions .",
    "for instance , the phase diagram of @xmath461 presented by tarascon et al .",
    "( 1981 ) contains an intermediate region labeled with a question mark between the fm and af phases .",
    "this intermediate phase should be analyzed in more detail .",
    "already tarascon et al . ( 1981 ) favored an interpretation of this unusual region based on mixed - phase states .",
    "recently , two magnetically similar but electronically inequivalent phases were detected with nmr applied to eub@xmath118 by gavilano et al .",
    "also gavilano , hunziker and ott ( 1995 ) reported a two component nmr signal in * ceal@xmath462 * , signalling inhomogeneities in the material .",
    "clearly other compounds seem to present physics very similar to that found in manganites , at least regarding the fm - af competition .",
    "the diluted magnetic semiconductors have been rationalized in the past as having physics caused by magneto - polaron formation .",
    "however , larger clusters , inhomogeneities , and percolative processes may matter in these compounds as much as in manganites . actually , optical experiments by yoon et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have already shown the existence of strong similarities between manganites and eub@xmath118 .",
    "more recently , snow et al . ( 2000 ) presented inelastic light scattering measurements of euo and @xmath463 , as a function of doping , magnetic fields , and temperature .",
    "a variety of distinct regimes were observed , including a magnetic polaron regime above the curie temperature and a mixed fm / af regime at la density x larger than 0.05 .",
    "these eu - based systems do not have strong electron - lattice effects associated with jahn - teller modes .",
    "then , the existence of physical properties very similar to those of manganites show that the key feature leading to such behavior is the competition between different tendencies , rather than the origin and detailed properties of those competing phases .",
    "it is clear that further experimental work should be devoted to clarify these interesting issues .",
    "the authors of this review firmly believe that mixed - phase tendencies and percolation are not only interesting properties of manganites , but should be present in a large variety of other compounds as well .",
    "in this review , the main results gathered in recent years in the context of theoretical studies of models for manganites have been discussed .",
    "in addition , the main experiments that have helped clarify the physics of these interesting compounds have also been reviewed .",
    "several aspects of the problem are by now widely accepted , while others still need further work to be confirmed .",
    "intrinsic inhomogeneities exist in models and experiments and seem to play a key role in these compounds .",
    "0.5 cm    among the issues related with inhomogeneities that after a considerable effort appear well - established are the following :    * ( 1 ) * work carried out by several groups using a variety of techniques have shown that electronic phase separation is a dominant feature of models for manganites , particularly in the limits of small and large hole doping .",
    "this type of phase separation leads to nanometer size coexisting clusters once the long - range coulombic repulsion is incorporated into the models .    * ( 2 ) * working at constant density , the transitions between metallic ( typically fm ) and insulating ( typically co / af ) states are of * first * order at zero temperature .",
    "no counter - example has been found to this statement thus far .    * ( 3 ) * a second form of phase separation has been recently discussed .",
    "it is produced by the influence of disorder on the first - order metal - insulator transitions described in the previous item .",
    "a simple intuitive explanation is given in fig.v.1 . if couplings are fixed such that one is exactly at the first - order transition in the absence of disorder , the system is `` confused '' and does not know whether to be metallic or insulating ( at zero disorder ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the couplings are the same , but the strength of disorder is large in such a way that it becomes dominating , then tiny clusters of the two competing phases are formed with the lattice spacing as the typical length scale . for nonzero but weak disorder , an intermediate situation develops where fluctuations in the disorder pin either one phase or the other in large regions of space .",
    "this form of phase separation is even more promising than the electronic one for explaining the physics of manganites for a variety of reasons : ( i ) it involves phases with the same density , thus there are no constraints on the size of the coexisting clusters which can be as large as a micrometer in scale , as found in experiments .",
    "( ii ) the clusters are randomly distributed and have fractalic shapes , leading naturally to * percolative * transitions from one competing phase to the other , as couplings or densities are varied .",
    "this is in agreement with many experiments that have reported percolative features in manganites .",
    "( iii ) the resistivity obtained in this context is similar to that found in experiments , as sketched in fig.v.2 : near the critical amount of metallic fraction for percolation , at room temperature the charge conduction can occur through the insulating regions since their resistivity at that temperature is very similar to that of the metallic state .",
    "thus , the system behaves as an insulator .",
    "however , at low temperatures , the insulator regions have a huge resistivity and , thus , conduction is through the percolative metallic filaments which have a large intrinsic resistivity .",
    "the system behaves as a bad metal , and @xmath405 can be very large .",
    "( iv ) finally , it is expected that in a percolative regime there must be a high sensitivity to magnetic fields and other naively `` small '' perturbations , since tiny changes in the metallic fraction can induce large conductivity modifications .",
    "this provides the best explanation of the cmr effect of which these authors are aware .    *",
    "( 4 ) * the experimental evidence for inhomogeneities in manganites is by now simply overwhelming . dozens",
    "of groups , using a variety of techniques , have converged to such a conclusion .",
    "it is clear that homogeneous descriptions of manganites in the region of interest for the cmr effect are incorrect .",
    "these inhomogeneities appear even above the curie temperature .",
    "in fact , the present authors believe that a new scale of temperature @xmath0 should be introduced , as very roughly sketched in fig.v.3 .",
    "there must be a temperature window where coexisting clusters exist above the temperatures where truly long - range order develops .",
    "part of the clusters can be metallic , and their percolation may induce long - range order as temperature decreases .",
    "the region below @xmath0 can be as interesting as that observed in high temperature superconductors , at temperatures higher than the critical values .",
    "it is likely that it contains pseudogap characteristics , due to its low conductivity in low bandwidth manganites .",
    "the search for a characterization of @xmath0 should be pursued actively in experiments .    * ( 5 ) * the famous ce - state of half - doped manganites has been shown to be stable in mean - field and computational studies of models for manganites .",
    "although such a state was postulated a long time ago , it is only recently that it has emerged from unbiased studies .",
    "the simplest view to understand the ce - state is based on a `` band insulating '' picture : it has been shown that in a zigzag fm chain a gap opens at x=0.5 , reducing the energy compared with straight chains .",
    "thus , elegant geometrical arguments are by now available to understand the origin of the naively quite complicated ce - state of manganites .",
    "its stabilization can be rationalized based simply on models of non - interacting spinless fermions in 1d geometries .",
    "in addition , theoretical studies have allowed one to analyze the properties of the states competing with the ce at x=0.5 . in order to arrive at the ce - state ,",
    "the use of a strong long - range coulomb interaction to induce the staggered charge pattern is not correct , since by this procedure the experimentally observed charge - stacking along the @xmath111-axis could not be reproduced , and in addition the metallic regimes at x=0.5 found in some manganites would not be stable .",
    "manganese oxides are in the subtle regime where many different tendencies are in competition .    *",
    "( 6 ) * contrary to what was naively believed until recently , studies with strong electron jahn - teller phonon coupling or with strong on - site coulomb interactions lead to quite similar phase diagrams .",
    "the reason is that both interactions disfavor double occupancy of a given orbital .",
    "thus , if the goal is to understand the cmr effect , the important issue is not whether the material is jahn - teller or coulomb dominated , but how the metallic and insulating phases , of whatever origin , compete .",
    "calculations with jahn - teller phonons are the simplest in practice , and they have led to phase diagrams that contain most of the known phases found experimentally for manganites , such as the a - type af insulating state at x=0 , the a - type af metallic state at x=0.5 , the ce - state at x=0.5 , etc .",
    "such an agreement theory - experiment is quite remarkable and encouraging .    *",
    "( 7 ) * also contrary to naive expectations , the smallest parameter in realistic hamiltonians for mn - oxides , namely `` @xmath238 '' between localized @xmath35 spins , plays an important role in stabilizing the experimentally observed phases of manganites , including the ce - state .",
    "modifications of this coupling due to disorder are as important as those in the hopping amplitudes for @xmath38 electron movement .",
    "0.5 cm    in short , it appears that some of the theories proposed in early studies for manganites can already be shown to be incorrect .",
    "this includes ( i ) simple double exchange ideas where the high resistivity above @xmath15 is caused by the disordered character of the localized spins that reduce the conductivity in the @xmath38 band .",
    "this is not enough to produce an insulating state above @xmath15 , and does not address the notorious inhomogeneities found in experiments",
    ". it may be valid in some large bandwidth compounds away from the region of competition between metal and insulator .",
    "( ii ) anderson localization also appears unlikely to explain the experimental data .",
    "an unphysically large value of the disorder strength is needed for this to work at high temperature , the pseudogap found in photoemission experiments can not be rationalized in this context where the density of states is not affected by disorder , and large inhomogeneities , once again , can not be addressed in this framework .",
    "however , note that once a percolative picture is accepted for manganites , then some sort of localization in such a fractalic environment is possible .",
    "( iii ) polaronic ideas can explain part of the experimental data at least at high temperatures , far from the curie temperature .",
    "however , the region where cmr is maximized can not be described by a simple gas of heavy polarons or bipolarons ( see experimental results in section iv ) .",
    "there is no reason in the polaronic framework for the creation of micrometer size coexisting clusters in these compounds .",
    "actually , note that theories based on small polarons and phase separation do not differ only on subtle points if the phase separation involves microdomains .",
    "it may happen that nanometer phase separation leads to physics similar to that created by polaronic states , but certainly not when much larger clusters are formed .    as a conclusion , it is clear that the present prevailing paradigm for manganites relies on a phase - separated view of the dominant state , as suggested by dozens of experiments and also by theoretical calculations once powerful many - body techniques are used to study realistic models .",
    "0.6 cm    although considerable progress has been achieved in recent years in the analysis of manganites , both in theoretical and experimental aspects , there are still a large number of issues that require further work . here a partial list of * open questions * is included .    * ( a ) * the phase separation scenario needs further experimental confirmation .",
    "are there counterexamples of compounds where cmr occurs but the system appears homogeneous ?    * ( b ) * on the theory front , a phase - separated percolative state is an important challenge to our computational abilities .",
    "is it possible to produce simple formulas with a small number of parameters that experimentalists can use in order to fit their , e.g. , transport data ?",
    "the large effort needed to reproduce the zero magnetic field resistivity vs. temperature results ( reviewed here ) suggests that this will be a hard task .    * ( c )",
    "* it is believed that at zero temperature the metal - insulator transition is of first - order and upon the introduction of disorder it becomes continuous , with percolative characteristics .",
    "a very important study that remains to be carried out is the analysis of the influence of temperature on those results .",
    "these authors believe that the generation of a `` quantum critical point '' ( qcp ) is likely in this context , and preliminary results support this view ( burgy et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "the idea is sketched in fig.v.4 . without disorder ( part ( a ) )",
    ", the first - order transition survives the introduction of temperature , namely in a finite temperature window the transition between the very different fm and af states remains first - order .",
    "however , introducing disorder ( part ( b ) ) , a qcp can be generated since the continuous zero temperature transition is unlikely to survive at finite temperature at fixed couplings .",
    "the presence of such qcp would be a conceptually important aspect of the competition between fm and af phases in manganites .",
    "experimental results showing that the generation of such qcp is possible have already been presented ( tokura , 2000 ) .    *",
    "( d ) * there is not much reliable theoretical work carried out in the presence of magnetic fields addressing directly the cmr effect .",
    "the reason is that calculations of resistivity are notoriously difficult , and in addition , the recent developments suggest that percolative properties are important in manganites , complicating the theoretical analysis .",
    "nevertheless , the present authors believe that a very simple view of the cmr effect could be as follows .",
    "it is known that the metallic and insulating phases are separated by first - order transitions .",
    "then , when energy is plotted vs the parameter `` g '' that transforms one phase into the other ( it could be a coupling in the hamiltonian or the hole density ) , a level crossing occurs at zero temperature , as sketched in fig.v.5 . in the vicinity of the transition point",
    ", a small magnetic field can produce a rapid destabilization of the insulating phase in favor of the metallic phase .",
    "this can occur only in a small window of densities and couplings if realistic ( small ) magnetic fields are used . at present",
    "it is unknown how disorder , and the percolation phenomena it induces , will affect these sketchy results .",
    "in addition , there are compounds such as @xmath50 that present cmr in a large density window , suggesting that the simple picture of fig.v.5 can be a good starting point , but is incomplete .",
    "thus , quantitative calculations addressing the cmr effect are still needed .    *",
    "( e ) * does a spin - canted phase ever appear in simple models with competing fm and af phases in the absence of magnetic fields ?",
    "are the regions labeled as spin - canted in some experiments truly homogeneous or mixed - states ?    * ( f ) * if the prediction of a phase - separated state in the cmr regime of manganites is experimentally fully confirmed , what are the differences between that state and a canonical `` spin - glass '' ?",
    "both share complexity and complicated time dependences , but are they in the same class ? stated in more exciting terms , can the phase - separated regime of manganites be considered a `` new '' state of matter in any respect ?    * ( g ) * considerable progress has been achieved in understanding the x=0 and x=0.5 charge / orbital / spin order states of manganites . but little is known about the ordered states at intermediate densities , both in theory and experiments .",
    "are there stripes in manganites at those intermediate hole densities as recently suggested by experimental and theoretical work ?",
    "0.6 cm    summarizing , the study of manganites continues challenging our understanding of transition metal oxides .",
    "while considerable progress has been achieved in recent years , much work remains to be done .",
    "in particular , a full understanding of the famous cmr effect is still lacking , although evidence is accumulating that it may be caused by intrinsic tendencies toward inhomogeneities in mn - oxides and other compounds . work in this challenging area of research should continue at its present fast pace .",
    "the authors would like to thank our many collaborators that have helped us in recent years in the development of the phase separation scenario for manganites . particularly , the key contributions of seiji yunoki are here acknowledged .",

    "<S> the study of the manganese oxides , widely known as manganites , that exhibit the `` colossal '' magnetoresistance ( cmr ) effect is among the main areas of research within the area of strongly correlated electrons . </S>",
    "<S> after considerable theoretical effort in recent years , mainly guided by computational and mean - field studies of realistic models , considerable progress has been achieved in understanding the curious properties of these compounds . </S>",
    "<S> these recent studies suggest that the ground states of manganite models tend to be intrinsically inhomogeneous due to the presence of strong tendencies toward phase separation , typically involving ferromagnetic metallic and antiferromagnetic charge and orbital ordered insulating domains . </S>",
    "<S> calculations of the resistivity versus temperature using mixed states lead to a good agreement with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the mixed - phase tendencies have two origins : ( i ) electronic phase separation between phases with different densities that lead to nanometer scale coexisting clusters , and ( ii ) disorder - induced phase separation with percolative characteristics between equal - density phases , driven by disorder near first - order metal - insulator transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the coexisting clusters in the latter can be as large as a micrometer in size . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that a large variety of experiments reviewed in detail here contain results compatible with the theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the main phenomenology of mixed - phase states appears to be independent of the fine details of the model employed , since the microscopic origin of the competing phases does not influence the results at the phenomenological level . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is quite important to clarify the electronic properties of the various manganite phases based on microscopic hamiltonians , including strong electron - phonon jahn - teller and/or coulomb interactions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , several issues are discussed here from the microscopic viewpoint as well , including the phase diagrams of manganite models , the stabilization of the charge / orbital / spin ordered half - doped ce - states , the importance of the naively small heisenberg coupling among localized spins , the setup of accurate mean - field approximations , the existence of a new temperature scale @xmath0 where clusters start forming above the curie temperature , the presence of stripes in the system , and many others . however </S>",
    "<S> , much work remains to be carried out , and a list of open questions is included here . </S>",
    "<S> it is also argued that the mixed - phase phenomenology of manganites may appear in a large variety of compounds as well , including ruthenates , diluted magnetic semiconductors , and others . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that manganites reveal such a wide variety of interesting physical phenomena that their detailed study is quite important for progress in the field of correlated electrons .    </S>",
