    "dwarf galaxies make the largest contribution to galaxies by number and type ( e.g. , @xcite ) and are considered to be the building blocks in hierarchical scenarios of galaxy formation .",
    "being metal  poor , they represent the systems which have evolved least since the big bang .",
    "although some dwarf galaxies are exceedingly faint , they may contain large amounts of dark matter in proportion to their luminous masses .",
    "dwarf irregular galaxies ( dis ) , which are the focus of this paper , are characterized by an irregular visual appearance , large gas reservoirs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , low dust content ( e.g. , see review by @xcite ) , a lack of distinct spiral arms , and star formation scattered throughout the body of the galaxies ( see also reviews by @xcite ) .",
    "regions provide a way to judge the total metallicity , because measures of oxygen abundance within these  regions probe the most recent period of chemical enrichment ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "oxygen abundances within dis do not vary greatly with galactocentric radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) contain very bright central regions . here",
    ", dis are chosen for study over bcds , because the contribution of light from young stars in dis is much less than the light from the underlying old stellar population ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , dwarf ellipticals ( des ) and dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) have smoother visual appearances , mostly old stars , and low gas content .",
    "des and dsphs , respectively , are the bright and faint representatives of gas  poor dwarf galaxies in which star formation has ceased ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in all of these types of dwarf galaxies ,",
    "central surface brightness increases with increasing luminosity .",
    "it seems natural to consider a possible evolutionary relationship between dis and des / dsphs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is not yet well understood how dis could have evolved or transformed to become des / dsphs , as dis have bluer colours and lower surface brightnesses than luminous des / dsphs at a given luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) . moreover , while a relationship between iron abundance in stars and galaxy luminosity has been observed in nearby dsphs ( @xcite ) , @xcite and @xcite showed that oxygen abundances for a number of field dsphs are about @xmath10.3  dex higher than in field dis at similar luminosities and concluded that the predecessors of these nearby dsphs could not have been dis .",
    "owing to their relatively low gravitational potentials , dwarf galaxies are thought to be susceptible to internal blow  out of their gaseous contents ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although some claim that blow  out signatures of dwarf galaxies have not been definitively observed ( @xcite ) .",
    "this motivates careful study of the chemical properties of field dis , which have the potential to uncover the relevance of gas flows to evolution in isolation . with knowledge about the history of field dis ,",
    "it becomes possible to examine differentially the evolution of dis in clusters , and thereby pinpoint perturbations stemming from the different environments .",
    "a subsequent comparison with the virgo cluster is the subject of paper  ii @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",

    "[ sec_sample ] . observations and reductions are described in   [ sec_obs ] .",

    "the derived properties are listed in   [ sec_derivedprops ] .",
    "two key diagrams are used as diagnostics of di evolution : the oxygen abundance versus luminosity and the oxygen abundance versus baryonic gas fraction .",
    "a discussion of these diagnostics and how the gas and stellar constituents are used to define the gas fraction is presented in   [ sec_evolution ] .",
    "finally , the conclusions are given in ",
    "[ sec_concl ] .",
    "the sample of dis in the field compiled by @xcite is the starting point of research for this work .",
    "the sample is defined by two criteria : ( 1 ) oxygen abundances are determined directly from measurements of the  emission line , and ( 2 ) distances are determined from stellar properties following the prescription in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "table  [ table_fieldsample ] lists the field sample of 22 dwarf irregular galaxies along with their basic properties . a new addition to the sample is ddo  187 (   [ sec_ddo187 ] ) , which also satisfies the above criteria .    to establish the best possible parameters for the field sample ,",
    "the literature was searched for measurements more recent than those compiled by @xcite .",
    "direct oxygen abundances and well  determined distances were obtained from data given in papers describing emission  line spectroscopy and photometry of resolved stellar populations , respectively .",
    "tables  [ table_distupdate ] and [ table_specupdate ] , respectively , summarize the dwarf galaxies whose distances and oxygen abundances have been updated",
    ". of note also are updates to values of the  21cm flux @xcite for gr  8 , ic  1613 , ngc  1569 , and sextans  b.      distance measurements founded upon the observations of cepheid variable stars or the location of the tip of the red giant branch were preferred .",
    "distance determinations from cepheids are founded upon the cepheid calibration by @xcite , whose value of the distance modulus to the lmc was 18.50  mag .",
    "@xcite measured the geometric expansion of the ring in the supernova remnant sn1987a and derived a distance modulus of 18.58  mag .",
    "this value of the distance modulus to the lmc is adopted for the remainder of this work .",
    "values of distance moduli from cepheids are adjusted by @xmath2  mag to account for the revised distance to the lmc .",
    "@xcite showed that the absolute magnitude in @xmath3 of the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) , @xmath4 , is relatively constant , independent of metallicity and age , so long as the stars are generally metal  poor ( @xmath5 } \\la -0.7 $ ] dex ) and older than a few gyr .",
    "thus , measurements of @xmath4 for resolved galaxies are good gauges of distance . to account for modest variations in colour and metallicity in each galaxy , absolute magnitudes in @xmath3 of the trgb",
    "were obtained following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "distance moduli were derived from observed magnitudes in @xmath3 , corrected for extinction . in spite of the dispute regarding the range in distance moduli to the lmc , it is reassuring that distances obtained from trgb measurements @xcite are consistent with and independent of the distance derived from the sn1987a measurement .    for galaxies with more than one kind of observation , derived distance moduli were averaged . generally , the errors in distance moduli obtained from either cepheids or the trgb are about 0.2 mag . for the remaining galaxies in table  [ table_fieldsample ] with no recent updates in the literature since 1995 , distance moduli derived by richer & mccall are adjusted by @xmath6  mag , because the value for the distance modulus to the lmc used by @xcite was 18.372  mag .",

    "dynamical masses have been used in the past to gauge the gas fraction ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however",
    ", a difficulty with the dynamical mass is that it may be dominated by non",
    " baryonic dark matter , which does not participate in nucleosynthesis .",
    "moreover , dynamical masses are notoriously difficult to measure in dis , because random or turbulent motions can dominate over ordered or rotational motions , especially at low luminosities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "instead , it is more prudent to evaluate the gas fraction by estimating masses for the luminous components .",
    "the gas in dis is the raw material out of which stars and metals are formed and consists mostly of hydrogen and helium .",
    "the largest constituent of gas in dis is assumed to be neutral atomic hydrogen .",
    "the composition of gas in molecular form within dis remains mostly an unknown quantity ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although co is used to trace the molecular hydrogen content in galaxies , the conversion from co to h@xmath64 masses is uncertain , because there is much debate about the `` universality '' of the conversion factor .",
    "fortunately , molecular gas is not expected to contribute greatly to the total gas mass in dwarf galaxies , owing to low metallicities and low dust  to  gas ratios @xcite .",
    "finally , ionized gas contributes negligibly to the mass @xcite .",
    "the  mass in solar masses is given by the following equation @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the 21cm flux integral in jy  km  s@xmath67 and @xmath68 is the distance in mpc .",
    "accounting for helium and other metals , the total gas mass in solar masses is given by @xmath69 where @xmath49 is the fraction of the gas mass in the form of hydrogen , adopted to be 0.733 .",
    "the mass in stars , @xmath70 , is often computed from the product of the blue luminosity , @xmath71 , with an assumed constant stellar mass  to  light ratio , @xmath72 .",
    "however , this does not account for the possible contamination of the luminosity by bright star  forming regions , which may introduce significant variations in @xmath72 from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "the problem may be particularly severe for dis , because a star formation event of a given mass would have a proportionately larger effect on the light than it does in a giant spiral galaxy . to account for varying rates of star formation",
    ", computing the stellar mass requires a synthesis of stellar populations and it would be ideal to know the flux contributions by old and young stars across a large range of wavelengths .",
    "while some recent syntheses of stellar populations within dis have been founded upon broadband optical and near  infrared colours ( e.g. , @xcite ) , all that is widely available for colours of dis in the present work is @xmath18 .",
    "a method is briefly described below which yields an estimate for @xmath72 tailored to the particular mixture of young and old stars in a di .",
    "originally developed by m. l. mccall as part of a long  term investigation of the masses of galaxies , this method is described more fully in @xcite .",
    "stellar masses for field dis were derived by supposing that dis consist only of a `` young '' disk component and an `` old '' disk component .",

    "the method is exact if a burst is superposed upon an old population .",
    "a one  component formalism to compute the stellar mass from a `` typical '' @xmath72 is not as good as the two  component version , because the stellar mass  to  light ratio may depend on luminosity , and may even vary greatly from galaxy to galaxy at a given luminosity .",
    "@xcite has shown that the two  component method gives a tighter correlation between oxygen abundance and the gas mass fraction than the one  component method ; see also the discussion at the end of   [ sec_oxymu ] .",
    "the mass of stars is given by the sum of the mass in the young and old components @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 represent the stellar mass  to  light ratios for the young and old components , respectively , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 represent the luminosity contributions in @xmath59 from the young and old components , respectively .",

    "it is simply evidence of a relationship between metallicity and a parameter that depends upon luminosity . for closed box evolution , that parameter could be ( a ) the average star formation rate , if all dis have been forming stars for the same length of time , or ( b ) the star formation time scale , if all dis have been forming stars at the same average rate , or ( c ) some combination of the two for more complicated star formation scenarios .",
    "recent studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) have shown that stars in dwarf irregulars have formed steadily but slowly .",
    "since the metallicity - gas fraction diagram suggests that field dwarfs have not suffered from extreme flows of gas , then one would conclude that the metallicity - luminosity relation is a consequence of variations in the time scale for star formation .",

    "it is worthwhile examining the ingredients of the algorithm to determine the robustness of the conclusion that field dis have evolved as closed systems .",
