    "let @xmath8 be a simple arrangement formed by @xmath0 hyperplanes in dimension @xmath1 .",
    "we recall that an arrangement is called simple if @xmath9 and any @xmath1 hyperplanes intersect at a distinct point .",
    "the closures of connected components of the complement of the hyperplanes forming @xmath10 are called the cells , or @xmath1-faces , of the arrangement . for @xmath11 ,",
    "the @xmath12-faces of @xmath10 are the @xmath12-faces of its cells .",
    "a facet is a @xmath13-face of @xmath8 , and a facet belonging to exactly one bounded cell is called an external facet .",
    "equivalently , an external facet is a bounded facet which belongs to an unbounded cell . for @xmath14 ,",
    "an external @xmath12-face is a @xmath12-face belonging to an external facet .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the number of external @xmath12-faces of @xmath10 .",
    "the set of all external facets forms the envelope of the arrangement .",
    "it was hypothesized in  @xcite that any simple arrangement @xmath8 has at least @xmath2 external facets . in section  [ 2d ] , we show that a simple arrangement of @xmath0 lines has at least @xmath4 external facets for @xmath16 , and that this bound is tight . in section  [ 3d ] , we show that a simple arrangement of @xmath0 planes has at least @xmath6 external facets for @xmath17 , and exhibit a simple plane arrangement with @xmath7 external facets . for polytopes and arrangements",
    ", we refer to the books of edelsbrunner  @xcite , grnbaum  @xcite and ziegler  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "[ ext2dlb ] for @xmath16 , a simple line arrangement has at least @xmath4 external facets .",
    "the external vertices of a line arrangement can be divided into three types , namely @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , corresponding to external vertices respectively incident to 2 , 3 , and 4 bounded edges .",
    "let us assign to each external vertex @xmath21 a weight of 1 and redistribute it to the 2 lines intersecting at @xmath21 the following way : if @xmath21 is incident to exactly 1 unbounded edge , then give weight 1 to the line containing this edge , and weight 0 to the other line containing @xmath21 ; if @xmath21 is incident to @xmath22 or @xmath23 unbounded edges , then give weight @xmath24 to each of the @xmath22 lines intersecting at @xmath21 .",
    "see figure  [ fig_weight_distribution ] for an illustration of the weight distribution .",
    "a total of @xmath25 weights is distributed and we can also count this quantity line - wise .",
    "the end vertices of a line being of type @xmath18 or @xmath19 , we have three types of lines , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , according to the possible types of their end - vertices .",
    "as a line of type @xmath27 contains @xmath22 vertices of type @xmath19 , its weight is at least @xmath22 .",
    "similarly the weight of a line of type @xmath28 weight is at least @xmath29 . remarking that a line of type @xmath30 contains at least one vertex of type @xmath20 yields that the weight of a line of type @xmath30 is at least @xmath31 . for @xmath16",
    "the number of lines of type @xmath28 is at most 2 as otherwise the envelope would be convex which is impossible , see for example  @xcite .",
    "therefore , counting the total distributed weight line - wise , we have @xmath32 .",
    "since for a line arrangement the number of external facets @xmath33 is equal to the number of external vertices @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 .          for @xmath16 ,",
    "consider the following simple line arrangement : @xmath36 is made of the @xmath22 lines @xmath37 and @xmath38 forming , respectively , the @xmath39 and @xmath40 axis , and @xmath41 lines defined by their intersections with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we have @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a constant satisfying @xmath48 .",
    "see figure  [ a072 ] for an arrangement combinatorially equivalent to @xmath49 .",
    "one can easily check that @xmath49 has @xmath4 external facets and therefore the lower bound given in proposition  [ ext2dlb ] is tight .    for @xmath16 ,",
    "the minimum possible number of external facets of a simple line arrangement is @xmath4 .",
    ", height=377 ]",
    "let @xmath50 for @xmath51 be the planes forming the arrangement @xmath52 . for @xmath51 , the external vertices of the line arrangement @xmath53 are external vertices of the plane arrangement @xmath52 . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the line arrangement @xmath53 has at least @xmath54 external facets by proposition  [ ext2dlb ] , i.e. , at least @xmath54 external vertices .",
    "since an external vertex of @xmath52 belongs to 3 planes , it is counted three times . in other words ,",
    "the number of external vertices of @xmath52 satisfies @xmath55 for @xmath17 . as the union of all of the bounded cells is a piecewise linear ball ,",
    "see  @xcite , the euler characteristic of the boundary gives @xmath56 .",
    "since an external vertex belong to at least 3 external edges , we have @xmath57 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath58 . as @xmath55 , it gives @xmath59      for @xmath17 , we consider following simple plane arrangement : @xmath60 is made of the @xmath61 planes @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath62 corresponding , respectively , to @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and @xmath66 planes defined by their intersections with the @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath67 axis .",
    "we have @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath47 is a constant satisfying @xmath75 .",
    "see figure  [ a073 ] for an illustration of an arrangement combinatorially equivalent to @xmath76 where , for clarity , only the bounded cells belonging to the positive orthant are drawn .",
    "we first check by induction that the arrangement @xmath77 formed by the first @xmath0 planes of @xmath78 has @xmath79 external facets .",
    "the arrangement @xmath77 is combinatorially equivalent to the plane cyclic arrangement which is dual to the cyclic polytope , see  @xcite for combinatorial properties of the ( projective ) cyclic arrangement in general dimension . see figure  [ a63 ] for an illustration of @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath81 denote the half - space defined by @xmath62 and containing the positive orthant , and @xmath82 the other half - space defined by @xmath62 .",
    "the union of the bounded cells of @xmath83 in @xmath82 is combinatorially equivalent to the bounded cells of @xmath84 and therefore has @xmath85 facets on its boundary by induction hypothesis , including @xmath86 bounded facets contained in @xmath62 .",
    "these @xmath86 bounded facets also belong to a bounded cell of @xmath83 in @xmath82 and therefore are not external facets of @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the number of external facets of @xmath83 belonging to a bounded cell in @xmath82 is @xmath87 .",
    "the union of the bounded cells of @xmath83 in @xmath81 can be viewed as a simplex cut by @xmath88 sliding down planes .",
    "it has @xmath89 facets on its boundary , including the @xmath86 bounded facets contained in @xmath62 belonging to a bounded cell of @xmath83 in @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the number of external facets of @xmath83 belonging to a bounded cell in @xmath81 is @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , @xmath83 has @xmath91 external facets .",
    "we now consider how the addition of @xmath92 to @xmath84 impacts the number of external facets .",
    "this impact is similar in nature to the addition of @xmath92 to the first @xmath93 lines of @xmath36 .",
    "the addition of @xmath92 creates @xmath94 new bounded cells : one above @xmath37 that we call the _ @xmath0-shell _ , and the other ones being below @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath0-shell turns @xmath88 external facets of @xmath84 above @xmath37 into internal facets of @xmath60 , and adds 3 external facets .",
    "for each external facet of @xmath84 belonging to @xmath37 which is turned into an internal facet of @xmath60 , one external facet of @xmath60 on @xmath92 and not incident to @xmath37 is added .",
    "below @xmath37 , the addition of @xmath92 creates @xmath95 new external facets of @xmath60 with an edge on @xmath37 .",
    "finally , @xmath88 new external facets belonging to @xmath37 and bounded by @xmath92 are created from unbounded facets of @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the total number of external facets of @xmath96 is @xmath97 .",
    "we do not believe that @xmath98 minimizes the number of external facets . among the 43 simple combinatorial types of arrangements formed by 6 planes ,",
    "the minimum number of external facets is @xmath99 while @xmath100 has 23 external facets .",
    "see figure  [ a63_29 ] for an illustration of the combinatorial type of one of the two simple arrangements with @xmath101 planes having 22 external facets .",
    "the far away vertex on the right and 3 bounded edges incident to it are cut off ( same for the far away vertex on the left ) so the 10 bounded cells of the arrangement appear not too small .",
