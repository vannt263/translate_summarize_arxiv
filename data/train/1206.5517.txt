    "in this paper gravitational effects as perturbations of the kepler problem are examined with post - newtonian approximation .",
    "gravitational effects become strong when the components of the binary are close to each other , and the orbital separation is small .",
    "the kepler problem is singular when the separation is zero , therefore to study gravitational effects the desingularization  or regularization  of the equation of motion would be a substantial step .",
    "it is well known that kustaanheimo ( 1964 ) solved the regularization of the three - dimensional kepler problem with spinors@xcite , which was reformulated by stiefel@xcite . in their method  the ks method for short  the regularization was carried out in four dimensions , and it was proved that the three - dimensional kepler problem can only be regularized using four - dimensional linear spaces .",
    "we follow another approach developed by j. vrbik . in his work",
    "the mentioned four - dimensional space is the linear space of quaternions and the regularization is calculated with quaternion algebra .",
    "he applied his method with success to the lunar problem@xcite , and several perturbative forces were studied in details@xcite .    in the present work we use his method to examine gravitational effects analytically with quaternions .",
    "the leading order correction of general relativity to classical mechanics is calculated first .",
    "the formula for the precession of the pericentre is derived based on the vrbik s quaternion formulae .",
    "then the gravitational radiation reaction is analyzed , where the famous peters - mathews formula is proved@xcite . in this calculation",
    "we manage to remove the residual coordinate gauge freedom of the gravitational reaction from the quaternionic equation of motion . in addition using a one - dimensional model we demonstrate that the regularization can lead to different results depending on that the sundman transformation is employed with the perturbed or unperturbed orbital separation .",
    "the regularization is defined with four - dimensional spaces , thus an additional geometrical constraint  a gauge  have to be applied to describe the three - dimensional spatial kepler problem . in the ks method",
    "the so - called _ bilinear relation _ is defined , which is an excellent gauge for _ numerical _ calculations .",
    "vrbik proposes another constraint to provide an _ analytic _ perturbative method , since  according to vrbik ",
    "the bilinear relation is too restrictive to build an analytic perturbative method .",
    "this constraint is the major difference between the ks method and vrbik s work .",
    "the laplace vector is a constant of motion of the kepler problem , which is a consequence of the hidden symmetry of the problem@xcite .",
    "this symmetry becomes manifest in four dimensions , which shows that the kepler problem has another interesting connection with the four - dimensional space .",
    "this connection has far reaching consequences@xcite .",
    "quaternions were first applied to regularize the kepler problem by chelnokov who successfully regularized the kepler problem to describe rotating coordinate systems@xcite .",
    "moreover he was able to apply his results to describe the optimal control problem of a spacecraft@xcite .",
    "later it was shown by vivarelli ( 1983 ) in a general mathematical sense that the ks method can be transformed identically into quaternion algebra@xcite .",
    "quaternion algebra proved to be very useful to derive the central ideas of the ks method .",
    "remarkably the bilinear relation is described as a fibration of the quaternion space .",
    "more recently waldvogel showed that the spatial kepler motion can be elegantly formulated with quaternions using a novel star conjugation operator@xcite .",
    "the star conjugation is especially useful to handle the bilinear relation .",
    "the interesting connection with the birkhoff transformation is also shown @xcite .",
    "quaternions turned to be useful in case of three and n - body applications@xcite .",
    "it has to be emphasized that the mentioned quaternion approaches _ exclusively _ apply the  bilinear relation \" as a gauge to reduce the dimensions from four to three , while vrbik apply his special gauge .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : a short outline of vrbik s approach is provided in section [ regularization with quaternion ] and [ orbitalelementswithquaternions ] , where we describe the transformation of the kepler problem into quaternion differential equation .",
    "then the solution is given in terms of ordinary differential equations of orbital elements .",
    "the advantages of vrbik s calculus compared with the ks method are highlighted .    in section  [ examplefortheregularization ]",
    "a one - dimensional example is given where we demonstrate that the result of the regularization depends on whether the sundman transformation is applied with perturbed or unperturbed orbital separation .    in section  [ grperturbations ] vrbik s method is applied to two perturbations .",
    "first of all , the leading order correction of general relativity to classical mechanics is examined .",
    "the formula for the precession of the pericentre is derived .",
    "then the gravitational radiation reaction is analyzed , where the famous peters - mathews formula is proved using the quaternion approach @xcite . in this calculation",
    "we solved to cancel the residual coordinate gauge freedom of the gravitational radiation reaction in the quaternionic equation of motion .",
    "the conclusion and the outlook is given in section  [ conclusion ] followed by the appendix .",
    "the quaternion algebra has three imaginary units , generally called @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "any of them anticommute @xmath4 while the real unit 1 commutes with each of them .",
    "the four units together form the algebra s generators .",
    "thus any element of the algebra can be written as components . ]",
    "@xmath5 quaternion _ conjugation _ reverses the sign of the imaginary units @xmath6 the _ magnitude _ of a quaternion is defined as @xmath7    any quaternion can be written in the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the magnitude and @xmath10 is the unit direction of @xmath11 . since @xmath12 the exponential on any quaternion can be expressed with euler s formula @xmath13      spatial vectors are represented with _",

    "it is straightforward to show that a rotation around the vector @xmath19 with magnitude @xmath20 can be written as@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "note that @xmath23 , hence @xmath24 is the inverse rotation .",
    "let us suppose that the rotation is parameter dependent @xmath25 , and differentiate it with respect to @xmath26 @xmath27 where definition ( [ rotationsingeneral ] ) of @xmath28 was applied . with the help of the identity @xmath29 and the cross product ( [ crossproduct ] ) this can be further written @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "consequently @xmath32 is the instantaneous angular velocity of @xmath28 with respect to @xmath26 . with an inverse rotation",
    "the angular velocity @xmath32 can be expressed in a special coordinate system  in the _ kepler frame _  where @xmath28 is instantaneously at rest @xmath33 where the subscript indicates the kepler frame .",
    "equipped with the quaternion formulae we turn to regularize the kepler problem with quaternions . the perturbed kepler problem in the @xmath34 system is given by the equation @xmath35where",
    "@xmath36 is the orbital separation vector of the orbiting bodies @xmath37@xmath38 is the small parameter of the perturbation , and @xmath39 is the sum of the two masses .    to regularize the kepler problem the separation is defined by the following _ quaternionic _ equation @xmath40where @xmath41 is a general quaternion .",
    "the conjugate of @xmath36 is @xmath42 where the @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 properties were used .",
    "therefore @xmath36 has no real part and can be written as @xmath46 . a direct calculation from ( [ transformation of the location ] )",
    "tells us that @xmath47 and the real part @xmath48 indeed vanishes .",
    "the obtained transformation ( [ kstransformation ] ) is just the ks transformation with the @xmath49 convention .",
    "@xcite    transformation ( [ transformation of the location ] ) maps the four - dimensional quaternion space into the three - dimensional space of spatial vectors .",
    "therefore the solution to a given three - dimensional @xmath36 in terms of four - dimensional @xmath50 is not unique . from ( transformation of the location )",
    "it is clear that the transformation @xmath51where @xmath52 is an arbitrary real number , is a continuous symmetry of ( transformation of the location ) .",
    "it follows that we have a one - dimensional compact manifold ",
    "a fibre  of @xmath50s for a given @xmath36 , and ( [ gauge transformation ] ) defines a fibration of the space of @xmath53s .",
    "the geometrical background of this transformation is elegantly described in waldvogel ( 2005 ) @xcite .",
    "this additional degree of freedom will be constrained in a careful manner .    to complete the regularization",
    "the time has to be also transformed .",
    "the _ sundman transformation _ is given by    @xmath54    where @xmath26 is the modified time and @xmath9 is a real and at this point _",
    "arbitrary _ function of @xmath26 ( it will be chosen such that it simplifies the solution ) . from now the operator @xmath55 indicates differentiation with respect to the modified time @xmath26 .    inserting the definition of the orbital separation ( [ transformation of the location ] ) into the equation of motion ( [ equation of perturbed motion ] ) while transforming the original time into the modified one using ( transformation of the time ) lead us to the following quaternionic differential equation @xcite    @xmath56    where @xmath57which is a scalar in the sense that it is invariant under conjugation .",
    "this quantity is the four - dimensional scalar product of the tangent vector of the @xmath58 curve and the tangent of the fibre at that point multiplied by two in ( @xmath59 ) with respect to @xmath60 which produces the tangent of the fiber and then taking the four - dimensional scalar product with @xmath61 . ] .",
    "let us define a condition @xmath62which means that the trajectory @xmath63 intersects the fibres under right angles .",
    "it is indeed a condition as transforming @xmath50 with symmetry transformation ( [ gauge transformation ] ) @xmath64 transforms as @xmath65 hence condition ( [ kscondition ] ) can be satisfied by solving a first order differential equation for @xmath66 .",
    "the geometrical constraint  ( [ kscondition ] ) is equivalent with the so - called  _ bilinear relation _ \" , which plays an essential role in the ks method@xcite .",
    "it can be proved that  ( [ gauge transformation ] ) is a dynamical symmetry , since the transformed @xmath67 solves the equation of motion .",
    "furthermore if condition ( [ kscondition ] ) is satisfied then @xmath68 also vanishes , which means that one can maintain this condition by finding the proper initial conditions @xmath69 and @xmath70 which satisfy the  bilinear relation \"  ( [ kscondition])@xcite .",
    "the unperturbed situation with condition ( kscondition ) reduces the perturbed equation of motion ( [ regularized equation of motion ] ) to the following equation @xmath71 the coefficient of @xmath50 is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a constant of motion .",
    "let us fix the parameter @xmath9 @xmath74 which means that @xmath9 is the semimajor axis of the elliptical motion . with this choice",
    "the equation of motion is the harmonic oscillator with _ constant _",

    "the general solution of this second order differential quaternion equation has six free parameters as it is constrained with ( [ kscondition ] ) and has a redundant phase ( [ gauge transformation ] ) .",
    "the trial solution of the unperturbed case can be parametrized as follows @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 with @xmath80 . in the next paragraph",
    "it is shown that the trial solution describes an elliptical kepler orbit .",
    "let us set @xmath81 for the moment and substitute @xmath82 into the definition of the separation ( [ transformation of the location ] ) @xmath83 where @xmath84 and the identity @xmath85 was applied .",
    "this formula can be further expanded using the @xmath86 identity @xmath87 which means that according to ( [ unitsaxis ] ) @xmath88 describes the following parametric curve @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "these equations describe an ellipse in the @xmath91 coordinate - plane , with semimajor axis @xmath9 , and eccentricity @xmath92 . from equations ( [ kepler_orbit ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath93 parametrizes the apocenter , thus @xmath94 is equivalent with the eccentric anomaly , except that the latter is zero at the pericenter .",
    "this tells us that @xmath95 is the time advance of apocenter passage measured in modified time . in the general case",

    "despite of the great advantages of the gauge condition ( [ kscondition ] ) - which is especially fine for numerical calculations - for perturbative calculations another geometrical condition is proposed .",
