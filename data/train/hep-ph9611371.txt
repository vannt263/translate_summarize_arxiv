    "non - conservation of baryon and lepton numbers , in particular proton decaying into leptons , is one of the hallmarks of grand unification @xcite . in this context , other forms of baryon and lepton non - conservation could be permitted as well  such as neutrinoless double beta decay and neutron - anti - neutron oscillation @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , experimental searches for any of these processes have not yet produced a positive result @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is known that some form of violation of baryon and/or lepton number must have occurred in the early universe to account for the observed excess of baryons over anti - baryons @xcite , which is in fact crucial to the origin of life .",
    "in addition , as discussed below , violation of at least lepton number is strongly suggested by recent neutrino - oscillation experiments @xcite , which indicate non - vanishing but light masses for the neutrinos . from a purely theoretical viewpoint , to be presented in the following ,",
    "it turns out that for a number of grand unified as well as superstring - derived models , observation of proton decay , into modes such as @xmath8 and/or @xmath2 , should be within the reach of current and forthcoming experimental facilities .",
    "it thus seems most encouraging and timely that superkamiokande , with the capability to improve the sensitivity of previous facilities - with respect to searches for both proton decay and neutrino - oscillations  by more than an order of magnitude , has just been turned on ; and new facilities like sno and icarus , as well as those designed to search for neutrino - less double beta decay and @xmath9 oscillations with improved sensitivity are expected to be available in the near future .    on the theoretical front , the original motivation for a unity of the fundamental forces and that for questioning baryon and lepton - number conservation laws in the context of such unification ideas @xcite have remained unaltered .",
    "but the perspective with regard to both issues has changed significantly over the last two - and - a - half decades , owing to the introduction of the ideas of supersymmetry @xcite and superstrings @xcite . in particular , supersymmetry , which seems to be an essential ingredient for higher unification ( see discussion in sec .",
    "5 ) poses the problem of rapid proton decay .",
    "this is because , in accord with the standard model gauge symmetry @xmath10 , a supersymmetric theory in general permits , in contast to non - supersymmetric ones , dimension 4 and dimension 5 operators which violate baryon and lepton numbers @xcite .",
    "thus , unless these operators are suppressed to the extent needed ( see discussions later ) , they pose the danger of unacceptably rapid proton decay .",
    "it turns out that obtaining a natural solution to this problem gets even harder if one wishes to obtain at the same time non - vanishing but light masses for the neutrinos ( @xmath11 few ev)@xcite",
    ".    bearing these issues in mind , i will first present here a brief summary of the status of non - supersymmetric and supersymmetric grand unificiation , and next a current perspective on baryon- and lepton - number conservation laws in the light of the ideas of supersymmetry and superstrings . in this latter part ,",
    "following a recent work by me  @xcite , i will also present a natural solution to the problem of rapid proton decay in the context of supersymmetry . _",
    "it turns out that the solution in question needs certain symmetries which can not arise within conventional grand unification symmetries including @xmath4 , but they do arise within superstring - derived three - family solutions .",
    "_ these symmetries play an _ essential role _ in safeguarding proton - stability from all potential dangers , to the extent desired , and simultaneously permit neutrinos to have light masses of a nature that is relevant to current experiments .",
    "_ this in turn provides a strong motivation for symmetries of string - origin_. the extra symmetries in question lead to extra @xmath12 bosons , whose currents bear the hallmark of string theories .",
    "it turns out that there is an interesting correlation between the masses of the @xmath12 bosons and observability of proton decay .    in section 2 ,",
    "i present the need for @xmath13 violation and that for @xmath14-color . in section 3 , general complexion of @xmath15 violations and the characteristic mass - scales associated with different processes are listed , and in section 4 , the main ideas as regards physics beyond the standard model are presented .",
    "section 5 provides the current status of grand unification in the context of supersymmetry and raises the issue of compatibility between mssm and string - unification .",
    "certain attempts to achieve this compatibility are presented . in section 6 ,",
    "i present the problem of @xmath5 and @xmath6 proton - decay operators and propose a solution that naturally safeguards proton - stability from all potential dangers .",
    "some concluding remarks are presented in section 7 .",
    "as stated above , the observed excess of baryons over anti - baryons implies that some form of violation of @xmath16 and/or @xmath17 must have occurred in the early universe@xcite .",
    "such an excess could arise through @xmath15 violating processes which either conserve @xmath13 , or violate it .",
    "kuzmin , rubakov and shaposnikov pointed out , however , that any excess generated through @xmath0-conserving processes at very early moments of the universe ( corresponding to temperatures @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath19 is erased subsequently by purely electroweak effects@xcite .",
    "at the same time , generating baryon - excess through electroweak effects alone does not seem to be adequate to account for the observed baryon - asymmetry@xcite .",
    "these considerations suggest that baryogenesis must have its origin ( at least in part ) in processes which violate @xmath13 .",
    "there is yet an _ independent motivation _ for violation of @xmath13 which stems from considerations of neutrino masses .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the simplest explanation for non - vanishing but light masses for the neutrinos@xcite arises in the context of left - right symmetric gauge theories@xcite and the so - called see - saw mechanism@xcite . the minimal nonabelian version of a left - right symmetric gauge theory is provided by the symmetry@xcite    @xmath20    which ensures ( i ) quantization of electric charge , ( ii ) quark - lepton unification ( through @xmath14-color ) , as well as ( iii ) parity - conservation@xcite , at a basic level .",
    "any such theory containing either @xmath21 or @xmath22 necessarily implies the existence of right - handed neutrinos @xmath23 , accompanying the left - hand ones @xmath24 .",
    "the see - saw mechanism@xcite assigns _ heavy majorana masses _",
    "@xmath25 to the right - handed neutrinos , though not to the left - handed ones .",
    "this involves a breaking of left - right symmetry and thus parity spontaneously at a high scale@xcite .",
    "now , the majorana masses for the @xmath26 , in conjunction with the standard dirac masses @xmath27 , naturally yield very light masses @xmath28 for the known neutrinos :    @xmath29    noting that the dirac mass @xmath27 of the ith neutrino is expected to be comparable to the mass of the ith up - quark ( barring qcd renormalization effects ) , it turns out that these masses for the @xmath30 have just the right pattern to be relevant to the neutrino - oscillation experiments@xcite and to @xmath31 being hot dark matter , with    @xmath32    @xmath33 gev , within a factor of 10 @xcite .",
    "heavy majorana masses for @xmath34 , however , needs spontaneous violation of lepton number l ( with @xmath35 ) and therefore of @xmath13 at a heavy intermediate scale .",
    "we thus see that both baryogenesis and neutrino masses suggest the need for microscopic violation of @xmath13 .",
    "one can argue that spontaneous violation of @xmath13 becomes obligatory in theories in which it is gauged .",
    "this is because , in these theories , there is a massless spin-1 particle coupled to @xmath13 .",
    "such a particle would be inconsistent with the results of etvos - type experiments @xcite , unless it acquires mass spontaneously .",
    "thereby , the associated charge , in this case @xmath13 , must be violated spontaneously @xcite .",
    "now , the simplest symmetry that gauges @xmath13 is @xmath14-color , which unifies quarks and leptons by using the idea that lepton number is the fourth color @xcite . _ in short , @xmath0-violation , is an integral feature of any theory containing @xmath14-color . _",
    "these considerations thus suggest that our very existence , requiring baryogenesis and therefore violation of @xmath13 , bears the footprints of certain unification ideas - in particular that of quark - lepton unification through a symmetry - like @xmath14-color .",
    "the @xmath15 violating processes which conserve @xmath13 primarily involve only proton decaying into an _ anti - lepton _ plus mesons : e.g. @xmath36 , @xmath37 etc .",
    "once one permits violation of @xmath13 , however , a whole new set of processes can in general occur .",
    "these include : ( i ) a nucleon decaying into a _ lepton _ plus mesons - i.e. @xmath38 and @xmath39 etc . , or",
    "proton decaying into a lepton + lepton + antiplepton + mesons - e.g. @xmath40 , ( iii ) majorana masses for the neutrinos , ( iv ) neutrinoless double beta decay and ( v ) @xmath41 oscillation .",
    "now , majorana masses for the right handed neutrinos , that are needed for the see - saw mechanism @xcite , can arise by introducing the pair of higgs multiplets @xmath42 and @xmath43 which transform as ( 3,1,10 ) and ( 1,3,10 ) of @xmath44 or equivalently a single higgs multiplet 126 of so(10 ) @xcite , which contains @xmath42 and @xmath45 .",
    "( an alternative choice of higgs multiplets will be presented later . )",
    "parameters of the higgs sector can be arranged such that the minimum of the potential induces a large vev @xmath46 tev , while @xmath47 @xcite . in the presence of the yukawa coupling @xmath48 ,",
    "such a vev would induce a heavy majorana mass for @xmath49 . as mentioned before ,",
    "this , in conjunction with the familiar dirac mass , yields a very light majorana mass for @xmath50 , ( see eq .",
    "the vev of @xmath51 would also break @xmath44 into the standard model symmetry @xmath52 . in this way",
    ", @xmath53 breaks lepton number @xmath17 and @xmath0 , each by two units .",
    "it also breaks parity and quark - lepton unification .    a specific set of diagrams which utilize @xmath54 and/or majorana masses for the neutrinos and",
    "thereby induce some of the ( b - l ) violating processes mentioned above are shown in figs . 1 , 2 , and 3 . the amplitudes for these processes would , of course , depend upon the effective yukawa , quartic and gauge couplings entering into the respective vertices , as well as on the masses of the intermediate particles - i.e. those of @xmath43 , the color - triplets and color - octets @xmath55 and @xmath56 , as well as @xmath57 and @xmath49 - which enter into figs . 1 , 2 , and 3",
    "now , in minimal symmetry - breaking schemes of left - right symmetric grand unification models , such as those based on one- ( or two - step)- breaking of so(10 ) , the masses of these intermediate particles typically turn out to be either superheavy @xmath58 gev , or at least medium heavy @xmath59@xcite . in this case , it is easy to verify that the rates of all these @xmath15-violating processes would be far too small to be observable .",
    "for example , even if effective yukawa and quartic couplings are of order one , the amplitudes for @xmath60 ( fig .",
    "2a ) and @xmath61 ( fig .",
    "3 ) would be of order @xmath62 , where as one would need these amplitudes to be greater than or of order of @xmath63 - i.e. @xmath64 ( say ) , for the corresponding processes to have observable rates .",
    "roughly , a similar conclusion can be drawn from a general operator analysis , based on construction of effective invariant operators@xcite and dimensional estimate .",
    "the results of such estimates for the effective mass - scales that would be necessary for the various @xmath15-violating processes to have observable rates are shown in table i.    it needs to be said that while minimal symmetry - breaking schemes for so(10 ) typically lead to effective mass - scales which are considerably larger than those shown in table i and thus rates that are considerably smaller than what would be observable , there exist viable models of the higgs system , some involving supersymmetry and thereby at least technically natural fine tuning , where relatively low effective mass - scales of the type shown in table i and , therefore , observable rates for @xmath41 oscillation @xcite and/or proton decaying into lepton plus mesons are obtained @xcite .",
    "thus , i believe that , from a broader theoretical perspective , and also because of the great significance of a positive result , if it should show , experimental searches for both @xmath65conserving , as well as the @xmath65violating processes shown in table i , are strongly motivated ."
