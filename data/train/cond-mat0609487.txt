    "<S> we report high magnetic field linear magnetostriction experiments on cecoin@xmath0 single crystals . </S>",
    "<S> two features are remarkable : ( i ) a sharp discontinuity in all the crystallographic axes associated with the upper superconducting critical field @xmath1 that becomes less pronounced as the temperature increases ; ( ii ) a distinctive second order - like feature observed only along the c - axis in the high field ( 10 t @xmath2 ) low temperature ( @xmath3 0.35 k ) region . </S>",
    "<S> this second order transition is observed only when the magnetic field lies within 20@xmath4 of the ab - planes and there is no signature of it above @xmath1 , which raises questions regarding its interpretation as a field induced magnetically ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement with previous results suggests that this anomaly is related to the transition to the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov superconducting state .    </S>",
    "<S> the unique properties of heavy fermion materials result from the strong correlation between the quasi - localized @xmath5-electrons and their interactions with the conduction @xmath6 and @xmath7-electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the partial delocalization resulting from this hybridization with the free electrons gives rise to large effective masses ( 100 - 1000 @xmath8 ) and a number of possible number of ground states . </S>",
    "<S> these include : unconventional magnetically mediated superconductivity , magnetic order , nonmagnetic kondo singlet state , etc . </S>",
    "<S> macroscopically , the magnitude of the correlations and eventually the ground state can be tuned using different parameters such as pressure or doping among others .    </S>",
    "<S> these features are beautifully exemplified in the cemin@xmath0 ( m = ir , rh , co ) family . </S>",
    "<S> its tetragonal crystal structure alternates magnetic cein@xmath9 and non - magnetic min@xmath10 layers along the c - axis . </S>",
    "<S> strong mass enhancement as well as reduced magnetic moments in the ce ions due the kondo effect are observed @xcite at low temperatures . at ambient pressure , ceirin@xmath0 is a superconductor ( @xmath11 = 0.4 k ) @xcite , cerhin@xmath0 is an antiferromagnet ( @xmath12 = 3.8 k ) @xcite and , cecoin@xmath0 is also a superconductor ( @xmath11 = 2.3 k ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these ground states are modified by external parameters . </S>",
    "<S> cerhin@xmath0 shows pressure induced superconductivity ( @xmath11 = 2.1 k at @xmath13 16 kbar ) @xcite with a wide pressure range where both antiferromagnetism ( af ) and superconductivity ( sc ) coexist @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> coexistence of af and sc is also observed in cerh@xmath14ir@xmath15in@xmath0 for 0.25 @xmath16 0.6 at ambient pressure @xcite while two different superconducting phases can be detected under pressure @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . coexistence of af and sc is also found in cerh@xmath14co@xmath15in@xmath0 @xcite . in ce@xmath17la@xmath18rhin@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic order vanishes for @xmath19 0.4 @xcite . beyond that doping level </S>",
    "<S> it remains a paramagnet where short - range magnetic correlations are observed @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , doping and pressure are not the only tuning parameters . </S>",
    "<S> a magnetic field @xmath20 , for instance , suppresses superconductivity resulting in a metallic ground state when the kinetic enegy of the induced screening currents exceeds the sc condensation energy . </S>",
    "<S> this orbital limit is characterized by a first order phase transition at the critical field @xmath21 in type - i superconductors , or by a second order transition at the upper critical field @xmath1 when the magnetic pressure is continuously relaxed through the vortex mixed state of type - ii superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> other phenomena caused by an applied field can also suppress superconductivity . in the pauli or paramagnetic limit , the singlet state formed by the pairs </S>",
    "<S> is polarized by an external @xmath20 when the zeeman energy of the of the partially polarized spins overcomes the condensation energy , breaking the pairs and destroying sc . </S>",
    "<S> whether a superconductor is orbital or pauli limited can be characterized by the so called maki parameter , @xmath22 @xcite , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the orbital and paramagnetic critical fields , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> two striking predictions were made in the pure paramagnetic limit ( @xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , the phase transition at @xmath1 should change from second to first order below a critical temperature @xmath26 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , fulde and ferrel @xcite and larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite proposed a new inhomogeneous superconducting state ( fflo state ) in which the superconducting order parameter is modulated along the magnetic field direction developing nodes where normal electrons take advantage of the zeeman energy and become polarized . </S>",
    "<S> even when orbital effects are present the fflo state can be realized for @xmath27 and close to @xmath1 , as long as the paramagnetic effect is dominant ( @xmath28 1.8 ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the large @xmath29 required for the formation of the fflo state can be achieved either by a high @xmath23 and/or a low @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> systems with heavy quasiparticle mass which reduces the kinetic energy of the shielding currents or with two - dimensional character which reduces the electrons orbital degrees of freedom will push @xmath23 up . </S>",
    "<S> a high pauli susceptibility is also indicative of the required paramagnetic character .    </S>",
    "<S> cecoin@xmath0 meets all these requirements and has in addition a large mean free path placing the system in the clean limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a crossover from a second to first order transition was observed in @xmath1 below @xmath30 1 k suggesting pauli limited sc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , specific heat experiments have recently shown @xcite a second order - like transition that occurs at low temperature ( @xmath3 0.35 k ) just below @xmath1 that is believed to be the first ever clear observation of the fflo phase . </S>",
    "<S> different experiments have confirmed this observation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a good agreement between the different works is found in the overall magnetic field versus temperature phase diagram , see fig . [ fig3](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , as with any proposed new state of matter , some debate and several open questions about the character and nature of it arise , showing the need for new experimental information pending a conclusive proof of the order parameter by means of microscopic techniques capable of direct observation of the proposed spatially inhomogeneous superconducting state .    in this work we study the coupling of the order parameter to the lattice through magnetostriction experiments . </S>",
    "<S> besides its amazing sensitivity , linear magnetostriction ( as well as thermal - expansion ) is a powerful technique to study anisotropy and reduced dimensionality because each crystal axis can be measured independently for different directions of the applied magnetic field @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the lattice coupling is strongly anisotropic and confirm the two - dimensional character of this phase . </S>",
    "<S> these observations in conjunction with previous results are consistent with a fflo state and inconsistent with field induced magnetic order .    </S>",
    "<S> cecoin@xmath0 single crystals were grown by the self - flux technique . </S>",
    "<S> the iso - thermal linear magnetostriction experiments were performed on a 1@xmath311@xmath311.5 mm@xmath32 sample using a titanium capacitance dilatometer @xcite with a resolution @xmath33 0.3  ( @xmath34 10@xmath35 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dilatometer is placed inside the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator immersed directly in the he@xmath32-he@xmath36 mixture , achieving an excellent iso - thermal condition ( @xmath37 2 mk ) and a base temperature close to 25 mk . </S>",
    "<S> the results were verified with a second larger sample . a small asymmetry is observed in the slope of the magnetostriction curves with respect to the ab - planes ( @xmath38 = 0@xmath4 in our experimental configuration sketched in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) ) , i.e. between negative and positive angles , whose origin is not yet understood @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> figure [ fig1](a ) displays the c - axis linear magnetostriction @xmath40 for different directions of @xmath20 at @xmath41 30 mk . </S>",
    "<S> two features are clearly distinguishable . a higher field first order transition which monotonically moves to lower @xmath20 as the field is rotated towards the c - axis ( @xmath38 = 90@xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this discontinuity occurs at @xmath20 = 11.7 t for @xmath38 = 0@xmath4 and @xmath20 = 4.9 t for @xmath38 = 90@xmath4 confirming that it corresponds to the upper critical field @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the length change at @xmath1 also increases continously as the field moves away from the ab - planes reaching a value of 4 @xmath31 10@xmath42 ( @xmath38 = 90@xmath4 ) in good agreement with previous results @xcite . at lower fields a second feature appears . </S>",
    "<S> it is a second order - like anomaly that occurs at @xmath43 10 t for @xmath44 0 and is observed only at low angles ( @xmath45 20@xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this can be clearly seen in fig . [ </S>",

    "<S> the second order transition are detected as a peak and a `` jump '' , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the hysteresis between the up - sweep and down - sweep curves is appreciable at @xmath1 but negligible at the lower field transition </S>",
    "<S> .    the temperature evolution of both transitions can be observed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the upper panel shows the c - axis magnetostriction for in - plane fields ( @xmath38 = 0@xmath4 ) at different temperatures , while the lower panel shows the magnetostriction coefficient @xmath46 . the second order transition ( arrows in fig . [ fig2](b ) ) moves to higher fields as the temperature is increased and vanishes around 0.35 k. above this temperature only a peak associated with @xmath1 is observed . </S>",
    "<S> this peak as well as the hysteresis become smaller as the temperature is raised implying an evolution to a conventional second order critical field as has already been reported @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our results are summarized in the phase diagrams shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . the in - plane @xmath47 phase diagram displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) is in very good agreement with previous works , including the area of occurrence of the proposed fflo state @xcite and the almost linear @xmath48-dependence of @xmath1 down to very low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this nearly linear t - dependence is interpreted as a magnetically enhanced sc due to the predominantly paramagnetic character @xcite . in this scenario , our lower field second order transition corresponds to the transition from the vortex mixed state to the fflo state , @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) shows the @xmath50 phase diagram at @xmath41 30 mk . the reduced angular range ( @xmath45 20@xmath4 ) where the proposed fflo state is observed confirms the quasi two - dimensional character of this phase and </S>",
    "<S> was attributed to the planar crystal structure that partially inhibits the orbital motion along the c - axis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results in this paper provide further evidence of reduced dimensionality and anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) shows the ab - plane linear magnetostriction for fields close to the parallel configuration ( @xmath38 = 0 where @xmath51 ) . </S>",
    "<S> no second order anomaly is detected below the sharp transition associated with @xmath1 . within the original prediction of the fflo state @xcite consisting in planes of normal electrons perpendicular to the field , our results state that a lattice coupling exists only along these nodal planes but not perpendicular to them @xcite .         </S>",
    "<S> ab - planes ) and ( b ) magnetic field versus angle ( @xmath41 30 mk ) phase diagrams </S>",
    "<S> . the lines are guides to the eye . ]    finally , we compare our results with the predictions of an alternative explanation for the proposed fflo state that considers this field induced phase as a magnetically ordered state @xcite . the argument for this state </S>",
    "<S> is based on the pressure versus temperature phase diagram of cerhin@xmath0 @xcite and is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the af ordering temperature is continously depressed with pressure and coexists with sc for @xmath52 10 kbar . beyond @xmath53 18 kbar , where @xmath54 , af abruptly disappears and only sc is observed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the experimental evidence shows that sc and af coexist in cerhin@xmath0 as long as @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> however , a magnetic field should weaken sc moving the sc+af / sc boundary to higher pressures , thereby enhancing the relative strength of the magnetic correlations and probably inducing a magnetically ordered phase even when @xmath56 . very recently , this prediction has been confirmed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a field induced , magnetically ordered phase whose @xmath57 phase diagram resembles the one in fig . [ fig3](a ) is observed between @xmath58 and @xmath59 = 22.5 kbar . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath59 characterizes a quantum critical point ( qcp ) at which @xmath60 goes to zero and no magnetic order is observed above it . </S>",
    "<S> cecoin@xmath0 is known to be in the vicinity of an af qcp @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if cecoin@xmath0 at ambient pressure is located between @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the proposed fflo state may correspond instead to a field induced magnetic order .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results are not consistent with this interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> first , at high enough fields @xmath61 exceeds @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> that means that in the phase diagram the field induced transition should cross the upper critical field , as is observed in cerhin@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our high sensitivity experiment reveals no signature of @xmath49 above @xmath1 , as is also observed in experiments performed sweeping @xmath48 at constant @xmath20 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , the area occupied by this magnetically ordered phase should decrease with @xmath63 as is also reported in cerhin@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent high pressure specific heat experiments in cecoin@xmath0 show that this area increases with @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> third , magnetic ordering should be , in principle , observed for any field direction and it is not . </S>",
    "<S> these reasons lead us to conclude that the low temperature high field phase of cecoin@xmath0 is most consistent with the fflo state and not field induced magnetic order .    </S>",
