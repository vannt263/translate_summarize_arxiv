    "when coherent optical or microwave wave trains are interchanged between three or more freely orbiting spacecraft , and phase or frequency differences of all incoming and outgoing beams recorded , there is a closure that allows subsequent elimination of all source fluctuations ( `` laser noises '' ) and so achieves sensitivity to propagating gravitational waves at much lower levels set by secondary noises . in doing this",
    ", the precise propagation times between sources and readout locations enter the data reduction algorithms , but equality of arm lengths is not necessary .",
    "we have called this scheme `` time delay interferometry '' or tdi , @xcite and subsequently analyzed several configurations and data types needed for further elimination of the most serious secondary phase noise sources , _ viz . _ those due to spacecraft non - geodesic motion ( `` optical bench noise '' ) and especially to fluctuations of the ultra - stable local oscillators , or frequency standards , used in fringe tracking ( `` uso noise '' ) @xcite .",
    "fringe tracking is necessary when the lasers in the configuration have widely differing frequencies , and/or when the configuration does not move rigidly so that emitted and received signals are doppler shifted during slow spacecraft separation changes .    the lisa space gravitational wave antenna will use tdi , and is to be roughly equilateral , which maximizes the overall response to low frequency gravitational waves over a wide band . reduction of secondary noise , and simplicity of system architecture , nevertheless suggest consideration also of other schemes ; here we consider the most extreme possible application of tdi , _ viz . _ to a linear orbiting array , or , in astronomical terms , three spacecraft flying in syzygy .",
    "we have previously considered a linear array , or parallel beam interferometric detector of gravitational waves , in work showing that with multiple bounces a split antiparallel laser beam will amplify a gravitational wave signal while laser fluctuations are cancelled conventionally by precise control of equal arm lengths @xcite .",
    "we now see the multiple readout scheme of tdi as much preferable , and equal spacing of the three spacecraft is no longer required .",
    "the equations for combining the heterodyne data streams in tdi can be taken directly from our previous papers , which had general triangular configuration ; in this paper they will be used in the linear limit .",
    "the ( nearly ) linear formation of syzygy has some advantages and disadvantages over the nominal equilateral triangular formation planned for the lisa mission .",
    "the primary disadvantages of the linear formation are less sensitivity at the low frequencies ( for a given spacecraft separation distance ) and sensitivity to only one linear combination of gw polarizations .",
    "the advantages arise from the potential for a more stable formation geometry .",
    "the nominal lisa triangular formation involves spacecraft in orbits with semi - major axis a , inclination i , and eccentricity e related by @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this choice of orbital elements produces a rotating triangular configuration with arm lengths that are constant to @xmath8 .",
    "the time variation of the arm lengths causes a variable doppler shift on the laser beam signals , a variable direction from each spacecraft to the other two spacecraft , and a variable angle between the spacecraft velocity and the direction to the other spacecraft .",
    "the ( almost ) linear array might be formed with three spacecraft moving in a single circular orbit about the sun . in the ideal case ( ignoring perturbations from other bodies ) the distance between spacecraft and the directions from each spacecraft to the others will remain constant . the constant distance between spacecraft removes the doppler shift on the laser signals .",
    "the constant directions means that no mechanism is needed to account for angle variation .",
    "the constant angle also means that a single faceted ( e.g. cubical ) test mass can be used in each spacecraft , instead of the two in the nominal lisa configuration .",
    "( in the case of spherical test masses , the constant angle between the velocity direction and direction to other spacecraft removes some surface irregularity errors that would affect a triangular formation with spherical test masses . ) the constant angle between the velocity direction and direction to other spacecraft means that the point - ahead and point - back angles are constant .",
    "( these angles arise from the need to point lasers to hit the location the other spacecraft will be at after a one - way light time . )",
    "the linear combination needs less spacecraft propulsion to reach the desired orbits ( for a given location relative to earth and arm length l ) since no plane change is needed .",
    "no laser metrology is needed for the proof masses relative to the optical benches at the outlying spacecraft ( e.g. , data we have denoted @xmath9 , @xmath10 , at spacecraft 2 ) .",
    "( at the center spacecraft ( spacecraft 1 ) the intra - spacecraft metrology data denoted @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 ) in the tdi equations must still be taken to eliminate phase fluctuations due to vibrations of the optical benches . )    the procedure for elimination of uso noise introduces considerable complication in the lisa system , inasmuch as additional calibrating data must be taken and exchanged if present generation flight - qualified uso s are used .",
    "the uso noise enters the tdi combinations multiplied by the internally generated fringe tracking frequencies @xmath13 that are required when there are inter - spacecraft doppler drifts and/or offsets of the laser center frequencies .",
    "control of relative spacecraft motions will automatically be achieved by spacing syzygy along a single nearly - circular solar orbit , and laser frequency offsets can be limited either by atomic line stabilization or by use of optical transponders @xcite .",
    "thus no wide - band fringe tracking data , uso calibration , and associated modulation of the laser beams are needed by syzygy , as will be shown in the next section .    in the linear case",
    "the gravitational wave antenna patterns of all the tdi data combination become simple and identical ( so - called 6-pulse response ) .",
    "we give this pattern explicitly in section 2 .",
    "the pattern will of course sweep over the sky as the spacecraft move along their common orbit .",
    "we apply the tdi data combinations in the linear geometry , and show how the only data combinations that are sensitive to gws have the same signal response as the combination x , the unequal arm michelson interferometer .",
    "we introduce two new independent combinations that have no gravitational wave response , denoted @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; they can be used to monitor system noises .",
    "all previously identified laser - noise - free data combinations are given in terms of x , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "in section 3 we derive the syzygy response functions for the remaining secondary noises : optical bench vibration , proof mass residual accelerations , optical path noises at the photodetector readouts , and uso noise entering in to the heterodyne measurements . in section 4",
    "we give numerical calculations and plots for these .",
    "averaging over the sky and polarization states , we finally plot the resulting gravitational wave sensitivities to incident sine waves , using one year observation time and several syzygy scale sizes .",
    "compared with an equilateral lisa , a syzygy of the same scale has similar best and high - frequency gravitational wave sensitivities",
    ". however the sensitivity is poorer at low - frequencies , suggesting applicability in the frequency band between those of ground - based interferometers and lisa .",
    "we use the notation and results of @xcite . a straight interferometric array , shown in figure 1 , is obtained by opening up the general triangular configuration of figure 2 of reference @xcite , so that spacecraft 1 is in the center and @xmath16 .",
    "we denote the linear orientation by the unit vector @xmath17 = @xmath18 . on each of the spacecraft the usual pair of optical benches",
    "can be fused into one , so we put @xmath19 . at the outlying spacecraft 2 and 3",
    "both incoming beams will be referenced to the same face of a single proof mass . at the center spacecraft ,",
    "number 1 , tdi will require use of two opposed faces of a single proof mass . for all we will have @xmath20 and the optical bench and proof mass motion components that enter are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . the intra - spacecraft data @xmath23 at the three proof masses consequently",
    "satisfy @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the first four of these then drop out of all the laser - noise - free data combinations and so in fact need not be recorded .",
    "the last two remain , and so one of them needs to be taken , which amounts to implementing precision laser metrology solely on the central spacecraft .    when all these specializations are substituted into the data combinations derived for general configurations , it is found that they degenerate into essentially one , six pulse , response to incident gravitational waves ( we use x ) plus two others that respond only to system noises ( we call them @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) . all three will further be uso - noise - free to acceptable limits if the laser frequency offsets are limited by doppler effects due to relatively stable spacecraft motion in the syzygy linear orbital configuration .",
    "specifically , the new laser - noise - free combinations we use for a linear array are    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    where a semicolon subscripted index @xmath29 is understood to mean not only time delay by @xmath30 but also multiplication by the doppler factor @xmath31 , which in this case can be dropped from spacecraft 2 to spacecraft 3 differ from @xmath32 from spacecraft 3 to spacecraft 2 , etc .",
    "one then has for syzygy @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the primes on the time - delay subscripts in these equations for x , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 have been inserted for that case , but we do not insist on that generality in any of the subsequent discussion . ] . note how interchanging indices 2 and 3 takes @xmath14 and @xmath15 into one another .",
    "the previously used tdi basic combinations in this linear array limit ( and without motion ) are given in terms of x , @xmath35 and @xmath15 :    @xmath36    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    proof mass and shot noise response functions for x and @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) are given in section 4 .",

    "the photodetectors that generate the time series @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath11 are as indicated .",
    "the outgoing light from spacecraft 1 to spacecraft 2 is routed from laser 1 on the optical bench using mirrors and beam splitters ; this beam does not interact with spacecraft 1 s proof mass .",
    "conversely , the incoming light beam from spacecraft 2 is first bounced off the nearest face of proof mass 1 before being reflected onto the photodetector , where it is mixed with light from laser 1 .",
    "this time series is @xmath41 in figure 2 .",
    "analogously , the time series @xmath40 is producted from light transmitted to and received from spacecraft 3 .",
    "the relative motion of the optical bench and proof mass is monitored by measuring the doppler shift of the light coming directly from the laser with the light bounced off one face of the proof mass ( this forms the metrology time series @xmath42 , as indicated in figure 2 .",

    "consider first the situation on spacecraft 1 .",
    "the photodetector producing @xmath41 ( moving with velocity @xmath49 ) reads that time series by mixing the beam originating from the optical bench on spacecraft 2 sent in direction @xmath50 ( laser noise @xmath51 and optical bench motion @xmath52 , delayed by propagation along @xmath53 ) , after one bounce off the proof mass ( @xmath54 ) , with the local laser light ( @xmath55 ) .",

    "the @xmath11 measurement is from light originating at the laser ( @xmath56 ) , bounced off the left face of the proof mass ( @xmath54 ) , and mixed with the direct laser light ( @xmath55 ) . for spacecraft 2 and 3 , @xmath46 , and @xmath43 are produced similarly .",
    "metrology time series on the end spacecraft are not required .",
    "we will see below that there is no gravitational wave contribution to the data @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    ". it may however be desirable to measure these to monitor system responses and secondary noises . in that case",
