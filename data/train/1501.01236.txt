    "many of the concepts and methods that emerged from research with ultracold atoms are gaining traction with more complex physical systems . in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate a combination of light - assisted molecule formation @xcite with optical lattice clock techniques @xcite that yields optical and microwave spectra of molecules with unprecedented resolution . using a narrow optical intercombination transition ,",
    "we create , probe , and image diatomic strontium molecules , @xmath0sr@xmath1 , in an optical lattice .",
    "we observe signatures of trap dimensionality in the photoassociation ( pa ) spectra of the ultracold colliding atoms that have been predicted but not yet reported @xcite .",
    "these spectra allow a precise determination of molecular transition strengths .",
    "the transition strength measurements are in good agreement with a state - of - the - art _ ab initio _ quantum chemistry model @xcite , and are essential for designing efficient molecule formation pathways , as well as for refining the toolkit of _ ab initio _ molecular calculations .",
    "we describe a new method of measuring molecular binding energies using photodissociation ( pd ) spectra , involving transitions between bound and continuum states of the atoms .",
    "this method , which is also sensitive to the dimensionality of the trapping potential , yields precise binding energies with kilohertz uncertainties that are essential for rigorous studies of molecular quantum electrodynamical effects as a function of interatomic separation .",
    "furthermore , we achieve coherent control of molecular quantum states , which is a prerequisite for a ` molecular lattice clock ' , a competitive tool for metrology and precision measurements that is sensitive to different physics than atomic microwave or optical clocks @xcite .",

    "while the lack of hyperfine structure precludes magnetoassociation of sr @xcite , narrow - line photoassociation is highly effective @xcite .",
    "the spinless @xmath4 ground state ensures a simple interatomic interaction potential , which together with advanced data and models available for this atom @xcite makes it an ideal candidate for several classes of precision measurements , as discussed below .",
