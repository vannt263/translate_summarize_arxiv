    "in the paper in which he introduces what has come to be known as the everett or many - worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics , everett ( 1957 ) states that `` fictitious paradoxes like that of einstein , podolsky , and rosen which are concerned with  correlated , noninteracting systems are easily investigated and clarified in the present scheme . '' in the everett interpretation the nonlocal notion of reduction of the wavefunction is eliminated , suggesting that questions of the locality of quantum mechanics might indeed be more easily addressed . on the other hand , while wavefunctions do not suffer reduction in the everett interpretation , nonlocality nevertheless remains present in many accounts of this formulation . in dewitt s ( 1970 ) often - quoted description , for example , `` every quantum transition taking place on every star , in every galaxy , in every remote corner of the universe is splitting our local world on earth into myriads of copies of itself . '' contrary to this viewpoint , others argue ( page , 1982 ; tipler , 1986 , 2000 ; albert and loewer , 1988 ; albert , 1992 ; vaidman , 1994 , 1998 , 1999 ; price , 1995 ; lockwood , 1996 ; deutsch , 1996 ; deutsch and hayden , 2000 ) that the everett interpretation can in fact _ resolve _ the apparent contradiction between locality and quantum mechanics .",
    "in particular , deutsch and hayden ( 2000 ) apply the everett interpretation to quantum mechanics in the heisenberg picture , and show that in eprb experiments , information regarding the correlations between systems is encoded in the heisenberg - picture operators corresponding to the observables of the systems , and is carried from system to system and from place to place in a local manner .",
    "the picture which emerges is not one of measurement - type interactions `` splitting the universe '' but , rather , producing copies of the observers and observed physical systems which have interacted during the ( local ) measurement process ( tipler , 1986 ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to summarize the formalism of measurement in the everett interpretation of heisenberg picture quantum mechanics and its application to the eprb and ghzm experiments , to emphasize the key aspects of this formulation of quantum mechanics which allow it to circumvent bell s theorem ( bell , 1964 ) and to describe the conceptual framework  a `` labeled copies interpretation''which it seems to imply .",
    "the information carried in entangled heisenberg - picture operators governs the nature of correlations observed between the states of entangled systems and the observers who measure them .",
    "it is the existence of this mechanism for bringing about , in a local manner , the perfect correlations which are observed , e.g. , when the analyzer magnets in the eprb experiment are parallel , which vitiates the reasoning which otherwise leads one to conclude that either bell s theorem must hold or nonlocal influences must come into play . since , in this scenario , even an entity as simple as an electron carries with it for eternity a record of other entities with which it has interacted , this interpretation entails a conceptual difficulty of its own .",
    "it is possible that this difficulty may be less severe if quantized fields rather than particles are considered .    in section 2 below",
    "i review the aspects of bell s theorem most relevant for the eprb and the ghzm experiments . in section 3 the everett model for quantum measurement",
    "is reviewed in the original schrdinger picture formulation as well as in the heisenberg picture .",
    "section 4 contains an analysis of the eprb and ghzm experiments from an everett point of view in the heisenberg picture . in section 5",
    "i discuss the manner in which the labeled copies interpretation of quantum mechanics avoids bell s theorem , the problem of label proliferation , and the possible relevance of quantum field theory for a solution .",
    "there are many derivations of the many variants of bell s theorem ; here we review one of the simplest ( farris , 1995 ) . consider two observers performing bohm s version ( bohm , 1951 ) of the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( einstein et al . , 1935 ) experiment ( eprb ) on pairs of spin-1/2 particles in the singlet state , using pairs of stern - gerlach analyzer magnets which can be independently oriented in one of three directions @xmath0 apart and perpendicular to the particles line of flight .",
    "define the quantity @xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the probability of both observers obtaining the result spin - up from a particle pair when analyzers 1 and 2 are oriented in directions @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "each of the three probabilities on the right - hand side of equation ( 1 ) can be determined experimentally to any desired degree of accuracy , by performing many repetitions of the eprb experiment with the analyzers held in the appropriate directions .",
    "there is no quantum - mechanical restriction on performing these experiments because , in each case , we are measuring spin components of two _ different _ particles , so the measurements commute .",
    "however , whenever experiments are performed in which both analyzer magnets have the same orientation @xmath6 , we observe that @xmath7 for any and all choices of @xmath6 .",
    "that is , if the analyzer directions are the same , we find that whenever a particle is deflected in one direction by one of the analyzers , its partner is deflected in the opposite direction by the other analyzer .",
    "we find that the correlations persist even when we consider only cases in which the analyzer orientations come to be parallel by chance , because they ve been chosen at the last possible moment before the particles arrive by some random process ( delayed - choice experiment ) .",
    "we are thus compelled to pose a `` bothersome question '' ( mermin , 1990a ) : what is the mechanism which brings about these correlations ? in answer",
    ", we adopt what seems the only explanation open to us : each particle , even before its spin is measured by the analyzer , carries with it information``instruction sets , '' as termed by mermin ( 1990a)determining what its response will be to the analyzer in every possible orientation .",
    "having accepted this explanation , our doom is sealed . for",
    "if this explanation holds , it is a well - defined notion to talk about what _ would _ have happened if an analyzer had been oriented other than as it actually was in any given experiment .",
    "that is , we define the quantity @xmath8 to be the probability that particle 1 is carrying instructions to be deflected up by an analyzer with orientation @xmath4 , and at the same time is carrying instructions to be deflected down by an analyzer at orientation @xmath5 .",
    "this can not be measured directly ; but , by the reasoning above , it has the value @xmath9 so , using this in ( [ qdef ] ) , @xmath10 and since the probabilities which are being added on the right - hand side of ( [ qis ] ) are of mutually exclusive events ( e.g. , particle 1 is carrying instructions to be deflected _ either _ up _ or _",
    "down by a magnet with orientation @xmath11 ) we conclude @xmath12 this inequality contradicts the prediction obtained from a quantum - mechanical calculation of @xmath1 ( see , e.g. , section [ eprbe ] below ) , and it is the latter which is borne out by actual experiments ( aspect et al . , 1982 ; weihs et al . ,",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the arguments leading to mermin s ( 1990b , c ) three - particle version of the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( greenberger et al . ,",
    "1989,1990 ) experiment ( ghzm ) are similarly based on the need to explain perfect correlations . in this case , the fact that the results of spin measurements made on one particle correlate perfectly with those made on two other particles drives us to conclude that the results of spin measurements on all three particles are governed by instruction sets .",
    "the three particles in question each have spin-1/2 and travel outward from a common source in three coplanar directions .",
    "the spin of each particle is measured by an analyzer magnet that can be oriented at any angle in the plane perpendicular to the corresponding particle s line of flight .",
    "( the @xmath13 direction is perpendicular to the common plane of the particles motion . ) quantum mechanics predicts ( see section [ ghzme ] ) that @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the probability that an even number of spin measurements will be up .",
    "enumeration of the possible instruction sets that could account for these results ( mermin , 1990b ) leads to the conclusion  here , not an inequality , but an equality  that @xmath16 however , a direct quantum - mechanical calculation of this quantity gives a probability , not of zero , but of unity ( see section [ ghzme ] ) .",
    "everett s paper presents a model of ideal measurements in quantum mechanics .",
    "consider a physical system @xmath17 and an observer @xmath18 .",
    "the space of states of @xmath17 is spanned by the eigenstates of a hermitian operator @xmath19 with eigenvalues @xmath20 : @xmath21 for simplicity we will assume that the eigenvalues @xmath20 are nondegenerate . here and below , unless indicated otherwise ,",

    "the interaction corresponding to the measurement of @xmath17 by @xmath18 is represented by a unitary time - evolution operator @xmath26 acting in the product space of the state spaces of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in order to correspond to an ideal measurement ( the only type considered in this paper )",
    ", @xmath26 must have the property that if at time @xmath27 @xmath18 is in a state of ignorance and @xmath17 is in a state where the quantity represented by @xmath19 definitely has the value @xmath20i.e .",

    "( in section [ eprb ] below we give a specific example of operators @xmath39 for the case @xmath43 . )      in the heisenberg picture , time dependence is carried by the operators .",
    "heisenberg - picture operators will be distinguished by explicit time arguments . at the initial time @xmath44 the heisenberg - picture operators are identical to their schrdinger - picture counterparts : @xmath45 at time @xmath46 , after @xmath18 has measured @xmath17 , these operators become , respectively , @xmath47 here @xmath48 , and , for now , it is assumed that no interaction takes place between @xmath44 and @xmath27 .    from ( [ a0]-[i_o ] ) , ( [ u_form ] ) , ( [ t0_ops ] ) , and ( [ t2_ops ] ) , @xmath49 since @xmath50    in the heisenberg picture operator the @xmath17 observable @xmath51 is the same after the measurement as before .",
    "( this will not be the case in general ; see section [ eprbne ] . ) however , the @xmath18 observable @xmath52 has become entangled with @xmath17 , in that it is no longer in the form ( [ b0 ] ) , the tensor product of an operator acting on @xmath18 states with the identity operator on @xmath17 states , but instead acts nontrivially on the states of @xmath17 .",
    "this is the hallmark of entanglement in the heisenberg picture ( despagnat , 1995 , section 10.8 ) .",
    "the heisenberg picture state vector , on the other hand , remains at all times equal to the nonentangled schrdinger picture time-@xmath44 state vector ( [ psi1 ] ) .",
    "in eprb and ghzm experiments , the particles are prepared in a state in which they are entangled with each other before measurement . a spin component of each of the particles is subsequently measured by a corresponding analyzer magnet which can be at one of several orientations . as in the previous section , the action of the unitary time evolution operator will first be determined by working in the schrdinger picture and subsequently used to compute the form of the time - dependent operators in the heisenberg picture . for purposes of computational convenience , all operator",

    "we take the state at the initial time @xmath44 to be one in which all four observers are ignorant and in which all three particles have spin up with respect to their respective @xmath57-axes : @xmath134 here we take the positive @xmath57 axis for each particle to be in the direction of its motion , and the positive @xmath135 axis perpendicular to the plane in which their motion lies ( same direction for all particles ) .    the expected value of @xmath115 s awareness at time @xmath136 is @xmath137 if the eigenvalues @xmath121 and @xmath122 have the respective values 0 and 1 , then the operator @xmath117 measures the probability of @xmath115 determining that the @xmath54 s observe an even number of spin - up particles during one run of the ghzm experiment : @xmath138      we first consider the case in which an entangling interaction among the particles is absent , i.e. , @xmath139 then , using the above equation with ( [ projopdetail ] ) , ( [ moreprojopdetail ] ) , and ( [ peug ] ) @xmath140 independent of the @xmath141 s .",
    "so , for _ any _ choices of the analyzer - magnet orientations @xmath66 perpendicular to the particles respective directions of motion ( @xmath142 ) , @xmath143      on the other hand , if @xmath96 is such as to take the initial @xmath53 state to the ghzm state , i.e. , @xmath144 the probability of @xmath115 determining that an even number of spin - up measurements are made is , using the above equation with([projopdetail ] ) , ( [ moreprojopdetail ] ) , and ( [ peug ] ) , @xmath145 or , for @xmath142 , @xmath146 so an even number of spin - up measurements will never be found if one of the analyzers is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the particles motion , @xmath14 but , contrary to the prediction ( [ ghzm_is ] ) from instruction - set reasoning , an even number of spin - up measurements will _ always _ be found if all analyzers are oriented in the same sense perpendicular to this plane : @xmath147",
    "in the heisenberg - picture formalism , the reason for the difference between the correlations of the observers measurements in the nonentangled and entangled cases is the presence in the operators @xmath148 , @xmath117 of different factors acting in subspaces of states pertaining , not to the observers but , rather , to the particles with which the observers have interacted by virtue of the measurements they ve performed .",
    "these factors are in effect `` labels '' which become attached to the observers @xmath54 , @xmath115 after they have undergone the local interactions @xmath149 , @xmath150",
    ". in the case that , prior to any measurements , the particles are subject to a local entangling interaction @xmath96 , each of the particles @xmath53 is labeled with a factor acting in the space of states of the other particle(s ) with which it has interacted , so the label which becomes attached to @xmath54 after measuring the corresponding particle @xmath53 involves factors corresponding to the particle which the other observer(s ) measured . in the end the observers compare their observations by means of another local interaction ( @xmath79 interrogates @xmath80 , @xmath115 interrogates @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath116 ) , which has the effect of computing quantities such as ( [ bprod ] ) and ( [ gexpt ] ) .",
    "the conceptual picture which emerges is thus the following : interactions between entities label those entities .",
    "the labels consist of modifications to the heisenberg - picture operators corresponding to the properties of the entities . measurement - type interactions ( [ u_form ] ) transform the operators for the states of awareness of observers into sums of operators , each corresponding to a distinct state of awareness of the observer , and each labeled with factors corresponding to the system which the observer measured , as well as to other systems with which _ that _ system has previously interacted .",
    "these labels control the subsequent results of measurement involving the labeled operators , including in particular measurements of correlations between the states of awareness of observers who have measured particles which have previously interacted with one another .",
    "bell s theorem ( [ qcontrapred ] ) , ( [ ghzm_is ] ) is avoided because the counterfactual reasoning which leads to it is not required and can not be justified . in answer to the question `` what is the mechanism which brings about these correlations ? ''",
    "there exists an answer other than the existence of instruction sets .",
    "namely : when one of the observers performing , say , an eprb experiment with both analyzer magnets oriented in the same direction measures the spin of one of the paired particles , that observer splits into noninteracting copies , each copy labeled with information corresponding to the states of the observed particle as well as to the state of the other particle .",
    "when the two observers  or , more precisely , the two pairs of observer - copies ",
    "exchange information about the results of their measurements , it is the attached labels which ensure that the `` correct '' copies of each of the observers interact ; e.g. , preventing two observer - copies who have both observed spin - up from communicating .    to be _ completely _ precise",
    ", we should say `` two pairs of _ sets _ of observer - copies . ''",
    "this is necessary because , of course , the analyzer magnets need not be oriented in the same direction .",
    "when the analyzer magnets do not have the same orientation , there are four possible outcomes which the observers can experience , with ( in general ) unequal probabilities for the `` same - spin '' and `` different - spin '' cases . to avoid being led to the conclusion that our formalism erroneously implies equal probabilities for all outcomes regardless of the magnet orientations ( ballentine , 1973 ; graham , 1973 ) , we proceed along the lines of deutsch s ( 1985 ) modification to the everett interpretation and regard , for example , the third and fourth lines of eq .",

    "( [ bprodentangled ] ) represent continuous infinities of four different types of pairs of observers (  saw - up / saw - up ,  `` saw - up / saw - down , '' etc . ) .",
    "the relative number of each type , as well as the specific nature of each type ( states of awareness of the observers ) , is governed by the expectation value of the corresponding term in the initial state @xmath151 .",
    "so , the splitting of each observer into copies at each measurement interaction is represented by the local dynamics of the operators describing their states of awareness relative to what they were at the initial time @xmath44 ; in particular , the possibilities for interaction of observers of entangled systems are determined by the labels attached to the operators .",
    "determination of the number of each type of observer - copy produced at each splitting , as well as the specific state of awareness of each type of observer - copy , involves information about the initial conditions of the system , information which in the heisenberg picture is contained in the time @xmath44 state vector .",
    "( dewitt ( 1998 ) emphasizes that quantum systems are `` described jointly by the dynamical variables and the state - vector . '' ) just as observers or other entities may be regarded as receiving and carrying with them , in a local manner , the labels described above , they may also be envisioned as carrying with them in a similarly local manner the requisite initial - condition information .    since one can not argue for the existence of counterfactual instruction sets",
    ", the conditions of bell s theorem do not apply . had angles other than those that actually were used",
    "been chosen for the analyzer magnets , copies of each observer carrying labels appropriate to those angles would have resulted .",
    "there are indeed `` instruction sets '' present ; but they determine , not the results of experiments which were not performed but , rather , the possibilities for interaction and information exchange between the everett copies of the observers who have performed the experiments .",
    "bohr s reply to epr can also be reinterpreted in the present context .",
    "regarding correlations at a distance , bohr ( 1935 ) states that  of course there is in a case like that just considered no question of a mechanical disturbance of the system under investigation during the last critical stage of the measuring procedure .",
    "but even at this stage there is essentially the question of _ an influence on the very conditions which define the possible types of predictions regarding the future behavior of the system . ",
    "_ the everett splitting and labeling of each observer constitutes just such an influence , determining the possible types of interactions with physical systems and observers which the observer can experience in the future without in any way producing a `` mechanical disturbance '' of distant entities .",
    "the everett interpretation in the heisenberg picture thus removes nonlocality from the list of conceptual problems of quantum mechanics .",
    "the idea of viewing the tensor - product factors in the heisenberg - picture operators as in some sense `` literally real '' introduces , however , a conceptual problem of its own .",
    "( d espagnat , 1995 , section 10.8 ) should _ not _ be a problem in viewing them as `` real , '' any more than , e.g. , the fact that the components of the electromagnetic stress tensor depend on the choice of lorentz frame . ]",
    "entanglement via the introduction of nontrivial `` label '' factors is not limited to interactions between two or three particles ; each particle of matter is labeled , for eternity , by all the particles with which it has ever interacted .",
    "_ what is the physical mechanism by means of which all of this information is stored ? _",
    "the issue of `` where the labels are stored '' may seem less problematic in the context of the everett interpretation of heisenberg - picture quantum field theory .",
    "after all , in quantum field theory , operators corresponding to each species of particle and evolving according to local differential equations already reside at each point in spacetime .",
    "( in the eprb and ghzm experiments the particles in question are considered to be distinguishable and so may be treated , for purposes of analyzing the experiments , as quanta of different fields .",
    "more complicated objects , such as observers and magnets , might be approximated as excitations of effective composite fields , following , e.g. , zhou et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . )    even in the event that such a program for a literal , indeed mechanistic picture of measurement in quantum field theory can not be realized , it remains the case that everett s model for measurement in the heisenberg picture provides a quantum formalism which is explicitly local and in which the problem of bell s theorem does not arise .",

    "<S> bell s theorem depends crucially on counterfactual reasoning , and is mistakenly interpreted as ruling out a local explanation for the correlations which can be observed between the results of measurements performed on spatially - separated quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> but in fact the everett interpretation of quantum mechanics , in the heisenberg picture , provides an alternative local explanation for such correlations . </S>",
    "<S> measurement - type interactions lead , not to many worlds but , rather , to many local copies of experimental systems and the observers who measure their properties . </S>",
    "<S> transformations of the heisenberg - picture operators corresponding to the properties of these systems and observers , induced by measurement interactions , `` label '' each copy and provide the mechanism which , e.g. , ensures that each copy of one of the observers in an eprb or ghzm experiment will only interact with the `` correct '' copy of the other observer(s ) . </S>",
    "<S> the conceptual problem of nonlocality is thus replaced with a conceptual problem of proliferating labels , as correlated systems and observers undergo measurement - type interactions with newly - encountered objects and instruments ; it is suggested that this problem may be resolved by considering quantum field theory rather than the quantum mechanics of particles . </S>"
