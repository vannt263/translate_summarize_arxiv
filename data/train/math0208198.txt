    "in the classical theory of monads @xcite or triples @xcite one deals with the following construction .",
    "if a functor @xmath4 has a left adjoint @xmath5 with unit @xmath6 and counit @xmath7 then there is a monad @xmath8 on @xmath2 such that @xmath9 factorizes as @xmath10 through the forgetful functor @xmath11 of the category @xmath12 of @xmath13-algebras with a unique functor @xmath14 , called the eilenberg - moore comparison functor .",
    "for example , if @xmath15 is a ring , i.e. , a monoid in @xmath16 then the forgetful functor @xmath17 has a left adjoint , the induction functor @xmath18 and the eilenberg - moore category @xmath12 is equivalent to the category of left @xmath15-modules via @xmath19 . as it is the case in this example so in general , if @xmath19 is an equivalence @xmath9 is called monadic .    interpreting the category @xmath12 as the category of @xmath13-modules the above construction appears as a primitive version of tannaka reconstruction in which adjointable functors are brought into correspondence with monads on their target categories . monadicity in turn plays the role of the representation theorem . pursuing this idea",
    "one can investigate the extra structure the monad acquires if the forgetful functor is monoidal . what one obtains is that the monad is oplax monoidal ( called lax comonoidal in this paper ) in the sense of the underlying functor being lax comonoidal and the natural transformations preserve these comonoidal structures .",
    "such monads will be called _",
    "bimonads_. bimonads are the abstract versions of bialgebras in the same spirit as monads are related to algebras .",
    "bimonads first appeared in the work of moerdijk@xcite under the name hopf monads .",
    "he was motivated by generalizing the notion of hopf operad . in our context",
    "the name bimonad seems to be the more natural as it rhymes with bialgebra and bialgebroid .",
    "hopf algebroid could then be the name for a bimonad possessing some sort of antipode .",
    "the motivating example of bimonads is associated to a takeuchi @xmath3-algebra @xcite , also called _ bialgebroid _ @xcite . for a bialgebroid @xmath15 over @xmath20",
    "the algebra @xmath15 is an extension of @xmath21 , so @xmath15 is an @xmath22-@xmath22-bimodule .",
    "the underlying functor @xmath1 of the bimonad is @xmath23 where we identified @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "such bimonads are obtained by the above mentioned tannaka recontruction from the strict monoidal forgetful functors @xmath26 . that bialgebroid structures on @xmath15 over @xmath20 are in one - to - one correspondence with the strict monoidal forgetful functors @xmath27 was first pointed out by schauenburg @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "of course , the notion of bimonad is much more general than bialgebroids .",
    "but there is a simple criterion for a bimonad @xmath13 on @xmath24 to be a bialgebroid : the underlying functor @xmath1 must have a right adjoint ( see theorem [ thm : bgd bimonads ] ) .",
    "tannaka duality for bialgebroids has recently been proven by phng h hi @xcite following the tradition of saavedra @xcite , deligne @xcite and generalizing the results of ulbrich @xcite , schauenburg @xcite for hopf algebras and of hayashi @xcite for weak hopf algebras . for more about this theory",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the approach of the present paper does not fit into this series mathematically but perhaps ` physically ' .",
    "the categories we think about are module categories and therefore are not small .",
    "this forbids to compute the ( quantum ) group(oid ) object as a coend .",
    "also , we do not use any finiteness condition on the images of the functors .",
    "instead we assume that the functors have left adjoints , and at the end also right ones .",
    "the question of when the bialgebroid we construct has an antipode , in either lu s @xcite or schauenburg s @xcite sense , is not addressed in this paper .",
    "we use the following terminology .",
    "a _ lax monoidal functor _ is a triple @xmath28 where @xmath5 is a functor between monoidal categories from @xmath29 to @xmath30 , @xmath31 is a natural transformation and @xmath32 is an arrow such that the usual hexagonal and the two square diagrams commute @xcite .",
    "a _ lax comonoidal functor _",
    "@xmath33 from @xmath34 to @xmath2 is a lax monoidal functor from @xmath35 to @xmath36 ( no change in the monoidal product ) .",
    "that is to say , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the commutative diagrams they satisfy are obtained by reversing all the arrows is the usual hexagon and square diagrams of a lax monoidal functor .",
    "monoidal functor _ is a lax monoidal functor in which the @xmath39 s and the @xmath40 are isomorphisms .",
    "_ comonoidal functors _ are defined analogously .",
    "of course , monoidal and comonoidal functors are essentially the same : @xmath28 is monoidal iff @xmath41 is comonoidal . in later sections where there will be a shortage of the greek alphabet we shall use the notation @xmath42 for a lax monoidal and @xmath43 for a lax comonoidal functor .",
    "there is also a dual analogue of monoidal natural transformations",
    ". a monoidal natural transformation between lax comonoidal functors will be called _",
    "comonoidal_. so the monoidal categories , the lax comonoidal functors and the comonoidal natural transformations form a 2-category @xmath44 just like the lax monoidal functors are the 1-cells of the 2-category @xmath45 .",
    "a bimonad on the monoidal category @xmath46 is a quintuple @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a monad on @xmath2 , @xmath49 is a comonoidal functor and @xmath50 and @xmath51 satisfy compatibility conditions with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the 10 commutative diagrams these natural transformations should satisfy are the simplest possible ones in spite of the fact that they are equivalent , at least if @xmath1 has a right adjoint , to the somewhat unpleasent bialgebroid axioms that either mix algebra and coalgebra structures in a painful way @xcite or use a non - monoidal product in the definition of coalgebras @xcite .    at last but not least the bimonad description offers natural ways to define the category of bialgebroids which , even for the special case of weak bialgebras and weak hopf algebras @xcite , has not been investigated in detail yet .",
    "unfortunately , it offers two natural ways . at first , since bimonads are monads , one can take street s definition @xcite of the 2-category @xmath54 of monads in @xmath44 . in this framework",
    "all functors are lax comonoidal so the monad morphisms @xmath55 involve lax comonoidal functors @xmath56 .",
    "this approach was chosen by mccrudden in the preprint @xcite many results of which overlap ours .",
    "but the present paper uses another method to define the category of bimonads and therefore of bialgebroids .",
    "we insist on having lax monoidal functors in monad morphisms since it is more motivated by previous experience with quantum groupoids .",
    "so our 2-category @xmath57 of bimonads has objects the bimonads but has lax monoidal functors in the definition of monad morphisms .",
    "this choice forces the @xmath58 in the monad morphism to be _ ambimonoidal _ natural transformation ( see definition [ def : ambi ] ) . with this tentative expression we refer to the unique way of compatibility with the ( co)monoidal structures which , however , lies between the usual monoidality and comonoidality of natural transformations .    having a 2-category of bialgebroids one can imagine the 2-category of hopf algebroids as a subcategory .",
    "the equivalence classes of objects in this 2-category may turn out to be the appropriate objects which characterize a class of monoidal categories uniquely , similarly to the doplicher - roberts characterization @xcite of certain symmetric monoidal c@xmath59-categories as representation categories of uniquely determined compact groups .",
    "the whole content of this paper rests on the following result which can be found in various forms in the categorical literature , in most general form perhaps in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we provide an explicit proof in order for the paper to be selfcontained even for non - specialists .",
    "[ thm : f - sigma - pi ] let @xmath60 be a lax monoidal functor from @xmath61 to @xmath62 . if @xmath9 has a left adjoint @xmath63 with counit @xmath7 and unit @xmath64 then the natural transformation _",
    "x , y:=_fxfyf_fx , fyf(_x_y ) and the arrow : = _ fgive rise to a lax comonoidal functor @xmath65 .",
    "the expression for @xmath66 contains three products : the horizontal and vertical composition of natural transformations and the cartesian product .",
    "so the statement requires 3-categorical computations , in the monoidal 2-category @xmath67 . denoting the vertical composition by @xmath68 , the horizontal by juxtaposition and the cartesian product by @xmath69 and using the , perhaps strange , precedence of horizontal composition coming first and vertical coming last , we can write = ( ff)f(ff)f ( )  .",
    "denoting by @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 the associativity and unit coherence isomorphisms in any one of the monoidal categories , the proof of the hexagon ( fff)(f ) ( ) = ( f)()fgoes as follows .",
    "@xmath73 @xmath74 where in the subsequent equations we used the definition of @xmath66 , naturality of the @xmath75 of the 4th term , naturality of the @xmath76 of the 5th term , naturality of the first @xmath51 of the 6th term , naturality of the @xmath76 of the 4th term , naturality of the @xmath51 of the 5th term , and at last the adjointness @xmath77 and some cosmetics .",
    "a similarly long calculation , or arguing with @xmath78 , yields the formula @xmath79 composing the first with @xmath80 and the second with @xmath81 and using the hexagon for @xmath76 ( ) ( u)(uuu ) = u()(u ) one immediately obtains the hexagon for @xmath66 .",
    "it remained to show the squares of @xmath66 and @xmath82 _fx(fx)c_,x&=&f_x + _ fx(fx)c_x,&=&f_x",
    "but we will suffice with proving the first .",
    "@xmath83 where in the last but one equality the square of @xmath76 and @xmath40 was used .",
    "we remark that the converse of the above theorem holds , too . if @xmath33 is lax comonoidal then @xmath84 defines a lax monoidal structure for @xmath9 .",
