    "the above simple slips are not linearly independent . for odd number of qubits , there are no homogenous slips with degree 2 , and the lowest degree in this case is 4 ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the number of homogenous slips of degree 4 is @xmath276 ( see below ) , whereas the number of our polynomials @xmath277 of degree 4 is equal to the number of inequivalent bipartite cuts @xmath59 which is given by @xmath278 where we assumed that @xmath5 is odd .",

    "<S> we then construct the complete set of all such sl - invariant polynomials ( slips ) . </S>",
    "<S> our construction is based on schur - weyl duality and applies to any number of qudits in all ( finite ) dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we provide an elegant formula for the dimension of the homogenous slips space of a fixed degree as a function of the number of qudits . </S>",
    "<S> the expressions for the slips involve in general many terms , but for the case of qubits we also provide much simpler expressions .    </S>",
    "<S> [ theorem]lemma [ theorem]corollary [ theorem]conjecture [ theorem]proposition    multi - particle entanglement is an essential resource for a variety of quantum information processing tasks . </S>",
    "<S> these include conventional  @xcite and measurement - based quantum computation  @xcite , quantum error correction schemes  @xcite , quantum secret sharing  @xcite , quantum simulations  @xcite , and in principle in any task involving entangled many - body quantum systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these applications to quantum information , along with its intriguing properties and potential applications to condensed matter physics  @xcite , sparked an enormous amount of literature dedicated to the classification of multipartite entanglement . nevertheless , our current understanding of multipartite entanglement is very limited , and besides few cases involving small systems , the resource theory of multipartite entanglement is still in its infancy  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> entanglement is a non - local resource with which it is possible to overcome the limitations imposed by local operations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , multipartite states are classified according to their inter - convertibility under stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that is , two states belong to the same entanglement class ( or slocc equivalent class ) if it is possible to reversibly convert one state to the other with non - zero probability using only locc . while in three qubits there are only 6 inequivalent slocc classes , in four ( or more ) qubits there are already uncountable number of inequivalent slocc classes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a simple indication that the complexity in characterizing slocc classes grows rapidly as the number of particles increases .    </S>",
    "<S> initially , much of the literature focused on classification of slocc classes in terms of homogeneous polynomial functions of the coefficients of the pure multi - qudit state in question . </S>",
    "<S> if these polynomials on @xmath0-qudit systems are also invariant under @xmath1 ( here @xmath2 is the set of all @xmath3 complex matrices with determinant 1 ) then their absolute values are measures of genuine multipartite entanglement  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these entanglement measures have many interesting and desirable properties , including initial - state - independence behavior under local noise  @xcite . for pure two qubits and three qubits systems , the concurrence  @xcite and </S>",
    "<S> the 3-tangle  @xcite are the unique polynomials of this kind . for four qubits , </S>",
    "<S> however , there are infinitely many such invariants and the set of all of them is generated by four invariants  @xcite . beyond that , and despite the extensive literature , very little is known about the set of all such sl - invariant polynomials ( slips ) except for few techniques that were used to construct some of the slips for multi - qubit states  @xcite .    in this letter we show that almost all slocc equivalent classes , including the dense set of stable slocc classes , can be distinguished by ratios of homogeneous slips of the same degree . </S>",
    "<S> we then find an algorithm to construct _ all _ of the slips . </S>",
    "<S> our main idea is to look at homogenous polynomials of a fixed degree @xmath4 , and view them as vectors in a hilbert space consisting of @xmath4-copies of the original hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> this identification enables us to use the schur - weyl duality and other techniques from representation and invariant theory to construct the full set of homogeneous slips of degree @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our technique can be applied to any number of qudits in all dimensions . for the case of qubits </S>",
    "<S> , we also find an elegant way to express many of the slips .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider here the hilbert space of @xmath5 qudits which we denote by : @xmath6 local ( generalized ) measurements on each of the @xmath5 qudits , can transform probabilistically an initial pure state @xmath7 to some other pure state @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are @xmath10 matrices . </S>",
    "<S> if this transformation is reversible then all the matrices @xmath11 can be taken to be invertible  @xcite , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are said to be slocc equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested here in characterizing classes of slocc equivalent states .    up to normalization </S>",
    "<S> , an invertible slocc map @xmath14 can be described as an element of the group @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the group consisting of all @xmath10 complex invertible matrices with determinant 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this last condition implies that the states @xmath17 for @xmath18 are in general not normalized even if @xmath19 is normalized . </S>",
    "<S> the orbit @xmath20 is therefore consisting of non - normalized states in the slocc equivalent class of @xmath19 . working with non - normalized states </S>",
    "<S> enables us to characterize the distinct orbits @xmath21 with slips , while the distinct slocc classes can be characterized by ratios of the slips .    a polynomial @xmath22 that satisfies @xmath23 is called @xmath24-invariant polynomial ( slip ) . </S>",
    "<S> the set of all slips form a vector space over @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> we can always choose the basis of this polynomial space to consist of _ homogeneous _ slips   acting on @xmath26 linearly . ] . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we will focus on homogeneous slips of some degree @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the dimension of the space of homogeneous polynomials of fixed degree @xmath4 is finite , although we will see that it grows exponentially with @xmath5 . in the supplemental material </S>",
    "<S> we show that the degree @xmath4 must be divisible by the least common multiple of the integers @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies for example that for qubits there are only slips of even degree .    </S>",
    "<S> we show now that slips can be used to determine whether two states in @xmath26 belong to the same slocc class . indeed , suppose that @xmath29 are two ( normalized ) states belonging to the same slocc class . </S>",
    "<S> that is , there exists a phase @xmath30 and @xmath18 such that @xmath31 is a homogenous slip of degree @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath32 suppose now that @xmath33 is another homogeneous slip of the _ same _ degree @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> since it also satisfies the relation  , we get @xmath34 assuming @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if @xmath19 and @xmath36 belong to the same slocc class they must satisfy   for any pair of two homogeneous slips of the same degree ( this direction was pointed out recently in  @xcite ) . here we show that the converse also holds for almost all states in @xmath26 ( see details of the proof in the supplementary material ) :    let @xmath29 be two stable states ( i.e. states @xmath19 whose orbits @xmath37 are closed ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , there exists @xmath30 and @xmath18 such that   holds if and only if   holds for all homogeneous slips of degree @xmath4 with @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> the set of all stable states is open and dense in @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> it contains almost all states in @xmath26 including many non - generic states . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , an orbit @xmath38 is stable if and only if it contains a state with the property that the reduced density matrix on each single qudit ( after tracing out the other @xmath39 qudits ) is proportional to the identity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , many interesting and physically relevant states are stable . </S>",
    "<S> this includes all quantum error - correcting code states , all ghz states , all cluster states , and in general all graph states . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our construction below of all slips provides an almost - complete classification of @xmath26 into slocc equivalent classes .    </S>",
    "<S> slips involve in general cumbersome expressions . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the case of @xmath5 qubits there exists a large class of polynomials that can be expressed very elegantly . </S>",
    "<S> the main reason for that is the existence of the matrix @xmath40 for which any @xmath41 matrix @xmath42 satisfies @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the transposed matrix of @xmath45 . in higher dimensions , such an invariant matrix @xmath46 that satisfies the above equation for </S>",
    "<S> all @xmath47 does not exist . </S>",
    "<S> thus , before introducing our main results , we first show that this property of @xmath46 leads to a large class of slips in the qubit case where @xmath48 for all @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> the above property of @xmath46 implies that for any two states @xmath29 , and any @xmath18 , @xmath50 where the bilinear form @xmath51 is defined by @xmath52 here @xmath46 appears @xmath5-times , and the vector @xmath53 is the complex conjugate of @xmath19 when it is expressed in a fixed basis such that each @xmath46 has the form  ( [ j ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath54 is an homogenous slip of degree 2 . </S>",
    "<S> note however that for odd @xmath5 , @xmath55 since in that case @xmath56 is a skew - symmetric matrix  .    for any choice of @xmath57 qubits in @xmath26 with @xmath58 , we associate a bipartite cut @xmath59 between the chosen @xmath57 qubits,@xmath60 , and the remaining @xmath61 qubits , @xmath62 . for a given @xmath57 </S>",
    "<S> there are @xmath63 bipartite cuts of the form @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> now , fix a bipartite cut @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> any state @xmath65 can be written as @xmath66 and @xmath67 are orthonormal bases of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> for any such @xmath19 , we denote by @xmath45 the @xmath70 matrix whose elements are @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we denote by @xmath72 the @xmath73 matrix whose elements are @xmath74 , and by @xmath75 the @xmath76 matrix whose elements are @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the bilinear form defined in eq.([blin ] ) . with this notation </S>",
    "<S> we get ( see more details in the supplementary material ) that for any @xmath79 the function @xmath80\\ ] ] is an slip of degree @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath82 is invariant under a change of bases in @xmath68 and @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since the form @xmath83 is symmetric for even @xmath57 , if @xmath57 is even we can choose the basis @xmath84 such that the matrix @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , if @xmath61 is even then we can choose the basis @xmath67 such that the matrix @xmath75 is the identity .    </S>",
    "<S> the slips defined above are not all independent . </S>",
    "<S> different bipartite cuts can lead to the same polynomial . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the case of even number of qubits , all the polynomials @xmath86 , corresponding to @xmath63 bipartite cuts @xmath59 , are the same ( up to a constant factor ) since there is only one slip of degree 2 given by @xmath54  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore natural to ask if all slips can be written as linear combinations of @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> it is true for degrees 2 and 4 , but already in 5 qubits there exists ( see below ) a unique polynomial of degree 6 , whereas our polynomials @xmath88 can not be of degree 6 if @xmath5 is odd . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore need a more systematic way to construct all slips .    </S>",
    "<S> we are now ready to introduce our main technique to compute the @xmath89-invariants in the space of polynomials on @xmath26 of degree @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the set of all these slips by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the vector of the dimensions of the @xmath5-qudits . </S>",
    "<S> observe that any homogeneous polynomial on @xmath26 of degree @xmath4 can be written as an inner product between some vector @xmath92 and @xmath4-copies of a vector @xmath93 : @xmath94 hence , any homogeneous polynomial on @xmath26 of degree @xmath4 corresponds to some ( not necessarily unique ) vector @xmath95 . note that </S>",
    "<S> if we also have @xmath96 for all @xmath18 , then the polynomial @xmath97 is @xmath89-invariant . </S>",
    "<S> denoting by @xmath98 all such @xmath89-fixed vectors of @xmath99 , we conclude : @xmath100 note however that in general distinct vectors in @xmath99 can lead to the _ same _ polynomial and , in particular , we will see below that @xmath101 is much larger than @xmath102 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now show how this view of slips leads to an algorithm for finding all of them . </S>",
    "<S> we first write out @xmath103 in terms of the standard basis in each tensor slot . that is,@xmath104 and each @xmath105 is an element in the computational basis of @xmath26 , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. it is of the form @xmath106 with @xmath107 for @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> writing @xmath109 relative to the same computational basis of @xmath26 we have@xmath110 this shows that if we symmetrize the elements relative to the action of @xmath111 ( permuting the factors ) then the symmetric elements yield @xmath90 unambiguously . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> , we will view @xmath99 as a representation space of @xmath89 with the homomorphism @xmath112 for any @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> , for @xmath113 and @xmath114 . the hilbert space of the three qudits is denoted by @xmath115 , where the three colours correspond to the three dimensions @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> ]    our task is to find @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> the key observation is that the vector space @xmath99 is isomorphic to the vector space @xmath120 the isomorphism map ( which is a ` transpose'-type map ) maps the computational basis element @xmath121 to the basis element @xmath122 , where @xmath123 and for each @xmath124 , @xmath125 is the standard basis of @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> this map is an intertwining operator ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will denote it by @xmath127    quite remarkably , under this intertwining map , the problem of finding @xmath119 is reduced to finding @xmath128 for each @xmath108 . to see it , we use the same notation for the inverse map from @xmath129 to @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath130 denote the orthogonal projection of @xmath131 onto @xmath132 ( which is @xmath133 unless @xmath4 is divisible by @xmath134 the map @xmath135 is the orthogonal projection from @xmath99 onto @xmath136 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a simple consequence of the fact that a state being invariant under @xmath137 has to be in the span of @xmath138 , where @xmath139 are elements of @xmath140 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore left to compute @xmath130 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a classic problem in representation theory and can be solved using the schur - weyl duality . </S>",
    "<S> the schur - weyl duality relates the irreducible representations ( irreps ) of @xmath141 ( when acting on @xmath131 ) and the symmetric group on @xmath4 elements , @xmath142 ( with the natural action on @xmath131 ) . </S>",
    "<S> recall that @xmath4 must be of the form @xmath143 for some @xmath144 in order to have @xmath145 let @xmath146 be the character of @xmath111 corresponding to the partition of @xmath4 given by @xmath147 ( @xmath148 @xmath149 s ) . then </S>",
    "<S> ( see more details in the supplementary material ) , @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the dimension of the irrep corresponding to the partition @xmath152 . </S>",
    "<S> equations   and   determine the projection of @xmath99 onto @xmath119 , and thereby via eq .   provide the complete set of _ all _ slips of degree @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now give a simple example , illustrating how to use eq.([m2 ] ) to construct slips . </S>",
    "<S> more examples with more details can be found in the supplementary material . </S>",
    "<S> consider a system consisting of @xmath5 qudits each of dimension @xmath153 . the smallest degree possible in this case is @xmath114 for which @xmath154 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this case @xmath130 is a projection on @xmath155 . from eq .   </S>",
    "<S> we can define @xmath130 in terms of its action on basis elements as @xmath156 substituting this @xmath130 into eq.([m1 ] ) gives the degree @xmath157 invariant for an arbitrary number of @xmath5 qudits each of dimension four .    </S>",
    "<S> the number of terms in the sum of   is @xmath158 , which already for @xmath159 gives @xmath160 terms . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , using fundamental concepts from invariant theory , we find ( see supplementary material ) an alternative way to express all the slips of @xmath5 qubits . this alternative way ( which only applies for the qubit case ) is slightly more computationally efficient when @xmath4 is small . as an example we give an explicit formula for the unique slip of degree 6 in five qubits ( which can not be written in the form  ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our techniques also enable us to write down a simple algorithm to compute the dimension , @xmath161 , of the space of slips of degree @xmath4 in @xmath5 qubits . </S>",
    "<S> we get for example : @xmath162 in supplementary material we attach a program in mathematica that computes @xmath161 for large @xmath5 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in the more general case of @xmath5 _ qudits _ , with @xmath163 , the dimension @xmath161 of the space of slips of degree @xmath143 satisfies ( for @xmath164 ) @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the generalization of the @xmath167 catalan number ( see the supplementary material for more details ) . for @xmath114 ( which is only possible in the qubit @xmath168 case ) the limit above is 1/6 . </S>",
    "<S> the distinction between @xmath114 and @xmath164 follows from the fact that the alternating group on @xmath5 letters is simple ( i.e. without non - trivial normal subgroups ) if and only if @xmath164 . </S>",
    "<S> this formula indicates that the dimension of the space of slips grows exponentially both in @xmath5 and in @xmath4 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we showed that slips on @xmath5 qudits can be used to classify almost all slocc classes . </S>",
    "<S> we constructed a large class of elegant slips for the case of @xmath5 qubits and then introduced a general technique to construct all silps in all dimensions . instead of fixing the number of qudits and then trying to calculate all slips in any degree </S>",
    "<S> , we fixed the degree @xmath4 and then where able to calculate all slips of that degree in any number of qudits . </S>",
    "<S> this approach also enabled us to calculate the dimensions of the space of homogeneous slips of a given degree .    _ </S>",
