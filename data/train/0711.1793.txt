    "quantum fluctuations in the scalar field responsible for driving inflation can give rise to a power spectrum of primordial density perturbations consistent with what is required to seed the large - scale structure ( lss ) and the temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation . this fact is probably one of the main reasons for inflation having become a part of the concordance model of cosmology today .",
    "the quantum fluctuations are imprinted during the early inflationary epoch , and become classical fluctuations in the gravitational potential as the fluctuations leave the causal horizon . the standard way of calculating the power spectrum of the density fluctuations make use of the fact that space - time becomes minkowskian in the distant past .",
    "however , it has been argued @xcite that since a given length scale observable in the universe today shrinks and becomes smaller than the planck length if followed sufficiently far back in time , effects of quantum gravity will at some point play a role in setting up the perturbations , and may potentially leave an observable signature .",
    "the primordial density fluctuations in the early universe may have small oscillations superimposed as a result of quantum gravitational effects .",
    "these effects are due to non - negligible curvature imposed by high energy densities in de sitter space during the early stages of inflation .",
    "several papers have suggested a generic shape of these effects @xcite in the form of small oscillations superimposed on the standard , nearly scale - invariant primordial power spectrum of density fluctuations .",

    "however , this conclusion has been called into question in @xcite .",

    ", we revisit the question of the observability of transplanckian effects in the cmb , using a more accurate numerical treatment than in @xcite .",

    "the conclusion of @xcite is that there exist statistical justification for a presence of oscillations in the power spectrum .",
    "it should however be noted that the authors of @xcite treat the _ amplitude _ of the oscillations as a free parameter , which ensures the fitting of the cosmic variance outliers with the transplanckian oscillations .",

    "the conclusion of @xcite was that cmb and lss data are in principle sensitive to transplanckian modulations in the primordial power spectrum , but that is practically impossible to make a positive detection even in future high - precision data .",

    "it should however be possible to implement the sa - method in cosmomc when using simulated high - precision data in order to detect the transplanckian parameters .",
    "we have in this paper shown that it is very unlikely that cmb - data could support the establishment of transplanckian effects , even for models where quantum gravity is relevant on relatively low energy scales , like in the horava - witten model .",
    "there are several reasons for this lamentable conclusion :    * a low quantum gravity scale , for example the value @xmath46 chosen in our simulations , gives a very low amplitude of the oscillations in the primordial power spectrum .",
    "hence , cosmic variance diffuses the ( assumed noiseless ) signal .",
    "* evidence can maximally rise above @xmath107 , showing that the transplanckian model is only very weakly preferred when assuming a horava - witten universe .",
    "* even large ( and unphysical ) values of @xmath38 will result in good fits for singular points due to the behaviour of the oscillations ( they periodically reach zero when @xmath65 ) + * the conventional mcmc - methods in cosmomc fails , and we have no current computational methods implemented for solving the problem of transversing the extremely complicated likelihood surface ."
