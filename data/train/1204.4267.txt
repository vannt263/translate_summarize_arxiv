    "often invoked in the past in case of unexplained peculiarities , the role of magnetic fields has long been a subject of debate in the massive star community . indeed , on the theoretical side , these stars lack the convective envelopes thought to be responsible for the magnetic dynamo in late - type stars whereas , on the observational side , line dilution due to bright companions , spectral contamination by emission , and the relative rarity and breadth of spectral lines limit the detectability of magnetic zeeman signatures in hot stars . at the beginning of this century , only one half - dozen hot stars ( i.e. with spectral types of at least b2 ) had been confidently detected to be magnetic ; the earliest of this sample was only of spectral type b1.5 . in the last decade , however , the situation has improved dramatically thanks to the advent of efficient spectropolarimeters attached to mid- and large - size telescopes ( such as e.g. fors at the eso vlt or espadons at the cfht ) .",
    "these instruments led to the detection of magnetic fields in about 30 hot stars ( for a few recent cases : @xcite ) .",
    "the role of magnetic fields in massive stars has thus been re - assessed .",
    "while @xcite focused on understanding their effect on the structure and evolution of massive stars , @xcite had unveiled their impact on the stellar winds and therefore on the x - ray emission of massive stars . in a seminal paper",
    ", they proposed a semi - analytic model for magnetically channeled wind shocks wherein a strong dipole magnetic field guides the stellar winds from two opposite hemispheres towards the magnetic equator where the flows collide : the gas is heated up to high temperatures , leading to hard x - ray emission .",
    "such channelling can naturally lead to a shock - heated equatorial region .",
    "this model was first developed and applied to explain the peculiar x - ray emission of the magnetic and chemically peculiar bp star iqaur .",
    "following the work of @xcite , it was extended to explain the peculiarities of the o7 star @xmath1oric @xcite .",
    "self - consistent numerical magnetohydrodynamic models by @xcite further explored the wind - field interaction in hot stars , ultimately establishing @xmath1oric as a prototype for which the 15d modulations of the h@xmath2 , uv , and x - ray emissions are well explained by a magnetic oblique rotator model .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have shown that in the presence of significant stellar rotation , centrifugal support can lead to a stable accumulation of material near the magnetic equator .",
    "the best example here is the bp star @xmath0orie , for which the magnetic energy is so strong compared to the stellar wind energy that the magnetosphere extends to many stellar radii @xcite . for both cases",
    ", the x - ray emission appears very peculiar , as it is altogether bright and hard .",
    "indeed , `` normal '' o - type stars have relatively soft x - ray emission ( @xmath3kev ) of a well - defined strength ( the so - called canonical relation , @xmath4$]@xmath5 , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "both @xmath1oric and @xmath0orie therefore seem to comply reasonably well with model expectations for magnetically confined winds .",
    "it must however be noted that , while bright and hard x - ray emission may be considered as a good hint for the presence of magnetic fields , the contrary is not necessarily true .",
    "indeed , some magnetic objects display soft x - ray emission : this is notably the case of of?p stars ( see e.g. @xcite ) and some b stars ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "while the overall x - ray luminosity of these objects follows rather well the expected values , it is clearly not the case of their plasma temperature @xcite , a fact which currently remains unexplained .",
    "the chandra x - ray observatory has recently performed a large - scale survey of the carina nebula ( cccp , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this led to the detection of @xmath614000 x - ray sources @xcite , among which a majority of pms objects and @xmath6100 massive , hot stars @xcite . amongst the latter ones",
    ", we selected those that display unusually hard and bright x - ray emission , hence were good candidates for harbouring magnetically - confined winds . using fors",
    ", we perform a small spectropolarimetric survey of these objects , with the aim of finding new cases of magnetically - confined winds .",
    "this paper reports on the results of this campaign .",
    "it first presents the observations ( sect .",
    "2 ) , then the results ( sect .",
    "3 ) , to finally summarize and conclude in sect .",
    "a total of eight fields in the carina nebula were observed in spectropolarimetric mode with the fors2 instrument @xcite of the eso vlt during a visitor run in march 2011 .",
    "the choice of the main targets was initially made on the basis of their x - ray emission ( cccp , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "we selected brightmag ] early - type stars with high x - ray luminosity ( coll228 - 68 , hd93250 , tr16 - 5 , 11 , 22 and 64 ) , with a strong hard x - ray component ( hd93250 , hd93501 , ls1865 , coll228 - 68 , tr16 - 5 , 10 , 11 , 22 and 64 ) or with known long - term x - ray variability ( hd93250 , tr16 - 22 ) .",
    "those characteristics are compatible with those expected from magnetically - confined winds , explaining our choice for this investigation .",
    "four fields studied only a single target , because of the lack of nearby massive stars with similar magnitudes : hd93250 , hd93501 , hd93190 , and tr16 - 22 .",
    "the four other fields were taken in multi - object mode , since such adequate neighbours existed : the first one contains coll228 - 66 , coll228 - 68 , and hd93097 , the second one tr16 - 10 , 11 and 14 , the third one ls1865 , ls1853 , hd305524 , and hd305534 , and the last one tr16 - 2 , 4 , 5 , 13 , 15 , 64 , and 115 .",
    "the 11 additional objects are field stars which do not show particularly exceptional x - ray characteristics .    in total , 21 ob stars were thus investigated .",
    "our observing run was allocated 10hours , that were distributed over three consecutive nights ( 2011 march 1214 ) .",
    "this allowed us to observe about half of our targets on two different nights . during our observing run , the blue ccd ( a mosaic composed of two 2k@xmath74k e2v chips )",
    "read without any binning , a slit of 1 and the 1200b grating ( @xmath8 ) were used .",
    "we adopted for each field an observing sequence of 8 or 16 subexposures with retarder waveplate positions of @xmath9 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath10 , ... duration of individual subexposures ranges from 10 to 300s , depending on the targets luminosity and the variable seeing .",
    "it was therefore adjusted several times during the run , to remain close , but below , the saturation level ( spectropolarimetric investigations requiring the highest possible signal - to - noise ratio ) .      in recent years , there has been some debate in the literature about the reality of some magnetic field detections claimed using the fors instruments . to settle the debate ,",
    "@xcite has performed an overall reduction of all spectropolarimetric fors datasets .",
    "they notably show the implications of some data reduction choices and we took into account the considerations made in that work .    using the observing sequence described above , the normalized stokes @xmath11 profile can be determined , as well as a diagnostic `` null '' profile @xcite : + @xmath12 \\\\[2 mm ] { \\ensuremath{n_v}}= n / i & = & { 1",
    "\\over 2 n } \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^n ( -1)^{(j-1)}\\left [   \\left(\\frac{{\\ensuremath{f^\\parallel}}- { \\ensuremath{f^\\perp}}}{{\\ensuremath{f^\\parallel}}+ { \\ensuremath{f^\\perp}}}\\right)_{-45^\\circ } -   \\left(\\frac{{\\ensuremath{f^\\parallel}}- { \\ensuremath{f^\\perp}}}{{\\ensuremath{f^\\parallel}}+ { \\ensuremath{f^\\perp}}}\\right)_{+45^\\circ}\\right]\\ ; , \\\\ \\end{array } \\label{eq_v_and_n}\\ ] ] where @xmath13  and @xmath14  are the counts recorded for the parallel and perpendicular beams , respectively , @xmath15 is the simple sum of all @xmath13  and @xmath14  spectra , and @xmath16 is the number of pairs of subexposures ( i.e. sets of @xmath17 , @xmath18 observations ) . to get the @xmath13  and @xmath14  for each target , the data were corrected for bias but not flat - fielded , since there is no evidence that flatfielding improves the magnetic field determination @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spectra were extracted using a simple aperture extraction since , in practice , optimal extraction applied to high signal - to - noise ratio leads to noisier spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the aperture extraction radius was fixed to 12px for data taken on the first and third night , and between 15 and 24px ( depending on the actual seeing ) for data taken during the second night .",
    "note that sky background was subtracted for each spectrum and @xmath19 , or @xmath20 and @xmath21 when the seeing was bad or a companion existed - only one of these regions being used if the star was too close to a slit edge ) . ] .",
    "finally , wavelength calibration was made by considering arc lamp data taken at only one retarder waveplate position ( in our case , @xmath22 ) for all science frames of a given field , whatever the position of the retarder waveplate actually is for them .",
    "as shown by @xcite , this minimizes spurious polarization signals .",
    "note that , indeed , wavelength calibration remains specific to the actual position of the spectra on the ccd , i.e. it is different from one object to the next as well as for the parallel and perpendicular beams . in all cases ,",
    "the final , calibrated spectra have 5813px with a step of 0.43  ( close to the dispersion value ) and a start wavelength of 3500.215 , as recommended for this grating .",
    "whenever it was possible , we reduced our data using two different procedures . for the data obtained in",
    " fast mode \" ( i.e. single target ) , we used both the fors pipeline and standard iraf routines ( for master bias creation ) , @xmath23 ( for spectrum extraction ) , and @xmath24 ( for wavelength calibration , using the wavelength list from the fors manual which is available at http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/fors/doc/ ) . ] . however , the fors pipeline only accepts datasets with a pair of frames obtained with the retarder waveplate at @xmath9 and @xmath10 , or a quadruplet with retarder waveplate at the position angles @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "since we adopted a different observing strategy ( 8 or 16 subexposures taken at two angles , rather than a single pair , see above ) , we had to combine our 8 or 16 subexposures into 4 or 8 pairs , to reduce these pairs separately , and finally to make use of external procedures to combine the pipeline products into a single result for each 8 or 16 subexposure dataset .",
    "moreover , for polarimetric data obtained in multi - object mode , we could use only iraf routines , because the fors pipeline fails to associate the pairs of beams pertaining to individual objects . in the end ,",
    "the spectra reduced within iraf appeared very similar to those reduced with the fors pipeline , when they existed , though the former ones seem slightly less noisy .",
    "this is explained by bad seeing , and by the position of the spectra , which , even in `` fast '' mode , were found very close to gaps between slitlets .",
    "these problems could be better dealt with through manual fine tuning of extraction and background substraction , than with the pipeline semi - automatic mode .",
    "nevertheless , we decided to use also the fors pipeline to check our results in two independent ways . in a final step ,",
    "the longitudinal magnetic field was estimated by minimising the expression @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath28 takes a different value for each spectral point , @xmath29 is a constant accounting for possible spurious residual polarization in the continuum , @xmath30 is either @xmath31  or @xmath32  at the wavelength @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , with @xmath35@xmath36g@xmath36 and @xmath37 the effective land factor , assumed to be 1 near the balmer lines of hydrogen and 1.2 elsewhere .    in this equation ,",
    "@xmath38 was evaluated through @xmath39 , as by @xcite , while the error on @xmath31  is estimated through @xmath40 ( see eq .",
    "a6 of * ? ? ?",
    "following the fors pipeline manual , the error on each spectrum ( @xmath13  or @xmath14 ) amounts to @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the flux at the wavelength @xmath33 and @xmath43 is the gain in electrons per adu ( 0.53 or 0.58 , depending on the ccd chip ) - the read - out noise is neglected because of its small value compared to the high level of the stellar flux .",
    "note that the fors pipeline accounts for the error introduced by background subtraction and by the extraction , whereas for data reduced with iraf routines we considered only the contribution due to photon - noise .",
    "a few additional remarks must be made at this stage .",
    "first , we have estimated the magnetic field for the `` raw '' @xmath31  and @xmath32  profiles , and for the same @xmath31  and @xmath32  profiles rectified using a fourier filter of width 300px @xcite .",
    "that correction results only in a minimal difference ( about 15 g on average ) , well within the error bars ( typically 80 g ) , confirming the results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their table 2 ) .",
    "second , some values of the @xmath31  and @xmath32  profiles were discarded : the 3% bluest and 3% reddest of the wavelength range with recorded data , as well as the spectral bins where @xmath32  deviates more than 3@xmath0 from zero ( and the two adjacent bins ) , as in @xcite . in addition",
    ", we did not consider the spectral bins with @xmath44 outside the range @xmath45 , @xmath46 , as they were small in number and erratic in value but dominating the slope determination .",
    "third , we derived magnetic field values for the full spectral range and for selected spectral windows ( avoiding continuum regions , or regions affected by ism / nebular features , see online material in appendix ) . again , this results in small changes ( about 45 g on average ) , within the error bars .",
    "finally , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) found several hints that the error bars of the magnetic field determinations made using the fors instrument were underestimated .",
    "therefore , the error on @xmath47 , derived as is usual from the linear interpolation , was corrected following the method of @xcite , to take into account the actual scattering around the fitted line .",
    "this correcting factor is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the minimum value of the @xmath50 derived as in eq .",
    "( [ eq_chisquare ] ) and @xmath51 is the number of degrees of freedom of the system ( i.e. , the number of spectral points minus two ) .",
    "the derived values of the longitudinal fields for all targets are listed in table [ result ] , which also gives for comparison the @xmath52  values found from the null profiles . for comparison purposes , values with or without rectification , for the full spectral range or considering only specific spectral windows",
    "are given .",
    "spectral types and x - ray luminosity , reproduced from @xcite , are also shown .",
    "several conclusions can now be drawn .    first , even though the fors pipeline results are about 10 - 15% noisier then those obtained with manual data reduction , all results are consistent with each other ( i.e. the conclusion of a detection or a non - detection is found with both methods ) , and the field values are within 2@xmath0 error bars of each other .",
    "second , the diagnostic @xmath47  derived from the null profile are consistent with zero ( at the 3@xmath0 level in the worst cases , most often at the 1@xmath0 level ) , as is expected , confirming the quality of our data reduction .",
    "finally , and most importantly , two stars shows a magnetic field detection at the 6@xmath0 level and with a strength @xmath6300 g , two features suggesting a true detection @xcite .",
    "the other 19 stars have @xmath47  compatible with zero at the 3@xmath0 level , as do the diagnostic profiles .",

    "a monitoring is now needed to further constrain the stellar , wind , and magnetospheric properties which would enable us to perform a full modelling of this star . in this context , we have examined the single archival feros spectrum of tr16 - 22 .",
    "this spectrum appears quite similar to that of the sharp - lined magnetic o9.5iv star hd57682 @xcite , though the lines of tr16 - 22 seem even narrower than those of hd57682 . a long period for tr16 - 22 would not be surprising , as an intense field is able to brake the rotation of massive stars with strong stellar winds @xcite . indeed , many magnetic o stars are slow rotators ( see e.g. the extreme cases of 538d for hd191612 or even 55yrs for hd108 , @xcite ) .",
    "the feros spectrum also reveals a strong emission component in h@xmath2  and a p cygni profile for hei5876  ( fig .",

    "this reinforces our suspicion that tr16 - 22 shows several evidence for the presence of magnetically confined winds .",
    "this object displays a clear magnetic detection ( table [ result ] and fig .",

    "nevertheless , the obtained field values clearly differ between the actual stokes v profile and the null profile , leaving little doubt on the detection .",
    "spectra of targets observed at the edge of the field of view may be slightly depolarized @xcite , but this problem would decrease the absolute field value , rather than causing a spurious detection , thus we are confident in our result .",

    "a magnetic field is indeed required in this system , to explain the synchrotron radio emission of the system . however , the nature and origin of the field - whether associated directly to the star(s ) or produced within the shock - is unclear . considering the first case , it is true that our observations do not detect any organized field at the photosphere , but it must be noted that a low inclination of the star s magnetic axis or its binary nature could impact on our detection capabilities .",
    "moreover , the derived 3@xmath0 limit on the longitudinal field of hd93250 is about 300 g , and no theoretical expectation has been published to which we could compare this value . depending on the exact stellar and wind properties ( which are not known with precision ) , as well as local characteristics of the wind collision zone ( equally unknown ) , which may produce a field amplification @xcite , it may well be that our non - detection of an organized magnetic field is not at odds with the presence of the @xmath2781 g field needed at the collision zone to generate some non - thermal radio emission .",
    "following the detection of hard and bright x - rays in a handful of early - type stars in the carina nebula , we performed a small spectropolarimetric survey of 21 massive stars in the region using the fors instrument .",
    "previously , only 7 ob stars in carina ( hd93128 , hd93129b , hd93204 , hd93403 , hd93843 , hd303308 , hd303311 ) had been examined by @xcite , alas with no clear detection and only one 3@xmath0 detection ( which is a low detection level for fors data , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with this paper ,",
    "we have quadrupled the number of carina massive stars searched for magnetic fields . for 19 objects ,",
    "we could put limits of a few hundreds gauss on magnetic fields , but two objects led to a clear ( 6@xmath0 ) detection : tr16 - 22 ( @xmath279 g ) and tr16 - 13 ( @xmath280 g ) .",
    "though the late - o star tr16 - 22 could have a companion , its hard , variable x - ray emission appears too bright to originate in a wind - wind collision inside the binary .",
    "the magnetic field detection ( confirmed by two independent observations ) rather supports a scenario where magnetically - confined winds collide at the magnetic equator , thereby producing copious hard x - ray emission .",
    "an independent confirmation comes from its strong h@xmath2  emission , similar to that observed in other magnetic cases ( the of?p stars and @xmath1oric ) . with its peculiar x - ray properties , tr16 - 22 may thus be seen as an analog to the famous @xmath1oric , the best example amongst magnetic o - stars for a good match with theoretical expectations , especially in the x - ray range @xcite : as a potential second case , tr16 - 22 appears as a key in our understanding of confined winds .",
    "a full monitoring of this star ( x - ray , spectroscopy , spectropolarimetry , ... ) is thus urgently needed .",
    "tr16 - 13 is a poorly known star with no known peculiarities and rather faint x - ray emission .",
    "certainly , more investigation is now needed to ascertain the impact of magnetic fields on its evolution and on its stellar wind .",
    "again , a dedicated monitoring is required to determine the physical parameters of the star as well as the magnetospheric properties , needed before any modelling can take place .",
