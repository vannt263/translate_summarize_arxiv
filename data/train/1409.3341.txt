    "[ schematic ] , when the photon pairs are produced at the surface @xmath42 , anti - stokes photon does not need to go through the atomic medium to arrive at the anti - stokes detector @xmath41 . for stokes photon , as @xmath73 and @xmath59 is approximately the wavevector in vacuum .",

    "when the photon pairs are produced at the other surface @xmath80 , the anti - stokes photon has to go through the medium with group velocity @xmath75 to reach detector @xmath41 , while the stokes photon does not have to travel through the medium in order to reach detector @xmath39 .",

    "when photon pairs are produced between @xmath82 to @xmath83 , the delay time is between 0 to @xmath84 .",
    "as every atom in the cloud has the same third - order susceptibility and experiences the same pump and coupling laser fields , the probability for producing the photon pairs in every point in the atomic medium is the same .",

    "the biphoton waveform depends on two factors : ( 1 ) the probability of biphoton generation by atoms in the atomic cloud , and ( 2 ) the time required for the photons to propagate through the atomic cloud to the detector .",
    "when the atomic distribution changes from uniform to non - uniform with a distribution , the probability of emitting photon pairs should follow this distribution .",
    "that is , in space where there are more atoms , the probability of emitting photons pairs increases . at the same time , the group velocity in this densely - populated space decreases and thus photons need more time to travel through this space to reach the detector . as the coincidence counting rate",
    "is in fact the probability of generating photon pairs divided by the time for the photons to reach the detector , the effect of longer travel time washes out that of the larger probability density . as a result , the biphoton waveform is not sensitive to the atomic density distribution profile .",
    "note that the above discussion is only valid when ( 1 ) atomic density varies in the longitudinal direction with the constraint that od is fixed and ( 2 ) the pump laser is weak and far - detuned .",
    "both conditions are of interests to our on - going experiments .",
    "if ( 1 ) is not satisfied but ( 2 ) is , our numerical analysis shows that the waveform will still be rectangle - like as in the case of uniform atomic density .",
