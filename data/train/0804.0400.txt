    "series expansions for selected values of the anisotropy for the spin - half and spin - one model are given in table  [ table 1 ] and table  [ table 2 ] respectively .",
    "the series are analyzed by integrated differential approximants ( ida)oitmaa2006 . before the analysis , a change of variable of the form @xmath29 has been introduced to remove leading singularities as @xmath30 .",

    "this value is clearly larger than the square - lattice case where @xmath32 .",
    "our results are more accurate away from the 1d limit , but they clearly appear to approach the 1d limit in a smooth and monotonic manner . for the spin - one case it is known that the nel order disappears at an anisotropy ratio of approximately @xmath33@xcite",
    ". the transition should be in the universality class of the 3d heisenberg model .",
    "the spin - stiffness should vanish at the transition with an exponent of @xmath34@xcite .",
    "the fit shows that the data agrees well with these expectations .",
    "for the spin - half case we also fit the small anisotropy regime to a linear behavior .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",

    "in this section we consider the self - consistent version of spin - wave theory@xcite . to apply this approach",

    "this difference is most probably due to topological excitations within the half - integer spin chains , which are not considered by spin - wave theory . for @xmath61 , at the transition to the haldane phase , we find the stiffness exponents to be @xmath64 and @xmath65 , in qualitative agreement with series expansions .    for @xmath62 ,",
    "a quantitative discrepancy between spin - wave theory and series expansions is visible already at small anisotropies .",
    "while series expansion and spin - wave stiffness along the weaker exchange couplings axis ( @xmath16 ) remain very close to each other , a discrepancy arises from the stiffness along the stronger coupling direction .",
    "we find the coefficient in the linear fit ( [ linearfit ] ) @xmath66 somewhat lower than what found by series expansion , as shown in fig  [ fig : alpha ] .",
    "it is possible that part of the difference is due to numerical inaccuracies or high order effects in @xmath67 .",

    "it becomes qualitative and it implies the onset of new physics for the spin - half case associated with the berry phase terms  @xcite .",
    "we base our considerations on the theory of underdoped cuprates suggested in ref .  .",
    "according to this theory , the ground state of an underdoped uniformly doped cuprate is a spin spiral , spontaneously directed along the ( 1,0 ) or the ( 0,1 ) direction . at",

    "@xmath21 is the concentration of holes in cuo@xmath9 plane . according to this picture ,",
    "the electronic liquid crystal observed in ref .",
    "is the mostly dynamic spin spiral which may still have some small static component . for sr",
    "doped la@xmath70cuo@xmath71 , the value of the critical concentration is @xmath72 , and for yba@xmath9cu@xmath10o@xmath73 is @xmath74 .",
    "the absolute value of the wave vector of the spin spiral ( static or dynamic ) is given by @xmath75 here @xmath76 is the spin - stiffness of the initial heisenberg model  @xcite , @xmath77 is the antiferromagnetic exchange parameter of the model , and @xmath78 is the coupling constant for the interaction between mobile holes and spin waves .",
    "we set the spacing of the tetragonal lattice equal to unity , so the the wave vector @xmath79 is dimensionless .",
    "to fit the neutron scattering experimental data to the position of the incommensurate structure in sr doped single layer la@xmath70cuo@xmath71 , we need to set @xmath80 , and to fit similar data for double layer yba@xmath9cu@xmath10o@xmath81 , we need to set @xmath82 .",
    "it is not clear yet why the values of @xmath78 for these compounds are slightly different , but for purposes of the present work this difference is not important .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath78 was calculated within the extended t - j model @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the nearest site hopping matrix element and @xmath85 is the quasihole residue .",
    "it is known that in cuprates @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "thus the calculated value of the coupling constant , @xmath80 , agrees well with that found by fitting of experimental data .",
    "the ground state energy of the spin spiral state consists of two parts .",
    "the spin spiral with the wave vector @xmath79 gives rise to the gain @xmath88 in the kinetic energy of a single hole .",
    "on the other hand the spiral costs the spin elastic energy @xmath89 .",
    "so the total balance is @xmath90 , and minimization with respect to @xmath79 gives the wave vector ( [ q ] ) and the energy per elementary cell @xmath91 there are also quantum corrections to this energy , but they are small and hence not important for our purposes@xcite .",
    "note , that eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) is valid for both @xmath92 and @xmath93 , assuming that @xmath21 is not large .    up to now",
    "we have disregarded the anisotropy assuming a perfect square lattice . to analyze anisotropy in the spiral direction we have to replace @xmath94 where @xmath95 is due to the lattice deformation , so @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the antiferromagnetic exchange , @xmath98 , also becomes anisotropic , @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "hence the spin - stiffness is replaced by @xmath101 , where @xmath102 has been calculated above .",
    "now we can see how the lattice deformation influences the spiral energy ( [ e1 ] ) . in the case when @xmath103 is directed along the @xmath104",
    "we have to replace in ( [ e1 ] ) @xmath105 and @xmath106 ; and in the case when @xmath103 is directed along the @xmath107 we have to replace in ( [ e1 ] ) @xmath108 and @xmath109",
    ". note that the quasiparticle residue @xmath85 is a scalar property and therefore it is independent of direction of @xmath103 .",

    "interestingly , without the spin - quantum - fluctuations effect ( i. e. if @xmath113 ) the anisotropy in energy disappears .    since @xmath114 it is most natural to assume that @xmath115 , this means that @xmath116 .",
    "this point is supported by the lda calculation performed in ref .  .",
    "in this case , according to eq .",
    "( e2 ) , the energy of the state with @xmath111 along the @xmath13-axis is higher than that with @xmath111 along the @xmath117-axis .",
    "this disagrees with the experimental data in ref .  .",
    "however , the anisotropy of the hopping matrix element @xmath84 is not straightforward .",
    "there are two competing contributions to @xmath95 .",
    "the first one is related to the lattice deformation and is positive .",
    "the second one is related to oxygen chains that are present in yba@xmath9cu@xmath10o@xmath11 and is negative . in principle",
    "it is possible for the negative contribution to win , making @xmath95 negative  @xcite .",
    "the neutron scattering anisotropy has been previously discussed within the pomeranchuk instability scenario  @xcite .",
    "this is probably not sufficient to explain the newest data , see discussion in ref .",
    "yamase2 . however , it is interesting to note that , to explain the sign of the pinning , the pomeranchuk scenario also requires a negative @xmath95 .",
    "anyway , for further numerical estimates , we will assume @xmath118 the absolute value is consistent with the 1% lattice deformation and the sign has been discussed above . in this case , according to eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) , the energy of the state with @xmath111 along the @xmath13-axis is lower and this is consistent with experimental data .",
    "the direction of pinning energy at @xmath119 reads @xmath120 this is the pinning energy per cu site and it is a pretty strong pinning . for comparison ,",
    "the pinning energy of spin to the orthorhombic b - direction in undoped la@xmath70cuo@xmath71 is just @xmath121 .",
    "assuming that the correlation length is at least comparable with the period of the spin spiral , @xmath122 , we find that the total pinning energy per correlation unit is @xmath123 , which is a significant energy scale .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the spin - stiffness constants for spatially anisotropic spin - half and spin - one heisenberg models using series expansions and self - consistent spin - wave theory .",
    "the theoretical results have been of interest in themselves and show the importance of berry phase interference terms in anisotropic square - lattice models .",
    "our primary motivation for the study has been to understand the phenomena of electronic liquid crystal and its pinning in high temperature superconductors .",
    "we find that quantum interference effects significantly enhance the spin - stiffness anisotropy and this can provide the primary mechanism for the pinning of the liquid crystal direction .",
