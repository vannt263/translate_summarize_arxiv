    "there are currently 294 supernova remnants ( snrs ) known in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "these are an important source of the injection of energy and heavy elements into the interstellar medium , and are believed to be the site of acceleration of cosmic rays , at least up to @xmath1  ev ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "consequently the distribution of snrs in the galaxy is of interest for a variety of studies of the galaxy ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is not straightforward to construct a galactic distribution directly from properties of catalogued snrs .",
    "this is not only because distances are not available for most galactic snrs , but also because of the observational selection effects that apply to the current catalogue of snrs .",
    "it is expected @xcite that most snrs are from massive stars ( i.e.  types ii / ib / ic ) , which also produce pulsars , and hence the distribution of snrs will be closely related to that of star forming regions or pulsars .    some statistics of the current galactic snr catalogue , the selection effects that apply to their identification , and issues related to the derivation of distances to individual snrs from the ` @xmath0 ' relation are discussed in section  [ s : background ] .",
    "section  [ s : radial ] presents constraints on the galactic distribution of snrs from comparison of the @xmath2-distribution of bright snrs with various models .",
    "this includes comparison with the distribution from @xcite ( 1998 ) , hereafter cb98 ( see also ) , which has been widely used .",
    "the conclusions are summarised in section  [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "preliminary results have been presented in @xcite , but here a more detailed analysis is made .",
    "i have produced several catalogues of galactic snrs , with published versions in , and also various versions online since 1993 .",
    "of the 294 remnants in the most recent version of the catalogue , most have been first identified at radio wavelengths , or  if identified at other wavebands  have subsequently been detected at radio wavelengths .",
    "but there are 22 remnants in the catalogue that have not yet been detected at radio wavelengths , or not sufficiently well observed to provide an integrated radio flux density . at optical and x - ray wavelengths",
    "only about 40% and 30% , respectively , of the catalogued snrs have been detected ( which is not surprising , due to galactic absorption that affects these wavelengths ) .",
    "thus , it is selection effects at radio wavelengths that are dominant when considering the completeness of the catalogue .",
    "figure  [ f : h - year ] shows a histogram of the date of inclusion of a remnant in the catalogue ( the larger number of entries in the first version of the catalogue , from 1984 , were largely taken from earlier galactic snr catalogues ) .",
    "this shows that major radio surveys have been the cause of significant increases in the identification of galactic snrs , notably :    1 .   the effelsberg 2.7-ghz survey , covering @xmath3 , @xmath4 , with a resolution of @xmath5  arcmin ; 2 .",
    "the most 843-ghz survey @xcite , covering @xmath6 , @xmath7 , with a resolution of @xmath8  arcmin at best ; 3 .",
    "@xcite s survey of a small region of the 1st galactic quadrant ",
    "@xmath9  at multiple radio wavelengths , with a resolution of @xmath10  arcmin at 327  mhz , which also used infrared observations to help discriminate between different types of sources .    in the latest revision of the galactic snr catalogue",
    ", 21 new remnants were added to the catalogue . of these 13 have an integrated radio flux density at 1  ghz in the catalogue , and hence a surface brightness",
    ", @xmath11 can be calculated ; all of these 13 remnants are faint , with @xmath12 .",
    "the other 8 newly catalogued remnants do not yet have radio flux densities reported in the literature , as they were identified at optical or x - ray wavelengths ( e.g.  ( 38.7)-(1.3 ) , ( 65.8)-(0.5 ) , ( 66.0)-(0.0 ) , ( 67.6)-(0.0 ) , ( 67.6)+(0.9 ) and ( 67.8)+(0.5 ) were identified from optical observations by @xcite  for these snrs integrated radio flux densities have not been yet published ) .",
    ", of the catalogued galactic snrs ( there are also 10 large remnants with angular sizes greater than @xmath13 which are not included in this plot).,width=321 ]    in order to derive directly the distribution of snrs in the galaxy both : ( i ) correction for the incompleteness of the current catalogue of snrs due to observational selection effects , and ( ii ) knowledge of the distances to each known snr is required .",
    "i discuss below the selection effects that apply , at radio wavelengths , to the current snr catalogue , and also some issues with the derivation of distances to individual snrs using the ` @xmath0 ' relation .",
    "as noted above , most galactic snrs are identified at radio wavelengths , and the selection effects that apply  as discussed previously , e.g.@xcite  are ( i ) intrinsically faint remnants ( i.e.  low surface brightness ) are difficult to identify , and ( ii ) physically small but distant remnants are difficult to recognise as snrs , due to their small angular sizes .",
    "i have previously argued @xcite for a nominal surface brightness completeness limit of @xmath14 .",
    "( which is equivalent to @xmath15  mjy per 1-arcmin circular beam )",
    ". however , a higher limit probably applies close to the galactic centre ( gc ) , where the background galactic radio emission is brighter than elsewhere .",
    "the validity of this value for the approximate surface brightness completeness of the current snr catalogue is discussed further below .",
    "in addition to the difficulty of identifying low - surface brightness snrs , it is also difficult to identify small angular size remnants .",
    "for example , the effelsberg 2.7-ghz survey has a resolution of 4.3  arcmin , and snrs would have to be several times this angular size for their structure to be recognised .",
    "@xcite reported 32 new supernova remnants in the first part of the area covered by the effelsberg 2.7-ghz survey ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , subsequently published in ) .",
    "of these 30 are resolved , with angular diameters of 16  arcmin or more , i.e.  several times the resolution of the survey .",
    "the other two sources have small angular size , and were thought to be snrs on the basis of other , higher resolution targeted observations : ( i ) ( 54.1)+(0.3 ) , then thought to be a small , @xmath18  arcmin ` filled centre ' remnant ( see ) , but is now catalogued as a slightly larger @xmath19  arcmin composite remnant , since a faint x - ray halo was detected by , and ( ii ) ( 70.7)+(1.2 ) , which was reported as a snr by , but this identification was not supported by subsequent observations ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "given that snrs are expected to have a continuous range of physical diameters , and are seen at a range of distances in the galaxy , then a smooth distribution of angular sizes is expected .",
    "figure  [ f : h - size ] shows a histogram of the angular size , @xmath20 , of catalogued snrs , which clearly shows a sharp decrease at small angular sizes ( @xmath21  arcmin ) , due to the difficulty in identifying small snrs .",

    "the fainter remnants are more easily detected in regions where the galactic background emission is fainter , i.e.  away from @xmath33 and @xmath32 , which is illustrated in figs  [ f : s - lb ] and [ f : s - sigmal ] .",
    "figure  [ f : s - lb ] shows the distribution in galactic coordinates of ( a ) all remnants , and ( b ) the 69 ` bright ' remnants .",
    "the distribution of all remnants , without taking the surface brightness effect into account , is very much broader in both coordinates than that of the bright remnants ( the r.m.s .",

    "figure  [ f : s - sigmal ] shows the surface brightness and galactic longitude of the 272 catalogued snrs with radio flux densities . in the galactic anti - centre ( i.e.  the 2nd and 3rd galactic quadrants )  where the galactic background is low ",
    "there is a higher proportion of low surface brightness snrs .",
    "figure  [ f : h - sigma](b ) and ( c ) show that the majority of snrs identified in the effelsberg 2.7  ghz survey region from subsequent other observations are fainter than the nominal surface brightness limit .",
    "however , there are 6 snrs above the surface brightness limit , which have subsequently been identified , see table  [ t : sigma - post92 ] ( some of these had been suggested as possible snrs earlier ) .",
    "these 6 remnants are all close to the galactic centre , or are small angular size , so would not have been well resolved in the effelsberg 2.7  ghz survey , which is necessary to be recognised as a snr .",
    "a surface brightness completeness limit of @xmath40 is also consistent with observations made by .",
    "their observations covered @xmath41 , @xmath42 at 5  ghz , and they used other radio and infra - red observations to separate non - thermal and thermal components .",
    "this multi - wavelength approach should allow fainter remnants to be recognised than is possible using a single observation frequency .",
    "they concluded that there were no large , i.e.  sufficiently resolved , remnants with @xmath43 in the region they observed .",
    "figure  [ f : l - dist - o ] shows the distribution of snrs with galactic longitude . for all snrs , fig .",
    "[ f : l - dist - o](a ) shows a clear asymmetry on different sides of @xmath32 , with more snrs identified in the 1st and 2nd quadrants .",
    "this is because ( i ) the 1st and 2nd quadrants are accessible to a large number of northern hemisphere telescopes , and ( ii ) they include the deep , multiwavelength survey of @xmath9 by @xcite , as discussed in section  [ s : background ] .",
    "the sample of 69 ` bright ' snrs , fig .",
    "[ f : l - dist - o](b ) , shows a much smaller asymmetry close to @xmath44 , but this is not statistically significant ( 4 in the region @xmath45 , and 8  including ( 0.0)+(0.0 ) in the region @xmath46 ) . by galactic quadrants ,",
    "the numbers of bright snrs are : 35 in the 1st , 3 in the 2nd , 2 in the 3rd , and 29 in the 4th .",
    "these , with poisson errors , do not show any asymmetry between either side of the galactic centre .",
    "this implies that the nominal completeness surface brightness cutoff , although derived from the effelsberg 2.7-ghz  which misses almost all of the 4th quadrant  is applicable there .",
    "figure  [ f : l - dist - o ] again shows that the distribution of the ` bright ' snrs is more localised towards @xmath32 than the distribution of all catalogued snrs .",
    "although distance determinations are available for some galactic snrs  e.g.  @xcite give a compilation of distances to 60 snrs from the literature  the @xmath0 relation has been used for some time ( e.g.  ) to determine distances for other remnants .",
    "this is based on the fact that , for remnants with known distances , the observed surface brightness ( @xmath11 ) is larger for snrs with smaller physical diameters ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this correlation is parameterised as @xmath48 i.e.  a straight line in the @xmath49 plane , with @xmath50 and @xmath51 determined from the properties of snrs with known distances , the _ observed _ surface brightness , @xmath11  which is distance - independent  for a remnant without a distance determination can then be used to determine its physical diameter , @xmath47 .",
    "hence via its _ observed _ angular size , @xmath20 , its distance @xmath52 can be determined .",
    "however  as previously discussed @xcite  there is a large scatter in the observed @xmath0 distribution of snrs , about an order of magnitude in @xmath47 for a given @xmath11 . in addition ,",
    "small and/or faint snrs are more likely to have been missed in current surveys , and be missing from the current galactic snr catalogue , due to the observational selection effects discussed in [ s : selection ] .",
    "so , the true range of diameters for a given surface brightness may extend to lower diameters .",
    "( on the other hand , for a given surface brightness the upper limit to the range of diameters is not affected by selection effects , at least down to the nominal surface brightness limit of current catalogues . )",
    "although the upper - right boundary of the observed @xmath0 distribution of snrs with known distances is useful to provide an upper limit on the diameter of an individual snr , distances for individual snrs derived from the @xmath0 relation are imprecise .",
    "leaving aside issues with selection effects , if a @xmath0 relation is to be used statistically to derive distances to individual snrs from their surface brightness , care has to be taken to use the appropriate form of regression @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0 relation is used to derive @xmath47 from @xmath11 then a regression that minimises square deviations in @xmath53 should be used , _ not _ a regression than minimises square deviations in @xmath54 . for distributions with a large spread  as is the case for snrs with known distances ",
    "different regressions give significantly different fits ( see @xcite and @xcite for discussion of different forms of least square regressions ) .",
    "cb98 derived a @xmath0 relation with @xmath55 using 37 galactic ` shell ' snrs with known distances ( or @xmath56 if cas  a ( = ( 111.7)-(2.1 ) ) is excluded ) .",
    "cb98 comment that these @xmath0 slopes are significantly flatter than those derived in previous studies , e.g.  @xcite obtained @xmath57 .",
    "it is evident , however , that cb98 minimised square deviations in @xmath54 , whereas @xcite minimised square deviations in @xmath53 , so these @xmath0 slopes are not directly comparable .",
    "re - fitting the snrs with known distances used by cb98 , minimising deviations in @xmath53 rather than @xmath54 produces much steeper @xmath0 slopes , which _ are _ in good agreement with earlier results ( e.g.  those of @xcite ) . for all 37 ` shell ' snrs @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 if cas  a is excluded ) .",
    "this difference in the slope of the derived @xmath0 relation depending on the form of regression used has an important consequence for the galactic snr distribution derived by cb98 .",
    "there is a systematic bias in the diameters and hence distances derived for snrs , with fainter / brighter snrs having distances that are too large / small respectively .",
    "since there are more faint snrs than bright snrs , then the derived distribution of snrs in the galaxy will be systematically spread out too . in @xmath0 studies in the literature",
    "it is not always clear what form of regression was used .",
    "re - analysing the published lists of snrs with known distances implies that others ( e.g. ) have studies used regression minimising deviations in @xmath60 . ] , like cb98 , used regressions which minimise deviations on @xmath54 rather than @xmath53 .",
    "@xcite discussed the fitting of a @xmath0 relation to galactic snrs with known distances , and concluded from monte carlo simulations that ` orthogonal regression ' gives the best result .",
    "this conclusion is to be expected , given that in their monte carlo simulations @xcite assumes errors in @xmath53 and @xmath54 of same magnitude , which is not realistic .",
    "in practice , the errors in surface brightness  which depends on the uncertainties in flux density and angular size  are likely to be smaller than the errors in distances ( as @xcite say in their introduction ) .",
    "when the errors in @xmath53 and @xmath54 are different , then the orthogonal fitting does not produce the correct result . however , if the @xmath0 relation is to be used to derive distances to individual snrs , then a regression minimising deviations in @xmath53 should be used to obtain the best result .",
    "given the limitations of the @xmath0 relation and the selection effects that apply to the identification of snrs , rather than deriving the distribution of snrs in the galaxy directly  as done by cb98 ",
    "an alternative approach is to consider the @xmath2-distribution of sample snrs .",
    "this can be compared with the expected @xmath2-distribution from various models .    here",
    "i choose the sample of 69 ` bright ' snrs , above the nominal surface brightness limit of @xmath61 , where the current catalogue of galactic snrs is thought to be nearly complete .",
    "this method has the advantage of avoiding all of the uncertainties from the @xmath0 relation , but has the disadvantage of only using a fraction of the total number of catalogued galactic snrs .",
    "i include checks on how dependent the results are on a choice of surface brightness limit , or exclusion of regions close to @xmath44 .",
    "as noted above , a single surface brightness limit is not appropriate at all galactic latitudes , and some snrs above this nominal limit may well be missed in the brightest part of the galactic plane , i.e.  at latitudes near @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , the difficulty of identifying small angular size remnants is also more of an issue nearer @xmath44 .",
    "nevertheless , this sample is not as strongly affected by selection effects as the complete catalogue .",
    "-distribution of 69 bright snrs , and ( ii ) dashed line , from cb98.,width=321 ]    here i use a power law / exponential model for the galactic surface density of snrs with galactocentric radius , @xmath62 , with @xmath63 where @xmath64  kpc ( i.e.  a cylindrically symmetrical distribution about the galactic centre ) .",
    "given the limited number of snrs in the sample of ` bright ' remnants , no attempt is made here to constrain the form of the distribution perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "this model for the surface density of snrs tends to a zero density towards the galactic centre , which better matches the distributions derived for pulsars and star formation in the galaxy ( e.g.  ) than , for example , a simple gaussian distribution ( which i used in @xcite ) .",
    "this power law / exponential is one of the two models used by cb98 , who obtained best - fitting parameters of @xmath65 , @xmath66 .    [",

    "( the fitting was made with a model distribution of one million snrs , out to a galactocentric radius of 50  kpc , using bins of @xmath75 in @xmath2 . )",
    "the sum of squares misfit for the @xmath69 and @xmath70 bets fitting model is @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ f : sd - cb98 ] shows the power - law / exponential model derived by cb98 , which is a poor fit to the observed distribution of the 69 bright snrs , with a sum of squares misfit of 0.0841 .",
    "this clearly represents a broader distribution ( e.g.a flatter slope of the cumulative distribution near @xmath44 than what is observed for the ` bright ' remnants ) than that shown in fig .",
    "[ f : sd - best ] .",
    "this is not surprising given the systematic bias in the distances derived from the @xmath0 relation used by cb98 which was noted in section  [ s : sigma - d ] .",
    "the parameters for the best - fitting power - law / exponential model for the sample of 69 bright snrs , and that from cb98 are shown in table  [ t : fits ] .",
    "the broader cb98 distribution is also evident in fig .",
    "[ f : radial - best ] , which shows the surface density distribution of snrs with galactocentric radius for cb98 s model , and the best fit to the 69 bright remnants .",
    "for cb98 s best - fitting model , only 49  per  cent of snrs are inside the solar circle , compared with 73  per  cent for the best fit to the 69 bright remnants .",
    "the parameters of the best - fitting model are not well defined , as there is a strong degeneracy between the parameters , e.g.  it is possible to obtain almost as good fits with , @xmath77 , @xmath78 or @xmath79 ( i.e.  fixing one parameter to the value obtained by cb98 , and varying the other ) , which have sum of squares misfits of 0.0135 and 0.0128 respectively . the distribution with @xmath77 , @xmath80 peaks at a slightly larger radius from gc than the best - fitting distribution with @xmath81 and @xmath82 , but has a similar fraction of snrs , 76  per  cent , inside the solar circle .",
    "conversely the distribution with @xmath77 , @xmath80 peaks closer to the gc , but again has a similar fraction of snrs , 73  per  cent , inside the solar circle .    also , the best - fitting model depends on ( i ) the accuracy of the value of the surface brightness cut - off chosen to define the sample of ` bright ' snrs , and also ( ii ) the assumption that the remaining selection effects , which are more important close to @xmath32 are not important . to investigate these",
    "i have done the analysis with different @xmath83 cut - off values ( lower and higher by a factor of two ) , and excluding snrs within @xmath75 of @xmath32 .",
    "varying the surface brightness by a factor of two  the ` brighter ' and ` fainter ' samples in table  [ t : fits ]  does give rather different parameters , and hence different radial distribution , but the fraction of snrs within the solar circle does not change strongly .",
    "when the region @xmath84 is excluded ",
    "the ` omit near gc ' sample in table  [ t : fits ]  the best - fitting model is a pure exponential ( but note that this fitting does not depend on @xmath85  kpc ) .",
    "this suggests there are indeed residual selection effects near @xmath44 .",
    "nevertheless , the main result , that the distribution obtained by cb98 is too broad compared with bright snrs still holds .",
    "the conclusion is strengthened by the fact that any remaining incompleteness of the sample of 69 bright snrs will be concentrate towards @xmath44 .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the constraints presented here apply to the distribution of observed snrs .",
    "if the observability of snrs above the radio surface brightness limit depends on a property  e.g.ambient density  which varies with galactocentric radius , then this will mean the distribution of snrs is not the same as their parent sne .",
    "here i have discussed some of the properties of the most recent catalogue of galactic snrs , which contains 294 , particularly ( i ) the selection effects that apply to the completeness of the catalogue , and ( ii ) issues with using the ` @xmath0 ' relation to derive distances to individual remnants . by comparison of the distribution in galactic longitude of a sample of 69 ` bright",
