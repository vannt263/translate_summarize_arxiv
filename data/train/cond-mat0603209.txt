    "one of the primary goals in the field of molecular electronics is to understand quantum transport through individual nanoscale objects , such as molecules , short carbon nanotubes , or dna ; for reviews , see refs .",
    "an important difference to conventional mesoscopic transport through quantum dots or granular islands arises because molecules can have intrinsic vibrational degrees of freedom ( phonons ) that may give rise to franck - condon sidebands or phonon blockade in electronic transport .",
    "such features have been studied theoretically in many recent papers @xcite .",
    "molecular electronics is particularly exciting because it is in principle possible to contact molecules by leads of different nature .",
    "here we discuss how nonequilibrium transport is affected by a coherent phonon mode coupled to the molecular charge for the case of ( @xmath0-wave bcs ) _ superconducting leads_. molecules connected to superconductors promise a rich terrain of exploration that allows for new spectroscopic tools ( probing molecular properties ) , potentially useful applications , and interesting fundamental physics .",
    "first experimental results have appeared for carbon nanotubes @xcite and metallofullerenes @xcite .",
    "so far transport through molecules has been theoretically studied only for normal leads , either using rate equations or ( in the quantum - coherent regime ) perturbation theory in the electron - phonon coupling @xmath1 @xcite . for superconducting leads and large transmission through the molecule , subgap transport is ruled by mar processes @xcite .",
    "these have been extensively studied for point contacts @xcite and for junctions containing a resonant level @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we provide a theoretical framework to include vibrations into superconducting transport through a resonant molecular level .",
    "we focus on the most interesting quantum - coherent low temperature ( @xmath2 ) limit with high ( bare ) transmission , where coulomb charging effects are largely wiped out .",
    "therefore the coulomb interaction on the molecule will be neglected here .",
    "we compute the d.c .",
    "current basically for the full bias ( @xmath3 ) range within a keldysh green function scheme valid for small @xmath1 but arbitrary phonon frequency @xmath4 .",
    "this approximation is current - conserving for identical molecule - lead couplings @xmath5 and superconductor gaps @xmath6 .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "( i ) for @xmath7 , the coupling @xmath1 tends to _ enhance _ the excess current @xmath8 , which is defined as the difference in current for @xmath9 when changing normal into superconducting leads .",
    "( ii ) in the subgap regime @xmath10 , the phonon gives rise to a quite complicated structure in the @xmath11-@xmath3 characteristics around each mar onset at @xmath12 ( integer @xmath13 ) , with a pronounced _ even - odd parity _ dependence .",
    "these results can be qualitatively understood within a mar ladder picture . such a picture has previously been used for junctions with a resonant level @xcite and is here extended to include phonon - induced transitions ( inelastic mar ) .",
    "rich features in the @xmath11-@xmath3 curve appear already for @xmath14 , in contrast to normal leads where phonon signatures ( e.g.  sidebands ) emerge only at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "( iii ) for @xmath16 , we give analytical results for the josephson current in the adiabatic limit , @xmath17 .",
    "we find a reduction ( but no destruction ) of the critical current and a changed current - phase relation .",
    "these findings are in qualitative agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , where the opposite limit @xmath18 has been studied by lowest - order perturbation theory in the lead - molecule hopping .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we discuss the model and the keldysh green function approach taken in this work . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we present our results and provide a physical interpretation in terms of a mar ladder picture .",
    "how such a scattering - type approach can be connected to the keldysh approach is explained in detail in the appendix .",
    "finally , some conclusions are offered in sec .",
    "we put @xmath19 in intermediate steps .",
    "we now wish to formulate and analyze a tractable model describing the relevant physics of a molecule sandwiched between superconducting leads .",
    "writing the hamiltonian as @xmath20 we consider one relevant molecular level associated with the fermion operator @xmath21 for spin @xmath22 and located at the energy @xmath23 . in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) we take a linear coupling between the molecular charge and the phonon displacement @xmath24 , where the boson operator @xmath25 annihilates a phonon excitation . for a justification of this form and possible other couplings ,",
    "see ref .",
    "the leads are described by a pair of standard @xmath0-wave bcs hamiltonians . using the nambu vector @xmath26 for electrons in lead @xmath27 , we have @xmath28 with single - particle energy @xmath29 ; the @xmath30 matrix acts in nambu space . in the following , standard pauli matrices in nambu space",
    "are used and denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "using the nambu vector @xmath32 and @xmath33 for ( normal ) lead density of states @xmath34 , the lead - molecule coupling is @xmath35 where the voltage @xmath3 enters via the time - dependent phase .",
    "as we are mostly interested in the @xmath36 case , for simplicity , we consider @xmath37 to be real - valued .",
    "( in the study of the josephson current , the residual @xmath16 phase difference across the molecule is of course taken into account . )",
    "note that eqs .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) and ( [ h3 ] ) assume symmetric coupling and identical superconducting gaps .",
    "our approximation scheme below will yield a current - conservating result only then .",
    "in fact , since the calculation of mar - dominated transport is already involved for @xmath38 , a nontrivial current - conserving self - consistent approach covering the large transmission limit seems out of question . note",
    "that self - consistency is ( usually ) sufficient to ensure current conservation @xcite .",
    "below we instead proceed using a perturbation theory with the small expansion parameter @xmath39 .",
    "under such an approach , current conservation is known to only hold for the electron - hole symmetric case @xcite , i.e. , @xmath40 , with symmetrically arranged leads ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this case is taken in what follows .",
    "we note in passing that this important issue ( and also the tadpole diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) was overlooked in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the same approximation as ours was implemented for normal leads but also used for asymmetric cases .      to compute the current - voltage characteristics",
    ", we now employ the keldysh green function technique .",

    "( [ e1 ] ) . in",
    "what follows , we use the check notation ( @xmath51 ) in order to schematically indicate the keldysh structure . in the case of electron green functions ,",
    "this also includes the nambu structure . denoting the respective functions for @xmath38 by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and using the self - energy diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the dressed green functions used in our perturbative approximation follow from the dyson equation .",
    "as we consider only the case @xmath40 , it can be checked that the tadpole diagram does not contribute .    for the superconducting problem of interest here , it is convenient to use the double fourier representation @xmath54 and likewise for all other green functions and self energies .",

    "we also define the phonon contribution @xmath73 current conservation , @xmath74 , can be explicitly verified as follows . in the particle - hole symmetric case",
    ", current conservation requires that @xmath75 this relation is indeed obeyed since the approximate @xmath76 in eq .",

    "( [ dc_current ] ) , we evaluate the @xmath11-@xmath3 characteristics for @xmath77 ( unless noted otherwise ) and @xmath78 .",

    "( [ g0 ] ) and ( [ g1 ] ) are then done for each @xmath59 separately , involving matrix dimensions of the order @xmath82 .",
    "for very small @xmath83 , this becomes quite costly , and we limit ourselves to @xmath84 in the following .    fortunately , there are several nontrivial tests that we can use to check the scheme . for @xmath38 ,",

    "@xcite . for @xmath85 , we recover results of ref .",
    "@xcite when applicable ( i.e. , for @xmath40 ) . as additional check ,",
    "green function sum rules @xcite were verified , such as @xmath86 at coinciding times .",
    "while such relations must hold for the exact green function , it is reassuring to verify that our approximation does not lead to violations of sum rules .",
    "besides the current , we have also monitored the average phonon number @xmath87 and the frequency - dependent phonon distribution function .",
    "we find @xmath88 for @xmath89 , in accordance with our assumption of weak electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the phonon distribution function revealed renormalizations of the peak position away from @xmath4 by a few percent .    to conclude this section",
    ", we note that it is possible to establish a close connection between this keldysh green function approach and a landauer scattering approach incorporating inelastic transitions .",
    "such an inelastic mar picture will in fact be essential in interpreting our numerical results in sec .",
    "[ sec3a ] .",
    "this connection is detailed in the appendix .",
    "let us then turn to results for the @xmath11-@xmath3 curve .",
    "we start with the subgap regime , where mar provides the dominant transport mechanism . in particular , for @xmath90 ( @xmath13 integer ) , there is a total number @xmath13 of andreev reflections for electrons or holes within the superconducting gap . the @xmath11-@xmath3 curve for @xmath91 and @xmath92 is given in fig .  [ fig2 ] , where @xmath93 is always negative .",
    "note that in this fully transmitting limit , the @xmath11-@xmath3 curve for @xmath38 is smooth and does not exhibit the mar cusps encountered at lower transmission @xcite .",
    "phonons now _ restore _ such features near mar onsets , with pronounced _ even - odd parity effects _ : for even ( odd ) @xmath13 , @xmath93 shows valleys ( peaks ) around @xmath12 .",
    "this is clearly seen in the left inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath13 up to 12 @xcite .",
    "note that the dip at @xmath94 is somewhat shifted , presumably due to phonon renormalization effects .",
    "however , the appearance of even - odd parity oscillations is quite distinct and surprisingly regular given the complexity of this system .    in order to achieve a physical understanding of this even - odd effect ,",
    "it is useful to invoke a mar ladder picture in energy space , including inelastic transitions caused by phonon emission . a schematic description of the mar ladder picture in this limit is given in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "superconductor spectra are placed next to each other , but because of the presence of the bias , electrons emitted from left to right gain an energy @xmath95 in this process .",
    "holes that are reflected , traveling from right to left , also gain this energy .    usually the scattering approach is used to develop this picture @xcite , but its straightforward implementation encounters conceptual difficulties in the presence of inelastic phonon transitions .",
    "fortunately , a different route resolving these difficulties can be formulated via the above keldysh approach , whose formal justification is detailed in the appendix . here",
    "electron and hole propagators in energy space are coupled to each other through suitable andreev reflection matching conditions and the phonon self energy @xmath68 . for a qualitative explanation of the even - odd effect found in the full calculation ,",
    "[ fig2 ] , it is sufficient to restrict the full mar ladder picture to _ single _ phonon emission processes , where electrons ( holes ) lose ( gain ) the energy @xmath96 . since @xmath88 , emission dominates over absorption and multi - phonon processes are rare .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the two superconductors are positioned at the same chemical potential , but electrons ( from left to right ) and holes ( from right to left ) ` climb ' the mar ladder by gaining @xmath95 for each andreev reflection . the higher the total number of andreev reflections in one cycle , the larger the total charge transmitted . since we consider the high transmission limit where high - order mar processes are not penalized , the current is therefore expected to increase ( decrease ) if phonon emission is able to increase ( decrease ) the number of andreev reflections in a mar cycle . for @xmath95 slightly below @xmath97 with _ even _",
    "@xmath13 , we then argue as follows ; for @xmath98 , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for small energy transfer @xmath96 ,",
    "if a phonon is emitted during an electron segment , mar trajectories in energy space are not drastically modified in the sense that the number of andreev reflections stays unaffected .",
    "however , if a phonon transition occurs during a hole segment , the mar ladder is shifted upwards by @xmath99 and the last hole on the mar ladder can be scattered into the continuum ( left electrode in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) instead of being andreev reflected .",
    "consequently , one andreev reflection is lost and hence the current is expected to decrease .",
    "this argument applies both to incoming electrons and holes , and explains why current valleys are observed for @xmath100 with even @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . on the other hand , consider @xmath95 slightly above @xmath97 with _ odd _ @xmath13 . reiterating the above analysis , now phonon emission during a hole segment tends not to affect the number of andreev reflections . if the phonon is emitted during an electron segment , however , an additional andreev reflection has to take place to complete the mar cycle , leading to a current peak for @xmath100 with odd @xmath13 .",
    "next consider @xmath101 but otherwise identical parameters , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where @xmath93 can be positive and again shows oscillations near the mar onsets , which are less pronounced for small @xmath102 .",
    "remarkably , even for small voltages , @xmath103 , a rather complicated subgap structure is caused by the phonon . at such low voltages ,",
    "this is only possible via mar , for otherwise electrons or holes do not have enough energy to emit a phonon .",
    "the broad minimum corresponding to @xmath98 observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] has now vanished .",
    "let us invoke the mar ladder picture to rationalize this effect . for @xmath104 , by emitting a _ high - energy _",
    "phonon ( @xmath105 ) , the last electron on the mar ladder can now be scattered back inside the gap instead of heading to the continuum .",
    "this increases the number of reflections and thus the current . as a phonon emitted during the hole segment has the opposite effect ( see above ) , the net outcome of the higher phonon frequency is to suppress the valley at @xmath106 expected for small @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] also shows a dip in the current at @xmath107 , representing a phonon backscattering feature at @xmath108 .",
    "the scaling of this dip with @xmath4 was confirmed by additional calculations .",
    "one can also see a two - phonon feature at @xmath109 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "let us then briefly go back to @xmath110 ( cp .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , but now for @xmath111 , see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . for small @xmath112 ,",
    "quasi - resonances appear @xcite and cause additional features , e.g.  negative differential conductance portions in the @xmath11-@xmath3 curve .",
    "the mar ladder picture then has to include both quasi - resonances ( cp .",
    "@xcite ) and phonon transitions , which is possible but beyond the scope of this paper . fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows that the even - odd parity effect requires large @xmath112 to be observable .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the limits of very large and/or zero voltage . starting with the first case ( excess current ) , we have computed the difference @xmath113 between the excess currents @xmath8 with and without the phonon",
    ". this calculation has been done at @xmath114 , which according to the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite is certainly large enough for our parameters . for the case of high transmission",
    "encountered here , we find that phonons generally _ enhance _ the excess current . to give a concrete example , for @xmath115 , @xmath91 and @xmath116 , we find @xmath117 .",
    "a similar current enhancement at high transmission was also found for environmental coulomb blockade in superconducting junctions , and has been explained as antiblockade effect @xcite . as such , this effect of the phonon may not be too surprising .",
    "second , the equilibrium josephson current has been calculated by adopting our approach to the matsubara representation .",
    "for arbitrary parameters , it is straightforward to numerically compute the full current - phase relation .",
    "however , the current - phase relation in the adiabatic phonon regime defined by @xmath118 can even be calculated analytically , with the result @xmath119 where @xmath120^{1/2}\\ ] ] is an andreev bound state energy @xcite in the junction with an effective transparency @xmath121 the @xmath122-dependent shift without any broadening of the andreev level caused by the coupling to a phonon mode is characteristic for the coherent limit and decreases the critical current .",
    "very similar results were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite in the opposite limit @xmath18 .",
    "in this work , we have for the first time theoretically explored nonequilibrium molecular transport with superconducting leads in the coherent phonon regime .",
    "phonons reveal a rich subgap structure even for voltages well below the phonon frequency , including a surprising even - odd parity effect near the mar onsets .",
    "this effect can be largely understood within a physically appealing inelastic mar ladder picture , based on the assumption that single phonon emission processes dominate . for stronger electron - phonon couplings , also multiple phonon processes and/or",
    "absorption becomes important , and the practical usefulness of such a scattering approach is less clear , although it can be formally derived as outlined in the appendix .",
    "let us also offer a brief outlook .",
    "besides the obvious interest to experimentally probe the effects predicted here , the problems raised above deserve further theoretical work . in the case of strong electron - phonon coupling , different approximations",
    "will be necessary .",
    "moreover , other quantities such as shot noise or frequency - dependent noise @xcite deserve attention .",
    "noise can yield information about the effective charge involved in the transfer process , and how this charge is affected by phonon transitions remains to be explored .",
    "it would also be interesting to formalize the notion of inelastic mar spectroscopy , potentially allowing to infer the electronic structure of molecules from the superconducting current - voltage characteristics .",
    "such approaches have already been very useful in nanoscale break junctions , and are of obvious interest in the molecular electronics context as well .",
    "it is safe to conclude that superconducting molecular transport definitely warrants further surprises in the future .",
