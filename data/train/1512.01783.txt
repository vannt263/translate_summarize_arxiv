    "anyons are particle excitations obeying the _ braid statistics _ which interpolates continuously between fermion and boson statistics in two dimensions(2d ) .",
    "abelian braid statistics can be characterized by the phase factor @xmath0 of the many - body wave - function when two anyons are exchanged , with `` any '' @xmath1 , thus explaining their name .",
    "fermions(bosons ) correspond to @xmath2(1 ) . in real world anyons seem to appear in the fractional quantum hall systems@xcite , and presumably on the magnetized surface of topological insulators@xcite .",
    "their relation to high temperature superconductivity initiated decades ago@xcite , is still being actively pursued nowadays in a renewed form @xcite , requiring the knowledge of anyon thermodynamics , which however is barely known even for free anyons with @xmath3 .",
    "another interpolation between fermion and boson statistics was proposed by haldane .",
    "it is known as _",
    "haldane s exclusion statistics_(hes)@xcite or haldane - wu statistics(hws)@xcite , based upon the following state - counting ideas : for a many - body system in finite volume , the dimension @xmath4 of the hilbert space of the @xmath5-th particle depends on @xmath6 , which leads to the definition of statistical interaction @xmath7 via @xmath8@xcite .",
    "obviously @xmath9 for fermions , @xmath10 for bosons , and other intermediate values of @xmath7 define fractional he s . unlike the aforementioned braid statistics , the he s is not limited to planar systems and one can calculate their thermodynamic properties explicitly .",
    "the representative quantity is the energy distribution function @xmath11 which was derived by wu@xcite .",
    "it turns out that particles with hes(non - mutual ) have a well - defined fermi energy @xmath12 at zero temperature if @xmath13 . when @xmath14 , @xmath15 , otherwise @xmath16 , thus interpolating between fermi - dirac(fd ) distribution with @xmath9 and bose - einstein(be ) distribution with @xmath10 at zero temperature . at finite temperatures",
    "@xmath17 is much more complicated than fd and be distribution . in analogy with landau fermi liquid theory , a theory of interacting he s particles called haldane liquid was developed in ref . .",
    "an important result is the generalization of luttinger theorem : the interaction does not change the volume enclosed by the fermi surface for he s .    in one dimensional(1d ) systems a deep connection between luttinger liquids , braid statistics and he s",
    "was established in refs .",
    "@xcite , but for planar systems , braid statistics and he s are not always equivalent .",
    "in fact the free non - relativistic anyons do not show the evidence of he s . on the other hand , the non - relativistic anyon model in the strong magnetic field",
    "is exactly solvable after projection to the lowest landau level(lll)@xcite and it is described by an equation of state consistent with hes@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the filling factor of the lll at @xmath18 equals to @xmath19@xcite indicating @xmath20 .",
    "this is so far the only known exactly solvable model obeying he s in 2d and it has a flat dispersion .",
    "therefore , the clarification of the relation between he s and anyons braid statistics appears to be a step of great interest for providing a class of planar models obeying he s with non - trivial(non - flat ) dispersion .    in this article we show that the he s exists quite generically in 2d systems as long as there is a hall response . a general relation between @xmath7 and @xmath21",
    "is established _",
    "non - perturbatively _ by examining the total anyon number in the ground state .",
    "note that determining the energy distribution function @xmath11 requires a fock structure in terms of single anyon states , not found in anyonic systems where the @xmath6-body wave function is a multi - valued section depending non - trivially on the variables of all particles @xcite . on the other hand , the total anyon number is easy to calculate .",
    "in fact , according to the haldane s definition of the statistical interaction @xmath7 , one immediately obtains @xmath22 .",
    "if the entire band is filled , @xmath6 reaches its maximum denoted by @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "note that @xmath25 is also the maximum of fermion filling number @xmath26 , hence we find the integral form of haldane s statistical interaction @xmath27 which is consistent with haldane s energy distribution function @xmath11 , being more general , valid also for haldane liquids @xcite .",
    "the above description can be easily generalized to the case of multiple species with _",
    "mutual _ he s . labelling the species with a latin subindex @xmath28 , with obvious meaning of symbols , one finds @xmath29 , with @xmath30 defining the _ mutual _",
    "he s .    in the following we give two proofs of the relation between anyons",
    "braid statistics and he s , the first one involving an adiabatic argument given in sec .  [ sec : adiabatic - argument ] , while the second one given in sec .",
    "[ sec : rpa - calculation ] is based upon a specific model in a random phase approximation(rpa ) .",
    "[ sec : disc - concl ] is the conclusion .",
    "according to wilczek @xcite , one can map an anyon into a fermion bound to a flux tube by a singular gauge transformation , so that the multivalueness of the anyons wave - function , allowed by the non - trivial topology of the configuration space of 2d identical particles , is removed in the new fermion system . in this sense",
    ", anyons can be viewed as charged fermions with long range gauge interaction in which the braid statistics is encoded .",
    "the flux binding can be achieved in the lagrangian formalism by introducing the chern - simons(cs ) term .",
    "the resulting lagrangian in the minkowski space - time reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the current and @xmath33 is the statistical cs gauge field . by `` charge '' we mean the statistical charge coupled to @xmath33 s field , which is taken as unit here . at present",
    ", the precise form of the fermion lagrangian @xmath34 is not important , and it is only assumed to yield the hall conductance @xmath35 .",
    "we could take @xmath34 as describing the conventional quantum hall system , the magnetized surface state of a topological insulator , or other quantized anomalous hall insulators without magnetic field@xcite .    by integrating out the @xmath36 field ,",
    "one obtains the following constraint on the charge density and the statistical flux @xmath37 the chern - simons parameter @xmath21 characterizes the braid statistics , which measures the aharonov - bohm phase when one fermion circles around another or equivalently two fermions are interchanged .",
    "( a ) the chern - simons coupling parameter @xmath21 varies adiabatically with time inside the shadowed region @xmath38 , being zero outside .",
    "( b ) a hall insulator connected with a normal insulator.,width=264 ]    to illustrate the relation between the braid statistics and the he s , we isolate a thermodynamically large region @xmath38 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a from the rest .",
    "inside @xmath38 we turn on the statistical parameter @xmath21 adiabatically , generating the statistical flux @xmath39 through the region @xmath38 .",
    "this in turn induces a current @xmath40 with @xmath41 for a _ hall insulator _ in the scaling limit .",
    "then , according to the continuity equation and eq .",
    "we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total particle number in @xmath38 .",
    "eq .   implies that @xmath44 is time independent , therefore the particle number for a general value of @xmath21 is given by @xmath45 in the scaling limit . comparing with eq .",
    ", we obtain the condition @xmath46 between the statistical parameters @xmath7 for he s and @xmath21 for the braid statistics . as an example , let s revisit the non - relativistic anyons in a strong magnetic field . if we take only the llls into account , @xmath47 , one finds @xmath20 according to eq .  , which recovers the result given in refs ..    in this adiabatic argument",
    ", it is crucial for @xmath34 to describe a hall insulator , while a normal insulator with @xmath48 does not respond to the chern - simons flux in the required way .",
    "therefore , anyons in a normal insulator can not obey he s .",
    "this proof can be generalized to _",
    "statistics obeyed by multiple species of particles labelled by a latin subscript @xmath49 as after eq .  .",
    "let s consider anyons with statistical charges @xmath50 and hall conductivity @xmath51 coupled to a common chern - simon field as in eq .",
    ", then the mutual exchange statistics between species @xmath49 and @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 .",
    "the argument above generalizes eq .   to @xmath54 , thus relating also a mutual hes@xcite to anyons braid statistics .",
    "the details on the mutual statistics are given in the appendix .",
    "next , by invoking the edge states , inevitable in a quantum hall system with boundaries , we give another proof of eq .   admitting some generalization beyond the insulating case .",
    "in fact , even in eq .   a boundary term would be required to ensure gauge invariance ( see e.g. ref . ) , but it has not been written explicitly because it is irrelevant in the above adiabatic argument , based only on the continuity equations in the bulk .",
    "we just showed that the hall response is crucial for anyons obeying he s . in practice",
    ", a hall insulator can be realized with or without magnetic field . since anyons in a strong magnetic field",
    "have been studied before @xcite , in this article we consider the quantum anomalous hall(qah ) system without landau levels , which has been proposed theoretically@xcite and realized in recent experiments@xcite . to be specific we take the fermion lagrangian @xmath34 as a 2d massive dirac fermion with @xmath55 flavors , which can be written conveniently in the euclidean space - time as @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the fermion mass of flavor @xmath61 . in realistic systems , there might be impurities and conventional coulomb interactions between fermions , but for simplicity we ignore them here . in the following",
    "we present a perturbation calculation of the total anyon number in the ground state .",
    "the chemical potential in @xmath34 breaks the lorentz invariance down to the spatial rotation invariance .",
    "combined with the gauge invariance of eq .",
    ", one finds that the fermion polarization bubble @xmath62 takes the following form@xcite @xmath63 where we denote the space - time indices with greek symbols , while latin characters denote the spatial coordinates .",
    "the three @xmath64 s functions can be calculated straightforwardly .",
    "the first two terms are the conventional ones of the three - dimensional relativistic fermions with finite density .",
    "it is the antisymmetric @xmath65-term that is peculiar and the relevant one for 2d fractional exclusion statistics .    without chemical potential or for @xmath66 ,",
    "one finds @xmath67 @xcite , which provides the quantized hall conductance @xmath35 of the system . according to the nielsen - ninomiya theorem@xcite , the flavor number @xmath55 should be even except for some cases with topological reasons .",
    "if the signs of @xmath60 s annihilate in pairs , @xmath68 describes a normal insulator with @xmath48 .",
    "once these signs do not cancel completely , we obtain a hall insulator with integer hall conductance . as an example we note that the haldane s qah model@xcite has its low energy physics described by a @xmath69-flavor dirac fermion with the same mass term . for simplicity",
    ", we assume all masses @xmath60 have the same positive value @xmath70 , then @xmath71 . unlike other polarization",
    "terms(@xmath72 and @xmath73 ) , this induced chern - simons term is a topological effect which is independent of the specific characteristics of the model and non - perturbative in nature .",
    "indeed it depends only on the flavor number @xmath55 .",
    "we then adopt the random phase approximation by taking only this topological term into account and obtain the following propagator of the gauge field , @xmath74 where @xmath75 and the landau gauge is assumed for convenience .    to calculate the anyon number ,",
    "we first evaluate the free energy @xmath76 to the lowest perturbation order with all gauge boson lines being replaced by @xmath77 of eq .  , which includes the direct and exchange terms @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xmath80,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the inverse temperature and @xmath82 is the free fermion propagator of a single flavor .",
    "although it is almost the simplest approximation , it can reproduce the _ non - perturbative _",
    "results for the anyon insulator given earlier , since it already incorporates the important topological effect in the propagator @xmath77 .",
    "we first consider the insulating case with @xmath83 . to investigate the anyon number in the filled band(or vacuum ) , we require that the statistical charges of particles in the valence band are not screened at all , so that the vacuum expectation value of anyon density @xmath84 .",
    "however @xmath85 still vanishes if one calculates the fermion loop directly since a filled band usually can not carry any persistent current .",
    "note that the rpa propagator @xmath77 is antisymmetric and one might conclude @xmath86 at first glance .",
    "this is true for the normal insulators , but it is not correct for the hall insulator where a persistent chiral current does exist at the sample edges@xcite , as required by gauge invariance , though it vanishes in the bulk . since @xmath77 contains an infrared singularity , one can kill two birds with one stone by putting the system in a finite area @xmath87 in contact with normal insulator as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b . for the static state ,",
    "the current densities are time independent and , if the characteristic function of @xmath87 is denoted by @xmath88 , the chiral current density can be written as @xmath89 with @xmath90 the edge current . then the direct term can be written as @xmath91 which leads to the modification of anyon number @xmath92 in the presence of the chern - simons term , the chiral current also induces an electric field perpendicular to the boundary , which is proportional to @xmath93 and leads to an additional inner pressure .",
    "this is the origin of the second term in the r.h.s . of eq .  .",
    "indeed , @xmath94 is proportional to the compressibility @xmath95 for a fixed area . for the insulating state , where @xmath95 is zero ,",
    "we then recover the results given earlier and we can extend it to the more general case of incompressible , but not necessarily insulating systems .",
    "it is also noted that in this case , there is no contribution to the particle number from the exchange term @xmath79 and from other possible interactions , since they do not depend on @xmath96 as long as the bulk gap is not spoiled .",
    "we now consider a compressible anyon gas with @xmath97 , where the bulk excitation gap vanishes . in this case , we are only interested in the anyon gas in the conduction band , and assume the valence band is screened by a static background with opposite charges .",
    "the finite fermi sea modifies the polarization bubble eq .",
    "the hall conductance @xmath35 is no longer quantized and the compressibility @xmath98 is also nonzero accordingly . in this case not only the second term in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "but also the exchange term @xmath79 contributes .",
    "the calculation of @xmath79 follows the standard procedure for the qed with finite density given in refs .",
    "@xmath99 differentiating @xmath79 with respect to @xmath96 leads to the modification of particle number from the exchange term , @xmath100 with @xmath101 .",
    "the total particle number change is the sum of eq .",
    "and eq .  .",
    "finally , we consider a charge neutral situation in which all statistical charges in both valence and conduction bands are screened completely , so that all fermion loops vanish and only the exchange term survives . further assuming @xmath102",
    ", we obtain @xmath103 .",
    "if @xmath104 , we obtain @xmath20 , a result similar to the insulating case is obtained .",
    "the relation between he s and the exchange diagram has also been discussed in ref . where they set @xmath105 and did not consider the rpa .",
    "we have discussed the exclusion statistics of anyons in a generic quantum hall system . instead of analyzing the distribution of single particle states requiring fock structure , we study the total particle number in the many body ground state in a finite volume , which has been shown to characterize the crucial aspect of the statistics .",
    "our result proves that the total particle number of the ground state of anyons satisfies he s if the bulk excitations are fully gapped or more generally for an incompressible system .",
    "the crucial role played by edge currents for this result is clarified .",
    "anyons in normal insulators without hall conductance and edge states do not satisfy the he s .",
    "the compressible anyon gas does not show the he s as clean as the incompressible liquid .",
    "actually , it is noticed that the braiding statistics is not well defined at all in the 2d compressible superfluids@xcite .",
    "anyhow , for compressible systems if the parameter @xmath21 is well defined the relation between @xmath7 and @xmath21 is much more complicated than eq .  , involving also the system - dependent parameters like fermion mass .",
    "nonetheless at fixed chemical potential the particle number in finite volume strongly depends on the statistical parameter @xmath21 , and it even diverges at @xmath106(see e.g. eq .  ) as a bose liquid . since anyons can be viewed as fermions with gauge interaction , this indicates the violation of the original luttinger theorem for fermions@xcite by the chern - simons interaction with non - integer @xmath21 .",
    "our approach provides specific microscopic models satisying he s with non - trivial dispersion , it allows easily judging whether a system can obey he s or not , and points a direction for searching such an exotic statistics in real materials .",
    "we hope that our work may shed light on a large class of models in 2d , as the relation with he s did in 1d .",
    "in particular , it allows a cleaner treatment of the semionic ( @xmath107 holons in the 2d @xmath108 model , relevant to the cuprate high tc superconductors@xcite , in analogy with the semionic holons of the 1d @xmath108 model @xcite .",

    "in this appendix we give the details of the adiabatic argument for the mutual statistics .",
    "we first consider @xmath61 kinds of particles satisfying the mutual haldane s exclusion statistics(hes)@xcite characterized by the following equation @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the dimensionality of the new adding particle and the total particle number of kind-@xmath49 , respectively .",
