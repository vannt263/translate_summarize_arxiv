    "a plethora of new kind of states which have been observed recently has inspired extensive interest in revealing the underlying structure of these newly observed states .",
    "exploration of these states will improve our understanding of non - perturbative qcd . in recent years",
    "a significant experimental progress has been achieved regarding discoveries of bottomonium - like and charmonium - like charged manifestly exotic resonances @xmath11(10610 ) , @xmath11(10650 ) @xcite , @xmath12(3900 ) @xcite and @xmath12(4020/4025 ) @xcite.their production mechanism and decay rates are not compatible with a standard quarkonium interpretation .",
    "a huge effort in understanding the nature of these new states and in building a new spectroscopy is forthcoming .    in the recent years strong experimental evidence from b and charm factories",
    "has been accumulating for the existence of exotic new quarkonia states , narrow resonances called x , y , z particles which do not seem to have a simple @xmath13 structure .",
    "their masses and decay modes show that they contain a heavy quark - antiquark pair , but their quantum numbers are such that they must also contain a light quark - antiquark pair@xcite .",
    "the theoretical challenge has been to determine the nature of these resonances . their production mechanism , masses , decay widths , spin - parity assignments and decay modes",
    "have been revisited recently @xcite .",
    "the term exotica labels states which have an identical number of quarks and antiquarks but defy an ordinary meson classification .",
    "many exotic states in the charm sector with @xmath14 content have been discovered by belle and others @xcite .",
    "while there are most likely many more which are yet unknown and many of them should also reflect in the @xmath15 sector according to heavy quark symmetry .",
    "the non - discovery of the respective @xmath15 partners of the charmonium - like exotica would be even more enigmatic .",
    "belle collaboration has extended the study of the xyz exotic state family to the bottomonium sector by claiming the observations of two exotica states in @xmath16 decays @xcite .",
    "the cms experiment also searched for the bottomonium partner of @xmath17 at hadron colliders @xcite in the @xmath18 decay mode and found no evidence for the @xmath4 state while the ratio of the cross section @xmath4 to @xmath19 shows upper limit in the range of ( 0.9 - 5.4)@xmath20 at 95@xmath20 confidence level for @xmath4 masses between 10 - 11 gev .",
    "those are the first upper limits on the production of a possible @xmath4 state at a hadron collider .",
    "currently there are pending , unanswered questions concerning the exotic spectroscopy in the heavy quark sectors especially in the bottom sector . to promote the endeavor of understanding the heavy exotic states ,",
    "the exploration of the bottom sector is important .",
    "motivated by the babar s discovery of large @xmath21 signal discovered in the charmonium mass region , belle experiment have searched for similar state in the bottomonium sector@xcite .",
    "they observed partial decay widths @xmath22 ( n = 1 , 2 , 3 ) associated with the peak in the @xmath23 cross section hundreds of times larger than the theoretical predictions @xcite and the corresponding measured rates for the @xmath24@xcite .",
    "this observation suggests the presence of a new , non - conventional hadronic state in the bottom sector equivalent of the @xmath25 of the charm sector with mass around 10.890 gev @xcite which is referred as @xmath26 state .",
    "indeed , there exist three candidates up to date , namely the states labeled @xmath1(10890 ) , @xmath11(10610 ) and @xmath11(10650 ) , observed by belle [ 3 ] . not only new states are waiting to be discovered but also the existence of @xmath1(10890 ) needs to be established or refuted . the @xmath1(10890 )",
    "is a potential exotic state still remains to be confirmed since its observation first reported by the belle collaboration @xcite . looking into the interest in this case , present study is particularly focus on the negative parity @xmath9 exotic states .",
    "apart from its spin parity , study of its di - leptonic , hadronic and radiative decay widths also help us to solve the puzzling features of this state .",
    "the interpretation of the hidden bottom four quark state as a tetraquark exotic states has been advanced and has been studied in considerable detail @xcite .",
    "the experimental search for tetraquark states is a very difficult problem , since exotic candidates are nothing but the resonances immersed in the excited hadron spectra and moreover they usually decay to several hadrons .",
    "their mass and decay products put them in the category of quarkonia - like resonances but their masses do not fit into the conventional quark model spectrum of quark - antiquark mesons @xcite .",
    "however , to confirm a new resonance it is necessary to study all its properties with high level of accuracy including its mass and width . in this work",
    ", we develop phenomenology to study some of the theoretical problems of multiquarks and predict multiquark bound states and resonances . in particular , as a benchmark , we study in detail the heavy - light antilight - antiheavy systems who are expected to produce tetraquarks . despite the intense experimental attempts , these resonances are still mysterious and complicated and we still lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework . in particular , the most popular phenomenological models proposed to explain the internal structure of these particles are the compact tetraquark in the constituent diquark - antidiquark picture and the loosely bound di - meson molecular picture . following gell - mann@xmath27s suggestion of the possibility of diquark stucture @xcite , various authors have introduced effective degrees of freedom of diquarks in order to describe tetraquarks as composed of a constituent diquark and diantiquark using qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "this concept of diquark was even used to account for some experimental phenomena @xcite .",

    "@xcite also studied tetraquarks and pentaquarks systems by considering this concept of diquark . in their study",
    "they have included the spin spin interactions .",
    "on the other hand ebert et .",
    "@xcite employed the relativistic quark model based on the quasi - potential approach in order to find the mass spectra of hidden heavy tetraquark systems . unlike maiani et al . , they ignored the spin@xmath28spin interactions inside the diquark and anti - diquark .",
    "the presence of a coherent diquark structure within tetraquarks helps us to treat the problem of four - body to that of two two - body interactions . in the present case",

    "the existence of exotic hadrons of the diquarks - diantiquarks pair called tetraquarks or diquakonia is a problem which was foremost raised about 20 years ago and was used to describe scalar mesons below 1gev in 1977 by r. jaffe@xcite .",
    "he suggested the idea of strongly correlated two - quarks - two - antiquarks states to baryon - antibaryon channels where the mit bag model used to predict the quantum numbers and the masses of prominent states .",

    "the calculated partial electronic decay widths for p wave @xmath1 is about 0.03 - 0.12 kev which is in agreement with the available experiment data @xcite and other theoretical predictions @xcite .",

    "<S> we have done the exploratory study of bottom tetraquarks ( @xmath0;{q\\in u , d}$ ] ) in the diquark- + antidiquark framework with the inclusion of spin hyperfine , spin - orbit and tensor components of the one gluon exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> our focus here is on the @xmath1(10890 ) and other exotic states in the bottom sector . </S>",
    "<S> we have predicted some of the bottom counterparts to the charm tetraquark candidates . </S>",
    "<S> our present study shows that if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are diquark - diantiquark states then they have to be first radial excitations only and we have predicted @xmath3 state as first radial excitation of tetraquark state @xmath4 </S>",

    "<S> we have identified @xmath4 state with @xmath5 as being the analogue of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> an observation of the @xmath4 will provide a deeper insight into the exotic hadron spectroscopy and is helpful to unravel the nature of the states connected by the heavy quark symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we particularly focus on the lowest p wave @xmath7[\\bar b\\bar q]$ ] states with @xmath8 by computing their leptonic , hadronic and radiative decay widths to predict the status of still controversial @xmath1(10890 ) state . apart from this , </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown here the possibility of mixing of p wave states . in the case of mixing of @xmath9 state with different spin multiplicities </S>",
    "<S> , we found that predicted masses of the mixed p states differ from @xmath1(10890 ) state only by @xmath10 mev energy difference which can be helpful to resolve further the structure of @xmath1(10890 ) .    </S>",
