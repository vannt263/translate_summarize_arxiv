    "@xmath2 in the recent analysis of two dimensional(2d ) quantum gravity(qg ) , the conformal approach or the matrix model approach have been intensively done .",
    "those approaches are nonperturbative ones and it is expected that some non - perturbative features are important to understand the theory . at the same time , however , it is known that an orthodox perturbative approach , the semiclassical approach , is also useful in 2d qg@xcite .",
    "we present a close examination of the latter approach . a key point in this treatment",
    "is how to treat the area constraint and the topology constraint .",
    "the regularization of infrared divergence ( and ultraviolet divergence in the quantum evaluation ) is also important .",
    "the semiclassical treatments of 2d qg so far are insufficient in these points .",
    "we present a new formalism .    despite of the long period of research",
    ", the physical picture of the liouville theory , in relation to 2d qg , seems obscure .",
    "it shows the delicacy or the subtlety of the theory and requires some other proper formalism and regularization .",
    "as far as the popular formalism based on the conformal field theory is taken , the barrier @xmath3   does not seem to be overcome . whereas the computer simulations seem to no special difficulty for the prohibitted region of @xmath4@xcite .",
    "this conflict seems gradually serious . although the problem is examined from different approaches , it is fair to say the true situation is not known at present .",
    "recently it has been shown that the semiclassical results nicely explain the simulation data@xcite .",
    "it is well known , in the lattice qg , that a higher - derivative term , @xmath5 , regularize the theory very well .",
    "it has the effect of smoothing the surface ( if we take a proper coupling sign ) .",
    "the importance of the term is also stressed in the continuum context@xcite . from the simple power - counting we see",
    "the ultra - violet behaviour becomes well regularized .",
    "we can take two standpoints about the @xmath6-term:1 )  we are considering the 2d @xmath6-qg as one gravitational model;2 )  we regard @xmath6-term as a regularization to define the @xmath7  theory and expect its effect disappears when some limit is taken .",
    "although 1 ) is mainly taken in the present paper , both standpoints are important at this time of development .    in the semiclassical analysis of 2d @xmath6-qg in @xcite",
    "one of the classical solutions ( positive curvature solution ) is analysed . in the present paper",
    "we present the full structure of the classical vacua .",
    "it is quite interesting that the positive and negative solutions are symmetric with respect to a reflection in the coupling @xmath8-space .",
    "the explanation is self - contained .",
    "it is well known that the global quantities in the gravitational system , such as entropy , volume and temperature of the total universe , obey the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "it says those quantites can be regarded as thermodynamic state variables of an equilibrium state .",
    "we will find those properties in the present 2d model of qg .",
    "we can characterize all phases appearing in the theory by the @xmath8-dependence of the temperature .",
    "we present a general formalism in sec.2 , where some thermodynamic functions are introduced . in sec.3",
    "the classical solutions are obtained .",
    "they are @xmath6-gravity version of the liouville solution and describe positive and negative constant - curvature manifolds .",
    "the analytic expressions of some physical quantites are given and analysed .",
    "we characterize all asymptotic regions of the solutions in sec.4 . in sec.5",
    "an integral about a parameter @xmath9 , which appears in the general formalism in connection with the area costraint , is done .",
    "the analytic expressions of cross - over points in the theory are obtained in sec.6 .",
    "it shows the essetial behaviour of the theory is controled by a toatl derivative ( global ) term . in sec.7",
    "we characterize each phase and obtain the equation of state .",
    "the expressions for temperature and entropy are obtained .",

    "their topologies , however , are different :  the positive curvature solution satisfies  @xmath293  , which means the sphere topology , whereas the negative one satisfies :  @xmath294  ,  which means the toplogy of a sphere with the infinite number of punctures(fig.9 ) .",
    "we suppose this reflection symmetry of vacua is general for manifolds with other topologies .",
    "it means a physical quantity on a manifold can also be calculated on another manifold with a different topology .",

    "@xmath2 the important role of the integration parameter @xmath9   introduced in ( [ 3.4f ] ) and of the total derivative term discussed in sec.5 show the proper treatment of the area constraint and the topology constraint is so important to understand the 2d qg . in the treatment , the infrared regularizations of fig.2 and of fig.8 are nicely used .",
    "evaluation of the quantum effects to the present classical results is an important work to be done .",
    "it can be taken into account perturbatively as explained in ( [ 3.4j ] ) .",
    "the renormalization has already been analysed in @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 the present approach can be valid for the higher - dimensional quantum gravity .",
    "the 3 dim qg has been recently measured in the lattice simulation with a high statistics .",
    "the semiclassical analysis of the data will soon become an urgent work to be done .",
    "the success of the perturbative 2d qg using the semiclassical method is strongly encouraging for the further progress of the perturbative quantum gravity in the realistic dimensions .",
