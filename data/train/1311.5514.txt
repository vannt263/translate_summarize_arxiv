    "this volatile behavior is a consequence of direct wind accretion , in which the material couples to the magnetic field before a stable accretion disk can form which then would mediate the accretion flow .    the wind of the super - giant is highly structured , or clumpy , which is a result of line - driven instability and the influence of the neutron star ( see , among others , * ? ? ?",

    "cyclotron resonant scattering features ( crsfs , cyclotron lines for short ) are an important feature of the x - ray spectra of accreting neutron stars .",
    "they are produced in strong magnetic fields , where electrons are quantized onto landau - levels ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the energy of these levels is a strict function of the magnetic field strength .",
    "photons with energies close to the landau - levels are removed from the observed x - ray spectrum by scattering off these electrons .",
    "crsfs appear as broad absorption lines due to doppler broadening , and their energy is the only way to directly measure the magnetic field close to the surface of neutron stars .",
    "vela  x-1shows a prominent harmonic line at 55kev and a weaker fundamental line at 25kev @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field strength can be calculated using @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the energy of the fundamental ( @xmath15 ) or harmonic line ( @xmath16 ) line in kev .",
    "the detection of fundamental lines is complicated by the fact that in hard sources , with strong harmonic lines , its shape can be drastically altered to a point where the line is almost filled by spawned photons .",
    "photon - spawning occurs when an electron remains in an excited landau state after resonantly scattering , emitting another photon of similar energy when de - exciting .",
    "these photons can escape the line - forming plasma , especially when their energy is at the wings of the fundamental line .",
    "theoretical calculations by @xcite show that with increasing number of harmonic lines , the fundamental line gets shallower and can become undetectable in the observed x - ray spectrum .    the centroid line energy of the crsf is often found to vary with x - ray flux .",

    "@xcite performed a detailed study of the correlation between line energy and flux , confirming the behavior of her  x-1 and v  0332 + 53 on shorter time - scales .",
    "they also found conclusive evidence that the power - law photon - index is changing with flux , and that it shows the opposite behavior to the line energy , i.e. , that it decreases with flux in sources with a positive line - energy to flux correlation , and vice versa .",
    "both phenomena , the changing energy and the changing photon - index can be understood in terms of a change in altitude of the x - ray production region as function of flux , an idea put forward by @xcite and discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others . with changing altitude , the local magnetic field changes , explaining the change in energy .",
    "at the same time , the local plasma temperature changes , which can result in a change in the observed photon - index .",
    "depending on the overall luminosity , the correlation can switch from negative to positive , as described below , following the theory described in @xcite .    at typical luminosities of vela  x-1(@xmath18ergs@xmath1 ) , the matter is expected to be stopped very close to , or at , the stellar surface , so that the location of the line forming region is independent of the x - ray flux @xcite . at higher luminosities ,",
    "a shock dominated by coulomb interactions can form , stopping the matter above the stellar surface .",
    "the ram pressure of the in - falling material increases with higher accretion rate and pushes the shock region down into regions of higher magnetic field strength .",
    "this leads to a positive correlation of the line energy with flux and a hardening of the power - law component ( as suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "if the local eddington luminosity is exceeded , at the so - called critical luminosity , @xmath19ergs@xmath1 for typical neutron star parameters , a radiation - dominated shock forms .",
    "the shock height is then positively correlated with the accretion rate as higher x - ray luminosity leads to a higher radiation pressure .",
    "the results is an observed an anti - correlation of the crsf energy and correlation of the photon - index with flux .",
    "the line behavior has not been investigated for vela  x-1 , since no existing observations cover the necessary large range of luminosities with high spectral resolution . however , in a recent study using _ suzaku _ , @xcite found that the photon index @xmath20 is anti - correlated with the flux .",

    "a mass of @xmath165 provides the best description of the low luminosity data .",
    "of course , the neutron star mass is only one of many parameters influencing this correlation , but the data seem to prefer a more massive neutron star .",
    "@xcite , using _",
    "suzaku_data taken in 2008 , have shown that the photon index @xmath20 is anti - correlated with luminosity .",
    "this agrees well with the fact that the photon - index typically shows the opposite behavior as function of flux as the cyclotron line energy @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : ge2flx ] , our data show the same behavior , albeit with a much shallower slope .",
    "however , @xcite used the ` npex ` continuum , which makes a direct comparison difficult . the hardening of the spectrum with x - ray flux can be understood as a direct consequence of the coulomb shock moving further down into the accretion column where the electron gas becomes hotter .",
    "photons can be scattered up to higher energies via the inverse compton effect , and a harder spectrum is observed @xcite .",
    "the pulse - to - pulse results indicate that at the highest luminosities the relation flattens out , which is very similar to what we observed for the cyclotron line energies .    with the reduced accretion radius ,",

    "55 of @xcite , we find that @xmath143 is even below @xmath142 , i.e. , vela  x-1would be in the super - critical accretion regime . in this regime ,",
    "an anti - correlation between the line energy and the luminosity would be expected , contrary to the behavior observed of the harmonic line .",
    "however , @xmath143 has been calculated under the assumption that it can be scaled to the size of the accretion column compared to the surface of the neutron star . in the extreme case of a very narrow accretion column ,",
    "this assumption might not hold , for example , radiation could escape through the walls of the accretion column before interacting with the in - falling material .",
    "further calculations are needed to investigate this question .",
    "our model of sub - critical accretion with a narrow accretion column provides a good explanation of the measured behavior of the harmonic line .",
    "the fundamental line , however , shows a very different behavior as a function of luminosity .",
    "in fact , there seems to be an anti - correlation visible up to 7@xmath167ergs@xmath1 , at which point the correlation seems to flatten , i.e. , it shows an opposite behavior as the harmonic line .",
    "it is difficult to conceive a physical reason for this discrepancy .",
    "influence of the 10kev feature on the line energy is unlikely , as the behavior is also seen in observation ii , in which the 10kev feature was not fitted in the ks - integrated spectra .",
    "we analyzed the spectrum of the off - state during observation ii .",
    "we described it with an absorbed power - law , without the need for a exponential cut - off .",
    "while the photon - index of the power - law is higher in that state , the disappearance of the cut - off makes the continuum overall harder .",
    "we could not significantly detect a cyclotron line .",
    "@xcite analyzed a similar off - state in _ suzaku_data and argue that the accretion can not be switched off completely because the spectrum is hard and residual pulsations remain visible .",
    "the luminosity was @xmath168ergs@xmath1 in the _ nustar_off - state data , i.e. , about an order of magnitude lower than the lowest point shown in figure  [ fig : ge2flx ] .",
    "at that very low luminosity , it is unlikely that a shock is stopping the accretion flow , so the in - falling materials is only stopped at the surface of the neutron star . here",
    ", the comptonizing electron gas is hotter and denser , possibly moving the cut - off and the energy of the harmonic crsf above 60kev .",
    "this would be consistent with our findings of a single power - law component .      the _ nustar_data allow both cyclotron lines to be simultaneously measured and their evolution to be studied on time - scales as short as 1000s .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : crsfcorr]_a _ , the depth of the fundamental and the harmonic line are anti - correlated , with a pearson s correlation coefficient of @xmath169 .",
    "spearman s rank correlation gives @xmath170 with a false alarm probability of @xmath171 , indicating a highly significant anti - correlation .",
    "taking both @xmath172- and @xmath173-errors into account and using the routine described by @xcite to fit a linear correlation , we obtain a best - fit slope of @xmath174 .",
    "as soon as the strength of the harmonic line @xmath175 reaches @xmath2125kev ( optical depth @xmath176 ) , the fundamental line drops below the noise limitations of the data .",
    "this anti - correlation is likely a result of photon - spawning .",
    "photon - spawning occurs when an electron at an excited landau - level falls back to a lower state , emitting one or more photons close to the energy of the fundamental line energy @xcite . with an increasing depth of the harmonic line ,",
    "more electrons are in excited levels , resulting in a higher number of spawned photons , which can fill up the fundamental line .",
    "photon - spawning is a direct consequence from resonant scattering and explains the observed anti - correlation of the line depths .",
    "the strong variability of the fundamental line depth can explain apparently contradictory results in the literature , concerning the presence of the line ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite did not find evidence for the fundamental line in _ bepposax_data .",
    "but these authors measured an equivalent width of the harmonic of @xmath177kev , much higher than our values ( equivalent width of @xmath28814kev ) .",
    "this prominent line could provide enough photons to fill up the fundamental line such that it is undetected . on the other hand ,",
    "the optical depth @xmath178 of the line in _ rxte_data shown by @xcite is between 0.51 , depending on pulse phase , close to our values of around @xmath1790.9 . in these data",
    "the fundamental line is clearly detected .",
    "we conclude that the fundamental crsf is at 25kev , in agreement with @xcite but has avoided detection in some data due to photon - spawning from a prominent harmonic line .",
    "the ratio of the energies of the cyclotron lines is shown in figure  [ fig : crsfcorr]_b_. to first order , we would expect the line energies to be correlated , with a factor of two between the energy of the fundamental line and the harmonic line @xcite .",
    "the dotted line illustrates this expected correlation .",
    "our data clearly deviate from that correlation .",
    "when ignoring the data in which the fundamental line was not detected , pearson s correlation coefficient is @xmath180 and spearman s @xmath181 , with a false alarm probability of 0.23 .",
    "the best fit slope of a linear fit is @xmath182 .",
    "this implies an anti - correlation with a little over @xmath183 confidence .",
    "confidence contours for the time - averaged spectra show that there is no model intrinsic degeneracy present between the line energies .",
    "the deviation from the canonical ratio of 2.0 is directly connected to the different behavior as function of x - ray luminosity , as shown in figure  [ fig : ge2flx ] .",
    "spawned photons from the harmonic lines are likely to influence the shape of the fundamental line , and could probably shift the measured centroid energy from its real value .",
    "the data do not provide enough resolution to investigate the shape of the fundamental line in detail .",
    "this theory can therefore only be tested by extensive theoretical calculations , which can provide insight how the line energy ratio can deviate so strongly from 2.0 .     and the depth of the fundamental line @xmath123 .",

    "b ) _ correlation between the line energies of the harmonic crsf and the fundamental line .",
    "the red dashed line shows a linear fit to the data points , the blue dotted line indicates a factor of 2.0 between the line energies . ]      the environment around the neutron star is dominated by the heavily structured stellar wind from the optical companion .",
    "this clumpy wind is responsible for the complex absorber , which we model as partial covering , with two independent absorption columns .",
    "additionally a photo - ionization wake is present , which moves into our line - of - sight after orbital phase 0.5 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in increased absorption at late orbital phases ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "we observe average column densities around @xmath184@xmath11 , which fit very well into that picture .    during observation",
    "i , @xmath12increases to a very high value of @xmath185@xmath11 ( see figure  [ fig : p2pres_all]_c _ ) .",
    "the column density then changes smoothly over about 10ks , decreasing again to values seen at the beginning of the observation .",
    "assuming this event was caused by a clump moving through our line - of - sight we can calculate its size . at the orbit of the neutron star ( @xmath186 ) , the wind has a speed of about @xmath187kms@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "at the orbital phase of the event , @xmath188 , the wind speed is almost perpendicular to the line - of - sight , so that if the clump moves with the same velocity , it stretches out for about @xmath189 cm .",
    "this is about an order of magnitude larger than the clumps calculated from x - ray flares by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that the wind speed might be drastically reduced due to the influence of the neutron star and its strong ionizing x - ray radiation @xcite .",
    "however , only very close to the neutron star does the wind velocity become low enough that a clump of the size of previous works ( @xmath190 cm ) would stay in the line - of - sight for 10ks .",
    "following @xcite , assuming a spherical clump with @xmath189 cm and an over - density of 100 compared to the smooth wind ( @xmath191g@xmath192 ) . the correct one would be kg@xmath192 . ] , results in an absorption column of @xmath193@xmath11 .",
    "this is about a factor of 10 smaller than observed . from these estimates , it becomes clear that even an unusually large clump can not explain the observations by simply moving through the line - of - sight with the wind speed .",
    "there is some degeneracy between @xmath12and cf in the model .",
    "area drops below 3.0kev so this degeneracy can not be fully disentangled and the measured @xmath12values should be taken with some caution .",
    "the measured variations of @xmath12and cf are , however , larger than the model degeneracy would allow , so that the increased absorption is very likely a real event .",
    "it is possible that the event is caused not by one clump , but by a larger number of them , moving in such a way that they start to overlap during the phase of increased absorption . according to stellar wind theories",
    ", the vast majority of the wind is located in clumps , so that many of them are close to our line - of - sight at any given moment ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when the clumps start to overlap , the absorption column increases and at the same time the covering fraction can decrease , as observed .",
    "the assumption of spherical clumps , however , is not necessarily correct .",
    "simulations by @xcite , for example , show that line - driven stellar winds show complex shocked structures and not simple spherical clumps .",
    "elongated clumps aligning with the line - of - sight could explain the observed behavior without the need of very large size .",
    "detailed simulations would , however , be necessary to quantify this scenario .",
    "using two different _ nustar_observations , we performed spectral analysis with high temporal and spectral resolution .",
    "the average spectrum can be well described with a standard absorbed ` fdcut ` model .",

    "we have shown that the absorption , continuum and cyclotron line parameters are all highly variable .",
    "we showed that the strength of the fundamental line is anti - correlated with the strength of the harmonic line .",
