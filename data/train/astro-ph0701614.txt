    "as the nearest region of star formation that includes young massive stars , the orion nebula and its eponymous cluster attract considerable attention from students of star formation .",
    "the cluster is displaced towards the observer from the remainder of the host molecular star and the visible nebula is a relatively thin , irregular , concave layer of ionized gas on the observer s side of the molecular cloud .",
    "numerous optical shocks and jets @xcite reveal the presence of collimated and broad outflows from those stars that lie in the photoionized portion of this region ; but one must rely on infrared , x - ray , and radio observations to tell what is happening among the optically obscured cluster stars lying beyond the h  ii region , which constitute roughly half of the total cluster membership @xcite . in the case of the highly embedded ( about 0.2 pc behind the nebula ) bn - kl region , one only sees a few optical features resulting from stellar outflow at the tips of the allen and burton fingers ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the region known as orion - south ( orion - s , also known as orion molecular cloud  1 south or omc-1s ) , lying 1  to the southwest from the dominant ionizing star @xmath0ori  c , the embedded sources lie near the surface of the nebula and we see numerous herbig - haro ( hh ) objects there .",
    "this is the third region of star formation in the vicinity of the orion nebula and is in a local bump in the surface of the nebula @xcite , where the expanding h  ii region has been slowed because of the higher density of gas there .",
    "there have been numerous recent papers that try to relate the moving optical features to the obscured sources of the outflows , but we reassess the situation here because of the recent availability @xcite of high spatial resolution maps of co and sio outflows from orion - s .",
    "we present new results obtained spectroscopically and with imaging in   2 , summarize what we know about the optical features in   3 ,",
    "present a combined picture of the optical features in   4 , and discuss their relation to the co and sio outflows in   5 . throughout this paper",
    "we will adopt a distance of 460 pc , after @xcite , henceforth bom .",
    "in this section we present new observations of the orion nebula .",
    "the first results are from a program of mapping the radial velocity across the huygens region of the nebula , the second are results from imaging an even wider region with the hubble space telescope .      ] , [ @xmath1 , and [ @xmath1 is shown in red , green , and blue , respectively .",
    "each panel shows emission in a 12  @xmath2 wide channel centered on the heliocentric velocity indicated in the lower - left corners .",
    "the intensity scalings vary between the different channels and different lines .",
    "position offsets are measured with respect to @xmath0ori  c. ]    we have constructed isovelocity channel maps of the core of the orion nebula , based on echelle longslit observations in the optical emission lines of [ @xmath16716,6731 , [ @xmath36300 , and [ @xmath16312 .",
    "full details of the observations and data reduction process are given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth gh07 ) .",
    "the data were obtained primarily with the manchester echelle spectrometer @xcite on the 2.1  m telescope of the observatorio astronmico nacional at san pedro martir , b.c . , mexico , while part of the [ @xmath1 dataset was obtained with the 4  m telescope at kitt peak national observatory ( * ? ? ? * henceforth doh04 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : isomaps ] shows images of selected channel maps , with [ @xmath36300 shown in red , [ @xmath16731 shown in green , and [ @xmath16312 shown in blue . all velocities in this section are given in the heliocentric frame , and can be transformed to the local standard of rest by subtracting 18.1  @xmath2 .",
    "all positions in this section are given in arcseconds , ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) , with respect to @xmath0ori  c , the brightest of the trapezium stars and the principal source of ionizing photons in the nebula .",
    "some artifacts are present in the data , principally due to variations in sky brightness , which manifest themselves as vertical stripes in the images .",
    "these are most noticeable where the signal is intrinsically weak , such as in the blueshifted [ @xmath3 emission ( shown as red in fig .",
    "[ fig : isomaps]_a _ ) and are further discussed in .    the difference in the emission distribution between the three lines is due primarily to changes in ionization : the [ @xmath1 line is emitted only by fully ionized gas , whereas the [ @xmath3 line comes from a thin layer of partially ionized gas at the ionization front or from shocks in neutral gas .",
    "the [ @xmath1 line comes from both the ionization front ( if ) and from the fully ionized gas that is close to it .",
    "in addition , collisional deexcitation causes the [ @xmath1 line to saturate in the highest density regions .",
    "since the electron density shows a general decline with distance from the center of the nebula , the outer parts of the map have a green tinge , indicative of relatively strong [ @xmath1 emission , while the inner parts vary from pink to blue , depending on whether low- or high - ionization emission is dominant .",
    "the emission in the most blueshifted channel that we show , centered on @xmath6 , is dominated by a broad band of high - ionization gas known as the big arc @xcite , which crosses the south of the nebula from east to west .",
    "one also sees emission from the low - velocity wings of the highly blue - shifted hh objects @xcite : hh  203/204 around ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) ; hh  202 around ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) ; and the low - ionization hh  201 at ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) . as one passes to more redshifted channels ,",
    "these features fade away to be replaced by the systemic nebular emission , which in low - ionization lines is dominated by linear bar - like features @xcite , of which the bright bar ( in the lower - left of the images ) is merely the most prominent example ( see for a more detailed discussion ) . in this paper",
    "we discuss only the data around hh  528 out of the rich body of information of this data - set because this is the lowest ionization object among the many hh objects in the orion nebula .",
    "hh  528 is a long , collimated outflow along a position angle @xmath13 , which originates around 30 south of the trapezium as a broad jet and ends in a diffuse bowshock where it interacts with the bright bar .    the hh  528 jet can be best seen in our channel map centered on @xmath14 ( figure  [ fig : isomaps ] ) as an elongated ( @xmath15 ) pink - orange region , centered on ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) .",
    "it can also be seen at more blueshifted velocities , where it is superimposed on the higher ionization big arc south , and more redshifted velocities , where it is seen to be cut in two by a dark extinction feature .    in [ @xmath3 ,",
    "the jet appears to have two components : a spatially broad , smooth component , which is also seen in [ @xmath1 , plus a series of compact knots along its eastern side at ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , and ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) .",
    "these knots are more blueshifted than the smooth component , being most visible in the @xmath24 channel . further south",
    ", we can identify two more knots of blueshifted emission in both [ @xmath1 and [ @xmath3 at ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) and ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) , which show the highest contrast against the surrounding nebula in the @xmath29 channel .",
    "no [ @xmath1 emission is seen from the jet .    ]",
    "line ( black symbols with error bars ) , together with adjacent nebular background profiles ( gray symbols ) .",
    "the continuous line shows a gaussian fit to the jet profile .",
    "the error bars in the jet profile are a combination of the observational noise with the uncertainty in the estimated nebular background at the jet position ( see text ) . ]",
    "the visibility of the jet in a given channel is strongly affected by the brightness and velocity of the surrounding nebular emission and so is not a reliable guide to the jet s radial velocity .",
    "therefore , we have extracted one dimensional [ @xmath3 spectra from 5-long samples of the slit , which cover the jet and two adjoining background regions . we have fitted a gaussian profile to the background - subtracted jet profile , assuming that the nebular emission in the jet sample can be linearly interpolated from the two background samples ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : jetfit ] ) .",
    "although the peak velocity and shape of the background nebular line is relatively stable in the vicinity of the jet , its brightness shows substantial variation along the slit , and this is the primary contribution to the uncertainty in the jet profile on its redward side ( we have used a conservative estimate of one half of the difference between the two background samples ) .",

    "the top panel shows electron densities calculated from the doublet ratio , while the bottom panel shows the intensity of the longer component . ]",
    "the terminal bowshock of hh  528 is also visible as a blue - shifted feature in our maps , showing the greatest contrast in the same channels as for the jet .",
    "although it is strongest in the low - ionization lines , it is also present in [ @xmath1 .",
    "the brightest part of the bowshock is a diffuse clump , of roughly 10 in diameter , centered on ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) .",
    "it is displaced about 10 towards the trapezium from where one would expect to find the bright bar , assuming that the northeastern portion continued in a straight line to the southwest",
    ". there is also blueshifted emission , strongest in [ @xmath3 , extending about 40 southwest along the bar , which seems to be a wing of the bowshock .",
    "weaker blueshifted emission also extends a similar distance to the east and north east , which may represent the opposite wing of the bowshock .",
    "figure  [ fig : hh528bow ] shows profiles of the [ @xmath16731 line from two positions in the bowshock and for an adjoining undisturbed region of the bright bar at ( @xmath36 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "the bulk of the bowshock emission is blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity , peaking at @xmath37 to @xmath38 , as opposed to @xmath39 for the undisturbed bar . note that it is impossible to reliably subtract the background nebular emission from the bowshock profile , as was done for the jet profile above .",
    "this is because the nebular emission shows extreme brightness fluctuations that preclude the possibility of interpolating its value from adjacent regions .",
    "in particular , the emission from the bright bar is significantly depressed at the position of the bowshock , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : hh528bow ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the bowshock component is so strong that its velocity can be reliably estimated even without background subtraction .",
    "in addition to the blueshifted peak , the bowshock profiles also show weak red wings , extending out to @xmath40 , which are lacking in the bar profile .",
    "the weak low density component around @xmath41 is present in all the profiles and is an unrelated general feature of this part of the nebula .",
    "the surface brightness of the bowshock emission is very similar to that of the rest of the bar , as is the electron density ( upper panel of figure  [ fig : hh528bow ] ) at 2500 to 3000  @xmath42 .",
    "the bowshock also shows the same ionization stratification as the bar , with the emission from more highly ionized lines becoming progressively more diffuse and shifted towards the direction of the trapezium . on the other hand ,",
    "the [ @xmath3 emission is not as thin as in the bar proper .",
    "roughly 15 to the south of the bowshock lies a curious zone of low - ionization , low - brightness , scalloped emission features which are most visible in the velocity range @xmath43 to @xmath44  @xmath2 .",
    "electron density channel maps show a narrow ridge of enhanced density that is continuous between these features and the eastern portion of the bright bar .",
    "the new hubble space telescope ( hst ) images used in this study were obtained as part of program go 10246 , with massimo robberto serving as the principal investigator .",
    "this program imaged the huygens region of the orion nebula and its periphery using 104 pointings .",
    "the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) was the primary instrument and the pointings were chosen so as to provide a continuous mosaic across the nebula .",
    "parallel observations were made with the wide field and planetary camera ( wfpc2 ) , and the nicmos infrared instrument , although those data are not used in the current study .",
    "the primary scientific thrust of program go 10246 is to study the properties of the orion nebula cluster stars and this drove the selection of the filters employed ; however , a complete mosaic was made with the f658n filter ( characteristic exposure time 340 s ) , which is equally sensitive to both hydrogen h@xmath45 ( 6563  ) and [ n  ii ] ( 6583  ) emission .",
    "the other filters employed and their characteristic exposure times were f435w ( 420 s ) , f555w ( 385 s ) , f775w ( 385 s ) , and f850lp ( 385 s ) .",
    "the observations were made in two observing campaigns , in october , 2004 and april , 2005 .",
    "the wealth of images were combined and rendered into a seamless mosaic .",

    "there are two regions of large scale outflows in the orion nebula : one centered about 55  to the southwest from the brightest trapezium star ( @xmath0ori  c ) and the other centered on the bn - kl sources to the northwest .",
    "the two regions are clearly independent of one another and in this paper we ll address only the outflows associated with the southwest orion - s region . as we shall see , it is likely that there are multiple sources in this region . in this section",
    "we will summarize the characteristics of the optical outflows that appear to be associated with orion - s and in the next section investigate whether there are common sources for them .    for each object we will identify the discovery paper ( when possible , sometimes there were multiple steps in recognition of the nature of the object ) ,",

    "figure  [ fig:3d ] shows the central region of the nebula in three dimensions . for simplicity ,",
    "we have assumed in calculating the position along the vertical axis that the objects all originate from the center of the oos .",
    "this assumption is certainly not valid for all the hh objects , but affects only little the general picture of what is going on . in each case",
    "the direction of the velocity vector is that derived from @xmath47  and @xmath49 .",
    "it should be recalled that the inner region of the orion nebula has been mapped in three dimensions by @xcite , who determined that the surface is concave ( as viewed by the observer ) , with @xmath0ori  c  lying about 0.2  pc ( 90 ) in front of the ionization front and there is a local rise of about 0.05  pc ( 22 ) at orion - s .",
    "the last feature indicates that orion - s is a denser region within the host orion molecular cloud and that the ionization front has not penetrated as far there .",
    "the first striking thing about figure  [ fig:3d ] is that all of the optical objects are blueshifted .",
    "this indicates that the sources for these hh objects lie in the background of the visible nebula or even in the optically obscured region beyond the if .",
    "one would expect the optical extinction to increase significantly as one begins to penetrate the photon dominated region ( pdr ) because the density jumps there . if a source were close to the if , its redshifted component would quickly disappear , unless the flow was diverted into being blueshifted .",
    "the fact that several flows seem to be paired ( e.g. , hh 529 and hh 269 , hh 203/204 and hh 202 ) has led multiple authors to posit that these are bipolar flows from a single source , with the originally redshifted component being altered into having a blueshift without a significant change in the orientation on the plane of the sky ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this argument is especially attractive for the hh 529-hh 269 pairing because one sees the components moving in opposite directions in the plane of the sky , leaving a gap only in the oos region .",
    "a process for deflection of a redshifted component has been proposed and modeled by @xcite .",
    "they establish theoretically that a jet passing through a density gradient will be deflected towards the direction of the lower density .",
    "this is extremely attractive for explaining what we see in the orion nebula because we know that there is a strong density gradient away from the if , being lower towards the observer @xcite and theoretical models indicate that the density in the neutral pdr should rise as one passes the if . whether or not a beam is deflected by or penetrates the pdr will be dependent upon many factors , including geometry , magnitude of the density gradient , mass flux of the jet , so that one can not make an accurate prediction of what will occur .",
    "this means that redshifted flow from a source located within the ionized zone of the nebula will eventually reach the if .",
    "if it is deflected sufficiently it can become a blueshifted flow and if it passes through or remains in the pdr then it will be optically invisible .",
    "if the source is obscured by extinction ( embedded ) , then the conversion of a redshifted into a blueshifted component means that the source must lie close enough behind the pdr so that there is still an increase of density away from the observer .",
    "there is some evidence that this is the case for the flow from the oos source since calculated that the source was only a few hundredths of a parsec beyond the if .",
    "unfortunately , the @xcite mechanism can also make it more difficult to identify the location of a source .",
    "this is because if a jet strikes a region with a tilted density gradient not only will there be the potential of changing a redshift into a blueshift , but , the direction in the plane of the sky can be changed .",
    "however , one expects that this alteration will be less important since the concavity of the if is not great except in the region of the bright bar .",
    "this mechanism may be what produces the curvature of the path of the components of hh  625 , which argue is a flow grazing along just behind the if .    there is another mechanism that complicates identification of a source of an outflow by extrapolating back in the plane of the sky and that is deviations in the direction of the flow caused by a wind blowing on the jet .",
    "this mechanism has been invoked by @xcite to explain the bent small - scale bipolar jets that one sees in the orion nebula , the object associated with ll orionis being the best example ( bom ) .",
    "the side wind is most likely to be the flow of gas away from the bright central region of the nebula .",
    "it may be that the well defined curvature necessary to connect hh 203+hh 204 to hh 400 and its southernmost components is caused by such a wind .",

    "the opposite directions of the tangential velocities of the innermost parts of hh 269 and hh 529 indicates that if they share a common origin that this lies in the region identified as the oos . the fact that projections of the directions of the high velocity jets leading to hh 202 and hh 203 pass through the oos led to speculate that it is a center of their outflows too .",
    "since the symmetry axis of hh 528 also crosses the oos , it too could originate there .",
    "however , in this paper we have shown that it can be argued , albeit not definitively , that hh 203 , hh 204 , and/or hh 528 could be a result of the deflection of the originally redshifted sio outflow from 136356 .",
    "this means that we will limit the discussion here to hh 202 , hh 269 , and hh 529 . in figure",
    "[ fig : bob5 ] we see the structure of the jet feeding hh 202 .",
    "its location demonstrates that the source is not the star 138340 postulated by @xcite from their fabry - perot velocity maps of this region .",
    "moreover , their figure 2 shows that the hh 202 jet passes slightly east of 138340 , which is clearer in the hei velocity picture shown in our figure  [ fig : bob5 ] and in s figure  16 .",
    "@xcite also argue on the basis of the opposing alignment that hh  202 and hh  528 are part of the same outflow , with hh  528 being the originally redshifted component .",
    "similar opposing alignments with a large intervening gap seem to be an insufficient argument for establishing such a connection .",
    "while a deflection off the pdr will largely cause a shifting of the velocity along the line of sight , it is also expected to produce some change in direction in the plane of the sky .",
    "we note that the southern part of hh  202 s high velocity jet curves clockwise at its southern end , indicating that it may not originate within the oos .",
    "however , since jets can curve more than once , the possibility remains open .",
    "@xcite argued that the elongation of the 1.3 cm source 143353 ( which falls within the oos ) towards hh  202 means that this is the source of hh  202 s jet .",
    "however , for this to be the case , the jet would have had to be bent several times to be displaced and reoriented at the point where we begin to optically see it .",
    "the alignment of the direction of the tangential velocities of the westward moving objects ascribed by to hh  269 argues that they are part of the same flow .",
    "since the more easterly group lies immediately west of the oos and east of the center of the sio outflow , they both can not arise from the sio outflow .",
    "the more westerly hh  269 features are positions that are compatible with a deflected sio outflow .",
    "if that is the case , then the hh  269 components lying even further to the west ( beyond the region covered in ) could also have the same source .",
    "this interpretation means dis - associating the two groups studied by and arguing that the alignment of tangential velocities and positions is only fortuitous .",
    "this may be the case , as the east and west groups have quite different tangential velocities ( @xmath144 and @xmath145 respectively .",
    "definitive proof of one interpretation or the other is lacking , but would be provided if one could determine detect optical objects moving from the direction of the sio source and curing into the direction of the western components of hh  269 .",
    "@xcite also argue that the projection of the high velocity features associated with the western part of hh 529 intercepts the infrared source 144351 and that it is the source of the outflow driving hh  529 .",
    "this otherwise attractive argument is diminished by the high spatial resolution hst tangential velocity study which indicates that the common motion of the features associated with the high velocity flow project about 2  south of 144351 .",
    "this means that what is happening in the oos region and its possible relationship to the major hh objects in the orion nebula remains very much uncertain at this time .",
    "the absence of strong radio , infrared , x - ray , or optical sources within the oos remains a mystery , if one or more outflows originates from there .",

    "<S> multiple optical outflows are known to exist in the vicinity of the active star formation region called orion - south ( orion - s ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have mapped the velocity of low ionization features in the brightest part of the orion nebula , including orion - s , and imaged the entire nebula with the hubble space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> these new data , combined with recent high resolution radio maps of outflows from the orion - s region , allow us to trace the origin of the optical outflows . it is confirmed that hh  625 arises from the blueshifted lobe of the co outflow from 136359 in orion - s while it is likely that hh  507 arises from the blueshifted lobe of the sio outflow from the nearby source 135356 . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that redshifted lobes are deflected within the photon dominated region behind the optical nebula . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a possible identification of a new large shock to the southwest from orion - s as being driven by the redshifted co outflow arising from 137408 . </S>",
    "<S> the distant object hh  400 is seen to have two even further components and these all are probably linked to either hh  203 , hh  204 , or hh  528 . </S>",
    "<S> distant shocks on the west side of the nebula may be related to hh  269 . </S>",
    "<S> the sources of multiple bright blueshifted herbig - haro objects ( hh  202 , hh  203 , hh  204 , hh  269 , hh  528 ) remain unidentified , in spite of earlier claimed identifications </S>",
    "<S> . some of this lack of identification may arise from the fact that deflection in radial velocity can also produce a change in direction in the plane of the sky . </S>",
    "<S> the best way to resolve this open question is through improved tangential velocities of low ionization features arising where the outflows first break out into the ionized nebula .    </S>"
