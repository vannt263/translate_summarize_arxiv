    "both the scaling properties and the broad cluster size distributions found , as well as the existence of a scaling function @xmath66 , are main signatures of cluster - cluster aggregation and dynamic scaling theory @xcite .    in many cases the cluster - cluster aggregation mechanism leads to formation of complex , fractal - like objects @xcite . however , in the present case the structure of the aggregates are simpler with a compact internal organization . in relatively strong magnetic fields ,",

    "the cluster diffusion coefficients do not depend on the direction in which the clusters move , i.e. , hydrodynamic corrections are not important as they are in case of constant magnetic fields @xcite .    in the basic cluster - cluster aggregation model",
    "@xcite it is assumed that the diffusion coefficient is @xmath87 and the corresponding scaling exponent is @xmath16 .",
    "we have determined two distinct values for the diffusion coefficients @xmath10 and scaling exponents @xmath0 as a result of the two clearly different types of behaviour observed in our experiments .",

    "these scaling exponents agree well with exponents @xmath0 determined directly from the time dependence of @xmath55 , @xmath65 and @xmath91@xmath92 respectively .",
    "unfortunately , at present we are not able to explain why similar experiments on approximately the same samples ( concentrations , layer thickness etc . ) show scaling exponents with values that come in two clearly separated ranges and diffusion exponents @xmath10 which are different from the expected value @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the scaling exponent @xmath0 is either clearly lower or higher than the theoretically predicted value @xmath16 .    in an earlier study of a similar system of magnetic holes in a constant magnetic fields",
    "@xcite it was found that for small microspheres ( diameters @xmath93 m and interaction strength @xmath94 ) the scaling exponents @xmath0 and @xmath1 were approximately equal @xmath95and typically slightly lower than 0.5 : 0.38@xmath96 . however , for larger particles , @xmath97 m ( @xmath98 ) the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 increased with the value of the dimensionless interaction strength @xmath99 from about 0.1 to 0.6 , and correspondingly the value of @xmath5 decreased from above @xmath100 to @xmath101 .",
    "thus , depending on the particle size the scaling exponents changed from being nearly constant and near the theoretically expected values to being strongly non - universal .",
    "although the present particles are within the diameter and @xmath99 ranges which showed nearly universal behaviour in ref .",
    "@xcite , the magnetic interactions are very different ( anisotropic in the former and isotropic in the present ) and then the range of @xmath99 for which the behaviour in non - universal , seems to be changed .",
    "it is unclear why the diffusion conditions , as quantified by the values of the diffusion coefficients @xmath10 , were so different in the two typical cases reported here",
    ". it may possibly be related to fine details in the interaction between the microspheres and the glass plates confining the system . in principle",
    "the magnetic holes should be repelled from the confining walls @xcite but if for some unknown reason a small fraction of the particles become attracted or even loosely attached to the walls , this would slow down the diffusion as shown by the anomalous value @xmath102 in one of the analyzed cases . extremely small values of @xmath8 could indicate that some of the particles are trapped in the sample volume or on the sample glass boundary .",
    "diffusion limited cluster - cluster aggregation of magnetic holes has been induced by a rotating magnetic field .",
    "the main features of the experimental results are well described by a diffusion limited cluster - cluster aggregation model and dynamic scaling theory .",
    "the experimental conditions were designed in effort to have a well defined model of a low concentrated many body system where long range interactions are dominant . at present , the reason why two main aggregation regimes were observed is not clear . this resulted in scaling exponent values clearly different from those predicted by theory for systems with short range interactions .",
    "this difference in behaviour was further confirmed by unusual values of the scaling exponent @xmath10 of the diffusion coefficient that were found by cluster tracking .",
    "an open question remains : why do the isotropic , long - range particle - particle interactions suppress the diffusion regime where the size - dependence of the diffusion coefficient scales with @xmath87 ? this will hopefully be clarified in future studies .",
