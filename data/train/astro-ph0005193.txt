    "since the discovery of the optical counterpart of grb 970228 ( van paradijs et al .",
    "@xcite ) the accurate localizations provided by the _ beppo  sax _ satellite have led to the detection of the optical afterglow for more than ten gamma ",
    "ray bursts ( hereafter grbs ) .",
    "the most spectacular result of these observations is to have provided a direct proof of the cosmological origin of grbs .",
    "the detection of absorption lines at @xmath0 in the spectrum of grb 970508 ( metzger et al .",
    "@xcite ) followed by other redshift determinations ( between @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) confirmed the indications which were already available from the _ batse _ data showing a grb distribution perfectly isotropic but non homogeneous in distance ( fishman and meegan @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the energy release of grbs with known redshifts extends from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "the solid angle @xmath5 in which the emission is beamed is quite uncertain .",
    "a small @xmath5 should reveal itself by a break after a few days in the afterglow light curve .",
    "a break is indeed observed in a few cases such as grb 990510 ( harrison et al .",
    "@xcite ) where @xmath6 could be as small as 0.01 . however , most afterglows do not show any break which means that @xmath5 is usually not very small ( @xmath7 ? ) .",
    "+ the source of cosmic grbs must therefore be able to release a huge energy in a very short time .",
    "possible candidates include the coalescence of two neutron stars ( eichler et al .",
    "@xcite ; paczyski @xcite ) , the disruption of the neutron star in a neutron star  black hole binary ( narayan et al .",
    "@xcite ; mochkovitch et al .",
    "@xcite ) or the collapse of a massive star ( woosley @xcite , paczyski @xcite ) . in all these cases",
    "the resulting configuration is expected to be a stellar mass black hole surrounded by a thick disc . since the power emitted by grbs is orders of magnitude larger than the eddington limit it can not be radiated by a static photosphere .",
    "the released energy generates a fireball which then leads to the formation of a wind .",
    "moreover , this wind has to become highly relativistic in order to avoid the compactness problem and produce gamma",
    " rays ( baring @xcite ; sari & piran @xcite ) .",
    "values of the lorentz factor as high as @xmath8@xmath9 are required , which limits the allowed amount of baryonic pollution to a remarkably low level .",
    "only a few mechanisms have been proposed to produce a wind under such severe constraints : ( _ i _ ) magnetically driven outflow originating from the disc or powered by the blandford ",
    "znajek ( @xcite ) process ( thomson @xcite ; mszros & rees @xcite ; daigne & mochkovitch @xcite ; lee et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; ( _ ii _ ) reconnection of magnetic field lines in the disc corona ( narayan et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; ( _ iii _ ) neutrino  antineutrino annihilation in a funnel along the rotation axis of the system ( mszros & rees @xcite ; mochkovitch et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "mechanisms ( _ i _ ) and ( _ ii _ ) require that the magnetic field in the disc reaches very high values @xmath10 . our preliminary study ( daigne & mochkovitch @xcite ) of the wind emitted from the disc shows that it can avoid baryonic pollution only if some very severe constraints on the dissipation in the disc and the field geometry are satisfied . some recent works ( ruffert et al .",
    "@xcite ) have also shown that mechanism ( _ iii _ ) is probably not efficient enough to power a gamma  ray burst , except may be for the shortest events .",
    "when the wind has reached its terminal lorentz factor , the energy is mainly stored in kinetic form and has to be converted back into gamma  rays .",
    "two main ideas have been proposed to realize this conversion .",
    "the first one is the so - called external shock model ( rees & mszros @xcite ; mszros & rees @xcite ) .",
    "the wind is decelerated by the external medium , leading to a shock .",
    "gamma  rays are emitted by the accelerated electrons in the shocked material through the synchrotron and/or inverse compton mechanisms .",
    "this model has been studied in details ( fenimore et al .",
    "@xcite ; panaitescu et al .",
    "@xcite ; panaitescu & mszros @xcite ) and seems unable to reproduce some important features of grbs such as their strong temporal variability ( see however dermer & mitman @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , the external shock model reproduces very well the delayed emission at lower energy from the afterglows ( mszros & rees @xcite ; wijers et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the second proposal is the internal shock model ( rees & mszros @xcite ) where the wind is supposed to be formed initially with a very inhomogeneous distribution of the lorentz factor .",
    "rapid parts of the wind then catch up with slower ones leading to internal shocks where gamma ",
    "rays are again produced by synchrotron or inverse compton radiation .",
    "we have started a study of this model in a previous paper ( daigne & mochkovitch @xcite , hereafter dm98 ) where the wind was simply made of a collection of `` solid '' shells interacting by direct collisions only ( all pressure waves were suppressed ) .",
    "the very encouraging results we obtained had to be confirmed by a more detailed study .",
    "we have therefore developed a relativistic hydrocode to follow the evolution of the wind .",
    "we present the code and the main results in this paper .",
    "we write in sect .",
    "2 the lagrangian equations of hydrodynamics in special relativity . in sect .",
    "3 we describe the numerical method we use to solve them and we present the tests we performed to validate the method .",
    "we display our results in sect . 4 and sect .",
    "5 is the conclusion .",
    "we write in a fixed frame the equations of mass , momentum and energy conservation in spherical symmetry : @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the spatial and temporal coordinates in the fixed frame .",
    "the following quantities appear in eqs .",
    "[ eqvm][eqem ] : @xmath16 is the pressure in the fluid local rest frame , @xmath17 is the fluid velocity in the fixed frame and @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the specific volume , momentum density and energy density ( including mass energy ) in the fixed frame .",
    "these three quantities are related to quantities in the fluid local rest frame : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the lorentz factor , @xmath25 is the rest - mass density and @xmath26 is the specific enthalpy density ( @xmath27 being the specific internal energy density ) .",
    "the lagrangian mass coordinate @xmath28 is defined by @xmath29 @xmath30 being the radius of the back edge of the wind .",
    "the system of eqs [ eqvm][eqem ] is completed by the equation of state @xmath31 the adiabatic index @xmath32 being a constant .    in the non - relativistic limit ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) , the quantities @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 become equal to their newtonian counterparts @xmath35 , @xmath17 and @xmath36 and eqs .",
    "[ eqvm][eqem ] then reduce to the classical equations of lagrangian hydrodynamics in spherical symmetry .",
    "the great similarity between the relativistic and classical equations will allow us to use the powerful numerical methods which have been developed in classical hydrodynamics to follow the evolution of a fluid with shocks .",
    "an extension of the piecewise parabolic method of colella and woodward ( @xcite ) to 1d eulerian relativistic hydrodynamics in planar symmetry has been already presented by mart and mller ( @xcite ) .",
    "we follow exactly the same procedure to extend the ppm to the lagrangian case in spherical symmetry .",
    "we adopt @xmath37 as the set of variables .",
    "if the mass - averaged values @xmath38 of @xmath39 at time @xmath40 in each cell @xmath41 $ ] extending from @xmath42 to @xmath43 are known , the values @xmath44 at time @xmath45 are computed in four steps :     + the variables @xmath46 are obtained from @xmath39 in each cell by solving the following equation in @xmath47 : @xmath48 once @xmath47 is known , the other quantities are easily computed since @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "these mass - averaged values are then interpolated by polynomials in the way described in the original paper by colella and woodward ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use the same modifications of the coefficients of the interpolation polynomials , leading to a steeper representation of discontinuities and a monotone representation of smoother parts .",
    "+ at each interface @xmath51 , two effective states @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 and @xmath14 denote the left and right sides of the interface ) are constructed by mass - averaging these quantities in the region of cells @xmath55 and @xmath56 connected to the interface @xmath51 by a characteristic line during the time step .",
    "+ at each interface @xmath51 , the two effectives states @xmath52 and @xmath53 define a riemann problem ( two constant states separated by a discontinuity surface ) , which is known to give rise , like in newtonian hydrodynamics , to two new states @xmath57 and @xmath58 separated by a contact discontinuity and related to the initial states @xmath52 and @xmath53 either by a shock or a rarefaction wave .",
    "the common values of the pressure and the velocity of the two new intermediate states are given by the implicit equation @xmath59 an analytic expression ( for a polytropic gas ) of @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 either refers to the @xmath54 or @xmath14 state ) has been worked out by mart and mller ( @xcite ) .",
    "equation ( 11 ) is solved using brent s method to obtain the pressure @xmath62 and the velocity @xmath63 of the intermediate states at each interface .",
    "+ the quantities @xmath64 are calculated with numerical fluxes at each interface obtained from @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the same way than colella and woodward ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have sucessfully checked our code against two usual tests in relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "the first one is the shock tube problem which is simply a riemann problem in which the initial states are at rest .",
    "we present in fig.[figtest1 ] the results for @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "the adiabatic index is @xmath71 and the discontinuity is initially located at @xmath72 .",
    "the figure is plotted at a time @xmath73 for a grid of 1000 zones initially equally spaced .",
    "the agreement between the exact and numerical profiles is satisfactory .",
    "the positions of the contact discontinuity and the shock are very accurate",
    ". the density , pressure and velocity of the post - shock state are also exact .",
    "however , the value of the density in the immediate vicinity of the contact discontinuity shows a small non - physical increase , which is more pronounced when the shock is stronger and disappears when the shock is weak ( as in the shock tube problem with @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath68 , @xmath76 , which has been considered by several authors ) . in the context of the internal shock model for grbs , the shocks are only mildly relativistic and",
    "we do not observe any unexpected increase of the density in the results presented below .",
    "this test consists in a cold fluid , which is initially homogeneous ( @xmath77 ) and enters a sphere of radius 1 at constant velocity @xmath78 .",
    "the fluid bounces at @xmath79 and is heated up .",
    "we present in fig.[figtest2 ] the results for @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 at @xmath83 .",
    "the adiabatic index is @xmath84 and we used a grid of 1000 zones initially equally spaced . in the considered case of a cold homogeneous fluid , an analytical solution is known .",
    "the shocked state is at rest with a density @xmath85 and a pressure @xmath86 . at time",
    "@xmath15 the unshocked cold fluid of velocity @xmath78 has a distribution of density @xmath87 .",
    "the numerical profiles appear accurate except in the vicinity of the origin .",
    "the shock propagates with the correct velocity and the post - shock values of density and pressure are well reproduced .",
    "we therefore conclude that the treatment of the geometrical terms in eqs [ eqvm][eqem ] is correct .",
    "we have not tried to improve the computation near the center , which is not of major importance in the context of the internal shock model for grbs where most of the emission takes place far from the origin .",
    "we have used our code to follow the evolution of a relativistic wind with a very inhomogeneous initial distribution of the lorentz factor .",
    "the first results have been already presented for small values of the lorentz factor @xmath88 ( daigne & mochkovitch @xcite ) . here",
    "we describe our results for the large lorentz factors ( @xmath89 ) which are relevant for the study of grbs .",
    "we first consider the case of a simple single - pulse burst .",
    "whatever the initial event leading to a grb may be ( ns  ns or ns  bh merger , `` hypernova '' , etc ) , the system at the end of this preliminary stage is probably made of a stellar mass black hole surrounded by a thick disc ( the `` debris '' torus ) .",
    "we consider that @xmath90 , a substantial fraction of the available energy of the system , is injected at a typical radius @xmath91 into a wind emitted during a duration @xmath92 with a mass flow @xmath93 .",
    "we do not discuss here the physical processes controlling @xmath93 , @xmath92 and @xmath90 but we assume that the baryonic load @xmath94 is very small .",
    "the wind converts its internal energy into kinetic energy during its free expansion in the vacuum ( the effect of the interstellar medium is negligible at this early stage ) and accelerates until it reaches a lorentz factor @xmath95 at a typical radius @xmath96 ( mszros et al .",
    "this is where our simulation starts .",
    "more precisely , we define our initial state as follows .",
    "we consider that from @xmath97 to @xmath98 , a wind with a distribution of the lorentz factor defined by @xmath99 has been produced by the source and that its back edge has reached @xmath100 km ( we adopt @xmath101 ) .",
    "we suppose that energy is injected at a constant rate @xmath102 ( we adopt @xmath103 in the following ) , so that the total energy injected into the wind simply equals @xmath104 and the injected mass flux is @xmath105 .",
    "the density profile in this initial state can be calculated if we assume that the internal energy is very small compared to the kinetic energy , which is indeed the case when the wind has reached its terminal lorentz factor ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the eulerian and lagrangian profiles of @xmath107 in the wind at @xmath98 are shown in fig.[figinitial ] for @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "we have adopted @xmath110 and have checked that the results do not depend on this small value .",
    "the fast part of the wind catches up with the slower one .",
    "the matter is strongly compressed is the collision region , the velocity gradient becomes very steep and at @xmath111 , two shocks appear : a forward shock reaching the front edge at @xmath112 and a reverse shock reaching the back edge at @xmath113 .",
    "the hot and dense matter behind these two internal shocks radiates and produces the observed burst .",
    "the radiation losses are not taken into account in the dynamics , which is probably not a too severe approximation since the dissipated energy represents about 10% of the total kinetic energy of the wind .",
    "when the two shocks have reached the edges , the evolution becomes unimportant regarding the emission of gamma - rays : two rarefaction waves develop at each edge and the wind continues to expand and cool .",
    "in fact , at this stage , the interstellar medium should absolutely be included in the calculation .",
    "an external shock propagates into the ism which produces the afterglow and a reverse shock crosses the wind which can also lead to an observable emission .",
    "all these effects are not included in the present simulation , which is stopped when the two internal shocks have reached the wind edges .",
    "we present in fig.[figdynamique ] ( left panel ) the paths in a @xmath15  @xmath114 plot ( @xmath115 is the arrival time of photons emitted at time @xmath116 on the line of sight at a distance @xmath14 from the source ) of the two shocks and of the two edges of the wind . in the right panel the corresponding distributions of @xmath107 and @xmath25 are plotted at different times .",

    "this shock will produce a contribution to the grb which will be observed at an arrival time @xmath123 and which will last @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the lorentz factor of the emitting material for which we adopt @xmath126 .",
    "the luminosity of the shock is estimated by @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the mass flux across the shock and @xmath129 is the dissipated energy per unit mass in the frame of the shocked material .",
    "our code detects all the internal shocks present in the wind at a given time and saves their parameters in order to sum all the contributions to the emission and produce a synthetic gamma - ray burst . in a recent paper ( dm98 )",
    "we presented a simple model where the wind was idealized by a collection of `` solid '' shells interacting by direct collision only ( i.e. all pressure waves were neglected ) .",

    "we observe an overall similarity between the two calculations , despite the crude approximations of the simple model .",
    "not surprisingly , the worst estimated quantities are the post - shock density and the dissipated energy per proton , which are underestimated by a factor of @xmath145 .",
    "conversely , the emission time and the lorentz factor of the emitting material are correctly reproduced .",
    "the emission starts earlier in the simple model where there is no preliminary phase of compression before the formation of shocks ( this leads to a larger underestimate of the density at the very beginning of the simulation ) , and ends later .",

    "the other quantities @xmath148 , @xmath140 and @xmath149 are not directly given by the hydrodynamical simulation but are parametrized by @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , whose values are unknown .",
    "to make a useful comparison between the two series of results , we take the same @xmath150 and @xmath136 in the two cases but adjust @xmath152 so that the typical synchrotron energy is the same .",

    "this is corrected by our choice of parameters for @xmath140 and the resulting synchrotron energies are very similar in the two cases . also notice that the efficiency of the synchrotron process is smaller in the simple model due to a poor estimate of the mass flux accross the shock .",
    "the agreement between the two calculations is satisfactory and allows to be quite confident in the results of the simple model .",
    "compared to the hydrodynamical code , the simple model has very short computing times and enables a detailed exploration of the temporal and spectral properties of synthetic bursts which was presented in our previous paper ( dm98 ) .",
    "we show in the next section the detailed results obtained with the hydrocode in the case of a single pulse burst .",
    "the contributions of the forward and the reverse shocks are added to construct the synthetic burst .",

    "an important property of the internal shock model is its ability to produce a great variety of temporal profiles .",

    "( @xcite ) have shown that complex bursts can generally be analysed in terms of a series of ( possibly overlapping ) simple pulses .",
    "this result is readily interpreted in the context of the internal shock model .",
    "a wind made of a succession of fast and slow shells will produce a succession of pulses which will add to form a complex burst .",

    "each pattern made of a slow and a rapid part produces its own individual pulse and the resulting burst has a complex shape with five , very similar , pulses .",
    "our second example ( fig .",

    "the resulting burst is more realistic with four pulses of different intensities .",
    "we did not treat with the hydrocode a large number of cases as we did with the simple model .",
    "nevertheless we confirmed the essential result that the variability introduced in the initial distribution of the lorentz factor is present in the burst profile with the same time scale .",
    "the profile therefore appears as a direct indicator of the activity of the central engine .",
    "this paper is the continuation of our study of the internal shock model started in dm98 .",
    "we developed a 1d lagrangian relativistic hydrocode ( in spherical symmetry ) to validate our previous simpler approach where all pressure waves were neglected in the wind .",
    "our code is an extension of the classical _ ppm _ method of colella and woodwards ( @xcite ) in the spirit of the work by mart & mller ( @xcite ) for the eulerian case in planar symmetry .",
    "a detailed comparison has been made between the hydrocode and the simple model in the case of a single pulse burst .",
    "it appears that the dynamical evolution of the wind is well reproduced by the simple model , which is not too surprising because the wind energy is largely dominated by the kinetic part so that the effect of pressure waves is small .",
    "only one physical quantity  the density of the shocked material  is strongly underestimated in the simple model . in order to make valuable comparisons between the two calculations",
    "we have therefore adjusted the equipartition parameters so that the mean value of the synchrotron energy is the same in the two cases",
    ". the synthetic bursts which are then obtained are very similar which proves that our first approach was essentially correct and confirm our previous results .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by panaitescu and mszros ( @xcite ) who performed a comparable study .",
    "the internal shock model can easily explain the great temporal variability observed in grbs .",
    "the main characteristic features of individual pulses are well reproduced : ( 1 ) pulses have typical asymmetric `` fred '' profiles ; ( 2 ) the pulse width decreases with energy following a power ",
    "law @xmath200 with @xmath201 ; ( 3 ) short pulses show a tendency to become more symmetric .",
    "our model still gives very short pulses which decay faster than they rise but the hydrodynamical simulation improves the situation compared to the simple model .",
    "spectral properties of grbs are also well reproduced .",
    "we obtain synthetic spectra which can be nicely fitted with band s function with parameters comparable to those observed in real grbs . the spectral hardness and the count rate are correlated during the evolution of a burst with the hardness usually preceeding the count rate . as also pointed in dm98 , the duration ",
    "hardness relation is a natural consequence of the internal shock model .",
    "these results are very encouraging and the main difficulty which remains is the low efficiency ( about @xmath202 ) of the internal shock model . as long as the energetics of grbs and the mechanism initially operating in the central engine are not precisely identified , we can not say if this is a critical problem or not .",
    "we still believe that the internal shock model is at present the most convicing candidate to explain the gamma  ray emission from grbs .",
    "next steps in this work will address the following questions .",
    "we first want to extend our hydrodynamical code to a non ",
    "adiabatic version in order to include the radiative losses in the dynamical calculation .",
    "we have already developed an `` isothermal rieman solver '' for that purpose ( daigne & mochkovitch @xcite ) .",
    "we would also like to study the effects of the external medium , with a special attention to the reverse shock which propagates into the wind and possibly interacts with the internal shocks .",
    "preliminary results with the simple method using `` solid layers '' have already been obtained ( daigne & mochkovitch @xcite ) but they have to be confirmed by a hydrodynamical calculation . finally , we would like to investigate the details of the emission process during internal shocks to solve some of the problems encountered by the synchrotron model .",
