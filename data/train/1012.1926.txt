    "to date over 490 extrasolar planets have been discovered , revealing a wide diversity of planetary systems ( http://exoplanet.eu ) .",
    "one of more unusual phenomena so revealed has been the population of `` hot jupiters ''  gas - giants found in very small orbits ( periods @xmath0 8d ) about their parent stars  of which the prototype was the very first gas - giant exoplanet discovered , 51peg @xcite .",
    "it is believed that such short - period gas - giants can not have formed this close to their parent stars , and so must have migrated in , or been scattered in , from a more distant formation region @xcite .",
    "the measurement precisions that make the detection of such short - period exoplanets possible have over recent years continually improved for both doppler ( e.g. gl 876 d @xcite , gl 581 c @xcite , 61 vir b @xcite ) and transit ( e.g. kepler-4b @xcite ) detection .",
    "what then are the possible formation mechanisms that can produce such close - in terrestrial and super - terrestrial planets ?",
    "several models have been proposed for the formation of close - in terrestrial planets . @xcite",
    "have shown that super - earths could form interior to a migrating jovian planet .",
    "as they migrate inward , such gas - giants can shepherd planetary embryos interior to their orbits , which can then further collide and merge to generate earth - like planets @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that orbital migration and planet - planet scattering could potentially produce short - period super - earths @xcite .",
    "whatever the mechanism for their formation , it is likely that such planets are common around at least low - mass stars @xcite .    in all these scenarios ,",
    "the formation of short - period earth - like planets is associated with the migration of gas - giant planets . according to the core accretion paradigm for planetary formation",
    ", the isolation cores in the terrestrial planet formation region , and the solid cores of gas - giants , are both formed within @xmath1myr from kilometer - sized planetesimals @xcite .",
    "subsequently massive solid cores accrete disk gas to form giant planets @xcite at @xmath2myr , before the disk disperses @xcite . in the late stage of planet formation ,",
    "when giant planets have ceased migration after the gas disk clears , the disk of countless planetesimals and planetary embryos will become turbulent due to stirring by gas - giants over hundreds of million years ( or potentially even longer ) . in the meantime",
    ", it is expected that orbital crossings and giant impacts will frequently occur , which could lead to the formation of terrestrial planets @xcite and short - period earth - like planets .    in this letter , we present a potential new formation mechanism for short - period earth - like planets in the late stage of planet formation through a collision - merger scenario . in this mechanism , a planetary embryo",
    "is directly kicked to a close - in orbit after a collision with another embryo , and then the larger merged body is seized by the central star as a hot earth - like planet .",
    "extrasolar planetary systems that harbor pairs of jupiter - to - saturn - mass companions are of particular interest to researchers @xcite , e.g. , ogle-06 - 109lbc @xcite , 47umabc @xcite , gl876bc @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to consider whether it is likely that such systems might host additional hot terrestrial planets ( as , for example , the gl876 system does in the form of gl876d ",
    "@xcite ) , and further how such planets might form and evolve .",
    "we have therefore carried out simulations that explore such a system architecture .    in total , 30 runs were performed using a hybrid symplectic algorithm in the mercury package @xcite for following two such systems .",
    "the initial conditions of the two systems simulated were :    = -    - two giant planets are simulated with initial orbital parameters ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) @xmath6 ( 0.71m@xmath7 , 2.3au , 0.001 ) and ( 0.27m@xmath7 , 4.6au , 0.11 ) , to emulate the ogle-2006-blg-109l system @xcite .",
    "500 planetary embryos and planetesimals with total mass 10m@xmath8  were distributed between 0.3au @xmath9 5.2au and with @xmath10 .",
    "each of the 26 runs carried out over 400myr .",
    "- two giant planets are simulated with initial orbital parameters ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) @xmath6 ( 2.9m@xmath7 , 2.08au , 0.05 ) and ( 1.1m@xmath7 , 3.97au , 0.001 ) , to emulate the 47uma system @xcite .",
    "648 planetary objects with total mass of 5.14m@xmath8were distributed in the region 0.3au @xmath11",
    "1.6au with @xmath12 .",
    "each of the four runs evolved over 100myr .",
    "the other initial orbital elements of each planetary embryo ( or planetesimal ) are randomly generated  the arguments of periastron , longitudes of the ascending node , and mean anomalies range from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , and inclinations are from @xmath13 to @xmath15 . in addition , the hybrid integrator parameters are adopted as a stepsize of @xmath16 days ( @xmath17 a twentieth of a period for the innermost possible body at @xmath18au ) , and a bulirsch - stoer tolerance of @xmath19 . at the end of integration , the changes of energy and angular momenta are @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . in these runs , the gravitational interactions of all bodies are taken into account .",
    "two bodies are assumed to collide whenever the distance between them is less than the sum of their physical radii @xcite .",
    "if two objects collide , they are merged into a single body , without fragmentation , after the collision .",
    "in our simulations , we find that the collision - merger mechanism produces close - in terrestrial planets in 20% of the runs carried out ( 5 of 26 * simulation 1 * runs , and 1 of 4 * simulation 2 * runs ) .",
    "the simulations exhibit a classical planetary accretion scenario in their late stage formation @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : wide ] shows snapshots at various evolution times for a representative run of * simulation 1*. initially , the embryos and planetesimals reside in a cold disk , which is quickly stirred by the two gas - giants and excited to highly eccentric orbits within 0.1myr .",
    "we also see that three small bodies are involved in a 1:1 resonance with the inner giant by that time . by the end of 1myr ,",
    "most of the initial objects have been removed by ejection or collision due to frequent orbital crossings in this chaotic stage .",
    "in addition , we see that a close - in planet has formed at @xmath17 1myr which subsequently remains very stable . at the conclusion of the run ( 400myr ) ,",
    "three planetesimals survive , of which one has been seized as a trojan body by the inner giant , and the other two move at @xmath1au in eccentric orbits .",
    "+    figure [ fig2 ] shows the time evolution of the mass , semi - major axis , and eccentricity of the short - period terrestrial planet formed in the * simulation 1 * run shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wide ] . at 0.0356myr , two bodies that may be excited by secular resonance of gas - giants , collide at very high eccentricities ( @xmath22 = 0.91 and 0.80 , shown by the red and black lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , respectively ) and are then assumed to merge into a single planetary embryo .",
    "that merged body ( the remaining black line in fig . [ fig2 ] ) is captured by the parent star as a short - period planet , and its orbit dramatically shrinks from @xmath23au at the time of the collision , down to 0.077au .",
    "subsequently , three additional collisions take place over the further late - stage evolution of that merged object .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that the embryo moves slightly inward at each collision , and that its mass also increases .",
    "moreover , we note that it finally becomes a 3.3mercury - mass planet with a close - in orbit about 0.056au , and its eccentricity drops down to @xmath22=0.13 after the last collision .",
    "the orbit may then , of course , be further circularized by tidal interaction with the star over even longer timescales .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the formation and evolution of a similar terrestrial planet that emerges in one of the runs for * simulation 2*. at 2.2myr , the semi - major axis of a @xmath24mercury - mass embryo drops down from @xmath25au to 0.06au as a result of a collision with a highly - eccentric planetesimal excited more than a million years earlier .",
    "the merged body has an eccentricity that drops from 0.90 to 0.50 immediately after the impact .",
    "the enlarged , merged body subsequently undergoes additional collisions , and its eccentricity further evolves to @xmath22=0.33 ( after its last collision ) with a final mass of 1.3mercury - mass . here",
    ", the collision - merger scenario may provide some clues of the origins of the moderate eccentricities seen in super - earths detected to date ( e.g. , hd 181433 b @xcite ) .",
    "the major difference in the evolution of these two examples is that the short - period planet that evolved in * simulation 1 * was moved into an inner orbit at a very early stage , and subsequently accreted a majority of the mass available in nearby orbits ; while the * simulation 2 * planet had almost completed accretion into a mercury - mass embryo before it moved closer to the star . in all simulations ,",
    "we notice that terrestrial planets and bodies formed at short periods via collision - merger events come into being within 10 - 30 myr , which agrees with the estimated timescale of terrestrial core formation @xcite , as derived from the chronometry of meteorites and numerical simulations of terrestrial planet formation @xcite .",
    "in addition , we find that all survivors remain stable in their final configurations .",
    "these results indicate that a collision - merger mechanism could indeed produce short - period , terrestrial planets in two systems that host two gas - giants .",
    "similarly , we also find the above outcomes in other 4 runs .",
    "however , a natural question then arises  do the bodies that take part in these collisions really merge ? or will they become fragmented ?      in the accretion model of mercury ,",
    "a collision - merger scenario occurs whenever the distance between two bodies is less than the sum of their physical radii @xcite , and the package models the two bodies merging inelastically to form a single new body that conserves mass and total momentum .",
    "the collisions in the runs , therefore , are considered to be perfect gravitational aggregations , which assumes that enough energy is dissipated in the collision for the two bodies to remain gravitationally bound .",
    "however , actual collisions could have a result that ranges anywhere from this result ( complete merger ) , through partial fragmentation , to the complete shattering and disintegration of both impactors .",
    "@xcite .    whether these bodies either fragment or cohere in a collision will obviously depend on the ",
    "currently poorly understood  physical properties of the colliding bodies @xcite .",
    "what can be said is that the outcome will be extremely complicated . to assess the likely state of the merger vs fragmentation for two bodies in a collision , we can",
    ", though , make order - of - magnitude estimates .",
    "consider two bodies of the same mass @xmath26 , with relative velocity at infinity @xmath27 , and the sum of the physical radii @xmath28 .",
    "the collision velocity for a head - on collision between them is @xcite , @xmath29 where @xmath30=@xmath31 is the escape velocity at the point of collision , a parameter used to evaluate whether they will physically collide .",
    "take the coefficient of restitution as @xmath32 , then accretion will result if @xmath33 , even if the initial impact results in fragmentation into two bodies .",
    "conversely , the bodies will be unbound if @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the threshold value of the coefficient of restitution for these outcomes is @xcite , @xmath35 this shows that if @xmath36 , merger and growth is likely unless collision is totally elastic ; whereas @xmath37 leads to fragmentation .    for the * simulation 1 * run shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we have used the above equations to assess the outcome of the first collision as it happens between two identical mercury - like embryos , which allows us to make a rough evaluation of the likely outcome by calculating the instantaneous velocities of the impactors at the epoch just before the collision .",
    "now we notice that at the first collision the body was impacted onto a close - in orbit .",
    "the @xmath30 of the two impactors are nearly the same  3.12kms@xmath38 ( assuming equal bulk density ) ; the velocities of the impactors at the collision epoch near the pericenter are estimated to be 43.21kms@xmath38 and 35.50kms@xmath38 , respectively , thus we have an approximate relative velocity projected to the relative position of two colliding bodies of 13.49kms@xmath38 . in this case",
    ", a merger requires @xmath39 , which is close to the accretion condition ( @xmath40 ) in realistic accretion model for head - on collision @xcite .",
    "on the basis of above analysis , a merger seem to be possible for two eccentric objects when the collision occurs in the nearby region of central star , subsequently the merged body is seized by the star at close - in orbit . in the collision - merger process , moderate energy should be released , and they could be converted into the internal heat of the merger in the collision between embryos , e.g. , simulations of a supposed moon - forming impact show that the collision can deliver prodigious energy to the earth , which could lead the proto - earth to a mixed solid - melt state @xcite .. additional energy loss may arise from the ejection of other embryos or transfer to the envelope and core of giant planets @xcite . ]",
    "we also obtain similar results for the * simulation 2 * run shown in fig .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed that a large mass ratio between two impactors will tend to lead to merger and aggregation  the accretion probability is @xmath41% ( averaged over all impact parameters ) for average mass ratio of 1:5 .",
    "this suggests that the first collision seen in this run , where the mass ratio of 1:3.43 , is likely to result in a merger .",
    "we have uncovered a new mechanism for producing short - period terrestrial planets via collisions - mergers in the late stages of planetary formation . in this mechanism ,",
    "two highly - eccentric bodies first undergo a severe orbital crossing and then form a short - period planet via collision - merger . in the set of simulations performed to date , this mechanism produces a short - period , terrestrial planet in 20@xmath42 of runs .    as mentioned previously",
    ", the formation rate for short - period terrestrial planets via a collision - merger process is only a moderate 20% .",
    "however , this low rate may be a result of the limits imposed on our simulations by current computational capabilities , which restrict our adopted population of embryos and planetesimals to a few hundred objects with a total mass of only several times that of the earth .",
    "the resultant planetesimal disk in our simulations is much smaller than that of the minimum mass solar nebula ( @xmath43 @xmath44 within 30au @xcite )  which would also contain billions of small bodies . increasing the number of bodies and the total mass of the proto - planetary disk would likely increase the efficiency with which this mechanism produces short - period terrestrial planets .",
    "in addition , it is worth noting that close - in planets emerge from our simulations within a few million years .",
    "this is a significantly shorter timescale than the billion years over which the solar system is thought to have undergone significant evolution .",
    "so , while near - infrared observations of young cluster samples , indicate an overall dust disk lifetime of @xmath45myr @xcite , the planetary system will actually continue to evolve over much longer timescales following the clearing of the dust and gas disk . during this late stage of planetary formation , frequent orbital crossings and huge impacts will occur , which are likely to significantly boost the feasibility of collision - merger events producing short - period terrestrial bodies .",
    "the collision - merger scenario for the formation of short - period planets does not require perfect accretion .",
    "rather it relies on the collisions pushing the resultant body inward , so that the central star can capture it as a short - period planet . in this sense",
    ", such a mechanism could play a key role in throwing the largest fragments resulting from severe impacts into short - period orbits . on the other hand ,",
    "given the diversity in the architectures of currently known systems , exoplanets are likely to form through a variety of mechanisms rather than through a uniform dominant process ( d. lin 2009 , private communication ) .",
    "our simulation results show one potential mechanism for the origin of short - period terrestrial planets in a compact disk with two gas - giants , and may predict an abundance of close - in bodies for this family ."
