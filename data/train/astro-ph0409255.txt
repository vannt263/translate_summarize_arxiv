    "gravitational radiation , described as a tensor perturbation to the metric travelling at the speed of light , is a natural consequence of einstein s general relativity .",
    "it has been recognised ( e.g. , thorne 1987 ) that black hole binaries are among the most important sources of gravitational waves ( gw ) , both for ground based interferometers such as _ ligo _ ( abramovici 1992 ) and _ virgo _ ( bradaschia 1990 ) , and for the planned _ laser interferometer space antenna _ ( _ lisa _ , bender 1994 ) .",
    "interferometers operate as all - sky monitors , and the data streams collect the contributions from a large number of sources belonging to different cosmic populations .",
    "a precise determination of stochastic gw backgrounds from different classes of astrophysical objects is therefore crucial to interpret the data . while a gw background may provide information on the number density , redshift evolution , and mass function of the emitting population , confusion noises add to the instrumental noise limiting the possibility of detecting other class of objects",
    "moreover , to optimize the subtraction of resolved sources from the data stream , it is important to have a detailed description of the expected rate , duration , amplitude , and waveforms of events .",
    "_ lisa _ will operate in the frequency range 0.01 mhz - 1 hz , where gw emission from a cosmological population of massive black hole binaries ( mbhbs ) is expected to be important ( haehnelt 1994 ) . today",
    ", massive black holes ( mbhs ) are ubiquitous in the nuclei of nearby galaxies ( see , e.g. , magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) . if mbhs were also common in the past , and if their host galaxies experience multiple mergers during their lifetime , as dictated by popular cold dark matter hierarchical cosmologies , then mbhbs will inevitably form in large numbers during cosmic history .",
    "the formation and evolution of mbhs has been investigated recently by several groups ( e.g. , menou , haiman & narayanan 2001 ; volonteri 2003 ) , and the expected gw signal from inspiraling mbh binaries has been first discussed by rajagopal & romani ( 1995 ) , and recently by jaffe & backer ( 2003 ) , wyithe & loeb ( 2003 ) , sesana ( 2004 , hereafter paper i ) , and enoki ( 2004 ) .    in paper i we computed the gw background from mbhbs and the number of coalescences observable by _ lisa _ in a 3-year mission , adopting the scenario for the assembly and growth of mbhs proposed by volonteri ( 2003a , b ) . in such model , ``",
    "seed '' holes are placed within rare high - density regions ( minihalos ) above the cosmological jeans and cooling mass at redshift 20 .",
    "their evolution is followed through monte carlo realizations of the halo merger hierarchy combined with semi - analytical descriptions of the main dynamical processes , such as dynamical friction against the dark matter background , the shrinking of mbh binaries via three - body interactions , their coalescence driven by the emission of gravitational waves , and the recoil associated with the non - zero net linear momentum carried away by gws in the coalescence of two unequal mass black holes ( the `` gravitational rocket '' ) .",
    "major halo mergers lead to mbh fueling and trigger quasar activity . in this paper",
    "we use the same model to provide a more detailed characterization of the gw signal from inspiraling mbhbs .",
    "their contribution to the _ lisa _ data stream is twofold : unresolved sources will give origin to confusion noise to be compared to instrumental noise and other astrophysical stochastic backgrounds ( e.g. from white dwarf binaries , farmer & phinney 2003 ) , while resolved inspiraling binaries will probe gravity in extreme conditions ( e.g. , vecchio 2004 ) . confusion noise and resolved sources should provide different cosmological information .",
    "the former , produced by a large number of unresolved mbhbs , will trace light mbhbs at very high redshift , placing constraints on black hole formation scenarios prior to the reionization epoch ; the latter will be a formidable tool to follow the cosmic evolution of mbhs and the formation and dynamics of mbh binaries following galaxy mergers .",
    "the plan is as follows . in   2 we review the basics of the detection of gw from mbhbs , defining observable quantities such as the characteristic strain amplitude , signal - to - noise ratio , and source detection rate . in ",
    "3 we briefly summarize our scenario for the cosmological evolution of galaxy halos and associated holes . in   4 we present confusion noise levels and source number counts .",
    "finally , in  5 we discuss our results .",
    "following thorne ( 1996 ) , an interferometer can be characterized by two different sensitivity curves , depending on the type of signal one expects to detect , i.e. a  burst \" or a  periodic \" gw source .",
    "a burst , a short - lived signal whose waveform can be utterly complicated , can be described in terms of a characteristic strain amplitude @xmath13 at the observed frequency @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the duration of the signal ( thorne 1987 ) .",
    "the spread of the power spectrum around @xmath16 will be @xmath17 . at the other extreme , a perfectly periodic source emits , for the entire duration of the observation , at a fixed frequency @xmath18 .",
    "the power spectrum will be peaked at @xmath18 , with a spread @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of wave cycles clipped into the observation . in this respect",
    ", a burst can be thought as a single complete waveform with @xmath21 . in the case of a periodic signal ,",
    "the interferometer sensitivity is increased by the fact that , across the observing interval @xmath22 , the signal is repeated @xmath23 times .",
    "the sensitivity to bursts ( @xmath24 ) and to periodic signals ( @xmath25 ) are related by : @xmath26 in figure [ sensitivity ] the two curves @xmath24 and @xmath25 are compared for an assumed 3-year _ lisa _ observation .",
    "the curves are obtained combining the _ lisa _ single - arm michelson sensitivity curve ( taken from the url www.srl.caltech.edu/@xmath27shane/sensitivity ) with the recent analysis of the _ lisa _ instrumental noise below @xmath28 hz ( bender 2003 , extended from @xmath29 hz to @xmath30 hz with a constant slope ) .",
    "consider now a periodic signal of finite duration , with strain amplitude @xmath31 .",
    "the total energy carried by the wave will be proportional to the number of wave cycles @xmath32 spent at that particular frequency .",
    "the quantity to be compared with @xmath24 is then the  characteristic \" strain @xmath33 .",
    "note that for a periodic signal at frequency @xmath18 lasting for a time interval longer than the observation time @xmath22 , we have simply @xmath34 .",
    "then , the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath10 increases by the same factor one would obtain comparing @xmath31 to @xmath25 in equation ( [ eqburstperiodic ] ) .",
    "the former approach , i.e. comparing @xmath13 to @xmath24 rather than @xmath31 to @xmath25 , is more general , as it allows us to characterize the @xmath10 not only for perfectly periodic signals ( @xmath34 ) , or for bursts ( @xmath35 ) , but also for events in which the emitted frequency shifts to increasingly larger values during the spiral - in phase of the binary system . in the latter case , @xmath36 represents the number of cycles spent in a frequency interval @xmath37 around frequency @xmath18 , and hence @xmath13 is the strain in a logarithmic frequency interval ( flanagan & hughes 1998 ) .",
    "typically , the timescale for frequency shift is long compared to the wave period , and short compared to the duration of the observation . only close to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , the gw frequency changes at a rate comparable to the frequency itself ( @xmath38 and hence @xmath39 ) . in figure",
    "[ sensitivity ] we also show @xmath31 and @xmath13 for two representative binary systems .",
    "one should note that the true observable gw signal is , for @xmath40 ( the  knee \" frequency in the @xmath13 curves ) , lower than @xmath31 , as for these high frequencies the source is not monochromatic over the observation time .",
    "such simply consideration naturally leads to define @xmath13 and @xmath24 .",
    "consider now a binary system at comoving distance @xmath41 .",
    "the strain amplitude ( sky - and - polarisation averaged ) at the rest - frame frequency @xmath42 is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the `` chirp mass '' of the binary , and all the other symbols have their standard meaning .",
    "the strain is averaged over a wave period . the rest - frame energy flux ( energy per unit area per unit time ) associated to the gw",
    "is @xmath45 as discussed above , the important quantity to consider is the number of cycles spent in a frequency interval @xmath37 around a given frequency @xmath18 . assuming that the backreaction from gw emission dominates the orbital decay of a binary , during the spiral - in phase one can write @xmath46 where we have used the rest - frame frequency shift rate @xmath47 note that @xmath32 can be computed either in the rest or in the observer frame .",
    "the characteristic strain in an observation of ( observed ) duration @xmath22 is then @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the observed frequency .",
    "using parseval theorem , it is easy to see that @xmath13 is related to the fourier transform of the strain @xmath51 , as @xmath52 , where @xmath51 is defined over the positive frequency axis .",
    "the specific energy per unit area is then @xmath53 and , from equation ( [ eq1h_c ] ) , we obtain @xmath54 note that @xmath55 , while ( eq . [ eqenergyflux ] ) @xmath56 .      in an operating interferometer , any stochastic signal will add up ( in quadrature ) to @xmath24 to form the effective rms noise of the instrument , @xmath57 .",
    "an inspiraling binary is then detected if the signal - to - noise ratio _ integrated over the observation _ is larger than the assumed threshold for detection , where the integrated @xmath10 is given by @xmath58 ^ 2}. \\label{eqsn}\\ ] ] here , @xmath18 is the ( observed ) frequency emitted at the starting time @xmath59 of the observation , and @xmath60 is the ( observed ) frequency shift in a time @xmath22 starting from @xmath18 .",
    "the latter is implicitly given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "the frequency at the isco is , strictly speaking , defined only in the test particle limit @xmath63 . in the general case , various estimate of the transition point from in - spiral to plunge exist , and differ by a factor of 3 at most ( e.g. , kidder , will & wiseman 1993 ; cook 1994 ) .",
    "such uncertainties do not affect our results in any manner , so we use , for the observed frequency at the isco , the conventional keplerian defintion : @xmath64 replacing @xmath65 with @xmath66 in equation ( [ eqfmax ] ) gives @xmath67 , the time needed to span the frequency interval @xmath68 $ ] , to be compared _ a priori _ to @xmath22 . in the case",
    "@xmath69 , we then set @xmath70 in equation ( [ eqsn ] ) .",
    "in figure [ singlesource ] we plot @xmath13 for different mbhbs at different redshifts , compared to the _ lisa _ @xmath57 ( see   4.1 ) multiplied by a factor of 5 , assuming a 3-year observation . if @xmath71 , then the signal has , approximately , an integrated @xmath72 .",
    "this is for illustrative purposes only , as the actual @xmath10 must be integrated over the observing period using equation ( [ eqsn ] ) .    at frequencies higher than the `` knee '' , the time spent around a given frequency is less than 3 years , and @xmath73 .",
    "the signal shifts toward higher frequency during the observation , and reaches the isco and the coalescence phase in most cases .",
    "the lowest curve represents a low mass , high redshift equal mass binary .",
    "as we shall see below , these sources are common in our hierarchical model for mbh assembly . in terms of their detectability by _",
    ", they represent a somewhat different class of events .",
    "contrary to the case of more massive binaries present at lower @xmath74 , the final coalescence phase of light binaries lies at too high frequecies , well below the _ lisa _ threshold .    for frequencies much below the knee ,",
    "the characteristic strain is proportional to @xmath75 , as the timescale for frequency shift is longer than 3 years .",
    "the signal amplitude is then limited by the observation time , not by the intrinsic properties of the source .",
    "the source will be observed as a  stationary source \" , a quasi - monochromatic wave for the whole duration of the observation .",
    "an increase in the observation time will result in a shift of the knee toward lower frequencies .",
    "the time needed for the sources to reach the isco starting from the knee frequency is , approximatively , the observing time .",
    "figure [ singlesource ] shows that very few stationary sources above threshold should be expected anyway .",
    "given a coalescence rate @xmath76 , using the frequency shift rate @xmath77 ( eq .",
    "[ eqdotf ] ) , we can solve for the mean number of _ individual _ binaries resolved during an observing period @xmath22 .",
    "we begin considering that a mbhb spans , during its lifetime , a finite frequency range , @xmath78 , where the lower limit is set to the observed frequency at the hardening radius ( quinlan 1996 ) .",
    "then , from continuity , the number of individual observable mbhbs can be computed as @xmath79 the first term is simply the integrated density of sources in the frequency domain , and does not depend on @xmath22 .",
    "it is the number of sources caught in a snapshot of the entire sky .",
    "the second term is the number of new binaries born ( at frequency @xmath80 ) during the observation time @xmath22 , and must be equal to the number of coalescences within the same period .    the general argument above does not consider that real detections must be above a specified minimum @xmath10 , where the @xmath10 is given by equation ( [ eqsn ] ) . including a threshold criterium , the number of mbhbs with @xmath81 in an observation of duration @xmath22 is then @xmath82 where @xmath83 in the second term of equation ( [ eqbinsn ] ) , which again accounts for the new binaries formed at the hardening radius , @xmath84 is the frequency reached after 3 years starting from @xmath80 , and the function @xmath85 is evaluated by integration of the @xmath10 from @xmath80 to @xmath18 . given the exceedingly low value of @xmath80 , this second term is totally negligible for an experiment such as _",
    "the theory and method outlined in the previous sections allow us to fully characterize the expected contribution of mbhbs in the spiral - in phase to the _ lisa _ data stream , once the coalescence rate of mbhbs is specified . in this work",
    "a hierarchical structure formation scenario for the assembly and growth of mbhs in which seed holes form far up in the dark halo `` merger tree '' is assumed .",
    "we use exactly the same model discussed in volonteri ( 2003a , 2003b ) and in paper i. its main features are briefly summarized in this section .",
    "we track backwards the merger history of 220 parent halos with present - day masses in the range @xmath86 with a monte carlo algorithm based on the extended press - schechter formalism ( see , e.g. , cole 2000 ) .",
    "seed holes with @xmath87 are placed within rare high - density regions ( minihalos ) above the cosmological jeans and cooling mass at redshift 20 .",
    "their evolution and growth is followed through monte carlo realizations of the halo merger hierarchy combined with semi - analytical descriptions of the main dynamical processes , such as dynamical friction against the dark matter background , the shrinking of mbhbs via three - body interactions , their coalescence from the emission of gravitational waves , triple mbh interactions , and the effect of gravitational recoil .",
    "quasar activity is triggered during major mergers .",
    "we assume that the more massive hole accretes , at the eddington rate , a gas mass fraction that scales with the fifth power of the host halo circular velocity ( ferrarese 2002 ) .    in a typical merger event ,",
    "dynamical friction drives the satellite halo toward the centre of the new forming system , leading to the formation of a bound mbhb in the violently relaxed stellar core .",
    "as the binary separation decays , the effectiveness of dynamical friction slowly declines ; the bound pair then hardens by capturing stars passing within a distance of the order of the binary semi - major axis and ejecting them at much higher velocities ( gravitational slingshot ) .",
    "the heating of the surrounding stars by a decaying mbh pair creates a low - density core out of a preexisting stellar cusp , slowing down further binary hardening ( see , e.g. , milosavljevic & merritt 2001 ) .",
    "if the hardening continues sufficiently far , gw emission takes over , driving the pair to coalescence .",
    "figure [ figrate ] shows the number of mbhb coalescences per unit redshift per unit observed year predicted by our model : we expect @xmath88 coalescences per year , the vast majority involving quite light binaries ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the model was shown to reproduce rather well the observed luminosity function of optically - selected quasars in the redshift range @xmath90 and the evolution of the nuclear mbh mass density with cosmic time ( volonteri 2003a ) , and to provide a quantitative explanation to the stellar cores observed today in bright ellipticals as a result of the cumulative eroding action of shrinking mbhbs ( volonteri 2003b ) .",
    "the customary definition of gw confusion noise level is the amplitude at which there is , on average , at least one source per frequency resolution bin .",
    "the frequency bin width is @xmath91 , so the longer the observation , the smaller the noise . as pointed out by cornish ( 2003 ) ,",
    "the crude ",
    "one bin rule \" is much too simple to properly describe a binary system . using detailed information theory , cornish ( 2003 )",
    "shows that a gw background becomes unresolvable when there is , on average , at least one source per eight bins .    in the last decade",
    "a considerable effort has gone into quantifying the galactic and extragalactic confusion noise in the band 0.01 mhz - 1 hz ( e.g. , schneider 2000 ; freitag 2001 ; nelemans 2001 ; farmer & phinney 2003 ) .",
    "we have then applied the ",
    "eight bin rule \" to asses the confusion noise associated with the evolving population of mbhbs , compared to the most recent estimates of the noises from galactic ( nelemeans 2001 ,  one bin \" rule , 1 year observation ) and extragalactic ( farmer & phinney 2003 ,  one - bin \" rule , 3-year observation ) white dwarf ( wd ) binaries . as shown in figure [ noise ] , mbhbs produce confusion noise at @xmath92 hz .",
    "figure [ noise ] also shows the global _ lisa _ @xmath57 , along with separate contributions from different source populations .",
    "though , as expected , mbhb stochastic noise dominates over wd - wd signals at low frequencies , it lies more than an order of magnitude below the instrumental _ lisa _ sensitivity curve , and hence its contribution to the _ lisa _ @xmath57 can be ignored . on the other hand",
    ", this hampers the possibility that _ lisa _ could take advantage of the mbhb noise to probe the cosmological evolution of such particular parent population .",
    "we have divided the resolved sources into  merging \" and  in - spiral \" binaries ( mbs and ibs , respectively ) .",
    "the former are those binaries that reach the isco during the duration of the observation with a signal above threshold .",
    "these events are of particular importance , as they probe strong field effects and represent a unique chance of observing the coalescence and ring - down phases of mbhbs .",
    "resolved ibs , instead , do not allow a direct observation of the coalescence phase .",
    "these events arise from light binaries whose final coalescence phase lies below threshold , and from binaries of all masses with @xmath93 years at the very start of the observation .",
    "we expect very few ibs in this last stage anyway , because binaries above threshold have typically @xmath94 years when the observation starts ( see fig .",
    "[ singlesource ] ) .",
    "an example of a resolved ib is represented by the lowest curve of figure [ singlesource ] .",
    "mbhbs in this class have an integrated @xmath10 above threshold , though the coalescence phase occur at too high frequency to be directly observed by _",
    "lisa_.    an obvious consequence of our classification is that mbs have larger mass and a lower redshift than ibs .",
    "the mass distribution of the most massive member of the binary @xmath95 is shown in figure [ massfunction ] .",
    "the differential and cumulative redshift distributions are plotted in figure [ diffcounts ] and figure [ cumcounts ] , respectively .",
    "detectable ibs are @xmath96 in total , and account for almost all of the mbhbs observed at @xmath97 .",
    "conversely , the rarer mbs ( @xmath98 in total ) are confined to the redshift interval @xmath99 .",
    "figure [ massratio ] shows the average mass ratio @xmath100 for mbs and ibs . as expected , this is larger for ibs , given their larger average redshift .",
    "the ratio decreases at low redshift , as a consequence of the complicated merger history of host dark matter halos .",
    "the reason why the average mass ratio of mbs peaks at @xmath101 lies in the fact that both the probability of halo mergers ( because of the steep p&s halo mass function ) and the dynamical friction timescale increase with decreasing halo mass ratio . hence , fast equal mass mergers are rare , while in more common unequal mass mergers it takes longer than an hubble time to drag the satellite hole to the centre .",
    "we can define the detection efficiency of a specific mission as the number of observable events divided by the expected number of coalescences in the same time interval .",
    "figure [ eff ] shows the global ( mbs+ibs ) detection efficiency for _ lisa _ and the efficiency considering as  detections \" only mbs .",
    "the large gw - brightness of mbhbs is such that _ lisa _ will observe @xmath11% of all coalescences occurring at @xmath12 .",
    "the efficiency falls below @xmath102 only for mbhbs at @xmath103 .",
    "the efficiency to mbs only is , obviously , lower .",
    "figure [ eff ] shows that a space  based interferometer such as _ lisa _ can directly observe the final stage of the spiral - in phase of about half of all mbhbs coalescing at @xmath104 .",
    "in this paper we have characterized the gw signal produced by cosmological mbhbs , and we have then folded the signal into the _ lisa _ performance capabilities .",
    "we find that _ lisa _ should resolve more than 90% of all cosmological coalescences of mbhbs occurring at @xmath12 .",
    "the detection efficiency is already @xmath105 for mbhbs at @xmath106 .",
    "we showed that the confusion noise from residual unresolved mbhbs is expected to be at least an order of magnitude below _",
    "instrumental noise .",
    "we have divided the resolved events into merging and in - spiral binaries .",
    "mbs are associated with systems at relatively low redshift involving heavy pairs ( @xmath107 m@xmath108 ) .",
    "their strong gw signal can be used to study the orbital evolution of the pair until the isco , allowing to test gr in extreme conditions . on the contrary ,",
    "ibs are less massive pairs at higher redshift .",
    "such systems can be generally observed , with moderate integrated @xmath10 , only for a relatively short amount of time , from few weeks to few months , before the isco is reached .",
    "ibs are nevertheless important as they push the limit of observable mbhbs out to @xmath109 , and allow studies of the formation and assembly of seed holes of intermediate masses",
    ". binaries at even earlier epochs , while common in our model , are unfortunately too light to be observed by _ lisa _ with a relevant @xmath10 .    in our refined study ,",
    "the @xmath110 `` stationary sources '' discussed in paper i , i.e. sources whose shift in frequencies @xmath60 during the observing period is @xmath111 , appear to be undetectable .",
    "this is because a too optimistic sensitivity threshold for _ lisa _ was assumed in paper i for frequencies below 0.1 mhz , where most of the stationary sources are expected .",
    "indeed , an order of magnitude improvement of the _ lisa _ sensitivity below 0.1 mhz would lead to the detection of @xmath112 of such events .",
    "we stress here that our results may be sensitive to different model parameters and assumptions .",
    "as done in paper i , we explore such possibility by running test models in which the hardening timescale @xmath113 was divided and multiplyied by a factor of 3 .",
    "the resulting coalescence rates are plotted in figure [ figrate ] .",
    "we find 50 coalescences per observed year in the  slow hardening case \" and 78 in the  fast hardening \" case , compared to 64 in our reference model . in terms of _ lisa _ number counts , the effects are small . in the slow hardening case ,",
    "the coalescence rate decreases at @xmath114 as a large fraction of binaries has @xmath113 longer than the then hubble time @xmath115 . at lower redshifts",
    "it is @xmath116 anyway , the coalescence rate is basically unaffected with respect to the fiducial case , and so are the number counts ( both for mbs and ibs ) . to obtain a significative reduction of observable sources , @xmath113 must increase by a larger factor , so that also mbhbs in the range @xmath117 will have @xmath118 . by increasing @xmath113 by an order of magnitude",
    ", we find the number of coalescences per observed year decreasing to 30 : in a 3-year observation _ lisa _ would detect @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) mbs ( ibs ) .",
    "note that , as increasing @xmath113 results in a lower average redshift of coalescences , this also increases the global detection efficiency . in other words",
    ", there are less sources , but a larger fraction of them is detectable .    in the fast hardening case , more binaries can coalesce at early times , and the number of surviving mbhbs at @xmath121 decreases .",
    "this ultimately causes a slight reduction in the number of ibs observable by _ lisa _ ( 49 in 3 years , compared to 55 ) . from figure [ figrate ]",
    ", it is also evident that , for @xmath12 , the coalescence rate is almost identical to the standard case , implying that the number of detectable mbs will remain approximately the same .    in figure [ massratio ] , we showed that ibs have an average mass ratio higher than mbs . to check whether this result depends on our assumption of equal - mass seed holes",
    ", we ran a test model with a flat initial mass function for the seed , @xmath122m@xmath108 .",
    "the resulting binary mass distribution relevant for _ lisa _ was basically unaffected .",

    "their characteristic strain lies just above the _ lisa _ threshold at frequencies of the order of @xmath123 hz ( see fig .",
    "[ singlesource ] ) where confusion noises from unresolved galactic and extragalactic wd - wd binaries dominate the sensitivity curve ( see fig . [ noise ] ) .",
    "wd - wd confusion noise levels are difficult to compute because of the many uncertainties in stellar population synthesis models , and in estimating the fraction of binary stars in galaxies . in our fiducial sensitivity curve",
    "we have added to the _ lisa _ effective noise the galactic wd - wd confusion noise computed by nelemans et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and the extragalactic wd - wd confusion noise estimated by farmer @xmath124 phinney ( 2003 ) .",
    "note that nelemans ( 2001 ) assumed 1 , rather than 3 , year integration , and both estimates employ the one bin rule . using the eight bin rule we expect these noises to increase to some extent , but differences should be small .",

    "compared to unresolved galactic wd - wd binaries , the uncertainties in the extragalactic wd - wd confusion noise are much larger , and may have a more relevant impact on number counts . the estimate of schneider et al .",
    "( 2000 ) lies nearly a factor of four above farmer & phinney s `` fiducial '' model , and this leads to a significant reduction of observable ibs , from 55 to 44 .",
    "the lowest estimate we could find in the literature was farmer & phinney s `` pessimistic '' model , which is about a factor of four lower than their fiducial one ; in this case we count 63 observable ibs .",
    "another potential source of noise in the frequency range 1 - 10 mhz is captures of compact objects ( white dwarfs , neutron stars , and stellar - mass black holes ) by mbhs in galaxy centers .",
    "capture rates are quite uncertain , and estimates of relevant confusion noises span more than an order of magnitude in @xmath13 ( see barack & cutler 2004 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "we have estimated the impact of compact object captures on _ lisa _ number counts assuming the more optimistic rates calculated by freitag ( 2001 ) .",
    "the number of observable ibs decreases in this case to 43 .",
    "more conservative rate estimates do not affect appreciably the counts .    to summarise , in the context of our model , we can assign an approximate error of @xmath125% to the number of high-@xmath74 mbhbs detectable by _",

    "<S> we extend and refine our previous analysis ( sesana 2004 ) , detailing the gravitational wave signal expected from a cosmological population of massive black hole binaries . as done in our previous paper , we follow the merger history of dark matter halos , the dynamics of the massive black holes they host , and their growth via gas accretion and binary coalescences in a @xmath1cdm cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> stellar dynamical processes dominates the orbital evolution of black hole binaries at large separations , while gravitational wave emission takes over at small radii , causing the final coalescence of the pairs . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the gw signal from this population , in a 3 year _ </S>",
    "<S> lisa _ observation , will be resolved into @xmath2 discrete events with @xmath3 , among which @xmath4 will be observed above threshold until coalescence . </S>",
    "<S> these  merging events \" involve relatively massive binaries , @xmath5 , in the redshift range @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining @xmath7 events come from higher redshift , less massive binaries ( @xmath8 at @xmath9 ) and , although their @xmath10 integrated over the duration of the observation can be substantial , the final coalescence phase is at too high frequency to be directly observable by space  </S>",
    "<S> based interferometers such as _ lisa_. _ lisa _ will be able to detect a fraction @xmath11% of all the coalescences of massive black hole binaries occurring at @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the residual confusion noise from unresolved massive black hole binaries is expected to be at least an order of magnitude below the estimated stochastic noise . </S>"
