    "the low energy excitations of a topologically non - trivial phase have remarkable properties .",
    "a well - known example is the quasihole excitation of the laughlin state in the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) , which carries fractional charge and anyon statistics . the most intriguing possibility of a topological phase of matter is the nonabelian fqhe proposed by moore and read @xcite for even - denominator filling factors , e.g. @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the quasiparticle excitations , vortices in the moore - read pfaffian wave function , have non - abelian statistics @xcite which plays a fundamental role in topological quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient in the moore - read pfaffian state is that the topologically nontrivial part of the wave function is asymptomatically the same as the pair wave function in a @xmath6-wave fermion paired state @xcite in the weak pairing phase @xcite .",
    "the existence of the exotic non - abelian statistics is thus likely a generic property of the more tangible time - reversal symmetry ( t - symmetry ) breaking p - wave pairing states .",
    "recently , kitaev constructed a spin-@xmath0 model with link - dependent ising couplings on the honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "kitaev showed that the model is equivalent to a bilinear majorana fermion model and is thus exactly soluble . a topological non - trivial gapless phase ( the b phase ) was discovered.(a jordan - wigner transformation to a model with two - majorana fermions for this model has been proposed in @xcite ) . in the presence of a t - symmetry breaking term",
    ", the b phase becomes gapped and exhibits vortex excitations obeying nonabelian statistics .",
    "the model also has a topologically trivial , gapped a phase .",
    "the two phases are separated by a topological phase transition via a gapless critical state .",
    "these properties strongly resemble the weak and strong pairing phases and the critical state in the @xmath6-wave paired states of spinless fermions @xcite .    the interconnections among the kitaev model , the @xmath2-wave paired fermions , and the moore - read pfaffian and its excitations have not been well understood previously . in particular , it is important to understand the universal properties among these systems , analogous to finding the universality class in statistical mechanics models . in this paper",
    ", we show that the kitaev model is a special case of a broader class of two - dimensional spin-@xmath0 models whose ground states are equivalent to general paired fermion states in the p - wave channel . indeed , the vortex - free kitaev hamiltonian maps to an exact bcs fermion pairing model with @xmath7-wave attractions on a square lattice @xcite .",
    "our generalized model includes both the @xmath6 wave paired states and the original kitaev model as special limits .",
    "it is an exactly soluble model with minimal three and four - spin interactions .",
    "we show that the vortex - free ground states of this model are described by @xmath1-wave paired fermion states with tunable pairing order parameters @xmath8 on a square lattice .",
    "we find that the structure of the phase diagram is determined by the geometry of the underlying fermi surface .",
    "it contains both topologically trivial ( a ) and nontrivial ( b ) phases .",
    "the a phase is always gapped and corresponds to the strong pairing phase .",
    "the b phase can be either gapped or gapless even if t - symmetry is broken .",
    "we find that gapless excitations in the b phase is protected by a generalized inversion ( g - inversion ) symmetry under @xmath9 and the emergence of a gapped b phase is thus tied to g - inversion symmetry breaking .",
    "for instance , the @xmath6 wave paired state is gapped while @xmath10-wave paired state is gapless although they both break the t - symmetry .",
    "the critical states of the a - b phase transition remains gapless whether or not t- and g - inversion symmetries are broken , indicative of its topological nature .",
    "indeed , if all @xmath8 are tuned to zero , the topological a - b phase transition is from a band insulator to a free fermi gas .",
    "the fermi surface shrinks to a point zero at criticality .",
    "we show that the gapped b phase is a weak pairing state while the g - inversion symmetric ground states are extended .",
    "the gapless phase was not well - understood before .",
    "we show that the effective theory near the phase boundary corresponds to 1 + 1-dimensional massless majorana fermions in the long wave length limit , i.e. , a @xmath4 conformal field theory or the 2-dimensional ising model .",
    "the vortex excitations are important in the family of kitaev models since the vortex excitations may obey anyon statistics @xcite .",
    "the vortex excitation energies have been numerically estimated in the a phase @xcite and the b phase @xcite .",
    "we study the vortex excitations in the gapped b phase in the continuum limit and show that the vortex pair excitations cost a finite energy .",
    "this is consistent with the results of numerical calculations @xcite and suggests that vortex excitations may have well - defined statistics .",
    "we extend the kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice by introducing minimal three- and four - spin terms in the hamiltonian , @xmath11 where @xmath12 are pauli matrices , @xmath13-,@xmath14-,@xmath15-links are shown in fig .",

    "@xmath77 vanish at @xmath78 and therefore , this triangle is the gapless critical boundary separating the a and b phases . outside the triangle , @xmath79 .",

    "the pair correlation @xmath81 is analytic near @xmath82 , implying tightly bound pairs in positional space and hence the a - phase as the strong - pairing phase ( see below for detailed discussions ) @xcite .",
    "the global structure of the phase diagram is invariant in the generalized @xmath83 space because our minimal three- and four - spin extension does not change the topology of the underlying fermi surface .",

    "otherwise , the b phase is gapped .",
    "note that contrary to conventional wisdom , t - symmetry breaking alone does not guarantee a gap opening in the b phase .",
    "the symmetry reason behind the gapless condition of the b phase becomes clear in the continuum limit where @xmath87 implies that the vortex - free hamiltonian must be invariant , up to a constant , under the transformation @xmath92 and @xmath93 with @xmath94 with @xmath95 or @xmath96 and for nonzero @xmath97 .",
    "we refer to this as a _ generalized inversion ( g - inversion ) symmetry _ since it reduces to the usual mirror reflection when @xmath98 .",
    "this ( projective ) symmetry protects the gapless nature of fermionic excitations and may be associated with the underlying quantum order @xcite .",
    "kitaev s original model has @xmath99 , and is thus g - inversion invariant and gapless . the magnetic field perturbation @xcite breaks this g - inversion symmetry and the fermionic excitation becomes gapped .",
    "a special case with g - inversion symmetry breaking is @xmath100 , i.e. the @xmath6-wave paired state discussed by read and green in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "the @xmath101-fermion ground state wave function in the general @xmath2-wave paired state can be written down as a pfaffian for @xmath101 even : @xmath102@xmath103 where @xmath104 is the `` pair correlation '' , i.e. the fourier transform of @xmath105 in the bcs wave function @xmath106 .",
    "the wave function exhibits very different behaviors in the long wave length limit in different parameters @xcite . in the a phase , @xmath79 as @xmath107 , thus @xmath108 .",

    ", it follows that @xmath116 , leading to @xmath117 with @xmath118 and thus a weak - pairing phase . identifying @xmath119",
    ", we see that the ground state of the gapped b phase corresponds exactly to the moore - read pfaffian .",
    "it is easy to show that , @xmath120 and @xmath121 obey the same bdg equation in this general @xmath2-wave paired state , such that the anti - particle of the quasiparticle @xmath122 is itself , i.e. , it is majorana fermion obeying dirac equations in 2 + 1-dimensions @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the nature of the gapless b phase in the general model with g - inversion symmetry . in this case , @xmath123 at @xmath124 which are the solutions of @xmath125 and , say , @xmath126 . at @xmath82 ,",
    "the fermion dispersions are generally given by 2d dirac cones .",
    "however , by a continuous variation of the parameters , one can realize a dimensional reduction near the phase boundary where the effective theory is in fact a 1 + 1 dimensional conformal field theory in the long wave length limit .",
    "let us consider parameters that are close to the critical line with @xmath127 where @xmath128\\equiv{\\rm sgn}(q_x')$ ] with @xmath129 . doing the fourier transform , we find @xmath130 the @xmath131-function indicates that the pairing in the gapless b phase has a one - dimensional character and the ground state is a one - dimensional moore - read pfaffian .",
    "the bdg equations reduce to @xmath132 with @xmath133 .",
    "thus , the gapless bogoliubov quasiparticles are one - dimensional majorana fermions .",
    "the long wave length effective theory for the gapless b phase near the phase boundary is therefore the massless majorana fermion theory in 1 + 1-dimensional space - time , i.e. a @xmath4 conformal field theory or equivalently a two - dimensional ising model .",
    "we note that there is no spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry associated with the phase transition from a to b phases .",
    "kitaev has shown that the a phase in his model is topologically trivial and has zero spectral chern number , while the gapped b phase is characterized by the chern number @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "this fact was already discussed by read and green in the context of @xmath6 paired state . here",
    "we follow read and green @xcite to study the topological invariant in a general @xmath2-wave state .    in continuum limit , @xmath135 lives in an euclidean space @xmath136 .",
    "however , the constraint @xmath137 parameterizes a sphere @xmath138 . as @xmath139 , @xmath140 such that @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , we can compactify @xmath136 into an @xmath138 by adding @xmath142 to @xmath136 where @xmath141",
    ". the sphere @xmath143 can also be parameterized by a pseudospin vector @xmath144 because @xmath145 .",
    "@xmath146 thus describes a mapping from @xmath147 to @xmath138 ( spinor @xmath148 ) .",
    "the winding number of the mapping is a topological invariant.the north pole is @xmath149 at @xmath150 and the south pole is @xmath151 at @xmath152 . in the @xmath153 parametrization ,",
    "@xmath154 at @xmath150 and @xmath155 at @xmath156 , corresponding to either the north pole or south pole .    in the strong pairing phase , we know that @xmath157 and @xmath158 as @xmath159 ( or equivalently , @xmath160 ) .",
    "this means that for arbitrary @xmath161 , @xmath146 maps the @xmath2-sphere to the upper hemisphere and the winding number is zero .",
    "that is , the topological number @xmath162 in the strong pairing phase .    in the weak paring phase , @xmath163 and @xmath164 as @xmath159",
    "this means that the winding number is nonzero ( at least wrapping once ) . for our case ,",
    "the winding number can be directly calculated and is given by @xmath165 defining @xmath166 , which is the fourier component of the projection operator to the negative spectral space of the hamiltonian , this winding number can be identified as the spectral chern number defined by kitaev @xcite @xmath167dp_xdp_y\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath168 is a projective operator .",
    "this spectral chern number vanishes in the strong pairing a phase but takes an integer value in the weak paring b phase .",
    "thus , the phase transition from a to b is a topological phase transition .",
    "we have discussed the universal behaviors of the ground state .",
    "we now turn to discuss the @xmath27 vortex excitation in the spin model which corresponds to setting @xmath33 for a given plaquette .",
    "the hamiltonian in the majorana fermion representation is bilinear and the energies of the vortices can be estimated both in the a phase @xcite and the b phase@xcite .",
    "however , it remained difficult to obtain analytical solutions of the wave functions with two well - separated vortices .",
    "we have shown that the ground state sector is equivalent to the @xmath6 pairing theory for fermions on the square lattice .",
    "therefore , the pfaffian state is the ground state wave function in the continuum limit in the weak pairing phase .",
    "our strategy is to evaluate the energy of the trial wave function containing vortices above the pfaffian state in the continuum limit . for two",
    "well separated half - vortices located at @xmath169 and @xmath170 shown in fig .",
    "1 ( lower panel ) , the moore - read trial wave function has been well - studied @xcite and is given by @xmath171 the second quantized state corresponding to this wave function reads @xmath172 performing a fourier transformation , we have @xmath173 where @xmath174 and @xmath175 are the relative and the total momenta of the pairs and @xmath176 is the fourier transform of @xmath177 .",
    "one can show that , @xmath178 where @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 are positive constants and @xmath182 is independent of @xmath183 .",
    "thus , @xmath184 such a vortex pair is shown in fig .  1 where the red @xmath15-links have @xmath185 and all others have @xmath186 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian can be written as @xmath187 , where @xmath55 is the vortex - free hamiltonian and @xmath188 is the vortex part .",
    "the latter is expressed as a sum of the pairing and chemical potential terms according to eq .",
    "( 5 ) over the red @xmath15-links extending in the @xmath189-direction ( i.e. , the direction with @xmath190 ) between the vortices .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath188 has the following expectation value in the vortex state , @xmath191 where @xmath192 is an analytical function of @xmath193 .",
    "_ this means that there are no a continuum spectrum above the vortex pairs and then the vortex pairs are also separated from other higher energy excitations .",
    "_ on the other hand , one can check that since @xmath194=0 $ ] , the @xmath195 sector does not play a nontrivial role in calculating the energy @xmath196 of such a vortex pair .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath197 where @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "physically , the factor @xmath200 in eq.(15 ) is the quasihole distribution when the two vortices are located at @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "thus , @xmath196 indeed corresponds to the energy cost to excite the vortex pair .",
    "we have evaluated the vortex pair energy @xmath196 in different limits .",
    "first , if @xmath169 and @xmath170 were sent to infinity before @xmath201 , then @xmath202 and we recover the ground state .",
    "second , if @xmath201 while @xmath169 and @xmath170 remain finite , then @xmath203 , which tends to @xmath204 in both the small and large @xmath205 limits .",
    "the excitation energy is thus high but finite due to the short distance cut - off .",
    "( recall that @xmath206 in the b phase ) .",
    "it is independent of @xmath169 and @xmath170 and as a result the vortices are deconfined .",
    "the third case is when the vortices are far from the origin such that @xmath207 and @xmath208 are finite . in the short distance , large @xmath205 limit , @xmath209 . on the other hand , in the long wavelength limit with @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 constant such that @xmath214 . as a result , the vortex pair energy @xmath196 is free of infrared divergences and is only weakly dependent on @xmath215",
    ". therefore , the vortices are also deconfined .",
    "finally , since @xmath216 increases with the paring parameters @xmath217 and @xmath218 in eq.(4 ) , @xmath196 is expected to increase with increasing paring gap parameters .",
    "these results are consistent with the finite size numerical calculations of the vortex pair energy in the lattice model @xcite .",
    "our analytical results suggest that the vortex pair described by eq.(11 ) , while costing a high energy in the bulk , corresponds to low energy excitations near the edge of the system .",
    "we note an important difference between this @xmath2-wave theory and a conventional @xmath2-wave superfluid : instead of spontaneously breaking the @xmath219 symmetry in an usual @xmath2-wave superfluid , only the discrete @xmath27 symmetry is broken and the @xmath219 symmetry is absent in the present model .",
    "the vortices studied here are thus @xmath27 vortices instead of @xmath219 vortices . as a consequence , in the gapped b phase , the vortices are in the deconfinement phase @xcite instead of being logarithmically confined in the @xmath2-wave superfluid .",
    "this fact can be easily seen because @xmath220 are real and there is no @xmath219 phase factor whose gradient gives rise to a vector field of the vortex .",
    "our analysis of the vortex pair energy also shows this difference .",
    "the finiteness of @xmath196 and the vanishing of @xmath221 imply that the vortex excitations are _ separated _ either from the ground state or other excitations .",
    "this is consistent with analysis of read and green on the u(1 ) vortex excitations in the @xmath2-wave paired state @xcite . to determine how close the moore - read vortex state is to the exact vortex excitations in this model requires a numerical calculation of the overlapping between the exact eigenstates and the moore - read vortex wave functions .",
    "a more important question is the realization of the read - moore four - vortex state which has a two - fold degeneracy with the vortices obeying non - abelian statistics @xcite .",
