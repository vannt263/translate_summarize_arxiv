    "the double layered cmr manganite materials , la@xmath4sr@xmath5mn@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , demonstrate magnetic behaviour that is distinct from the perovskite manganites , la@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath8 , including : ( i ) strong anisotropy of electrical ( magneto- ) transport @xcite ; ( ii ) nearly 2d character of its magnetism and strong afm magnetic correlations above t@xmath9 @xcite ; and ( iii ) anomalous magnetoelastic properties @xcite .",
    "most experimental reports on the layered manganites have concentrated on the la@xmath4sr@xmath5mn@xmath0o@xmath1 compounds with @xmath10 , which are metallic and demonstrate strong magnetoresistive effects .",
    "stochiometric lasr@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 ( x=0.5 ) exhibits interesting spin , charge and orbital ordering , and its resistivity is of the order of @xmath11 with a rather flat temperature dependence @xcite .",
    "this can be compared with the situation in perovskite manganites where undoped lamno@xmath8 is an antiferromagnetic insulator with strong orbital ordering and la@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath8 with @xmath10 is a metal with strong magnetoresistive effects @xcite .    in comparison with the pseudocubic perovskites with three - dimensional networks of mno@xmath12 octahedra ( i.e. , ( la , sr)mno@xmath8 ) , these layered structures + ( la , sr)@xmath8mn@xmath0o@xmath1 have a reduced exchange coupling between the mn ions along the _ c _ direction .",
    "indeed , the pseudo - cubic perovskites show ferromagnetism and metallic conductivity over a wide range of hole doping , suggesting that the double - exchange mechanism is dominant among itinerant _ e@xmath13 _ electrons . in the double - layered case , with the two - dimensional mn - o network , consisting of two perovskite blocks separated by an intervening insulating layer of ( la , sr)o ions along the _ c _ axis , the balance between antiferromagnetism and ferromagnetism is very sensitive to @xmath2 band filling @xcite .",
    "bilayer la@xmath4sr@xmath5mn@xmath0o@xmath1 demonstrates ferromagnetism in a doping range @xmath14 , a canted antiferromagnetic structure for a hole concentration @xmath15 , and layered antiferromagnetic states for @xmath16 @xcite .    from experimental data @xcite",
    ", it is known that the ground state spin structure of lasr@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 phase is a - type layered antiferromagnet ( afm ) , where the magnetic moments lie in the @xmath17 plane and couple ferromagnetically within the single mno@xmath0 layer , but show afm order between the respective mno@xmath0 layers within the bilayer unit .",
    "the interlayer coupling in the bilayer stack is ferromagnetic .",
    "one of the most striking properties of the bilayered lasr@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 is the competition between the ( charge - disordered ) a - type afm spin ordering with a nel temperature t@xmath18170 k and the ce - type @xcite charge / orbital ordering which exists between @xmath19 and t@xmath20=210 k @xcite .",
    "with decreasing temperature , the development of the charge / orbital ordering phase is disrupted by the onset of the a - type afm ordering at t@xmath21  which may be qualitatively explained by the onset of ferromagnetic order in each @xmath17 plane .",
    "an important issue in the theory of cmr oxides is the role of coulomb correlation .",
    "an accurate treatment of correlation may significantly affect the balance between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions and hence the magnetic ground state .",
    "lda band structure calculations for cmr perovskites demonstrated the possibility of lda theory predicting the correct magnetic ground state @xcite .",
    "for the double layered perovskites , an investigation of the reliability of this theory has not yet been performed . in their report on the electronic structure calculations of lasr@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 within the general gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite , boer and",
    "de groot suggested to take into account some additional correlation corrections to obtain a truly half - metallic electronic structure in the layered manganites .",
    "there is one report of an lda+u calculation @xcite performed for the doping level of 0.4 holes per mn site ( la@xmath22sr@xmath23mn@xmath0o@xmath1 ) , but details of their calculation have not been presented and the important question of how correlations affect the magnetic ground state has not been investigated .",
    "the purpose of our work is to study the electronic structure which governs the microscopic origin of the magnetic phenomena in the bilayered manganite , and to determine its dependence on coulomb correlations and its relation with magnetic properties .",
    "we consider the difference in the total energies , exchange interaction parameters , the population of mn - d and o - p states near the fermi level and d sub - band widths for ferromagnetic ( fm ) and a - type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) configurations as a function of the coulomb correlation parameter u and give a simple interpretation of exchange coupling between mn layers in lasr@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 within the double exchange model .",
    "in contrast to the case of lamno@xmath8 , we find that the inclusion of u in lasr@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 results in important differences in the @xmath2-band characteristics that are responsible for the observed fm instability and for strong anisotropy in the electrical transport .",
    "the lsda and lsda+u calculations were realized in the frame - work of the linear - muffin - tin - orbital method in the atomic sphere approximation ( lmto - asa ) @xcite .",
    "we used the von barth - hedin - janak form @xcite for exchange - correlation potential .",
    "the crystal parameters were taken from ref .",
    "the atomic sphere radii were : r(la(sr))=3.4 a.u .",
    ", r(mn)=2.8 a.u . , and r(o)=2.2 a.u . from the constrained lsda supercell calculations",
    "@xcite , we obtained values of the coulomb and exchange parameters to be u=7.2 ev and j=0.78 ev .",
    "these values are typical for the transition - metal oxides @xcite .",
    "as a first step , we calculated the electronic structure of fm ( all atoms in every layer and between layers are ordered ferromagnetically ) and a - type afm ( ferromagnetic layers stacked antiferromagnetically ) lasr@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 by the standard lsda method ( u=0 ) .",
    "the total and projected densities of states ( dos ) for these cases are shown in fig .",
    "1 . for the majority - spin channel ( solid line ) , mn 3d states",
    "form the bands between 2.2 ev below e@xmath24 and 2.5 ev above e@xmath24 .",
    "as seen from the figure , the @xmath2 ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) bands are partially filled , cross e@xmath24 , and are rather broad compared to the @xmath27 ( @xmath28 and degenerate @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) bands which are about 1.2 ev wide and lie 1 ev below e@xmath24 .",
    "the exchange interaction splits the mn 3d states such that the @xmath27 and @xmath2 minority - spin bands are located 2.6 ev higher in energy than the majority - spin states .",
    "we obtained a band gap of 2.5 ev in the minority - spin @xmath31 bands and a band structure that is in a very good agreement with that obtained by the full - potential lmto method @xcite ( but their band gap within the minority spin channel is about 1.7 - 1.9 ev ) .",
    "our results for the ferromagnetic state with u=0 differ from the results of dessau _ et al _ @xcite where a u of 2 ev was used to obtain a gap at e@xmath24 in the minority - spin bands for la@xmath22sr@xmath23mn@xmath0o@xmath1",
    ". it should be noted , that the fermi level in our calculations was found to lie at the bottom of the @xmath27 minority conduction band ( as in the flmto calculation @xcite ) , so the electronic structure just misses to being a half - metallic one .    in order to investigate the role of on - site coulomb correlation",
    ", we calculated the electronic structures of lasr@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 for both fm and a - type afm orderings using a number of values of u , namely 2 , 4 , 6 , 7.2 , 8 , 9 and 10 ev .",
    "the total and projected dos s of the fm and afm cases with u=7.2 ev are shown in fig .",
    "2 . only majority @xmath2 states make a significant contribution to the dos at e@xmath24 . for u=0 , one can expect three - dimensional conduction in both spin channels ( fig .",
    "1 ) , while for u@xmath320 we obtain a half - metallic state  electron conduction is possible only within majority spin sublattice .",
    "we want to emphasize here analogues in the main band characteristics near e@xmath24 in the calculated electronic spectra of double layered and doped perovskite manganites @xcite . and",
    "since doped perovskite manganites are found to be half - metallic @xcite , this may also be the case for the double - layered manganite .      to investigate the variation ( behavior ) of the electrically active states as a function of on - site coulomb correlation , we plot in fig .",
    "3 the dependence on u of the @xmath26 and @xmath25 states contribution to the dos at e@xmath24 ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) and to the number of states integrated in a small energy window of 0.3 ev just above e@xmath24 ( denoted as n@xmath33 and n@xmath34 in fig .",
    "the difference between fm and afm phases for a particular u value is clearly seen from fig .",
    "3(a ) . for the fm phase ( dotted lines ) , both contributions of the @xmath26 ( circles ) and @xmath25 ( crosses ) states decrease with u in almost the same way , and only large u values ( u@xmath327 ev ) result in a splitting of the @xmath2 states .",
    "the most significant changes occur for afm spin alignment ( solid lines ) .",
    "the @xmath2 states are already split in the lsda calculation ( u=0 ) and the difference between the electron population of @xmath26 and @xmath25 orbitals is clearly seen ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) . further , while the contribution of the @xmath25 state to the dos at e@xmath24 does not change with an increase of u , the @xmath35 contribution , which is almost two times bigger than that of @xmath36 for u=0 , drastically decreases with u , taking its minimum for u@xmath327 ev .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "3(b ) , the situation does not change qualitativly in the energy window just above e@xmath24 , encouraging us to draw the following conclusions : for small u values we have 3d conduction , while for u@xmath326 the electron conduction ( hopping ) along the @xmath37 axis becomes very small .",
    "thus , on - site correlation treated within lsda+u promotes 2d type ( in - plane ) electronic behavior in the system .",
    "we need to add here that the significant difference between @xmath26 and @xmath25 states ( due to an decrease of the band width as well as a shift to higher energy of the @xmath26 state with increase of u ) is an essential feature of lasr@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "it sets the double layered manganite apart from perovskite manganites ( i.e. , ( la , sr)mno@xmath8 ) in which the main energy characteristics such as widths and centers of both @xmath2 bands are very close .    the anisotropy in the population of the two @xmath2 states established above can be illustrated more clearly in the plot of the angular distribution of the electron density in the 0.3 ev energy window above e@xmath24 for u=0 and for the calculated value , u=7 ev ( c.f . ,",
    "a comparison of the lowest spin configurations ( fm for u=0 ( fig .",
    "4(a ) ) and afm for u=7 ev ( fig .",
    "4(d ) ) as obtained from total energy differences ) shows that both on - site correlation and change in spin ordering significantly decrease the number of electrons that contribute to electrical transport along the @xmath37 axis .",
    "this is contrary to the in - plane state which remain less sensitive to the spin alignment change and influence of u. ( note , however , that only on - site correlation supresses the minority @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) state contribution to the electron density above e@xmath24 , resulting in a half - metallic state , as mentioned above . )",
    "the decisive role of the on - site coulomb correlation in lowering the dimensionality of the conduction band is clearly seen from a comparison of two afm cases with u=0 and u=7 ev ( fig .",
    "4(b ) and 4(d ) ) : for u=7 ev , only the @xmath25 orbital has some contribution just above e@xmath24 and hopping along the @xmath37 axis is negligible ( the @xmath26 state is responsible for it ) .",
    "this is consistent with the point that the main issue for realizing the layered afm state is the strong anisotropy in the population of the two - dimensional @xmath38 state and the one - dimensional @xmath39 state . for the fm state",
    ", the orbital configurations have more electron population freedom , because three crystallographic axes are equivalent .",
    "qualitatively this situation does not change as u increases . according to the qualitative picture of the simple double exchange model , an electrically active electron has a finite hopping probability ( t ) between ferromagnetically ordered mn ions , but this hopping vanishes in the case of antiferromagnetic spin alignment due to strong hund coupling ( t@xmath40j ) .",
    "figure 4(b ) clearly shows the failure of the lsda sheme .",
    "thus , taking into account on - site coloumb correlation gives us the correct picture of 2d - like charge transport in the layered manganite : the increase of u suppresses the @xmath37 axis transport , keeping electron conduction in the @xmath17 plane .",
    "however , it should be noted that the transition from fm to afm ordering ( fig .",
    "4(c ) and 4(d ) ) also contributes to this tendency , but to a lesser degree than on - site correlation  as can be seen from a comparison of fig .",
    "4(a ) and 4(d ) .      to investigate how the magnetic interaction and ground state depend on u , we calculated total energy differences for u=0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 7.2 , 8 , 9 and 10 ev .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) , where the total energy of the fm spin ordering for each value of u is taken to be zero .",
    "although the difference of the two calculated spin alignments is @xmath41 0.1 ev for all cases ( and so we have almost degenerate magnetic states ) , for u=0 , u=2 and u=4 ev the fm ordering is preferred , while for u=6 , 7.2 , 8 , 9 and 10 ev the afm phase has lower energy .",
    "thus , the on - site mn - d electron coulomb correlations modify the magnetic ordering from fm to a - type afm  as experimentally observed . note , that the total energy difference between fm and afm states does not change for u @xmath3 8 ev .",
    "to determine the character of the exchange coupling in the layered manganite and to understand why the experimentally observed a - type afm spin ordering is simulated only with u@xmath327 ev , we also calculated the effective exchange interaction parameters ( for computational details see @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "5(b ) , the values of the d - d effective exchange parameters , @xmath42 , between nearest mn neighbours which belong to the different layers of one bilayer are shown as a function of u. they are seen to follow the behavior of the total energy differences shown in fig .",
    "usually , the exchange coupling is described within the superexchange ( sex ) and double exchange ( dex ) models and corresponding solutions of the simple hamiltonian problem with the following parameters : hopping between mn ions ( t ) , j ( dex model ) ; and t , u ( sex model ) . to provide interpretation to this model",
    ", we plot the @xmath2-sub - band widths of the fm phase for a number of u values in fig .",
    "5(c ) ( denoted as w@xmath33 and w@xmath34 below ) .",
    "as can be seen , the @xmath25 band width almost does not change its value with u , and the main differences in the electronic spectra due to an increase of u are connected with the @xmath26 state .",
    "the decrease of the difference between the w@xmath33 and w@xmath34 band widths from u=0 up to u@xmath435 ev in fig .",
    "5(c ) , coming from the increase of w@xmath33 , promotes the dex interactions mediated by itinerant electrons , fig .",
    "further , the positive ( fm ) contribution to the exchange interaction changes its sign at about u=7 ev , where a sharp decrease of the w@xmath33 value for the fm phase occurs .",
    "in addition , due to a redistribution of the electron density between states , w@xmath34 increases slightly , and so the splitting of these two @xmath2-sub - bands increases . thus , coulomb correlations supress the dex contributions to the interlayer exchange interaction energy , and we believe that the sharp @xmath26 band width narrowing in the range of 6@xmath44u@xmath447 ev is responsible for the fm instability , and hence , is the mechanism that produces the change in magnetic ordering . in addition , this splitting of the @xmath2 states promotes strong anisotropy in the electrical transport , as described above .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the electronic structure of double layered + lasr@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 using both the lsda and lsda+u methods and have investigated the influence of the coulomb interaction parameter on both the electronic structure and the magnetic ordering .",
    "the main factors governing band formation in lasr@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 are : ( i ) the exchange splitting with almost unoccupied minority spin mn-3d states ; ( ii ) the ligand field splitting of the @xmath27 and @xmath2 states ; and ( iii ) futher splitting of the @xmath2 states with increase of u. we consider ( iii ) an essential factor in the layered manganites .",
    "we have examined fm and a - type afm ground states of this compound by comparing their total energy differences for a number of u values ( from 0 to 10 ev ) and found that the experimentally observed magnetic ordering is reproduced within lsda+u only for u@xmath37 ev - in contrast with the 3d manganites ( lamno@xmath8 ) where lsda gives the true magnetic ground state .",
    "it was shown that the correlations reduce significantly the effective hopping parameter for the electrically active @xmath2 electrons along the @xmath37 axis , so that taking into account the coloumb correlation gives the correct 2d - picture in the layered manganite .",
    "the strong anisotropy in electrical transport which we obtained is consistent with observations of anisotropic transport - a property which sets this manganite apart from conventional 3d systems .",
