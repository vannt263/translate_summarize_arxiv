    "state preparations and read outs of engineered hamiltonian that can mimic molecules are feasible using cold atoms with magneto- and optical controls @xcite . the readings of the state of the dqd molecule are often via separate mesoscopic electrometers,@xcite or alternatively by integrating the dqd with radio - frequency resonant circuits.@xcite the quantum state properties investigated with the example of artificial molecules here are readily to be examined in experiments .    the general formulation presented in this article is applicable to time - dependent hamiltonian .",
    "the time - dependence , besides arising from external fields , can also come from two - body interactions approximated by suitable mean - field treatments .",
    "the general analytical solution to exact fermion master equations should have more other potential applications to various realizations of nanoscale quantum devices .",
    "an understanding of the general behaviours of the quantum states is also helpful to the development of quantum controls .",
