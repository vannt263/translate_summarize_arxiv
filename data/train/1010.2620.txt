    "ordinary thermodynamics describing the macroscopic phenomenology of homogeneous equilibrium systems leads to the following _ stability conditions _ : @xmath0 these conditions ensure that the pressure @xmath1 of a system decreases as its volume @xmath2 increases and that the system warms up when absorbing energy at fixed volume ( positive specific heat at constant volume @xmath3 ) .",
    "one of the major achievements of mathematical physics was to show that ordinary matter , composed of a large number of electrons and protons , behave according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dp / dv<0],[eq : cv>0 ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , it has recently turned out that systems not satisfying the condition ( [ eq : cv>0 ] ) , actually exist in nature , and that a corresponding thermodynamic description should yet be possible in certain cases @xcite .",
    "the prototypical examples of such unstable systems are stars which are known to expand and cool down as their energy increases @xcite .    within the canonical ensemble",
    "the specific heat is related to the fluctuations of energy via the relation @xmath4 . from this expression",
    "it is evident that specific heat is necessarily positive in the canonical ensemble .",
    "negative specific heat , however may appear within the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "this can happen due to different mechanisms :    * the ergodic properties of the system may depend on energy .",
    "hence , at different energies , different parts of phase space are accessible .",
    "this may lead to negative specific heat and other thermodynamical anomalies .",
    "an example was given by hertel and thirring @xcite .",
    "* the system might be far from the thermodynamic limit .",
    "systems that are stable in the thermodynamic limit , such as lennard - jones gases , may display negative specific if only their size is small enough @xcite . *",
    "long ranged forces might prevent the thermodynamic limit to exist at all .",
    "but even when an equilibrium state exists such systems remain _ nonextensive _ and may show negative specific heat @xcite .    in this work we will present yet another mechanism that leads to negative specific heat and other thermodynamic anomalies for systems in _ contact _ with a _ heat bath_. apart from extensivity and short ranged interactions , another assumption is customarily made in the statistical mechanics of canonical systems , namely _ weak coupling _ between system and its environment . when the coupling to the environment is not negligible , violations of condition ( [ eq : cv>0 ] ) may appear even if system and environment , as a whole , are in a canonical state @xcite .",
    "hence , yet another item can be added to our list of exceptions :    * systems that strongly interact with their environment may display thermodynamic anomalies    for example , a single free particle , which would display a positive specific heat when weakly coupled to a bath , may display negative specific heat when in strong interaction with the bath @xcite .",
    "similar effects were observed for a two level system coupled to a harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "we assume that the total system @xmath5 , is in _ weak _ contact with a _ super - bath _ that provides the temperature concept ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 is boltzmann constant . )",

    "however , if the coupling between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is non - negligible , the overall canonical state does not factorize into the product of two canonical states for @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively : @xmath13 .",
    "although the system is in perfect thermal equilibrium with its environment , it is not in a canonical state and therefore negative entropies and violations of the inequalities ( [ eq : dp / dv<0],[eq : cv>0 ] ) may occur .",
    "these violations though are not a sign of any instability because as a part of a stable total system , the system of interest itself is also stable .",
