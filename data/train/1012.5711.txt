    "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) astrometry is an important method to measure the structure of the milky way galaxy ( mwg ) . by measuring the accurate position of the source and its time variation ,",
    "the source distance and proper motion could be determined directly .",
    "vlbi astrometry at 10 @xmath5as accuracy of the galactic h@xmath0o and ch@xmath6oh maser sources with vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) and very long baseline array ( vlba ) determined accurate distances at kpc - scale with the errors less than 10% ( see for example @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the galactic constants , the distance from sun to the galactic center ( @xmath7 ) and the galactic rotation velocity at sun ( @xmath8 ) are major parameters to study the structure of the mwg .",
    "the rotation curve of the mwg and all kinematic distances of the sources in the mwg are based directly on the galactic constants .",
    "although international astronomical union ( iau ) has recommended to give the values of @xmath9 kpc and @xmath10 km s@xmath4 since 1985 , numerous recent studies report the values different from them ( e.g. @xcite ) .    however , observational estimation of the galactic constants is difficult .",
    "this is because the observational estimation of galactic constants is affected by several independent assumptions ; the peculiar motion of the source , systemic non - circular motions of both the source and the lsr due to the spiral arm and the non - axisymmetric potential of the mwg , and relative motion of sun to the lsr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . to minimize these effects",
    ", we should observe many sources located at various positions in the mwg .",
    "the tangent point that the vector of the source galactic rotation is parallel to the line of sight is a kinematically unique position in the mwg . in the case that the source is located at this point and on the pure circular rotation , the proper motion of the source depends only on the galactic rotation of sun , @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , we can estimate @xmath8 from the measured proper motion .",
    "we can also estimate @xmath7 from the measured source distance , since the tangent point , sun , and the galactic center make the right triangle .",
    "@xcite measured the parallactic distance of w51 main / south which is located near the tangent point , and estimated @xmath11 kpc using this simple geometry . even if the source is not located at the tangent point , but near there , we can estimate the ratio of galactic constants , @xmath12 , the angular velocity of the galactic rotation at sun , @xmath13 , as described in section 4 .",
    "the value of this ratio is a constraint to estimate one of the galactic constants from the other .",
    "although the iau gives recommended values of the galactic constants , at least one of them should be revised , if the ratio is inconsistent to the observed value .",
    "the radial velocity of the source located at the tangent point is equal to the terminal velocity .",
    "it is defined as the extreme velocity on any line of sight at @xmath14 , and described as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the galactic rotation velocity of the source .",
    "therefore , we selected the sources whose radial velocities are close to the terminal velocity .",
    "one of these sources , onsala 1 ( on1 ) is a massive star - forming region located at the galactic coordinate of @xmath17 .",
    "the radial velocity of on1 is close to the terminal velocity .",
    "the radial velocity observed in molecular lines is @xmath18 km s@xmath4 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the terminal velocity at @xmath19 is derived to be 14 km s@xmath4 from the iau recommended value of @xmath10 km s@xmath4 and assuming the flat rotation ( @xmath20 ) , and is @xmath21 km s@xmath4 in the @xmath22-@xmath23 diagram of @xcite .",
    "the distance of on1 is measured to be @xmath24 kpc by the 6.7 ghz ch@xmath6oh maser astrometry with the evn ( @xcite ) .",
    "vlbi maps of the h@xmath0o masers have been reported by @xcite .",
    "they found that on1 has two clusters of h@xmath0o masers ( wmc1 and wmc2 ) separated by .    in the present study",
    ", we report on our successful determination of the parallax of on1 with vera .",
    "this is a first step to estimate the galactic constants and the angular velocity of the galactic rotation at sun using vera .",
    "we observed h@xmath0o masers in the star - forming region on1 with vera at 11 epochs spanned about two years .",
    "the epochs are day of year ( doy ) 245 , 256 , 290 , 309 , 360 in 2006 , 046 , 091 , 129 , 223 in 2007 , 020 , and 202 in 2008 . at each epoch , the h@xmath0o @xmath25-@xmath26 maser at a rest frequency of 22.235080 ghz in on1 and a position reference source j2010 + 3322 were simultaneously observed in a dual - beam mode for about 10 hours .",
    "the typical on - source integration time was 6 hours for both on1 and j2010 + 3322 .",
    "j2010 + 3322 is listed in vlba calibrator survey 2 ( vcs2 : @xcite ) .",

    "the separation angle between on1 and j2010 + 3322 is .",
    "the instrumental phase difference between the two beams was measured continuously during the observations by injecting artificial noise sources into both beams ( @xcite ) .",
    "left - hand circular polarization signals were sampled with 2-bit quantization , and filtered with the vera digital filter unit ( @xcite ) .",
    "the data were recorded onto magnetic tapes at a rate of 1024 mbps , providing a total bandwidth of 256 mhz , which consists of @xmath27 mhz if channels .",
    "one if channel was assigned to on1 , and the other 15 if channels were assigned to j2010 + 3322 , respectively .",
    "correlation processing was carried out on the mitaka fx correlator .",
    "the frequency and velocity resolutions for on1 were 31.25 khz and 0.42 km s@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "data reduction was conducted using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "an amplitude calibration was performed using the system noise temperatures during the observations . for phase - referencing",
    ", a fringe fitting was made using the aips task fring on j2010 + 3322 with a typical integration time of 2 min .",
    "the solutions of the fringe phases , group delays , and delay rates were obtained every 30 sec .",
    "these solutions were applied to the data of on1 in order to calibrate the visibility data .",
    "phase and amplitude solutions obtained from self - calibration of j2010 + 3322 were also applied to on1 .",
    "visibility phase errors caused by the earth s atmosphere were calibrated based on gps measurements of the atmospheric zenith delay which occurs due to tropospheric water vapor ( @xcite ) . after the calibration , we made spectral - line image cubes using the aips task imagr around masers with @xmath28 pixels of size 0.05 milliarcsecond ( mas ) .",
    "the typical size of the synthesized beam was @xmath29 mas with position angle of .",
    "the rms noises for each images were approximately 0.11 jy beam@xmath4 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of 7 was adopted as the detection criterion .    in the single - beam vlbi imaging of on1 ( without phase - referencing to the j2010 + 3322 in the other beam ) , group delays solved on j2025 + 3343 in the same beam were applied .",
    "the fringe fitting was done using one of the brightest emissions at lsr velocity of 14.9 km s@xmath4 in on1 , and the solutions are applied to all velocity channels .",
    "the data reductions for single - beam imaging are the same method with previous jvn observations of on1 ( @xcite ) .",

    "they are obtained with the mizusawa - iriki baseline , and averaged for the total observational time .",
    "there are low - velocity components ( @xmath30 to 17 km s@xmath4 ) near the systemic velocity of on1 ( @xmath31 km s@xmath4 ; @xcite ) , and high - velocity blue - shifted ( @xmath32 to @xmath33 km s@xmath4 ) and red - shifted ( @xmath34 to 70 km s@xmath4 ) components .",
    "the most of the low - velocity components are detected over one year .",
    "the high - velocity components are time - variable and not persistent for more than half a year .",
    "we detected 28 h@xmath0o maser features for more than two epochs .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows the distributions and internal motions of these features .",
    "the masers are distributed with approximately @xmath35 area , which is consistent with the previous vlbi observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the difference between the present and previous observations is the difference in time intervals of the epochs . by observing with the shorter time intervals of 12 months ,",
    "the number of the maser features which we can trace the internal motions in the present observations increased to the twice of the previous ones .",
    "on1 has two clusters of h@xmath0o maser features located at @xmath36 and ( , ) .",
    "they are named as wmc1 and wmc2 by @xcite , respectively .",
    "the internal motions of wmc1 exhibit a bipolar outflow structure in the east - west direction .",
    "the blue- and red - shifted features show the high expansion velocity of @xmath37 70 km s@xmath4 in three - dimensional velocity .",
    "the low velocity features with @xmath30 to 17 km s@xmath4 show low expansion velocity of @xmath37 10 km s@xmath4 . in the previous observations ,",
    "the blue- and red - shifted features were distributed within two small regions of approximately @xmath38 mas separated by @xmath39 mas , and were not detected outside of these regions ( @xcite ) .",
    "they are two clusters of the blue - shifted features around @xmath40 mas and the red - shifted features around @xmath41 mas in figure [ fig:2](b ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that a driving source of h@xmath0o masers is located near the midpoint of these two clusters .",
    "however , we detected a new red - shifted feature at @xmath42 mas .",
    "therefore , the driving source would be located between the cluster of blue - shifted features and a new red - shifted feature . in wmc2 , only the low velocity features ( @xmath43 to 14 km s@xmath4 ) are detected .",
    "their internal motions did not show a systematic , and thus masers in wmc2 are not likely to originate from wmc1 .",
    "we confirmed that there are two driving sources of h@xmath0o masers in on1 .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)./fig1.eps    ( 120mm,120mm)./fig2.eps      absolute motions of h@xmath0o masers to the extragalactic position reference source are expressed by the sum of a linear motion and the trigonometric parallax .",
    "we conducted monitoring observations of h@xmath0o masers for about two years , and their absolute motions were successfully obtained by referencing to the position reference source , j2010 + 3322 .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows positional variations of one of the brightest maser feature at @xmath44 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the positional variations show systematic sinusoidal modulation with a period of one year caused by the parallax .    in order to obtain the parallax and proper motion",
    ", we use the positions of ten maser features detected over half a year .",
    "we conducted a combined parallax fit , in which the positions of ten features are fitted simultaneously with one common parallax but different proper motions and position offsets for each spot . for this fit",
    ", we used errors of 0.057 and 0.082 mas in right ascension and declination , respectively , in quadrature to the formal fitting errors .",
    "this resulted in @xmath45 per degree of freedom values of unity for both the right ascension and declination data .",
    "the resulting parallax is @xmath46 mas .",
    "table [ tab:1 ] shows the results of the combined parallax fit .    to confirm the consistency of the parallax motion for each maser feature",
    ", we also estimate the parallax individually . in table",
    "[ tab:1 ] , we also show the obtained parallaxes using individual fitting for each maser feature .",
    "the obtained parallaxes of ten maser features are consistent with each other , from 0.382 to 0.428 mas , and give the similar result of @xmath46 mas .",
    "combining the results of ten maser features can lead to underestimation of the parallax uncertainty , in the case that the measurements are correlated among different maser features .",
    "random - like errors such as map noise and maser feature structure variation would not be correlated among different maser features . however",
    ", systemic errors ( e.g. from the correlator model or the atmosphere ) would affect all maser features in one epoch in a very similar way .",
    "the conservative approach would be that the uncertainty is not reduced when the combined fitting of ten maser features are made . in this approach",
    ", the uncertainty would be estimated to be 0.021 mas from the smallest uncertainty of i d 3 maser feature .",
    "however , the results of ten maser features are not entirely correlated , since the obtained parallaxes from individual fitting are not completely the same value .",
    "therefore , we estimate the final uncertainty of the parallax by taking the middle between the uncertainties of 0.012 and 0.021 mas , and obtain @xmath47 mas , which we adopt for the parallax of on1 .",
    "the obtained parallax corresponds to a source distance of @xmath2 kpc .",
    "this distance is consistent with the 6.7 ghz ch@xmath6oh maser parallax corresponding to @xmath24 kpc measured by @xcite , but it is obtained with 2 times higher accuracy .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows the position of on1 in the mwg which is determined from the distance of @xmath2 kpc , the longitude of @xmath48 and @xmath9 kpc .",
    "on1 is appeared to be located on the local arm and near the tangent point at @xmath19 .",
    "the absolute proper motion of a maser feature is the sum of the internal motion of the maser feature , the galactic rotation , the solar motion , and the peculiar motion of the source .",
    "all motions expect the internal motion are common to all maser features",
    ". therefore , the average of the absolute proper motions of maser features should give the systemic proper motion of the whole source , if the internal motions are randomized well .",
    "we consider that it is valid for on1 because the averaged radial velocity of ten maser features is 11.1 km s@xmath4 , and it is consistent with the systemic radial velocity derived from the associated molecular cloud ( @xmath31 km s@xmath4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the absolute proper motions of ten maser features are range from @xmath49 to @xmath50 mas yr@xmath4 in right ascension and from @xmath51 to @xmath52 mas yr@xmath4 in declination . from the average ( the arithmetic mean ) of these values the systemic proper motion of on1",
    "is derived to be @xmath53 mas yr@xmath4 , where the error is the standard error of the mean .",
    "although there is a difference of approximately 1 mas yr@xmath4 between the averaged proper motions of wmc1 and wmc2 , it would be the relative stellar motion since wmc1 and wmc2 are associated with the different sources .",
    "averaging the motions of multiple sources can also help to determine the systemic motion of on1 .",
    "we compared to the proper motion obtained by @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured the proper motions of on1 using the two background sources , j2003 + 3034 and j2009 + 3049 , and obtained the different proper motions between them because of their apparent movements .",
    "our derived systemic proper motion is close to the proper motion obtained using j2009 + 3049 .",
    "we convert the proper motion of @xmath53 mas yr@xmath4 to one with respect to lsr using the solar motion in the traditional definition of @xmath54 km s@xmath4 . in the previous studies for the astrometry of the galactic maser sources , the solar motion of @xmath55 km s@xmath4 based on the hipparcos satellite data ( @xcite )",
    "is widely used .",
    "however , @xcite suggest that the value of @xmath56 determined by @xcite is underestimated by @xmath57 km s@xmath4 , and show the value which is close to the value of the traditional definition used in this study . using the galactic coordinate of on1 @xmath17 , the proper motion with respect to lsr projected to the direction of @xmath22 and @xmath58",
    "is calculated to be @xmath59 mas yr@xmath4 .",
