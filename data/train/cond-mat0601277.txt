    "when a bulk semiconductor is simultaneously irradiated by an optical field and its phase - coherent second harmonic , quantum interference between one- and two - photon absorption pathways enables excitation of carrier distributions with interesting properties @xcite .",
    "such excitation , even without an external bias , can produce ballistic photocurrents @xcite , spin - polarized currents @xcite , and pure spin currents @xcite . characteristically of quantum interference",
    ", these currents are sensitive to the phases of the two optical fields . in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors ,",
    "the phases can also be used to control the total population of photoexcited carriers @xcite , and the net carrier spin polarization @xcite . which of these effects occur",
    "depends on the polarization states of the fields .",
    "these are examples of `` @xmath3 '' coherent control schemes , in which a two - color light field controls a physical or chemical process by interference of @xmath4- and @xmath5-photon transitions @xcite . in semiconductors ,",
    "`` 1 + 2 '' excitation has been discussed for impurity - band absorption @xcite , free carrier absorption @xcite , quantum wells @xcite , and quantum wires @xcite , but our interest here is `` 1 + 2 '' coherent control of interband transitions in unbiased bulk semiconductors @xcite .",
    "such experiments have been performed with either ( a ) two fields , typically short pulses , one the generated second harmonic of the other @xcite , or ( b ) a single ultrashort pulse having at least an octave bandwidth @xcite .",
    "previous microscopic calculations of `` 1 + 2 '' processes in bulk semiconductors fall into two categories : _ ab initio _ density functional methods have been used for current injection @xcite and population control @xcite , while simple analytical band models perturbative in @xmath2 ( with at most eight spherical , parabolic bands ) have been used for current injection @xcite and spin - current injection @xcite .",
    "the former are best suited for excess energies on the order of evs , while the latter are only valid for excitation close to the band edge and can not be applied to population and spin control , which vanish in such centrosymmetric models .    in this article , we calculate `` 1 + 2 '' processes using an intermediate model that diagonalizes the @xmath6 hamiltonian in a basis of 14 @xmath7-point states with remote band effects included perturbatively .",
    "the model contains empirically determined parameters @xcite .",
    "fourteen - band models ( also called five - level models ) have been used to calculate band structures @xcite , linear @xcite and non - linear @xcite optical properties , and spin decoherence properties @xcite of gaas and other semiconductors .",
    "winkler has recently reviewed 14-band models @xcite .",
    "the model is nonperturbative in @xmath2 and includes nonparabolicity , warping , spin - splitting , and interband spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we apply the 14-band model to the zinc - blende semiconductors insb , gasb , inp , gaas , and znse .",
    "we compare these results with analytic expressions derived in the parabolic - band approximation ( pba ) based on an expansion in @xmath2 about the @xmath7 point of @xmath8 , which is the matrix element governing optical transitions .",
    "a one - photon transition is called `` allowed '' if the zeroth - order term in its expansion is nonzero , and called `` forbidden '' otherwise .",
    "two - photon transitions have two velocity matrix elements , and thus have a hyphenated label depending on the lowest - order terms in the expansions for each matrix element . for example , if both matrix elements are independent of @xmath2 to lowest order , the two - photon transition is called `` allowed - allowed '' . for current injection and spin - current injection ,",
    "we use expressions derived previously with an eight band model @xcite . for population control and spin control ,",
    "we derive expressions with the 14-band model .",
    "the comparison between the pba expressions and the numerical calculation establishes an important microscopic difference between current and spin - current control on the one hand , and population and spin control on the other hand .",
    "close to the band - gap , the former result from the interference of allowed one - photon transitions and allowed - forbidden two - photon transitions , whereas the latter result from the interference of allowed one - photon transitions and allowed - allowed two - photon transitions .",
    "this difference was posited previously based on heuristic arguments @xcite .",
    "most of the early theory on semiconductor `` 1 + 2 '' processes processes conceptually separated the optical injection of densities and currents from the relaxation and transport of these quantities .",
    "we follow this approach , and in this article , focus on microscopic calculations of the optical injection .",
    "we note that relaxation and transport have been studied with an effective circuit model @xcite , hydrodynamic equations @xcite , boltzmann transport in the relaxation time approximation @xcite , a non - equilibrium green function formalism @xcite , and the semiconductor bloch equations @xcite .",
