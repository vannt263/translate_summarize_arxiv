    "there are several reasons why @xmath11 yang - mills ( ym ) theories are interesting in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "first of all , this reduction entails tremendous simplifications , so that many problems can be faced , and often solved , even beyond perturbation theory .",
    "we are referring to exact evaluations of vacuum to vacuum amplitudes of wilson loop operators , that , for a suitable choice of contour and in a particular limit , provide the potential between a static @xmath12 pair @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "another celebrated example is the spectrum of @xmath12 bound states in the large - n limit , when dynamical fermions are also taken into account @xcite .    in 1 + 1 dimensions ym theories without fermions",
    "are considered free theories , apart from topological effects .",
    "this feature looks apparent when choosing an axial gauge .",
    "however they exhibit severe infrared ( ir ) divergences , which need to be regularized . in ref.@xcite an explicit ir cutoff",
    "is advocated , which turns out to be uninfluent on the bound state spectrum ; a cauchy principal value ( cpv ) prescription in handling the ir singularity in the gluon propagator leads indeed to the same result @xcite . on the other hand",
    "this prescription emerges quite naturally if the theory is quantized at `` equal @xmath13 '' , namely adopting the light - front @xmath14 as quantization surface .",
    "still difficulties in performing a wick s rotation in the dynamical equations was pointed out in ref.@xcite . in order to remedy such a situation , a causal prescription for the double pole in the kernel",
    "was proposed , which is nothing but the one suggested years later by mandelstam and leibbrandt ( ml ) @xcite , when restricted to @xmath15 dimensions .",
    "this prescription follows from equal - time quantization@xcite and is mandatory in order to renormalize the theory in 1 + 3 dimensions@xcite,@xcite .    in view of the above - mentioned results and of the fact that `` pure '' ym theory does not immediately look free in feynman gauge",
    ", a test of gauge invariance was performed in ref.@xcite by calculating at @xmath16 , both in feynman and in light - cone gauge with ml prescription , a rectangular wilson loop with light - like sides , directed along the vectors @xmath17 , @xmath18 and parametrized according to the equations :    @xmath19    this contour has been considered in refs.@xcite for an analogous test of gauge invariance in 1 + 3 dimensions .",
    "its light - like character forces a minkowski treatment .    in order to perform the test ,",
    "dimensional regularization was used ; the feynman gauge option is indeed not viable at strictly 1 + 1 dimensions , as the usual free vector propagator is not a tempered distribution .",
    "the following unexpected results were obtained .",
    "the @xmath2 perturbative loop expression in @xmath20 dimensions is finite in the limit @xmath21 .",
    "the results in the two gauges coincide , as required by gauge invariance .",
    "they are function only of the area @xmath22 for any dimension @xmath23 and exhibit also a dependence on @xmath9 , the casimir constant of the adjoint representation .",
    "this dependence , when looked at in the light - cone gauge calculation , comes from non - planar diagrams with the colour factor @xmath24 , @xmath7 being the casimir constant of the fundamental representation .",
    "besides , there is a genuine contribution proportional to @xmath25 coming from the one - loop correction to the vector propagator .",
    "this is surprising at first sight , as in strictly 1 + 1 dimensions the triple vector vertex vanishes in axial gauges .",
    "what happens is that transverse degrees of freedom , although coupled with a vanishing strength at @xmath26 , produce finite contributions when matching with the self - energy loop singularity precisely at @xmath26 , eventually producing a finite result .",
    "such a phenomenon could not appear in a strictly 1 + 1 dimensional calculation , which would only lead to the ( smooth ) non - planar diagram result .",
    "we stress that this contribution is essential to get agreement with the feynman gauge calculation , in other words with gauge invariance .",
    "we notice that no ambiguity affects our light - cone gauge results , which do not involve infinities ; in addition the discrepancy can not be accounted for by a simple redefinition of the coupling , that would also , while unjustified on general grounds , turn out to be dependent on the area of the loop .    in order to make the argument complete , we recall that a calculation of the same wilson loop in strictly 1 + 1 dimension in light - cone gauge with a cpv prescription for the `` spurious '' singularity produces a vanishing contribution from non - planar graphs .",
    "only planar diagrams survive , leading to abelian - like results depending only on @xmath7 , which can be resummed to all orders in the perturbative expansion to recover the expected exponentiation of the area .",
    "this result , which is the usual one found in the literature , although quite transparent , _ does not coincide _ with the feynman gauge result in the limit @xmath21@xcite .",
    "the test can not be generalized to @xmath27 dimensions as cpv prescription is at odd with causality in this case@xcite .    in order to clarify whether there is indeed a pathology in the light - cone gauge formulation with ml prescription in strictly 1 + 1 dimensions",
    ", one can try to study the potential @xmath28 between a  static \" @xmath29 pair in the fundamental representation , separated by a distance @xmath0 .",
    "then a different wilson loop is to be considered , _ viz _ a rectangular loop with one side along the space direction and one side along the time direction , of length @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "eventually the limit @xmath6 at fixed @xmath30 is to be taken : the potential @xmath28 between the quark and the antiquark is indeed related to the value of the corresponding wilson loop amplitude @xmath31 through the abelian - like time exponentiation ( alte ) formula @xcite @xmath32 we remark that this condition is stronger than requiring @xcite @xmath33 which , for instance , allows @xmath34-dependent polynomials factors .",
    "the crucial point to notice in eq.([potential ] ) is that dependence on the casimir constant @xmath9 should cancel at the leading order when @xmath35 in any coefficient of a perturbative expansion of the potential with respect to coupling constant .",
    "this criterion has often been used as a check of gauge invariance@xcite .",
    "the study of this wilson loop in strictly 1 + 1 dimensions has been performed in light - cone gauge@xcite . in the cpv case , due to its essentially abelian nature",
    ", the loop can be exactly evaluated and a simple exponentiation of the area is recovered , thus providing a linear potential between the quark and the antiquark .",
    "in particular only the casimir constant @xmath7 appears .",
    "the corresponding calculation in the ml case develops genuine non - abelian terms proportional to @xmath9 ; thus , contrary to the previous case , the loop interaction feels the non - abelian nature of the theory .",
    "the loop still depends only on the area , but alte is lost : in the limit @xmath6 a dependence on @xmath9 survives @xcite,@xcite .    although alte can be proven only introducing the `` true spectrum '' of the theory , which is beyond the perturbative regime , we feel somehow uneasy with this conclusion , which is at variance with all the previous tests of gauge invariance considered in the literature .",
    "we are thereby led to consider this phenomenon as a peculiarity of strictly two - dimensional theories , which occurs when topological excitations are disregarded as in perturbative loop calculations .",
    "then the interest arises in performing the same wilson loop calculation in dimensions @xmath4 . it",
    "may indeed happen that the limits @xmath35 and @xmath21 do not commute .",
    "the main result of this paper , namely that , in the large @xmath34-limit when @xmath4 , the perturbative @xmath2 contribution is in agreement with alte , supports the conclusion above .",
    "owing to the very heavy character of the calculation , we choose to work in feynman gauge .",
    "in sect.2 we review basic concepts and notation .",
    "we also compute the wilson loop at @xmath36 .",
    "in sect.3 the relevant diagrams at @xmath2 are computed in @xmath37 dimensions , after collecting them in three basic families , the `` exchange '' diagrams , the `` self - energy '' and the `` spider '' ones , namely those involving the triple vector vertex . for @xmath4",
    "the loop depends , besides on the area , also on the ratio @xmath38 .",
    "as we are eventually interested in the large-@xmath34 behavior , we shall always consider the region @xmath39 ; moreover we shall choose @xmath40 , with a small , positive @xmath41 sect.4 contains our conclusions . in it",
    "we show that , when @xmath4 , agreement with alte occurs in the limit @xmath35 , with a pure @xmath7-dependence in the leading coefficient .",
    "agreement with all previous results @xcite in higher dimensions is thus re - established .    to perform instead",
    "the limit @xmath21 for generic values of @xmath42 in a rigorous way , turns out to be extremely difficult from a technical viewpoint . as a matter of fact the contribution coming from graphs with the triple gluon vertex ,",
    "exhibits quite involved analyticity properties in the variable @xmath42 .",
    "nevertheless , if such a limit is performed accepting a natural conjecture we shall explain later on , the result one gets exactly coincides with the gauge invariant one obtained in ref.@xcite for a loop of the same area with light - like sides ; thereby we enforce the argument that in two dimensions a pure area behavior is to be expected , no matter the orientation and the shape of the loop .",
    "in so doing , however , in two dimensions at @xmath2 a @xmath9-dependence is definetely there and there is no agreement with alte .",
    "the theory looks indeed discontinuous in the limit @xmath21 .",
    "details of the calculations are given in the appendices .",
    "we consider the usual `` gauge fixed '' yang - mills lagrangian , @xmath43 without loss of generality , we consider @xmath11 as gauge group , so that the field strength in ( [ lagrangian ] ) is defined as @xmath44 , @xmath45 being the structure constants of @xmath11 .",
    "we consider the closed path @xmath46 parametrized by the following four segments @xmath47 , @xmath48 describing a ( counterclockwise - oriented ) rectangle centered at the origin of the plane ( @xmath49 ) , with length sides @xmath50 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "then , for the definition of the wilson loop around @xmath46 we shall adopt the standard one , given by the following vacuum to vacuum amplitude @xmath51    gauge fields in time and @xmath52 orders generators @xmath53 of the gauge group @xmath11 along the closed integration path @xmath46 .",

    "it is easy to show that the perturbative expansion of @xmath59 is an even power series in the coupling constant , so that we can write @xmath60    an explicit evaluation of the function @xmath61 in eq .",

    "@xcite , which was evaluated in the same gauge choice but with the loop sides along the @xmath13 and @xmath66 directions .",
    "contrary to what happens in ref .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "( [ singleexchange ] ) exhibits an explicit dependence on the ratio @xmath38 . only in the two dimensional limit",
    "the two results coincide : the limit @xmath67 is smooth and gives the pure area dependence @xmath68    the diagrams contributing to @xmath69 can be grouped into three distinct families    @xmath70 :    * the ones with a double gluon exchange in which the propagators can either cross or uncross ; * the ones in which the gluon propagator contains a self - energy correction ; * the ones involving a triple vector coupling .    in strictly two dimensions and in an axial gauge",
    "only the first family is present . in feynman gauge all of them",
    "must be taken into account ; moreover we are here considering the problem in d - dimensions .",
    "the first family is also the only one contributing to the abelian case .",
    "we start by considering the diagrams belonging to the first category : a straightforward calculation gives @xmath71    d_{\\mu\\nu}(x - y)d_{\\rho\\sigma}(z - w)\\ ;   dx^{\\mu}dy^{\\nu}dz^{\\rho}dw^{\\sigma}\\;\\ ; , \\label{w4}\\ ] ] where subscripts in the matrices have been introduced to specify their ordering . from eq .",
    "( [ w4 ] ) , the diagrams with two - gluons exchanges contributing to the order @xmath72 in the perturbative expansion of the wilson loop fall into two distinct classes , depending on the topology of the diagrams :    1 .   _ non - crossed diagrams _ : if the pairs @xmath73 and @xmath74 are contiguous around the loop the two propagators do not cross ( see fig . [ fig2]a ) and the trace in ( [ w4 ] ) gives @xmath75 = n c_f^2 $ ] .",
    "2 .   _ crossed diagrams _ : if the pairs @xmath73 and @xmath74 are not contiguous around the loop the two propagators do cross ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) and the trace in ( [ w4 ] ) gives @xmath76 = { \\rm tr } [ t^a ( t^a t^b + [ t^b , t^a])t^b]= n ( c_f^2 - ( 1/2 ) c_a c_f)$ ] , @xmath9 being the casimir constant of the adjoint representation defined by @xmath77 .",
    "we see that the @xmath78 term is present in both types of diagrams and with the same coefficient .",
    "this term is usually denoted `` abelian term '' : were the theory abelian , only such @xmath78 terms would contribute to the loop .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath79 term is present only in crossed diagrams , and is typical of non - abelian theories .",
    "thus , we can decompose @xmath80 as the sum of an abelian and a non - abelian part , @xmath81 moreover , the abelian part is simply half of the square of the order-@xmath82 term , i.e. @xmath83 equation ( [ w4ab ] ) is just a particular case of a more general theorem due to frenkel and taylor @xcite , which proves that the only relevant terms in the perturbative expansion of the loop are the so - called `` maximally non - abelian '' ones ; at @xmath2 those terms are just proportional to @xmath79 .",
    "they are the only ones we have to evaluate to get @xmath84 .",
    "all the abelian terms ( depending only on @xmath7 ) in the perturbative expansion of the wilson loop sum up to reproduce the abelian exponential @xmath85 where the result in eq.([singleexchange ] ) can be introduced .",
    "this result at @xmath2 has been explicitly checked calculating the relevant non - crossed exchange diagrams ( see appendix a for details ) .    in the limit @xmath21 the simple exponentiation of the area is easily recovered @xmath86 , \\label{area}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the area of the loop .",
    "we have now to calculate loop integrals of the type given in eq.([w4 ] ) . in view of the parametrization ( [ path ] ) , it is convenient to decompose loop integrals as sums of integrals over the segments @xmath47 , and to this purpose we define @xmath88 \\dot\\gamma_i^\\mu(s ) \\dot\\gamma_j^\\nu(t ) \\",
    ", \\qquad i , j=1,\\dots , 4\\ \\ , , \\label{e}\\ ] ] where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the variable parametrizing the segment . in this way",
    ", each diagram can be written as integrals of products of functions of the type ( [ e ] ) .",
    "each graph will be labelled by a set of pairs @xmath89 , each pair denoting a gluon propagator joining the segments @xmath47 and @xmath90 .    due to the symmetric choice of the contour @xmath46 and to the fact that propagators are even functions ,",
    "i.e. @xmath91 , we have the following identities that halve the number of diagrams to be evaluated : @xmath92    we remind the reader that in feynman gauge the propagators can attach either to the same rectangle side or to opposite sides , but not on a couple of contiguous ones .",
    "we have now to consider the @xmath93-terms . from the previous discussion it follows that only `` crossed diagrams '' ( maximally non - abelian ones ) need to be evaluated    @xmath94    where the primes mean that we have to sum only over crossed propagators configurations and over topologically inequivalent contributions , as carefully explained in the following ; we have not specified the integration extrema as they depend on the particular type of crossed diagram we are considering ( the extrema must be chosen in such a way that propagators remain crossed ) .",
    "the last equality in eq . ( [ doppi ] ) defines the general diagram @xmath95 : it is a diagram with two _ crossed _ propagators joining the sides @xmath96 and @xmath97 of the contour ( [ path ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] a few examples of diagrams are drawn to get the reader acquainted with the notation .",
    "the first of eq .",
    "( [ sym ] ) permits to select just 11 types of topologically distinct crossed diagrams .",
    "the remaining symmetry relations ( [ sym ] ) further lower the number to 7 . as a matter of fact , although topologically inequivalent , from eq . ( [ sym ] )",
    "it is easy to get @xmath98 which are the 4 relations needed to lower the number of diagrams to be evaluated from 11 to 7 . besides the 8 diagrams quoted in eq .",
    "( [ relations ] ) , there are three other crossed diagrams that do not possess any apparent symmetry relation with other diagrams : @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( see fig . [ fig4 ] ) , so that the number of topologically inequivalent crossed diagrams is indeed 11 .",
    "the calculation of the 7 independent diagrams needed is lengthy and not trivial .",
    "the details of such calculation are reported in appendix a. each diagram depends not only on the area @xmath101 of the loop , but also on the dimensionless ratio @xmath102 through complicated multiple integrals involving powers depending on @xmath103 .    adding all the contributions as in eq .",
    "( [ doppi ] ) we eventually arrive at the following result @xmath2 for the non - abelian part of the exchange diagrams contribution : @xmath104\\big ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we notice that the expression above exhibits a double and a single pole at @xmath105 , whose laurent expansion gives @xmath106 @xmath46 being the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "we turn now our attention to the calculation of @xmath107 , namely of the diagrams with a single gluon exchange in which the propagator contains a self - energy correction @xmath36 .",
    "of course both gluon and ghost contribute to the self - energy .",
    "the color factor is obviously a pure @xmath25 .",
    "we call them `` bubble '' diagrams .",
    "we denote by @xmath108 the contribution of the diagram in which the propagator connects the rectangle segments @xmath47 , @xmath90 ( see fig . [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "there are 10 topologically inequivalent diagrams ; however , the symmetries we have already discussed and the symmetric choice of the contour entails the four conditions @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , whereas the remaining two diagrams @xmath113 and @xmath114 are unrelated by any symmetry relation . in addition , it is easy to see by perfoming a simple change of variable that @xmath115 and @xmath116 are equal .",
    "thus , there are 5 independent diagrams to be evaluated @xmath117    the details of the calculation are described in appendix b. we here report the final result in the form of an expansion with respect to the variable @xmath42 @xmath118.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again we notice the presence of a double and of a single pole at @xmath119 the relevant laurent expansion is @xmath120 .5truecm    the third quantity @xmath121 is by far the most difficult one to be evaluated .",
    "it comes from `` spider '' diagrams , namely the diagrams containing the triple gluon vertex ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath122 the contribution of the diagram in which the propagators are attached to the segments @xmath47 , @xmath90 , @xmath123 .",
    "it can be checked that all the spiders with the three legs attached to the same line vanish , as well as the spiders with two legs on one side and the third leg attached to the opposite side , _ i.e. _ @xmath124 .",
    "thus , there are 12 non - vanishing topologically inequivalent diagrams ; however , their number is just halved by the symmetric choice of the contour ( @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) , so that @xmath131 can be expressed in terms of the remaining 6 independent ones @xmath132 each term is represented by a multiple integral which can not be evaluated for a generic dimension @xmath103 in closed form . in particular",
    "it exhibits complicated analyticity properties in the variable @xmath42 , just in the neighborhood of the value @xmath133 which is of interest for us .",
    "details of the calculation are again deferred to an appendix ( appendix c ) .",
    "we have succeeded in obtaining the following result for @xmath4 @xmath134 a double and a single pole at @xmath26 again are present in this expression .",
    "since the abelian part of our results depends only on the casimir constant @xmath7 and smoothly exponentiates in the large-@xmath34 limit even when @xmath4 ( see eqs.([singleexchange],[abexp ] ) ) , in the following we focus our attention on the non - abelian part , namely on the quantity containing the factor @xmath25 @xmath135    it is actually convenient to divide by the square of the loop area , by introducing the new expression @xmath136 @xmath137 then , from eqs.([wmlg4],[bubble],[ragnilaurent ] ) , it is easy to conclude that , thanks to the factor @xmath138 , @xmath136 vanishes in the limit @xmath35 when @xmath139 .",
    "this is precisely the usual necessary condition required at @xmath2 in order to get agreement with alte when summing higher orders@xcite .",
    "we can not discuss the limit @xmath140 for generic ( small ) values of @xmath42 in our results as we are only able to master the expressions at @xmath133 .",
    "nevertheless if we consider the quantity @xmath141 we get a quite interesting result . indeed double and simple poles at @xmath142 cancel in the sum , leading to @xmath143",
    "which _ exactly _ coincides with eq.(13 ) of @xcite .",
    "this is , first of all , a formidable check of all our calculations , if we conjecture that the same result is obtained by performing the limit @xmath144 but it also entails the quite non trivial consequences we are going to discuss .    at a first sight one could have thought to recover the result obtained in strictly 1 + 1 dimensions in ref.@xcite .",
    "this is not the case ; as a matter of fact in strictly 1 + 1 dimensions and in light - cone gauge the contribution from diagrams containing a self - energy insertion is missing , in spite of the fact that , if calculated first at @xmath139 , it does not vanish in the limit .",
    "this phenomenon has been discussed at length in ref.@xcite .    what may be surprising is that this extra contribution , required by gauge invariance , when considered in the limit @xmath145 , exhibits a pure area dependence on its own , being the same no matter the orientation of the loop .",
    "namely , the geometrical arguments ( invariance under area - preserving diffeomorphism ) which lead to a pure area dependence in two dimensions , but not in higher ones , are recovered in the limit @xmath145 , in spite of the singular nature of this limit , and of the difference in the two results ( with and without self - energy diagrams ) .",
    "we consider this point quite intriguing ; it seems that , in order to get beyond two dimensions towards higher ones , the theory needs further inputs which can not be _ a priori _ guessed in two dimensions .",
    "on the other hand it is known that operators exist which are irrelevant at @xmath139 , but can be competitive in exactly two dimensions @xcite .",
    "our result can therefore be interpreted as a warning when one tries to extend straightforwardly conclusions obtained in strictly two dimensions to more realistic situations .    before concluding let us summarize the main perturbative features which are common to both feynman and light - cone gauges .",
    "for @xmath4 the @xmath2 result depends on the contour : if it has lightlike sides , there is a dependence only on the area , no matter the value of @xmath23 .",
    "if instead the contour is a space - time rectangle , for @xmath4 there is also a dependence on the ratio @xmath146 , still reproducing the expected exponential behaviour in the limit @xmath147    the limit @xmath148 of such @xmath2 result is finite and depends only on the area , no matter the orientation and the shape of the contour .",
    "it consists of two addenda ( compare eq.(27 ) with eq.(13 ) of @xcite ) .    in light cone",
    "gauge the second addendum comes from ` crossed ' diagrams , the first one is due to the self - energy correction to the gluon propagator . in axial gauges the transverse degrees of freedom are coupled with a strenght of order @xmath149 ; nevertheless they produce a finite contribution when matching the self - energy loop singularity precisely at @xmath26 .    in exactly 1 + 1 dimensions",
    "therefore the first addendum is missing and one just gets the result of refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "its area dependence is hardly surprising in view of the symmetry under area preserving diffeomorphisms at @xmath26 ; it is perhaps remarkable that also the first addendum , which originates at @xmath4 , exhibits in the limit @xmath148 a pure area dependence on its own .",
    "however both contributions contain the factor @xmath25 and thereby disagree with the simple area exponentiation . at a perturbative level",
    "there is a discontinuity , which is not surprising in the light of the arguments presented in ref.@xcite ; however it does not explain why agreement with the simple area behaviour is not recovered .",
    "moreover , the authors of ref.@xcite , working in exactly 1 + 1 dimensions , have succeeded in resumming the perturbative series : the result they get does not exhibit the usual purely exponential area law . besides the appearance of laguerre polynomials , the coefficient in the exponent multiplying the area is different from the usual one .",
    "we are thereby faced with a discrepancy .",
    "now we want to discuss the consequences concerning alte in the large-@xmath34 limit .",
    "we have checked that our findings at @xmath150 comply with alte , as long as @xmath139 . at @xmath105",
    "this is not the case ; however it is likely that alte in this case is restored by genuine non perturbative contributions , reconciling gauge invariance with basic spectral properties and solving the paradox .    as a matter of fact the usual @xmath26 well established result can most safely be obtained by means of non perturbative techniques .",
    "actually one could also get it by resumming the perturbative series , but only in axial gauges with a peculiar prescription for the propagator ( the cauchy principal value , which is doubtful in @xmath26 and certainly incorrect for @xmath4 ) .",
    "the reason why this happens might be deep and related to peculiar properties of the @xmath26 light - front vacuum in light - front quantization .    at a non - perturbative level",
    "there are arguments which show that at large @xmath151 and on the sphere @xmath152 a phase transition occurs , induced by instantons ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the purely exponential area behaviour occurs only in the strong coupling phase , which is dominated by instantons . in the weak coupling phase the result is completely different and",
    "agrees ( after decompactification ) with the ones of refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why we believe that the discrepancy can be solved by taking instantons into account @xcite ; they obviously do not contribute to any perturbative calculation , even when the perturbative series is fully resummed .",
    "one could say that perturbative results are irrelevant at @xmath26 .",
    "we can not share this opinion . at @xmath4",
    "perturbative results are the only easily accessible ones ; several perturbative tests of gauge invariance have been performed in the past at @xmath4 , just _ assuming _ the simple area exponentiation in the large @xmath34-limit .",
    "one of the results of this paper is to prove that indeed at @xmath4 such an exponentiation occurs as expected .",
    "we do not think it is immaterial to understand how these nice features behave in the transition @xmath148 , also in order to contrast them against genuine non perturbative results .",
    "why genuinely non perturbative contributions , which are likely to be relevant also in higher dimensions , are crucial only in two dimensions to possibly recover alte , is at present unknown .",
    "this very interesting issue is under investigation and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "in order to get the @xmath2 contribution to the wilson loop arising from the exchange diagrams , we only have to evaluate the maximally non abelian diagrams , that in the present case are the so called crossed diagrams .",
