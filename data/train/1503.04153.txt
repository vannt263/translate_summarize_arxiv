    "in this paper , we consider nearly integrable hamiltonian systems of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is strictly convex , namely , the hessian matrix @xmath6 is positive definite .",
    "it is also assumed that both @xmath5 and @xmath7 are @xmath8-function with @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the problem of studying the ( in)stability of the above system @xmath11 was considered to be the fundamental problem of hamiltonian dynamics by poincar . according to the celebrated kam theorem",
    ", there exists a large measure cantor set of lagrangian tori on which the dynamics is conjugate to irrational rotations and the oscillation of the slow variable ( or called action variable ) @xmath12 is at most @xmath13 .",
    "the kam theorem also excludes the possibility of large oscillation of @xmath12 in the case of @xmath14 since each energy level , which is three dimensional , is laminated by two dimensional kam tori and each orbit either stays on a kam torus or is confined between two tori .",
    "for @xmath15 , there does not exist topological obstruction for the slow variables @xmath12 to have @xmath16 oscillation .",
    "arnold was the first one who had realized such instability @xcite and constructed the first example in @xcite half a century ago [ eqarnold ] h(i,,y , x , t)=++(x+1)(1+(+t ) ) , where there are orbits along which the action variable @xmath17 has as large oscillation as we wish .",
    "although the perturbation is far from being typical , arnold still proposed    * conjecture * ( @xcite ) : _ the  general case \" for a hamiltonian system with @xmath18 is represented by the situation that for an arbitrary pair of neighborhood of tori @xmath19 , @xmath20 , in one component of the level set @xmath21 there exists , for sufficiently small @xmath22 , an orbit intersecting both neighborhoods .",
    "_    the problem is named arnold diffusion . in recent years",
    ", it has become clear that arnold diffusion is a typical phenomenon in so called _ a priori _ unstable systems , which are small perturbation of compound pendulum - single rotator system .",
    "there are many works studying this problem based on two streams of methods : the variational method ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) and the geometric method ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . with the variational method ,",
    "the genericity of perturbations was established in @xcite , which relies on the existence of a normally hyperbolic invariant cylinder ( nhic ) of dimension two given by the _ a priori _ unstable condition .",
    "for the geometric method , we highlight the central object , the scattering map , whose symplectic properties are studied in details in @xcite .",
    "nearly integrable hamiltonian like is also called _ a priori _ stable system , where a frequency @xmath23 is said to admit a resonance relation , if there exists an integer vector @xmath24 such that @xmath25 at some point @xmath12 .",
    "the number of linearly independent resonance relations is called the multiplicity of the resonance . a bit away from strong multiple resonance in such systems ,",
    "some pieces of nhic still exist and the method for _ a priori _ unstable system can still be applied @xcite .",
    "however , these pieces of nhic are separated by small neighborhood of multiple resonances . without studying how to pass through neighborhood of strong multiple resonances , it would be impossible to construct orbits which can drift for large scale .",
    "the problem of arnold diffusion has a long history , and the mathematical issues that arise are subtle and technically involved .",
    "many key ideas can be traced back to the early published and unpublished work of mather ( see the announcement @xcite in 2004 and published errata @xcite in 2012 , as well as the paper @xcite ) . even in the case",
    "@xmath26 , there are ( as of the date of this paper ) no published proofs of diffusion .",

    "in april of 2014 , kaloshin and zhang posted on their webpages a 36-page announcement and key elements of a proof of diffusion @xcite in the case @xmath27 .",
    "subsequently , they posted on the arxiv in october 2014 a longer paper @xcite containing details of the announced proof as well as partial results and techniques applicable to @xmath28 .",

    "\\(2 ) * the cusp - residual condition*. roughly speaking , cusp - residual means that for generic @xmath84 , there is @xmath85 depending on @xmath7 such that admits diffusing orbit for generic @xmath86 , but for given @xmath22 , there is an open set on @xmath87 for @xmath1 therein the existence of diffusing orbit is not known .",
    "our cusp - residual set has an extra structure called multiple filtration described in section [ sgenericity ] , so we call it a multi - filtered cusp - residual ( mfcr ) set",
    ".    \\(3 ) * the smoothness of the perturbations . * the smoothness requirement @xmath68 matches the least kam smoothness threshold .",
    "namely , it was shown in @xcite that kam theory does not apply if the perturbation is small only in @xmath88 but not @xmath89-topology ( see remark [ rksmooth ] ) .",
    "our theorem holds also for @xmath90 but the analytic perturbation case of arnold diffusion remains open ( see @xcite for a result on _ a priori _ chaotic systems ) . on the other hand , for hamiltonians with low regularity",
    ", connecting lemma techniques can be applied to get topologically mixing for  most hamiltonian \" and  most energy levels \" @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for other related results on @xmath91 generic symplectomorphisms .",
    "robust transitivity is shown in @xcite to be true for an open set of hamiltonians in @xmath92 by introducing a symplectic blender . for non hamiltonian but volume preserving @xmath91 generic diffeomorphisms ,",
    "it is shown in @xcite that there is a dichotomy , i.e. either zero metric entropy or the volume being ergodic .",
    "this theorem is proved by variational method .",
    "the diffusion orbits are constructed to * move along many pieces of nhic * and to * cross multiple - strong resonance point * ( join two pieces of nhic ) .",
    "the construction of diffusing orbits involves understanding the pictures in four different spaces : the frequency space , the phase space , the parameter space ( or the cohomology space @xmath93 ) and the function space , of which we have a clear understanding summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the frequency space picture .    *",
    "it is a folklore theorem that fourier modes in the span@xmath94 appears in the kam normal form if @xmath95 is a resonance relation to the frequency @xmath96 ( section [ sct : normalform ] ) . in other words ,",
    " resonance produces pendulum \" .",
    "* we show that for any two balls in the frequency space , there is a connected curve joining them with a hierarchy structure ( section [ ssadm ] ) .",
    "namely , along the curve each frequency has at least @xmath97 linearly independent resonant integer vectors @xmath98 forming a hierarchy @xmath99 except for finitely many points , there are @xmath100 linearly independent resonant integer vectors @xmath101 forming a hierarchy @xmath102 , for some @xmath103 and @xmath104 is comparable to @xmath105 .",
    "\\(2 ) the phase space picture .",
    "* the orbits always shadow certain aubry - mather set for twist maps or subsystems of two degrees of freedom . * the ( un)stable  manifolds \" of these aubry - mather set",
    "do not always need to intersect _ transversally _ in order to implement arnold s mechanism . in some circumstance",
    ", it is enough to have incomplete intersections ( see theorem [ thmtypeht ] ) , namely they do not split along some but not all directions .",
    "\\(3 ) the parameter space ( the cohomology space @xmath93 ) picture .    * based on the complete understanding of the flat of the @xmath106 function for systems of two degrees of freedom in @xcite .",
    "we get a continuous path in @xmath93 along which the @xmath107-equivalence is always satisfied ( section [ sceq ] ) . *",
    "the difficulty of the high dimensionality manifests itself as the channel misalignment problem ( see fig [ fig1 ] and compare fig [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "we address it by introducing a ladder construction ( section [ ssladder ] ) .",
    "the corresponding picture in the frequency path has a detour of order @xmath108 close to strong double resonance ( see fig [ figfreq ] ) .",
    "\\(4 ) the function space picture .",
    "* we get a mfcr set using the parametric transversality ( pt ) results established in @xcite , perturbations in which admit diffusing orbit ( section [ sgenericity ] ) . *",
    "we verify the assumptions for the pt results by showing that the weak kam solutions for systems with two degrees of freedom restricted to the energy level can be parametrized to have @xmath109 hlder regularity with respect to the parameter .",
    "this is used in the ladder construction .",
    "case , ( red ) curves of cohomology equivalence , width=294,height=151 ]     case , the pizza and the ladder climbing , width=332,height=132 ]    most of the above outlined work is devoted to understanding the dynamics near complete resonance where the frequency @xmath96 admits @xmath110 resonance relations two of which are strong .",
    "the main difficulty comes from the nonperturbative nature of the dynamics near strong resonance which is intrinsic to the _ a priori _ stable systems . our work on crossing the complete resonance may have broader interests beyond arnold diffusion .",
    "away from the strong resonances along the frequency line , nhics can be found so that the problem is reduced to the well understood _ a priori _ unstable system .",
    "we next briefly explain the construction of nhics approaching the multiple - strong resonant points .",
    "a general idea is that sufficiently weak resonance can be averaged and treated as small perturbation to those stronger resonance terms . in the earlier papers @xcite this idea is used , where the  dominant structure \" is introduced to find a path of nhic .",
    "independently , we work out this idea in this paper in the following way .",
    "inspired by arnold s remark in @xcite  it is necessary to examine the transition from single to double resonance \" we choose the frequency line @xmath111 carefully , where @xmath112 is of diophantine .",
    "when the parameter @xmath113 varies in an interval , we get a path in @xmath114 by choosing suitable @xmath115 .",
    "1 .   two types of kam iteration are introduced so that we reduce the system ( [ eqham ] ) into a locally defined system with one less degree of freedom for generic hamiltonian .",
    "it is guaranteed by a result @xcite saying that a hamiltonian system restricted on the nhim is still hamiltonian .",
    "restricted on nhim , the frequency vector turns out to be @xmath116 after transformed by unimodular matrix .",
    "the zero entry in @xmath117 corresponds to the normal dimension , which is eliminated by the reduction .",
    "next , we approximate @xmath118 by a vector @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is of diophantine such that the new line segment @xmath121 has the same structure as the @xmath122 before",
    ". 2 .   around strong double resonant point ,",
    "extra action - angle coordinates are introduced ( center straightening ) so that the reduced system is nearly integrable again .",
    "such coordinate transformation is singular only at the double resonant point .",
    "it allows us to repeat the procedure of reduction in place arbitrarily close to the multiple - strong resonance points .",
    "3 .   in our reduction of order",
    ", we obtain explicitly hamiltonian systems of one less degrees of freedom and during each reduction of order we have at most two resonances to consider .",
    "such procedure is repeated for @xmath123 steps , certain nhics are found to reach @xmath124 neighborhoods of multiple - strong resonant points with @xmath125 .",
    "once nhics are obtained , we can construct diffusion orbits along these nhics by the method developed in @xcite .",
    "the choice of path for nhic in @xcite is top - down .",
    "they first show that there exists  a connected @xmath126-dense admissible diffusion path \" , by considering all resonant integer vectors satisfying certain assumptions , then choose the path implicitly from this connected set .",
    "our approach is bottom - up .",
    "we first choose our diffusing path ( frequency line segment ) explicitly then determine all its resonance integer vectors explicitly .",
    "for any given two balls in the frequency space , we find a path connecting two rational points in the balls . to see the picture clearly ,",
    "let us map the frequency path to @xmath127 by setting @xmath128 .",
    "then the two rational points , as two opposite vertices , determines a cuboid .",
    "our path connects the two opposite vertices moving along the edges of the cuboid and has the hierarchy structure described before .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sct :",
    "normalform ] , to get two normal forms corresponding to single or double resonances we design two types of kam iteration by applying a proceeding homogenization procedure , which are used to construct two type of reductions of order in section [ sreduction ] correspondingly .",
    "one is for single and weak double resonance , another one is for strong double resonance so that we get a hamiltonian system with one less degrees of freedom .",
    "such construction is based on normally hyperbolic invariant manifold theorems and its hamiltonian version following @xcite .",
    "special efforts are made for strong double resonance , includes locating of nhics around the strong double resonance following @xcite , introducing new action - angle coordinates and performing shear transformation . in section [ shierarchy ] ,",
    "we show how to perform the procedure of reduction of order of section [ sreduction ] inductively to get nhics of two dimensions .",
    "we also explain how to connect two @xmath126 balls in the frequency space by frequency lines of the standard form @xmath122 . in section [ saubry ] ,",
    "we give a description of the aubry set along the frequency line segment and around multiple - strong resonant points . in section [ sceq ] ,",
    "we show how to pass through multiple - strong resonance , it involves  ladder climbing \" to overcome the difficulty created by the triple or more multiple - strong resonance , building up the cohomology equivalence which is used to turn around the multiple - strong resonance . in section [ svariation ] ,",
    "we show how to construct diffusing orbits variationally . in section [ sgenericity ] ,",
    "we recapitulate all the genericity assumptions that we made and give a proof of the main theorem . in section [ smodulus ]",
    ", we establish a hlder regularity result for the parametrized weak kam solutions , which is needed to complete the genericity argument of ladder construction . finally , we give the preliminaries of the mather theory and weak kam in the appendix [ appmather ] .      in this section ,",
