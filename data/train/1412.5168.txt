    "<S> * for many decades , the magnetic field induced changes in the conductivity of metals were the subject of intense interest not only for their own sake , but also as a valuable tool for determining their fermi surface geometry @xcite . here , </S>",
    "<S> we report a hitherto unobserved magnetoresistive effect in ultra - clean layered metals . </S>",
    "<S> we detect a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance that is capable of overcoming their very pronounced orbital magnetoresistance . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this effect is correlated with the inter - layer coupling , and disappears for fields applied along the so - called yamaji angles where the inter - layer coupling vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this effect seems to be intrinsically associated with the existence of fermi points in the field - induced , quasi - one - dimensional electronic dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this effect results from the axial anomaly among fermi points . in its original formulation </S>",
    "<S> the anomaly leads to the violation of separate number conservation laws for left- and right - handed chiral , or weyl - fermions . for a certain class of gapless semiconductors , </S>",
    "<S> it was predicted to induce a large suppression of the electrical resistivity , as observed here . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of this effect in pdcoo@xmath0 , ptcoo@xmath0 and sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 suggests that it would be generic to clean metals ( or semi - metals ) near the quantum limit . *    </S>",
    "<S> the magneto - conductivity or -resistivity of metals under a uniform magnetic field @xmath2 is highly dependent on the precise shape of their fermi surface ( fs ) and on the orientation of the current flow relative to the external field . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly true for high purity metals at low temperatures whose carriers may execute many cyclotronic orbits in between scattering events . </S>",
    "<S> however , the description of the magnetoconductivity of real systems in terms of the boltzmann equation including the lorentz force , the electronic dispersion , and realistic scattering potentials is an incredibly daunting task , whose approximate solutions can only be obtained through over simplifications . despite the inherent difficulty in describing the magnetoresistivity of metallic or semi - metallic systems , it continues to be a subject of intense interest . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in recent years , a number of new magnetoresistance phenomena have been uncovered . </S>",
    "<S> for example , although semi - classical transport theory predicts a magnetoresistivity @xmath3 , certain compounds such as @xmath4-ag@xmath0te display a linear , non - saturating magnetoresistivity@xcite which is ascribed to thequantum magnetoresistive \" scenario@xcite , associated with linearly dispersing dirac - like bands @xcite . however , in semi - metals characterized by a bulk dirac dispersion and extremely high electron mobilities such as cd@xmath5as@xmath0 , the linear magnetoresistivity develops a weak @xmath6 term as the quality of the sample increases@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its enormous magnetoresistivity is claimed to result from the suppression of a certain protection against backscattering channels @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the semi - metal wte@xmath0 was also found to display a  titanic \" and non - saturating magnetoresistivity which is @xmath7 under fields up to 60 t. this behavior ascribed to a nearly perfect compensation between the densities of electrons and holes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a series of compounds were proposed to be weyl semimetal candidates characterized by a linear touching between the valence and the conduction bands at several points ( weyl points ) of their brillouin zone @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these weyl points are predicted to lead to a pronounced negative magnetoresistivity for electric fields aligned along a magnetic field due to the so - called adler - abel - jackiw axial anomaly @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we unveil the observation of yet a novel magnetoresistive effect , namely a pronounced _ negative _ magnetoresistivity in extremely clean and non - magnetic layered metals . </S>",
    "<S> we study the langasites ptcoo@xmath0 and pdcoo@xmath0 which are characterized by a single fs sheet and as cd@xmath5as@xmath0 can display residual resistivities on the order of a just few tenths of n@xmath8 cm . given its extreme low level of disorder , for specific field orientations along which the inter - layer coupling vanishes </S>",
    "<S> , pdcoo@xmath0 can display a very pronounced positive magnetoresistivity which exceeds 550000% for @xmath9 t and for currents along the inter - layer axis . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , as soon as the field is rotated away from these specific orientations and as the field increases , this large orbital effect is overwhelmed by the emergence of a pronounced negative magnetoresistivity . for fields along the inter - layer direction , </S>",
    "<S> a strong longitudinal negative magnetoresistivity ( lnmr ) is observed from @xmath10 t to fields all the way up to @xmath11 t. very similar behavior is observed in the ptcoo@xmath0 compound . for the correlated sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> the lnmr - effect is also observable but only in the cleanest samples , i.e. , those displaying the highest superconducting transition temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this new effect might result from the axial anomaly between fermi points in a field - induced , quasi - one - dimensional electronic dispersion . as shown in the fig . 1**a * * pdcoo@xmath0 crystallizes in the space group @xmath12 , which results from the stacking of monatomic triangular layers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the synthesis of pdcoo@xmath0 single crystals is described in the methods section . according to band structure calculations  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the fermi level @xmath13 is placed between the filled @xmath14 and the empty @xmath15 levels with the pd triangular planes dominating the conductivity , and leading to its highly anisotropic transport properties . </S>",
    "<S> the reported room temperature in - plane resistivity @xmath16 is just @xmath17 @xmath18 cm , making pdcoo@xmath0 perhaps the most conductive oxide known to date@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1**b * * and 1**c * * show the configuration of contacts used for measuring the longitudinal magnetoresistivity of all compounds . </S>",
    "<S> de haas van alphen ( dhva ) measurements  @xcite reveal a single , corrugated and nearly two - dimensional fermi surface ( fs ) with a rounded hexagonal cross - section , in broad agreement with both band structure calculations @xcite and angle resolved photoemission measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dhva yields an average fermi wave - vector @xmath19 m@xmath20 or an average fermi velocity @xmath21 m / s ( where @xmath22 is the carrier effective mass  @xcite in units of free electron mass ) . </S>",
    "<S> recent measurements of inter - planar magnetoresistivity @xmath23 reveal an enormous enhancement for fields along the [ 1@xmath240]-direction , i.e. , increasing by @xmath25 % at 2 k under @xmath26 t , which does not follow the characteristic @xmath3 dependence at higher fields  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can be reproduced qualitatively by semi - classical calculations , assuming a very small scattering rate  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most single - crystals display in - plane residual resistivities @xmath27 ranging from only @xmath28 up to @xmath29 n@xmath8 cm , which correspond to transport lifetimes @xmath30 ranging from @xmath31 down to @xmath32 ps ( @xmath33 is the electron charge and @xmath34 m@xmath35 @xcite ) or mean free paths @xmath36 ranging from @xmath37 up to 20 @xmath38 m  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , according to ref .   </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticle life - time @xmath39 extracted from the dingle temperature becomes ( in units of length ) @xmath40 @xmath38 m . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the transport life time is larger than the quasiparticle life time by at least one order of magnitude , which is the hallmark of a predominant forward scattering mechanism , see ref . . </S>",
    "<S> for a magnetic field along @xmath41 axis , @xmath42 when @xmath43 t , in contrast @xmath44 when @xmath45 t. these estimations suggest the importance of the landau quantization for understanding our observations over a wide range of fields up to @xmath46 t.    as shown in figure 2**a * * , the low-@xmath47 magnetoresistivity or @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the zero - field inter - planar resistivity , decreases ( up to @xmath50 % ) in a magnetic field of 30 t oriented parallel to the applied current . </S>",
    "<S> given that pdcoo@xmath0 is non - magnetic and extremely clean ( see methods ) , this effect can not be attributed to magnetic impurities . in addition , given the magnitude of the effect it can not be explained in terms of the suppression of weak localization  @xcite . to support both statements , in fig . 2**b * * we show @xmath51 for a pdcoo@xmath0 single - crystal as a function of @xmath2 applied along the @xmath52 $ ] planar - direction and for several temperatures @xmath47 . in sharp contrast to results shown in fig . 2**a * * , as @xmath47 decreases @xmath53 increases considerably , by more than 3 orders of magnitude when @xmath54 k , thus confirming the absence of scattering by magnetic impurities or any role for weak localization . </S>",
    "<S> notice also that @xmath55 at low fields , which indicates that the inter - layer transport is _ coherent _ at low fields@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2**c * * depicts a simple kohler plot of the magnetoresistivity shown in * b * , where the field has also been normalized by @xmath56 , which indicates unambiguously , that the transverse magnetoresistive effect in pdcoo@xmath0 is exclusively orbital in character and is dominated by the scattering from impurities / imperfections and phonons@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of this effect with temperature is depicted in figure 3**a**. @xmath57 is seen to decrease by a factor surpassing 60 % for fields approaching 9 t and for all temperatures below 30 k. figure 3**b * * displays @xmath58 as a function of the angle @xmath59 between @xmath2 and the _ c_-axis at a temperature @xmath60 k , for a third single - crystal . for @xmath61 the pronounced positive magnetoresistance observed at low fields , due to a classical orbital magnetoresistive effect , </S>",
    "<S> is overpowered at higher fields by the mechanism responsible for the negative magnetoresistivity . </S>",

    "<S> * * , all curves collapse on a single curve indicating that a particular transport mechanism dominates even at high temperatures where phonon scattering is expected to be strong . </S>",
    "<S> the red line is a simple linear fit , indicating that @xmath64 at lower fields . </S>",
    "<S> supplementary figure s1 shows the longitudinal magnetoresistance @xmath65}(h)/\\rho_0 $ ] for fields and currents along the @xmath52$]-axis . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to @xmath63 , but similarly to the longitudinal magnetoresistivity of ultra - clean elemental metals @xcite , @xmath65}(h)/\\rho_0 $ ] is observed to increase and saturate as a function of @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 4**a * * shows @xmath57 as a function of the angle @xmath59 between the field and the _ c_-axis , for three different field values : 8 , 25 and 30 t. @xmath66 displays the characteristic structure displayed by quasi - two - dimensional metals , namely a series of sharp peaks at specific angles @xmath67 called yamaji angles ( where @xmath68 is an integer , @xmath41 is the inter - planar distance , and @xmath69 is the projection of the fermi wave number on the conduction plane ) , for which _ all _ cyclotronic orbits on the fs have an _ identical _ orbital area  @xcite . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the corrugation of the fs no longer leads to a distribution of cross - sectional areas , as if the corrugation has been effectively suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed below , in terms of the energy spectrum , this means that the landau levels become non - dispersive at the yamaji angles  @xcite , hence one no longer has fermi points . </S>",
    "<S> the sharp peak at @xmath70 is attributed to coherent electron transport along small closed orbits on the sides of a corrugated cylindrical fermi surface@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the width of this peak @xmath71 , shown in fig . 4**b * * for several temperatures , allows us to estimate the interlayer transfer integral @xmath72@xcite , @xmath73 assuming a simple sinusoidal fermi surface corrugation along the @xmath74-direction . here </S>",
    "<S> , the inter - planar separation is @xmath75 , since there are three conducting pd planes per unit cell , each providing one conducting hole and therefore leading to 3 carriers per unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> this value is consistent with our hall - effect measurements ( not included here ) . </S>",
    "<S> the full width at half maximum of the peak at @xmath76 is @xmath77 and @xmath13 is given by @xmath78 ev , therefore one obtains @xmath79 mev or @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4**c * * displays @xmath57 as a function of @xmath2 for two angles ; the yamaji angle @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively . as seen , @xmath83 for fields along @xmath84 displays a very pronounced positive magnetoresistance , i.e. @xmath85 increases by @xmath86 % when @xmath2 is swept from 0 to 35 t. but at @xmath87 t @xmath85 decreases by one order of magnitude as @xmath2 is rotated by just @xmath88 with respect @xmath84 . furthermore , as seen in fig . 4**d * * , at higher fields @xmath57 displays a crossover from a very pronounced and positive to a negative magnetoresistance , resulting from a small increment in @xmath59 relative to @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a very clear indication for two competing mechanisms , with negative magnetoresistivity overcoming the orbital - effect when the orbitally - averaged inter - layer group velocity ( or the transfer integral @xmath72 ) becomes finite at @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that for a conventional and very clean metal , composed of a single fermi surface sheet , the magnetoresistivity should either be @xmath7 @xcite or saturate as seen in quasi - two - dimensional metals close to the yamaji angle@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated by the supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s2 which contrasts our experimental observations with predictions based on semi - classical transport models which correctly describe the magnetoresistance of layered organic metals in the vicinity of the yamaji angle . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 also displays shubnikov de haas oscillations at small ( and strongly @xmath59-dependent ) frequencies which were not previously detected in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> these slow oscillations , observed only in the interlayer magnetoresistance of layered metals , originate from the warping of the fs . in the supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s3 , we show how these frequencies disappear when the group velocity vanishes at @xmath90 .    </S>",
    "<S> significantly , this novel effect does not appear to be confined to pdcoo@xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> s4 displays the observation of impurity dependent negative magnetoresistivity in the correlated perovskite sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5**a * * , ptcoo@xmath0 presents a pronounced negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity either for @xmath91 _ c_-axis or for @xmath2 close to an yamaji angle . </S>",
    "<S> it also presents a very pronounced and non - saturating magnetoresistivy for fields applied along the yamaji angle . for both systems the magnetoresistivity does not follow a single power law as a function of @xmath2 . in fact , as shown in the supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s4 , at @xmath90 the magnetoresistivity of the ( pt , pd)coo@xmath0 system follows a @xmath6 dependence for @xmath92 t. at intermediate fields @xmath93 deviates from the quadratic dependence , recovering it again at subsequently higher @xmath2s . </S>",
    "<S> since kohler s rule implies that @xmath94 , we argue that the observed increase in slope would imply a field - dependent reduction in scattering by impurities ( see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s5 and related discussion ) . </S>",
    "<S> the precise origin of this suppression in scattering remains to be identified . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the enormous and positive magnetoresistivity observed for fields along @xmath90 seems consistent with a simple scenario , i.e. , a extremely clean system(s ) whose impurity scattering weakens with increasing magnetic field . in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , the negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity </S>",
    "<S> is observed only in the cleanest samples and for angles within @xmath95 away from the _ c_-axis . </S>",
    "<S> this compound is characterized by three corrugated cylindrical fermi surface sheets , each leading to a distinct set of yamaji - angles , making it impossible to completely suppress the inter - planar coupling at specific yamaji angle(s ) .    </S>",
    "<S> negative magnetoresistivity is a common feature of ferromagnetic metals near their curie temperature , or of samples having dimensions comparable to their electronic mean free path where the winding up of the electronic orbits under a magnetic field reduces the scattering from the surface . </S>",
    "<S> it can also result from the field - induced suppression of weak localization or from the field - induced suppression of spin - scattering / quantum - fluctuations as seen in _ </S>",
    "<S> f_-electron compounds@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> none of these compounds , are near a magnetic instability , contain significant amounts of magnetic impurities or disorder making them prone to weak localization . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of this anomalous magnetoresistivity , coupled to its peculiar angular dependence , are in fact enough evidence against any of these conventional mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> below , we discuss an alternative scenario based on the so - called axial anomaly which in our opinion explains most of our observations .    </S>",
    "<S> the axial anomaly is a fundamental concept of relativistic quantum field theory , which describes the violation of separate number conservation laws of left and right handed massless chiral fermions in odd spatial dimensions due to quantum mechanical effects  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , when three dimensional massless dirac or weyl fermions are placed under parallel electric and magnetic fields , the number difference between the left and the right handed fermions is expected to vary with time according to the adler - bell - jackiw formula  @xcite @xmath96 here , @xmath97 are the number operators for the right and the left handed weyl fermions , with the electric and the magnetic field strengths respectively given by @xmath98 and @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> the dirac fermion describes the linear touching of two - fold kramers degenerate conduction and valence bands at isolated momentum points in the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> the axial anomaly was initially proposed to produce a large , negative longitudinal magnetoresistance , for a class of gapless semiconductors , for which the low energy band structure is described by massless weyl fermions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for the negative magnetoresistance is relatively straighforward . </S>",
    "<S> assume that in very clean system the impurity scattering potential can be described by a smoothly decaying function @xmath100 which peaks at @xmath101 ( e.g. gaussian ) hence producing scattering at low angles . </S>",
    "<S> once an external @xmath2 is applied , the system would require backscattering at the larger momentum transfer @xmath102 which connects both weyl - points in _ k_-space in order to equilibrate the field - induced net number imbalance among right and left handed fermions produced by the anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> given the functional form of @xmath100 , backscattering at @xmath102 will be considerably weaker than backscattering at @xmath101 . therefore , the role of the anomaly is to suppress backscattering causing a net decrease in the resistivity under an applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical proposals for weyl semimetals  @xcite have revived the interest in the experimental confirmation of the axial anomaly through efforts in detecting negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are examples of three dimensional dirac semimetals  @xcite , which may be converted , through zeeman splitting , into a weyl semimetal . </S>",
    "<S> examples include bi@xmath103sb@xmath104 at the band inversion transition point between topologically trivial and nontrivial insulators @xcite , and cd@xmath5as@xmath0  @xcite .    in analogy with the predictions for the axial anomaly between weyl points </S>",
    "<S> , here we suggest that our observations might be consistent with the emergence of the axial anomaly among the _ fermi _ points of a field - induced , one - dimensional electronic dispersion @xcite . in effect , in the presence of a strong magnetic field , the quantization of cyclotron motion leads to discrete landau levels with one dimensional dispersion and a degeneracy factor @xmath105 , see figs . </S>",
    "<S> 6**a , b , * * and * c*. consider the low energy description of a one dimensional electron gas , in terms of the right- and left - handed fermions obtained in the vicinity of the two fermi points . in the presence of an external electric field </S>",
    "<S> @xmath98 , the separate number conservation of these chiral fermions is violated according to @xmath106where @xmath97 respectively correspond to the number operators of the right- and left - handed fermions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each partially occupied landau level leads to a set of fermi points , and the axial anomaly for such a level can be obtained from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq2 ] , after multiplying by @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore each level has an axial anomaly determined by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> when _ only one _ landau level is partially filled , we have the remarkable universal result for the axial anomaly described by adler - bell - jackiw formula of eq .  [ eq1 ] . for </S>",
    "<S> a non - relativistic electron gas this would occur at the quantum limit . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , this situation would naturally occur for dirac / weyl semimetals , when the fermi level lies at zero energy . </S>",
    "<S> figure 6**b * * describes the situation for a quasi - two dimensional electronic system upon approaching the quantum limit , or when the inter - planar coupling becomes considerably smaller than the inter landau level separation ( e.g. in the vicinity of the yamaji angle ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the axial anomaly should be present in every three dimensional conducting system , upon approaching the quantum limit . </S>",
    "<S> explicit calculations indicate that the axial anomaly would only cause negative magnetoresistance for predominant forward scattering produced by ionic impurities  @xcite . as our experimental results show , pdcoo@xmath0 is a metal of extremely high conductivity thus necessarily dominated by small angle scattering processes and therefore satisfying the forward scattering criterion . in this metal </S>",
    "<S> the landau levels disperse periodically as shown in figs . 6**b * * and 6**c * * , depending on the relative strength of the cyclotron energy @xmath107 with respect to the inter - layer transfer integral @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the condition @xmath108 is satisfied when @xmath2 roughly exceeds 100 t. for this reason fig . 6**c * * , with multiple partially occupied landau levels , describes pdcoo@xmath0 for fields along the _ c_-axis or for arbitrary angles away from the yamaji ones . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , one can suppress the fermi points by aligning the field along an yamaji angle , and this should suppress the associated axial anomaly . as experimentally seen , the suppression of the fermi points suppresses the negative magnetoresistivity indicating that the axial anomaly might be responsible for it .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , in very clean layered metals we have uncovered a very clear correlation between the existence of fermi points in a one - dimensional dispersion and the observation of an anomalous negative magnetoresistivity . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of these points leads to the disappearance of this effect . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the axial anomaly , and related negative magnetoresistivity , would not be contingent upon the existence of an underlying three dimensional dirac / weyl dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> instead , our study in pdcoo@xmath0 , ptcoo@xmath0 and sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , which are clean metals with no dirac / weyl dispersion at zero magnetic field , indicates that the axial anomaly and its effects could be a generic feature of metal(s ) near the quantum limit . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the detection of _ negative _ magnetoresistivity would depend on the underlying scattering mechanisms , i.e. observable only in those compounds which are clean enough to be dominated by elastic forward scattering caused by ionic impurities  @xcite . in a generic metal with a high carrier density , it is currently impossible to reach the quantum limit ; for the available field strength many landau levels would be populated , thus producing a myriad of fermi points . in this </S>",
    "<S> regard , extremely pure layered metals such as ( pd , pt)coo@xmath0 are unique , since by just tilting the magnetic - field in the vicinity of the yamaji angle , one can achieve the condition of a single , partially filled landau level as it would happen at the quantum limit . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the observation in all three compounds , of a pronounced negative magnetoresistivity for fields and currents precisely aligned along the _ c_-axis is quite puzzling . </S>",
    "<S> this situation necessarily leads to the population of a multitude of fermi levels and , although it does not necessarily preclude a role for the axial anomaly , it does involve scattering among a number of fermi points at distinct landau levels . </S>",
    "<S> in such a situation the role of the anomaly is less clear . here , </S>",
    "<S> we limit ourselves at exposing the novelty and the apparent universality of our observations hoping to stimulate further theoretical developments . </S>"
