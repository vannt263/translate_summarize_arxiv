    "thinking to rh as an inverse problem @xcite we used experimental techniques to explore this idea and after some fruitless attempts involving dynamical systems we came across tauberian theory @xcite .",
    "it is also worth to mention there is an equivalence of rh in term of an inverse spectral problem @xcite confirming perhaps an intrinsic inverse nature of the problem .",
    "our starting point was this formula which is easy to prove    @xmath2    where @xmath3 denotes the liouville function ( a008836 in @xcite ) and @xmath4 counts the prime numbers with multiplicity in the factorisation of @xmath5 ( a001222 in @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , we suspect the square root appearing in the r.h.s . means something regarding the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath6 ( a002819 in @xcite ) .",
    "thus we made a first tauberian conjecture supported by few experiments .",
    "if @xmath7 is bounded then we claim      @xmath8@xmath9    in particular    @xmath10    which implies rh is true @xcite .",
    "shorlty after , g. tenenbaum @xcite showed that a weaker form of this conjecture , for positive functions , is equivalent to rh by mean of a tauberian theorem .",
    "i.e. , let @xmath11 then we get rh is true if and ony if @xmath12 and    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the summatory functions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "however our experimental results suggested much more was true and this tauberian approach to rh was investigated further making intensive experiments . instead of the above summation ( 1 ) involving directly the floor function we prefer to consider ingham summation process which involves the bounded function : @xmath0 .",
    "namely we say a sequence @xmath18 is @xmath19-summable to @xmath20 if :    @xmath21    this method was considered by many authors and some generalisations exist @xcite@xcite as well as relationship with the riemann hypothesis @xcite .",
    "unlike ingham we are mainly interested in the behaviour of the partial sum and not only in the convergence .",
    "so this study appears to be a new part of the tauberian remainder theory ( cf .",

    "here we consider bounded functions @xmath22 and we define a sequence @xmath23 for a given function @xmath16 by the recurrence formula :    @xmath24    next under some assumptions we try to give precise estimates for the behaviour of @xmath25 . although the liouville function was helpful for the intuition ( cf .",
    "conjecture above ) , we will consider also the moebius function .",

    "it is easy to see the conditions of the compensation conjecture are satisfied , thus we can say @xmath22 is a fgv of index @xmath291 .",

    "then we speculate @xmath22 is a fgv of type 2 and index @xmath43 so that the li conjecture would hold for all nontrivial zeros of @xmath312 .",
    "next letting @xmath313 and considering all sort of primitive @xmath1-functions having no positive real zeros and no pole at 1 we claim that all nontrivial zeros of @xmath233 and of all distinct primitive @xmath1-functions having no positive real zeros and no pole at 1 are linearly independant over @xmath314 .",
    "this is the gli conjecture ( the grand linear independance conjecture ) .",

    "however with this more general definition it seems not necessary to consider the zeta function for proving grh is true .",
    "for instance instead of considering @xmath289 we could take directly @xmath316 and still define :    * @xmath288    and then we expect that :    * @xmath317    is true and has similar consequences , i.e. , rh would be true for the @xmath318 function .",

    ".    then we claim @xmath156 and @xmath82 are fgv of index @xmath161 and @xmath326 respectively satisfying :    @xmath327    moreover we add that under the condition @xmath328 we have :    * @xmath156 is a fgv of type 2 @xmath329 is a fgv of type 2 .",
    "rh is true .",

    "so we fill the conditions of the comparison conjecture and thus @xmath82 is a fgv of unknown index @xmath326 satisfying :    @xmath333    in an other hand we have from the known relation @xmath334 and from fgv definition :    * @xmath335 for a slowly varying function @xmath1 .",
    "next from the functional equation of the @xmath233 function we have :    * @xmath336    thus we have necessarily :    @xmath337    thus the 2 above inequalities yield :    @xmath338    and consequently rh is true and the zeros are simple .",
    "moreover we add the li conjecture is true for the zeta function since @xmath82 would be a fgv of type 2 .",
    "this conjecture does nt work for proving rh is true for all @xmath1-function . for the beta function or the ramanujan tau function the condition",
    "@xmath325 is not satisfied .",
    "we conjecture that for each function @xmath339 in the selberg class @xcite having no positive real zero and no pole at 1 , letting @xmath340 , there is a fgv @xmath341 of index @xmath43 of type 2 and a function @xmath342 satisfying @xmath343 such that we have :    @xmath344    thus rh would be true for these functions .",
    "although we give speculative arguments for proving rh is true and extending the idea to grh , we give sometime asymptotic formula for @xmath83 using simple but nontrivial fgv .",
    "this shows fgv is a consistent concept and we have some confidence with this approach to rh since a general phenomenom exists . the weaker conjecture in 4.4.1 . where we propose to prove there are",
    "zero free region of type @xmath345 would be in its own an interesting result .",
    "we think the tool needed for solving the problem are not necessarily complicated and could stay within the realm of real analysis . more precisely if we try to use the method described in 2.2 . for @xmath27",
    "( keeping the same notations ) we get @xmath346 and @xmath347 is the laplace transform of @xmath348 which is not easy to handle . furthermore if we wish to got a formula using the simpler @xmath82 defined in section 4 we have to consider @xmath349 and it is complicated to find its inverse laplace transform and to have a practical formula .",
    "hence we believe laplace or laplace - stieltjes transform or related tools are not suitable for attacking our conjectures . in our mind",
    "the use of polynomial approximation like karamata breakthrough would be perhaps a better approach .",
    "we feel it is possible to formalize such a proof for one or more conjecture listed in this paper , specially for the smooth case in 2.5 or 2.6 . in the event that none of our conjectures would be right",
    "we think that slight changes could correct some ot them . as a matter of fact we did nt provide exemples of fgv having many changes of variations but there are plenty of such functions . for instance",
    "@xmath350 are clearly fgv for @xmath351 .",
    "thus the topic of fgv is much more larger than the focus of this study and in a forcoming paper we explore a wider class of fgv @xcite .",
