    "currently the search for gravitational radiation from astrophysical sources is conducted with the first - generation earth - based laser interferometers @xcite ( ligo in usa @xcite , virgo in italy @xcite , geo-600 in germany @xcite , tama-300 in japan @xcite and aciga in australia @xcite ) .",
    "the development of the second - generation gw detectors ( advanced ligo in usa @xcite , lcgt in japan @xcite ) is underway .",
    "the ultimate sensitivity of laser gravitational detectors ( as belonging to class of position meters ) is restricted by the standard quantum limit ( sql )  a specific sensitivity level where the measurement noise of the meter ( photon shot noise ) is equal to its back - action ( radiation pressure noise ) @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of gw detectors is also limited by a great amount of displacements noises of various nature : seismic and gravity - gradient noise at low frequencies ( below @xmath0 hz ) , thermal noise in suspensions , bulks and coatings of the mirrors ( @xmath1 hz ) .    recently s. kawamura and y. chen proclaimed idea of so called displacement - noise - free interferometer ( dfi ) which are free from displacement noise of the test masses as well as from optical laser noise @xcite",
    ". the most attractive feature of dfi is the straightforward overcoming of the sql ( since radiation pressure noise is canceled ) without the need of implementation of very complicated and vulnerable schemes for quantum - non - demolition ( qnd ) measurements @xcite .",
    "the possibility of gw signal separation from displacement noise of the test masses is based on the the _ distributed _ interaction of gws with a laser interferometer in contrast with localized influence of mirrors positions on the light wave only in the moments of reflection .",
    "the `` payment '' for such separation is decrease of gw response . in particular , the analysis presented in @xcite showed that the sensitivity to gws at low frequencies ( so called long wave length approximation @xmath2 or @xmath3 ( @xmath4 it",
    "time of light trip between test masses separated by distance @xmath5 , @xmath6 is wave length and @xmath7 is mean frequency of gravitational wave ) turns out to be limited by the @xmath8-factor for 3d ( space - based ) configurations and @xmath9-factor for 2d ( ground - based ) configurations .",
    "for the signals around @xmath10 hz and @xmath11 km ( @xmath12  s ) , the dfi sensitivity of the ground - based detector is @xmath13 times worse than the one of the conventional michelson interferometer ( i.e. a single round - trip detector ) .",
    "the proposed mz - based configurations could be modified with power- and signal - recycling mirrors , artificial time - delay devices @xcite , but nevertheless , the potentially achievable sensitivity remains incomparable with conventional non - dfi detectors .",
    "another approach to the displacement noise cancellation was presented in @xcite where a single detuned fabry - perot ( fp ) cavity pumped through both of its movable , partially transparent mirrors was analyzed .    in this paper",
    "we investigate model originated from a simple toy model @xcite of the gw detector .",
    "our model consists of two double pumped fabry - perot cavities positioned in line .",
    "each cavity is pumped through both partially transparent mirrors . by properly combining the signals of output ports of the cavity",
    "an experimenter can remove the information about the fluctuations of the mirrors displacements and laser noise from the data .",
    "the `` payment '' for isolation of the gw signal from displacement noise in our case is the suppression of sensitivity by factor of @xmath8 ( resonance gain partially compensates it ) as compared with conventional interferometers  it is larger than limiting factor @xmath14 of the double mach - zehnder 2d configuration @xcite .",

    "[ sec_2fp_cavities ] we analyze configuration of two double - pumped fabry - perot cavities . finally in sec . [ conclusion ] we discuss the physical meaning of the obtained results and briefly outline the further prospects .",

    "gw propagates perpendicularly to this line .",
    "we assume that lasers , detectors and mirrors are rigidly mounted on each platform which , in turn , can move as a free masses .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case when radiation emitted from the laser on some platform is registered ( after reflection ) by detector on the same platform  so called round trip configuration",
    ". actually detectors are homodyne detectors measuring the phase of incident wave .    strictly speaking , in order to describe detection of light wave we have to work in the reference frame of detector , i.e. in accelerated frame .",
    "however , in our model detector is mounted on the same platform as laser which radiation detector registers and we can work in inertial laboratory frame as it was demonstrated in @xcite .",
