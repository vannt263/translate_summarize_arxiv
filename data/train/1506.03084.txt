    "in the local universe massive galaxies are characterized by having a dominant early - type , bulge - dominated morphology as well as old stellar populations .",
    "they are also confined to tight scaling relations , such as the mass - size relation ( e.g. @xcite ) and the fundamental plane . understanding the formation and subsequent mass assembly of such systems is however still debated in present - day cosmology and it is a key milestone towards reaching a complete view of structure formation and the interplay between baryons and their dark - matter hosts . in particular , the actual role played by mergers as compared to in - situ processes in shaping spheroids is still unclear , and state - of - the - art semi - analytic models of galaxy formation offer sometimes quite different views ( e.g. , @xcite )    following the scaling relations of these massive objects across cosmic time is a natural way to better understand how the relations actually emerged and the role played at different cosmic epochs by the different physical mechanisms . as a matter of fact",
    ", many works in the last ten years have focused their attention on the evolution of the mass - size relation for a selection of massive galaxies ( @xmath24 ) finding an apparent increase of the zero point of the relation by a factor of a few from @xmath2 ( e.g  @xcite ) without significant changes in the slope ( e.g.  @xcite ) or the scatter @xcite .",
    "properly interpreting these redshift - dependent evolutionary trends as a progenitor - descendant relation remains still elusive given the continuous mass build - up ( e.g. ) , the morphological transformations ( e.g.  @xcite ) and the evolution of the stellar populations ( e.g  @xcite ) which make galaxies coming in and out of any given selection ( _ progenitor bias _ effect , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "as a matter of fact , a selection done at fixed stellar mass as usually done in several works , will necessarily be _ contaminated _ by galaxies which grow in mass that will enter any given stellar mass bin .",
    "the level of contamination depends on the stellar mass selection . for massive galaxies ( @xmath25 ) , the fraction of galaxies in the lowest redshift bin which are actually descendants of the galaxies at higher redshift ( @xmath26 ) is less than 20% @xcite .",
    "therefore establishing evolutionary links is not straightforward at all .",
    "the situation is even worse when passive galaxies are to be considered since quenching and mass growth both contribute to this progenitor bias effect .",
    "one popular solution has been to study the evolution of the number density of these compact objects ( e.g. @xcite ) , but the results are not always in agreement , specially at low redshifts where hst surveys probe a small area and also because of the multiple available definitions of _ compact galaxies_. as a matter of fact , some works do select only the most massive galaxies ( @xmath27 , e.g. @xcite ) while others select a wider stellar mass bin ( @xmath28 , e.g @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there are papers using a fixed size threshold ( a straight line in the mass - size plane , e.g. @xcite ) while others prefer a selection according to the slope of the mass - size relation ( e.g @xcite ) . on top of this , other parameters that could bias the results are environment and also the passive selection criteria ( e.g @xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "several authors do find a steep decrease of their abundances ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) while others tend to find a rather constant number ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another option has been proposed based on selecting galaxies at fixed number density ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , i.e. assuming the rank order is preserved at all epochs .",
    "this approach also implies some important assumptions such as neglecting the role of mergers or the scatter in the mass accretion histories and it is faced to the known uncertainties in the evolution of the massive end of the mass function ( e.g.  @xcite ) and the continuous quenching happening at all cosmic epochs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the latter approach can still provide some broad insights into the expected , average mass - growth of galaxies , thus allowing for a basic technique to observationally relate progenitors and descendants .",
    "moreover , the methodology has now been improved by including corrections to the redshift - dependent number densities to account for mergers @xcite based on abundance matching .",
    "it was also recently stressed that differences in the stellar mass function lead to consistent results for the mass growth within @xmath29 dex , at least for galaxies with @xmath30 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "globally , these empirical studies based on number conservation procedures tend to agree on a significant structural evolution , and confirm an important size growth of the average population .",
    "the growth seems to be driven by the addition of material in the outskirts of the galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) in what has been called an inside - out growth and interpreted as a minor merger driven growth through the tidal disruption of small companions falling into the central galaxy ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "despite the outstanding efforts made so far , it is still challenging to properly follow the evolutionary tracks of especially the most massive galaxies .",
    "number conservation - based approaches map today s red and dead early - type systems to _ progenitors _ presenting a variety of morphologies and star - formation activities ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus very difficult to interpret the evolution of the overall population as a unique physical mechanism since multiple processes , such as morphological transformations or quenching can clearly contribute to move galaxies in the mass - size plane from one redshift bin to another .    by simultaneously following the evolution of the star formation activity ( quenching ) , morphological transformations , and mass build - up along the progenitor tracks identified through number - conserving techniques , one should be able to ideally separate the different contributors to the average structural evolution .",
    "all previous works lack however of a precise quantification of how the morphologies change and evolve among the progenitors of massive galaxies , mainly .",
    "the most significant effort has been probably done by  @xcite who made bulge - to - disk decompositions but just on one candels field ( uds ) and without quantification of irregularities .",
    "another noticeable effort has been carried out by @xcite , who in the same uds candels field visually classified galaxies into discs , ellipticals and peculiar systems .",
    "they found significant evolution in the fractions of galaxies at a given visual classification as a function of redshift , though they did not attempt to trace evolutionary tracks among galaxies at different epochs .",
    "this is therefore the main new ingredient which motivates the present paper , in which we bring into the puzzle of massive galaxy formation detailed _ visual _ like morphologies for a large sample of galaxies from all the five candels fields .",
    "combined with accurate stellar - masses and rest - frame colors as well as optical rest - frame structural parameters from the 3d - hst  @xcite and candels  @xcite surveys , we revisit the evolutionary tracks of massive galaxies from @xmath2 .",
    "the paper proceeds as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : dataset ] , we describe the dataset used as well as the main physical parameters derived ( morphologies , structural parameters , sfrs etc .. ) . in    [ sec : nd ] we describe the procedure to select the main progenitors and from    [ sec : morpho_evol ] to    [ sec : struct ] we describe the main results , namely the evolution of the morphologies , structures and star - formation properties .",
    "these results are discussed in    [ sec : disc ] and we provide a summary in    [ sec : summ ] .    throughout the paper , we adopt a flat cosmology with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath34 and we use magnitudes in the ab system .",
    "we select all galaxies in the f160w filter with f160w@xmath3524.5  mag ( ab ) in the 5 candels fields ( uds , cosmos , egs , goods - s , goods - n ) .",
    "our starting - point catalogs are the candels public photometric catalogs for uds @xcite and goods - s @xcite and preliminary candels catalogs were used for cosmos , egs and goods - n ( private communication ) .",
    "the magnitude cut is required to ensure reliable visual morphologies @xcite and structural parameters @xcite which are two key ingredients for the analysis presented in this work . as discussed in @xcite , the magnitude cut results in a reasonable mass completeness of @xmath36 at @xmath2 which is well beyond the mass limit required to follow the progenitors of massive galaxies as discussed in the following .",
    "our results should thus not be significantly affected by incompleteness .",

    "morphologies are estimated using convnets , a specific artificial neural network topology that is inspired by the biological visual cortex ( e.g.  @xcite ) which is by far the most powerful image classifier up to date . when used for image recognition ,",
    "convolutional neural networks consist of multiple layers of small neuron collections which look at small portions of the input image , also called receptive fields .",

    "are somehow arbitrary but have been calibrated through visual inspection to make sure that they result in different morphological classes ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that slight changes on the thresholds used to define the classes do not affect the main results of the paper .",
    "figure  [ fig : stamps ] shows some examples of the morphological classes defined that way .",
    "the sph class contains galaxies fully dominated by the bulge component with little or no disk at all .",
    "the disk class is made of galaxies in which the disk component dominates over the bulge . between both classes , lies the disksph class in which we put galaxies with no clear dominant component .",
    "then we distinguish 2 types of irregulars : diskirr , i.e. disk dominated galaxies with some asymmetric features and irr , which are irregular galaxies with no clear dominant disk component ( including mergers ) .",
    "these two last categories do contain all the variety of irregular systems usually observed in the high redshift universe ( e.g. clumpy , chain , taphole etc .. ) .",
    "the separation between the last 2 classes is however challenging ( even for the human eye ) , since a diffuse light component can be easily interpreted as a disk . therefore , even though we will consider the 2 classes separately in most of the plots , the reader should keep in mind that there can be significant overlap .",
    "for the galaxies selected in this work ( see section  [ sec : nd ] ) , @xmath51 of the population fits in one of the 5 defined classes .",
    "the remaining @xmath52 contains either galaxies with rather high irregular , spheroid and disk morphologies simultaneously or unclassifiable objects .",
    "+      photometric redshifts , stellar masses and star formation rates ( sfrs ) are estimated from sed modeling as described in previous works by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we describe here the basic procedure and refer the reader to these works for more details .",
    "photometric redshifts are estimated from a variety of different codes available in the literature which are then combined to improve the individual performance .",
    "the technique is fully described in @xcite .",
    "based on the best available redshifts ( spectroscopic or photometric ) we then estimate stellar masses and uv - based sfrs using fast @xcite assuming @xcite models , a @xcite imf , solar metallicity , exponentially declining star formation histories , and a @xcite extinction law .",

    "single sersic 2d fits were performed to galaxies in candels in the three infrared filters ( f105,f125,f160 ) using galfit  @xcite .",
    "the typical uncertainty on the parameters is less than @xmath6 for the magnitude cut applied in this work as clearly shown in  @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed however that the total light profiles and sizes of massive galaxies at @xmath0 can significantly be affected by the background estimates .",
    "we do not expect a major impact of this effect in our sample at higher redshift though , where the contribution of the diffuse light around massive galaxies is less important .",
    "@xcite applied some corrections to the effective radii of passive and star - forming galaxies to measure them in a unique rest - frame band of @xmath54 .",
    "given that the corrections are very small and have little effect on the final measured structural evolution as discussed in the aforementioned work , we use here for simplicity the closest filter to the optical rest - frame band as done by @xcite .",
    "one key issue when one tries to infer the evolution of individual galaxies is to actually link progenitors and descendants without being strongly affected by progenitor bias ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the stellar mass function ( smf ) is known to significantly evolve from @xmath55 ( e.g. ) so a selection at fixed stellar mass will clearly be affected by new galaxies kicking in at lower redshifts as widely discussed in the recent literature .",
    "also , a selection of only passive galaxies will be affected by the continuous quenching at all cosmic epochs .",
    "an alternative which is rapidly becoming very popular in the community is a selection at fixed number density ( e.g. @xcite ) . at first level",
    ", this selection assumes that the ranking of galaxies is preserved at all redshifts and therefore deliberately ignores the impact of mergers and the scatter in the mass accretion histories  @xcite which can lead to errors in the stellar mass growth of @xmath56 dex ( see also @xcite for a comparison with sam predictions leading to similar conclusions ) . to overcome this issue , @xcite used abundance matching techniques to track the evolution of galaxies within their dark - matter haloes and apply a correction to this simple assumption .",
    "the model therefore accounts for number density evolution and is the one adopted in this work .",
    "figure  [ fig : tracks ] shows the stellar mass growth track for the progenitors of @xmath57 galaxies from @xmath58 from the @xcite model , assuming the stellar mass functions ( smfs ) of @xcite .",
    "as recently shown by @xcite , using different abundance matching assumptions ( e.g. @xcite ) or different measured smfs , leads to consistent results for the mass growth within @xmath29 dex .",
    "the figure confirms that massive galaxies grow by a factor of 2 in stellar mass from @xmath26 and a factor of @xmath59 from @xmath2 , so that the typical stellar mass of the progenitors of @xmath60 galaxies is @xmath61 at @xmath2 and @xmath62 at @xmath58 .",
    "this mass growth track includes mergers , which occur at a rate of @xmath63 major ( 1:4 ) mergers / galaxy between @xmath2 and @xmath64 ( see section  [ sec : mergers ] for a detailed discussion on the effect of mergers ) .",
    "since our sample is mass complete down to @xmath65 from @xmath2 , a selection along the progenitors should not be affected by incompleteness . as described in @xcite , we select galaxies along the growth track by picking galaxies in a given redshift bin within a narrow stellar mass bin of @xmath66 dex around the corresponding mass for that redshift . as also discussed in @xcite , this stellar mass bin is a reasonable trade off to account for the different predictions of different methods / smfs and the scatter in the mass accretion histories .",

    "irregular disks have very low n values ( @xmath110 ) while disk and disk+spheroids have rather constant intermediate values with ( @xmath107 for disks and @xmath111 for disk+sph ) .",
    "this also confirms the validity of our morphological classification . considering all these trends ,",
    "the average observed increase of the sersic index ( black line in figure  [ fig : med_props ] ) is again better explained as a combination of morphological transformations from clumpy disks to regular systems which produces a growth of the bulge and an increase of the sersic index together with the _ individual _ increase of spheroids .",
    "the general increase of the sersic index is also observed by @xcite and might help to explain part of the evolution in the lensing profile of early - type galaxies .",
    "axis ratios show little evolution with redshift but the absolute values change significantly with the morphological type .",
    "spheroids have @xmath112 values close to 0.8 while all the other morphological classes present values of @xmath113 , which again suggests that there are two families of objects following different evolutions .",
    "the measured values are also in good agreement with measurements in the local universe for similar morphologies @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mass_profiles ] we analyze the total mass density profiles for different morphologies . as also done in @xcite ,",
    "we compute the median mass density profile using the best fit sersic models at different redshifts and convert them to stellar masses by normalizing by the stellar mass of each galaxy ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "this procedure is clearly a first order approximation since it neglects any gradient in the stellar populations which could definitely modify the shape of the profiles ( specially for the star forming galaxies ) .",
    "the figure clearly shows that spheroids are rapidly increasing their size at a faster rate than the average ( bottom panel ) with most of the action happening towards the galaxy outskirts through the addition of material .",
    "the central parts remain unaltered from @xmath2 ( changes in the inner @xmath114 kpc would not be detected given the psf size ) .",
    "the evolution of the mass density profile for disks and disk+spheroids is less dramatic , resulting in a milder increase of their size , but the changes happen also at radii larger than @xmath115 kpc .",
    "interestingly , the clumpy - disks do show a significant evolution of their profile which could be interpreted as gas accretion happening in these objects and bringing material to the outskirts .",
    "these trends should however be taken with caution , specially for the star forming population , since firstly we neglect any stellar population gradient by construction when building the stacked mass profiles and secondly the profiles are obtained through single component fits which might not be well adapted to reproduce the irregular light distribution of clumpy galaxies .",

    "otherwise , we would expect an increase of their abundance , since it is very unlikely that these galaxies will transform into another morphological class ( although this can not be fully excluded as discussed in section  [ sec : mergers ] ) .",
    "an independent test for this statement would be a detailed analysis of the stellar population ages for this particular population which will be addressed in forthcoming work with higher resolution seds .",
    "recall , that the size growth is even larger than the one measured for the overall population ( i.e. factor of 2 - 3 ) which is in fact a convolution of different mechanisms as described below .",
    "the properties of these galaxies are therefore consistent with a formation of the bulk of their stellar populations at high redshifts through violent disk instabilities or gas rich mergers ( at @xmath10 their gas fraction is high and also their ssfr ) which created their dense cores @xcite and a subsequent growth by the addition of material in the outskirts through , possibly , minor mergers .",
    "figure  [ fig : summary_plot ] summarizes the inferred evolution of these objects in the mass - size and @xmath125-sfr planes from @xmath2 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing , that the size growth for these objects at later epochs ( @xmath3 ) is still very pronounced , i.e. a factor of @xmath101 with a minimum stellar mass growth .",
    "the global trend is nevertheless still compatible , at first order , with a minor merger driven growth as predicted by numerical and semi - empirical models ( e.g. @xcite for slightly larger stellar masses ) .",
    "a more detailed comparison with the models predictions is however required at this stage .",
    "the remaining @xmath79 of the population is made of irregular / clumpy disks at @xmath2 which experience a rapid morphological transformation between @xmath81 and @xmath126 to give birth to very massive disks with a small bulge ( @xmath84 ) and to @xmath127 of galaxies with both a prominent bulge and a disk component .",
    "the evolution of the effective radii is more moderate than for spheroids and scales roughly with @xmath23 , the expected growth of disks in dm haloes .",
    "figure  [ fig : summary_plot ] summarizes the inferred evolution of these objects in the mass - size and @xmath125-sfr planes from @xmath2 .",
    "the transition between the clumpy - irregular morphologies to more hubble sequence like galaxies happens mostly at @xmath18 .",
    "clumpy - irregular disks are characterized by high sfrs ( @xmath90 , slightly above the main - sequence at that epoch ) , high gas - fractions ( @xmath79 ) and low sersic indices ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "some of these objects ( @xmath128 ) will experience a smooth transition to become massive spirals with low b / t fractions . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the properties of both families are very similar , in terms of gas fractions , sersic index , sfrs and also effective radii .",
    "the other @xmath129 will build a more prominent bulge ( @xmath130 ) which roughly correspond to b / t of 50%-75% @xcite . the building - up of a larger bulge component results in a decrease of the effective radius following the concentration of mass towards the central regions .",
    "the emergence of the bulge is also tightly correlated with the decrease of the star formation activity and the decrease of the gas fractions which go from @xmath5 to @xmath95 , which make them depart from the star - formation main sequence ( fig .  [",
    "fig : summary_plot ] ) .",
    "this evolution is consistent with the predictions of several numerical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) which show how the growth of a bulge through clump migration is followed by a decrease of the star - formation activity ( _ morphological quenching _ ) although the effect of feedback from a smbh in the growing bulge could also produce similar effects . as a matter of fact",
    ", agn feedback is known to contribute to the quenching of star formation ( e.g. , ) and it is also known to correlate with the mass of the bulge ( e.g. , ) and therefore could also help explaining the quenching of bulge+disk systems which seems to be associated with the growth of the bulge .",
    "this 2 track - scenario is obviously not the only possible explanation for the trends we observe .",
    "namely , the constant number of spheroids could also be a result of clumpy gas rich galaxies being transformed into spheroids following a major merger event and spheroids regrowing a disk at the same rate ( e.g. ) .",
    "since the inferred gas fractions of irregular systems is high ( @xmath97 ) , this is a plausible option .",
    "the scenario requires however a fine - tuning to keep these two effects ( formation of spheroids and disk regrowth ) at the same rate and also a high ( major ) merger fraction to keep producing spheroids .",
    "there have been several measurements of the major merger rate ( 1:4 ) of massive galaxies ( @xmath131 ) in the recent literature . from the observational point of view ,",
    "@xcite measure 1.6 mergers / galaxy between @xmath132 ( extrapolating the quoted redshift evolution ) .",
    "this is in rather good agreement with @xcite who find 1.1 mergers / galaxy in the same period and also with .",
    "@xcite find a larger fraction ( 1.7 mergers / galaxy only between @xmath133 and @xmath81 ) .",
    "abundance matching based measurements ( e.g. @xcite ) also find similar numbers ( 1.7 mergers / galaxy between @xmath134 and @xmath81 ) , just as sams ( e.g.  @xcite ) and numerical simulations ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in this work we use the @xcite model , which predicts @xmath135 major mergers / galaxy along the mass growth track shown in figure  [ fig : tracks ] .",
    "considering these different measurements , it is certainly safe to assume that , on average , each galaxy in our sample experiences a major merger event in the redshift range explored . assuming then that each merger event is enough to change the morphology",
    ", it is indeed possible to explain the number density decrease of irregular disks by mergers followed by disk rebuilding .",
    "we notice however that the @xcite simulations focusing on disk rebuilding , predict that only equal mass mergers are able to create bulge dominated systems .",
    "lower mass ration mergers ( 1:2 - 1:4 ) tend to create disk dominated systems which continue forming stars . in that respect ,",
    "if mergers+disk rebuilding is the dominant channel , we would expect at all epochs an increasing fraction of star - forming regular disks and a minor fraction of quiescent bulge - dominated systems .",
    "the opposite is actually observed .",
    "in addition to this , we do observe that the median ages of the spheroids in our sample estimated through sed fitting , monolithically increase from @xmath1360.5 gyrs at @xmath89 to @xmath1362.5 gyr at @xmath64 ( roughly consistent with the time between these 2 redshift bins ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the ages of disks dominated systems tend to stay rather young ( @xmath137 ) at all epochs due to the sustained star formation .",
    "if the dominant process to create the @xmath4 spheroids we observe is merging , we would not expect a strong increase of the ages of spheroids which we actually seem to observe . given the known degeneracies affecting age determination from broad band photometry",
    ", these trends need to be taken with caution",
    ". however they point towards an early formation of the spheroid population",

    "when inspected at fixed visual morphology the trends are very different .",
    "the quiescent fraction in the spheroid population is already high at @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath17 and increases to an almost @xmath121 value .",
    "the quiescent fraction for disks and disk irregulars remains low ( @xmath141 ) at all epochs while for bulge+disk objects the fraction appears to be constant too at a value of @xmath142 .",
    "these trends suggest that the overall increase of the quenching fraction for the whole population can be explained by a combination of the quenching of the spheroid population with the morphological transformation from clumpy / irregular disk to early - spiral / s0 . *",

    "the evolution of the average size seems to have 2 different regimes , from @xmath2 to @xmath102 , there is almost no significant change of the effective radius while the bulk of the growth happens from @xmath102 to @xmath0 . at fixed morphologies",

    "the other hand , irregular disks and disks grow by a factor of @xmath105 and keep a rather constant sersic index ( @xmath145 for disks and disk+irr ) and @xmath111 for disk+bulge galaxies .",
    "the two different phases in the average growth are better explained if morphological transformations are taken into account . in the first phase",
    ", there is a rapid morphological transformation from clumpy disks to bulge+disk galaxies which results in a slight decrease of the effective radius as a consequence of the mass concentration towards the inner regions of the galaxy .",
    "even though , spheroids and clumpy disks increase their size in this period , the rapid decrease of the number density of the latter seems to compensate this growth and results in no evolution of the average size . during the second phase , from @xmath102 , the morphological",
    "mixing remains roughly constant , but the size growth increases by a factor of @xmath146 on average .",
    "this growth is therefore better explained by the individual growth of disk / disk+bulge galaxies which grow by a factor of @xmath105 and the growth of the spheroids which increase their effective radius by a factor of @xmath147",
    ".      1 .   a _ nugget _ track ( fast assembly ) followed by @xmath148 of the population of massive galaxies .",
    "galaxies formed that way , formed the bulk of the stars at @xmath78 and also acquired their spheroidal morphology at these early epochs possible through violent disk instabilities ( and/or mergers ) which rapidly bring gas into the central parts . at @xmath149",

    "the morphological transformation is accompanied by a decrease of the sfr ( reaching @xmath152 ) and the gas fraction ( going down to @xmath140 ) , more dramatic for galaxies developing a larger bugle as well as by an increase of the sersic index ( from @xmath110 to @xmath111 ) and a decrease of the effective radius because of the mass being concentrated towards the inner regions .",
    "this is in good agreement with the predictions of numerical simulations in which the bulge component is built from the migration of clumps and the stabilization of the disk results in a decrease of the star formation rate ( _ morphological quenching _ ) although the possible effect of a smbh should also be considered .",
