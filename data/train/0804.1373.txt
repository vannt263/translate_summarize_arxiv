    "new round of studies last year focused on this issue , using the so called second order formalism , which includes viscosity and relaxation time parameters on top of ideal hydro .",
    "p. and u.romatschke @xcite were first , and they found that the best fits to @xmath3 is at @xmath4 , smaller than the famous ads / cft result @xcite @xmath5 .",
    "small viscosity effects in flow were also found by teaney and dusling @xcite and by chaudhuri ( see his talk here ) : with tensor correction at the freezout time dominating @xmath3 as teaney originally suggested .",
    "d.molnar ( see his talk here ) have demonstrated nice agreement between cascades and hydro for @xmath3 , provided cross sections / viscosity are appropriately tuned .",
    "( song and heinz  see talk here  found for some reason larger viscous corrections to flow . )    now , is the accuracy level really allows us to extract @xmath6 ?",
    "the uncertainties in initial state deformation are at the 10% level ( see venugopalan s talk ) , thus comparable to the viscosity effect .",
    "eos can probably be constrained better ( lattice ? ) .",
    "i think uncertainties related to freezeout  not yet discussed at all  can also be reduced down to few percent level , provided more efforts to understand hadronic resonances / interactions at the hadronic stage will be made . at the moment",
    "a safe statement is @xmath7 and below .2 or so : while the exact value is still lacking .",
    "( such as @xcite ) : while the correlation functions themselves are quite accurate , the spectral density is obtained by rather arbitrary choice between many excellent possible fits . ]",
    "can viscosity be even smaller , @xmath8 ?",
    "in fact , as lublinsky and myself @xcite discussed , the ads / cft gravity spectral densities predicts that effective momentum - dependent viscosity @xmath9 is @xmath10 with momentum k , from its famous value @xmath11 at k=0 .",
    "we do nt understand its physics : but if so this is very important at very early stages , for most peripheral collisions ( thin almond ) , affecting the famous @xmath12 curves on which hydro results are heavily based .",

    "liao and myself @xcite proposed a new view on sqgp , based on electric - magnetic duality / competition , see liao s talk and also works by zakharov et al @xcite .",
    "as dirac famously shown , quantum mechanics demands that electric and magnetic coupling constants are related by the celebrated quantization condition , which in quantum field theory setting require them to run in the @xmath13 directions : @xmath14 thus when @xmath15 is small ( at high t ) , @xmath16 should be strong .",
    "as @xmath17 decreases toward @xmath18 , electric one decrease and magnetic one grows , till monopoles take over quarks and gluons : see schematic phase diagram shown in fig.[fig_em_phasediag](a ) .",
    "recent lattice data @xcite provided dramatic conformation of this scenario .",
    "fig.[fig_em_phasediag](b ) shows two sets of these data , and the correlation ( and thus magnetic coupling ) is indeed stronger at @xmath19 @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , the correlation function for 50 - 50 mix of electric / magnetic plasma obtained in our molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation fig.[fig_em_phasediag](c ) has the same shape and magnitude , provided one compare at the same value of the magnetic plasma parameter @xmath20 : its extracted values are shown in fig.[fig_em_phasediag](d ) .",
    "it is very nice to find always @xmath21 , which means that magnetic component of sqgp is also liquid not gas , thus it does not spoil the `` perfect liquid '' at rhic .",
    "one may further think that viscosity has a minimum where both electric quasiparticles ( quarks ) and magnetically ones ( monopoles ) have similar difficulty propagating .",

    "( rajagopal s talk here may have some ) , i will provide some `` intuitive picture '' for non - experts .",

    "the upper rectangle is the 3-dimensional space boundary z=0 ( only 2 dim shown ) , which is flat ( minkowskian ) and corresponds to `` our world '' where the gauge theory lives .",

    "studies of conformal plasma famously started from evaluation of the bekenstein entropy @xcite , @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the black patch @xmath38 .",
    "( for non - experts : this setting can be seen as a swimming pool , with our gauge theory living on its surface , @xmath39 , at the desired temperature @xmath17 .",
    "while pool s bottom is @xmath40 hot , strong gravity stabilizes this setting , even thermodynamically . )",
    "fig.[fig_relaxation](a ) shows a setting of heavy quark quenching @xcite : a quark is being dragged ( at some hight @xmath41 related to the quark mass ) by an `` invisible hand '' ( to the left ) : its electric flux goes into the 5-th dimension , into the so called `` trailing string '' .",
    "its weight forces it to fall to the bottom ( horizon ) .",
    "( think of a heavy quark as a ship diligently laying underwater cable to the pool s bottom . )",
    "the cost of that is the drag @xmath42 connected to the diffusion constant via einstein relation , a nontrivial successful check on two very different calculations .",
    "another form of relaxation is studied via propagating `` bulk waves '' ( b ) : massless ones may have spin s=0 ( dilaton / axion),1(vector ) or 2 ( gravitons ) .",
    "absorptive boundary condition at the horizon ( black bottom)leads to spectra of `` quasinormal modes '' with the imaginary part @xmath43 , setting the dissipation timescale of various fluctuations .",
    "an exceptional case s=2 has two near - zero modes , corresponding to only two propagating `` surface waves '' , the longitudinal sound and transverse `` diffuson '' .",
    "absorption at the bottom ( horizon ) of both famously gives the viscosity @xmath5@xcite .",
    "the waves may have real ( timelike ) 4-momentum or virtual ( spacelike ) one .",
    "rather complete spectra of quasinormal modes and spectral densities for s=0,1,2 correlators are available , unfortunately extracted numerically .",
    "the case ( c )  a `` falling stone ''  perhaps represent colorless ( no strings attached ) `` mesons '' , released to plasma and relaxing .",
    "the dashed lines in fig.[fig_relaxation ] corresponds to the next - order diagram , describing back reaction of the falling bulk objects onto the boundary , the observation point denoted by a small open circle .",
    "this fields may also have spins 0,1 or 2 , providing 3 pictures known as a ( 4-d ) `` holograms '' of the bulk .",
    "contrary to our intuition ( developed from our limited flat - world experience ) , the hologram is @xmath44 a reduced reflection of more complete 5-d dynamics in the bulk , but in fact represents it fully .",
    "this phenomenon  the ads / cft duality  is a miracle occurring due to near - black - hole setting .",
    "these holographic images are what the surface observer will see .",
    "image of the trailing string was calculated in @xcite : the recent example at nonzero @xmath17 is shown in fig.[fig_holog](b , c ) : it accurately displays hydro conical flow . for a hologram of the stone fig.[fig_relaxation](c ) see recent paper @xcite : but to our knowledge the holographic `` back reaction '' of the falling waves remains to be done .    how these predictions are related to experiment ?",
    "apart of those shown in fig.[fig_vis_d_mapping ] , important test is whether the drag force indeed depends only on the @xmath45 ( rather than momentum ) : can be done via single electrons from @xmath46 and @xmath1 decays .",
    "another challenge is to test if the effective viscosity is indeed @xmath10 with increasing gradients as ads / cft nontrivially indicate @xcite : it can be inferred from elliptic flow at more peripheral collisions ( thinner `` almond '' ) .",

    "new challenging frontier is ads / cft _ out of equilibrium _ , addressing initial equilibration and entropy production . as explained in venugopalan s talks , _",
    "`` glasma '' _ is a non - equilibrium gluonic state between the collision moment and equilibrated qgp , which so far is modeled by random glue via classical yang - mills eqn in @xmath49 coupling .",
    "however the corresponding `` saturation scale '' @xmath50 at rhic is only about 1 - 1.5 gev  not far from parton momenta in sqgp , the perfect liquid as one knows ",
    "so one may wander if a @xmath51 coupled regime should be tried instead .",
    "this is what i propose to call sglasma frontier : ads / cft is the tool to use .",
    "it means that one has to start with high energy collision inside cold @xmath52 @xmath53 ( the vacuum , or a @xmath54 pool ) and then dynamically solve two difficult problems : ( i ) explain why `` collision debris '' may act like a `` heater '' imitating black / hot patch of fig.[fig_relaxation ] ; ( ii ) find a consistent solution with `` falling bottom '' , @xmath55 , and find its hologram describing hydro explosion / cooling .",
    "example of recent progress on the former ( i ) front are works by s.lin and myself @xcite and more recently by hofman and maldacena@xcite .",
    "one may view them as steps toward a `` strongly coupled collider physics '' , with a @xmath57 pair of heavy quarks jets produced . like in lund model ( pythia ) ,",
    "they are connected by a flux tube ( string ) , which is however not breaking but rather falling into the 5-th @xmath58 direction , fig.[fig_membranes](a ) . for",
    "one string one can both solve eqns of falling and then find its ( gravitational ) hologram @xcite .",
    "the result is an explosion shown in fig.[fig_holo](a ) , which is however _ non - thermal and thus non - hydrodynamical_.    temperature / entropy only appear when a horizon ( also called `` trapped surface '' ) is dynamically created leading to the information loss .",
    "a lot of work was done on gravitational collapse , there are black holes in the universe and , with modified multidimensional gravity , people are thinking about their possible formation in lhc experiments .",
    "however , in ads / cft language we are sure that @xmath59 rhic heavy ion collision event does produce a black hole , but with an effective gravity ( imitating qcd ) in the imaginary ( unreal ) 5-th dimension . in heavy ion context , sin , zahed and",
    "myself  @xcite first argued that exploding / cooling fireball on the brane is dual to @xmath60 black hole , formed by the collision debris and then falling toward the ads center .",
    "a specific solution they discussed in the paper was a brane departing from a static black hole , which generated a `` spherical '' solution ( no dependence on all 3 spatial coordinates ) with a time - dependent @xmath17 ( which however is more appropriate for cosmology but not heavy ion applications ) .",
    "these authors also discussed other idealized settings , with d - dimensional stretching , corresponding for d=1 to a collision of two infinite thin walls and subsequent bjorken rapidity - independent expansion , with 2d and 3d corresponding to cylindrical and spherical relativistic collapsing walls .    instead of solving einstein equations with certain source , describing gravitationally collapsing `` debris '' of the collision , janik and peschanski @xcite applied an `` inverse logic '' , extrapolating into the bulk the metric which yield expected hydrodynamical solution at the boundary .",
    "they found asymptotic ( late - time ) solution corresponding to 1 + 1-dim rapidity - independent bjorken expansion .",
    "it indeed has a departing @xmath61 at @xmath62 .",
    "important feature of this leading order solution is that while the horizon is stretching in one direction it is contracting in others keeping the total horizon area constant : this is entropy conservation .",
    "the first subleading terms @xmath63 has been calculated by sin and nakamura @xcite who identified them with the viscosity effects , although the viscosity value was only fixed by still further term by janik et al .",
    "however they eventually concluded @xcite that the expansion series are inconsistent beyond the first few orders .",
    "i always argued this should be the case : a near - horizon singularity which they see as a problem just shows inevitability of the matter presence : pure gravity simply is not enough .",
    "further work toward working out a `` gravity dual '' to heavy ion fireball is ongoing : let me show just a sketch of our current work .",
    "if many strings are falling together their combined gravity is non - negligible  they are partly folling under their own weight .",
    "so one should solve non  linearized einstein eqns , which tell us that ( from the viewpoint of distant observer ) extra weight may actually slow down falling , eventually leading to near - horizon levitation .",
    "the trapped surface is moving first upward ( shown at the bottom of fig.[fig_membranes](b ) ) toward the falling membrane , till two collide , get close and fall together , see fig.[fig_membranes](c ) .",
    "after that distant observer finds a thermal hydrodynamical explosion as a hologram .",
    "this is the case at mid - rapidity but never in the fragmentation regions .",
    "finally , let me mention a separate direction by kajantie et al @xcite addressing these issues in the 1 + 1 dimensional world .",
    "it is easier to work out math in this case : but shear viscosity is absent in it and bulk viscosity is prohibited by conformity , so it is a cute toy case without dissipation .",

    "<S> = 1    heavy ion experiments continue to surprise us . at this conference sps experiments provided first dilepton flows from na60 , and `` conical flow '' from ceres . star and phenix at rhic showed a lot of new data on jet quenching and jet correlations . </S>",
    "<S> apparent absence of color casimir factors in gluon / quark jets plus `` conical flow '' suggests _ sound radiation _ rather than gluonic one . </S>",
    "<S> heavy quark quenching is another part of this puzzle : and we learned that up to a half of single electrons at the highest @xmath0 came from b quarks , we may soon learn the rate of @xmath1 quenching . with coming lhc and the long - awaited low energy scan at rhic , we will surely have more surprises ahead . </S>",
    "<S> the situation in theory is still profoundly affected by the paradigm shift occurred around 2003 , to the strong - coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> we are still in so - to - say non - equilibrium transition , as huge amount of physics issues required to be learned . </S>",
    "<S> some came from other fields , including physics of _ strongly coupled qed plasmas _ and trapped _ </S>",
    "<S> ultracold gases _ with large scattering length . </S>",
    "<S> _ string theory _ provided a remarkable tool  the ads / cft correspondence  which related heavy ions to the the fascinating physics of strong gravity and _ black holes_. </S>",
    "<S> another important trend is that _ transport properties _ of qgp and _ non - equilibrium dynamics _ came to the forefront : and for those the euclidean approaches ( lattice , instantons ) we used before is much less suited than for thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> all of it made the last 5 years the time of unprecedented challenges . </S>"
