    "most naturally occurring flames are turbulent and unsteady and occur in the presence of significant local stretch .",
    "furthermore , the response of the flame kernel to pressure fluctuations can lead to violent amplification of the heat release , while lean gas mixtures can be difficult to ignite and sustain , with the possible consequence of self - induced oscillations .",
    "the coupling between the flame structure and the unsteady flow field is therefore of fundamental importance both to the theory of flames and to practical combustion systems .    but",
    "direct measurements of the local flame structure and its response to stretch has proved difficult . as a consequence cylindrically and spherically symmetrical flames",
    "have often been studied because these geometries provide simplifications from which information regarding fundamental aspects of flames can still be extracted .    outwardly propagating flames",
    "occur widely such as in automotive engines where fuel / air mixtures are ignited inside a cylinder under high pressure to form a small approximately spherical expanding flame that releases heat to produce useful work , as seen in the images inside an engine captured by @xcite .",
    "expanding flames have been studied more often than implosions as they are easier to produce experimentally ; they have been studied experimentally by  @xcite and numerically by  @xcite and  @xcite .    inwardly propagating flames",
    "are important because they are not subject to strain due to the zero gas velocity ahead of the flame , and stretch is therefore due to the curvature alone and so the effects of curvature can be studied in isolation .",
    "this is important because curvature can have a dominant effect in many combustion phenomena as well as in other powerplant flows , see for example @xcite .",
    "experimentally , implosions are difficult to produce and little data is available ; exceptions though are the experiments of al  @xcite and  @xcite . imploding methane / air flames",
    "have been investigated numerically by  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the last twenty years have seen great progress in the understanding of flame interactions with physical oscillations of different types . quite often models are adopted with approximations in the modeling of the flow and/or the chemistry , e.g. 1-step chemistry , @xcite ; parametric variations in only one physical variable such as the equivalence ratio @xcite , induced pressure fluctuations , @xcite , harmonic velocity fluctuation , @xcite , and flame response to unsteady strain and curvature have also been explored , @xcite .",
    "the impact of pressure fluctuations upon combustor stability have been highlighted in a number of studies e.g.  @xcite , and there is evidence that the intrinsic thermochemical structure may lead to pulsating instabilities , @xcite .",
    "large eddy simulations with a flame surface density model has been used to investigate expanding flames , @xcite .    most of the studies noted above focus on particular effects in isolation , but there is also a need to examine more complex situations where many unsteady processes are occurring at the same time , which is closer to reality .",
    "therefore , in this study we investigate the _ combined _ effect of simultaneous fluctuations in pressure and fuel concentration in unsteady finite thickness flames .",
    "although major advances in computer simulations of combustion systems have been made in recent years , detailed computational studies are still comparatively few , e.g. @xcite . with the need to interrogate complex reacting systems in greater detail ,",
    "it is recognised that a step forward in computational combustion requires the inclusion of more realistic chemistry coupled to the compressible flow , as highlighted in  @xcite .",
    "the need for the inclusion of realistic chemistry is especially important in view of the need to predict emissions of green - house gasses and particulates from industrial devices with a fair degree of accuracy and reliability , as noted by  @xcite .",
    "new challenges are related to the yet unknown behaviour of alternative fuels , such as bio - fuels . although overall green - house gas emissions are low for biomass fuels , these fuels emit higher concentrations of heavy metals and particulates which can be a hazard to industrial devices , such as in automotive engines where the role played by differential diffusion in species and particle transport is of special concern , @xcite .",
    "the recent progress in numerical software and in computer technology now offers the possibility to couple the detailed chemistry to the compressible flow .",
    "large eddy simulations are the methods of choice in large scale numerical simulations in practical applications because they provide an acceptable compromise between grid resolution and the overall size of the system , e.g.  @xcite investigate recirculation and vortex breakdown of swirling flames using les , and luo et al have used les to investigate interactions between a reacting plume and water spray , @xcite , and the aeroacoustics of an unsteady three - dimensional compressible cavity flow , @xcite .    at a more fundamental level , direct numerical simulations using explicit methods have matured in the last fifteen years and are providing useful data , @xcite . although they have had stability problems , significant progress has been made recently in chemical stiffness removal and multi - dimensional scale integration in the studies mentioned above . nevertheless , it is common practice to use reduced chemical schemes in these codes in order to improve stability .",
    "implicit methods have been receiving some attention recently as they are well known to provide stable solvers even for stiff systems although at the cost of large memory requirements .",
    "smooke and co - workers have developed implicit compact scheme solvers for 2d non - reacting flows , @xcite , and for 1d reacting flows with simplified global reaction source term , @xcite .",
    "malik has developed an implicit finite volume method , tardis ( transient advection reaction diffusion implicit simulations ) , @xcite , featuring the coupling of the compressible flow to the comprehensive chemistry and the detailed multicomponent transport properties of the mixture , thus resolving all the convective and chemical length and time scales which is essential for studying stiff and unsteady reacting systems .",
    "tardis thus provides a platform for studying in detail regimes of combustion which were previously difficult to explore due to the limitations of experimental and other numerical methods ; for example , unsteady combustion processes in automobile engines have not been explored numerically or experimentally with full chemistry .",
    "one of the main purposes of this work is to deomstrate the capability of tardis to such complex systems .",
    "an area of special interest in this study is the regime of relatively high karlovich number @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the stretch , the rate of change of an elemental area @xmath11 surrounding a point on the surface of the flame , and @xmath2 is a flame time scale . in this limit",
    ", the convective fluctuations can penetrate inside the internal structure of the flame thus disturbing the flame structure and the system is then essentially unsteady .",
    "little is known of the flame response in this limit and yet its occurrence is widespread because most combustion occurs under turbulent conditions , such as in internal combustion engines , when the smaller convective scales are able to penetrate inside the flame kernel .",
    "many models of turbulent flames often assume that the turbulent flame front consists of a collection of laminar flamelets so that the steady laminar flame structure is assumed to remain undisturbed .",
    "but clearly such an assumption can not remain valid when the convective scales penetrate inside the flame kernel .",
    "the aim of this work is two - fold .",
    "first , we use tardis to study stoichiometric hydrogen / air _ inwardly _ propagating flames ( implosions ) in cylindrical and spherical geometries at mean atmospheric pressure  essentially small fuel pockets being consumed .",
    "we explore the coupling of the thermochemical flame structure to pressure oscillations in the context of inhomogeneous fuel distributions and for different levels of negative stretch ( flow divergence ) , and how this affects properties of the flame such as the flame speed and flame structure .",
    "second , the results will be compared to the results from @xcite who carried out related studies on _ expanding _ hydrogen / air and methane / air flames .",
    "inwardly propagating flames have not been studied as much as expanding flames because they are difficult to produce experimentally .",
    "exceptions though are  @xcite and  @xcite ; baillot et al produced small spherical bubbles of methane - air about 1  mm diameter ( which have high curvature ) .",
    "numerical simulations of imploding flames are also scarce ; @xcite investigated the methane / air system using a simplified 4-step mechanism and a simplified set of balance equations in which the momentum equation was neglected under the assumption that pressure gradients were negligible ; and @xcite has investigated stretched flame velocities in different geometries for different fuels and modes of propagation .    inwardly propagating laminar flames",
    "are not subject to strain due to the zero velocity ahead of the flame .",
    "stretch is therefore due to the curvature alone and so the effects of curvature can be studied in isolation .",
    "a flame front velocity @xmath12 is defined as the physical movement of the flame in space , and is given by the sum of the burning velocity @xmath13 and the gas velocity @xmath14 , @xmath15 . in the case of inwardly propagating flames where @xmath7 ahead of the flame in the fresh gas mixture , we have @xmath16 . in the current study , there is a third component @xmath17 induced by the pressure fluctuations , thus @xmath18 ahead of the flame .",
    "note that the pressure fluctuations exist throughout the domain and therefore @xmath17 can be non - zero anywhere in the domain , even ahead of the flame where the velocity is usually expected to be zero .",
    "the current study features an implicit method , tardis ( see @xcite ) , in which the balance equations of mass , momentum , energy and chemical species , together with the state equation for ideal gas , are solved in an implicit framework on a staggered grid arrangement .",

    "see malik and lindstedt ( 2010 , 2012 )    in order to simulate conditions inside practical devices such as engines , it is desirable to produce unforced pressure fluctuations subject to natural decay due to the action of viscosity , which is typical of conditions after ignition in an engine",
    ". this was achieved by running a pre - calculation consisting of releasing a set of square pressure ramps of large amplitude inside a domain of length @xmath96 ; these pressure ramps then diffuse , convect and reflect back from the ends of the domain until random pressure fluctuations of small amplitude with a range of frequencies are obtained .",
    "when the fluctuations have decayed down to a suitable level ( about @xmath97 of atmospheric pressure ) , the main simulations were started ( @xmath98 ) by introducing the fuel inhomogeneity as a sinusoidal oscillation cycle in the equivalence ratio just ahead of the flame front , @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the length scale of variation and @xmath101 is the initial amplitude .",

    "compete with the flame propagation from the start and partially smoothens out the fuel distribution as the flame moves through the fuel inhomogeneity .",
    "the effect is an approximately sinusoidal but decaying variation in the burning velocity @xmath13 .",
    "second , superimposed on the mean trend are the higher frequency fluctuations in @xmath13 induced by the local flame - pressure interactions .",
    "as in the outwardly propagating hydrogen / air flames in @xcite periodic pressure fluctuations reflecting back from the open boundary and impacting on the reaction layer is evident especially in the spherical flame where the focusing of pressure waves towards the centre is the strongest .",
    "the flame speed @xmath13 does not approach the limits corresponding to the upper and lower bounds of the initial fuel distributions at @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively , indicated by the two horizontal lines in figure  4 .",
    "this is partially due to the smoothening out of inhomogeneities due to action of molecular transport processes ; this is an unsteady system and by the time that the flame arrives at the point where @xmath125 was initially at its peak value of @xmath126 , the local value of @xmath125 is now closer to the mean value of @xmath127 , i.e. @xmath128 .",
    "similar considerations apply to the lower bound where now @xmath129 .",
    "( however , we would expect the upper and lower bounds to be approached if the fuel distribution were stationary which would be possible if the molecular diffusion were very small . )",
    "it is also possible that the flame response to the local rate of heat release is affected by a memory effect which could also prevent the flame speed from attaining to its extreme values .",
    "memory effects are discussed further in section 4.5 .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath1 is the time it takes the flame speed to return to the mean value once disturbed . from figure  4",
    "@xmath1 is the time after which the different @xmath13-curves come to within 5% of the mean value @xmath130 and remain together thereafter .",
    "these times are indicated by the vertical lines in figure 4 .",
    "a non - dimensional relaxation number @xmath3 is defined , @xcite , as @xmath131 which is the ratio of the relaxation time to a flame time scale @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 is a function of stretch , molecular transport processes , the fuel distribution , and possibly also of the pressure fluctuations . in general",
    ", we expect @xmath3 to be a function of many parameters including schmidt number , prandtl number and lewis numbers .",
    "for example for small schmidt numbers , the smoothening of the fuel distribution inhomogeneities due to the stronger molecular diffusion could be more rapid leading to smaller relaxation numbers .    in @xcite",
    "it was noted how effectively positive stretch reduces the relaxation times @xmath1 by about 40% : from @xmath132  ms ( planar ) , to @xmath133  ms ( cylindrical ) ; and @xmath134  ms ( spherical ) .",
    "in contrast , from figure  4 negative curvature reduces @xmath1 by only about 10% from the stretch - free planar flame case : we have @xmath135 in the inwardly propagating cylindrical flame , and @xmath136 in the spherical flame case .",
    "however , the non - dimensional @xmath3 from both the expanding h2/air and expanding ch4/air flames were found to be similar and to follow the same trend : @xmath3 reduces by about 30% going from planar to spherically ch4/air flames and about 40% in the h2/air flames .",

    "the weaker interaction manifests itself here as a smaller reduction in the relaxation number @xmath3 .",
    "the response of the thermochemical flame structure to the unsteady processes is shown in figure  5 where the mole - fraction profiles of selected species against time and radius at 0.1ms intervals are shown from the cylindrical flame ( spherical flames produce qualitatively similar results ) .",
    "figures  6 and 7 show the mole - fraction profiles against the radius of all the species ( except inert nitrogen ) in , respectively , the cylindrical and spherical flames at 0.125ms intervals .",
    "the stable species , such as @xmath55 and @xmath160 , show little response to the oscillations most probably because they are already ` saturated ' at high concentration levels and so small oscillations in the mole - fractions produces little effect .",
    "the observed response of the thermochemical structure in these figures is similar to that found in the positively stretched flames in @xcite .",
    "spectrum _ of chemical species thickness @xmath8 rather than a single global flame thickness @xmath138 seems more appropriate in characterising flame structure .",
    "we may reasonably extend this idea to fluctuations in any physical variable that alters the flame structure , and suggest the existence of an associated spectrum of non - dimensionalised length scales @xmath161 , @xmath162 where @xmath51 is a characteristic length scale of the physical fluctuations .",

    "the mean flame propagation is from right to left ( the centre).,width=566 ]          an issue of practical and theoretical interest is the impact of the physical oscillations on the chemical balance and heat release inside the disturbed flame kernel and the consequent induced time  lag .",
    "figure  8 shows the profiles at 0.1ms intervals , from the cylindrical flame simulations with @xmath122 , of ( a ) the rate of heat release @xmath171 , ( b ) the mole - fractions of h - radical , and ( c ) the mole - fractions of o - radical .",

    "lag between the rate of heat release and the species response was observed in the flames with zero and positive stretch .",
    "a correlated response is more difficult to observe in the flames with negative curvature in figures  8 and 9 because the flames are convected back and forth rapidly smoothen ` flapping '  by the pressure induced velocity fluctuations @xmath172 ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "the general expression for the flame front velocity is @xmath173 where @xmath14 is the gas velocity , and @xmath174 , where the angled brackets represents the ensemble average .",
    "flapping of the flame front by pressure induced fluctuations is always present , but it has rarely been observed because in expanding flames , the most commonly studied case , the gas velocity is much bigger than the fluctuating component , @xmath175 .",
    "but in the current contracting flames where @xmath7 and we have @xmath176 , and the rms @xmath17 is comparable to the burning velocity , @xmath177 , and therefore the flapping of the flame front is much more apparent causing the flame fronts at different times to appear scrambled .    nevertheless , an average trend is observable in figures 8 and 9 , with the @xmath54 and @xmath178 radical concentrations approximately anti - correlated ( most likely due to the main chain branching reaction @xmath179 ) , and the peaks in the respective profiles correlating quite well indicating a short time  lag .",
    "the results from the previous sections have indicated that inwardly propagating flames interact weakly with pressure oscillations , and therefore we can expect that these flames will behave more like planar flames , and therefore the chemical balance inside the flame kernel will remain well correlated to the rate of heat release with short time - lags .",
    "the average trend noted above provides some support for this .",
    "in this study the transient response of premixed negatively stretched hydrogen / air flames at mean atmospheric pressure and at mean stoichiometry , subjected simultaneously to equivalence ratio variations and to naturally decaying pressure fluctuations at frequencies and length scales that can couple to the flame structure has been explored numerically using an implicit method well suited to resolve stiff and unsteady chemically reacting systems .",
    "a comparison with the positively stretched h2/air @xcite and ch4/air flames @xcite was carried out , and a number of important features have emerged .",
    "pressure oscillations in the range @xmath105hz produce steeper spectral broadening which scale close to @xmath180 , as compared to the corresponding positively stretched h2/air flame spectra which scaled close to @xmath181 .",
    "this indicates a weaker flame - pressure response in negatively stretched flames , although the spectral broadening occurs across a wider range of frequencies ; in the case of imploding spherical flames the range of excited frequencies extends to very high frequencies .",
    "it is interesting that the expanding ch4/air flames also produced spectra close to @xmath180 .    the non - dimensional relaxation number @xmath3 is defined as the ratio of the relaxation time to a flame time scale @xmath182 ; it is a function of stretch , molecular transport processes , fuel distribution , and the frequency and amplitude of the fluctuations .",
    "@xmath3 contains information about the competing processes of flame propagation and molecular transport : if molecular diffusion is dominant then we would expect @xmath3 to be small .",
    "@xmath3 may also be indicative of flame stability to external disturbance in the sense that a smaller values of @xmath3 means that the reactive - diffusive system returns to mean conditions quickly indicating greater flame stability .",
    "the relaxation number @xmath3 was found to decrease by only 10% with increasing negative stretch ( flow divergence ) in h2/air flames compared to the zero stretch planar flame case ; but @xmath3 was found to decrease by about 40% with increasing positive stretch in h2/air flames in @xcite .",
    "negative stretch thus appears to couple less strongly with dynamic processes such as pressure fluctuations and transport processes than does positive stretch , because it reduces the relaxation number to a lesser extent than the latter .",
    "this picture is consistent with the spectral analysis mentioned above .",
    "this point is further strengthened by the fact that the trends in @xmath3 in both the h2/air and ch4/air _ expanding _ flames is similar , see table  2 , even though h2/air and ch4/air are at opposite ends of the reactivity scale , h2/air being a very reactive mixture .",
    "@xmath3 thus appears to more strongly correlated with the sign of the curvature than with the thermo - chemistry of different flame types .",
    "this may in part be due to the fact that both curvature and strain contribute to positive stretch in expanding flames , but curvature alone contributes to negative stretch in imploding flames because of the absence of strain ( gas velocity ) ahead of the flame , @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath3 is potentially important as a non - dimensional time for an inhomogeneous system to return to the mean conditions when subjected to external perturbations .",
    "it may have significance for automotive engines where such conditions are prevalent ; if a system has a short relaxation time then it attains to mean conditions rapidly and therefore mean field modeling strategies could be effective .    for moderate levels of inhomogeneity @xmath183 , and",
    "short length scales @xmath184 and pressure fluctuations in the frequency range @xmath185 , the molecular transport processes are competitive with flame propagation and partially reduce the fuel inhomogeneities during the time that the flame moves through the fuel oscillation cycle , such that the upper and lower limits of the flame speed @xmath13 are not attained .",
    "negative curvature appears not to alter this process significantly under the conditions of the simulation , which again is consistent with the spectral and the relaxation number analysis , which both indicate reduced strengths of flame - pressure coupling with negative curvature .",
    "flapping of the flame induced by the pressure fluctuations is much more prominent in inwardly propagating flames due to the zero gas velocity ahead of the flame @xmath7 .",
    "this is seen in the scrambling of the flame fronts in successive short time frames seen in figures  8 and 9 .",
    "flapping has rarely been observed before because the large gas velocity in expanding flames , the most commonly observed case , overwhelms the flapping since @xmath175 .",
    "flapping may have consequences for other effects such as spectra , relaxation numbers and time - lag through non - linear coupling of the flame - front with the chemical kinetics and molecular transport processes .",
    "but in view of the weaker flame - pressure coupling observed in negatively stretched flames it is reasonable to assume that the effect on time - lag will also be weaker so that the chemical balance in the flame kernel will remain close to the zero stretch ( planar flame ) case . the flame structure",
    "will then be well correlated with the rate of heat release and this will lead to a short time - lag as the flame attempts to adjust to the unsteady local conditions .",
    "such a trend in the mean is observed over short times in figures  8 and 9 .",
    "however , it is possible that different conditions  such as stronger pressure fluctuations , stronger inhomogeneity , stronger stretch , different fuels , and lean / rich conditions  could produce stronger or weaker disruption to the chemical balance through coupling with non - linear transport processes and pressure fluctuations .",
    "to some extent this has already been observed in outwardly propagating mode in @xcite where the impact of positive stretch was stronger . @xcite",
    "have looked at turbulent premixed hydrogen flames and observed dominant kinetics or dominant pressure effects , depending upon fuel - lean and fuel - rich conditions .",
    "however , it is not yet known whether this is specific to hydrogen flames .",
    "the response of the thermochemical structure to pressure and fuel distribution fluctuations is similar to that observed in the expanding flames in @xcite .",
    "the evidence suggests that we can characterise flame response by a spectrum of non - dimensional length scales @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the lengths scale of the @xmath188 species , and @xmath51 is the scale of the physical oscillations ( pressure oscillations in the current study ) .",
    "we find that all species oscillate in their peak concentrations in response to the local pressure and fuel distribution ; but thick unstable species with @xmath189 are also disturbed across their entire length .",
    "the major stable species concentrations are ` saturated ' at high levels and the induced fluctuations are too small to be observable in their profiles .",
    "the study reported here is of importance to combustion processes at a fundamental level as well as to practical devices such as automotive engines and gas turbines .",
    "engines for example increasingly use lean fuel mixtures and there is also a trend towards the use of alternative fuels , such as biofuels .",
    "this requires the study of lean combustion processes for the prediction of emissions levels , which in turn requires the inclusion of realistic chemistry coupled to the compressible flow .",
    "the method used here demonstrates that detailed numerical studies of such complexity is now possible .",
    "the implicit method tardis , @xcite , has provided a platform to explore finite thickness premixed flames in great detail because of its capability of coupling the fully compressible flow to the comprehensive ( realistic ) chemistry and detailed transport properties .",
    "the implicit nature of the solver gives it stability , and it resolves all the temporal and spatial scales in the systems examined here .",
    "this feature allows very complex systems in unsteady contexts to be explored , and as such is a step towards more realistic combustion simulations .",
    "we have explored negatively stretched hydrogen / air flames subjected to fluctuations in pressure and fuel distributions .",
    "the impact of increasing negative stretch was investigated through the use of planar , cylindrical and spherical geometries , and a comparison with the results from expanding hydrogen / air flames in @xcite was made .",
    "imploding flames are of interest because they have rarely been studied and also because only negative curvature contributes to the stretch so that the effects of curvature can be studied in isolation .",
    "overall , we have found that the results from axi - symmetric ( cylindrical ) flames are qualitaively similar to those from the corresponding spherical flames .",
    "this is consistent with the previous studies for expanding h2/air flames , @xcite , and expanding methane / air flames , @xcite .",
    "this suggests that it is the fuel type and the flame propagation mode that are the dominant features in the these systems .",
    "the flame relaxation number @xmath0 , ( where @xmath1 is the time that the flame speed @xmath13 takes to return to the mean equilibrium conditions after initial disturbance ; @xmath2 is a flame time scale ) contains information about competing processes of flame propagation and molecular transport .",
    "@xmath3 decreases by only 10% with increasing _ negative _ stretch , and by about 40% in expanding flames with _ positive _ stretch in  @xcite , see table  2 .",
    "furthermore , the fluctuating pressure spectra @xmath4 scale close to @xmath5 , which is steeper than in the expanding h2/air flames which scales like @xmath190 , but is close to the spectra observed in the expanding ch4/air flames .",
    "the flame relaxation number @xmath3 appears to be far more sensitive to variations in positive and negative curvature than it is to the different thermo - chemistry in different flame types .",
    "the decrease in @xmath3 is much less with negative curvature than with positive curvature .",
    "@xmath3 may therefore be an indicator of flame - curvature coupling , and the results here may indicate that negative curvature couples less strongly to the flame thermo - chemistry than in positive curvature flames , which is consistent with the spectral analysis mentioned above .",
    "however this needs more investigation and is the subject of current ongoing work .",
    "rapid flapping of the flame front by the random velocity fluctuations induced by the pressure fluctuation is prominent again due to the lack of gas velocity ahead of the flame .",
    "` memory effects ' between fuel consumption and the rate of heat release is obscured by the flapping , although on theoretical grounds we expect inwardly propagating flames to have shorter time - lags than in positively stretched flames .",
    "a spectrum of species thickness @xmath191 exists such that species formed in thin reaction layers are generally not disturbed except in their peak concentrations .",
    "stable species profiles are unaffected by small levels of oscillations .",
    "thus , it may be more useful to characterise the internal structure of flames in terms of a spectrum of length scales rather than in terms of a single flame thickness .",
