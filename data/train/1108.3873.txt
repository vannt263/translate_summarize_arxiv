    "wireless relaying technology has been recently proposed as a method that promises significant performance improvement in wireless communications without any power increase @xcite . among the most common relaying techniques",
    "is so - called relay selection which has been extensively analyzed in the literature @xcite . in relay selection ,",
    "the system is able to select a single relay out of the set of available relays , in order to take advantage of the multiple paths available and thus achieve spatial diversity .",
    "it has been shown that activating only the relay with the strongest instantaneous end - to - end channel represents a bandwidth - efficient alternative to all - participate relaying , since , on the one hand , the same diversity order is achieved , yet on the other hand , the excessive bandwidth usage that the activation of multiple relays entails is avoided @xcite .",
    "most of the literature dealing with relay selection in fading channels has assumed that perfect channel state information ( csi ) is available at the terminal where the decision on which relay to activate is made .",
    "this assumption , however , may not be true in practical scenarios where the channel changes rapidly enough , so that the csi available at the selecting terminal is outdated . in addition , if the power allocated to the pilot symbols is not sufficiently high , the noisy channel estimates may lead to suboptimal relay selection .",
    "the above two cases reveal the vulnerability of relay selection to imperfect channel estimation , and constitute the main rationale for conducting a thorough outage and diversity analysis of relay selection in scenarios with imperfect csi in this work .",
    "in fact , the case of relay selection under outdated csi and rayleigh fading has been recently studied in @xcite , where interesting results on the outage probability and diversity order were derived .",
    "nonetheless , these works consider only a special case , since they assume that the csi imperfection stems only from delayed feedback",
    ". this may not always be the case in practice , since channel estimates may also be impaired by time - varying fading and channel noise . in the very recent works @xcite , the effect of noisy channel estimates",
    "is also included in the performance analysis .",
    "however , these works are based on the assumption that the same estimates are used for both relay selection and detection , leading to zero diversity order",
    ". such assumption may not always be true in practical scenarios where the number of pilots used for relay selection and that used for symbol detection may not be equal to each other .    in light of the above ,",
    "the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows .",
    "* we conduct an outage analysis of relay selection with imperfect csi , which is general enough so as to account for both the effects of noisy and outdated channel estimates , integrated into a unified model .",
    "in particular , a closed - form expression for the outage probability is derived , which incorporates all effects that can cause imperfect channel estimates in practical applications .",
    "the considered channel estimation techniques include the cases of estimation in noisy static channels ; estimation in noiseless time - varying channels , and estimation in noisy time - varying channel with the aid of finite impulse response ( fir ) and infinite impulse response ( iir ) channel prediction . * the amount of csi imperfection is reflected by the correlation coefficient between the actual and the estimated channel values , @xmath1 , which is modeled as a non - decreasing function of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) . as a result ,",
    "the asymptotic outage behavior of relay selection is determined by the speed of convergence of the correlation coefficient to unity , as the snr approaches infinity .",
    "the diversity order of relay selection with imperfect csi is thereby derived , shedding light onto the diversity loss caused by imperfect csi , with implications for the design of channel estimation techniques .",
    "* in contrast to other relevant works in the literature , where rayleigh fading channels were assumed , the versatile scenario of nakagami-@xmath0 fading is studied .",
    "it is shown that the resulting diversity order is directly proportional to the fading shape parameter , @xmath0 .",
    "overall , the general conclusion of this paper is that the level of csi imperfection plays an important role in the overall performance of relay selection , considerably affecting its diversity potential .",
    "a detailed discussion on the diversity order of relay selection for several practical channel estimation techniques is presented in section [ divpot ] , and corresponding numerical examples are given in section [ nr ] .",
    "these results are based on the exact outage analysis conducted in section [ pa ] for rayleigh fading and certain channel estimation techniques , and extended to nakagami-@xmath0 fading in section [ pa2 ] .",
    "prior to the outage analysis , the unified model that incorporates the effects of noisy and outdated channel estimates is presented in section [ imprf ] .",
    "the system model of decode - and - forward ( df ) relay selection with imperfect csi is given next , in section [ sm ] .",
    "let us consider a cooperative relaying system which consists of a single source terminal , @xmath2 , @xmath3 df relays which are denoted by @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and operate in the half - duplex mode @xcite , and a single destination terminal , @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the complex channel between nodes @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , rayleigh distributed fading in each of the participating links is assumed , implying that @xmath7 is complex gaussian random variable ( rv ) .",
    "the versatile scenario of nakagami-@xmath0 distribution of fading is considered in section [ pa2 ] .",
    "in addition , since in this work we focus our attention on the asymptotic properties of relay selection under imperfect csi , we assume independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "fading in each of the links involved .",
    "moreover , the fading is considered slow enough such that @xmath7 remains constant during the transmission of one frame .",
    "let @xmath12 represent the instantaneous snr of the link between terminals @xmath8 and @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) power .",
    "due to the i.i.d .",
    "fading assumption , the average snr in each of the links involved is identical , and denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , we use the notation @xmath16 and @xmath17 to refer to the probability density function ( pdf ) and the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of rv @xmath18 , respectively .      among the available relays ,",
    "only a single relay is activated in each transmission session , based on the selection cooperation protocol beres . in particular , the relay selection procedure is completed in two phases , as follows . in the first phase , the relays that can successfully decode the message form the so - called decoding set , denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "mathematically speaking , the decoding set @xmath19 is defined as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the outage threshold snr , defined as the maximum snr value that allows decoding ; @xmath21 is related to the target data rate , @xmath22 , through @xmath23 .",
    "in the second phase , the destination collects the estimated csi of the @xmath4-@xmath24 links with @xmath25 , and activates the relay with the strongest @xmath4-@xmath6 channel .",
    "a fundamental principle throughout this paper is the fact that the relay selection is based not on the actual channel values but on their estimates , which are generally not equal to each other . in this respect ,",
    "let @xmath26 denote the estimate of channel @xmath7 , so that @xmath27 represents the estimated value of @xmath12 , as seen by the destination .",
    "hence , denoting the selected relay by @xmath28 , we have @xmath29the csi imperfection is assumed to affect the relay selection process , but not the symbol detection at the destination .",
    "this is because the number of pilot symbols used for detection is typically higher than that used for relay selection , and the channel estimates for detection can be updated more frequently . a detailed description of the considered imperfect csi model follows .",
    "the physical causes of the considered csi degradation are the time - varying nature of fading channels , as well as finite pilot symbol power . in this work ,",
    "both of these causes of imperfect csi are integrated into a unified model , as shown below .",
    "the level of csi imperfection is quantified by the correlation coefficient between the actual squared channel envelope value , @xmath30 , and its corresponding estimate , @xmath31 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be any terminals of the set @xmath32 .",
    "this coefficient is defined as ( in the sequel , all channel indices are dropped due to the i.i.d . fading assumption)@xmath33where @xmath34 , @xmath35 with @xmath36 denoting expectation , and @xmath37 denotes the standard deviation of rv @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath38 reflects the effect of imperfect csi on the snr of the selected relay and hence on the overall performance of relay selection with imperfect csi .",
    "for this reason , the subsequent analysis focuses on expressing the performance degradation as a function of @xmath38 , so that all physical phenomena that cause csi degradation are , in fact , incorporated into @xmath38 .      in accordance with the intuition that channel estimation is performed in noisy environments ,",
    "let us consider the versatile scenario where @xmath38 is a function of the snr . that is,@xmath39where @xmath40 is generally a non - increasing function of its argument , with @xmath41 . in order to obtain insight into the asymptotic dependence of the csi error on the snr",
    ", we expand @xmath42 into a puiseux series @xcite , so that for high snr we have@xmath43where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are positive constants with @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is defined such that @xmath48 .    it is emphasized that the versatile imperfect csi model considered in ( g1 ) and ( [ grd ] ) is general enough to accommodate the cases of imperfect csi due to noise impairment and the time - varying nature of the underlying channels .",
    "next , we study the scenarios of csi imperfection in static and time - varying rayleigh fading channels , separately .",
    "let us assume the case of static channels , where channel estimation is implemented via averaging over @xmath49 noisy pilot symbols",
    ". as a result , @xmath50 in ( [ g1 ] ) is a decreasing function of @xmath51 , for which @xmath52 holds .",
    "moreover , let us consider the scenario where the power allocated to pilot symbols , @xmath53 , is not necessarily equal to the power allocated to data transmission , @xmath54 .",
    "we allow the ratio of @xmath53 over @xmath54 to be snr - dependent , so that@xmath55where @xmath56 is a positive constant and @xmath57 is a constant , the sign of which determines whether @xmath53 increases or decreases with snr .",
    "the estimated channel values are expressed as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the true channel component and the remaining noise component , respectively .",
    "given that the channel estimates are derived by averaging over @xmath49 pilot symbols , the noise variance of the estimation process equals @xmath61    [ rhot]the correlation coefficient , @xmath38 , between @xmath62 and @xmath63 , is given by@xmath64    since @xmath65 equals a linear combination of complex gaussian rvs , @xmath66 is exponentially distributed .",
    "hence , it follows from the theory of the moments of exponential rvs that @xmath67 ; @xmath68 ) after algebraic manipulations , in conjunction with ( [ ep ] ) and the fact that @xmath69 .",
    "expanding ( [ theo ] ) in a taylor series for @xmath70 and using ( [ g1 ] ) , we obtain for @xmath71 yields @xmath72 for @xmath70 , and is out of the scope of this paper.]@xmath73therefore , using ( [ grd ] ) , from ( [ rhoa2 ] ) we have @xmath74 ; @xmath75 .      next , the case of time - varying rayleigh fading is studied , where the maximum doppler frequency on each of the participating links is assumed identical , and denoted by @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , the autocorrelation function of the complex channel @xmath59 is denoted by @xmath77 ; based on the jakes model @xcite , @xmath77 is given as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 denotes the zeroth order bessel function of the first kind ( * ? ? ?",

    "in time - varying environments , the channel estimation can be improved by utilizing the csi available from previous time instances , so that the channel estimates are derived through a _ channel prediction _",

    "let us consider an fir channel prediction filter of length @xmath80 , and denote the time interval between consecutive csi acquisitions by @xmath81 .",
