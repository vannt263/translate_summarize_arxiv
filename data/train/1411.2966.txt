    "the casimir force@xcite acts between closely spaced material bodies .",
    "it is caused by the zero - point and thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the casimir force is of the same physical nature as the van der waals force , but it acts at larger separation distances ( typically starting from a few nanometers to a few micrometers ) , where the effects of relativistic retardation become essential .",
    "the casimir effect finds numerous and diverse applications ranging from condensed matter physics and nanotechnology to quantum field theory , gravitation and cosmology@xcite .",
    "specifically , in nanotechnology the casimir force can lead to a stiction and a loss of functionality in microdevices@xcite , on the one hand , and plays a useful role by actuating microdevices@xcite , on the other hand .",
    "advances in microfabrication techniques allowed to perform precise measurements of the casimir force and its gradient at separations up to a few hundred nanometers at room and lower temperature ( see reviews@xcite and some of later experiments@xcite ) .",
    "the measurement results have been compared with theoretical predictions of the lifshitz theory@xcite of the van der waals and casimir forces .",
    "this comparison resulted in a big surprise .",
    "the lifshitz theory uses the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity @xmath0 of interacting bodies as an input data for calculation .",
    "it turned out that if the low - frequency behavior of @xmath0 is described by the most precise drude model , taking into account the relaxation properties of conduction electrons in metals , the theoretical results are excluded by the data at a high confidence level@xcite . if , alternatively , the low - frequency behavior of @xmath0 is described by the nondissipative plasma model , the theoretical results are consistent with the measurement data .",
    "( there is only one experiment@xcite , which is claimed to be in agreement with the drude model ; it measures , however , not the casimir force , but up to an order of magnitude larger force of unclear origin and subtracts the major part of it by means of a fitting procedure which was critically discussed in the literature@xcite . )    in parallel with the experimental progress , the analytic behavior of the casimir free energy and entropy at low temperature has been found in the framework of the lifshitz theory for the case of two metallic test bodies@xcite . here also a big surprise has been found supposedly connected with the above puzzle in theory - experiment comparison . on the one hand , for metal plates with perfect crystal lattices , the casimir entropy calculated by using the lifshitz theory combined with the drude model was shown to go to a nonzero negative limit depending on the parameters of the system when the temperature vanishes@xcite .",
    "this means the violation of the third law of thermodynamics ( the nernst heat theorem ) .",
    "if the dielectric permittivity of the plasma model is used , the casimir entropy was shown to go to the zero limit when temperature goes to zero , i.e. , the nernst heat theorem is satisfied . on the other hand , at large separations ,",
    "where the casimir force is classical , the plasma model was shown @xcite to violate the bohr - van leeuwen theorem , whereas the drude model is consistent with it .",
    "later on , the thermodynamic inconsistency was also revealed for dielectric plates with taken into account conductivity at a constant current ( the dc conductivity ) .",
    "it was shown@xcite that in this case the casimir entropy goes to a nonzero positive limit depending on the parameters of a system when the temperature vanishes .",
    "the experimental data of several experiments using dielectric materials were found in agreement with theoretical predictions of the lifshitz theory only if the contribution of free charge carriers into the dielectric permittivity is omitted@xcite .",
    "many attempts were undertaken in order to solve the problem of thermodynamic inconsistency of the lifshitz theory .",
    "specifically , it was argued@xcite that for metallic crystal lattices with some concentration of impurities there is some small but nonzero residual relaxation at zero temperature . as a result ,",
    "at very low temperature the casimir entropy undergoes an abrupt increase to zero and the nernst heat theorem is formally satisfied .",
    "the problem remains , however , unsolved for metals with perfect crystal lattices because the perfect lattice is a truly equilibrium system with the nondegenerate dynamical state of lowest energy .",
    "thus , the nernst heat theorem should be satisfied in this case .",
    "another attempt to avoid thermodynamic inconsistency for dielectrics@xcite and metals@xcite goes beyond the lifshits theory and modifies it by taking into account screening effects and diffusion currents of free charge carriers .",
    "it was shown , however , that for metals with perfect crystal lattices , as well as for those dielectrics whose concentration of free charge carriers does not go to zero with vanishing temperature ( for such dielectric materials conductivity goes to zero due to vanishing mobility ) , the nernst heat theory remains to be violated in the modified theory@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the modified theory turned out to be excluded by the measurement data of experiments with metallic test bodies at the same high level of confidence as the standard drude model@xcite . for dielectric test bodies",
    "the modified theory was found to be consistent with the data of experiment@xcite , but still excluded by the experiment@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the low - temperature behavior of the casimir free energy , entropy and pressure for two parallel plates made of a magnetodielectric material .",
    "the lifshitz theory was generalized for the case of magnetic materials long ago@xcite , and this subject recently received considerable attention in the literature@xcite .",
    "it became especially topical after successful measurements of the gradient of the casimir force between magnetic materials@xcite , which again excluded the drude model and turned out to be consistent with the plasma model .",
    "here , we show that for magnetodielectric plates the low - temperature behavior of all physical quantities is typically the same as for dielectric ones , and only the respective coefficients are generalized due to the presence of an additional parameter  the magnetic permeability @xmath1 . as a result",
    ", we have proven that for magnetodielectric plates with omitted dc conductivity the nernst heat theorem is satisfied and , if the dc conductivity is included , the nernst theorem is violated .",
    "this result is obtained for both constant and frequency - dependent magnetic permeability .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : formalism ] contains brief presentation of the formalism adapted for use in perturbation expansions . in section  [ sec : const ] we derive the asymptotic expressions for the casimir free energy , entropy and pressure at low temperature for magnetodielectrics with constant dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability .",
    "section  [ sec : freq ] is devoted to the account of frequency dependence . in section  [ sec : concl ] we formulate our conclusions .",
    "we consider two parallel thick magnetodielectric plates ( semispaces ) characterized by the frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity @xmath2 and magnetic permeability @xmath3 at temperature @xmath4 in thermal equilibrium with an environment . in terms of dimensionless variables ,",
    "the lifshitz formula for the free energy of the casimir interaction per unit area of the plates is given by@xcite @xmath5.\\ ] ] here , @xmath6 is the separation distance between the plates and the dimensionless quantity @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the boltzmann constant .",

    "one can rearrange   to the for form@xcite @xmath19 where the first term on the right - hand side is the casimir energy per unit area at zero temperature @xmath20 + \\ln \\left [ 1- r^2_{\\mathrm{te } } ( \\rmi \\zeta , y ) \\rme^{-y } \\right ] \\right\\}.      } \\ ] ] the second term on the right - hand side of   has the meaning of the thermal correction @xmath21    in a similar way , the casimir pressure can be represented in the form @xmath22 where the casimir pressure at @xmath23 is @xcite @xmath24 ,      } \\ ] ] and the thermal correction to it is given by@xcite @xmath25",
    "in this section we describe the magnetodielectric plates by their static dielectric permittivity @xmath26 and magnetic permeability @xmath27 .",
    "in fact at sufficiently low @xmath4 the matsubara frequencies , giving the leading contribution to the thermal corrections   and   for insulating material with no free charge carriers , belong to the region where @xmath2 is almost constant and equal to @xmath28 . because of this , the qualitative behavior of the casimir free energy at low temperature for dielectric materials described by constant and frequency - dependent @xmath2 is similar ( only a power in the power - type law can be different@xcite ) .",
    "the account of dc conductivity in the dielectric permittivity and frequency - dependence of the magnetic permeability are discussed in section  [ sec : freq ] .",

    "is straightforward to get the analytic behavior of the casimir entropy per unit area at low temperature @xmath44 here , we returned to the dimensional temperature @xmath4 .",
    "as can be seen from this expression , the casimir entropy goes to zero when the temperature vanishes , i.e. , the nernst heat theorem is satisfied for the magnetodielectric plates .",
    "note that the right - hand side of   does not depend on @xmath6 because @xmath45 .",

    "the perturbation asymptotic expansion for the casimir pressure is obtained in a direct way starting from equation  .",
    "this makes possible to find the next terms in the asymptotic expressions   and   for the thermal correction to the casimir energy and for the casimir entropy , respectively .",

    "as was mentioned in the beginning of section  [ sec : const ] , the frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity of dielectric materials plays only a minor role in the behavior of the casimir free energy and entropy at low temperature@xcite . in this section",
    "we investigate the impact of the frequency dependence of the magnetic permeability .",
    "then we consider what happens when the magnetodielectric material contains some small fraction of free charge carriers which is the case for any real dielectric at nonzero temperature .",
    "the dependence of the magnetic permeability on the frequency along the imaginary frequency axis is described by the debye formula@xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is some characteristic frequency which is different for different magnetic materials . using the dimensionless variables introduced in section  [ sec : formalism ]",
    ", one has @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",

    "we substitute the sum @xmath66 to the definition of the function @xmath67 in   in place of @xmath30 and in the first perturbation order arrive at @xmath68    note that the term of the order of @xmath69 in   does not contribute to the difference @xmath70 .",

    "if to compare with  , it is seen that now the leading order in @xmath4 is the first instead of the second .",
    "the reason is the account of the frequency dependence of the magnetic permeability .",
    "thus , an account of the frequency dependence of @xmath3 results in the change of power in the power - type law like this holds for @xmath2@xcite .",
    "it is common knowledge that all dielectric materials at any nonzero temperature contain some small concentration of free charge carriers . as a result",
    ", the dielectric permittivity @xmath76 calculated at the imaginary matsubara frequencies should be replaced with @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the static ( dc ) conductivity of the dielectric and @xmath79 . in previous sections",

    "thus , if the dc conductivity of magnetodielectric materials is taken into consideration , the lifshitz theory violates the third law of thermodynamics in the same way as for ordinary dielectrics which do not possess magnetic properties@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the low - temperature behavior of the casimir entropy for two parallel plates made of magnetodielectric materials . for this purpose ,",
    "the casimir free energy at low temperature was found analytically for both constant and frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability in the form of perturbation expansions .",
    "the effect of dc conductivity was also taken into account .",
    "it was shown that for magnetodielectric materials characterized by the finite static dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability the casimir entropy goes to zero when the temperature vanishes , i.e. , the third law of thermodynamics ( the nernst heat theorem ) is satisfied . by contrast",
    ", if the dc conductivity is taken into account , in the limiting case of zero temperature the casimir entropy goes to the positive constant depending on the parameters of a system , i.e. , the nernst heat theorem is violated .",
    "this is the same effect , as was discovered previously for dielectrics which do not possess magnetic properties@xcite . in so doing",
    ", the value of the entropy at zero temperature does not depend on the magnetic permeability of the plates .",
    "as is mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , the measurement data of several experiments using dielectric plates are consistent with theoretical predictions of the lifshitz theory only if the contribution of dc conductivity is omitted in computations .",
    "this means that experimentally consistent is the theoretical approach , which is also in agreement with thermodynamics .",
    "this would be not surprising if the dc conductivity of dielectrics at room temperature were not an observable physical effect contributing in many experiments with an exception of the casimir effect . to conclude",
    "we can say that the violation of the nernst heat theorem for magnetodielectric materials in the lifshitz theory is a challenging problem which awaits for its resolution .",
