    "@xcite because of the pauli exclusion principle , these fermionic atoms can display a variety of interesting phenomena and phases that do not have an analog in bosonic systems.@xcite in the remainder of the paper we shall focus on fermionic systems of three internal degrees of freedom and show how a quantum phase transition appears in this system , which is a simplified version of the color superconductor - baryon phase transition in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "typical hyperfine couplings are larger than the standard experimental temperatures used to study ultracold gases . in the absence of an external magnetic field , the hyperfine coupling aligns nuclear ( @xmath1 ) and electronic ( @xmath2 ) spin antiparallel to each other , and the hyperfine spin @xmath3 is conserved . in finite magnetic fields , only the hyperfine spin @xmath4 along the external field is a good quantum number .",
    "the hyperfine spin @xmath4 thus provides an internal quantum number that we shall refer to as `` color '' henceforth .",
    "systems with three internal quantum numbers are of special interest , since they are rarely observed in solid state physics .",
    "such a three - component fermionic system may be created , e.g. , by trapping the lowest three hyperfine levels of @xmath5li atoms in all - optical setups in large magnetic fields ( see fig .  [",

    ", width=151 ]    the trapped atoms , however , also interact with each other .",
    "the dominant interactions between alkali atoms are short - ranged electrostatic van der waals forces , which can be well approximated by @xmath8 potentials at low energy scales .",
    "if the scattering length of the interacting atoms is smaller than the lattice constant of the optical lattice , then these interactions are restricted to a given lattice site .",
    "correspondingly , the interacting system of atoms in an optical lattice can be accurately described by the following hamiltonian :    @xmath9    with @xmath10 the creation operator of a fermionic atom of color @xmath11 at site @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . in the tunneling term , @xmath14 implies restriction to nearest neighbor sites , and the tunneling matrix element is approximately given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the recoil energy , @xmath17 is the wavevector of the lasers , @xmath18 is the mass of the atoms , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the depth of the periodic potential.@xcite we neglect the effects of the confining potential in eq .  ( [ eq : h ] ) , which would correspond to a site - dependent potential term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the interaction strength @xmath21 between colors @xmath22 and @xmath23 is related to the corresponding @xmath24-wave scattering length , @xmath25 , as @xmath26.@xcite note that fermions with identical colors do not interact with each other .    for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we shall first consider the attractive case with @xmath27 .",
    "this case could be realized by loading the @xmath5li atoms into an optical trap in a large magnetic field , where the scattering lengths become large and negative @xmath28 , for all three scattering channels , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31.@xcite introducing the usual gell - mann matrices , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , it is easy to see that global su(3 ) transformations @xmath34 commute with the hamiltonian , which thus also conserves the total number of fermions for each color , @xmath35 .",
    "this conservation of particles is only approximate because in reality the number of the atoms in the trap continuously decreases due to different scattering processes . here",

    "however , as we discussed in ref .  , for large attractive interactions",
    ", this superfluid state becomes unstable , and instead of cooper pairs , it is more likely to form three - atom bound states , the so - called  trions \" .",
    "these trions are color singlet fermions , and for large @xmath42 they have a hopping amplitude , @xmath43 furthermore , one can easily see that if two trions sit on neighboring lattice sites , then they increase the energy of each other by an amount @xmath44 .",
    "this is because the energy of an individual trion is decreased by quantum fluctuations where one of the atoms virtually hops to one of the neighboring sites .",
    "these quantum fluctuations are reduced if the two trions sit next to each other .",
    "therefore , trions will tend to form a fermi - liquid in any finite dimensions .",
    "this fermi liquid state may be further decorated by charge density wave order at large values of @xmath42 .",
    "also , the fermi liquid scale @xmath45 of the trionic fermi liquid should depend on the value of @xmath46 , and at the transition point , @xmath47 , we expect it to go zero ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : pert ] and [ fig : sketch ] ) .    in order to get analytic expressions",
    ", we shall study the ground state in @xmath48 dimensions .",
    "then , to reach a meaningful limit and to get finite kinetic energy , one has to scale the hopping as @xmath49 , with @xmath50 fixed . in this limit , however , trions become immobile . therefore the @xmath51 trionic states are well approximated as @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes a subset of sites where trions sit .",
    "we can calculate the energy of this state in infinite dimensions : a single trion has an energy @xmath54 , thus the energy of such a state per lattice site is given by @xmath55 , with @xmath56 the total energy of the system and @xmath57 the number of lattice sites .",

    "the color superfluid phase is stable below a critical temperature @xmath58 , where the appearance of superfluid domains is expected . at large interaction strengths @xmath59",
    ", color singlet trions emerge instead of the cooper pairs and form a fermi liquid at low temperatures @xmath60 .",
    ", width=226 ]    clearly , the two ground states obtained by the perturbative expansions have different symmetries : the superfluid state breaks su(3 ) invariance , while the trionic state does not . therefore , there must be a phase transition between them .",
    "note that , relying on symmetries only , this argument is very robust and carries over to _ any _ dimensions . in infinite dimensions",
    ", we find that trions are immobile .",
    "however , this is only an artifact of infinite dimensions and in finite dimensions , a superfluid - fermi liquid phase transition should occur .",
    "one could envision that some other order parameter also emerges and masks the phase transition discussed here .",
    "preliminary results ( not discussed here ) suggest that indeed a charge density state forms at large values of @xmath42 , but except for half filling , which is a special case not discussed here , we do not see any other relevant order parameter that could intrude as a new phase .",
    "one could , in principle , also imagine a phase with simultaneous trionic and fermionic fermi surfaces , similar to the one of ref .",
    "however , in contrast to the calculations of ref .",
    "( which do not take the local constraints on the lattice into account ) , in our scenario , there is no fermi surface at the quantum critical point .    from the above argument",
    ", it is unclear whether the phase transition is of first or of second order . to address this question in infinite dimensions and give some more quantitative estimates for the relevant condensation energies and the critical value of @xmath61",
    ", we need an approach that is able to describe the superfluid state and , at the same time , also accounts for three - body correlations . in the present paper ,",
    "we construct a variational gutzwiller wave function that is able to capture both correlations simultaneously .",
    "we then show how averages can be evaluated by constructing an effective action that contains three - body correlations and how calculations can be analytically done in infinite dimensions by using the methodology of dynamical mean field theory.@xcite our method , which uses a single suitably chosen gutzwiller correlator and exploits the cavity method of dynamical mean field theory , is in its present form less flexible than the multiband method reviewed by bnemann _ _ et . al.,__@xcite but it incorporates three - body correlations in a very transparent way .",
    "our analysis shows that , within the gutzwiller approach , the phase transition is of _ second order _ in infinite dimensions .",
    "we therefore expect it to remain of second order in any finite dimension above the lower critical dimension .",
    "nevertheless , as we discuss later , the quantum phase transition may become of slightly first order due to a not perfectly su(3)-symmetrical interaction .",
    "interestingly , our results also suggest that there is a tendency to create an imbalance of the densities @xmath36 in the superfluid phase .",
    "the physical reason is simple : one can gain condensation energy by transferring atoms from the unpaired channel to the paired ones and thereby create _",
    "ferromagnetic order _ as a secondary order parameter . for equal densities",
    "@xmath62 and color conservation , his can only happen if the atoms are segregated and domains are formed , as shown in fig .",

    "so far , we discussed the fully su(3 ) symmetrical case . as we also demonstrate later , the phase transition discussed above is not sensitive to having perfect su(3 ) symmetry . on the other hand , to form the superfluid phase , it is important to have approximately the same fermi momenta for at least two colors .",

    "another important difference is the order of the phase transition : in our case , the two phases are separated by a quantum critical point , while in qcd , the transition is of first order , due to the long - ranged interactions .",

    "in this paper , we investigated a system of fermionic cold atoms with three internal quantum states and attractive interactions among them .",
    "we have shown by heuristic arguments as well as by a detailed variational calculation in the limit of @xmath278-dimensions that this system shows a quantum phase transition from a correlated superconducting state to a trionic state , where fermions form three - body bound states and the superconducting order disappears .",
    "we also showed that in the case of su(3 ) symmetry , ferromagnetic ordering appears as a secondary order parameter . in a closed system of atoms , where the number of atoms is conserved for every color ,",
    "this implies segregation , i.e. , the formation of domains where the color of the atoms forming the superconducting state changes from domain to domain and the density of the atoms involved in the superconducting order is slightly higher than that of the unpaired ones .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the phase transition is robust against breaking the su(3 ) symmetry of the interaction . this symmetry breaking influences the structure of the superconducting state in that it pins the order parameter to the most strongly interacting channels , but does not influence the existence of the phase transition itself .",
    "we have not studied , however , the case where an unequal number of atoms is loaded for the three hyperfine states .",
    "this situation has been experimentally studied for a two - component @xmath5li system.@xcite there , a segregated superconducting state has been observed in the center of the trap , where the two densities become equal in order to form cooper pairs , while at the edge of the trap , spin densities are different .",
    "a similar scenario is expected for a slight imbalance of the three densities in our case .",

    "formation of a fulde  ferrel  larkin ",
    "ovchinnikov state can not be excluded either , although this state has not been experimentally observed .@xcite    here , we should also remark that we solved the gutzwiller problem only in @xmath63 dimensions , where it predicts a phase transition .",
    "although the phase transition survives in finite dimensions too , there we do not know if the variational gutzwiller wave function displays a phase transition or not .",
    "as long as @xmath65 remains finite , one has a step in the momentum distribution at the fermi energy and the system can gain energy by forming a superconductor .",
    "therefore , to have a phase transition , the parameter @xmath65 must diverge at a finite critical value of @xmath46 .",
    "this certainly happens within the local approximation ( gutzwiller approximation ) in finite dimensions too , and one can argue that this should also happen if one could evaluate the finite - dimensional gutzwiller expectation values exactly . unfortunately , restricted monte carlo calculations would be needed to give a definite answer to this question .",
    "finally , let us briefly discuss how the transition from a superfluid to a trionic state could be experimentally detected .",
    "one way to observe the condensate is by detecting vortices . in a perfectly su(3)-symmetrical system",
    "there are no vortices , because any vortex can be twisted away due to the large internal symmetry of the order parameter.@xcite however , if one breaks the su(3 ) symmetry down to u(1 ) then the superconducting phase will contain usual vortices that can be relatively easily observed optically.@xcite in case of @xmath5li , e.g. , this can be achieved by approaching the feshbach resonance at @xmath279 mt from the high - field side , and thereby having a condensate in channel 12 .",
    "then our prediction is that the superfluid state and thus the vortices disappear for large enough @xmath280 .",
    "this ratio can be tuned by either changing the laser beam intensities and thereby the amplitude of the optical lattice or by changing the external magnetic field",
    ". a further consequence of having @xmath281 is that the interaction induces a chemical potential difference for channels 1 and 2 .",
    "although we do not see a sign of it within the infinite - dimensional gutzwiller approach , this may well render the phase transition first order in finite dimensions .    pinning the order parameter to a single channel",
    "has a further advantage .",
    "since one knows that the order parameter is simply in channel @xmath282 , one can use the method of ref .   to measure @xmath282 by sweeping the magnetic field through the feshbach resonance at @xmath283 and detecting the momentum distribution of the molecules thus formed .",
    "this method would enable one to detect @xmath284 as a function of @xmath280 and verify the existence of a critical value where it goes to zero .",
    "stability of the three - color @xmath5li system may also be an important issue .",
    "high magnetic fields will probably considerably stabilize the three - color condensate , but using mixtures of different fermionic atoms with all scattering lengths being negative may also be a possibility .",
    "in such a composite system , other interesting phenomena could also take place due to the difference in atomic masses .",

    "<S> to investigate ultracold fermionic atoms of three internal states ( colors ) in an optical lattice , subject to strong attractive interaction , we study the attractive three - color hubbard model in infinite dimensions by using a variational approach . </S>",
    "<S> we find a quantum phase transition between a weak - coupling superconducting phase and a strong - coupling trionic phase where groups of three atoms are bound to a composite fermion . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the gutzwiller variational theory can be reformulated in terms of an effective field theory with three - body interactions and how this effective field theory can be solved exactly in infinite dimensions by using the methods of dynamical mean field theory . </S>"
