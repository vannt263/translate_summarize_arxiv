    "dimension reduction techniques have been intensively studied over the last years due to the advent of high - dimensional data in a variety of applied fields . towards an effective reduction dimension ,",
    "it is crucial to interpret correctly what kind of lower dimensional manifold one has to find in order to represent the data properly .",
    "for instance , if the second moment structure reasonable describes the dynamics in the data , then the classical principal component analysis ( henceforth abbreviated by pca ) and its various extensions are the natural candidates to reduce dimensionality .",
    "there are many cases where correlation in high - dimensional systems may not be accurately described by covariance structures .",
    "an important example is the correlation typically found in high - frequency data which is better described by the so - called quadratic variation matrix    @xmath0_t : = [ m^i , m^j]_t ; 1\\le i , j\\le d;0\\le t\\le t,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a @xmath2-dimensional semimartingale sampled over the time horizon @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 $ ] is the quadratic covariation process between @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    ".    in a financial context , the process @xmath7_\\cdot$ ] is called the volatility matrix ( sometimes called integrated volatility ) .",
    "the total amount of volatility in a @xmath2-dimensional semimartingale system over @xmath8 $ ] is fully described by the following quantity @xmath9_t\\|^2_{(2 ) } = \\sum_{j=1}^{d}(\\lambda^j_t)^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 are the random eigenvalues of @xmath7_t$ ] and @xmath11 is the usual hilbert - schmidt norm .",
    "volatility is by far the most important quantity which needs to be estimated for asset pricing , asset allocation and risk management , specially in high - dimensional portfolios .",
    "the estimation of high - dimensional quadratic variation matrices has been a topic of great interest in the last years .",
    "we refer the reader to the works  @xcite and other references therein .    despite all the recent progress on volatility matrix estimation ,",
    "there has been remarkably little fundamental theoretical study on dimension reduction techniques based on high - dimensional quadratic variation matrices .",
    "one notorious difficulty is the dynamic interpretation of directions and principal components over the time horizon which in typical cases is formulated in a high - frequency domain .",
    "indeed , @xmath12_t ; 0\\le t\\le t\\}$ ] is fully random which makes the analysis more evolved than the standard pca .",
    "more precisely , all the potentially optimal projections will be stochastic processes rather than deterministic vectors .    in view of the fact many correlation structures in high - dimensional data",
    "are fully represented by the quadratic variation concept , it is natural and necessary to construct a dimension reduction methodology strictly associated to @xmath7 $ ] rather than on classical covariance or conditional distributions .",
    "this is the program we start to carry out in this paper .",
    "let @xmath13 be a @xmath2-dimensional semimartingale .",
    "the starting point of the analysis is to solve an identification problem related to a possible singularity of the random matrix @xmath7_t$ ] which can be typically found e.g in large portfolios of financial assets ( see e.g burashi , porchia and trojani  @xcite , ait - sahalia and xiu  @xcite and fan , li and yu  @xcite and other references therein ) and affine term structure models  ( see e.g bjork and landn  @xcite and filipovic @xcite and filipovic and sharef  @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , in the presence of non - trivial correlation among semimartingales , one has @xmath14_t",
    "< d~a.s$ ] and then , under mild assumptions , one can split the set @xmath15 into two complementary linear spaces @xmath16 such that    @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 contains only elements of @xmath20 with non - zero and zero quadratic variation , respectively .",
    "the space @xmath18 fully describes the volatility structure of @xmath20 while @xmath19 is responsible for its hidden pure drift ( null quadratic variation ) dynamics . at this point",
    ", we stress that the potential singularity of the quadratic variation matrix @xmath7_t$ ] introduces non - observable drift components into @xmath21 which _ can not _ be discarded in a high - frequency situation .",
    "both spaces are equally important to explain the dynamics of @xmath21 in a given physical probability measure . in strong contrast , directions with null variance can be fully discarded in the classical pca .",
    "this is the first major difference between the classical pca and the theory developed in this article .",
    "we follow the natural and simple idea to seek random variables @xmath22 such that    @xmath23 has the largest possible _ instantaneous _ quadratic variation over @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath24 is interpreted as a _ random coefficient _ at time @xmath25 $ ] rather than a process . by iterating this procedure in an orthogonal way",
    ", we shall get a linear transformation of @xmath21 which under some mild primitive conditions will be a finite - dimensional semimartingale ranked in terms of quadratic variation .",
    "starting with consistent estimators @xmath26}_t$ ] for the quadratic variation matrix @xmath7_t$ ] ( see e.g @xcite and other references therein ) , we are able to propose consistent estimators for @xmath27 by means of a simple eigenvalue analysis of @xmath26}_t$ ] based on high - frequency observations of @xmath21 .",
    "this allows us to reduce dimensionality in terms of quadratic variation in a very clear and consistent way .",
    "equally important , the methodology also estimates bounded variation components in @xmath19 which can not be neglected in multi - dimensional semimartingale systems .",
    "the pca for semimartingales introduced in the first part of the article is applied to the estimation of principal components of discretely - observed space - time semimartingales which describe stochastic partial differential equations ( henceforth abbreviated by stochastic pdes ) admitting finite - dimensional realizations . in particular ,",
    "in the second part of this article , we illustrate the theory by studying the problem of the estimation of the so - called finite - dimensional invariant manifolds w.r.t to a stochastic pde    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is a potentially infinite - dimensional sobolev - type space of continuous functions and @xmath30 satisfy standard assumptions for the existence of solution .",
    "many space - time phenomena in natural and social sciences can be described by solutions of stochastic pdes like ( [ eqpde ] ) .",
    "however , the intrinsic infinite - dimensionality of space - time data generated by models like ( [ eqpde ] ) creates a big challenge in the statistical analysis of these models .",
    "in particular cases , it is well - known that one can reduce dimensionality and still get a very rich class of space - time data generated by models of type ( [ eqpde ] ) .",
    "for instance , under lie algebra conditions ( see filipovic and teichmann @xcite and bjork and svensson  @xcite ) on the coefficients of ( [ eqpde ] ) , it is well known that there exists a family of affine manifolds @xmath31 of curves and a @xmath2-dimensional semimartingale factor process @xmath21 such that    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is a finite - dimensional parameterized family of smooth curves . we shall write it as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a @xmath2-dimensional vector space generated by smooth curves and @xmath36 is an @xmath29-valued smooth parametrization which we assume to be a zero quadratic variation function .    two central unsolved problems in the stochastic pde modelling are : ( i ) the construction of statistical tests to check existence of @xmath37 and ( ii ) the development of related estimation methods .",
    "the importance of this research agenda can be mainly understood in applications to interest rate modelling and other term - structure problems in mathematical finance .",
    "the literature is vast so we refer the reader to e.g  @xcite and other references therein . in short , under the assumption of existence of @xmath37 , the estimation of @xmath35 is essential for a consistent calibration of potentially infinite - dimensional term - structure models .    under the assumption that the stochastic pde ( [ eqpde ] ) admits an affine finite - dimensional representation  ( [ cona ] )",
    ", we apply the semimartingale pca to estimate and identify components of invariant manifolds @xmath37 which depicts volatility and drift dynamics in space .",
    "more precisely , let us consider the finite rank random linear operator @xmath38 defined by    @xmath39 where @xmath40_t ; u , v \\ge \\mathbb{r}_+$ ] , @xmath41 is the inner product of @xmath29 and we set @xmath42 .",
    "we notice the quadratic variation of the stochastic pde ( [ eqpde ] ) is fully generated by @xmath43 .",
    "in particular , the associated hilbert - schmidt norm    @xmath44 fully describes the total amount of energy related to the quadratic variation of ( [ eqpde ] ) over @xmath3 $ ] . here , @xmath45 are the eigenvalues of @xmath43 arranged in decreasing order .    in general , @xmath46 , but in typical situations we do have @xmath47   in case of affine models . from theoretical side , this phenomena is also related to no - arbitrage restrictions imposed on affine models .",
    "see e.g  @xcite and other references therein . ] .",
    "let @xmath48 be the complementary subspace of @xmath49 in @xmath35 .",
    "under mild assumptions , we have the following splitting    @xmath50 in one hand , the pair of subspaces @xmath51 should be considered as the analogous spaces to @xmath27 but in the spatial variable . on the other hand , we stress that @xmath21 is not observed and ( [ cona ] ) is treated as a factor model    @xmath52    with dimension @xmath53 .",
    "the present methodology allows us to estimate and identify directions of the invariant manifold which come from the volatility ( represented by @xmath49 ) and the drift ( represented by @xmath48 ) .",
    "more importantly , we are able to identify them separately which allows us to estimate null and non - null quadratic variation factors by projecting space - time data of the form ( [ spacetimedata ] ) onto a pair of estimated vector spaces @xmath54 .",
    "we consider this separation feature as the most important aspect of the second part of this article . as a by - product ,",
    "our methodology brings two contributions to the field : it provides a consistent volatility dimension reduction and a method to estimate hidden pure drift components in space - time semimartingale data generating processes .",
    "our methodology is a combination of classical factor models jointly with suitable random transformations over the space of latent semimartingales .",
    "more precisely , our approach consists essentially in two steps : firstly , we apply an empirical covariance operator onto the space - time data to obtain a factor decomposition of the form @xmath55 in the spirit of discrete - type factor models ( see e.g stock and watson @xcite , bai  @xcite and bai and ng  @xcite ) , but in a high - frequency setup as opposed to the usual panel data . in other words , @xmath56 is a refining partition of a two - dimensional set @xmath3\\times[a , b]$ ] . in linear structures ,",
    "the covariance operator only neglects components of null empirical variance so that , under suitable conditions , our first step does not loose information from the invariant manifold @xmath57 .",
    "the second step consists in using the semimartingale pca jointly with suitable random rotations of latent factor estimators @xmath58 to infer the underlying semimartingale structure of the data .",
    "it is not easy to foresee that this two - step procedure would work . indeed , to the best of our knowledge it is not known that the covariance operator decomposition is strong enough to provide a resulting process which is amenable to a consistent quadratic variation analysis .",
    "in fact , the sequence @xmath58 is not even associated to a semimartingale , so that the quadratic variation analysis based on this two - step procedure must be considered in a broader sense .",
    "the proof that this strategy works is the content of the second part of the paper .",
    "it is important to stress the both steps in our methodology are equally important .",
    "for instance , the naive application of classical factor models to infer quadratic variation is non - sense when applied to semimartingale systems .",
    "moreover , a more straightforward strategy based directly on an empirical quadratic variation does not work in full generality due to a possible singularity of the matrix .",
    "this last procedure forces the assumptions that @xmath59 which may not be optimal ( in the mean - square sense ) in typical situations when @xmath60 .",
    "this is the reason why the two - step procedure in this work is implemented .",
    "for instance , pelger  @xcite studies principal components directly from the empirical quadratic covariation for factors with jumps and discrete loading factors .",
    "one crucial assumption in his setup is the non - singularity of the quadratic variation matrix which restricts the applicability in multivariate systems with non - trivial correlation typically found in large portfolios and interest rate models .",
    "we should mention that another possible framework is introduced by ait sahalia and xie @xcite who interpret principal component analysis by means of the underlying volatility process .",
    "the main drawback of this strategy is the fact that rank of the volatility matrix may be strictly smaller than @xmath61_t$ ] ( as shown in proposition [ diffusionmatrix ] ) , thus resulting in a substantial underestimation of @xmath62 and their associated factors .",
    "therefore , similar to pelger  @xcite , the strategy introduced by @xcite does not recover in full generality the whole semimartingale stricture ( @xmath20 ) involved in the optimal decomposition due to a possible non - negligible dimension ( @xmath63 associated to the drift . in addition , the strong assumption of simple eigenvalues imposed in @xcite rules out many finite - dimensional semimartingale systems typically found in applications .",

    "<S> in this work , we develop a novel principal component analysis ( pca ) for semimartingales by introducing a suitable spectral analysis for the quadratic variation operator . motivated by high - dimensional complex systems typically found in interest rate markets , we investigate correlation in high - dimensional high - frequency data generated by continuous semimartingales . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the traditional pca methodology , the directions of large variations are not deterministic , but rather they are bounded variation adapted processes which maximize quadratic variation almost surely . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to reduce dimensionality from high - dimensional semimartingale systems in terms of quadratic covariation rather than the usual covariance concept .    </S>",
    "<S> the proposed methodology allows us to investigate space - time data driven by multi - dimensional latent semimartingale state processes . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is applied to discretely - observed stochastic pdes which admit finite - dimensional realizations . in particular , we provide consistent estimators for finite - dimensional invariant manifolds for heath - jarrow - morton models . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , components of the invariant manifold associated to volatility and drift dynamics are consistently estimated and identified . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed methodology is illustrated with both simulated and real data sets .    </S>",
