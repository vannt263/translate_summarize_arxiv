    "the interstellar medium is heated primarily by photons interacting with grains , producing hot electrons by the photoelectric effect ( watson 1972 ) .",
    "other heating is supplied by the excess energy given to electrons detached from atoms during photoionization , and by the excess energy given to atoms during the photodissociation of molecules .",
    "the hot electrons and atoms collide with the thermal particles and add energy . to maintain a steady state , this added energy must be radiated by the gas . the temperature of the gas will increase until the radiation process with lowest excitation threshold becomes effective . in the neutral atomic interstellar medium , the fine structure line of the c@xmath1 ground state with an excitation energy corresponding to 91  k is the first effective cooling channel to open , so the c@xmath1 line at 157.7  @xmath0 m is expected to be strong ( dalgarno & mccray 1972 ) .",
    "the ionization threshold for c is 11.26  ev , so it will be ionized even when h is neutral . o and",
    "n have higher ionization thresholds and will be neutral in h  i regions .",
    "the ground electronic state of o is an inverted fine structure triplet , so the first transition from the ground state corresponds to the 63  @xmath0 m line , and thus requires a considerably higher temperature for excitation .    in the warm ionized medium",
    ", the cno elements will all be singly ionized",
    ". the cooling channel with the lowest excitation energy will be the n@xmath1 line at 205  @xmath0 m , but the 158  @xmath0 m line of c@xmath1 will still be strong . with a typical temperature of a few thousand degrees in the warm ionized medium , there will be many more channels for cooling , so none of these lines will dominate the cooling in the way the c@xmath1 line dominates in h  i regions .    in molecular gas ,",
    "the rotational transitions of the co molecule provide low threshold energy cooling channels .",
    "the density and radiation field in regions with co favor the presence of neutral c instead of c@xmath1 .",
    "the ground electronic state c@xmath2 is a fine structure triplet with lines at 609 and 370  @xmath0 m .    in this paper",
    "i will discuss the observations of these lines by the firas instrument on the _ cobe _ satellite .",
    "these data were first discussed by wright _",
    "( 1991 ) which included the first detection ever of the 205  @xmath0 m n@xmath1 line .",
    "( 1994 ) discuss the distribution of these lines around the sky .",
    "the firas instrument is a polarizing michelson interferometer first described by martin & puplett ( 1970 ) . using free - standing wire grids as polarizers allows a single instrument to measure many octaves of spectrum at once .",
    "figure [ gc_lh.eps ] shows spectra of the galactic center pixel and the pixel with the lowest @xmath11 ( lockman , jahoda and mccammon 1986 ) taken from the right high channel of firas .",
    "the high frequency part of the spectrum ( @xmath12  cm@xmath9 ) was separated from the cosmic signal by a dichroic beamsplitter , but the residual reflectance of this filter allows one to see most of cosmic blackbody spectrum as well .    the firas instrument uses bolometric detectors , and is thus approximately equally sensitive to lines at any frequency .",
    "however , variations of filter transmission and modulation efficiency modify this equality and must be determined using calibration observations .",
    "the in - flight calibrators are essentially blackbodies , while the galactic spectrum is a very dilute modified planck function .",
    "thus the 50 part per million precision achieved in the search for deviations of the cmb from a blackbody ( fixsen _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) does not imply 50 part per million precision in the galactic dust and line fluxes .",
    "in particular , small ripples in the gain calibration could be confused with weak line fluxes in regions where the continuum is high .    the bright c@xmath1 and n@xmath1 lines are easily visible in the spectrum of the galactic center , and by fitting a line profile plus baseline to the spectrum of each pixel , maps can be generated .",
    "figure [ cplus3.eps ] shows a map of the c@xmath1 line flux .",
    "higher snr on the galactic signal can be obtained by averaging all of the pixels together .",
    "but an arbitrary isotropic signal must be included in the fit , as well as the dipole variation of the cmb temperature .",
    "the following approach was used :    1 .   make maps of the cosmic temperature variation and the galactic dust distribution using an initial guess for the mean galactic spectrum , @xmath14 : @xmath15 2 .",
    "do a spectral fit to derive the isotropic cosmic spectrum , @xmath16 ; the spectrum of the dipole , @xmath17 ; and the mean spectrum of the galaxy , @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the angle between the los @xmath21 and the hot pole of the dipole .",
    "3 .   iterate using @xmath18 instead of @xmath14 .",
    "this procedure can be applied to a subset of the sky as well .",
    "note that changes in the isotropic spectrum have no effect of the derived @xmath18 , which is determined solely from the variations of the spectrum with position on the sky .",
    "wright _ et al . _",
    "( 1991 ) applied this procedure to the early data from firas , and obtained a map of @xmath22 over part of the sky and a spectrum @xmath18 which was analyzed for line strengths and dust emission parameters .",
    "figure [ dust3.eps ] shows @xmath22 for the entire firas data set .",
    "note that the polar flux ( slope with respect to @xmath23 ) is 0.05 units on this map .",
    "the spectrum @xmath18 derived only from data taken away from the galactic plane is given by fixsen _",
    "figure [ g_resids.eps ] shows this @xmath18 after a modified planck function is subtracted .",
    "the 3 - 2 and 4 - 3 co lines have about the same strength in this spectrum as they do in the all - sky @xmath18 , while the 5 - 4 line is stronger .",
    "however , the snr of this spectrum is quite low since all of the strong galactic signal has been ignored .",
    "firas detected the co lines from 2 - 1 to 5 - 4 . in terms of power in erg / sec ,",
    "the 5 - 4 line is quite strong .",
    "the excitation of co to the @xmath24 level which has a radiative lifetime of only one day would seem to be quite difficult in the high galactic latitude molecular clouds seen by magnani , blitz and mundy ( 1985 ) .",
    "this excitation looks more reasonable if the co line strengths are plotted in units of k - km / sec , as shown as in figure [ co_fit.eps ] .",
    "the almost perfect fit of these line strengths to @xmath25 ( dashed line ) suggests a thermal distribution , but since the energy of the co levels is @xmath26 a mixture of temperatures is needed : the solid curve shows a model of optically thin co with 88% at 5  k and 12% at 19  k. while this gives a good fit , the number of parameters equals the number of detected lines , so there are no remaining degrees of freedom .",
    "this two temperature model predicts a co 1 - 0 line flux of 0.15 k - km / sec at the galactic pole",
    ". the standard ratio of co 1 - 0 line flux to molecular hydrogen column density , @xmath27@xmath28k@xmath6km / sec@xmath29 ( young & scoville 1991 ) , gives @xmath30 so this molecular gas is about 1/3 of the atomic gas at high latitudes .",
    "blitz , bazell & desert ( 1990 ) estimate that the mass of the high latitude molecular clouds is 33% of the neutral atomic mass , implying that the firas co flux is due to the smeared out emission from the mbm clouds .",
    "the high latitude co clouds have lower densities and lower extinctions than most molecular clouds , so a fluorescent cascade following vibrational or electronic excitation could provide most of the high-@xmath31 co.",
    "the firas data on the milky way show the primary cooling mechanisms in the ism .",
    "99.7% of the power is radiated by dust heated directly by the interstellar radiation field .",
    "gas in the ism radiates 0.3% of the power in the c@xmath1 line at 158  @xmath0 m .",
    "the next most luminous species seen by firas is n@xmath1 , with 0.03% of the power in the 205  @xmath0 m line .",
    "c@xmath2 and co each radiate about 0.003% of the total power .",
    "wright first , we do not claim the absorption at @xmath32 is real .",
    "but if it is , the line strengths shown in figure 2 of bennett _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) imply an equivalent width of @xmath34  cm@xmath9 for the para line at 269.3  @xmath0 m while the ortho line at 538.3  @xmath0 m has @xmath35  cm@xmath9 .",
    "a given equivalent width in the ortho line implies 4 times more column density than the same equivalent width in the para line because the frequency is half as large and the transition matrix element @xmath36 is half as large .",
    "thus ortho : para column density ratios ranging from 0 to more than 3:1 are all consistent with these equivalent widths",
    ". if both lines are optically thick , as seems likely , then @xmath37 should be one half of @xmath38 because of the frequency factor , which is also consistent with the observations . in the optically thick case",
    "we have no information on the ortho : para ratio .",
