    "<S> the time evolution depends solely on the current state of the system , and there are several results concerning its quantum simulation  @xcite . on the contrary , the non - markovian evolution depends on the history of the system , and it is more challenging to treat both analytically and numerically  @xcite . in this sense , despite some recent results  @xcite , including a work on the sufficient conditions for a completely positive and trace preserving ( cptp ) non - markovian dynamics @xcite , a general non - markovian quantum simulator has not been fully developed yet . </S>",
