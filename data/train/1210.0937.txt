    "in teleparallel gravity @xcite , the gravitational interaction is described using torsion , instead of the curvature used in general relativity ; and instead of the torsion - less levi - civita connection , curvature - less weitzenbck @xcite connection is employed .",
    "the gravitational action of this model is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 , and the metric components are related to tetrad via @xmath4 in ( [ 1 ] ) , the torsion scalar @xmath5 is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is torsion of the weitzenbck connection , and @xmath8 is the contorsion tensor .",
    "a candidate to describe the present accelerated expansion of our universe@xcite , is the modified theory of gravity @xcite . in modified theories based on general relativity ,",
    "the gravitational action @xmath9 is replaced by @xmath10 .",
    "inspired by this model modified teleparallel gravity has been proposed to study the acceleration expansion of our universe @xcite .",
    "this model is described @xmath11 where @xmath12 is matter action .    in some papers ,",
    "the form of @xmath0 is suggested and then its cosmological consequences are investigated @xcite . in some other papers ,",
    "the hubble parameter or the behavior of the effective energy density is specified and then using modified friedmann equations , the form of @xmath0 is obtained @xcite .",
    "another way to determine a specific form for @xmath0 , is to use symmetries of the problem .",
    "noether symmetry provides us a mean to get some insights about the form of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this method was used to determine the form of the potential in quintessence model , and to specify the modifications in modified theories of gravity @xcite . in the aforementioned papers ,",
    "the studies were restricted to noether symmetries corresponding to vector fields whose coefficients were assumed to depend only on time and coordinates ( in configuration space ) . in generalized symmetries ,",
    "the coefficient functions of the vector fields contain first and higher order time derivatives of coordinates .",
    "in this situation , a generalization of noether theorem can be realized . to see a discussion about this case",
    "see @xcite , where the generalized noether symmetry and their corresponding generalized vector fields are studied . to have an insight of this subject ,",

    "the structure of the manuscript is as follows : in the second section after some preliminaries , we introduce the lagrangian formalism for modified teleparallel gravity .",
    "we assume that the dominant matter component is cold dark matter . based on generalized noether theorem",
    ", we introduce a generalized vector field and obtain a system of partial differential equations for the coefficients and the function @xmath1 . in the third section , the system of differential equations is solved and based on explicit form derived for @xmath0 , and integrals of motion , some cosmological consequences of the obtained results are discussed .",
    "we use units @xmath15 through the paper .",
    "we consider a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) space time in comoving coordinates @xmath16 @xmath17 is the scale factor and in terms of the hubble parameter , @xmath18 , the scalar torsion ( [ 3 ] ) is given by @xmath19 the modified friedmann equation is @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and the effective dark energy density is @xmath22 the raychaudhury equation is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is matter pressure .",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath24 satisfy the continuity equation @xmath26 the equation of state parameter ( eos ) of the universe can be written as @xmath27 we assume that the matter component is dominated by cold dark matter characterized by @xmath28 , leading to @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a constant . by adopting a suitable lagrangian @xcite @xmath31 in the configuration space @xmath32 , the euler lagrange equation @xmath33 results in @xmath34 , when @xmath35 the modified raychoudhury equation ( [ 13 ] ) is deduced from @xmath36 .",
    "the modified friedmann equation is emerged from the hamiltonian constraint @xcite .",
    "indeed @xmath37 gives @xmath38 which is the same as ( [ 11 ] ) rewritten for cold dark matter .",
    "a generalized vector field is expressed as @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are smooth functions of @xmath42 , @xmath43 canonical coordinates @xmath44 , and their first and higher order time derivatives .",
    "@xmath45 is the generator of a variational symmetry of the lagrangian iff there there exists a continuous function @xmath46 such that @xmath47 where the first prolongation of @xmath45 is @xmath48 inspired by ( [ 8 ] ) , and for the sake of simplicity , in the same manner as @xcite , we restrict ourselves to the case where the coefficients are linear in the velocities @xmath49 the noether integral is @xmath50 by putting ( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 22 ] ) in ( [ 20 ] ) , and equating expressions containing the same order of time derivatives of @xmath17 and @xmath5 in both sides , we get : @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a continuous function , and also a system of differential equations : @xmath54 the integral of motion is @xmath55",
    "@xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 do not involve in the three last equations in ( [ 26 ] ) .",
    "these three equations are sufficient to determine the form of @xmath0 if either of @xmath60 and @xmath61 is non zero . in this situation one",
    "obtains a power law expression for @xmath62 , which using ( [ 1000 ] ) leads to @xmath63 whose the cosmological consequences are discussed in @xcite . in this case by solving ( [ 26 ] ) , an additional noether symmetry corresponding to the the generalized vector field specified by @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 is an arbitrary continuous function , is attained .    for @xmath67 ,",
    "obtaining an analytical solution for the system ( [ 26 ] ) is very complicated , if not impossible .",
    "so to go further , one should examine specific cases .",
    "here we consider solutions characterized by @xmath68 . by this simplification",
    "the following specific solutions for @xmath0 are derived ( using the maple 13 pdetools package ) : @xmath69 which are not acceptable because the first one is not consistent with @xmath70 used in our procedure , and the second one when inserted in ( [ 1000 ] ) gives @xmath71 , which does not describe cold dark matter .",
    "the third specific solution is @xmath72 with the condition @xmath73 implying that @xmath74 is real .",
    "for this solution , the noether integral is @xmath75 which can be rewritten as @xmath76 where the constant @xmath77 is defined by @xmath78 .    by using ( [ 1000 ] ) and after some computations we obtain @xmath79 , where @xmath80 , leading to @xmath81 dimensionless parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 are defined through @xmath84 ; @xmath85 .",
    "we use @xmath86 instead of the cosmic time and dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath87 is considered .",
    "( [ 31 ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath88 and ( [ 34 ] ) implies @xmath89    to see whether the phantom divide line ( @xmath90 ) crossing is allowed in this model , we must compute @xmath91 . using ( [ 34 ] ) , after some calculations , we obtain @xmath92 therefore the transition from @xmath93 to @xmath94 and vice versa are not possible . in the following we consider @xmath93 which corresponds to @xmath95 .",
    "( [ 35 ] ) leads to @xmath96 . to study the cosmological consequences of this model we try to solve the differential equation ( [ 34 ] ) , with the constraint @xmath97 .",
    "we write ( [ 34 ] ) as @xmath98 whose solution is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a constant . using @xmath101",
    "one obtains @xmath102 as @xmath103 is a decreasing function of @xmath104 , we expect that @xmath103 becomes negative after some time , dubbed as turnaround time ( see fig(1 ) and fig(2 ) ) .",
    "this turnaround occurs at @xmath105 as crossing the phantom divide line is not permitted , the hubble parameter continues to decrease and reach at @xmath106 asymptotically .    to study the acceleration of the universe , we consider @xmath107 which has the same sign as @xmath108 .",
    "@xmath109 occurs at the times @xmath110 and @xmath111 specified by @xmath112 to elucidate the behavior of @xmath113 , we compute @xmath114 at these points .",
    "the result is @xmath115 which shows that in this model the universe has a positive acceleration ( in the sense that @xmath116 ) for @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "for @xmath119 we have @xmath120 .",
    "so far , as we have not fixed the values of @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath100 , our discussions and results were general . to be more specific",
    ", we must put some physical conditions on these parameters . to do so , we consider the effective eos parameter of dark sector , @xmath121 , where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the effective pressure and energy density attributed to modified teleparallel gravity respectively @xcite .",
    "we also consider the relative densities defined by @xmath124 , and @xmath125 .",
    "the relative dark matter density can be written as @xmath126 using @xmath127@xcite , and @xmath128 , we obtain @xmath129 equations ( [ 46 ] ) and ( [ 47 ] ) provide us a tool to determine the parameters of the model .",
    "we take the present time to be at @xmath130 and take @xcite @xmath131 as initial conditions ( i.e. conditions respected by the model in a specific time , e.g. the present epoch ) . by solving ( [ 48 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath82 and @xmath83 are obtained in terms of @xmath100 as @xmath132 or @xmath133 where @xmath134 , denotes lambert@xmath134 function .",
    "our choices for @xmath100 may be restricted by adopting further conditions .",
    "one of these conditions may be that the dark sector of the universe encounters a phase transition from @xmath135 to @xmath136 in the present era , implying @xmath137 we must also take into account @xmath138 and @xmath139 , corresponding to the fact that the present expansion of the universe has a positive acceleration .",
    "as an illustration of our results , in fig.([fig1 ] ) ( fig.([fig2 ] ) ) , @xmath113 and @xmath103 are depicted in terms of @xmath104 , for @xmath140 and for solutions with negative ( positive ) sign in ( [ 39 ] ) .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) , as is related to a contacting universe at @xmath130 , does not represent our actual universe . in fig.([fig1 ] ) , we have @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the value of the hubble parameter at the present era @xcite .",
    "as we have not taken @xmath143 , @xmath30 must not be confused with the value of matter density at the present time .",
    "note that , the qualitative behaviors of @xmath103 and @xmath113 in these figures are consistent with was discussed after eq.([45 ] ) , and do not depend on the specific values of the parameters . but as we have shown , astrophysical data , by fixing the initial conditions , put some quantitative constraints on these behaviors .",
    "the explicit form of crossing the line @xmath144 , in the present era , is depicted in fig.([fig3 ] ) .",
    "this figure shows that , by a suitable choice of the parameter @xmath100 , the dark sector can exhibit a transition from @xmath135 to @xmath136 in the present era .",
    "the modified teleparallel gravity ( @xmath0 model of gravity ) is a framework to study the present accelerated expansion of the universe . to determine the form of @xmath0",
    ", one can use the noether symmetry .",
    "this method was vastly used in the literature to specify the form of modifications in modify theories of gravity as well as to determine the form of the scalar field potential in dark energy models . in @xcite , where the coefficients of vector fields are taken to be functions of coordinates , only one form for @xmath0",
    "is deduced : @xmath62 , where @xmath145 and @xmath43 are two real numbers .",
    "the scale factor is @xmath146 and consequently the hubble parameter is obtained as @xmath147 .",
    "therefore the eos parameter of the universe is a constant @xmath148 , so @xmath149 results in an eternal acceleration for the expanding universe .    in this paper , this approach was extended to the generalized noether symmetry where the coefficients of generalized vector fields contain the terms linear in velocities ( time derivative of configuration space coordinates ) . in our study , we assumed that the matter component of the universe is dominated by cold dark matter . beside the solution of @xcite",
    ", we obtained new explicit forms for @xmath0 ( see ( [ 30 ] ) ) .",
    "the novel aspects of these solutions are that the eos parameter of the universe is no more a constant , and besides a turn around , the universe encounters successive acceleration deceleration phases in the era where the matter component is dominated by cold dark matter .",
    "in our model the universe can not cross the phantom divide line .",
    "indeed , as was explained , we have always @xmath150 , whence @xmath151 . despite this , the eos parameter of the dark sector , namely @xmath152 , may be lower than or equal to @xmath153 , and @xmath135 to @xmath136 transition , as illustrated in fig.([fig3 ] ) , may occur in our present era .",
    "this characteristic is absent in some previous frameworks where an exponential form , or other forms inspired by viable @xmath154 gravities , for @xmath0 were proposed @xcite . as a summary , on the base of fundamental symmetry theories , generalizing the noether symmetry",
    "provides us a mean to obtain new forms for @xmath0 , which may be physically more viable .    in our study",
    "the coefficients in vector fields were linear in the velocities ( see eq.([22 ] ) ) . by adopting more generalized form of vector fields",
    ", it may be quite possible to obtain new @xmath0 models which may be more consistent with astrophysical data .",
    "however , due to computational hurdles , finding analytical solutions in these cases is very complicated .",
