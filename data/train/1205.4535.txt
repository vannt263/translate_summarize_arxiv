    "this quest came from the formulation of quantitative measures of the degree of non - markovianity of a process  @xcite .",
    "in general , these tools address different _ features _ of non - markovianity , from the lack of divisibility of a map  @xcite to the ability of the environment to reciprocate the information transfer from the system .",
    "this process occurs unidirectionally in a markovian dynamics  @xcite , while the re - focusing of information on the system is the signature of memory effects , as verified in all - optical set - ups  @xcite .",
    "the handiness of such instruments has recently triggered the analysis of non - markovianity in quantum many - body systems such as quantum spin chains  @xcite or impurity - embedded ultra - cold atomic systems  @xcite and in excitation - transfer processes in photosynthetic complexes  @xcite .",
    "while these studies relate non - markovian features to the critical behavior of a quantum many - body system  @xcite , they also provide a promising arena where the roots for non - markovianity can be researched in physically motivated contexts .    in this paper",
    "we explore the competition between two profoundly different mechanisms in a simple open quantum model that is relevant for the physics of nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamonds  @xcite and molecular nanomagnets  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we address the interplay between the dynamics induced on a two - level system by its coherent interaction with other ( environmental ) spins , and the markovian process describing the relaxation of the latter .",
    "one would expect that , when such memoryless dissipative coupling determines the shortest dynamical timescale of the system , markovianity should emerge preponderantly , especially as the number of environmental spins increases .",
    "indeed , one could imagine that a sort of `` markovianity - mixing '' property would hold as a result of the increasing difficulty to re - build the coherence of the system when many decoherence channels are open .",
    "quite strikingly , we show that this is not generally true . in order to do this using a physically relevant model , general enough to encompass",
    "the unexpected features that we would like to highlight , we consider a spin - star configuration whose peripheral sites are coupled to _ rigid _ boson environments , assumed to induce a memoryless dissipative dynamics . while certainly not exhausting the possible scenarios that can be tackled , our choice is illustrative since the degree of non - markovianity ( as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite ) _ can actually increase _ with the number of peripheral spins , while stronger interactions with the boson baths only affect its rate of growth .",
    "the features of the system at hand are quite complex and a rich non - markovianity phase diagram emerges , spanning degrees of memory - keeping effects all the way down to zero values .",
    "this can be exploited to qualitatively modify the character of the dynamics by engineering its features via accessible control parameters such as the detuning between the central and the outer spins . in turn , this opens up the possibility to implement qubit - state preparation protocols in an open - system scenario that exploits non - markovinity , along the lines of refs .",
