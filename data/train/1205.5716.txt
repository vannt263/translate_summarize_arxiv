    "the hii regions ionised by stars ( or star clusters ) form a well - defined fundamental sequence in different emission - line diagrams .",
    "the existence of such a fundamental sequence provides the basis of various investigations of extragalactic hii regions .",
    "in particular , @xcite suggested that the position of an object in some well - chosen emission - line diagrams can be used to separate hii regions ionised by stars from other types of emission - line objects .",
    "this idea has found general acceptance and is widely used .",
    "thus , the [ oiii]@xmath15007/h@xmath2 vs.  [ nii]@xmath16584/h@xmath3 diagram is often used to distinguish between hii regions and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",

    "thus , at the present time there exists no absolute scale for metallicities in hii regions .",
    "the empirical metallicity scale has advantages as compared to the theoretical ( model ) metallicity scales .",
    "the empirical metallicity scale is well defined in terms of the abundances in hii regions derived through the @xmath4 method , i.e. , in that sense the empirical metallicity scale is absolute .",
    "the abundances estimated via different empirical calibrations are compatible with each other and with the @xmath4-based abundances as well .",
    "contrary to the consistency among empirical calibrations , there are as many theoretical ( model ) metallicity scales as there are sets of hii region models .",
    "in other words , the abundances derived using different theoretical calibrations are usually not in agreement with each other .",
    "however , the validity of the @xmath4 method ( and , as a consequence , the validity of the empirical metallicity scale in hii regions ) has for long been questioned ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "but there is also evidence that the classic @xmath4 method provides realistic oxygen abundances of hii regions @xcite .",
    "it is also noteworthy that oxygen abundances in galactic hii regions derived using the direct @xmath4 method as well as empirical calibrations agree with stellar oxygen abundances ( see , e.g. , fig . 7 in",
    "* ) determined in cepheids @xcite as well as the new solar oxygen abundance @xcite",
    ". moreover , if the empirical metallicity scale should be corrected ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the abundances derived using the @xmath4 method and different empirical calibrations should be corrected accordingly .",
    "thus , the empirical metallicity scale is likely the preferable metallicity scale at present .",
    "however , all calibrations ( empirical as well as theoretical ) encounter problems .",
    "these calibrations are usually based on the oxygen [ oii]@xmath13727+@xmath13729 , [ oiii]@xmath15007 and/or nitrogen [ nii]@xmath16584 lines [ with a few exceptions , e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "it is well known that the relation between the oxygen abundance and the strong oxygen - line intensities is double - valued , with two distinct parts , traditionally known as the upper ( 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath5 8.25 ) and lower ( 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath6 8.0 ) branches of the r@xmath7  o / h diagram . moreover , the strong oxygen - line intensities are not a good indicator of the oxygen abundance in the transition zone between the upper and lower branches .    furthermore , it is well known that there is no one - to - one correspondence between oxygen and nitrogen abundances .",
    "a prominent feature of the n / o vs. o / h diagram is that the n / o abundance ratio shows a large scatter at a fixed value of the o / h abundance ratio , larger than can be explained by observational uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the n / o  o / h relation shows also a clear bend : while at low metallicities ( 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath6 8.0 ) the n / o abundance ratio is , on average , constant , the n / o ratio increases with o / h at high metallicities ( 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath5 8.0 ) .",
    "the properties mentioned above prevent the construction of a calibration that works over the whole range of metallicities shown by hii regions .",
    "thus , one has to construct separate calibrations for different metallicity intervals , i.e. , there are no calibration relations that work sufficiently well over the whole range of observed metallicities . here , also another problem arises  one has to know _ a priori _ in which metallicity interval ( or on which of the two branches ) the hii region is located .",
    "it should be emphasised that each existing calibration is based on the assumption that hii regions with similar strong - line intensities have similar abundances . a simple",
    ", more direct method for abundance determination follows from that assumption as well .",
    "if there were ( and fortunately there is indeed ) a suitable sample of reference hii regions with well - measured electron temperatures and abundances , then one can choose among those reference hii regions the ones that have the smallest difference in strong line intensities compared to the studied hii region , i.e. , one can find a corresponding , `` counterpart '' hii region . then the oxygen and nitrogen abundances and electron temperatures in the investigated hii region can be assumed to be the same as in its counterpart .",
    "in other words , we suggest that the abundances in the target hii region can be determined `` by precedent '' . to obtain more reliable abundances ,",
    "one may select several reference hii regions ( counterparts ) and then estimate the abundance in the target hii region through extrapolation or interpolation .",
    "we will refer to this method as the `` counterpart method '' or , for brevity , as the @xmath0 method .",

    ", the number of available spectra of emission - line nebulae has increased dramatically due to several large spectroscopic surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "the auroral lines are measurable in a relatively large number of sdss galaxies @xcite , which provides the possibility to obtain @xmath4-based abundances for sdss galaxies .",
    "however , the sdss objects can not be used as reference hii regions for two reasons .",
    "first , the wavelength range of the sdss spectra is 3800  9300   so that for nearby galaxies with redshift @xmath23 the [ oii]@xmath13727+@xmath13729 emission line is outside of that range .",
    "the lack of this line prevents us from using sdss spectra of nearby galaxies in our study .",
    "second , the sdss galaxy spectra span a large range of redshifts .",
    "there is thus an aperture - redshift effect in sdss spectra since these spectra are obtained with @xmath24-diameter fibers . at a redshift of @xmath25",
    "the projected aperture diameter is @xmath26 3 kpc , while it is @xmath26 15 kpc at a redshift of @xmath27 .",
    "this means that , at large redshifts , sdss spectra are closer to global spectra of whole galaxies , i.e. , to spectra of composite nebulae including multiple star clusters , rather than to spectra of individual hii regions .",
    "it has been argued that the @xmath4 method can result in an underestimated oxygen abundance in the sdss objects if hii regions with different physical properties contribute to the global spectrum of composite nebulae @xcite .",
    "this effect is somewhat similar to the small - scale temperature fluctuations in hii regions discussed by @xcite .",

    "<S> we suggest a new way of the determining abundances and electron temperatures in hii regions from strong emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on the standard assumption that hii regions with similar intensities of strong emission lines have similar physical properties and abundances . </S>",
    "<S> a `` counterpart '' for a studied hii region may be chosen among hii regions with well - measured abundances ( reference hii regions ) by comparison of carefully chosen combinations of strong line intensities . </S>",
    "<S> then the abundances in the investigated hii region can be assumed to be the same as those in its counterpart . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest to determine the abundances in hii regions `` by precedent '' . to get more reliable abundances for the considered hii region , </S>",
    "<S> a number of reference hii regions is selected and then the abundances in the target hii region are estimated through extra-/interpolation . </S>",
    "<S> we will refer to this method of abundance determination as the counterpart method or , for brevity , the @xmath0 method . </S>",
    "<S> we define a sample of reference hii regions and verify the validity of the @xmath0 method . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this method produces reliable abundances . </S>",
