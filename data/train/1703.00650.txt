    "su uma - type dwarf novae are a class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) which show superhumps during long - lasting outbursts called superoutbursts [ for general information of cvs , dwarf novae and su uma - type dwarf novae and superhumps , see e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "these superhumps and superoutbursts are now considered to be a consequence of the 3:1 resonance between the rotation in the accretion disk and the secondary star ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such a resonance can occur when the mass - ratio ( @xmath1 ) of the binary is small enough to accommodate a large accretion disk .",
    "it had long been known that su uma - type dwarf novae are restricted to objects below the famous cv period gap [ cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for the period gap and modern summary of cv evolution ] .",
    "the only well - established exception was , and has long been , one of the earliest known su uma - type dwarf novae , tu men ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , whose orbital period ( @xmath2 ) and superhump period ( @xmath3 ) are 0.1172  d and 0.1257  d , respectively @xcite .",
    "the lack of su uma - type dwarf novae above the period gap impressed many researchers and led @xcite to propose his idea of tidal instability and its stability condition .",
    "although more than 700 su uma - type dwarf novae have been identified at the time of writing ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , tu men , together with the recently reported faint object ogle - gd - dn-009 [ @xmath3=0.1310(3 )  d , @xcite ] , have been the only objects above the period gap . here",
    ", we report on the discovery of an su uma - type dwarf nova which has the longest @xmath3 .",
    "ot j002656.6@xmath0284933 ( hereafter ot j002656 ) was discovered as a possible dwarf nova by the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ; @xcite)http://nesssi.cacr.caltech.edu / catalina/@xmath4 .",
    "for the information of the individual catalina cvs , see @xmath5http://nesssi.cacr.caltech.edu / catalina / allcv.html@xmath4 . ] on 2010 december 12 at an unfiltered ccd magnitude of 18.52 with the detection name css101212:002657@xmath0284933.http://nesssi.cacr.caltech.edu/catalina/20101212/1012121290034112135.html@xmath4 . ] due to the faintness , this object did not receive much attention at the time of this discovery .",
    "there was a faint , blue ( @xmath6=21.6 , @xmath7=@xmath80.2 ) sdss counterpart sdss j002656.59@xmath0284932.9 @xcite and a galex counterpart with a near ultraviolet ( nuv ) magnitude of 21.5(3 ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated the orbital period to be 0.165(13 )  d from sdss colors using a neural network .",
    "the object was also recorded in outburst at @xmath9=15.65 on 2002 july 22 by the carlsberg meridian telescope @xcite .",
    "the object was reported to be in a bright ( @xmath10=15.5 ) outburst on 2013 july 6 by the asas - sn @xcite team ( vsnet - alert 15926 ) .",
    "this outburst , however , did not receive special attention .",
    "the dwarf nova - type classification has become certain after these multiple outburst detections .    the object received attention by the detection of another bright outburst ( @xmath10=14.95 ) on 2016 october 23 by the asas - sn cv patrol @xcitehttp://cv.asassn.astronomy.ohio - state.edu/@xmath4 . ] . the past light curve in the asas - sn cv patrolhttp://cv.asassn.astronomy.ohio - state.edu / outbursts@xmath4 by searching using the name css101212:002657@xmath0284933 .",

    "strongly suggested that the 2013 july outburst bore characteristics of a superoutburst ( vsnet - alert 20258 ) and an observational campaign of the 2016 outburst was launched .",
    "subsequent observations detected superhumps ( vsnet - alert 20265 ) , which further developed into our familiar superhumps with an astonishingly long ( @xmath110.13  d ; figure [ fig : j0026shsamp ] ; e - figure 1 ) @xmath3 ( vsnet - alert 20271 ) .",
    "further observations confirmed the long - period nature of this object ( vsnet - alert 20279 , 20286 , 20310 , 20326 , 20331 ) .",
    "the resultant period was longer than that of tu men .",
    "the observations were carried out as in many campaigns ( e.g. @xcite ) led by the vsnet collaboration @xcite .",
    "the observers used 2060 cm telescopes during the outburst and a 1.25-m telescope ( nauchny , crimea ) after the superoutburst ( november 30 and december 5 ) .",
    "all observers used unfiltered ccd cameras except one run in the @xmath10-band on november 4 ( e - table 1 ) .",
    "they used aperture photometry and extracted magnitudes relative to comparison stars whose constancy has been confirmed by comparison with check stars .",
    "the remaining small zero - point differences between observers were corrected by adding constants to minimize the scatter .",
    "the analysis of superhumps was performed in the same way as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we mainly used r softwarehttp://cran.r - project.org/@xmath4 . ] for data analysis . in de - trending the data , we divided the data into three segments in relation to the outburst phase and used locally - weighted polynomial regression ( lowess : @xcite , using a smoothing parameter @xmath12=0.1 ) for the superoutburst plateau and the post - superoutburst period . for a rapidly fading short segment , we used a linear fit to remove the trend .",
    "the times of superhumps maxima were determined by the template fitting method as described in @xcite .",
    "the times of all observations are expressed in barycentric julian days ( bjd ) .",
    "as shown in the upper panel of figure [ fig : j0026humpall ] , the object showed the superoutburst plateau until bjd 2457703 ( 2016 november 10 ) and then started fading quickly .",
    "the superoutburst lasted for at least 18  d. although there was a gap in the observation for the four subsequent nights due to the interference by the bright moon close to this object , we are confident that the object should have faded further since the object was observed to be fading quickly on the final night ( bjd 2457705 ) of the main superoutburst .",
    "the object underwent a post - superoutburst rebrightening on bjd 2457710 ( november 17 ; e - figure 2 ) and smoothly faded .",
    "quite astonishingly , the object had yet another rebrightening on bjd 2457718 ( november 25 ) .",
    "between these rebrightenings , the object remained brighter than 19.5 mag , which is 2 mag brighter than in quiescence ( as inferred from the sdss magnitudes ) .",
    "following the second rebrightening , the object became very faint ( fainter than magnitude 20 , not plotted in the figure ) and it was likely that the object returned to quiescence .",
    "the times of superhump maxima during the superoutburst plateau are listed in e - table 2 . the @xmath13 diagram ( middle panel of figure [ fig : j0026humpall ] )",
    "shows our familiar pattern of stages a and b , characterized by a rising slope ( stage a ) and a quadratic curvature ( stage b ) as illustrated in figure 4 in @xcite for short-@xmath3 su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "diagram to identify these stages . ]",
    "stage c ( segment with a shorter period following stage b ) was absent or it occurred in the observational gap .",
    "it was , however , certain that stage b to c transition did not occur before the end of the superoutburst plateau . using the segment before bjd 2457691.6 , which corresponds to stage a in the @xmath13 diagram",
    ", we obtained a superhump period of 0.13320(3 )  d by the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) method @xcite ( e - figure 3 ) .    by using the segment 30@xmath14112 ( which is well approximated by a parabola in the @xmath13 diagram )",
    ", we obtained a positive period derivative of @xmath15 = @xmath016.4(1.6 ) @xmath16 10@xmath17 .",
    "the mean superhump period in this segment was 0.13225(1 )  d ( e - figure 4 ) .",
    "since stage a was not very well observed and the resultant period may have already been affected by stage b superhumps , we independently estimated the period of stage a superhumps by using an empirical relation that the period of stage a superhumps is 1.01.5% longer than that of averaged stage b superhumps @xcite [ this relation has been confirmed in @xcite for well - observed systems ] .",
    "this method gives a period of 0.133560.13422  d. since the lower limit is close to our direct estimate , we used the upper limit as our upper - limit estimate of the period of stage a superhumps .",
    "the superhump signal persisted after the first rebrightening ( see e - table 3 ; e - figure 2 ) .",
    "we used the segment before bjd 2457716 . the superhump period after bjd 2457710 by the pdm method was 0.13192(7 )  d ( e - figure 5 ) .",
    "when we restricted the analysis after bjd 2457711 and 2457712 , we obtained periods of 0.13183(6 )  d and 0.13174(6 )  d , respectively .",
    "these values do not greatly differ from each other , and we adopted a period of 0.1318(1 )  d for the period after the initial rebrightening .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , we can estimate the mass ratio from the fractional superhump excess of stage a superhumps against the orbital period . in the case of ot j002656 ,",
    "the orbital period is unknown .",
    "in such a case , we can constrain the mass ratio by using the periods of stage a superhumps and post - superoutburst superhumps .",
    "the dynamical precession rate , @xmath18 in the disk can be expressed by ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath9 are the angular orbital frequency and the dimensionless radius measured in units of the binary separation @xmath21 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath22 and @xmath9 are @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the laplace coefficient @xmath26 this @xmath27 is equal to the fractional superhump excess in frequency : @xmath28 .    following the treatment in @xcite",
    ", we can describe : @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the radius of the 3:1 resonance @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the fractional superhump excess and disk radius soon after the the superoutburst , respectively . by solving equations ( [ equ : epsstagea ] ) and",
    "( [ equ : epspost ] ) simultaneously , we can obtain the relation between @xmath34 and @xmath22 .",
    "if we have knowledge about @xmath34 , we have a more stringent constraint .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : qrpost ] .",
    "the measurements of @xmath34 in su uma - type dwarf novae using the same method are within the range of 0.30 and 0.38 @xcite .",
    "the smaller values represent the values for wz sge - type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings ( after such rebrightenings ) .",
    "it is highly unlikely that @xmath34 is larger than 0.38 in ot j002656 , and it is expected to be somewhat smaller than 0.38 since the object experienced a rebrightening at the time of our measurement , although it was not after the final rebrightening .",
    "figure [ fig : qrpost ] indicates @xmath350.08 for @xmath34 = 0.38 and @xmath360.06 for @xmath34 = 0.34 ( this value was selected as an intermediate radius between objects without rebrightenings and with multiple rebrightenings ) . using the upper limit of the period of stage a superhumps , these values become 0.15 and 0.10 , respectively .",
    "the estimated @xmath2 for @xmath34=0.34 is 0.1305  d and 0.1295  d for the period of stage a superhumps we measured and the upper limit estimated from stage b superhumps , respectively .",
    "we could not detect a periodic signal from observations near quiescence ( 19.9 mag on november 30 and 20.3 mag on december 5 , e - figure 6 ) .    just for completeness",
    ", the @xmath22 value estimated from @xmath37 of stage b superhumps using equation ( 6 ) in @xcite is 0.13(1 ) ( the errors reflects only the error of @xmath37 ) , although it is not certain whether this equation still holds in such a long @xmath2 system .",
    "( 80mm,70mm)fig3.eps      in addition to the relatively small @xmath22 suggested from analysis of superhump periods ( subsection [ sec : qfromsh ] ) , the presence of two rebrightenings is also common to wz sge - type dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "very few systems with long @xmath2 show rebrightenings ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and only two systems v1006 cyg and ogle - gd - dn-014 are known to show two rebrightenings @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 diagram of superhumps is also similar to borderline wz sge / su uma - type systems in two respects : ( 1 ) absence of stage b - c transition before the termination of the superoutburst plateau , ( 2 ) relatively large @xmath37 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "although the absence of early superhumps during the 2016 outburst probably does not favor the wz sge - type classification , it was not completely excluded since there was a 4  d gap before the start of our observation and the phase of early superhumps may have been missed .",
    "further observations during the next occasion are encouraged .      with the estimated @xmath380.130  d , ot j002656",
    "should have a mass of the secondary of 0.20@xmath39 if it is on the standard cv evolutionary track ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which corresponds to @xmath360.25 for an 0.8@xmath39 white dwarf .",
    "our observation suggests an unusually low @xmath22 ( @xmath400.15 ) .",
    "we have three possibilities : ( 1 ) the object is a period bouncer , ( 2 ) the white dwarf is exceptionally massive , ( 3 ) the object evolved through an evolutionary path differently from ordinary cvs . the possibility ( 1 )",
    "appears to be excluded since the object shows outbursts with relatively short intervals ( at least as short as 3  yr ) , which can not be expected for a period bouncer with a very low mass - transfer rate ( cf .",
    "the relatively short evolutionary time of superhumps and large amplitude of superhumps are also signatures disqualifying a period bouncer ( cf .",
    "although an extremely massive white dwarf can not be excluded , well - determined masses of white dwarfs in su uma - type dwarf novae are in a very narrow region @xcite and a very massive white dwarf appears to be rare .    it has been observationally known that some of cvs have undermassive secondaries ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "evolutionary models also suggest that such objects can be formed if mass transfer occurs after the secondary has undergone significant nuclear evolution ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . ot j002656",
    "may be such an object .",
    "future direct observation of the secondary or abundance studies may test this interpretation .",
    "we found the second known ( and with the longest period ) su uma - type dwarf nova above the period gap .",
    "the object , however , turned out to be a rather unusual one , probably not on the standard cv evolutionary track .",
    "it looks likely that the 3:1 resonance is very difficult to achieve above the period gap in dwarf novae on the standard evolutionary track .",
    "the result is consistent with the `` superhump success rate '' in @xcite . upon the present discovery",

    "these observations , however , were not ideally sampled for detecting superhumps and there were only 43 points for the segment jd 24553802455388 .",
