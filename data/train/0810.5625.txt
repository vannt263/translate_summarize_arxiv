    "the vortex - loop theory of the superfluid phase transition provides a very simple and physical picture of the transition@xcite .",
    "an applied superflow acts to orient the thermally excited vortex loops , and their backflow currents screen the net superflow , reducing the superfluid density .",
    "as the temperature is raised towards the lambda point , larger and larger loops can be excited due to screening effects of the smaller loops , and for an infinite system at @xmath6 a loop of infinite size drives the superfluid density to zero .",
    "this is not only the simplest renormalization - group theory of the transition , it also now appears to be the most accurate : two recent simulations @xcite are in agreement with the loop prediction for the superfluid exponent @xmath14 , with the simulations finding @xmath15 .",
    "this simplicity also carries over to the dynamics of the transition , where the characteristic phenomenon of `` critical slowing down '' can also be easily characterized in terms of the vortex - loop dynamics @xcite . at low temperatures only small loops are excited , and with little frictional damping on them they are able to respond to a time - dependent flow field .",
    "as the temperature gets close to the transition , however , the larger loops being excited are subject to much stronger frictional forces , and can no longer keep up with changes in the applied flow , leading to a rapidly diverging superfluid relaxation time . the key parameter in this slowing of the dynamic response",
    "is the loop hausdorff fractal dimension @xmath1 , since the friction is proportional to the total perimeter @xmath2 of a loop , which varies as @xmath3 where _ a _ is the average loop diameter .    for the case of an oscillating applied flow at angular frequency @xmath8 , the frictional force gives rise to a frequency - dependent diffusion length , where loops of diameter considerably smaller than this length can screen the applied flow , while the larger loops can not . at the critical temperature",
    "the largest loops no longer respond to the oscillating flow , giving rise to a non - zero superfluid density at and above @xmath6 .",
    "this is a essentially a finite - size broadening of the transition , with the diffusion length now playing the role of the effective box size .",
    "the finite - frequency dynamics at @xmath6 have also been formulated from dynamic scaling theory by fisher , fisher , and huse @xcite .",
    "we show here that vortex - loop dynamics give precisely the same results , and a dynamic exponent in full agreement with dynamic scaling .",
    "in the loop theory the renormalized finite - frequency superfluid density @xmath16 is given in terms of the zero - frequency density @xmath17 by linear - response theory as @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the core diameter , the smallest loop size , and the response function @xmath20 is found by solving the 3d fokker - planck equation @xcite for vortex rings of diameter @xmath4 , @xmath21 where terms with derivatives of @xmath22 have been neglected . here @xmath23 is to within a constant the vortex - ring diffusion coefficient given by donnelly @xcite for a ring of diameter @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath24 is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the dimensionless renormalized superfluid density , @xmath27 , and flory scaling @xcite gives interaction between vortex segments means that their results are strictly only valid at @xmath11 = 3 . by using the more general interaction @xmath28 the flory minimization gives the vlaue of @xmath29 used here .",
    "the fractal dimension however remains unchanged at @xmath30 .",
    "] @xmath31 in @xmath32 dimensions . at the critical point @xmath33 an asymptotically exact solution of the loop recursion relations",
    "@xcite gives @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fixed - point value of k. since numerical evaluations show that this @xmath36 dependence is already valid at scale lengths of a few @xmath19 , the derivative in eq.1 is essentially a constant except for the smallest loops , and it is easy to see that @xmath24 will then also be nearly constant except for the variation of @xmath37 .",
    "however , at @xmath6 @xmath37 increases rapidly from its initial value @xmath38 at @xmath19 to its fixed point value @xmath35 where it remains constant to the largest loop scales .",
    "hence it is a very good approximation to take @xmath39 to be a constant . in that case",
    "the integral of eq.1 is trivial , yielding for the frequency dependence of the superfluid density @xmath40 from further development of eq.1 it was shown in ref.@xcite that the superfluid relaxation time varies as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the correlation length . from the definition of the dynamic exponent @xmath9 ,",
    "the loop prediction is then @xmath43 .",
    "eq.4 is then @xmath44 which is the main result of this paper , since it is exactly the @xmath32 scaling prediction of fisher , fisher , and huse @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part , the dissipation , also has a universal dependence , which we express in terms of the phase angle @xmath45 which is also the same as in ref.@xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath9 can be found from the flory - scaling result @xcite for the fractal dimension , @xmath12 , giving then @xmath46 , showing that the loop dynamics is in complete agreement with dynamic scaling @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of the xy model have now verified this value of @xmath9 to high accuracy @xcite , finding z = 1.500(9 ) .    to check the approximations made in evaluating eqs.1 and 2 above",
    ", we have numerically integrated these equations , shown in figs.1 and 2 . only at very low frequencies",
    "is there a very slight difference from eqs.6 and 7 , since at low frequencies a wider range of loop sizes is involved before @xmath22 becomes small .",
    "full solution for the phase angle ( solid line ) , compared with @xmath47 from eq.7 ]    full solution for the phase angle ( solid line ) , compared with @xmath47 from eq.7 ]",
    "the agreement with dynamic scaling provides evidence that the flory scaling result for the loop fractal dimension @xmath48 is quite accurate .",
    "previous estimates @xcite of the fractal dimension from xy model simulations have found considerably lower values , however , of 2.287(4 ) and 2.1693(4 ) .",
    "these authors do not discuss the discrepancy between the two values , which is much greater than the claimed errors .",
    "the fractal dimension is extracted from the computed size distribution of the loops , a procedure which has been noted to be problematic by olsson @xcite .",
    "the problem is that on a lattice two loops that approach each other closer than a lattice spacing ( which occurs with some frequency since the density is high near the transition temperature ) can not be resolved , so that there could either be two small loops or one large loop .",
    "a 50 - 50 guess is made in such a case , with the hope that the effect on the size distribution will average to zero .",
    "the simulations by olsson gave evidence that this may not be the case , that the guess does lead to a distortion of the distribution .",
    "we note that a current simulation in progress not subject to this problem ( the `` worm '' algorithm ) is apparently now finding a value for the fractal dimension that is within a few percent of the flory value of 2.5 ( n. prokofev , private communication ) .",
