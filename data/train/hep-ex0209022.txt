    "the re - analysis of @xmath6  annihilation data collected with the jade detector at the petra collider ( 1978 - 1986 ) has been shown to be a valuable effort @xcite since the characteristic energy evolution of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) becomes more manifest towards decreasing centre - of - mass energies @xmath7 .",
    "recently , data at energies down to @xmath1gev could be employed in state - of - the - art qcd studies due to the successful resurrection of the original jade software .    since the petra shutdown , significant progress has been made in the theoretical calculations of event shape observables . in the following , we present an @xmath0  analysis at @xmath1-@xmath2gev based on the most complete perturbative calculations for event shapes  @xcite available so far .",
    "we included recently analysed data in the energy region @xmath1-@xmath8gev for which the calculations are applied for the first time .",
    "furthermore , power corrections based on an analytical model by dokshitzer , marchesini , and webber  @xcite ( dmw ) were investigated as a promising approach to describe non - perturbative effects in event shapes .",
    "besides @xmath0 , the model depends only on one additional free parameter .",
    "also the consistency of power corrections with the gauge structure of qcd was tested .",
    "from multihadronic data samples , the distributions of _ thrust _ ( ) , _ heavy jet mass _ ( @xmath9 ) , _ total _ and _ wide jet broadening _ ( @xmath10  and @xmath11 ) , _",

    "differential 2-jet rate _",
    "@xmath13  in the durham scheme are calculated ( cf .",
    "the data are corrected for the limited acceptance and resolution of the detector and for initial state photon radiation . since electroweak decays of the heavy b - hadrons fake hard gluon radiation particularly at @xmath14 22gev",
    ", we take the contribution @xmath15 as an additional background to be subtracted from the distributions .",
    "the data have been used to assess the performance of various qcd event generators tuned to lep data at @xmath16 ( cf .",
    "the parton shower and string fragmentation model implemented in pythia / jetsetis found to be well capable of describing event shapes down to @xmath17gev .",
    "the quality of the models ariadne  ( colour dipole scheme ) and herwig  ( cluster fragmentation ) , however , is more moderate , and cojets(independent fragmentation ) is clearly disfavoured .",
    "obviously , the model parameters of these generators need a re - tune at lower @xmath7 .",
    "the determination of @xmath0  is based on a combination of an exact qcd matrix element calculation @xmath18  @xcite intended to describe the 3-jet region of phase space and a next - to - leading - logarithmic approximation ( nlla ) @xcite valid in the 2-jet region where multiple radiation of soft and collinear gluons from a system of two hard back - to - back partons dominate .",
    "we perform @xmath19-fits of the theoretical predictions corrected for hadronisation effects . for the main results , we use the @xmath20-scheme  @xcite for the perturbative prediction with the renormalisation scale factor @xmath21  @xmath22  =  1 and pythia  for the estimation of non - perturbative contributions .",
    "we generally observe stable fits and good agreement with the data at each @xmath7  with @xmath23 0.2 - 2.0 . in case of @xmath11 ,",
    "a significant excess of the theory over the data in the 3-jet region of the distributions is present .",
    "experimental errors are under control for all data samples .",
    "expectedly , hadronisation uncertainties increase rapidly towards 14gev .",
    "the individual results agree with each other within 1 - 2 standard deviations of the fit and experimental errors . for each @xmath7 ,",
    "the @xmath0  values from the six observables are combined using the weighted mean method of ref.@xcite ( tab .  [",
    "tab : as ] ) .",
    "the total errors are dominated by higher order uncertainties . at 14 and 22gev ,",
    "hadronisation uncertainties are of the same order as the qcd scale ambiguities .",
    ".[tab : as ] preliminary @xmath0  results from jade . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the @xmath0  results obtained here and in similar analyses at higher energies based on resummed event shapes ( fig .  [",
    "fig : as ] ) agree well with the qcd expectation for the running coupling  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath19-fit taking statistical and experimental errors into account yields @xmath24 with @xmath25 . even considering the total errors , the unphysical hypothesis @xmath26 const .",
    "is disfavoured by a fit probability of @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28  derived using @xmath18+nlla predictions for event shapes in @xmath6  annihilation . ]",
    "the dmw model  @xcite describes non - perturbative effects to event shapes as contributions from gluon radiation at low energy scales , assuming that the physical strong coupling @xmath29  remains finite in the energy region around the landau pole where simple perturbative evolution of @xmath0  breaks down .",
    "this leads to the introduction of a parameter @xmath30 that absorbs all non - perturbative details of @xmath29  up to an arbitrary infrared matching scale @xmath31 .",
    "the principle structure of power corrections is a shift @xmath32 of the perturbative spectrum away from the 2-jet region , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 depending on @xmath35 . in case of @xmath10  and @xmath11 ,",
    "the shift is superimposed by a squeeze @xmath36 . for mean values",
    "one obtains also an additive correction .",
    "the perturbative part is @xmath18+nlla for the distributions and @xmath18  for the means .",
    "the prediction , in particular the universality of @xmath37 , has been tested by global fits to the hadron level data from this analysis and from other experiments e.g. at lep / slc up to @xmath38 189gev ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , with @xmath39  and @xmath40  as only free parameters .",
    "the major features of the distributions are reproduced well , thus supporting the @xmath41 evolution of power corrections in event shapes .",
    "however , we observe discrepancies for the distributions of the less inclusive quantities @xmath9  and @xmath11  in particular at @xmath42 .    for @xmath13  the leading power correction is known to be quadratic in @xmath41 .",
    "this expectation has been verified by means of the new jade distributions at @xmath1 and 22gev using a simple additive power correction ansatz .",

    "[ fig : pc ] , there is a reasonable agreement between the individual results within the total uncertainties .",
    "however , the @xmath4  results from the @xmath9  and @xmath11   distributions are large compared to the results from the other observables .",
    "this observation may be related to the non - inclusiveness of these variables .",
    "the @xmath0  values from power corrections to the distributions are systematically smaller than the results based on mc corrections .",
    "this is due to the different amounts of squeeze of the perturbative spectrum predicted by both types of model , particularly in case of @xmath11 .    combining the results for the mean values and the distributions taking correlations between the systematic errors into account yields @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the scatter of the @xmath4  values is mostly covered by the theoretical uncertainty of the milan factor  @xcite .",
    "the dmw ansatz has been exploited to extract the qcd colour factors @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "various global fits to the event shape spectra trying alternative sets of the free model parameters support the @xmath48 symmetry group .",
    "the most stable and precise measurements are provided by @xmath49  and @xmath12 . combining the corresponding results for these variables with @xmath40  and",
    "@xmath50  fixed , and @xmath39 , @xmath46 , and @xmath45 free , one finds @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the qcd expectation while some other gauge symmetry groups are excluded .",
    "resummed qcd theory combined with lep tuned hadronisation models fits event shape data well down to @xmath1gev and allow consistent determinations of @xmath0 .",
    "the combined result evolved to the @xmath53 mass scale is @xmath3 which is substantially more precise than former petra measurements and also in good agreement with the world average value @xcite .",
    "power corrections @xmath54 generally reproduce the overall event shape spectra , except for the distributions of the less inclusive variables ( @xmath9  and @xmath11 ) at @xmath42 . the results for @xmath4  support the dmw prediction of universality within 25% .",
    "using power corrections , the gauge structure of qcd has been verified with uncertainties competitive e.g. with traditional 4-jet angular correlation analyses .",
    "potential biases from hadronisation models are reduced within this approach ."
