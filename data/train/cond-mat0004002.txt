    "elastomers and gels are intrinsically disordered solids that retain the memory of their initial states .",
    "the non - equilibrium nature of their fabrication processes causes frozen heterogeneities in the network structure , which range in size from mesoscopic to macroscopic scales  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the quenched disorder comes to the fore when we introduce some soft order in the system .",
    "for instance , density fluctuations of swollen gels near the critical point are strongly enhanced by the heterogeneities . under stretching ,",
    "they produce the so - called `` abnormal butterfly '' pattern in small - angle neutron scattering intensity  @xcite .",
    "it illustrates how the elasticity of gels gives rise to a non - trivial effect unexpected in other random systems .",
    "here we address another example of soft order in disordered elastic networks .",
    "nematic liquid - crystalline elastomers and gels constitute a unique class of solids characterized by a coupling between the orientational and translational degrees of freedom .",
    "physical consequences of the strain - orientation coupling have been the subject of a considerable amount of studies , both theoretical and experimental .",
    "notable theoretical advances in the past include : ( i ) de gennes  @xcite showed that a spontaneous elongation along the director is induced by the isotropic - nematic ( i - n ) transition ; ( ii ) a molecular model of nematic networks was constructed by warner et al .",
    "@xcite , extending the classical affine - deformation model of rubber elasticity ; ( iii ) uniformly oriented networks possess soft modes of strain and orientation fluctuations that do not accompany any change of rubber - elastic free energy .",
    "it was first predicted by golubovi and lubensky  @xcite on a phenomenological ground and later extended by the affine - deformation theory  @xcite . thus and in other ways , the behavior of homogeneous and clean nematic networks is now fairly well understood  @xcite .    in practice , however , nematic networks in equilibrium quite often exhibit polydomain director textures , where the orientational correlation length is typically in the micron range . under external strain ,",
    "polydomain networks undergo a structural change into a macroscopically aligned monodomain state , where the director lies along the extensional direction .",
    "this change , called the polydomain - monodomain ( p - m ) transition , is characterized by a highly non - linear mechanical response  @xcite .",
    "the strain - stress curve shows a small slope in the partially aligned ( polydomain ) state .",
    "depending on the material and the method of synthesis , the slope is sometimes vanishingly small while it is sizable in other cases .",
    "the macroscopic stress as a function of strain shows a steep rise as the system turns into the monodomain state .",
    "there have been a few theoretical attempts to describe polydomain networks and their mechanical responses .",
    "ten bosch and varichon  @xcite set up the first model , in which they attributed the origin of the equilibrium texture to a random anchoring field exerted by network crosslinks .",
    "an interesting analogy with random anisotropy magnets  @xcite was pursued by fridrikh and terentjev  @xcite .",
    "they proposed a mapping to the xy model under random and homogeneous magnetic fields , from analysis of which they predicted a discontinuous stress - orientation curve .    nonetheless , the role of strain - orientation coupling in polydomain networks is still far from clear .",
    "there are two aspects to be considered .",
    "firstly , the previous theories assume only local interactions between domains , for instance by arguing that the elastic free energy localizes in domain walls under strain  @xcite . in general , however , inhomogeneities in an elastic material cause non - local or long - range interactions mediated by the strain field . such elastic interactions",
    "control the physics of various systems , such as solids with dislocations  @xcite or surface defects  @xcite , phase separating alloys  @xcite , gels undergoing swelling  @xcite , and membranes with inclusions  @xcite .",
    "disordered nematic networks provide another intriguing example , and differ from any of the above materials in having a non - scalar order parameter .",
    "secondly , the mechanical response should strongly depend on the crosslinking condition .",
    "polydomain elastomers have been obtained by either of the following ways  @xcite ; ( i ) to crosslink a polymer melt in the isotropic phase and then cool it into the nematic phase ; ( ii ) to crosslink a nematic polymer melt containing polydomain textures .",
    "these two cases have not been theoretically well distinguished so far",
    ". we shall refer to them as the cases of isotropic and anisotropic crosslinkings , respectively .",
    "recently , we studied the elastic interaction in isotropically crosslinked networks  @xcite , and found an almost completely soft p - m transition  @xcite . the macroscopic stress due to the strain - orientation coupling was shown to be slightly negative and of @xmath0 in the p - m transition regime , where @xmath1 is the degree of chain anisotropy .",
    "this contrasts with the earlier prediction of a positive stress of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the elastic interaction also produces a `` four - leaf clover '' pattern in the depolarized light scattering intensity , which resembles the experimental observation by clarke et al .",
    "@xcite .    in this article",
    ", we extend previous work  @xcite and provide the details of our picture of the p - m transition . here",
    "let us summarize the ideas and results which we have not emphasized in previous work .",
    "firstly , we pursue the idea that random internal stresses destroy the long - range orientational order , which was suggested ( but not proven ) earlier in a broader context  @xcite .",
    "this will be done by incorporating the notion of frozen heterogeneous strains into the extended affine - deformation theory  @xcite .",
    "we argue that the random internal stresses act as stronger sources of disorder than the random molecular field due to crosslinks  @xcite .",
    "secondly , evolution of domain structure with and without external stretching is numerically simulated by a simplified dynamical model . the `` four - leaf clover ''",
    "scattering pattern has four peaks at finite wavenumbers , and the peak height is a non - monotonic function of the macroscopic strain , in qualitative agreement with experiment .",
    "we find a slow dynamical relaxation of the structure factor , and show that the peak wavenumber asymptotically goes to zero in the long - time limit .",
    "thirdly , we study the case of anisotropic crosslinking . in this case",
    ", the initial director configuration of a macroscopic polydomain texture is memorized into the network .",
    "it provides a source of strong and correlated disorder , resulting in a non - soft p - m transition .",
    "the spatial distribution of elastic free energy in anisotropically crosslinked networks is strongly dehomogenized by strain , while that in isotropically crosslinked networks is unchanged during the p - m transition .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce a random stress model , derive an effective free energy , and discuss the mechanism of the soft mechanical response .",
    "section iii describes a numerical simulation of the polydomain state and the p - m transition . in section iv",
    ", we analyze the effect of random stresses on director fluctuations in the monodomain state .",
    "we study networks prepared in the nematic phase in section v. in section vi , we summarize the results in comparison to existing experiments , and conclude with a proposal of future directions .",
    "it is known since long ago  @xcite that the network structure of gels are often heterogeneous on many length - scales , which are considerably larger than the mesh size ( see ) . in the swollen state , these imperfections manifest themselves as density inhomogeneity and are observed through the so - called butterfly pattern in neutron scattering intensity or as speckles in light scattering experiment  @xcite . although less discussed in the literature , it is natural to expect that elastomers , often fabricated by drying gels , also contain the memory of heterogeneous network formation .",
    "the frozen heterogeneities reflect the non - equilibrium nature of the crosslinking processes , and produce random internal stresses in the material .",
    "while the roles of random stresses in gels and other amorphous solids have been discussed from a phenomenological point of view  @xcite , much remains to be done to understand them on the basis of a molecular theory  @xcite . in this subsection ,",
    "we recapitulate the notion of random stresses using the classical affine - deformation theory of isotropic rubber networks  @xcite , in order to prepare for modeling disordered nematic networks in the next subsection .",
    "the basic object in the affine - deformation theory is the probability distribution of the chain s end - to - end vector @xmath3 .",
    "the distribution function at thermal equilibrium is isotropic and gaussian , and given by p_eq ( ) = n^-1 , [ peq ] where @xmath4 @xmath5 is a constant , @xmath6 is the spatial dimension , and @xmath7 is the normalization factor .",

    "the free energy per chain is given by  @xcite f_chain = - k_bt d p_0 ( ) p_eq ( ) , [ fchain ] where @xmath11 is the probability distribution function at the moment of crosslinking , which is not necessarily identical to the equilibrium distribution .",
    "we assume that the chains are distorted before crosslinking , and denote the deviation from the equilibrium conformation by a tensor @xmath12 , defined by _ 0 = ( + ) , [ defr ] where @xmath13 is the unit tensor . if the deviation is not very large and the chains are not stretched out , we may still approximate @xmath14 to be gaussian , and put p_0 ( ) = n_0 ^ -1 .",

    "inhomogeneous contribution of the form @xmath18 can be also derived from cauchy s theory of solids bound by a central force  @xcite .",
    "we shall call @xmath19 the quenched random stress  @xcite , although it is more directly related to quenched random _",
    "strain _ in the present model . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that the frozen heterogeneities have a single characteristic size @xmath20 , which is substantially larger than the mesh size .",

    "their basic observation is that nematic chains with low backbone rigidity are well characterized by an anisotropic gaussian conformation , elongated along the director .",
    "the equilibrium distribution of the end - to - end vector can be written in the form , p_eq ( ) & = & n^-1 , [ pnematic ] where @xmath1 is the degree of chain anisotropy and q_ij = q_0 is the orientational order parameter with @xmath23 being the director .",

    "firstly , means that the velocity @xmath167 is proportional to the force @xmath168 .",
    "this applies to motion of a network in a viscous solvent  @xcite , where we have a straightforward analogy to darcy s law in porous media . on the other hand , in dry elastomers",

    "this does not matter if the dynamics of the orientational order parameter is fast and slaved to that of the displacement field , which we expect to be the case .",

    "the above results show that the relaxation process can be decomposed into three characteristic stages : ( i ) the quench into the nematic phase from the isotropic phase produces microscopic textures , which coarsen to reduce both the rubber - elastic and frank free energies .",
    "after the characteristic domain size reaches @xmath77 , anisotropic domain reconfiguration on this scale follows .",

    "( iii ) the domain size converges to a finite equilibrium value , while the anisotropic domain reconfiguration proceeds on larger scales ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "recall that , if there is no quenched disorder , the ground state of the system is the macroscopically elongated state with @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in this state",
    ", there are so - called soft modes of director fluctuation , which do not accompany any change in the rubber elastic free energy  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the soft modes implies that a homogeneous director configuration becomes unstable for @xmath161 ; when we compress the gel along the optical axis , the director `` buckles '' to partially cancel the rise of elastic free energy by compression .",
    "the result of the previous section means that this instability is almost completely soft even for large deformations . in this section , we look at the monodomain region @xmath195 and analyze the director fluctuation modes in a harmonic level",

    "@xcite that the soft fluctuations at the critical point @xmath46 is strongly enhanced by quenched disorder and satisfy @xmath196 .",

    "also , the model used in  @xcite remains largely phenomenological , and a quantitative assessment of the prediction is necessary .",
    "here we extend the analysis to arbitrary values of @xmath40 , and discuss the possibility to find disorder - enhanced fluctuations in practical situations .",
    "the director is decomposed into a homogeneous part and a small deviation , as ( ) = _ x + ( ) .",

    "the director texture is almost same as that just before crosslinking , or @xmath266 .",
    "this is reflected in the extremely homogeneous free energy distribution .",
    "external strain strongly dehomogenize the distribution , and the peak is continuously broadened as we increase @xmath40 toward the monodomain region .",
    "we have studied polydomain nematic networks from two aspects , namely , ( i ) breaking of long - range orientational order by frozen internal stresses and ( ii ) a non - local inter - domain interaction arising from strain - orientation coupling .",
    "the mechanical response is controlled by the latter if the quenched disorder is of moderate strength ( or , if @xmath267 ) . in this case , the proper elastic interaction reorganizes the polydomain structure so that local elongation along the director is achieved everywhere in the system .",
    "the resulting structure contains the checkered correlation pattern on various scales , which produces the `` four - leaf clover '' pattern in the depolarized scattering intensity . upon stretching ,",

    "we may say that there are mechanical _ quasi - goldstone modes _ , which are distinguished from the genuine goldstone modes of fluid nematic liquid crystals in that there is an anisotropic correlation even in the absence of external field and that the quenched disorder selects a characteristic lengthscale .",
    "we have discussed two sources of quenched disorder .",
    "one is the random stress due to residual heterogeneous strains at the moment of crosslinking , considered ubiquitous in rubbery networks .",
    "the anisotropic ( shear ) part of random stresses act on the orientational order , both locally and non - locally .",
    "the macroscopic domain size observed in experiments can be explained if there are frozen heterogeneities of a reasonably small magnitude ( e.g. @xmath268 percent in strain ) and a size somewhat larger than that of individual network meshes ( e.g. @xmath269 nm ) .",
    "a different viewpoint is taken in previous theories  @xcite , where a random molecular field operating at crosslinks is assumed to be the source of disorder .",
    "the random field hypothesized there has a small correlation length roughly equal to the distance @xmath44 between crosslinks .",
    "the ratio @xmath270 is a large number ( @xmath271 ) , which means a weak effective disorder .",
    "currently we know of no firm experimental indication of the disorder strength .",
    "a possible method of its estimate is to observe director fluctuation in the monodomain state .",
    "we have calculated thermal and disorder contributions to the fluctuation amplitude , which is proportional to the polarized light scattering intensity .",
    "the intensity diminishes as we stretch the network , and there is a region of macroscopic strain @xmath40 where the disorder contribution dominates over the thermal one . the width of the region and the absolute value of the intensity should inform us the order of the disorder strength .",
    "the thermal and quenched contributions could be separately analyzed by use of dynamical light scattering ( dls ) .",
    "indeed , dls has been successfully used to decompose the two kinds of density fluctuation in gels  @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that a similar method will be developed for orientation fluctuation in the present system .    by crosslinking the network in the nematic phase and",
    "in the course of phase ordering , we obtain another kind of quenched stresses .",
    "the polydomain texture of the liquid - crystalline polymer melt is almost completely frozen by crosslinking , if its characteristic size is larger than @xmath77 .",
    "the memory of the initial macroscopic texture makes the mechanical response non - soft .",
    "spatial distribution of the elastic free energy is strongly dehomogenized by applied strain , in contrast to the case of isotropic crosslinking .",
    "the influence of crosslinking conditions has little been discussed in previous studies of the p - m transition , except for a few experimental papers  @xcite .",
    "kpfer and finkelmann  @xcite studied both isotropic and anisotropic crosslinkings under external stress of various magnitudes .",
    "fig.8 in the reference shows that polydomain networks crosslinked in the nematic phase are harder than those prepared in the isotropic phase .",
    "another example of soft and non - soft p - m transitions is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is stated that some of their samples were prepared above the isotropic - nematic transition temperature of the melt , while the others are crosslinked below it .",
    "unfortunately , they do not explicitly state the crosslinking condition for each stress - strain curve .",
    "we wish further effort in this direction to be made in the future , especially to find more evidence of vanishing macroscopic stress .    a remark should be made in relation to this .",
    "we have assumed that the quenched heterogeneities have mesoscopic sizes in the case of isotropic crosslinking .",
    "however , if the network is crosslinked in poor solvents or near the spinodal line , the heterogeneities can be macroscopic and cause strong effective disorder .",
    "therefore , the mechanical response should be discussed in terms of the size of the heterogeneity , not only on the phase where the gel is fabricated .",
    "another problem in interpretation of strain - stress data arises from slowness of dynamical relaxation .",
    "a recent dynamic measurement by clarke and terentjev  @xcite strongly suggests that the stress level will be substantially lowered in the final equilibrium state , which is not reachable on a practical timescale .",
    "it might be possible that a soft equilibrium p - m transition is masked behind a stress plateau of a sizable height , which is reported in earlier studies  @xcite .",
    "we have studied dynamical relaxation after a quench from the isotropic phase .",
    "the structure factor develops a peak at a finite wavenumber , which goes to zero as the true equilibrium is approached .",
    "both the inverse peak wavenumber and the correlation length show a power - law type growth in an intermediate stage , while the elastic free energy is almost completely minimized in an early regime of the coarsening process .",
    "some of the experimentally observed features of the `` four - leaf clover '' scattering pattern have been reproduced in the present work .",
    "firstly , we propose that the finiteness of the observed peak wavenumber is explained by the slow relaxation .",
    "the experimental peak wavenumber does not change during the p - m transition  @xcite . together with our simulation result",
    ", it suggests that the coarsening is very slow and does not occur in the timescale of observation .",
    "further experimental study of structural relaxation in conjunction with stress relaxation would be informative to check this point .",
    "secondly , the peak intensity increases and then decreases as we stretch the gel . qualitatively the same monotonic behavior is reported in the experiment .",
    "the initial increase is due to a sharpening the peak , which is partially understood by the fact that the director fluctuation at @xmath46 is soft only on a plane and a line in the @xmath128-space .",
    "we close by listing some open questions .",
    "( i ) we did not answer whether the long - range order is destroyed by an _ arbitrarily _ weak disorder under _ no external stress _ or , equivalently , when the average strain @xmath40 is not externally constrained .",
    "a shift of the ground state from the monodomain ( @xmath46 ) to polydomain ( @xmath48 ) states should occur , either gradually or abruptly , as we increase the disorder strength from zero .",
    "probably this problem is not of practical importance because of a small but finite hysteresis and the slow dynamics .",
    "( ii ) stretching - induced - anisotropy of the depolarized scattering pattern as we numerically find is contrary to the experimental observation .",
    "we may suggest an effect of spatial dimensionality . in three dimensions",
    "there are three frank constants , whose relative strengths may affect the anisotropy .",
    "experimental investigation of 3d domain structure would be informative .",
    "( iii ) much remains to be done for understanding dynamical relaxation to the final equilibrium state . in theoretical part",
    ", the origin of the apparent power law is yet unknown .",
    "dynamic equations for dry elastomers are to be constructed , taking the intra - network friction account . in numerical part ,",
    "late stages of the relaxation process is left unexplored .",
