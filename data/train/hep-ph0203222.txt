    "the data from the various neutrino experiments indicate a bimaximal mixing among three neutrino generations . the atmospheric neutrino puzzle requires a near maximal mixing between a pair of neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the solar neutrino puzzle has various possible solutions but the large angle msw solution is favoured @xcite . as the mass squared difference required for these two solutions",
    "differ by about few orders of magnitude , we must have two different pairs with large mixing .",
    "the chooz experiment constrain one of the mixing angles to be small @xcite .",
    "so out of three mixing angles two are large and one is small indicating a bimaximal structure .",
    "the large mixing in neutrino is in sharp contrast to the very small mixing in the quark sector .",
    "flavor symmetries may generate bimaximal mixing structure in neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "but such structure generated at the high scale may not be stable under renormalisation group evolution to low scale if neutrino masses are quasi degenerate @xcite .",
    "alternatively renormalisation group evolution from high scale to the present scale have been proposed as a mechanism to generate large mixing from a small mixing @xcite .",
    "but in these mechanism enhancement of the mixing angle is scale dependent and hence may be unstable and fine tuned .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we do a three generation analysis and find that large mixing can be a stable fixed point of renormalisation group evolution in certain region of experimentally allowed parameter space .",
    "we consider a quasi degenerate mass structure with one of the state in an opposite cp phase to the other two .",
    "existence of large mixing angle as a stable fixed point of renormalisation group evolution has the advantage that once the mixing attains the stable large value , it does nt change much under renormalisation group evolution and hence there is no fine tuning .",
    "so one does nt have to explicitly evolve the mixing matrix under renormalisation group .",
    "the fixed point value of the mixing can be obtained after a small perturbation on the neutrino mass matrix at the high scale due to radiative correction .",
    "one may take the view that unlike the quark and charged lepton mixing , all the three neutrino mixing angle can be large at the high scale .",
    "this is because quark and charged lepton masses show a hierarchical structure while neutrinos may not . in this case",
    "we investigate whether one of the mixing angle attain small value as fixed point due to radiative correction while the other two remain unchanged .",
    "if so then this mechanism can also produce the required bimaximal mixing pattern . in the next section we present the analysis to generate large stable mixing due to perturbation from radiative correction . in section 3",
    "we investigate whether a stable small mixing can be obtained from all large mixing at high scale . in section 4",
    "we present the conclusion .",

    "the other two mixing angles are small .",
    "let us parametrise the mixing matrix @xmath0 as follows u ( , , ) = r_23()r_13()r_12 ( ) [ mix ] the mixing matrix can contain two physical majorana phases .",
    "we ignore these phases in our calculations .",
    "a detailed analysis including these phases and different types of hierarchy amongst the masses have been done by haba _ et .",
    "@xcite in mssm .",
    "the interesting cases of the stability of maximal and zero mixing occurs when the difference of these physical phases is 0 or @xmath1 and all the masses are degenerate .",
    "we do a model independent analysis through a perturbation of the mass matrix at the high scale and investigate whether a bimaximal mixing can be a fixed point of the evolution of the mass matrix under radiative correction .",
    "let the ( 2,3 ) states be the pseudo dirac pair in @xmath2 .",
    "so @xmath3 is maximal and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are small . in this parametrisation and the mass spectrum eq.([md1 ] ) , the mass matrix in the flavor basis will be m&=&um_du^ + & = & m ( c_2&-s_2s _ & -s_2 c _",

    "so @xmath5 can be arbitrary at the high scale .    the first part of @xmath10 in ( [ mmz ] ) @xmath12 is diagonalised by the same mixing matrix @xmath13 .",
    "the three eigenvalues are just @xmath14 times the eigenvalues of @xmath11 .",
    "so the degeneracy is not lifted in this part .",
    "treating the second term @xmath15 as a perturbation over @xmath16 we get the following split in the degenerate mass eigenvalues m_1,2=(m_22)_e [ ev2 ] the corresponding mass eigenvectors in this sector are given by a rotation in the ( 1,2 ) sector @xmath17 where @xmath18 is given by",
    " = m_12m_22 + [ omg ] the changes in the state 3 is small and from the parametrisation of the mixing matrix in eq.([mix ] ) we see that the angles @xmath3 and @xmath4 do not change much .",
    "so the mixing after the perturbation is given by u(,, ) = r_23()r_13()r_12( ) [ mix ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "eq.([omg ] ) says that @xmath18 is independent of radiative corrections ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) at a given scale .",
    "so @xmath18 achieves the stable value independent of renormalisation group evolution .",
    "the stable value of @xmath18 depends on the high scale values of @xmath4 and @xmath3 . from eq.([omg ] ) we see that when @xmath23 @xmath18 is near maximal .",
    "this happens for small @xmath4 and near maximal @xmath3 . in figure [ omgpsi ]",
    "we plot @xmath18 verses @xmath3 for various values of @xmath4 .",
    "the interesting point is that large @xmath18 is obtained for small values of @xmath4 and very near maximal value of @xmath3 .",
    "this is the region of interest suggested by the chooz constraint and the atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "if the high scale mass matrix is generated by a seesaw mechanism that produces degenerate neutrino masses with a pseudo dirac pair , it is natural to have @xmath4 and @xmath5 small at the high scale while @xmath3 is maximal @xcite . then due to quantum correction @xmath5 stabilises to a large value by radiative correction .",
    "this mechanism is model independent .",
    "it will work in any theory where the radiative corrections can be expressed as in eq.([rad ] ) .",
    "the drawback of this mechanism is that the angle @xmath3 is constrained to be in a very small window around @xmath24 for small values of @xmath4 if we want large @xmath18 .",
    "for example if we demand @xmath5 to be above @xmath25 then @xmath3 has to be between @xmath26 and @xmath24 for @xmath27 .",
    "for @xmath28 the region of @xmath29 is constrained to be between @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath3 lies below @xmath31 this mechanism can not explain the large angle solar neutrino solution .",
    "however it may be possible that @xmath3 may be almost exactly maximal as suggested by the current atmospheric neutrino data . to make a simple estimate about how much @xmath3 can deviate from maximal mixing due to radiative correction",
    ", we evaluate the small perturbative change in the third eigenstate with @xmath32 .",
    "as we are interested in small @xmath4 region we put @xmath33 .",
    "so after radiative correction the third mass state with eigenvalue @xmath34 is |3= ( 0 + s",
    "_ + c _ ) + s_2c_^2s_(_e+_e)2 ( 0 + c",
    "_ + -s _ ) this shows that the change in the state @xmath35 indicates a change in the angle @xmath3 by @xmath36 in radians , i.e @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath38 then the change in the angle @xmath3 is less than @xmath39 around maximal @xmath3 .",
    "so the angle @xmath3 seems to be stable enough to stay near maximal within few degrees .",
    "in the above section we considered generation of a large mixing from a small mixing at the high scale .",
    "however we may have the view that having large mixing between the mass states can be as natural as having small mixing .",
    "then radiative correction may produce a small mixing between a pair with same cp parity while not affecting the other two large mixing .",
    "then this can be an alternative mechanism to generate a stable bimaximal mixing pattern .",
    "here we see if this can be done .",

    "this parametrisation is useful here as we wish to find the stable value of the ( 1,3 ) mixing angle @xmath4 after radiative correction as the these two states have the same cp parity .",
    "as long as @xmath4 is small this parametrisation will have nearly the same prediction for the mixing angles @xmath5 and @xmath3 as with the standard parametrisation in eq.([mix ] ) .",
    "this is because for small values of @xmath4 , @xmath40 is very nearly identity and hence it commutes with all other matrices . hence its position does nt change the predictions as long as the relative order of the large mixing matrices @xmath41 and @xmath42 are not changed .",
    "the mass matrix in the flavor basis is m&=&um_du^ + & = & m ( c_2&-s_2c _ & s_2 s _",

    "@xmath4 is     = m_13 m_33 + [ tanphi ]    we see from eq.([mflavor ] ) that @xmath43 is not small unless @xmath5 and @xmath3 both are small . in fig[phipsi ] we show a plot of the fixed point value of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath3 for various values of @xmath5 . for large values of @xmath44",
    "we see that @xmath4 is not small near large or maximal @xmath3 .",
    "so we can not produce a bimaximal mixing in this way .",
    "bimaximal mixing pattern can be obtained from small mixing at high scale .",
    "we present an analysis based on finding stable fixed point of mixing angle after small perturbation to the mass matrix due to radiative correction .",
    "this has the advantage that the large stable mixing can be evaluated without requiring to evolve the mixing from high scale down to the present scale .",
    "this is possible because the mixing does nt change with scale further down after attaining the fixed point value .",
    "the large mixing being a fixed point this solution is not fine tuned as is the case with some of the earlier analysis .",
    "we present a variant of the mechanism to see whether one small mixing can be obtained from all large mixing at high scale by radiative correction .",
    "we find that this is not possible in the region of interest indicated by experiments .",
