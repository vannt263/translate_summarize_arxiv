    "well before the advent of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of the strong force , it was realized that the essential ingredients of the hadronic world at low energies are chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking .",
    "( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) . mainly through lattice qcd simulations",
    ", it has become well established that chiral symmetry breaking by the vacuum state of qcd is a nonperturbative phenomenon that results from the interaction of many microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "we argue in this review that the complexity of the qcd vacuum leads to a low - energy description that is completely dictated by the global symmetries of qcd .",
    "this interpretation of goldstone s theorem provides a natural duality between a strongly interacting fundamental theory and a weakly interacting low - energy effective theory .",
    "we illustrate the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking using the simpler example of a classical spin system with two rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system has a certain symmetry : it is invariant under rotations . in mathematical language",
    ", the symmetry group is @xmath0 .",
    "however , at low temperatures , the ground state of the system does not exhibit this symmetry . in a small external magnetic field , which breaks the rotational invariance explicitly",
    ", the spins will polarize in the direction of the magnetic field . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the spins remain polarized even if the magnetic field is switched off completely .",
    "this phenomenon is known as spontaneous magnetization .",
    "the ground state is no longer invariant under o(3 ) rotations but only under o(2 ) rotations in the plane perpendicular to the spontaneous magnetization . in mathematical language , the full symmetry group @xmath0 is spontaneously broken to a smaller symmetry group @xmath1 . the spontaneously broken phase is characterized by low - energy excitations in the form of spin waves in the plane perpendicular to the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "this is a consequence of a general theorem known as goldstone s theorem @xcite , which tells us that spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry leads to low - lying excitations , the goldstone modes , with a mass that vanishes in the absence of a symmetry - breaking field .",
    "the goldstone modes are given by the fluctuations in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "thus , the spin system has two goldstone modes . in general",
    ", spontaneous symmetry breaking in a system of spins with @xmath2 components is associated with @xmath3 goldstone modes .",
    "this number is also equal to the number of generators of the coset @xmath4 [ the number of generators of o(@xmath2 ) is @xmath5 .",
    "a spontaneously broken symmetry is characterized by an order parameter , which in this case is the spontaneous magnetization . at nonzero temperature , the alignment of the spins is counteracted by their thermal motion , and above a critical temperature ( the curie temperature ) the spontaneous magnetization vanishes .",
    "let us now consider the hadronic world and interpret the particle spectrum in terms of the concepts discussed above .",
    "we will look for the simplest theory consistent with the following two empirical facts : @xmath6 there are three bosonic particles , the pions , that are much lighter than all other hadrons and @xmath7 the proton and the neutron have almost the same mass .",
    "fact @xmath6 implies that there are three goldstone bosons associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "assume that the underlying theory is based on an @xmath2-component field without preferred directions , i.e.  the theory is invariant under o(@xmath2 ) transformations of the fields .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking means that the ground state has a preferred direction , leaving @xmath3 directions for the goldstone modes .",
    "since there are three pions , this suggests that @xmath8 and that the ground state of the theory should be symmetric under o(3 ) .",
    "the o(3 ) symmetry is the familiar isospin symmetry , which results in the near equality of the masses of the pions and of the mass of the proton and the neutron , fact @xmath7 .",
    "as was first conjectured by gell - mann and lvy @xcite , the theory of the strong force is based on an o(4 ) invariance spontaneously broken to o(3 ) with nucleons transforming according to su(2 ) .",
    "this is the familiar linear @xmath9-model .",
    "since the pions are not completely massless , a small o(4 ) symmetry - breaking mass term should also be present in the theory .",
    "the @xmath9-model is a phenomenological model for the interactions of pions and nucleons .",
    "it has been very successful in explaining many previously known empirical relations .",
    "our aim , however , is to understand chiral symmetry in terms of qcd , the fundamental theory of the strong interactions .",
    "quantum chromodynamics is a gauge theory of quarks that come in six different flavors and three different colors .",
    "the gauge field interaction is according to the non - abelian su(3 ) color group .",
    "two of the six quarks are nearly massless , and at low energies qcd is well approximated by a theory with only the two lightest quarks .",
    "they are mixed by the su(2 ) isospin symmetry group .",
    "this symmetry is exact for degenerate quark masses . for massless quarks",
    ", there is an additional symmetry .",
    "the helicity of a particle is a good quantum number , and the right - handed and left - handed quarks can be rotated independently .",
    "the isospin or vector symmetry rotates both chiralities in the same way whereas the axial su(2 ) group rotates them in the opposite direction .",
    "this explains that the chiral symmetry group in the massless case is @xmath10 , which is isomorphic to o(4 ) .",
    "the mass term breaks this symmetry explicitly and thus plays the role of the magnetic field in the spin system . even in the massless case , however , the vacuum state of qcd is characterized by a nonzero expectation value of the chiral condensate , which , like the mass term , mixes right - handed and left - handed quarks .",
    "thus , in the vacuum , the axial part of the symmetry group @xmath11 is broken spontaneously .",
    "the ground state is not unique , and the degenerate states are connected by the broken group @xmath11 .",
    "the degeneracy can be lifted by means of a small mass term , and in the thermodynamic limit the system will be frozen in this direction , i.e.  the direction of the qcd vacuum state is determined by the mass term .",
    "this is exactly the same situation as in the spin system discussed above .",
    "the goldstone modes analogous to spin waves are the pions , with a mass that is well below the typical hadronic mass scale of about 1gev . as in the spin system , we expect that the expectation value of the chiral condensate will become zero above a critical temperature .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "the chirally symmetric phase probably existed in the early universe and may be produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .    although qcd is the consistent theory of the strong interactions , many questions remain unanswered .",
    "for example , why have its constituents never been observed in nature ?",
    "this phenomenon is known as confinement and means that all physical states are color singlets .",
    "qcd is best understood at high energies , where , because of asymptotic freedom , quarks and gluons become weakly interacting and perturbative calculations are possible . at low energies , on the other hand ,",
    "it is necessary to rely on nonperturbative approaches .",
    "one approach is to study the qcd partition function by means of monte carlo simulations of a discretized version of the qcd action .",
    "this approach has been very fruitful , and a great deal of our understanding of low - energy qcd is based on such calculations ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "the drawback is that large - scale simulations do not necessarily provide a simple picture of the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , it is often advantageous to study qcd by means of effective models or theories .",
    "one example is the instanton liquid vacuum @xcite , which is a model for an ensemble of relevant gauge field configurations .",
    "effective low - energy theories are a second example .",
    "we already mentioned the @xmath9-model for pions and nucleons . however , because of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and the existence of a mass gap in qcd , one can do better . based on chiral symmetry",
    "one can formulate an exact low - energy theory for the goldstone modes .",
    "this nonlinear @xmath9-model is the basis for a systematic low - energy expansion @xcite that is discussed in detail in secs .",
    "[ sec1.3 ] and [ sec : effective ] .",
    "the qcd partition function can be written as a euclidean path integral that can be expressed as the expectation value of the fermion determinant , @xmath12 here the average is over all gauge fields weighted by the euclidean yang - mills action , the product is over quark flavors of mass @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the dirac operator , which we introduce in great detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : qcd ] .",
    "the fermion determinant can be expressed as a product over the eigenvalues @xmath15 of the dirac operator .",
    "therefore , we may also interpret the average as an average over the eigenvalues with probability distribution determined by the gauge field dynamics .",
    "we have argued that spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry means that a small quark mass leads to a macroscopic realignment of the qcd vacuum .",
    "it is clear from the qcd partition function that this is only possible if there is an accumulation of dirac eigenvalues near zero .",
    "otherwise , a small mass term would be completely dominated by the much larger eigenvalues in the factors of @xmath16 . for a free dirac operator in a four - dimensional box ,",
    "the eigenvalue density is proportional to @xmath17 and thus vanishes near zero .",
    "therefore , the small eigenvalues must be due to interactions mediated by the gauge fields .",
    "there are two possibilities .",
    "first , the eigenvalues may originate from the exactly zero dirac eigenvalues in the field of an instanton . at a nonzero density of the liquid of instantons and anti - instantons ,",
    "the zero eigenvalues are distributed over a band because of interactions that lift the degeneracy of the eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalue repulsion results in a nonzero eigenvalue density near zero .",
    "second , the eigenvalues may originate from the bulk of the dirac spectrum .",
    "as is the case for any interaction in quantum mechanics , the interactions mediated by the gauge fields lead to a repulsion of the eigenvalues . for increasing interaction strength , it is then advantageous for the eigenvalues to move to a region with a low eigenvalue density . both mechanisms of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking rely on the repulsion of eigenvalues in interacting systems .",
    "this topic has been investigated in detail by means of random matrix theory , discussed in the next subsection .",
    "as mentioned above , we expect chiral symmetry to be restored at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed by lattice qcd simulations , which show a critical temperature of about 150mev @xcite .",
    "however , there is another direction in which the qcd partition function can be explored , namely at nonzero baryon number density . in this domain ,",
    "rigorous results are available only at infinite baryon number density @xcite .",
    "this raises the question to what extent these results can be extrapolated to physically interesting densities . because of the complex phase of the fermion determinant , monte carlo simulations are not possible in this case .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that many of the recent developments in qcd at nonzero density are based on the analysis of effective models @xcite .",
    "the picture that has emerged for two massless flavors is that a first - order chiral phase transition occurs at zero temperature along the chemical potential axis .",
    "renormalization - group arguments and lattice qcd simulations indicate that for two massless flavors , a second - order phase transition occurs at zero chemical potential along the temperature axis .",
    "the expectation is that a line of first - order transitions and a line of second - order transitions will extend in the @xmath18 plane and will join at the tricritical point , as indicated in fig .",
    "a color - superconducting phase is conjectured to exist at higher densities @xcite but the discussion of this phase is beyond the scope of this review .",
    "one of the questions we address is the robustness of this picture based on the dynamics of the eigenvalues of the qcd dirac operator .",
    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) first appeared in the mathematical literature in 1928 @xcite and was first applied to physics in the context of nuclear resonances by wigner almost 50 years ago @xcite .",
    "at that time , theoretical approaches such as the shell model had been very successful in describing the low - lying excitations of complex nuclei .",
    "however , highly excited resonances , which can be observed experimentally by neutron scattering , could not be described by the microscopic theory .",
    "the problem is generic : for any complex quantum system containing many degrees of freedom with complicated dynamics , it is very hard , if not impossible , to obtain exact results for the energy levels far above the ground state of the system .",
    "having acknowledged that the highly excited states can not be predicted individually , one can ask whether the experimental data have some generic statistical features that can be described theoretically .",
    "this is where rmt comes in .",
    "every quantum system is described by a hamilton operator that can be expressed in matrix form . for a complex quantum system such as a large nucleus",
    ", this matrix is very complicated , and we may not even know its details . in this case , one approach is to assume that all interactions that are consistent with the symmetries of the system are equally likely .",
    "this means replacing the elements of the hamilton matrix by random numbers that are uncorrelated and distributed according to the same probability distribution . to obtain definite results , observables such as the level density must then be averaged over the random matrix elements .",
    "this defines a statistical theory of energy levels , which is mathematically known as rmt .",
    "an important point is that the random matrix must have the same symmetries as the original hamilton matrix .",
    "a collection of early papers on rmt can be found in the book by porter @xcite , and the standard reference on rmt is the book by mehta @xcite .",
    "can such an enormous simplification of the real problem describe empirical data ?",
    "a similar puzzle occurred in the theory of critical phenomena , in which the critical behavior does not depend on the detailed dynamics of the theory .",
    "the reason for this simplification is the appearance of a length scale , the correlation length , that diverges at the critical point .",
    "because of the corresponding separation of scales , it is possible to integrate out the short - wavelength fluctuations and renormalize the theory to a fixed - point theory that does not depend on the details of the initial theory .",
    "what is the separation of scales that takes place in quantum spectra ?",
    "the two basic scales are the average level spacing and the scale of the variation of the average level spacing .",
    "the equivalent of the correlation length is the inverse average level spacing , which diverges in the thermodynamic limit or the semiclassical limit .",
    "we thus expect that spectral properties on the scale of the average level spacing do not depend on the details of the underlying dynamics .",
    "they are universal .",
    "universal properties can be studied in the simplest model of a given universality class and , in this way , exact analytical results for the correlation functions can be obtained . in the case of spectral correlations",
    "the simplest models of the universality classes are the gaussian rmts , and in the past three decades many exact results have been derived for these models .",
    "unfortunately , in most cases it is not possible to prove whether a given theory belongs to one of the rmt universality classes .",
    "therefore , random matrix predictions are usually verified by comparisons with empirical data .",
    "since wigner s original proposal , universal quantities have been identified and computed in a variety of fields including nuclear physics , atomic and molecular physics , disordered mesoscopic systems , quantum systems with classically chaotic analogs , two - dimensional quantum gravity , conformal field theory , and qcd .",
    "a recent comprehensive review of the applications of rmt can be found in ref .",
    "rmt is now an independent subfield of mathematical physics .",
    "it provides a unifying description of universal statistical features of many different quantum systems and is applicable whenever a system is sufficiently complex .",
    "let us raise an interesting point here .",
    "the eigenvalues of the hamilton matrix for a given quantum system are the quantities of primary interest . instead of going through rmt to compute the eigenvalues , an alternative  and much simpler ",
    "approach might be to postulate random eigenvalues .",
    "it turns out that this does not describe empirical data , at least not if the random eigenvalues are uncorrelated .",
    "therefore , in addition , one would have to postulate how the eigenvalues are correlated , and it is not at all clear how to do this . in rmt , on the other hand , one starts with uncorrelated random matrix elements . at the end of the calculation",
    ", one finds that the resulting eigenvalues are strongly correlated in precisely the right way to describe the data .    in most applications",
    ", rmt is used to describe the statistics of energy levels , i.e.  of the eigenvalues of the hamilton operator . for the euclidean qcd partition function ,",
    "it is more natural to construct a random matrix model for the dirac operator .",
    "as shown in the previous subsection , the spectrum of this operator is intimately related to the phenomenon of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this establishes the connection between rmt and chiral symmetry announced in the title of this review .",
    "we use random matrix methods to study the dirac spectrum and its implications for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "it is important to note that rmt can only provide an exact description of universal quantities .",
    "it can not be used for the calculation of nonuniversal observables such as the average level spacing .",
    "such behavior is well known in statistical mechanics where , for example , the ising model describes the critical exponents of the liquid - gas phase transition but does not give the critical temperature . in the case of the distribution of the eigenvalues of a system",
    ", the global spectral density is not described by rmt .",
    "for example , for the gaussian random matrix ensembles the average spectral density is a semicircle , whereas in real systems it typically increases strongly with excitation energy .",
    "in contrast , universal quantities do not depend on the details of the dynamics of the system . in rmt",
    ", they do not depend on the distribution of the random matrix elements .",
    "it is crucial to distinguish the universal quantities from the model - dependent ones . in the first five sections of this review",
    ", we mainly concentrate on the universal , model - independent features that yield exact quantitative results .",
    "however , it is sometimes useful to construct random matrix models to obtain a qualitative description of the physics in a disordered system . as we show in sec .",
    "[ models ] , schematic random matrix models for qcd at nonzero temperature and density can yield important qualitative insights into problems that are otherwise difficult to tackle .",
    "let us now make the connection between qcd , effective low - energy theories for qcd , and chiral rmt .",
    "we concentrate here on the big picture , postponing a more detailed discussion to secs .",
    "[ sec : chrmt ] and [ sec : effective ] .    at low energies ,",
    "quarks and gluons are confined in hadrons , i.e.  the particles we observe in nature are composite objects . instead of attempting to describe the results of low - energy scattering experiments in terms of quarks and gluons , it is often simpler to use an effective theory whose elementary degrees of freedom are the lightest particles of the theory . as mentioned earlier , in qcd",
    "the low - lying degrees of freedom are the pions resulting from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "therefore , an essential ingredient in the construction of the effective low - energy theory is the requirement that it correctly incorporates the chiral symmetries of the original theory . since the up- and down - quark are not completely massless in nature , the pions are not massless but have a small mass of about 140mev .",
    "they are much lighter than the lightest non - goldstone particles , such as the @xmath19-meson or the nucleons , which have a mass of about @xmath20 1gev .",
    "this means that at sufficiently low energies , the qcd partition function is well approximated by the partition function of an effective low - energy theory involving only pions .",
    "we now consider qcd in a finite euclidean volume @xmath21 .",
    "the partition function is then dominated by the pions if @xmath22 this statement follows from eq .",
    "( [ trace ] ) below by comparing the contribution of the pion , @xmath23 , to that of a heavier particle , @xmath24 .",
    "the interactions of the pions are described by an effective chiral lagrangian that will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : effective ] .",
    "the fields in this lagrangian can be separated into zero - momentum modes ( constant fields ) and nonzero - momentum modes .",
    "it was realized by gasser and leutwyler @xcite that there exists a kinematic regime where the fluctuations of the zero - momentum modes dominate the fluctuations of the nonzero - momentum modes .",
    "this regime is given by the condition @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the pion mass .",
    "intuitively , this means that the wavelength of the pion is much larger than the linear extent of the box .",
    "thus , the pion field does not vary appreciably over the size of the box , so the derivative terms are small .",
    "( these statements are quantified in sec .",
    "[ sec : effective ] . )",
    "we need consider only the zero - momentum modes in the regime of eq .",
    "( [ lmpi ] ) . for constant fields ,",
    "the spacetime integral in the action can be replaced by the four - volume , and , effectively , we only have to deal with a much simpler zero - dimensional theory",
    ". however , the global symmetries remain important .",
    "we are now ready to make the connection to chiral rmt .",
    "a random matrix , as introduced in the previous subsection , contains independently distributed random variables .",
    "each element of the matrix has the same average size .",
    "on the other hand , the matrix elements of the dirac operator contain specific correlations due to the gauge fields and the kinetic terms , which are not included in the rmt .",
    "only the global symmetries of qcd are included in the rmt .",
    "since the random matrix elements do not have any spacetime dependence , we expect that in the domain of eq .",
    "( [ lmpi ] ) , which is dominated by constant fields , the rmt reproduces the mass dependence of the finite - volume partition function .    to summarize , the three ingredients in the construction of the finite - volume effective theory from qcd in the regime of eq .",
    "( [ lmpi ] ) are the following : @xmath6 the global symmetries of qcd , @xmath7 the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , and @xmath27 the fact that the partition function is dominated by the constant goldstone fields .",
    "there is an almost one - to - one correspondence to the properties of the chiral random matrix model @xcite : @xmath6 the dirac matrix is replaced by a random matrix with the same global symmetries , @xmath7 chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously in the limit of infinitely large random matrices , and @xmath27 the random matrix elements do not have any spacetime dependence .",
    "after the introductory remarks on our basic philosophy in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] , we now present a detailed discussion of the properties of the qcd partition function and the dirac operator .      the qcd partition function is defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the inverse temperature and @xmath30 is the qcd hamiltonian in a box of volume @xmath31 . it can be rewritten as a ( suitably regularized ) functional integral in euclidean space , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of quark flavors and @xmath34 is the euclidean yang - mills action .",

    "the structure of the qcd lagrangian is to a large extent determined by symmetries and renormalizability .",
    "as noted above , it is important to analyze these symmetries to construct the correct effective low - energy theory and the correct random matrix model .",
    "we now discuss three important global symmetries of the partition function and the dirac operator .",
    "the dirac operator satisfies @xmath45 this relation is a compact expression of chiral symmetry , i.e.  of the fact that right - handed and left - handed quarks can be rotated independently .",

    "see refs .",

    "one class of matrix models for qcd are lattice qcd partition functions on a @xmath410 lattice .",
    "the simplest model in this class is the one - plaquette partition function for pure gauge theory in @xmath568 .",
    "this model is known as the brzin - gross - witten model @xcite and is defined by @xmath569 where the integral is over the haar measure of u(@xmath181 ) and @xmath570 is an arbitrary complex source term .",

    "a large-@xmath181 chiral phase transition is obtained by extending this model with a fermion determinant @xcite . despite considerable effort , the generalization of this model to more than two dimensions , which is known as the eguchi - kawai model @xcite ,",
    "could not be solved analytically @xcite .",
    "the brzin - gross - witten model @xcite can be rewritten as a generalized kontsevich model , which has received a great deal of attention in the theory of exactly integrable systems @xcite .",
    "there are many other relations between rmt and the theory of exactly solvable systems . among others , the asymptotic properties of correlation functions",
    "can be derived by means of conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "an interesting overview in the context of string theory is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another class of related models is the kazakov - migdal model @xcite , which is also known as induced qcd . in its simplest form",
    "it is defined by @xmath573 } \\:,\\ ] ] where the @xmath574 are hermitian matrices and the @xmath575 are unitary matrices .",
    "the sum is over a lattice in @xmath411 dimensions .",
    "a zero - dimensional form of this model was proposed as a model for the transition between poisson statistics and wigner - dyson statistics @xcite .      in condensed matter physics ,",
    "a mesoscopic system is a system whose linear size is larger than the elastic mean free path of the electrons but smaller than the phase coherence length , which is essentially the inelastic mean free path .",
    "a typical size is about 1  @xmath436 m .",
    "the conductance @xmath572 of mesoscopic samples is closely related to their spectral properties . using a scaling block picture",
    ", thouless found that in the diffusive regime , the conductance is given by @xmath576 , where @xmath577 is the inverse diffusion time of an electron through the sample and @xmath397 is the mean level spacing @xcite .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath578 , where @xmath579 is the mean level number in an energy interval @xmath401 .",
    "thus the variance , @xmath580 , of the conductance is related to the number variance , @xmath276 , of the energy levels @xcite .",
    "low - temperature experiments have been performed in which the conductance of mesoscopic wires was measured as a function of an external magnetic field .",
    "the observed fluctuations in @xmath572 are of the order of @xmath581 , independent of the details of the system ( shape , material , etc ) .",
    "these are the so - called universal conductance fluctuations @xcite",
    ". one can understand this phenomenon qualitatively by estimating the number fluctuations of the electron levels using rmt results .",
    "both the magnitude of the fluctuations and their universality can be obtained through the transfer matrix method .",
    "an interesting numerical result is that the density of eigenvalues of the transmission matrix in the hofstadter model for universal conductance fluctuations can be described in terms of the microscopic spectral density of the chue @xcite .      in more than two dimensions ,",
    "a good conductor becomes an insulator when the disorder becomes sufficiently strong .",
    "this phenomenon is called anderson localization . in the localized phase ,",
    "the wave function of the electron is not described by bloch waves , but by a localized form that decays exponentially , @xmath582 the length scale @xmath583 is known as the localization length .",
    "this phenomenon was first described by the anderson model @xcite , which is a hopping model with a random potential on each lattice point .",
    "the dimensionality of the lattice plays an important role .",
    "it has been shown that in one dimension all states are localized .",
    "the critical dimension is two , whereas in three dimensions there is a delocalization transition at an energy @xmath584 .",
    "the states below @xmath584 are localized whereas the states above @xmath584 are extended , i.e.  with a wave function that scales with the size of the system .",
    "the eigenvalues of the localized states are not correlated , and their correlations are described by the poisson distribution .    an interesting question is whether dirac eigenfunctions can be exponentially localized .",
    "parisi argued that localized states can only occur in quenched systems @xcite .",
    "in qcd this argument goes as follows .",
    "if the eigenfunctions were spatially localized , the eigenvalues would be uncorrelated , and there would be no repulsion between the eigenvalues . because of the fermion determinant and the measure in eq .",
    "( [ zeig ] ) , the eigenvalues would be repelled from the origin . since there would be no mechanism to compensate for this repulsion , @xmath302 and the chiral condensate would be zero .",
    "therefore , if chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , the eigenfunctions of the dirac operator must be spatially extended .",
    "indeed , this has been found for the wave functions of the dirac operator for a gauge field ensemble given by a liquid of instantons @xcite as well as in lattice qcd @xcite .    in the extended domain ,",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "an important energy scale is the thouless energy @xcite , which is related to the diffusion time of an electron through the sample ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : ucf ] ) . with that diffusion time given by @xmath585 ( the diffusion constant is denoted by @xmath586 ) , the thouless energy is @xcite @xmath587 on time scales larger than @xmath588 , an initially localized wave packet diffuses all over phase space . if this wave function @xmath589 at @xmath590 is expressed as a superposition of eigenfunctions @xmath591 , many of the overlaps @xmath592 are nonzero . therefore we expect that for energy differences below @xmath371 the eigenvalues are correlated according to rmt .",
    "the diffusive behavior of electrons is described by goldstone modes , called diffusons .",
    "classically , they satisfy a diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "the diffusion modes can be described in terms of a @xmath9-model , which has the same structure as the low - energy effective theory for the qcd partition function .",
    "the thouless energy corresponds to the energy scale below which the fluctuations of the zero - momentum modes dominate the fluctuations of the nonzero - momentum modes , i.e.  the scale discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : domains ] , below which the qcd dirac spectra are given by chrmt .",
    "the analysis of classically chaotic quantum systems has made it clear that spectra are described by rmt if and only if the corresponding classical motion is chaotic @xcite .",
    "if we interpret the dirac operator as a hamiltonian in four euclidean dimensions plus one artificial time dimension , we thus conclude that the classical motion of the quarks is chaotic @xcite and therefore diffusive in four euclidean dimensions and one artificial time dimension , in agreement with the interpretation of goldstone modes as diffusion modes @xcite .",
    "the equivalent of the diffusion constant can be read off immediately by comparing the two @xmath9-models , or equivalently by comparing the scale of eq .",
    "( [ spectralrange ] ) with the thouless energy , and is given by @xmath593 @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanically , the thouless energy can be interpreted as the spreading width of the exact eigenstates over the states of the noninteracting hamiltonian @xcite .      in the past few years",
    ", several non - hermitian models with disorder have been introduced in the literature .",
    "we mention only the simplest model , which was motivated by the study of flux - line pinning in superconductors @xcite .",
    "its hamiltonian is given by @xmath594 where @xmath595 is a random disorder potential , * p * is the momentum operator , and @xmath596 is a constant imaginary vector potential .",
    "the new feature of such models is that a localization - delocalization transition can occur even in one and two dimensions .",
    "although the wave functions corresponding to real eigenvalues remain localized , the wave functions of complex eigenvalues can be extended . for a detailed discussion of such models , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the dependence on @xmath597 in the hamiltonian @xmath30 occurs only in the combination @xmath598 , i.e.  in exactly the same way as the chemical potential in the qcd dirac operator .",
    "there are two important differences from qcd : @xmath6 the operator @xmath30 does not have a chiral structure , and @xmath7 the disorder is uncorrelated gaussian and quenched .",
    "the connection between delocalization in the hatano - nelson model ( [ hn ] ) and diquark condensation in quenched qcd at nonzero chemical potential is not yet understood and deserves further attention .",
    "after the initial work of ginibre @xcite , non - hermitian rmt has received a great deal of attention in the mathematics literature as well .",
    "probably the best overview of results in this area is in the book by girko @xcite .",
    "the term andreev scattering ( or andreev reflection ) refers to a process in which an electron hits the interface between a normal metal and a superconductor and is reflected as a hole with the opposite momentum ( or vice versa ) @xcite .",
    "stated differently , two electrons can tunnel through the interface so that a cooper pair is added to the superconducting condensate ( or removed from it ) .",
    "this process can be described in a microscopic mean field model by the bogoliubov - degennes hamiltonian , which can be written in matrix form as @xmath599 where @xmath112 ( @xmath600 ) represents the hamiltonian for particles ( holes ) and @xmath601 represents the pairing field .",
    "the requirement that @xmath30 be hermitian means that @xmath112 must be hermitian .",
    "if the system under consideration is invariant under time reversal or spin rotation or both , there may be additional symmetries .",
    "if the system is invariant under spin rotation , @xmath601 is symmetric ( in this case we consider the hamiltonian in the space of spin - up states only ) . if , in addition , the system is invariant under time reversal , the elements of @xmath30 are real",
    "otherwise , they are complex . on the other hand ,",
    "if the system is not invariant under spin rotation , @xmath601 is antisymmetric . in this case , if the system is invariant under time reversal , the elements of @xmath30 are quaternion real . otherwise , they are complex .",
    "this classification establishes four new random matrix ensembles @xcite .",
    "the microscopic spectral correlations of these ensembles are identical to those of the chiral ensembles if the parameters ( the dyson index @xmath29 and the number of massless flavors @xmath33 ) are chosen appropriately .",
    "rmt has received a great deal of attention as a problem in mathematical physics .",
    "we mention the relation between universal behavior in rmt and the asymptotic behavior of orthogonal polynomials @xcite , the relation between the classification of random matrix ensembles and the cartan classification of symmetric spaces @xcite , and the theory of riemannian superspaces @xcite .",
    "various methods for the solution of random matrix problems have been proposed .",
    "we mention the mapping to a gas of noninteracting fermions , the coulomb gas method @xcite , the brownian motion method @xcite , the replica method @xcite , the orthogonal polynomial method @xcite , the supersymmetric method @xcite , and the operator method @xcite .",
    "generally , the problem for @xmath213 is much simpler than for @xmath602 and @xmath387 .",

    "novel mathematical methods have been developed for @xmath124 and @xmath387 .",
    "we mention only the skew - orthogonal polynomial method @xcite and the extension of an operator method for @xmath122 @xcite .",

    "@xcite and di franceso et al .",
    "the idea is that the partition function , which is a sum over all metrics , can be rewritten as a sum over random surfaces .",
    "the sum over the dual graphs of a discretization of these random surfaces can be rewritten in terms of a random matrix partition function that can be analyzed with standard random matrix methods .",
    "chiral random matrix theory is the archetypal model for the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry . in chrmt",
    ", chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken for any finite number of massless flavors , whereas in qcd , breaking is believed to occur only below a certain number of massless flavors , perhaps as few as four . in this review , we have studied chiral symmetry breaking from the perspective of the eigenvalues of the qcd dirac operator , where broken chiral symmetry implies that the smallest eigenvalues are spaced as @xmath148 . the robustness of chiral symmetry breaking in chrmt can then be understood as the crystallization of the eigenvalues by the long - range random interactions .",
    "the number of eigenvalues in a sequence containing @xmath181 eigenvalues fluctuates on average only by @xmath603 as opposed to @xmath182 for uncorrelated eigenvalues . for uncorrelated eigenvalues",
    ", we do not expect chiral symmetry breaking for any number of massless flavors .",
    "the conclusion is that chiral symmetry breaking in qcd requires strongly correlated dirac eigenvalues but not quite as strongly correlated as in chrmt . to make this conclusion more quantitative ,",
    "we have formulated an effective theory for the qcd dirac spectrum , which , in addition to the usual goldstone modes , contains goldstone bosons of spectral quarks that are `` ghost '' quarks introduced to probe the dirac spectrum . like the usual chiral lagrangian , this lagrangian consists of a kinetic term and a mass term .",
    "an important scale is the spectral mass for which the long - wavelength fluctuations of these two terms are of equal order of magnitude . in the theory of disordered condensed matter systems , this scale is known as the thouless energy . for spectral masses below the thouless energy ,",
    "the mass dependence is given by the zero - momentum sector of the effective theory , and it coincides with that of chrmt in the limit of large matrices .",
    "the deviations from chrmt , given by the contributions of the nonzero - momentum modes , increase the fluctuations of the eigenvalues .",
    "for an increasing number of flavors , the position of the smallest eigenvalues moves to the right , whereas the slope of the spectral density increases with @xmath33 .",
    "however , chiral symmetry remains broken for any value of @xmath33 .",
    "the chiral condensate is simply a parameter of the effective partition function .",
    "the statistical properties of the qcd dirac eigenvalues have been investigated by numerous lattice qcd simulations , and the chrmt predictions have been verified in great detail .",
    "the behavior of dirac spectra in the domain beyond the thouless energy has been less well studied , but in all cases , the predictions of the effective theory for the dirac spectrum agree well with lattice simulations .    inspired by the successes of chrmt as an exact description of the statistical properties of the qcd dirac spectrum , we have constructed a schematic model for the chiral phase transition .",
    "although this approach does not provide rigorous results , it has been useful in advancing a qualitative understanding of the chiral phase transition at both zero and nonzero chemical potential .",
    "examples are the properties of the dirac spectrum in the approach to the critical temperature , the failure of the quenched approximation at @xmath437 , and the phase diagram of the qcd partition function in the @xmath604 plane .",
    "finally , rmt encapsulates a duality between order and chaos .",

    "<S> we show that constraints imposed by chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking determine the structure of low - energy effective partition functions for the dirac spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we thus derive exact results for the low - lying eigenvalues of the qcd dirac operator . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the statistical properties of these eigenvalues are universal and can be described by a random matrix theory with the global symmetries of the qcd partition function . the total number of such eigenvalues increases with the square root of the euclidean four - volume . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral density for larger eigenvalues ( but still well below a typical hadronic mass scale ) also follows from the same low - energy effective partition function . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the random matrix approach has been confirmed by many lattice qcd simulations in a wide parameter range . </S>",
    "<S> stimulated by the success of the chiral random matrix theory in the description of universal properties of the dirac eigenvalues , the random matrix model is extended to nonzero temperature and chemical potential . in this way we obtain qualitative results for the qcd phase diagram and the spectrum of the qcd dirac operator . </S>",
