    "it is apparent from the observed mass segregation that , while star formation in w3 is occurring with the greatest vigor in the hdl , lower - level star formation has been ( and may still be ) taking place outside the prominent clusters .",
    "combining our 90prime photometry with 2mass data and @xmath75 photometry from @xcite allows us to constrain the wavelength dependence of extinction for the line - of - sight toward w3 . for each star",
    ", we compute as many as possible of the color excesses @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "the intrinsic colors for each spectral type are taken from @xcite and @xcite , with the johnson @xmath80 and @xmath5 bands converted to 2mass @xmath80 and @xmath55 using the transformations of @xcite .",
    "the instrinsic colors of o - type stars from the more recent @xcite study are slightly redder than those given by other references and do not align with the color scale for b - type stars .",
    "if we shift our entire intrinsic color scale to align with that of @xcite , the color excess ratios remain the same but the resulting extinctions decrease by an average of @xmath81 mag .",
    "to constrain the extinction at various wavelengths , we consider the parameter @xmath82 , defined here as    @xmath83    ( we adopt the conventional notation @xmath1 for the value of @xmath84 . )",
    "it can be shown that    @xmath85    in figure [ fig : ecolor ] , we plot @xmath79 against the other color excesses calculated for each star where available .",
    "we compute the slope of the relationship with a least - squares fit , fixing the intercept at zero under the assumption that zero extinction in any one filter means zero extinction in all observed filters . only for the fit of @xmath79 against @xmath76",
    "does this assumption have any effect on the calculated slope . from the color excess ratios , we find that @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "we note that @xmath1 is at least @xmath89 , the average for the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) in the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and greater than the @xmath90 found for neighboring w4 by @xcite .",
    "the latter , however , is likely an artificially low estimate , as they assumed a spectrophotometric distance of 2.4 kpc to w3 in their analysis .",
    "lacking independent measures of the absolute magnitudes for any of our sources , we are unable to put upper limits on @xmath82 from our data alone . instead",
    ", we turn to the range of @xmath91 measurements in the literature in order to normalize our extinction law . iterating on the @xmath1-dependent @xcite extinction law , we arrive at @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "similarly , the equations of @xcite produce @xmath94 .",
    "adopting @xmath93 , we find for w3 that @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the resulting extinction ratios are @xmath97 .",
    "these ratios are consistent with the @xcite extinction law for @xmath92 , with the higher - than - average @xmath1 likely due to the contribution of larger grains in the w3 gmc . using these values , the visual extinction toward the o- and b - type stars in w3 ranges from @xmath98 mag to @xmath99 mag , with an average of @xmath100 mag .    in their study of massive stars in w3",
    "main , @xcite found that the @xcite extinction law was the best fit for their @xmath60 data .",
    "this extinction law , derived for sightlines toward the galactic center , has an unusually low @xmath91 ratio of @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "if we adopt that value toward w3 , we find that @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and the extinction ratios are @xmath105 .",
    "the resulting @xmath106 ratio of @xmath107 is anomalously steep , even compared to that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* who found @xmath108 ) .",
    "for the rest of our analysis , we therefore adopt the more typical @xmath93 described above . if we do use the lower @xmath91 ratio , our resultant source luminosities decrease by a median of @xmath109 dex , but our overall conclusions are unaffected .",
    "using the extinction values from the previous section , we convert our observed stellar data to physical parameters and construct a hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram .",
    "stellar temperatures are assigned based on spectral type : temperatures of o - type stars are from the `` observational '' scale of @xcite and those of b - type stars are from @xcite and @xcite . observed @xmath11 magnitudes are corrected for extinction and a distance of @xmath25 kpc before bolometric corrections ( bcs ) applicable for each spectral type are applied .",
    "we use bcs from @xcite for all o - type stars , from @xcite for b4-a1v stars , and from @xcite for biii and b0 - 3v stars , to provide a smooth transition from o - type to b - type dwarfs .",
    "the final h - r diagram is presented in figure [ fig : hriso ] .",
    "uncertainites on individual points for both temperature and luminosity are dominated by the uncertainties in spectral type .",
    "luminosity values are also affected by the normalization of the extinction law , but for clarity we do not plot this systematic uncertainty . the majority of the stars are consistent with lying on the main sequence and there is no obvious main - sequence turnoff .",
    "overall , there is no evidence for a population older than @xmath11010 myr .",
    "interstingly , the sources with h@xmath37 emission and/or _ wise _ ir excess do not occupy any special location in the h - r diagram .",
    "three of the five hottest optically - detected stars in w3 belong to known star - forming clusters .",
    "bd+61@xmath111411 is an o6.5v((f ) ) star @xcite that dominates the ionization budget of ic 1795 , and nfd 559 @xcite is the visually - brightest member of w3 main .",
    "based on the positions of bd+61@xmath111411 and owk 3041 in their h - r diagram , @xcite found a 35 myr age spread for ic 1795 assuming @xmath112 and a spectrophotometric distance of 2.3 kpc .",
    "we find the same age spread despite using a different distance and extinction law .",
    "in addition , the @xmath113 myr age we estimate for nr 559 is consistent with the 13 myr age for w3 main found by @xcite .",
    "( the youngest members of w3 main are poorly represented in our h - r diagram because they are heavily extincted and therefore undetected in @xmath11 . )    the two hottest optically - detected stars in w3 are w3 north , the ionizing star of a small region , and our source # 21 .",
    "@xcite did not detect any low - mass stars around w3 north in the x - ray , leading them to suggest that it was a runaway star ejected from ic 1795 or ic 1805 .",
    "the observed age of @xmath114 myr is broadly consistent with either scenario .",
    "our source # 21 is one of the serendipitiously - detected spectroscopic binaries and is composed of two o - type stars .",
    "this system does not appear to be associated with any known cluster , although it lies near a dense filament of the hdl ( see figure [ fig : spacefig ] ) .",
    "further study of the surrounding lower - mass population is necessary before we draw any conclusions about the origins of source # 21 .",
    "the brightest star in w3 with h@xmath37 emission is nfd 3 , a heavily - extincted object to the southeast of ic 1795 .",
    "@xcite identified this star as an evolved b0iiie - b1iiie based on its @xmath5-band spectrum .",
    "although we observed this star with hectospec , we were unable to confirm any spectral type from its optical features .",
    "however , this object s position in the h - r diagram is consistent with that of a star approaching the end of its main - sequence lifetime . as such , it is suggestive of a @xmath115-myr - old population in w3 .",
    "another source of note is irs n4 ( our source # 31 ) , an early b - type star associated with the region w3 k in w3 main .",
    "@xcite suggested that irs n4 is a massive protostar still in the final stages of contraction to the zams , a hypothesis consistent with its position on the outskirts of w3 main but inconsistent with its visibility in @xmath11 and its relatively mature region .",
    "it is possible that irs n4 , like nfd 3 , is in fact a somewhat evolved star that formed before the rest of w3 main .",
    "a source that stands out in our h - r diagram is irs 2a , an h@xmath37-emitting o - type star lying noticably below the zams .",
    "irs 2a is associated with the compact region w3 a in w3 main @xcite and is therefore unlikely to be a background star .",
    "in addition , its known near - infrared excess @xcite may have caused us to slightly overestimate its extinction : the @xmath116 derived from @xmath79 for irs 2a is 1.3 mag higher than the @xmath116 derived from @xmath77 .",
    "however , the relatively dense molecular material surrounding irs 2a may have a higher @xmath1 than the w3 average . placing irs 2a on or above the zams",
    "requires that it have a minimum @xmath116 of 11.3 mag , which translates to an @xmath1 of 4.0 or greater .",
    "we note that the source in our sample with the highest measured @xmath116 , star # 27 ( nfd 386 ) , is also located in the heart of w3 main .",
    "finally , we note that km cas , the o - type star responsible for lighting up a bright - rimmed cloud near afgl 333 , is often considered a member of ic 1805 .",
    "however , with our new determination of its extinction , the apparent age of km cas is @xmath15 myr , older than the 13 myr age of the main ic 1805 cluster @xcite .",
    "this star is thus also consistent with the interpretation that star formation began in w3 before the current ob clusters appeared .",
    "we can gain additional insight into the high - mass stellar population of w3 by exploring the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "we assigned approximate masses to each star based on its spectral type : o - type stellar masses are from the `` observational '' scale of @xcite ; masses of unevolved b - type stars are derived by interpolating the @xmath117 zams from @xcite to the temperature for each type ; and masses of evolved b - type stars are taken from the mass - spectral type relations of @xcite .",
    "none of the stars in w3 are massive enough to have experienced significant mass loss over their lifetimes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the current masses are representative of the inital masses .",
    "the resulting cumulative mass function is shown in figure [ fig : imffig ] .    for stellar masses greater than approximately solar ,",
    "the imf is typically expressed as a power law of the form @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is a @xcite imf .",
    "we fit our cumulative histogram in logarithmic space with a straight line of the form @xmath120 using least - squares regression and treating the errors on @xmath121 as poissonian ( i.e. , @xmath122 ) .",
    "the use of a cumulative histogram instead of a standard one removes the slope dependence on bin size ; however , the fit is still strongly dependent on the mass completeness limit .",
    "if we assume the sample is complete down to stars of type b6v , we find @xmath123 . for fits assuming that the sample becomes incomplete for types later than b4v and b2v , we find @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively , as the fit increasingly emphasizes the steep upper end of the observed imf .",
    "the observational imf is almost certainly undercounting the number of high - mass stars found in unresolved multiple systems .",
    "half or more  perhaps even close to @xmath126  of massive star systems are multiples @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mass ratio distribution of massive systems is roughly uniform , so massive stars are more likely to have massive companions than if their companions were drawn from a standard imf @xcite . indeed , for two stars ( see section [ subsec : interesting ] )",
    ", we see evidence for similar - mass companions in the stellar spectra . lack of evidence for binarity in the other observed systems is not evidence for a lack of companions , as we did not search for radial velocity variations and it was only by chance that the two sb2 systems were observed near quadrature .",
    "we explore the effect of unresolved binaries on the imf via a monte carlo simulation .",
    "each star in our sample is randomly assigned a binarity status , assuming binary fractions between @xmath127 and @xmath29 . if a binary , we assign a companion mass by drawing from a uniform mass ratio distribution between @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the range of possible imfs produced from @xmath130 repetitions of this simulation is shown in figure [ fig : imffig ] . with binaries",
    "added , the imf steepens slightly , but it remains consistent with salpeter for @xmath131 m / m@xmath72 @xmath132 .",
    "the drop - off of the observed imf above @xmath14 m@xmath72 is likely the result of small - number statistics .",
    "the multi - cluster nature of w3 may also be responsible , since the relationship between cluster mass and the mass of its most massive star causes the observed high - mass imf to steepen in composite populations @xcite .",
    "however , ic 1795 is old enough that a star of mass @xmath133 m@xmath4 , whose presence would fill out the top end of the w3 imf , could have already gone supernova .    assuming that the high - mass imf in w3 is well - described by a salpeter slope",
    ", we can extrapolate to estimate the size of the intermediate - mass stellar population .",
    "normalizing a salpeter imf to account for unresolved binaries and the seven b - type stars without firm spectral types , we calculate that there are @xmath1109001000 stars with m @xmath134 m@xmath72 across w3 . in comparison , @xcite identified @xmath135 members and @xmath136 candidate members of ic 1795 based on x - ray and ir data . excluding the @xmath137 or so of their sources with m",
    "@xmath138m@xmath72 , these numbers imply that 3050@xmath139 of the stars across our square - degree field of w3 are concentrated in a single cluster of radius 6  in the hdl .",
    "with a wide - field imaging survey and multi - fiber spectroscopy , we have characterized 109 o- and b - type stars in the w3 star - forming region , including 83 previously unclassified sources ( four of which are a - type stars ) .",
    "we have shown that the slope of the high - mass imf in w3 is consistent with salpeter ( @xmath140 ) , and that the extinction toward w3 approximately follows the @xcite extinction law with @xmath141 .",
    "our detection of a population of b - type stars outside the hdl adds to the growing collection of evidence indicating that star formation has taken place throughout the w3 gmc .",
    "our results corroborate the existence of the @xmath142-myr - old population detected in the @xmath5-band luminosity function by @xcite , and we have identified a more distributed and possibly older population than that seen by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "diffuse stellar populations of this nature are common among star - forming regions of all sizes , ranging from taurus @xcite to orion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the carina nebula cluster @xcite , where more than half of the x - ray - identified young stars are found spread across a @xmath143-pc region outside groups and clusters .",
    "the h - r diagram of the o- and b - type stellar population in w3 also supports the interpretation that low - level star formation began throughout the w3 cloud 810 myr ago .",
    "the timing of this initial star formation may have coincided with the first star formation episode in neighboring w4 , which appears to have occurred 610 myr ago @xcite .",
    "however , it is clear from the spatial distribution of both the observed massive stars and the extrapolated intermediate - mass population that the star formation in w3 has been highly concentrated in the hdl over the past 35 myr .",
    "although the association of increased star formation rates with dense gas surrounding an expanding superbubble is not direct evidence that the latter triggered the former @xcite , it is very suggestive of a causal relationship between feedback and accelerated star formation .",
    "it remains possible that the observed distributed population in w3 is the remnant of an older cluster that has since dispersed . at the distance of w3 ( @xmath25 kpc ) , a star with a transverse motion of @xmath27 km s@xmath10",
    "will cover @xmath144 in @xmath145 myr , allowing an unbound cluster to disperse over @xmath27 deg@xmath146 .",
    "the presence of the w3 gmc is an argument against this hypothesis , however , as the natal cloud of an older cluster should have largely dispersed after @xmath145 myr ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "_ gaia _ will be able to test this possibility directly , as it is expected to measure the proper motions of @xmath147 mag stars to a precision of @xmath148as yr@xmath10 @xcite , which translates to @xmath149 km s@xmath10 at the distance of w3 .",
    "the next step to understanding the origin and history of the distributed stellar population in w3 is a study of the intermediate- and low - mass stars across the region . at 810 myr after the commencement of star formation , stars less massive than @xmath114 m@xmath72 will still be contracting toward the main sequence @xcite , potentially allowing a more precise age determination . both early- and late - type b stars",
    "are expected to form surrounded by close groups of lower - mass stars @xcite ; if such groups prove to be lacking , the argument for a dispersed cluster remnant is strengthened .",

    "<S> this broader b - type population suggests that star formation in w3 began spontaneously up to 810 myr ago , although at a lower level than the more recent star formation episodes in the hdl . </S>",
