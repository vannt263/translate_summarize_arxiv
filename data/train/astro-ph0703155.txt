    "f675w images ( including [ sii ] , h@xmath19 , and [ oi ] lines ) separated by one year , but because of differences in sensitivity between both images , proper motion measurements were restricted to the region within @xmath20 from the star ; finally , lpez et al .",
    "( 1996 ) obtained proper motions for five knots of the hh  30 jet , and for hh 266 , from two [ sii ] images separated by about one year , but obtained with different instrumentation .    in the present paper , we used sensitive ccd frames obtained at two epochs with the same instrument , in order to make a detailed study of the proper motions along the region .",
    "our observations are complementary to those carried out with the _ hst _ telescope , since the _ hst _ covers with very high angular resolution the brightest region near ( a few arcsec ) the exciting sources , while our observations cover a much more extended , low brightness region , up to @xmath21 from the exciting sources .",
    "we measured proper motions for a number of knots much larger than in previous studies , in order to obtain the full kinematics of the region .",
    "given the proximity of the region ( @xmath22 pc ) , a time span of one year between the two images allowed us to measure the proper motions with enough accuracy , and made easier the identification of the knots .",
    "we compared our proper motion results with those obtained in previous studies in order to obtain the time evolution of the jet structures .",

    "ccd images of the hl tauri region , including the hh  30 jet and the hh  30-n and hh 266 emission structures , were obtained at two different epochs ( 1998 november 20 and 1999",

    ", the nominal alfosc field is @xmath27 .",
    "however , because of the square geometry of the [ sii ] filter used and the misalignment with the ccd axes , the effective field sampled through the filter was only @xmath28 .",
    "the images were processed with the standard tasks of the iraf reduction package .",
    "individual frames were recentered using the reference positions of several field stars , in order to correct for the misalignments among them .",
    "the `` first epoch '' not image was obtained by combining five frames of 1800  s exposure each , in order to get a deep [ sii ] image of 2.5 h of integration time .",
    "typical values of seeing for individual frames were @xmath29@xmath30 , resulting in a seeing of @xmath29 for the final `` first epoch '' image .",
    "the `` second epoch '' not image was obtained by combining eight frames of 1800  s exposure each in order to get a final image with a total integration time of 4 h. for this second epoch , the typical values of seeing for individual frames were @xmath31@xmath29 , resulting in a seeing of @xmath31 for the final `` second epoch '' image .",
    "images were not flux - calibrated .",
    "however , we have performed aperture photometry of comon field stars on the images of the two epochs and we estimate that the deepness of the two images differs by less than 0.5 mag in the filter used .      to measure the proper motions , the first- and second - epoch [ sii ] ccd final images were converted into a common reference system by using the positions of eleven field stars plus the position of the hh  30 star .",
    "the @xmath32 axis is oriented at a position angle ( p.a . ) of @xmath33 , roughly coincident with the hh  30 jet axis .",
    "the geomap and geotran tasks of iraf were used to perform a linear transformation with six free parameters taking into account relative translation , rotations and magnifications between frames . after the transformation , the average and rms of the difference in position for the reference stars in the two images was @xmath34 pixels in the @xmath35 coordinate and @xmath36 pixels in the @xmath32 coordinate .    in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio of the diffuse knot structures , the aligned images were convolved with gaussian filters using the gauss iraf task .",
    "for the knots nearest to the hh  30 star ( i.e. , knots a  d and counterjet ) , a gaussian filter with a fwhm of @xmath37 was applied to both images . for the rest of the knots the gaussian filter applied to the images had a fwhm of @xmath38 .",
    "we defined boxes that included the emission of the individual condensations in each epoch , we computed the two - dimensional cross - correlation function of the emission within the boxes , and finally we determined the proper motion through a parabolic fit to the peak of the cross - correlation function ( see the description of this method in reipurth et al .  1992 , and lpez et al .",
    "the uncertainty in the position of the correlation peak has been estimated through the scatter of the correlation peak positions obtained from boxes differing from the nominal one in 0 or @xmath39 pixels ( @xmath40 ) in any of its four sides , making a total @xmath41 different boxes for each knot .",
    "the error adopted has been twice the rms deviation of position , for each coordinate , added quadratically to the rms alignment error .",
    "for the knots near the hh  30 source ( knots a  d and counterjet ) , the intensity gradient in the jet direction made unreliable the usage of the correlation method . for this region , we integrated the emission across the jet over a width of 11 pixels ( @xmath42 ) and identified the position of each knot along the jet through a parabolic fit after baseline removal .  a similar procedure , but integrating the emission along the jet for a typical width of 6 pixels ( @xmath43 ) at the position of each knot , allowed us to measure the @xmath35 coordinate of the knots .",
    "for these knots we estimated that the major source of error was the residual misalignment of the two images , and the uncertainty adopted for the proper motions was @xmath44 times the rms alignment error for each coordinate .",
    "however , we can not discard that residual contamination from continuum emission constitutes an additional source of uncertainty in our proper motion measurements of the knots nearest to the hh  30 source .",
    "optical spectroscopy of the hh  30 jet and hh  30-n was acquired during 1998 december 11 and 12 using the red arm of the double - armed spectrograph isis ( carter et al .",
    "1994 ) , and a tektronics ccd detector of @xmath45 pixels , at the cassegrain focus of the 4.2  m william herschel telescope ( wht ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( la palma , spain ) .",

    "the effective spectral resolution achieved was 0.7  (@xmath46  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the angular scale was @xmath37  pixel@xmath1 .    in order to obtain the spectrum of the hh  30 jet ,",
    "the @xmath47 long slit was centered on the hh  30 star with a p.a .",
    "of @xmath48 .",
    "one exposure of 600 s of the hh  30 jet was obtained on 1998 december 12 , with a slit width of @xmath49 .",
    "four exposures of 1800 s each , with a total integration time of 2  h , were obtained on 1998 december 11 through hh  30-n .",
    "the slit was centered on the position of knot ne ( lpez et al .",
    "1996 ) , at a p.a . of @xmath48 , covering the emission from knots na to nh .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard procedures for the long - slit spectroscopy within the iraf package .",
    "the spectra were not flux - calibrated .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity as a function of position along the hh  30 jet and hh  30-n has been obtained by fitting multiple gaussians to the observed [ sii ] 6717 , 6731    and h@xmath19 emission line profiles , using the splot task of iraf .",
    "the gaussian profiles are described in terms of line center , which is transformed into heliocentric velocity , and line width , given as the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "in figure [ figcromo ] we show the [ sii ] image of the overall region , about @xmath50 in size , corresponding to the first epoch .",
    "the field includes the hh  30 source , near the southern edge of the image , which appears at the vertex of a cone of nebulosity that apparently extends along several tens of arcsec . the hh  30 jet crosses the image from southwest to northeast , and its wiggling as it propagates away from its exciting source is clearly visible .",
    "the image also includes the hh  30-n knots , near the northern edge of the image , which have been proposed to also belong to the hh  30 jet ( lpez et al .  1995 ) .",
    "unfortunately only the very first knots of the hh  30 counterjet fall inside the field .",
    "the bright stars hl and xz tau and their associated jets are also included in the observed field .",
    "a large fraction of the hl tau counterjet is visible in the southwestern part of the image , while the hh  266 object , proposed to be also associated with hl tau ( lpez et al .",
    "1995 ) falls near the northeastern corner of the image . the young stellar object lkh@xmath19  358 is also visible near the western edge of the image .",
    "faint knots , corresponding to the emission - line knots k1-k3 identified by mundt et al .",
    "( 1988 ) ( see their fig .  1 ) , can be seen in our images @xmath51 to the southeast of xz tau .",
    "additional knots , extending @xmath52 to the east of k1-k3 can also be seen in our images .",
    "these knots are connected by diffuse emission that extends further away , forming an apparent `` ring '' with a radius of @xmath14 , surrounding the darker region observed towards the center of the frame .",
    "we detected these knots and the diffuse emission in our images at the two epochs , but we did not find evidence for systematic proper motions .",
    "thus , this apparent ring probably arises as a result of an increase in extinction towards the center of the field , because of a foreground clump .",
    "it is interesting to note that a molecular ring , centered near xz tau , has been mapped in @xmath53co by welch et al .",
    "the dark region at the center of our image coincides with the eastern side of the molecular ring , suggesting that this dark region corresponds to the increase of extinction because of this foreground molecular cloud , with the diffuse optical emission probably originating at the edges of this molecular structure .",
    "hl  tau falls close to the western side of the molecular ring and , as noted by welch et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the large arc of scattered light that appears to pass through hl  tau , apparently corresponds to the western side of the molecular structure .        in table [ tabpm ] and figure [ fignot99 ] we give the proper motion results obtained for the hh  30 jet using the procedures described in  [ smpm ] .",
    "the proper motion velocity has been calculated assuming a distance of 140  pc . in the proper motion calculations ,",
    "the @xmath32 axis is at a position angle of @xmath54 , in the approximate direction of the jet .",
    "we have set the zero point of our coordinate system on the bright knot closest to the hh 30 star , labeled as a0 .",
    "we identified this knot with the knot 95 - 01n of the _ hst _ image of burrows et al .",
    "these authors estimate from a fit of the _ hst _ image to a flared disk using scattered - light models that the position of the exciting source is shifted from 95 - 01n , corresponding to a position @xmath55 .",
    "the nomenclature used for the knots maintains the single letter names used by mundt et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and lpez et al .",
    "however , the number after the letter indicates only an order of distance from the hh  30 star and no attempt has been made to be consistent with previous observations .",
    "thus , for instance , the group of knots b is roughly at the same distance from the hh  30 source in the images of mundt et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , lpez et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and in this paper ; however , knots b1 , b2 , and b3 identified in the present images do not have a clear correspondence with knots b1 and b2 of mundt et al .",
    "( 1990 ) ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "the proper motion velocities obtained along the hh  30 jet range from @xmath56 to @xmath57  km  s@xmath1 , in a direction close to the jet axis . near the source the velocities appear to be higher , with velocities of @xmath58 to @xmath57  km  s@xmath1 for knots a to d ( corresponding to distances from @xmath59 to @xmath60 from the source ; first panel of fig .   [ fignot99 ] ) , except for the edges of the b condensation ( knots b1 and b3 ) , where the velocities are lower ( @xmath61  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the velocity of the central knot ( b2 ) is similar to the other knots in the a ",
    "the velocity decreases beyond knot e1 ( at @xmath62 , with a velocity of @xmath58  km  s@xmath1 ) , reaching values of @xmath61  km  s@xmath1 for knots e2 to e4 ( from @xmath63 to @xmath64 ) , and @xmath56  km  s@xmath1 for knots g ( at @xmath65 ) .",
    "finally , the velocity increases slightly up to @xmath61  km  s@xmath1 for knots h to i ( from @xmath66 to @xmath67 ) . it should be noted that up to knot e3 , the direction of the velocity is in general quite close to the jet axis ( @xmath68 ) , while beyond knot e3 some of the knots present a significant velocity component westwards , perpendicularly to the jet axis ( @xmath69@xmath70 ) , so that the decrease in velocity is still more noticeable for the velocity component along the jet axis .    we have only been able to measure the proper motions of two knots of the counterjet . for knot z2 ( at @xmath71 from the source ) the velocity is @xmath11  km  s@xmath1 , similar to that of knot a2 in the jet .",
    "however we measured a significantly lower velocity , of @xmath72  km  s@xmath1 , for knot z1 ( at @xmath73 ) .",
    "we think that this abnormally low value of the velocity , as compared with the values measured for the remaining knots of the jet and the counterjet , is likely caused by contamination by scattered light and might not represent a measure of a true acceleration in the counterjet .",
    "the proper motions measured for the hh  30-n knots are on the average aligned with the direction of the hh  30 jet .",
    "however , the values obtained both for the velocity and the position angle , show a dispersion considerably larger than in the knots of the hh  30 jet ( see last panel in fig .  [ fignot99 ] and table [ tabpm ] ) .",
    "this larger dispersion in the measured values can be due to the fact that in the hh  30-n knots the emission is fainter than in the hh  30 jet , but could also be a consequence of the interaction between the head of the jet and its surroundings .",
    "the global proper motion velocity of the hh  30-n structure is @xmath74  km  s@xmath1 with @xmath75 , similar to the direction of the hh  30 jet , thus supporting the hypothesis that this group of knots corresponds to the head of the hh  30 jet ( lpez et al .",
    "the velocity values for individual knots range from @xmath76 to @xmath57  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the largest velocity is measured for knot nc , but most of the knots have velocity values of @xmath76  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "it should be noted that nf , that was identified as a hh knot in previous works , appears very circular and compact in our higher quality images presented here ( see fig .",
    "[ fignot99 ] ) ; since the proper motion is compatible with zero ( @xmath77  km  s@xmath1 ) , we conclude that it is most probably a field star .",
    "lpez et al .",
    "( 1996 ) measure proper motions for knots c / d and e of the hh  30 jet .",
    "the directions of the proper motions we measured are roughly consistent with those derived by lpez et al .",
    "for the hh  30 jet we obtained a similar velocity for knot e. for knot c / d where lpez et al .",
    "( 1996 ) note that they obtain an absurdly large velocity of @xmath78  km  s@xmath1 , we now obtain a more reasonable value of @xmath57  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "mundt et al .  ( 1990 ) report a still lower proper motion velocity of @xmath61  km  s@xmath1 for knot c ( the only knot for which they measure the proper motion ) , but since they use images of two epochs obtained through different filters , we think that our value is more reliable .",
    "burrows et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , from _ hst _ observations , measure proper motion velocities of @xmath79  km  s@xmath1 in the inner @xmath80 of the jet and velocities of @xmath11  km  s@xmath1 for distances of @xmath81 in the counterjet .",
    "these values are roughly in agreement with the velocities we measured for knots a2 , a3 in the jet and z2 in the counterjet .",
    "regarding hh  30-n , the only previous available proper motion measurements are those of lpez et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for knots",
    "nd , ne , and nf . our results confirm that the direction of the proper motion velocities of hh  30-n is consistent with hh  30-n belonging to the hh  30 jet , thus supporting the claim of lpez et al .",
    "however , we obtained significantly lower values for the velocities .",
    "in particular , we conclude that knot nf is a field star ( see discussion above ) .",
    "since the knots of hh  30-n are weak and diffuse , we attribute these discrepancies to the lower sensitivity and angular resolution of the images used by lpez et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .    in order to better illustrate the comparison with previous observations of the positions and proper motions of the hh  30 jet knots , we plotted in figure [ figcpm ] their positions as a function of time .",

    "the five vertical lines of each panel mark the epoch of different observations and the circles indicate the position of the knots .",

    "the two vertical lines labeled `` 98 '' and `` 99 '' correspond to the present observations with the not telescope .",
    "the dotted lines indicate the proper motions of the knots , as measured from the 1998 and 1999 observations , taken from table  [ tabpm ] .",
    "the shaded area along the proper motion line of knot 99-c indicates the formal uncertainty of the proper motion measurement for this knot , as it propagates with time .",
    "the uncertainties for other knots are similar to this case , shown here as an example .",
    "we have not included the data of the observations described in lpez et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , observed in 1995 february since they are of much lower quality .",
    "the extrapolation of the proper motions measured from our not 1998 - 1999 data to the epoch of the previous observations intersects the vertical lines at points that , in general , are in agreement with the positions of observed knots .",
    "however , this correspondence is better for knots located farther away from the exciting source , while for knots closer to the source the correspondence is more complex . as the right panel of figure [ figcpm ] illustrates , a backward extrapolation of our proper motion measurements for knots e1-e4 and g1-g2 ( at distances of @xmath51 to @xmath82 from the source ) provides a good agreement with the positions of the knots e and g actually observed in both the 1987 and 1993 images .",
    "the extrapolated position of knot 99-d1 falls very close to the position of knot 95 - 14n in the _ hst _ image , while the extrapolated position of knot 99-d2 falls outside the region where the _ hst _ observations are sensitive enough to detect the jet emission . in the 1993 image , the extrapolation of the proper motions of knots",
    "99-d1 and 99-d2 falls in a region where it is difficult to separate the emission into several knots , and it is designated as 93-d1 , while the d2 knot in the 1993 image would probably be displaced too far away ( and , thus , too faint ) in the 1998 - 1999 images to be detected .",
    "interestingly , our proper motion extrapolation suggests that knots d ( at @xmath83 from the source ) in the 1998 - 1999 images arise from knot c ( at @xmath84 from the source ) in the 1987 image , while knots d in that image would have faded away in our 1998 - 1999 images .",
    "knot c in our 1998 - 99 images appears to correspond to knot 93-c , and perhaps to knot 95 - 13n . for knots b1b3 in the 1998 - 1999 images ,",
    "the extrapolation suggests a correspondence with knots 11n and 12n in the 1995 image , and knots b1 and b2 in the 1987 image . as we noted previously , we derived abnormally low values for the proper motions of knots 99-b1 and 99-b3 ; an extrapolation of their positions using the proper motion value obtained for b2 would result in a one - to - one correspondence between knots 99-b1 , 99-b2 and 99-b3 with knots 95 - 10n , 95 - 11n , and 95 - 12n , respectively .",
    "also , within current uncertainties , knot 87-b2 could correspond either to the extrapolation of knot 99-c or knot 99-b3 .    for knots within @xmath20 from the source , the _ hst _ image provides much more detail than our ground based 1998 - 99 images , thus making less useful the backward extrapolation of the not proper motions , since each 98 and 99 knot corresponds to more than one 95 knot .",
    "however , from the inspection of figure [ figcpm ] , and using the proper motions reported in burrows et al .",

    "leads its extrapolated position to coincide with that of knot 99-a2 , for which we obtained the same value of the proper motion velocity .",
    "knot 99-a1 , which only appears in our 1999 not image , had probably still not emerged at the epoch of the _ hst _ observations .",

    "globally , it seems that near the source the interaction of the knots with the medium is stronger , and fading out is more important , and thus the changes in intensity and shape of structure makes more difficult the cross - identifications of knots in different epochs .",
    "since close to the hh  30 star the [ sii ] emission of the jet is stronger than the h@xmath19 emission , being also less contaminated by the emission of the star , the heliocentric radial velocities along the hh  30 jet have been derived from the [ sii ] line profiles .",

    "proper motion measurements are more difficult for the knots of the counterjet because many of them are weak and appear split into several subcondensations ; in fact , our results are the first determination of proper motions in the hl  tau counterjet .",

    "however , the uncertainty in the p.a . of the proper motion is not small enough to discard that another object nearby to hl tau ( such as xz tau or even the hh  30 star ) was the driving source for hh 266 .",

    "we attribute this discrepancy to the fact that mundt et al .",

    "as can be seen in the table , the proper motions obtained in this way are in better agreement with our not 1998 - 1999 measurements .    since the radial velocity of the hl tau jet with respect to the ambient cloud is @xmath124 km s@xmath1 ( mundt et al .",
    "1990 ) , and proper motions are @xmath74 km s@xmath1 , we infer that the total velocity of the hl tau jet is @xmath125 km s@xmath1 , being the angle of the jet with respect to the plane of the sky of @xmath126 ( towards the observer ) .    the radial velocity of the counterjet measured by mundt et al .",

    "as noted before , the hh  30 jet presents a wiggling morphology that is particularly evident in the group of knots e1e4 ( see fig.[fignot99]b ) . if the wiggling was produced as the result of a true helical trajectory of the knots as they move away from the exciting source ( e.g. , by a deflection , as the jet propagates , because of the encounter with a set of high density clumps ) , one would expect to see changes in the direction of their proper motions , following a velocity pattern tangent to the helical trajectory ( e.g. , one would expect knot e1 to move to the right of the jet axis , while knots e2 and e3 to move to the left ) . despite the uncertainties in the @xmath35 component of the velocities , we do not see evidence for such a systematic pattern ; rather , the direction of the proper motion vectors appears to be quite close to that of the axis of the jet .",
    "furthermore , when comparing , for example , the e1e4 structure in our images with the previous images of mundt et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and lpez et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , a displacement can be seen of the whole knot structure , keeping the same morphology , while a change in this morphology would be expected if the knots were following an helical trajectory .",
    "this is further illustrated in figure [ figcpm ] , where it can be seen that the group of knots e1e4 moves essentially as a whole from one epoch to another , maintaining the same relative distance between knots .",
    "thus , we conclude that the motion of the knots is essentially ballistic and that the observed wiggling of the jet structure is most likely produced by variations in the direction of the ejection at the origin of the jet .",
    "we will test the possibility that the observed wiggling in the hh  30 jet results mainly from the orbital motion of the jet source around a binary companion . following the formulation given by masciadri & raga ( 2002 )",
    ", we will consider a ballistic jet ( i.e. , a jet where the fluid parcels preserve the velocity with which they are ejected ) from a star in a circular orbit , and we will further assume that the ejection velocity ( measured in a frame moving with the outflow source ) is time independent and parallel to the orbital axis .    let @xmath131 be the mass of the jet source , @xmath132 the mass of the companion , and @xmath133 the total mass of the system .",

    "the @xmath143 axis coincides with the orbital axis , at an angle @xmath91 with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "the ejection velocity of the jet will have a component in the orbital plane due to the orbital motion , @xmath144 , and a component perpendicular to this plane , @xmath145 , assumed to be constant . in this coordinate system the shape of the jet",

    "an alternative possibility is that the observed wiggling of the hh  30 jet is due to precession of the ejection axis of the jet , being driven by tidal interactions between the disk from which the jet originates and a companion star in a non coplanar orbit .",

    "unlike the case of orbital motion , in the case of precession , the observables do not tightly constrain the orbital parameters , and a number of additional assumptions are required to infer their values . since it is expected that the size of the disk is truncated by tidal interaction with the companion star in such a way that @xmath210 ( lin & papaloizou 1993 ; artymowicz & lubow 1994 ; larwood et al .  1996 ; terquem et al .",

    "we conclude that both the orbital motion and the precession models are feasible . in the first case , the orbital period would be 53 yr , the expected angular separation would be @xmath194@xmath184 ( 918 au ) , and the jet source is expected to be the secondary , while the mass of the primary is expected to fall in the range 0.251  @xmath5 . in the case of precession , in order to fulfill the observational constraints , the jet source should be the primary , with a mass in the range @xmath61  @xmath5 , resulting in much smaller values for the derived parameters : the orbital period is expected to be less than @xmath227 yr , the mass of the companion less than a few times @xmath228 , and the angular separation @xmath229 ( @xmath7 au ) .    we want to emphasize that both scenarios are consistent with the current observational data , and that both imply that the exciting source of the hh  30 jet should be a close binary ( separation @xmath230 ) .",
    "we take the very good agreement between the predicted and observed wiggling of the hh  30 jet as a strong ( although indirect ) evidence for the existence of such a binary system .",
    "a direct evidence would require to resolve the hh  30 exciting source with an angular resolution better than @xmath231 in the case of orbital motions and better than @xmath232 in the case that the wiggling is originated by precession .",
    "given the strong extinction towards the source and the high angular resolution required , observations at centimeter , millimeter , or submillimeter wavelengths will be necessary . in the first scenario ,",
    "the required angular resolution can be currently achieved with the vla although , unfortunately , the source appears to be weak at centimeter wavelengths , and has not been detected yet ( carrasco - gonzlez et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the precession scenario ,",
    "the angular resolution required is near the limits of the expected capabilities of alma .    in both scenarios",
    "the range of values inferred for the mass of the system is consistent with the estimate for the stellar mass of @xmath233 obtained from iram plateau de bure @xmath53co observations of the disk ( pety et al .",
    "we also note that stapelfeldt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find variability in the asymmetry of the disk suggesting a characteristic time scale of 3 yr or less , which is of the order of the values of the orbital period derived in the precession scenario .",
    "this coincidence should be expected if the variability of the illumination pattern were produced by an eclipsing binary system with this orbital period .",
    "the two proposed scenarios could be discriminated by taking into account that in the first case mirror symmetry between the jet and counterjet is expected , while in the second case point symmetry is expected to be found .",
    "unfortunately , our images do not cover the counterjet and we can not discriminate between both possibilities .",
    "we expect that future observations will allow us to discriminate between the two scenarios .",
    "we also note that , in both scenarios , the expected separation between the two components of the binary system is @xmath9 au , a value much smaller than the radius of the disk nearly perpendicular to the hh  30 jet observed with the _ hst _ ( burrows et al .",
    "1996 , stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1999 ) , which is @xmath11 au .",
    "given that the radius of any circumstellar disk associated with the jet source should be smaller than the binary separation , this implies that the _ hst _ disk should be a circumbinary disk and not a circumstellar disk .",
    "also , since the scale of the jet collimating mechanism should be much smaller than that of the mechanism that drives the jet wiggling , which is of the order of the binary separation ( @xmath9 au ) , we conclude that the @xmath0250 au disk observed with the _ hst _ is unlikely to have a relevant role in the jet collimation , contrary to what has been thought up to now .",
    "these results suggest that the search for the true collimating agent of the hh  30 jet ( likely a circumstellar disk associated with the jet source ) should be done at very small angular scales , @xmath10 ( @xmath9 au ) .      as a general trend",
    ", we observe that the direction of the proper motions measured for the knots of the hh  30 jet approximately coincides with that of the geometrical axis of the jet ( see fig .",
    "[ fignot99 ] and table [ tabpm ] ) .",
    "there is , however , some indication of a systematic velocity component perpendicular to the axis of the jet , so that the resulting proper motion velocities deviate to the right of the jet axis ( i.e. , the velocities are orientated at a p.a .",
    "that , in general , is smaller than that of the jet axis , whose p.a . is @xmath234 ) .",
    "the presence of this velocity component perpendicular to the jet axis is in agreement with the suggestion of lpez et al .",
    "( 1995 ) that the observed `` axial rotation '' effect in the hh  30 jet ( i.e. , the direction of the axis of the jet and counterjet curves westward as one moves away from the exciting source ) is a consequence of the relative motion between the source and the environment . such a scenario has been modeled in detail by cant & raga ( 1995 ) .",
    "the proximity of the powerful l1551-irs5 molecular outflow , to the southeast of the hh  30 jet , could also contribute to the velocity component perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "the wiggling - model fit obtained for the jet at distances smaller than @xmath235 ( see   [ swiggling ] ) is also essentially valid for larger scales . in figures [ figcromo ] and [ figwiggle]b",
    "we show the resulting structure of the jet up to distances of @xmath236 . in this fit",
    "we introduced a slight change of @xmath237 in the p.a .",
    ", at a distance of @xmath238 from the source , in order to reproduce the bending of the jet ( see discussion above ) .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , in this way the overall structure of the jet is reproduced quite well , including the width of the jet up to the distance of hh  30-n .",
    "we take this as an additional proof that the hh  30-n knots do belong to the hh  30 jet ( and that hh 266 does not belong to the hh  30 jet ) . also , we take this good agreement as additional evidence for the presence of a binary system in the exciting source of the hh  30 jet .",
    "we note that the detailed oscillations of the jet are not well reproduced for distances higher than @xmath235",
    ". this can be due to slight variations in the ejection velocity ( in fact , proper motions are not constant ) that would result in increasingly larger deviations of the periodic pattern as the distance from the source increases .",
    "in fact , a change in the radial velocity is observed at a distance of @xmath82 from the source , coinciding with the @xmath239 of the jet .    finally , we point out that if one wants to explain the knot / inter - knot pattern of the hh 30 jet as the result of source variability with a multiple mode model ( as derived by raga & noriega - crespo 1998 for the hh  34 jet ) , we would need at least four modes",
    ". one of these modes would have a @xmath240  yr period , as derived by burrows et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the _ hst _ knots 0204n .",
    "we would then need a second @xmath24140 yr period to explain the separation between features such as the knot that corresponds to the _ hst _ knots 06 + 07n and the condensation composed by the _",
    "hst _ knots 0204n ( see fig .   [ figcpm ] ) .",
    "a similar period is found from the velocities and separation between knots b and c , and knots e1 and e2 ( see figs .",
    "[ fignot99 ] and [ figcpm ] ) . a third , @xmath242 yr period is necessary to produce the separations between knots b / c , e , g and h. finally , in order to produce the na - nh knot structure ( see figs .   [ figcromo ] and [ fignot99 ] )",
    ", one would need a fourth source variability mode .",
    "the dynamical timescale @xmath243 of the na ",
    "nh knots indicates the order of magnitude of the period of this fourth mode .",
    "even though there is little doubt that the _ hst _ knot spacing pattern is generated very close to the outflow source ( see burrows et al .",
    "1996 ) , it is clearly possible that the larger scale knot patterns could originate at larger distances from the source ( e.  g. , through instabilities developed along the jet beam ) . the question of whether or not these larger scale knot patterns are also generated as a consequence of source variability should be settled in the future through high angular resolution monitoring of the hh  30 jet during the following @xmath244 years .",
    "using the not we obtained [ s  ii ] ccd frames at two epochs with a time span of one year of the region enclosing hh 30 , hh 30-n , hh 266 , as well as hl / xz tau .",
    "we also obtained high - resolution optical spectroscopy of the hh 30 jet ( including hh 30-n ) using the wht .",
    "the main conclusions from the analysis of our results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we measured proper motions in the hh 30 jet , with velocities ranging from @xmath56 to @xmath57 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "we found the highest values of the velocity ( 200300 km  s@xmath1 ) near the driving source ( @xmath245 au ) , decreasing to @xmath61 km  s@xmath1 at distances of @xmath246 au .",
    "although the jet shows a wiggling morphology , the proper motions of the jet knots are roughly parallel to the jet axis , with no signs of a pattern of changes in the direction as would be expected for a true helical motion of the knots .",
    "this suggests that the motion of the knots is essentially ballistic and that the observed wiggling is most likely produced by variations in the direction of the velocity at the origin of the jet .",
    "nevertheless , there is a small but systematic drift of the velocities westwards , which could be due to the effect of a side wind .",
    "we have been able to measure reliable proper motions only for one of the knots of the counterjet , obtaining a velocity of @xmath11 km  s@xmath1 , which is similar to the velocities measured in the jet at similar distances .",
    "the proper motions measured for the hh 30-n knots are , on the average , aligned with the direction of the hh 30 jet , thus supporting the hypothesis that this group of knots corresponds to the head of the hh  30 jet ( lpez et al .",
    "1996 ) . however , the values obtained for both magnitude and position angle of the velocity show a dispersion considerably larger than in the hh 30 jet , which could be a consequence of the interaction between the head of the jet and its surroundings .",
    "+ knot nf , which was previously identified as a hh knot , appears very circular and compact in our higher quality images , and with a proper motion compatible with being static .",
    "we thus conclude that it is most probably a field star .",
    "the values we obtained for the proper motions along the hh 30 jet are similar to those derived from _ hst _ data by burrows et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the inner ( @xmath247 ) region of the jet .",
    "we found a good agreement between the direction of our proper motions and that obtained by lpez et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , although we found discrepancies with the values of the velocity derived by these authors ( and by mundt et al .  1990 ) that we attribute to the poorer quality of their data .",
    "in general , we found a pretty good correspondence between the extrapolation back in time of our proper motion estimates for the hh 30 knots and the positions of the knots identified in previous observations .",
    "this result indicates that most of the knots probably consist of persisting outflowing structures .",
    "however , in some parts of the jet , particularly near the source ( @xmath248 ) , where the interaction of the jet with the medium appears to be stronger and fading is more noticeable than at larger distances , the knot structure shows indications for an additional static pattern , that could arise from the interaction with the ambient cloud . 7 .",
    "our spectroscopic observations show that the radial velocity of the jet is similar to the systemic velocity of the cloud . from the ratio of the radial to proper motion velocities we inferred that the jet lies essentially in the plane of the sky ( @xmath249 ) for distances to the source @xmath250 . for distances to the source @xmath251 the jet is redshifted with respect to the ambient cloud , with an inclination angle with respect to the plane of the sky @xmath252 . for the hh 30-n structure ,",
    "the radial velocity is blueshifted with respect to the ambient cloud , with an inclination angle with respect to the plane of the sky @xmath253 , suggesting a bending of the direction of the jet propagation , as previously proposed by raga et al .",
    "we estimated the electron density of the hh 30 jet knots up to @xmath108 from the source , and in hh 30-n , covering a region much more extended than in previous studies .",
    "the density in the hh 30 jet decreases with distance to the source , remaining below @xmath254  @xmath110 for distances @xmath117-@xmath108 .",
    "the density increases to @xmath255  @xmath110 in hh 30-n , suggesting an interaction of the jet with an ambient medium of locally enhanced density .",
    "our images reveal a clear wiggling of the hh 30 jet knots , with a spatial periodicity of @xmath256 ( @xmath167 au ) .",
    "the width of the jet beam increases with distance to the source , with a half - opening angle in the plane of the sky of @xmath257 .",
    "we found that the wiggling structure of the hh 30 can be accounted for either by the orbital motion of the jet source or by the precession of the jet axis .",
    "+ in the first case the orbital period of the binary system would be 53 yr , the expected angular separation of the two components would be @xmath194@xmath184 ( 918 au ) , and the jet source is expected to be the secondary , while the mass of the primary is expected to fall in the range 0.251  @xmath5 . in the case of precession",
    "the jet source should be the primary , with a mass in the range @xmath61  @xmath5 .",
    "the orbital period should be less than 1 yr , the mass of the companion less than a few times @xmath8 , and the angular separation @xmath229 ( @xmath7 au ) .",
    "therefore , it is feasible that the secondary is a substellar object , or even a giant exoplanet .",
    "we take the very good agreement between the predicted and observed wiggling of the hh  30 jet as a strong ( although indirect ) evidence for the existence of a binary system .",
    "the angular separation between the two components is very small ( @xmath258 in the case of orbital motion and @xmath259 in the case of precession ) , and would require the use of vla or alma to resolve the system .",
    "+ in either case , the separation between the two components of the binary is well below the size ( @xmath260 au ) of the observed disk perpendicular to the jet , indicating that this disk should be a circumbinary disk instead of a circumstellar disk , contrary to what has been thought up to now .",
    "this leaves unclear the role of the observed disk in the jet collimation , suggesting that the search for a circumstellar disk ( likely the true collimating agent of the hh  30 jet ) should be carried out at very small scales ( @xmath230 ) .",
    "our fit of the observed knot structure of the jet allowed us to refine the value of the position angle of the axis of the jet , obtaining a value of @xmath261 . in fitting the large scale structure ( up to @xmath262 )",
    "we need to introduce a change in the direction of the jet , @xmath239 at a distance @xmath263 .",
    "this change in the direction occurs roughly at the same position where there is a change in the radial velocities observed , suggesting a change in the inclination angle with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "we obtained a more accurate estimate of the proper motions of the hl tau jet , which are of the order of @xmath74 km  s@xmath1 , a value significantly lower than previous estimates . from our proper motions and using the radial velocity measurements of mundt et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , we estimated that the inclination angle of the hl tau jet with respect to the plane of the sky is @xmath264 .",
