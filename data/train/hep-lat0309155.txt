    "pilot studies of the scattering phase shift were carried out for the @xmath1=2 s - wave two - pion system in ref .",
    "these studies were made only at one lattice spacing employing the quenched approximation . in this report , we present a calculation including two flavors of dynamical quarks , so that we can get rid of errors from unitarity violation , at three different lattice spacings to carry out extrapolation to the continuum limit .",
    "our study is based on the finite volume method of lscher formulated for the center of mass ( cm ) frame  @xcite , and its extension to the laboratory frame by rummukainen and gottlieb  @xcite .",
    "while the inclusion of the lab frame adds little extra computational cost , the use of the lab frame allows significantly more dense sampling of the energy states .",
    "we use the full qcd configurations  @xcite previously generated with an rg - improved gauge action and a mean - field improved clover quark action at three gauge couplings @xmath2 and @xmath3 , corresponding to @xmath4 and @xmath5 gev , on @xmath6 and @xmath7 lattices .",
    "the physical volumes are about @xmath8 fm .",
    "four hopping parameters corresponding to @xmath9 and @xmath10 gev are taken at each @xmath11 for chiral extrapolation .",
    "the numbers of the configurations vary from 380 to 720 .",
    "on a finite volume of @xmath12 the interaction between two pions shifts the two - pion energy @xmath13 . in the cm frame",
    ", writing @xmath14 with @xmath15 ( @xmath16 being non - integer ) , the phase shift @xmath17 is given by the relation @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 being integer vectors .    in the laboratory frame ,",
    "the two - pion energy @xmath21 and the sum of the two pion momenta @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 .",
    "the phase shift is now @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 . here",

    "[ fig : diag],title=\"fig : \" ]    the pion four - point function behaves as a sum of exponentials due to the presence of a number of states having the same quantum numbers . to resolve the energy eigenvalues ,",
    "we construct in each frame the pion four - point function matrix @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the source point and @xmath35 is the two - pion operator with momenta @xmath36 that depends on the state @xmath37 .",

    "@xmath47 or @xmath48 matrices are diagonalized and the phase shift is determined for the energies of the ground ( @xmath49 ) and the first excited ( @xmath50 ) states .    [ .40 ] ( top panels ) and @xmath3 ( bottom panels ) .",

    "for the ground state , @xmath56 so that the diagonalization is unnecessary . for the @xmath50 state , however , the ratio shows an exponential fall - off only after diagonalization : @xmath57 blows up at large @xmath58 .",
    "we apply an exponential fit to @xmath59 .",
    "the energy eigenvalues for the @xmath49 and 1 states change very little even if we adopt the cut - off @xmath60 instead of 3 and 4 .",

    "figure  [ fig : amp ] shows the scattering amplitude at @xmath65 and @xmath3 for the lightest and heaviest pion masses .",
    "the cm@xmath66 refers to the amplitude obtained from the @xmath37-th state in the cm frame , and the l1@xmath66 and l2@xmath66 to those in the lab frames . note that we have three points between the two cm data , showing the improvement of the momentum sampling .",
