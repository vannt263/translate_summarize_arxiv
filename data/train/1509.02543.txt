    "it is well understood that stars acquire most of their material through an accretion disk that is fed , at least at early times , by a surrounding envelope .",

    ", the accretion rates increase by factors of @xmath11 or more relative to the quiescent periods , reaching rates as high as @xmath12  m@xmath3  yr@xmath10 .",
    "this high state can last for @xmath13100 years and deposit a significant amount of disk material ( @xmath130.01m@xmath14 ) onto the young star in a short period .",
    "the cause of these outbursts is not well understood .",
    "different mechanisms have been proposed as possible origin for the outburst @xcite : 1 ) thermal instability @xcite , 2 ) coupling of gravitational and magnetorotational instabilities @xcite , 3 ) disk fragmentation @xcite , and 4 ) tidal interactions between the disk and either planets @xcite or stellar companions @xcite .",
    "connecting infrared studies which probe inside radii of 1 - 10au to the main mass reservoirs in the outer disk and/or envelope is particularly important if a full understanding of the phenomenon is to be achieved .",
    "for instance , it remains unclear whether the reservoir of material feeding the enhanced accretion rate is distributed in a circumstellar disk , in a larger envelope , or both .",
    "the only way to accurately recover the surface density distribution of the gas and dust around fu  ori objects is via resolved imaging of the disk at , preferably multiple , ( sub)millimeter wavelengths and/or transitions where the emission is most likely optically thin .    if the disk is small , and if there is no reservoir of material from which to replenish it , if it continues to accrete at @xmath12m@xmath15yr@xmath10 , the disk may be quickly dying . if the disk is indeed more massive and/or larger than previous submillimeter observations indicate , it is then a counterpart to the more massive disks seen in nearer star forming regions and we are simply seeing one outburst of potentially many",
    "clearly , resolving the source and determining the mass is key .",
    "despite being the prototype of the fu  ori class and one of the nearest such objects , at a distance of 450pc @xcite , little is known about the global properties of the accretion disk surrounding fu ori itself .",
    "the estimated age of the system is @xmath132  myr @xcite .",
    "early interferometric studies at 1.3  mm by @xcite found an unresolved ( at @xmath133.5resolution , or @xmath131500  au ) disk with @xmath16co(2 - 1 ) emission spanning 8.1 - 13.3  km  s@xmath10 with a total integrated intensity of 1.4jy .",
    "studies with the jcmt by @xcite show an unresolved continuum source ( @xmath175 in diameter ) and a flux of 66 and 400 mjy at 850 and 450@xmath18 m , respectively .",
    "these results suggest there is no envelope bigger than 1500  au around the source .",
    "significant progress has been made towards understanding the inner disk of fu ori objects in general and fu ori specifically ( see papers by e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the region of rapid accretion for fu ori itself has been shown to be occurring over a radius of @xmath131au , or 0.005 , in diameter .",
    "given the size of the region involved , thermal instability alone can not explain the outburst and appeals to other outbursts mechanisms must be made .",
    "fu  ori was discovered to be a binary system by @xcite , with the newly discovered binary component ( fu  ori  south , or fu  ori  s hereafter ) located 0.5to the south of the brighter principal component , fu  ori .",
    "recent studies indicate fu  ori  s is actually the more massive star in the system ( @xmath131.2m@xmath14 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , heavily embedded in obscuring material @xcite .",

    "6a / b * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , triggering discussion on whether the rapidly accreting fu  ori phenomenon could be caused by close - companion interaction .",
    "however , at least in the case of fu  ori itself , this hypothesis remains inconclusive ( e.g. see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggest an upper limit for the disk mass at 0.02m@xmath14 .",
    "there are a variety of ways to constraint the dust , gas and total mass of the disk , all of which involve obtaining resolved imaging to determine the optically thick contribution and model fits .",
    "below we present new observations of fu ori with sufficient resolution to constrain the masses of disks around fu ori",
    "fu ori band 7 observations were acquired on december 2@xmath19 2012 using 24 antennas .",
    "the dataset provides baselines from 15 to 381 meters . during the observations the precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere was stable between 1.3 and 1.7  mm with clear sky conditions , resulting in median system temperature of 190  k.",
    "the alma correlator was configured in the frequency division mode ( fdm ) to provide 468.75  mhz bandwidth in each of four different spectral windows at 122  khz ( @xmath130.1  km  s@xmath10 ) resolution per channel .",
    "three spectral windows were positioned to target the @xmath6co  @xmath20 , hcn  @xmath21 and hco@xmath22  @xmath21 transitions at 345.79599 , 354.50547 and 356.73424  ghz , respectively .",
    "the fourth spectral window was positioned in a region devoid of line emission for detecting the continuum dust emission ( centered at 345.78359  ghz ) .",
    "callisto was observed as flux calibrator , while the quasars j0522 - 364 and j0532 + 075 were observed for bandpass and phase calibration respectively ( j0532 + 075 is located 3.5  degrees away from the science target ) .",
    "observations of the phase calibrator were alternated with the science target every 5 minutes to calibrate the time - dependent variations of the complex gains .",
    "the total time spent on - source was 16.9 minutes .",
    "a secondary phase calibrator , j053056 + 13322 , was also observed regularly ( located 5.7  degrees away ) .",

    "* ) in a standard fashion , which included offline water vapor radiometer ( wvr ) calibration , system temperature correction , as well as bandpass , phase and amplitude calibrations .",
    "after flagging for problematic antennas , a total of 21 antennas were used for imaging .",
    "the fluxes derived for j0522 - 364 , j0532 + 075 and j053056 + 133220 were 7.5 , 1.1 and 0.5  jy respectively . during cycle 0 ,",
    "the absolute flux calibration of the data is estimated to be accurate to within 10 to 15@xmath23 .",
    "imaging of the continuum and molecular emission lines was performed using the clean task in casa .",
    "using natural weighting resulted in a synthesized beam size of 0.63@xmath00.51@xmath1 at pa@xmath24  degrees .",
    "continuum subtraction in the visibility domain was performed prior to imaging of each molecular line .",
    "after cleaning the images , an rms noise level of 25.0  mjybeam@xmath10 per 0.22  km  s@xmath10 channel was reached ( in the @xmath6co  @xmath20 line ) .",
    "cleaning of the dust continuum was performed after combining the line - free channels from all four spectral windows ( adding to a total bandwidth of 1.759  ghz centered at 351.33  ghz ) , for which an rms of 0.64  mjybeam@xmath10 was obtained . after a single iteration of phase - only self - calibration the rms of the continuum image",
    "was reduced to 0.31  mjybeam@xmath10 .",
    "figure  [ fig-1 ] shows the alma band 7 continuum image of fu  ori after self - calibration .",
    "the continuum emission at 0.854  mm ( 351.33  ghz ) is detected at a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of @xmath13150 .",
    "the emission is resolved , with the peak roughly coinciding with the position of the northern binary component ( fu ori ) .",
    "we used the casa task imfit to fit the observed emission using a single component 2-d gaussian , but inspection of the residual image shows that a single - component fit fails to match data . using two unresolved sources provides a much better fit to the observed emission ( with residuals down to the image noise levels ) .",
    "the total fluxes of each component are 50.1@xmath25  mjy and 21.2@xmath26  mjy respectively .",
    "the parameters of the gaussian components determined using imfit are detailed in table  [ table-1 ] .",

    "the integrated intensity maps of the three molecules are strikingly different .",
    "@xmath6co is more extended compared to the continuum ( extending up 1  from fu  ori , and covering the two binary components ) , and peaks east - ward from fu  ori . on the other hand , hco@xmath7 peaks close to the position of the southern binary component ( fu  ori  s ) , whilst hcn  @xmath21 appears to peak closer to fu  ori .",
    "figure  [ fig-4 ] shows the @xmath6co channel maps towards fu  ori .",
    "there is significant cloud contamination in the central channels , making the interpretation of the @xmath6co spectrum difficult .",
    "the velocity of the channels with no @xmath6co emission ( 11.8  km  s@xmath10 ) is very similar to the velocity channels where strong @xmath6co(1 - 0 ) emission was previously detected with the nrao 11 m telescope @xcite .",
    "this suggests that unresolved emission and/or absorption from the larger orion molecular clouds contaminates the emission in the central channels of the alma spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , a velocity gradient can be perceived in the channel maps and in the first moment map of the @xmath6co ( figure  [ fig-5 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig-5 ] shows the position - velocity diagram taken in the east - west direction ( where the velocity gradient appears to be larger ) , which suggests there is gas in keplerian rotation around the system .",
    "we detect continuum emission towards both binary components , suggesting they both harbour circumstellar disks .",
    "the disks are unresolved at the @xmath130.6@xmath00.5@xmath1 resolution of our observations ( or 225  au at fu  ori s 450  pc distance ) , placing upper limits on the disk radial sizes . to be consistent with the gaussian fit",
    ", the disks must have radial sizes smaller than 0.1  ( 45  au ) . at the projected separation of the binary system ( 225  au ) , the disks radii",
    "are predicted to be truncated at 0.2 to 0.5 times the binary separation @xcite .",
    "the deconvolved disk sizes of 45  au coincide with 0.2 times the binary separation .",
    "our alma data rule out the presence of a large envelope around the two stars , since our observations would have detected any extended emission smaller than @xmath30  ( 3000  au ) in diameter .",
    "our observations also place limits on the presence of a possible circumbinary ring orbiting the system . assuming a 0.5  wide ring , starting at 1.5  ( given the minimal truncation radius for the projected binary orbit ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ring would need to have a dust mass smaller than @xmath31m@xmath3 to remain undetected by our observations ( at 3-@xmath32 , assuming a dust temperature of 20  k ) .",
    "this is similar to recent alma results from @xcite in which no circumbinary emission was detected in any of the 17 binary stars of their sample .    assuming a dust temperature of 50  k for the individual disks around fu  ori and fu  ori  s , a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 , and a 345  ghz dust opacity of 1.5  @xmath33g@xmath10",
    ", we can compute a coarse estimate of the disks total masses . under these assumptions ,",
    "the alma 854  @xmath18 m fluxes correspond to disk dust masses of @xmath2  m@xmath3 and @xmath4  m@xmath3 , for the north and south components respectively .",
    "the total mass of the combined disks is comparable to the mass estimated from unresolved observations @xcite .",
    "these mass estimates are , however , subject to the assumption that the dust emission is optically thin . for the disks to be optically thick ,",
    "the average disk dust temperature would have to be higher than 80  k. assuming a @xmath34 dependence for the disk temperature , an average t  @xmath35 80  k is reached if the temperature at 45  au is greater than 60  k. this is high for a typical t  tauri disk , but it corresponds roughly to the radiative equilibrium temperature for a source with a luminosity larger than about 4  l@xmath3 .",
    "this is perfectly feasible for fu  ori , where the outburst luminosity much larger than the photospheric luminosity .",
    "we conclude that the disks could be marginally optically thick , although higher resolution imaging would be required to accurately constrain this .",
    "according to @xcite the masses of fu  ori and fu  ori  s are 0.3  m@xmath3 , and 1.2  m@xmath3 respectively . assuming an effective temperature of 4000 - 6500  k and an optical extinction of a@xmath36=8 - 12 , @xcite estimate a minimum mass for fu  ori  s of 0.5  m@xmath3 .",
    "both studies agree that fu  ori  s is the most massive star in the system . in this scenario",
    "fu  ori  s would be the primary star in the system .",
    "unfortunately , our line data lacks the angular resolution to resolve the velocity gradients across each disk , which could be used to confirm these stellar masses .",
    "theoretical models predict that the circumprimary disks should be the most massive disks in the system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , recent submillimeter surveys of binary systems show no clear relationship between disk masses and stellar mass ratios @xcite . as noted by these authors , the predictions from these theoretical models only consider the initial conditions of the binary disks and do not take into account the dynamical evolution of the disks ( e.g. viscous accretion and other dissipative processes ) . assuming that both disks have the same average dust temperature",
    ", we find that in the fu  ori system the brightest and most massive disk orbits the less massive star .",
    "we note that this scenario may be different if the southern disk is cooler than the northern disk .",
    "for instance , if the southern disk has an average dust temperature of 20  k , its mass would be higher than the @xmath2  m@xmath3 dust mass derived for the northern disk .",
    "the denser gas tracer hco@xmath22  @xmath21 peaks in the position of the most massive star fu  ori  s , and is not detected in the direction of fu  ori . since hco@xmath22 is a higher density gas tracer , this suggests that fu  ori total disk mass is probably lower than fu  ori  s s disk . on the other hand ,",
    "hcn is detected only toward fu  ori .",
    "hcn forms at large heights above the midplane , where the temperature are higher and the densities are lower compared to the midplane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the hcn detection around fu  ori and not fu  ori  s s could support the idea that the disk around fu  ori has a higher dust temperature compared to the disk around fu  ori  s. as noted above , an average dust temperature below 20  k for fu  ori  s would make it the most massive of the two disks , which would be in agreement with the interpretation of the hco@xmath22 detection .    based on the stellar photospheric absorption features @xcite estimate the accretion rate of fu  ori  s in @xmath37m@xmath3yr@xmath10 .",
    "for fu  ori the accretion rate derived by @xcite is @xmath38m@xmath3yr@xmath10 .",
    "however this is highly model dependent is likely to correspond to the maximum accretion rate during the peak periods of episodic accretion .",
    "it is unlikely that fu  ori s high accretion rate can continue for long .",
    "if fu  ori continues to accrete at @xmath12  m@xmath3  yr@xmath10 , its submillimeter flux would decrease by a factor of ten within a decade . to sustain the disk dust mass",
    "we infer from our alma observations , the stellar accretion rate must be highly variable .",
    "we obtained alma band 7 observations of the fu  ori binary system at 0.6@xmath390.5@xmath40 resolution in cycle 0 .",
    "our observations detect continuum emission from two unresolved sources at the position of each binary component .",
    "this indicates that both binary components have disks . under simple assumptions",
    ", these observations suggest that the most massive disk orbits the less massive star ( fu  ori ) .",
    "the interferometric observations recover the entire flux reported in previous single - dish studies , ruling out the presence of a large envelope for replenishing the disks .",
    "the dust disks were unresolved in our observations , implying that they are significantly smaller than non fu  ori objects such as e.g. ab  aur , hl  tau and hd  163296 .",
    "we report the detection of molecular emission from @xmath6co(3 - 2 ) , hco@xmath7(4 - 3 ) and from hcn(4 - 3 ) . whilst the @xmath6co appears widespread across the two binary components , hco@xmath7 peaks close to the position of the southern binary component .",
    "this suggests that the southern binary component is embedded in dense molecular material , which is consistent with infrared studies that indicate that this is a heavily reddened object .",
    "is this clump the reservoir of material feeding the outburst of the northern binary component ? at this angular resolution",
    "the interaction between the two unresolved disk can not be disentangled .",
    "observations at higher spatial resolution are mandatory to investigate whether interactions between the disks or other mechanisms ( e.g. disk fragmentation ) are causing the outburst .",
