    "the usually feeble force associated with radiation pressure @xcite , a manifestation of the mechanical momentum carried by all electromagnetic waves , has recently proven to be quite effective in manipulating and detecting the motion of micro- and nanomechanical objects embedded within a resonant cavity @xcite .",
    "the simplest form of a cavity - mechanical system consists of a resonant electromagnetic cavity with its resonance frequency dispersively coupled to the position of a mechanical object .",
    "in such a cavity - based scheme , a narrowband electromagnetic source is used to pump the cavity .",
    "mechanical motion translates into modulation in the stored intra - cavity electromagnetic field , and through the filtering properties of the cavity , results in an imprinting of the mechanical motion on the electromagnetic signal .",
    "the resonant enhancement of the pump s radiation pressure in turn , yields strong back - action effects which modify the dynamic mechanical and optical properties of the coupled system .",
    "dynamical back - action effects can include optical stiffening of the mechanical structure @xcite , damping or amplification of the mechanical motion @xcite , or electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite .",
    "cavity - mechanical systems demonstrating near quantum - limited position read - out and strong radiation pressure back - action have been realized both in the optical @xcite and the microwave frequency domains @xcite . in the optical domain one has the advantage of shot - noise limited read - out ( even at room temperature ) and large radiation pressure coupling due to the relatively large operating frequency , whereas in the microwave domain one has the distinct benefit of simple electrical interfacing and compact , robust packaging . here",
    "we present a chip - scale platform for integrating cavity - optomechanics with conventional micro - electromechanical systems ( mems ) in which the mechanical degree of freedom is strongly coupled via radiation pressure to both an electrical circuit as well as a high-@xmath0 optical cavity @xcite .",
    "using an integrated photonic crystal device we demonstrate wide - band ( @xmath119  nm ) electromechanical tuning of the optical cavity resonance , near shot - noise - limited optical read - out of mechanical motion , and electromechanical locking of the optical cavity to a fixed laser source . by combining these device attributes , a series of key optomechanical back - action effects",
    "are also realized , including optical stiffening , back - action cooling , and phonon lasing .",
    "it is envisioned that these coupled electro- and optomechanical systems , driven by radiation pressure and packaged in a chip - scale form factor , may be used to create sensors of electrical @xcite , force @xcite , acceleration , or mass @xcite operating at the quantum limits of sensitivity and bandwidth .",
    "as discussed above , in this work we seek to develop a common platform for cavity electro- and optomechanics , in which both electrical and optical signals are coupled to a common mechanical degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "planar photonic crystals ( pcs ) are particularly promising to this end , since they provide the potential for on - chip integration with well - established microwave and micro - electromechanical systems ( mems ) technologies , and large radiation pressure coupling due to their nanoscale optical mode volumes @xcite .",
    "electromechanical control of microcavities has been shown previously in one - dimensional zipper and double - membrane cavities @xcite .",
    "these approaches , however , were either limited by low tuning speed , high leakage - currents , or the use of low-@xmath0 cavities , which prohibited the observation of radiation back - action effects .        the photonic crystal structure studied in this work , along with the conceptually similar tunable fabry - perot cavity ,",

    "the pc structure is based on a silicon membrane slotted cavity , in which the optical cavity field is localized to the air slot between two pc membranes that are suspended on flexible struts .",
    "two pairs of metal contacts on each membrane act as capacitive mems actuators that provide for electromechanical control of membrane motion and the cavity air slot width .",
    "localization of light in the optical cavity is determined by a two - step compression of the pc lattice constant @xcite along the length of the slotted pc waveguide formed from the two pc membrane halves @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the pc structure was fabricated with a lattice constant of @xmath2 , a relative hole radius of @xmath3 , and a slot width of @xmath4 so as to produce cavity modes in a wavelength band around @xmath5  nm with high-@xmath0 and large radiation pressure coupling .",
    "theoretical estimates for the optical cavity mode frequencies and radiation rates were calculated using a finite - elements method ( fem ) solver which is part of the comsol multiphysics @xcite software package .",

    ", we were able to achieve tunabilities up to @xmath42 ( see appendix  [ secstudyfabdev ] ) .",
    "the accessible tuning range of a given device is limited by electrical arching between the contacts , which occurs around @xmath43 in a nitrogen atmosphere at ambient pressure .",
    "also , due to the large parallel resistance in excess of @xmath44 , current flow in these structures is negligible , minimizing heating and allowing for ultralow power operation . viewed as a wide - range ( @xmath45  thz ) tunable optical filter ( bandwidth @xmath46  ghz ) operating in the telecom c - band , or as a narrowband modulator / switch with ultra - low switching voltage ( @xmath47 at a bias voltage of @xmath48  v ) ,",
    "the present device performance is impressive due in large part to the strong optomechanical coupling .",
    "in addition to the optical properties of the pc cavity , the mechanical mode structure of the presented system can be investigated by monitoring the radio - frequency ( rf ) power spectral density ( psd ) of laser light transmitted through a cavity mode . to this end",
    ", we launch a tunable external cavity diode laser into the fundamental or second order cavity mode , and actively stabilize the cavity frequency to a detuning of half an optical linewidth from the laser .",
    "the transmitted pump light is detected on a high - speed photodetector ( 125  mhz bandwidth ) , and the fluctuation power spectral density of the photocurrent is computed with a high - speed digitizing oscilloscope . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) this is shown for transmission of a probe laser through the second order cavity mode .",

    "2(c ) ) of the two individual membranes , split by fabrication asymmetries .",
    "moreover , hybridization with a near - resonant out - of - plane ( flexural ) mode ( see left inset in fig .  2(c ) ) that originates from the breaking of out - of - plane symmetry induced by the presence of the top metal contacts gives rise to the additional features at 2.9 and 3.15  mhz ( see appendix  [ secmechspectra ] ) . the mechanical modes shown here",
    "can also be resonantly addressed by driving the actuators with a sinusoidal modulation voltage ( see appendix  [ secactuning ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0-factors of the mechanical modes were found to be in the range 50100 , limited by air - damping   @xcite , thus allowing for high - speed tuning of the structure at rates limited by the mechanical time - constant of @xmath51 .    despite its unique benefits for the readout and manipulation of micromechanical motion , optomechanical back - action",
    "has hitherto not found technological application in large part due to the need for elaborate tunable laser - sources to control the relative cavity - pump laser detuning . in the presented system , however , frequency tunability is solely afforded by electromechanical actuation , thus allowing for the study of optomechanical effects using simple fixed - frequency laser sources .",
    "as an example of this , fig .  [ fig3](a ) shows an oscilloscope trace of the transmission of a strong pump laser ( @xmath52 ) through the second order cavity mode ( blue curve ) while applying a 50  hz triangular wave to the actuators ( orange curve ) .",
    "both the triangular shape of the transmission curve and the asymmetry between forward- and backward scans arise from the well - known thermal bistability of silicon microcavities @xcite . using electromechanical frequency tuning",
    "then , we can actively lock the cavity to a fixed - frequency pump laser . to this end",
    ", we actively control the cavity electrical contacts with a commercial pi - control loop .",
    "the error signal is obtained from the transmission level of the pump laser which therefore is proportional to the intracavity photon number @xmath53 . additionally ,",
    "although not performed here , using a feedback loop of sufficient bandwidth allows for active feedback cooling ( `` cold - damping '' ) and amplification of the mechanical mode @xcite .",
    "as an example of electrically controlled optomechanical back - action , we study the optical spring effect by tuning the cavity in resonance with the blue - detuned pump laser .",
    "figure  [ fig3](b ) shows a series of rf - modulation spectra while changing the intracavity photon number @xmath53 in the second order cavity mode .",
    "this is achieved by actively locking the tunable cavity to different levels of the pump laser transmission as described above .",
    "the higher frequency mode initially at @xmath54  mhz is renormalized by the radiation pressure coupling to the internal cavity field into the in - plane differential mode of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b )  @xcite , and shifts to @xmath55 for @xmath56 ( note that the lower frequency mode at @xmath57  mhz shifts very little , as it is renormalized to the uncoupled common mode of motion between the membrane halves ) .",
    "the observed frequency shift is consistent with @xmath58 , in reasonable agreement with the theoretically expected value .",
    "the optical spring effect is rather unique in that it only affects the dynamic spring constant of the mechanical system responding to fluctuations around mechanical equilibrium , but leaves alone the static stiffness of the structure @xcite .",
    "increasing the wide - range tunability of a micro - mechanical device by reducing the spring constant @xmath59 naturally leads to a compromise in which the noise is increased due to thermal processes .",
    "the frequency jitter of the cavity resonance in the highly flexible structures of this work is estimated to be @xmath60 , almost the entire measured optical linewidth of @xmath61  pm . as a result ,",
    "time - averaged transmission scans like that of the fundamental optical cavity resonance shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) are predominantly thermally broadened .",
    "the red line here shows a fit assuming a voigt line profile ( see appendix  [ secvoigtfits ] ) that allows us to estimate an intrinsic linewidth of @xmath62@xmath63  pm with thermal gaussian line broadening of @xmath64  pm . using optomechanical back - action this thermal noise can be overcome , without sacrifice in tunability , by increasing @xmath65 using the optical spring effect .    in order to investigate the effect of the reduction of thermal membrane motion by increasing @xmath65 via the optomechanical spring effect",
    ", we monitor transmission spectra of the fundamental cavity mode as function of @xmath53 stored in the second order ( pump ) cavity mode . to this end , we use two separate telecom external - cavity diode lasers that are combined via a fiber - based optical beamsplitter before entering the fiber taper and that are individually detected after being separated by a fiber - based transmission / reflection bandpass filter at the taper output .",
    "one laser ( pump laser ) is kept at a fixed wavelength close to the second order optical cavity mode .",
    "again , the detuning with the pump laser can then be controlled electrostatically .",
    "at the same time , the second laser is swept across the fundamental mode , resulting in the transmission spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) for various values of @xmath53 . as @xmath53 increases , the cavity modes red - shift due to heating of the structure , which counter - acts the electrostatically induced blue - shift and results in the saturation of cavity tuning . at the same time , the linewidth of the fundamental cavity mode decreases significantly , as can be seen from the cuts through fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](e)(g ) .",
    "the linewidths @xmath66 extracted from the transmission curves are shown as the blue bullets in fig .",
    "[ fig3](h ) , while the red bullets express the width as an effective @xmath0-factor @xmath67 . while the initial linewidth is 21  pm , for @xmath56 we observe narrowing to 8  pm , corresponding to an intrinsic optical @xmath0-factor of @xmath68 ( see si for details ) .",
    "this is more consistent with the observed cavity linewidths of @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) on nominally identical , mechanically rigid test cavities .",
    "using electromechanical control of the cavity frequency , we can also realize parametric amplification ( phonon lasing ) and back - action cooling .",
    "figure  [ fig4](a ) shows mechanical spectra of a different device while sweeping the fundamental cavity mode across resonance with a pump laser with @xmath71 . for a blue - detuned pump laser ( @xmath72 )",
    "we observe stiffening of the mechanical modes  similar to fig .",
    "[ fig3](h )  while for red detuning we observe softening , indicated by a reduction of the mechanical mode frequencies . in the electro - optomechanical pc cavity",
    ", we can switch between the two regimes by using a fixed - frequency pump and simply changing a voltage .",
    "tuning the cavity such that the pump laser is blue detuned from the optical mode results in phonon lasing , while red detuning leads to cooling . in this system",
    "we can realize both regimes , as we will show in the following .",
    "figure  [ fig4](b ) shows rf - spectra for driving the system with @xmath73 on the blue side , with detunings below ( lower panel ) and above ( upper panel ) the lasing threshold . above threshold",
    "we observe line - narrowing and an enhancement of the mechanical resonance peak by approximately four orders of magnitude . in the time domain",
    ", this corresponds to a large , periodic modulation of the cavity transmission signal , as is evident from the time trace shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) . for red detuning",
    ", we observe cooling of the membrane motion . to this end",
    ", we mechanically anchor the fiber taper on one of the cavity membranes in order to suppress spurious out - of - plane modes ( see appendix  [ secappbackaction ] ) and to reduce temporal drift of the fiber taper .",
    "we then lock the cavity a half - linewidth red from the pump laser and monitor rf - spectra while increasing the power @xmath74 launched into the cavity .",
    "figure  [ fig4](d ) shows the membrane displacement spectral density @xmath75 for a series of @xmath53 .",
    "the resonance at 3.55  mhz corresponds to motion of a single membrane .",
    "clearly , we observe optical damping of the mechanical mode with increasing photon number , evident from the increasing linewidth @xmath76 of the resonance ( blue dots in fig .",
    "[ fig4](e ) ) . measuring the area under the mechanical resonance ( proportional to the phonon occupancy and thus the effective temperature ) shows that in addition to optically - induced damping , there is optical cooling of the mechanical motion , with the effective temperature of the mode ( red dots in fig .",
    "[ fig4](e ) ) reducing to @xmath77 .",
    "as the above measurements indicate , the electro - optomechanical pc cavity structure demonstrated here provides a unique level of control of the optical properties of the device via electromechanical actuation , and , importantly , maintains the device characteristics necessary for strong radiation pressure coupling and optomechanical back - action .",
    "this device architecture is also adaptable to integration with higher frequency ( ghz ) mechanical resonances ( in the form of optomechanical crystals for instance @xcite ) , enabling operation in the sideband - resolved regime critical for quantum applications @xcite .",
    "moreover , the scalability afforded by the cmos - compatible , on - chip architecture of this device platform , allows for mass production , integration with on - chip electronics , and the straightforward engineering of coupled - cavity arrays .",
    "applications for such devices range from wavelength filters and ultralow - power optical modulators , to quantum - limited force sensors  @xcite .",
    "moreover , future devices in which an optical cavity and a radio - frequency resonant circuit share a common mechanical degree of freedom are foreseeable , paving the way for experiments at the interface of cavity opto- and electro - mechanics @xcite , such as the implementation of efficient inter - band signal conversion @xcite .",
