    "one of the missing states in the charmonium family , the @xmath18 , is the only missing spin - singlet low - lying d - wave charmonium state .",

    "the @xmath21 quantum number of @xmath17 is @xmath0 , thus its decay to @xmath19 is forbidden .",
    "therefore , this is a narrow resonance state , and its main decay modes are the electromagnetic and hadronic transitions to lower - lying s- , p - wave charmonium states and the annihilation decays to light hadrons .",
    "previously , we calculated the inclusive light hadronic decay width of the @xmath22 state at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in @xmath2 @xcite in the framework of non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) .",
    "the results show that with the total width of @xmath17 estimated to be about 660 - 810 kev , the branching ratio of the electric dipole transition @xmath23 is about @xmath24 , which will be useful in searching for this missing charmonium state through @xmath23 followed by @xmath25 and other processes .",
    "the nrqcd factorization method@xcite was adopted in our calculation of @xmath17 light hadronic decay . within this framework",
    ", the inclusive decay and production of heavy quarkonium can be factorized into two parts , the short - distance coefficients and the long - distance matrix elements .",
    "a color - octet heavy quark and anti - quark pair annihilated or produced at short distances can evolve into a color - singlet heavy quarkonium at long distances via electric or magnetic transitions by emitting soft gluons , this color - octet mechanism has been used to remove the infrared ( ir ) divergences in p - wave @xcite and d - wave @xcite charmonium decays .",
    "now , we turn to the b - meson non - leptonic decays , which have played an important role in discovering new resonances , especially new charmonium and charmonium - like states in recent years . the branching fractions of b - meson inclusive decays into s - wave and p - wave charmonia , of @xmath26 to @xmath27@xcite , are relatively large .",
    "therefore , we may also expect to search for d - wave charmonia in b - meson decays , and in particular to search for the spin - singlet d - wave charmonium @xmath17 in @xmath28 . like the charmonium light hadronic decay , charmonium production in b - meson semi - inclusive decay",

    "s - wave and p - wave charmonium production in b - meson semi - inclusive decays have already been studied by many authors in the literature @xcite . in @xcite , it was found that the experimentally observed branching fractions for @xmath32 and @xmath33 could be accounted for by nlo calculations , while for @xmath34 and @xmath35 the branching ratios were still difficult to explain . in @xcite , the branching fractions for d - wave charmonium production in b - meson",
    "semi - inclusive decays were calculated to be of @xmath26 in nrqcd at leading order ( lo ) , where the nrqcd velocity scaling rules were used to estimate the long - distance matrix elements .",
    "similar results but somewhat larger branching fractions were also obtained in @xcite .",
    "however , the nlo qcd corrections are found to be very important in many heavy quarkonium production processes , e.g. in @xmath36 annihilation@xcite , hadroproduction@xcite , and photoproduction@xcite .",
    "moreover , the velocity scaling rules are too rough to give a quantitative estimate for the long - distance matrix elements",
    ". therefore , for d - wave charmonium production in b - meson semi - inclusive decays , aside from @xcite , a nlo calculation and a better estimate for the matrix elements are necessary .",
    "another important motivation for carrying out this study concerns the long - standing puzzle of the nature of @xmath16 .",
    "previous studies assumed that the quantum numbers of the @xmath16 were @xmath37 , and this was supported by a number of measurements .",
    "however , the new  measurement of @xmath38  @xcite favors the negative - parity assignment @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , people still argue that the observed properties of @xmath16 strongly disfavor the @xmath0 assignment@xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed that the angular distributions of decay products could be used to distinguish between the @xmath39 and @xmath0 assignments of @xmath16 . in this paper",

    "we now discuss the possible relation between the semi - inclusive decay branching ratio @xmath239 and the exclusive decay branching ratio @xmath240 .",
    "obviously , the latter must be much smaller than the former , since the @xmath130 includes many hadronic states other than the kaon .",
    "in particular , in the case of @xmath239 , the dominant contribution comes from the color - octet @xmath241 channels , which subsequently evolve into @xmath17 by emitting soft gluons which then turn into light hadrons such as pions . whereas the exclusive process @xmath242 requires the soft gluons be reabsorbed by the strange quark in @xmath243 .",
    "this probability is apparently very small . as a conservative estimate",
    ", we believe the branching ratio of @xmath240 should be smaller than that of @xmath239 by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "the suppression of exclusive decay relative to inclusive decay is supported by many other charmonium states .",

    "for @xmath35 , which is similar to @xmath17 because in both cases at lo the color - singlet @xmath241 fock states make no contributions , @xmath251 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 , the suppression of exclusive decay is almost by two - order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , we may have a general observation that for a charmonium state produced in b - meson decays , the suppression factor of exclusive production branching ratio relative to inclusive one should not be larger than 1/10 ( including the factorizable and non - factorizable exclusive processes ) .",
    "this means @xmath254 should be at most @xmath255 , based on our calculation .",
    "in contrast , for x(3872 ) the observed branching ratio @xmath256 @xcite . considering that there exist many decay modes of x(3872 ) other than @xmath257 , we may conclude that @xmath41 is at least 10 times larger than @xmath254 .",
    "therefore , @xmath16 is unlikely to be the @xmath258 charmonium state @xmath17 . in fact , for x(3872 ) the @xmath37 assignments of the @xmath259 molecule@xcite or a charmonium-@xmath259 mixed state@xcite are preferred by many authors , instead of a @xmath258 state ( for more discussions see a recent review @xcite ) .",

    "unlike @xmath17 light hadronic decay , in this process , there is no residual divergence at nlo of the @xmath119}$ ] fock state , due to the vanishing tree - level contribution of @xmath9}$ ] . at nlo in @xmath2 ,",
