    "the main motivation for studying thermoelectricity in quantum systems is the promise to increase the conversion efficiency by reducing the dimension .",
    "indeed , the first measurements of values larger than one for the figure of merit were obtained in superlattices and quantum dot superlattices @xcite .",
    "these observations were the trigger signal of a large number of both experimental and theoretical works .",
    "an increase of the thermopower has been obtained in molecular junctions between a gold substrate and a gold scanning tunneling microscope tip  @xcite , and measurements of the seebeck coefficient have been performed in carbon nanotubes @xcite , control break junctions  @xcite , magnetic tunnel junctions @xcite , spin valves  @xcite , and kondo quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "non - linear thermovoltage and thermocurrent in quantum dot have been highlighted  @xcite .",
    "extensive theoretical works were performed in order to understand how thermoelectric properties are affected in nanosystems with multi channels @xcite , multi - terminals @xcite , on - site interaction @xcite , inelastic scattering @xcite , and time - dependent voltage @xcite .",
    "in addition , the validity of the onsager relation linking the seebeck and peltier coefficients , the validity of the wiedemann - franz and fourier laws were questioned in nanosystems @xcite . indeed , the breakdown of thermoelectric reciprocity relations has been experimentally observed recently in a four - terminals mesoscopic device @xcite .",
    "a key point for thermoelectricity in nanosystems is the fact that the tools used to quantify the efficiency for classical systems fail to describe the quantum ones . in particular , the figure of merit is a concept which makes sense only in the linear response regime .",
    "indeed , the optimization of the figure of merit outside the linear response regime does not guarantee the optimization of the efficiency @xcite .",
    "the appropriate approach is to rather consider directly the efficiency , and look for the optimization of the ratio between electrical and heat powers @xcite .    in parallel , the interest in heat noise in quantum systems is growing up @xcite .",
    "however , these studies are mainly restricted to correlations between the heat current and itself .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that the correlator between heat currents in distinct reservoirs is not necessary negative contrary to what happens with charge currents @xcite .",
    "it is only recently that the correlation between heat and charge currents  what we call mixed noise  has been considered for thermoelectricity @xcite . in particular , to analyse a quantum - dot based engine , sanchez and co - workers introduced a ratio between the different kinds of noises which is maximal for the optimal configuration of this particular thermoelectric nanosystem @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we adopt a general viewpoint and investigate in great details the mixed noise and ratios of noises using the landauer - bttiker formalism @xcite .",
    "we derived the explicit expressions of heat , charge and mixed noises as well as ratios of noises and thermoelectric differential conductances for the following two nanosystems : a quantum point contact ( qpc ) coupled to an ohmic environment and a quantum dot ( qd ) connected to two reservoirs .    in the linear response regime , we recover fluctuation - dissipation theorems which link the electrical and thermal conductances to the charge and heat noises .",
    "the same kind of fluctuation - dissipation theorem applies for mixed noises provided that one considers the mixed thermoelectric conductances .",
    "as a consequence , the figure of merit is related to the ratio between the square of mixed noise and the product of heat and charge noises . in the non - linear response regime , we were guided to distinguish between two ratios of noises : the cross - ratio that is defined between two different reservoirs and the auto - ratio defined inside the same reservoir .",
    "significantly , for the two nanosystems , the cross - ratio can reach larger values than one , while the auto - ratio can not exceed one . in between these two regimes",
    ", the cross - ratio reveals complex behaviors that we connect to the features of the different kind of noises . despite this complexity",
    ", we find that in the schottky regime the thermoelectric efficiency is still given by the noises but with an expression which differs from the one obtained in the linear response regime .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we define all the quantities we are interested in , i.e. , differential conductances , current noises at zero frequency and ratios of noises .",
    "we give the general expressions of these quantities obtained in the framework of the landauer - bttiker scattering theory in sec .",
    "iii , and their reduced expressions in both the linear response regime and high voltage regime in sec .",
    "iv . in secs .  v and vi , we apply our results to a qpc and a qd and discuss various regimes .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "we define the following zero - frequency current correlators between the reservoirs @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the charge ( heat ) current operator , and @xmath5 the charge ( heat ) average current in the reservoir @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath6 corresponds to the charge noise and @xmath7 corresponds to the heat noise , whereas @xmath8 and @xmath9 correspond to the correlations between charge and heat currents .",
    "we call them _ mixed _ noises . in the following ,",
    "we restrict our work to a two terminal system , thus @xmath10 , where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) refers to the left ( right ) reservoir driven at chemical potential @xmath13 and temperature @xmath14 . as a general rule ,",
    "we call _ auto_-quantities when calculated for @xmath15 , and _ cross_-quantities when calculated for @xmath16 .",
    "next , we introduce the differential conductances defined as : @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 correspond to the electrical and thermal differential conductances , whereas @xmath20 and @xmath21 are differential mixed conductances that locally reflect the thermoelectric conversion . in the linear response regime , these last two conductances are related to the seebeck and peltier coefficients ( see sec .  [ high_temp ] ) . in the non - linear response regime , these differential conductances are the adequate quantities to consider since the currents vary as power laws with the voltage as we will show in secs .",
    "we also use average conductances merely defined as : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "finally , we introduce a dimensionless quantity : the ratio between the product of mixed correlations on the one hand , and the product of charge and heat ones on the other hand : @xmath26 this ratio gives indications on the mixed correlations between the heat and charge currents : ( i ) @xmath27 when heat and charge currents are uncorrelated between reservoirs @xmath0 and @xmath1 , ( ii ) @xmath28 when heat and charge currents are maximally correlated and , ( iii ) @xmath29 when the left and right heat currents are uncorrelated . indeed , whereas @xmath30 because of the cauchy - schwarz inequality , we will obtain here that no such limitation applies for @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , the fact that the cross - ratio and auto - ratio differ or that @xmath32 means that the system operates outside the linear response regime .",
    "information about the mixed correlation between energy and charge currents can be obtained from this ratio .",
    "indeed we have equivalently : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the energy noise and @xmath35 is the charge - energy noise which measure the correlations related to the energy current : @xmath36 . having @xmath37 means either that energy fluctuations are absent : @xmath38 ( @xmath39 never cancels at finite temperature and/or finite voltage ) , or that there is an exact compensation between the charge - energy and energy - energy correlators , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "note that another type of ratio was defined in ref .",
    "for a three - terminal quantum dot engine that could be written as @xmath41 .",
    "it is still bounded and it reaches the value one when mixed correlations are maximal .",
    "we derive the formal expressions of the differential conductances , and heat , charge and mixed noises at zero frequency within the landauer - bttiker scattering theory @xcite .",
    "we assume that the transmission coefficient @xmath42 through the nanoscopic conductor does not depend on the external variables @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite .      to get the differential conductances",

    "moreover , combining these relations , we deduce : @xmath86 in the limit of zero voltage , the total heat noise cancels in agreement with ref .  . the total charge noise , given by eq .

    "<S> mixed , charge and heat current fluctuations as well as thermoelectric differential conductances are considered for non - interacting nanosystems connected to reservoirs . using the landauer - bttiker formalism </S>",
    "<S> , we derive general expressions for these quantities and consider their possible relationships in the entire ranges of temperature , voltage and coupling to environment or reservoirs . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a dimensionless quantity given by the ratio between the product of mixed noises and the product of charge and heat noises , distinguishing between the auto - ratio defined in the same reservoir and the cross - ratio between distinct reservoirs . from the linear response regime to the high voltage regime </S>",
    "<S> , we further specify the analytical expressions of differential conductances , noises and ratios of noises , and examine their behavior in two concrete nanosystems : a quantum point contact in an ohmic environment and a single energy level quantum dot connected to reservoirs . in the linear response regime , we find that these ratios are equal to each other and are simply related to the figure of merit . </S>",
    "<S> they can also be expressed in terms of differential conductances with the help of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . in the non - linear regime </S>",
    "<S> , these ratios radically distinguish between themselves as the auto - ratio remains bounded by one while the cross - ratio exhibits rich and complex behaviors . in the quantum dot nanosystem , we moreover demonstrate that the thermoelectric efficiency can be expressed as a ratio of noises in the non - linear schottky regime . in the intermediate voltage regime , </S>",
    "<S> the cross - ratio changes sign and diverges , which evidences a change of sign in the heat cross - noise . </S>"
