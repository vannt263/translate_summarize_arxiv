    "sn 1978k was first discovered in 1990 as a strong h@xmath5 source during a survey of h  ii regions in the nearby spiral galaxy ngc 1313 @xcite .",
    "the object was initially classified as a nova , with a nebular spectrum exhibiting strong emission lines , until further observations suggested that it was actually a supernova ( sn ) well into the late - time phase @xcite .",
    "the sn still radiates strongly in x - ray and radio wavelengths for many years after the supposed explosion in mid-1978 , indicating an on - going interaction of the sn ejecta with dense circumstellar medium ( csm ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that a possible progenitor of sn 1978k has been identified in pre - explosion photographic plates , having @xmath6 mag , in 1974 - 1975 . with their adopted distance to ngc 1313 of 4.5 mpc ( @xmath7 mag ) and assuming no reddening , that magnitude would correspond to a luminous blue object with absolute magnitude of @xmath8 mag .",
    "the object seemed to fade below @xmath9 in oct 1977 , then came into outburst in 1978 .",
    "only four data points in the light curve were recovered from the 1978 outburst , with brightest magnitude @xmath10 reached on 1978 jul 31 , and no spectroscopic data exist during the early phase",
    ". therefore the actual sn type classification of this object is unknown although late - time observations show that the csm is hydrogen - rich , suggesting a type - ii event .",
    "@xcite suggested that sn 1978k is associated with csm similar to the ejecta nebulae of luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars , based on the detection of the narrow components of h@xmath5 and [ n  ii ] in high - resolution spectroscopy , which were interpreted as having originated in the unshocked csm .",
    "this detection was also later confirmed by @xcite .",
    "lbv stars such as @xmath11 car and p cyg are evolved massive stars that have been known to undergo irregular variability and eruptive mass loss episodes .",
    "a good number of sne iin have been associated with lbv progenitors ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the connection between lbv stars and type - iin sne has often been suggested in the recent literature , alternatively red supergiant stars have also been proposed as one viable progenitor for this kind of objects ( e.g. sn 1998s , * ? ? ?",
    "sn 1978k is arguably unique among other sne observed at very late times .",
    "the emission lines are evidently narrow ( full width at half maximum ; fwhm @xmath12few hundred km s@xmath1 ) and long - lasting , with a wealth of various species in addition to the commonly detected h@xmath5 , h@xmath13 , and oxygen lines . for comparison ,",
    "sne 1986j and 1979c observed at the age of @xmath1220 years only show a few such lines @xcite , which was also the case for sne 1957d , 1970 g , 1980k and 1993j @xcite .",
    "those sne observed at late times typically show fwhm velocities in the order of several thousands km s@xmath1 , significantly higher than that of sn 1978k .",
    "sn 1986j , for example , exhibits spectra containing dominant h@xmath5 emission with unchanging width between 19861989 ( @xmath1247 years after the supposed explosion time , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and later observations in 1991 and 2007 show that the width had not changed significantly @xcite although the line luminosity diminished greatly during that time period .",

    "the 19901996 spectra were obtained in low resolution ( @xmath14  ) while the 1997/2000 ones were in high resolution echelle spectroscopy ( @xmath15  ) .",
    "here we report the spectroscopy of sn 1978k conducted in 2014 i.e. more than a decade after the last published spectrum and 36 years after the sn explosion , as well as archival spectra and photometry taken in 2007 , and discuss the physical properties of the object derived from the observational data .",
    "the paper proceeds with section [ sec : obs ] describing the observations and data reduction , section [ sec : result ] with the results then section [ sec : discussion ] with the discussions , and ends with the summary .",
    "sn 1978k was observed using the ut3/melipal unit of the very large telescope ( vlt ) at cerro paranal observatory , chile , and the vimos instrument in integral field unit ( ifu ) mode @xcite .",
    "the observation was done as part of an ifu survey of nearby sn explosion sites to study the underlying stellar populations @xcite .",
    "sky conditions during the observation on 2014",
    "november 25 ( ut ) were photometric , with seeing varying between 0.5``0.8 '' during the @xmath16s exposure of the object .",
    "the final image quality measured on the reduced datacube is around 1 \" .",
    "vimos was used in the ifu medium resolution mode with 13``@xmath1713 '' field of view at the scale of 0.33 \" per spaxel .",
    "the spectral coverage is 480010000  , with dispersion of 2.6   / pixel .",
    "the effective line fwhm of the spectrum is @xmath18 8   .",
    "spectrophotometric standard stars were also observed during the same night for the purpose of absolute flux calibration .",
    "the raw data were reduced using the reflex - based vimos ifu pipeline @xcite , resulting in two wavelength- and flux - calibrated datacubes in ( @xmath19 ) format for each of the 1800s exposures .",
    "the two datacubes were averaged and then the resulting final datacube was analysed using qfitsview @xcite .",
    "sn 1978k was identified in the ifu field of view and then the spectrum was extracted from the final science datacube using apertures with radius of 2 and 4 spaxels , corresponding to 0.66 `` and 1.32 '' , respectively .",
    "these apertures were chosen as the radial profile of the sn is not perfectly gaussian , with range in fwhm around 24 spaxels .",
    "this is most likely an artifact of the observation and data reduction .",
    "the sky background was estimated and removed by using an annulus surrounding the extraction aperture .",
    "the spectrum resulting from 4-spaxels aperture radius is more noisy compared to that from 2-spaxels radius due to increased sky contamination . on the other hand",
    ", the 2-spaxels spectrum does not contain the whole flux from the object since the aperture misses the outer wings of the point - spread function .",
    "therefore , we scaled the flux of the 2-spaxels spectrum to match the flux of the 4-spaxels one , with h@xmath5 line flux as a reference .",
    "this scaled spectrum is used in the subsequent spectral analysis using the ` onedspec ` package in iraf .",
    "synthetic _ vri _",
    "magnitudes were calculated from the spectrum , resulting in @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 with estimated errors of @xmath23 mag .    additionally , we found and recovered raw photometric and spectroscopic data of sn 1978k in the eso science archive facility , taken from vlt / fors2 @xcite observations in 2007 .",
    "the data were obtained in two different nights of observation : 2007 july 25 ( photometry , _ bvri _ bands and spectroscopy , _",
    "riz _ bands ) and 2007 september 26 ( spectroscopy , _ b _ band ) under clear sky conditions .",
    "seeing varied between 0.9``1.4 '' ( photometry ) and 0.6``0.8 '' ( spectroscopy ) .",
    "the spectroscopy uses the 1 \" longslit with the gris_600b , gris_600ri , and gris_600z grism configurations .",
    "exposure times were @xmath24s for each grism , respectively .",
    "this resulted in three spectra covering three wavelength regions ( 3500 - 6000  , 5300 - 8500  , 7500 - 10500  ) with dispersion of 0.8  / pixel .",
    "after raw data reduction using the reflex - based fors2 pipeline , both the spectroscopic and photometric data were flux calibrated using spectrophotometric and photometric standard star observations @xcite .",
    "the three spectra were later combined together by averaging overlapping wavelength regions and analysed using iraf as with the 2014 spectrum .",
    "photometry was achieved using the ` apphot ` aperture photometry package within iraf .",
    "the synthetic _",
    "b _ and _ i _ magnitudes calculated from the spectrum agree with magnitudes resulting from direct imaging within 0.1 mag .",
    "r_-band image however , was not usable as sn 1978k was saturated .",
    "therefore , we use the synthetic _",
    "r_-band magnitude for the subsequent analyses .",
    "the 2007 magnitudes are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .    throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the distance to ngc 1313 as @xmath29 pc ( @xmath7 mag ) , according to the new cepheid distance measurement using _ hubble space telescope _ by @xcite .",
    "this is slightly different compared to the value of 4.5 mpc used in , , and , and 4.13 mpc in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in figure  [ lcurve ] the historic light curve of sn 1978k is presented .",
    "photometric data points from and are plotted alongside our 2007/2014 photometry . as has been reported by ,",
    "the light curve evolution during the actual outburst event in 1978 was not well covered .",
    "therefore , the peak in the light curve does not correspond to the actual event of maximum brightness of sn 1978k . shortly prior to the 1978 eruption ,",
    "the progenitor curiously became fainter in blue . while no information on the redder bands exist , it is possible that it expanded to become cooler and redder .",
    "looking at the post-1978 light curve , it seems that there is a significant increase in brightness starting around mid-1980s .",
    "the @xmath30 magnitude brightened from 20.0 in september 1984 , to 18.4 in october 1986 .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath32-bands also seem to follow this behaviour . after the sudden increase ,",
    "the luminosity went down gradually until our latest observation in 2014 .",
    "this sudden increase is interpreted as the onset of the interaction between the sn blastwave and the surrounding csm , analogous to what was experienced by sn 1987a .",
    "we discuss this interaction and comparison to sn 1987a in section [ sec : discussion ] , where the two sne show analogous late time light curves and spectra .",
    "the fors2 and vimos spectra of sn 1978k at year 2007 and 2014 are shown in figure  [ spec78k ] , together with a synthetic spectrum representing the one taken in 1992 for comparison .",
    "the original 1992 efosc2 raw data were not available for retrieval in the eso archives .",
    "therefore , the 1992 spectrum was generated by constructing gaussian curves with fwhm of 560 km s@xmath1 , the observed h@xmath5 fwhm which is comparable to the instrumental fwhm of the 1992 spectrum , and using tabulated wavelength and line fluxes in to position the lines along the wavelength axis and scale the line strengths .",
    "overall , the spectra show very similar appearances , which indicates that the same physical process is still continuing after two decades .",
    "the spectra are dominated by narrow emission lines , in particular h@xmath5 is the strongest , and also numerous other lines from various elements primarily helium , oxygen , and iron .",
    "the spectra of and also show a similar appearance with the spectra displayed here in figure [ spec78k ] , although of a somewhat lower signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we measure the line fluxes in the 2007/2014 spectra by fitting gaussian profiles to the lines , after removing the very weak continuum component by fitting a linear function .",
    "we also applied deblending process in case two nearby lines are not well separated .",
    "table  [ linetable ] lists the lines identified in the spectrum .",
    "line identifications follow that of sn 1987a @xcite and sn 2009kn @xcite .",
    "we identified most of the lines within our spectral wavelength range originally detected in 1992 , with the exception of the ambiguous [ fe x ] coronal line .",

    "we first examine the evolution of the h@xmath5 flux as the strongest line in the optical regime .",
    "the observed h@xmath5 flux in 2014 ( 2007 ) is @xmath42 @xmath43 erg @xmath44 s@xmath1 , corresponding to the luminosity of @xmath45 @xmath46 erg s@xmath1 . as with the 1992 spectrum where the line identifications are near - complete",

    "we dereddened the flux from a total line of sight absorption of @xmath47 mag , assuming @xmath48 and interstellar extinction law of @xcite .",
    "we note that this corresponds to @xmath49 mag , while quoted @xmath50 from the same source .",
    "the unreddened h@xmath5 luminosity in 2014 ( 2007 ) is thus 3.47 ( 3.55 ) @xmath51 erg s@xmath1 .    from figure  [ halum ]",
    "it is evident that the h@xmath5 luminosity has been decreasing slowly since 1992 . as reported by , the h@xmath5 luminosity peaked around 1990 , from which point afterwards it decreases .",

    "it is evident that the lines exhibit various behaviours .    the h@xmath13/h@xmath5 ratio , or the inverse balmer decrement , decreases from 1990 to 1992 , but shoots up in 1996 , decreases in 2007 and then drops again in 2014 .",
    "the same behaviour is also seen in the [ o  iii ] line .",
    "it is to be noted that the spectra obtained in the 1990s were taken with slit spectroscopy that may have been affected by slit - loss and differential atmospheric refraction effects , which did not affect the 2014 spectrum taken with ifu spectroscopy .",
    "fors2 , while working in slit spectrosocpy mode , is equipped with an atmospheric dispersion corrector .",
    "mentioned that their 1996 spectrum may have suffered from differential refraction , causing them to lose more of the red light compared to the blue .",
    "this may explain the behaviour seen in the ratio of lines bluer than 5500  , where all the 1996 data points are higher up compared to the others . in the red part of the spectrum where the differential refraction effect is weaker the systematic behaviour is more visible .",

    "ngc 1313 is actively star - forming , and has been suspected to suffer interaction with a tidally disrupted satellite galaxy ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "h i observations also show the presence of an expanding superbubble which is likely to have originated from this interaction @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate is elevated in the south - eastern region of ngc 1313 and the star formation history suggests a recent , local starburst as opposed to a global starburst affecting the whole galaxy .",
    "sn 1978k lies within this south - western interaction region , thus it is quite likely that its progenitor was associated with the starburst .",

    "provided an explanation of the observed spectrum of sn 1978k as originating from radiative shock waves resulting from the interaction between the sn ejecta and dense clouds of circumstellar wind . in this picture",
    "the sn ejecta ploughs through the csm , generating a reverse shock that is followed by a hot cooling region that is responsible for the h@xmath5 emission and then the cool , partially ionized ejecta .",
    "this partially ionized region is responsible for the emission of low - ionization lines such as [ fe  ii ] and [ o  i ] lines .",
    "as time passes , this outflowing , more metal - rich region of sn ejecta would overtake the reverse shock region and as a result the [ fe  ii ] and [ o  i ] line luminosities would increase compared to h@xmath5 .",
    "this is exactly what is observed , as shown in figure  [ linevol2 ] .",
    "the model of emission from csm interaction in type - ii sne by @xcite includes the evolution of line strengths .",
    "however , their model does not predict the same line ratio as observed ( figure  [ linevol2 ] ) . this discrepancy has also been reported by @xcite who followed the evolution of sn 1998s at 14 years , and suggested that it probably stems from the uncertainty in the model to the shock velocity and ejecta density .",

    "the amounts predicted by the models deviate significantly from the observations .",
    "also the line ratios are expected to be increasing with time , a behaviour that is only observed in [ o  i]/h@xmath5 and [ fe  ii]/h@xmath5 .",
    "the decreasing line ratios of the bluer lines with respect to h@xmath5 could have been caused by dust formation , which cause them to suffer greater reddening compared to h@xmath5 .",
    "however , from the line profiles alone there is no obvious evidence for the presence of dust .",
    "the model by @xcite assumes a csm that was created by wind with smoothly decreasing density , inversely proportional to the radius squared , @xmath56 . in this model , the balmer and the low - ionization lines are both associated to the cooling shell which is created by the interaction suffering a rapid cooling .",
    "the high - ionization lines are emitted by the unshocked ejecta that are ionized by the high energy radiation from the interacting region . with a density decrease in the cooling shell",
    ", the balmer decrement ( h@xmath5/h@xmath13 ) also decreases as h@xmath5 becomes progressively optically thin . at the same time , it leads to the increasing importance of the forbidden lines . in this case",
    ", similar behaviour would be displayed by _ both _ the balmer lines and the low - ionization ( i.e. [ o  i ] , [ fe  ii ] ) lines , either together they behave in accordance to the model prediction or opposite to it .",
    "the fact that the two lines show different behaviours suggests that there are different regions of emission for these lines and the csm can not be approximated with a simple spherically symmetric distribution .",
    "furthermore , this is supported by the observed decrease of the inverse balmer decrement , h@xmath13/h@xmath5 ratio , which requires a density increase in the emitting region , or else an increase in the reddening .",

    "@xcite showed that the outer boundary of radio emission is associated with the forward shock in a sn ejecta .",

    "this is the upper limit of the past average expansion velocity and the actual current value would be smaller , though the exact value is unknown . since the expansion velocity of @xmath64 km s@xmath1 is a 37-year average including both pre- and post - csm crash velocities , this would imply a pre - crash free - expansion velocity of greater than 1500 km s@xmath1 .    the picture of sn 1978k would be a sn ejecta freely expanding ( @xmath65 km s@xmath1 ) and crashing into an inhomogeneous csm of dense wind ( @xmath66 km s@xmath1 ) that was previously ejected by the progenitor star , and greatly decelerated resulting in shocks and emissions across the electromagnetic spectrum in the x - ray , optical , and radio wavelengths . as the csm is inhomogeneously distributed , likely in clumps or in a ring or a combination of both ,",
    "some part of the ejecta continues to travel unimpeded at up to @xmath12 1500 km s@xmath1 as high - velocity fragments , while the bulk of the ejecta expands at a somewhat lower velocity .",
    "the presence of low - velocity hydrogen and oxygen may indicate the mixing of hydrogen and oxygen from the high velocity to low velocity due to rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "as time proceeds , the h@xmath5 luminosity decreases due to the progressively smaller mass encountered by the ejecta . on the other hand",
    ", the h@xmath13/h@xmath5 ratio decreases due to the shocked region becoming progressively of higher density , which argues against the @xmath67 csm and probably indicating a clumpy csm .",
    "the 500 km s@xmath1 velocity displayed by the optical emission lines represents the velocity of the decelerated forward shock or the reverse shock .",
    "another possibility is that the csm is approximately spherical , where the @xmath64 km s@xmath1 upper velocity limit derived from the radio represents the forward shock and 500 km s@xmath1 represents the reverse shock .",
    "nevertheless , in this situation typically the two velocities are similar , as long as the reverse shock is still in the outer steep density profile of the envelope .",
    "sn 1978k is well evolved , therefore it could be possible that the reverse shock already reached deep into the region in the ejecta where the density structure can be flat . in this case , it could be possible to have a large velocity difference between the forward and reverse shocks .",
    "however , as has been discussed above the evolution of the line ratios and the velocity profiles indicate that a spherically symmetric csm is not plausible .",
    "the mass loss rate of the progenitor star can be estimated from the luminosity of the h@xmath5 line , as the shock in the csm is the dominant source of luminosity @xcite :    @xmath68    here if we adopt wind velocity @xmath69 = 70 - 100 km s@xmath1 and shock velocity @xmath70 = 500 - 600 km s@xmath1 , the mass loss rate @xmath71 would be in the order of 0.01 m@xmath3 yr@xmath1 .",
    "this assumes an efficiency factor @xmath72 , which is actually applicable for young sne and decreases to nearly zero with time . in the case of sn 1978k at the age of several decades",
    ", @xmath73 would be significantly smaller than 0.1 , therefore the derived mass loss rate of @xmath74 m@xmath3 yr@xmath1 would be a lower limit .",
    "this implies that the progenitor of sn 1978k suffered heavy mass loss , with rate at least comparable to type - iin sn progenitors with the highest mass loss rates @xcite and the averaged mass loss rate in the events of lbv giant eruptions @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the observed h@xmath5 luminosity and the prediction from @xcite in figure [ halum ] show that the observed h@xmath5 luminosity is about two orders of magnitude higher than the model .",
    "to first approximation , the model scales with @xmath75 , which assumes @xmath76 m@xmath3 yr@xmath1 and @xmath77 km s@xmath1 .",
    "scaling this by two orders of magnitude would require a mass loss rate in the order of @xmath12 0.05 m@xmath3 yr@xmath1 for similar wind velocities , which is quite consistent with the value calculated above .",
    "the csm density parameter @xmath78 is defined as proportional to @xmath79 , assuming a steady - state mass loss , where @xmath80 for the case of @xmath81 m@xmath3 yr@xmath1 and @xmath82 km s@xmath1 @xcite . for sn 1978k , adopting the wind velocity and mass loss rate derived above , this would result in an extremely high density csm with @xmath83 .",
    "this is several orders of magnitude higher than the derived values for evolved massive stars such as wolf - rayet and red / yellow supergiant stars , and some well - studied type - iib sn progenitors @xcite .",
    "following equation ( 2 ) of @xcite , we estimate the amount of ionized hydrogen in the csm of sn 1978k using the h@xmath5 line luminosity .",
    "this equation essentially calculates the number of recombinations of ionized hydrogen that gives rise to the h@xmath5 emission , and does not strongly depend on the csm geometry .",
    "assuming model a velocity structure , the amount of ionized hydrogen at the age of 36 years would be @xmath84 m@xmath3 if electron density is equal to proton density ( @xmath85 ) . by comparing the relative flux @xmath86 ( case b recombination , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is found that @xmath87 .",
    "this would mean that the csm is composed of @xmath88 of h@xmath89 and @xmath90 of he@xmath89 .",
    "thus , the electron density @xmath91 would correspond to @xmath92 . adopting this value of electron density would increase the estimated h envelope mass by a factor of @xmath93 , and therefore would not significantly change the derived value of @xmath94 m@xmath3 .",
    "electron density can be estimated using line ratios from specific ions that were emitted by different levels with similar excitation energy , such as [ s  ii ] @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "the observed line ratio in sn 1978k is close to 0.2 , which corresponds to high electron density exceeding @xmath96 @xmath97 . @xcite",
    "estimated the electron density to be ( 3 - 12 ) @xmath98 @xmath97 . using equation ( 4 ) of @xcite ,",
    "the radius of the shock is estimated to be @xmath99 - 0.10 pc if electron density is between 12 and 3 @xmath98 @xmath97 . the explosion energy was then estimated by making use of equation ( 2.8 ) of @xcite . the equation calculates the shock radius from the mass loss rate , wind velocity , sn age , and reference density of the stellar density profile @xmath100 . assuming a flat outer density profile ( @xmath101 ) , @xmath100 was estimated to be @xmath102 g @xmath97 if the shock radius was 0.05 pc . a larger shock radius of 0.10 pc yields @xmath103 g @xmath97 .",
    "table 1 of @xcite gives the values of @xmath100 for set explosion energy of @xmath104 erg and ejecta mass of @xmath105 m@xmath3 .",
    "as the density scales with @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) , the @xmath100 values are used to scale and estimate the explosion energy of sn 1978k to be in the range of @xmath12 0.1 - 2.0 @xmath108 erg , assuming an ejecta mass of 10 m@xmath3 .",
    "looking back at the historic light curve presented in figure [ lcurve ] , the sudden brightening in the mid-1980s is strikingly apparent .",
    "if this sudden brightening is interpreted as the result of the interaction between the sn ejecta and the csm , the csm would be located at less than 0.01 pc away assuming an ejecta expanding at 1500 km s@xmath1 .",
    "csm located at this distance would require it to be produced by the dense progenitor wind @xmath12150 years before the explosion . as the average pre - shock expansion velocity is likely to be higher than 1500 km s@xmath1",
    ", the actual distance to the csm would be larger thus it should have been formed earlier .",
    "the interaction - powered luminosity evolution approximately follows a power - law decay , represented with a dashed line in figure [ lcurve ] .",
    "bumps above the line ( data points around 1990 and 1996 ) may indicate that the csm is clumpy , causing temporary brightness increases when the shock lights up the clumps .     by assuming the volume of the csm",
    ", the total mass of hydrogen in the csm can be estimated by multiplying it with the hydrogen number density and the mass of a hydrogen atom . with a number density of @xmath109 @xmath97 and assuming a spherically distributed csm with an upper limit of radius of 0.05 pc as constrained by the 2015 _ vlbi _ observations",
    ", this will amount to about 1.3 m@xmath3 of hydrogen in the csm .",
    "however , as previously discussed the csm geometry is likely to be non - spherical , and its size smaller and would not fully fill the sphere with 0.05 pc radius .",
    "furthermore , the clumpy or ring - like csm would not subtend a solid angle encompassing the entire surface of the shell therefore the actual csm mass should not exceed 1.3 m@xmath3 . note that the amount of ionized hydrogen derived using the h@xmath5 line luminosity is about 0.7 m@xmath3 , in agreement with this estimate . while proposed a high csm mass of @xmath110 m@xmath3 in a large ( @xmath111 pc ) csm shell , proposed a clumpy model of csm to derive the mass of @xmath112 m@xmath3 .",
    "our estimates are more consistent with a @xmath113 m@xmath3 csm , and concur with the picture proposed by @xcite where the sn ejecta is significantly decelerated by a dense , closer csm although the exact geometry of the csm is unknown .",
    "the evolution of sn 1978k during the 1980s has been investigated by .",
    "after the 1978 event , the object faded to its pre - sn magnitude and remained so from at least 1981 , then slowly brightened again towards the end of the decade .",
    "the 843 mhz radio light curve shows that it peaked around the year 1984 , while in the 5 ghz band the peak occurred in early 1981 .",
    "far - infrared _ iras _ data shows that the sn was not detected in 1983 , corresponding to an upper limit of @xmath114 erg s@xmath1 at 10 @xmath115 m .",
    "@xcite suggested the presence of shocked @xmath116 m@xmath3 of circumstellar silicate dust in sn 1978k from the analysis of the infrared sed from 2006 - 2007 _ akari _ and _ spitzer _ data .",
    "the derived infrared luminosity was @xmath117 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "x - ray observations in 1980 with the _ einstein _ x - ray satellite did not detect the sn down to an unabsorbed luminosity @xmath118 erg s@xmath1 , while the 1991 _ rosat _ observation showed that sn 1978k had brightened to @xmath119 erg s@xmath1 in the 0.2 - 2.4 kev range .",
    "the most recent result by @xcite showed that the x - ray unabsorbed luminosity within 0.2 - 10 kev is @xmath120 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite showed that x - ray luminosities of core - collapse sne are typically lower than @xmath121 erg s@xmath1 after @xmath122 days , with sne iin exhibiting the highest luminosity compared to the other sn subclasses .",
    "this is comparable with the exceptionally high x - ray luminosity of sn 1978k , even decades after the explosion .",
    "thermal x - ray emission flux increases with the square of wind density , thus the interpretation is consistent with sn 1978k having exploded into a circumstellar environment dominated by a dense wind typical of sne iin .",
    "the fact that sn 1978k did not show strong radio and x - ray emissions during the earliest years suggests that the immediate csm could have been sparse .",
    "this is probably analogous to sn 1996cr , which was suspected to explode in a cavity - like environment before eventually the ejecta strikes a dense surrounding csm @xcite .",
    "the csm around sne nevertheless exhibit various structures .",
    "the type - ii sn 1996al , for example , has recently been shown to interact with a complex csm , consisting of a dense inner csm and equatorial ring embedded in a less dense but clumpy halo @xcite .",
    "figure  [ spec2n ] shows the comparison of the late - time spectrum of sn 1978k to those of several type - ii sne .",
    "the spectrum of sn 2009ip is with reference to the 2012 event .",
    "] was obtained in 2014 in the same observing program as sn 1978k , using the identical vlt / vimos instrument setup .",
    "spectra of sne 1995 g , 1988z , and 2004et were obtained from the suspect online supernova spectrum archive , while sn 1993j was from the wiserep repository @xcite . from the figure it is apparent that the current spectrum of sn 1978k does not resemble sne iib and iip during their first decade .",
    "it bears more similarities with some sne iin , although there are also notable differences . all of the spectra exhibit dominant balmer lines , and also the indication of iron lines around @xmath125200 - 5400  .",
    "he i lines at @xmath335876 and @xmath337065 are also present in the sne iin . the dominant , narrow [ n ii ] @xmath335755 , he i @xmath335876 and [ o i ] @xmath376300 , 6364 are seen in sn 1978k .",
    "the location of sn 1978k in the host galaxy is also somewhat consistent with type - iin sne on average .",
    "it is located in the host outskirts , nearly 6 kpc from the galaxy center and in the immediate surroundings of sn 1978k there is no star formation detected .",
    "this is similar to sn 2009ip which also exploded in the outskirts of its host galaxy , in a region with insignificant star formation .",
    "@xcite showed that type - iin sne are weakly associated with ongoing star formation , a puzzling fact since these sne are often associated with massive lbv stars .",
    "@xcite noticed the isolated nature of lbv stars in the milky way and magellanic clouds , and suggested that they are mass gainers that were kicked out of binary systems following the sn explosion of the mass donor companion .",
    "note that in general type - ii sne do not follow closely the ongoing star formation as traced by h  ii regions @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare the spectrum of sn 1978k with the nearest modern supernova , sn 1987a .",
    "figure  [ spec87a ] shows the comparison of sn 1978k at 2014 ( age 36 years ) with sn 1987a at 1990 and 2013 ( age 3 and 26 years , respectively ) .",
    "we obtained the 1990 spectrum of sn 1987a @xcite from suspect , while the 2013 vlt / uves echelle spectrum was taken from the eso science archive facility , phase 3 data release of observing program 092.d-0119 @xcite .",
    "sn 1987a , due to its proximity , is spatially resolved and has been very well monitored up until very late phase where the sn ejecta interact with the distinct ring - shaped csm .",
    "the emergence of hot spots in the ring indicates the interaction between the blast wave ( forward shock ) and the csm ring , which occurred first in 1995 , or 8 years after the sn explosion @xcite .",
    "the interaction greatly decelerates the sn ejecta and generates reverse shock in the inner radius of the ring @xcite .",
    "the comparison between sn 1978k and sn 1987a in figure [ spec87a ] immediately shows that the spectra of the two objects at the age of @xmath123 decades look very similar .",
    "nearly the same set of emission lines appear in both sne , with similar relative strengths .",
    "this suggests that the sne are in the same phase of evolution to become young sn remnants , and that similar physical processes are taking place . in sn 1987a",
    "we detect the [ fe xiv ] @xmath335303 line and there is no indication of [ fe x ] @xmath336374 as is the case for sn 1978k ( c.f .",
    "section [ sec : spec ] ) .",
    "as exemplified by sn 1987a where the initially broad spectral lines evolve to become much narrower , this indicates that indeed there is a presence of dense csm around sn 1978k that is decelerating the expansion of the ejecta ( @xmath1210@xmath124 - 10@xmath125 km s@xmath1 assuming typical sn ejecta velocities ; initially @xmath1235 000 km s@xmath1 in the case of sn 1987a ) thus creating shocks and slowly declining post - interaction light curve ( see figure [ lcurve ] ) . the striking similarity of the late - time light curves of sn 1978k and 1987a again suggests the similar processes of interaction in the two sne although the time of the onsets may be different .",
    "the peak of sn 1987a interaction light curve occurred around day 8000 @xcite , or 22 years after the sn , while in sn 1978k it occurred after @xmath126 years , indicating a relatively closer csm concentration .",
    "this could further imply that the progenitor of sn 1978k changed its mass loss rate in a shorter timescale prior to the explosion compared to what sn 1987a progenitor did , assuming similar ejecta velocities and progenitor wind speeds .    in sn 1987a the shock propagates at @xmath12540 km s@xmath1 through",
    "the unshocked ( @xmath1210 km s@xmath1 ) circumstellar ring and accelerates the post - shock gas @xcite , resulting in typical line velocities of @xmath12300 km s@xmath1 @xcite in the shocked hot spots . in this regard",
    ", one may even speculate that the csm geometry in sn 1978k resembles the ring structure and the sn might be regarded as a more distant version of the sn 1987a remnant . suggested that the peak magnitude of sn 1978k as a type - iip or iil sn could have reached @xmath127 to @xmath128 mag , with the caveat that the 1978 light curve is very poorly sampled , thus it could have been a subluminous or even a non - terminal explosion .",
    "note that sn 1987a , now considered a peculiar type - ii sn , is also somewhat underluminous with peak @xmath129 mag @xcite .",
    "the emission of radiation from the sn 1987a ring is now decaying as the interaction proceeds to destroy it @xcite .",
    "the same process is possibly also happening in sn 1978k as the late - time light curve suggests .",
    "this corroborates the fact that the spectrum has changed very little in the last 20 years .",
    "observations of this object in the following years / decades may reveal the weakening and eventual disappearance of the emissions from the csm interaction .",
    "it would undoubtedly be interesting to resolve the remnant and csm of sn 1978k and compare it to sn 1987a , although such observational effort would only be possible to be achieved using interferometry or the next generation 30m - class telescopes operating at diffraction limit in the infrared .",
    "we present late - time optical spectroscopy of sn 1978k in ngc 1313 , obtained in 2007 and 2014 .",
    "the spectrum still exhibits strong narrow emission lines ( fwhm @xmath130 km s@xmath1 ) and has not changed much since the last published observations in the 1990s .",
    "we derive a progenitor mass loss rate of greater than 0.01 m@xmath3 yr@xmath1 and csm mass of less than @xmath12 1 m@xmath3 .",
    "emission line ratios suggest that the csm is more likely to be inhomogeneous , and the increasingly metal - rich inner ejecta is progressing to overtake the reverse shock .",
    "the late - time light curve suggests that the interaction between sn blastwave and the csm started around early to mid-1980s , and is currently decaying slowly .",
    "this behaviour is akin to sn 1987a , and the sn 1978k spectra are strikingly similar to that of sn 1987a at 26 years .",
    "we infer that sn 1978k is currently undergoing analogous process as sn 1987a in a similarly inhomogemeous circumstellar environment where csm interaction decays as the sn proceeds to evolve into a remnant .",

    "<S> we present new optical observations of the supernova sn 1978k , obtained in 2007 and 2014 with the very large telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we discover that the supernova has not faded significantly , even more than three decades after its explosion . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum exhibits numerous narrow ( fwhm @xmath0 km s@xmath1 ) emission lines , indicating that the supernova blastwave is persistently interacting with dense circumstellar material ( csm ) . </S>",
    "<S> evolution of emission lines indicates that the supernova ejecta is slowly progressing through the reverse shock , and has not expanded past the outer edge of the circumstellar envelope . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the csm is not likely to be spherically distributed , with mass of @xmath2 1 m@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the progenitor mass loss rate is estimated as @xmath4 m@xmath3 yr@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the slowly fading late - time light curve and spectra show striking similarity with sn 1987a , indicating that a rate at which the csm is being swept - up by the blastwave is gradually decaying and sn 1978k is undergoing similar evolution to become a remnant . due to its proximity ( 4  mpc ) , sn 1978k serves as the next best example of late - time supernova evolution after sn 1987a .    </S>",
