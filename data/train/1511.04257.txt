    "heterodyne holography @xcite is a technique firstly introduced 15 years ago realized by modifying a phase shifting holography setup @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of heterodyne holography is that the frequency , phase and amplitude of both reference and signal arms are controlled by acousto optic modulators ( aom ) . by shifting the frequency @xmath0 of the reference beam , called here local oscillator , with respect to the frequency @xmath1 of illumination , heterodyne holography is able to detect the light scattered by the object at any frequency @xmath2 close to @xmath0 , which can be equal or different than the frequency @xmath1 of illumination of the object .",
    "if the light is scattered by the object over a broad continuous frequency spectrum , heterodyne holography must be combined with off - axis holography in order to separate the images corresponding to the + 1 and -1 holographic grating orders .",
    "indeed , in that case , the + 1 and -1 holographic images are both non - zero , since they correspond to the detection of signals at frequencies that are different but very close and within the object broad frequency spectrum @xcite .",

    "the bandwidth bw of the detection is narrow ( 10 to 1000 hz depending on the camera ) , but the beat frequency @xmath3 can be large ( up to several mhz @xcite ) .",
    "heterodyne holography must be distinguished from optical scanning holography that uses a fast mono pixel detector ( photodiode ) , and that makes mechanical scans along the @xmath4 and @xmath5 axis to get holograms @xcite .",

    "this illustrates the coherent character of the detection .      since laser emission and photodetection on a camera pixel are random processes , the signal @xmath16 that is detected on each pixel exhibits shot noise .",
    "this noise is gaussian and its standard deviation @xmath115 is equal to @xmath116 , where @xmath16 is the pixel signal expressed in photo electron units ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "when performing heterodyne holography in dim light condition i.e. when @xmath118 the detection sensitivity is generally limited by the shot noise on the local oscillator , since @xmath119 .    to illustrate this point let us consider an example .",

    "on the other hand , the shot noise equivalent signal is 1 @xmath117 per pixel .",
    "indeed , if we consider a very low signal : @xmath126 @xmath117 , the + 1 grating order holographic term @xmath127 @xmath117 is equal to the shot noise variance @xmath128 @xmath117 .",
    "this result , which is valid for 1 frame , remains valid whatever the number of frames @xmath89 is .",
    "indeed , shot noise is a broadband white noise .",
    "the noise that is detected is thus proportional to the product of the total exposure time @xmath129 with the detection bandwidth bw , which is proportional to @xmath130 .",
    "the shot noise equivalent signal does not depend on the number of frames @xmath89 .",

    "as discussed above , the read noise and the quantization noise are lower than shot noise .",
    "the last extra noise that must be considered is the technical noise on the lo beam , because the lo signal is dominent since @xmath139 .",
    "this technical noise is the sum of the noises that differ from shot noise and that affect the lo beam signal .",
    "the noise on the power supply of main laser , the vibration of the setup , or the noise on the aoms or on the rf signal that drives the aoms contribute to technical noise .",
    "whatever its origin , the lo technical noise is highly correlated from pixel to the next , since the lo beam that reaches the camera is flat field ( @xmath140 varies slowly with position @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "it is thus possible to reach the shot noise limit by filtering the lo technical noise .",
    "a control holographic experiment made without signal ( i.e. with @xmath131 ) illustrates this filtering @xcite .",

    "with one frame ( a ) i.e. with @xmath35 , the lo signal @xmath141 , which is located in the center of the calculation grid , is brighter and extends over a larger area than with four frames i.e. with @xmath142 ( b ) .    to make a quantitative analysis of these images , we have plotted , on figs .

    "[ fig_fig_double_filtering ] ( c ) ) , the peak is much larger and much broader , than in the four frames case ( fig . [ fig_fig_double_filtering ] ( c ) ) .",

    "both signals are non zero because the spectrum is continuous .",
    "note that it is also possible to analyse the same data by making 2 phases detection with @xmath48 .",
    "in that case , @xmath62 is a real quantity and the + 1 and -1 images are both present too .",
    "the detected signal ( i.e. the brightness of slit images ) is low for the following reasons .    * most of the incoming illumination light is back reflected because the breast is highly diffusing . * the transmitted light is scattered in all directions and few light reach the camera . *",
    "the light that reach the camera is doppler broaden by the breast inner motions .",
    "since this doppler broadening is large with respect to the heterodyne detection bandwidth @xmath205 , most of the light that reach the camera is not detected .    to explore the doppler profile of the scattered photons , the frequency of the lo beam offset @xmath199 , was swept from 0 hz up to 5000 hz . to obtain a better signal , the 4 frames holograms @xmath141 have been averaged over 32 sequences of four frames .",
    "we have then measured the averaged signal within both the + 1 and -1 images of the slit , and compared this signal with the averaged signal in a quite zone of the fourier space , like the zone within the white circle in the right of fig .",
    "[ fig_fig_transp_27_imag_curve ] ( a ) .",
    "the signal , within the quite zone , corresponds to shot noise i.e. to 1 @xmath117 per pixel .",
    "we have plot , on fig .",
    "[ fig_fig_transp_27_imag_curve ] ( b ) ( curve 1 ) , the ratio of the averaged + 1 and -1 signal @xmath141 , versus the averaged signal within the quite zone , as a function of @xmath199 ( curve 1 ) . because of the ratio , the vertical scale is the averaged signal @xmath202 in photo electron units . in order to better visualise the background noise , we have also plotted on fig .",
    "[ fig_fig_transp_27_imag_curve ] ( b ) ( curve 2 ) , the ratio versus @xmath206 khz .",
    "since 100 khz is much larger than the half width of doppler spectrum ( about @xmath207 khz ) , curve 2 corresponds to the background noise , that is effectively equal to shot noise , i.e. , 1 @xmath117 .",
    "this last experiment shows how it is possible to explore a doppler spectrum by heterodyne holography .",
    "it illustrates also the sensitivity of doppler holography , since the signal that is analyzed is very low : @xmath202 very less than 0.05 @xmath117 at maximum .",
    "the doppler heterodyne holography method , that is illustrated here , has been used in many other contexts .",
    "the method has been used to detect the tagged photons in ultrasonic photon tagging experiments @xcite , to study brownian motion effects in coherent back scattering @xcite , and to image blood flow , in mouse crania @xcite , rat eye @xcite and fish embryo @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the digital heterodyne holography technique that is able to fully control the amplitude , phase and frequency of both illumination and reference beams .",
    "this control is made by acousto optic modulator , which are driven electronically by rf generators .",
    "heterodyne holography is an extremely versatile and powerful tool , able to perform automatic data acquisition in any holographic configuration with accurate phase and shot noise sensitivity .",
    "heterodyne holography is also able to perform the holographic detection at frequencies that are different than the illumination one .",
    "this capability is especially useful for vibration analysis , and for laser doppler full field measurement .",
