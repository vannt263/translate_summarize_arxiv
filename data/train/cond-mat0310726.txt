    "the subject of noise induced transport has attracted much theoretical as well as experimental interest for the past few years @xcite .",
    "the motivation for such a study stems from the challenge to develop models to explain the reliable unidirectional transport observed in biological systems amidst a very noisy environment in the absence of bias .",
    "systems that combine the asymmetry and nonequilibrium fluctuations to generate systematic motion in the absence of a macroscopic bias are termed as ratchets or brownian motors . in thermal equilibrium",
    "the principle of detailed balance prohibits any net particle current in the system .",
    "hence a net current in the absence of any bias can appear only as a consequence of the interaction of the particle with its noisy nonequilibrium environment .",
    "thus it is possible to extract energy from the random fluctuations and put it into use .",
    "these ratchet systems are information engines analogous to the maxwell s demon which extract work out of bath at the expense of an overall increase in entropy ( or entropy production ) @xcite .",
    "there are several ways in which one can incorporate nonequilibrium effects arising out of the irreversible interaction of the system with its external surroundings .",
    "this has led to various types of ratchets , namely , flashing ratchets , rocking ratchets , frictional ratchets , time asymmetric ratchets , etc @xcite .",
    "extensive studies have been carried out on the nature of current and their possible reversals as a function of various physical parameters .",
    "these studies are found to be useful in identifying proper models for biological motors and also to develop machines at the molecular scales including nanoparticle separation devices @xcite .",
    "the subject of the energetics of brownian motors or ratchets has developed into an entire subfield of its own right @xcite .",
    "a general framework has been developed wherein , the compatibility between the langevin and the fokker - planck formalisms used for various types of ratchets or motor models and the laws of thermodynamics have been proved @xcite . using this framework one can readily calculate various physical quantities like the efficiency of energy transduction , energy dissipation ( hysterisis loss ) , entropy ( entropy production ) , input energy , change in internal energy , work etc .",
    ", in systems far from linear response regime into the relam of nonequilibrium domain .",
    "some recent studies have also tried to reveal the relations between two completely unrelated phenomena , namely , stochastic resonance ( sr ) and brownian ratchets in a formal way through the consideration of fokker - planck equations @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the rate of flow of particles in a brownian ratchet is analogous to the rate of flow of information in the case of stochastic resonance .",
    "qian et al . have investigated a simple flashing ratchet model for ratchet effect as well as sr and have pointed out that the consistency between these two phenomena are just due to the existence of circular flux in nonequilibrium state @xcite .    in our present work",
    "we have analysed the nature of input energy ( energy loss ) and the total entropy production in a class of adiabatically rocked ratchets as a function of temperature of the bath ( or noise strength ) .",
    "these systems exhibit peak in the noise induced current ( in the absence of any net bias ) as a function of temperature .",
    "the question now arises as to whether this peak is related to the underlying resonance due to the synchronization of the position of the particle with the external drive induced by the noise .",
    "our analysis of input energy @xmath0 , rules out the presence of any resonance features in the dynamics of the position of the particle in these systems in the adiabatic regime .",
    "the presence of net currents in the ratchets increases the amount of known information about the system than otherwise .",
    "this extra bit of information comes from the negentropy or the physical information supplied by the external nonequilibrium bath .",
    "the amount of information transferred by the nonequilibrium bath is quantified in terms of algorithmic complexity .",
    "it has been argued that the algorithmic complexity or kolmogorov information entropy is maximum when the current is maximum @xcite . since",
    "the currents are generated at the expense of entropy we naively expect the maxmima in current to be related to the maxmima in the overall entropy production as a function of noise strength . however , we show that the maxima in current and the entropy production do not correlate with each other .",
    "we study the motion of an overdamped brownian particle in a potential @xmath1 subjected to a space dependent medium with friction coefficient @xmath2 and an external periodic force field @xmath3 at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the motion is described by the langevin equation @xcite @xmath5}^2 } } + { \\sqrt { \\frac { k_bt}{\\gamma(q ) } } } \\xi(t)\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a randomly fluctuating gaussian white noise with zero mean and correlation : @xmath7 .",
    "we take the potential @xmath1 to be periodic in space and is given by @xmath8 with the asymmetry parameter @xmath9 taking values between @xmath10 and @xmath11 . also , we take the friction coefficient @xmath2 to be periodic : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the phase difference with respect to @xmath1 and the coefficient @xmath14 takes values between @xmath15 and @xmath11 .",

    "this fact leads to the rectification of current in the presence of an applied ac field @xmath3 . in these inhomogeneous systems",
    "directed currents can be obtained even in a spatially periodic symmetric potential .",
    "the inversion symmetry in these systems being broken dynamically by the space dependent frictional coefficient which is periodic in space having a phase lag of @xmath13 with the potential profile . in the second case where @xmath27 ( purely homogeneous case )",
    "the net currents are generated due to the spatial asymmetry of the potential ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 changes slowly enough ( adiabatic regime ) , i.e. , its frequency is smaller than any other frequency related to the relaxation rate in the problem such that the system is in a steady state at each instant of time . for a field @xmath3 of a square wave of amplitude @xmath29 ,",
    "an average current over the period of oscillation is given by , @xmath30 $ ] @xcite .",
    "in the quasi static limit following the method of stochastic energetics it can be shown @xcite that the input energy @xmath0 ( per unit time ) is given by @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "we also consider another type of ratchet , namely , the time asymmetric ratchets @xcite where the driving force has zero mean , @xmath32 , but is asymmetric in time i.e. , @xmath33 the time averaged current in this case is given by @xmath34 with @xmath35 the input energy @xmath0 per unit time for this time asymmetric ratchet is given by @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "for the case where @xmath37 and @xmath38 the currents are generated in the absence of broken spatial symmetry , but in the presence of a temporal asymmetric driving with zero mean .",
    "this type of temporal asymmetry is particularly common in biological systems @xcite .",
    ".    in the following we analyse all these special classes of adiabatic ratchets mentioned above and also their combinations .",
    "we study the average current @xmath39 , the total entropy production @xmath40 , and the energy loss @xmath41 as a function of temperature @xmath4 ( noise strength ) for seven different cases of adiabatically rocked ratchet systems described below .",
    "all these quantities are averaged over the period of external drive and are in appropriate dimensionless units .",
    "it has been argued that for the case of a driven double well system input energy is a reliable quantity for the identification of sr taking into account the detailed comparison between various measures of sr @xcite .",
    "further analysis based on input energy has shown the sr to be a bonafide resonance @xcite in that one obtaines peak in the input energy as a function of noise strength as well as the frequency of the external drive @xcite .",
    "thus the peak in the input energy represents the matching condition of the escape rate out of the potential well ( or synchonization in the dynamics of the particle ) and the external driving frequency .",
    "it should be noted that as the system on the average does not perform any useful work the input energy in the steady state equals the energy loss ( hysterisis loss ) in the medium .",
    "hysterisis loss being a good measure to identify sr is already known in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is quite natural that when the system dynamics exhibits a resonance feature ( or a peak ) by tuning certain physical parameters , then at resonance the input energy extracted from the source ( and the concomittant energy loss in the medium ) is expected to be high .",
    "thus the study of input energy or energy loss is expected to reveal the resonances if any in the dynamics of the particle as a function of various physical parameters .    in our present work",
    "the particle performs a motion in a periodic potential in the presence of an adiabatic drive . as there is no load applied to the system",
    ", the system does not perform any useful work or stores energy and as a result all the input energy in the steady state will be dissipated away .",
    "hence the energy loss in the medium is given by @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath41 inturn is equal to the heat @xmath43 transferred to the bath and thus entropy production @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "thus the total increase in the entropy ( or the entropy production ) of the bath ( universe ) integrated over the period of the external drive is given by @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , currents in the ratchet systems are generated at the expense of entropy and thus we expect a correlation between the magnitude of current and the total entropy production .    in figures 1 to 7 we have plotted energy loss @xmath41 ( equal to input energy ) , average current @xmath39 and entropy production @xmath40 as a function of temperature @xmath4 for various types of adiabatically driven ratchet systems .",
    "all the physical parameters are in dimensionless units and their values are mentioned in the figure caption .",
    "all these figures are representative of the different classes of ratchet systems chosen to make our analysis clear .    figures 1,2 and 3 correspond to the spatially asymmetric case @xmath46 ; inhomogeneous case @xmath47 and temporal asymmetric case @xmath48 respectively . in each case currents",
    "are generated via different types of mechanisms arising out of spatial asymmetry in the potential or frictional inhomogenity or temporal asymmetry of the external force . here",
    "nonlinearity of the system , external drive and asymmetry conspire to generate unidirectional currents in the absence of any bias . in all these figures ( 1 to 3 )",
    "current exhibits a single peak as a function of temperature .",
    "the input energy being a monotonically increasing function of @xmath4 rules out any resonance in the dynamics of the particle as a function of noise strength as discussed earlier .",
    "entropy production exhibits a single peak as a function of noise strength .",
    "moreover , the peak in the average current , @xmath39 and total entropy production @xmath40 does not occur at the same @xmath4 .",
    "this clearly indicates that maxima in the entropy production does not take place at the same value where current is maximum . to make this point explicit in figures 4,5 and 6",
    "we have plotted @xmath49 and @xmath50 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "they correspond to a combination of spatial asymmetry and system inhomogenity @xmath51 ; system inhomogenity and temporal inhomogenity @xmath52 and temporal asymmetry and spatial asymmetry @xmath53 respectively . all these figures from 4 to 6 exhibit the phenomena of single current reversal or the absolute magnitude of current exhibits two peaks .",
    "however , the entropy production exhibits only a single maxima as a function of noise strength .",
    "this rules out clearly any correlation between current maxima and the maxima in the entropy production .",
    "the behaviour of input energy rules out any resonance phenomena in these systems as well .    in fig",
    ". 7 we plotted @xmath54 and @xmath40 for a system which incorporates frictional inhomogenity , temporal asymmetry as well as spatial asymmetry .",
    "the system with all these combinations exhibit rich variety in the nature of current as a function of various physical parameters and moreover in some parameter region large efficiency of energy transduction is observed @xcite . for parameters given in fig .",
    "7 the current exhibits two reversals as a function of @xmath4 . our observation of double current reversal in the adiabatic regime is in itself a novel phenomena . the absolute magnitude of current exhibits three peaks as against to the single peak structure in entropy production .",
    "this again reinforces the fact that maxima in the entropy production and current are totally unrelated .",
    "the behaviour of input energy again rules out the resonance dynamics in the system .    in conclusion , by considering different cases of adiabatically rocked ratchets",
    "we have shown that the resonance like feature observed in the nature of current as a function of temperature or the noise strength is not related to the intrinsic resonance in the dynamics of the particle and that the total entropy production does not extremize at the same parameter value at which the current exhibits a maximum .",
    "our present results are valid only for the case of an adiabatically rocked thermal ratchet .",
    "this does not rule out the resonance in the dynamics of the particle in the nonadiabatic regimes as well as in other ratchet systems like flashing ratchets considered earlier @xcite .",
    "the fact that the noise strength at which the current maxima and the maxima in entropy production occurs do not coincide may be related to the quality of the current .",
    "noise induced currents are always associated with a dispersion or diffusion . when the diffusion is large then the quality of transport degrades and the coherence in the unidirectional motion",
    "the coherent transport ( optimal transport ) refers to the case of large mean velocity at fairly small diffusion .",
    "it can be quantified @xcite by a dimensionless pelet number . for",
    "a given magnitude of current transport may be coherent or incoherent .",
    "thus analysis of the relation between current and the entropy production requires not only the magnitude of current but also the quality of transport .",
    "it is also shown that the algorithmic complexity or the kolmogorov information entropy of the thermal ratchet motion exhibits maxima at the same value at which current is maximum @xcite .",
    "it will be of interest to see multiple maxima in algorithmic complexity as a function of system parameter in a multiple current reversal regime .",
    "these studies are expected to reveal a deep connection between efficiency , quality of transport , entropy and information .",
    "works along these different directions are in progress .",
