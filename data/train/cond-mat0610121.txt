    "studies of quantum phase transitions are currently of great interest as they provide important insights into a wide variety of many - body systems @xcite . the pioneering observation of the superfluid ( sf ) to mott insulator ( mi ) transition in an optical lattice using cold bosonic atoms @xcite , which had been predicted by jaksch et .",
    "@xcite , highlights the exquisite control of the inter atomic interactions that is possible in such systems . in that experiment ,",
    "performed using @xmath0 atoms , the tunneling of the atoms to neighboring sites and also the strength of the on - site interactions were controlled by tuning and/or detuning the laser intensity in order to achieve the transition from the sf phase ( random distribution of atoms ) to the mi phase where there are a fixed number of atoms per site @xcite .",
    "recent developments involving the manipulation of ultracold atoms have led to the realization of genuine one dimensional systems such as the tonks - girardeau gas  @xcite .",
    "several interesting phenomena including the sf - mi transition have been observed in one - dimensional optical lattices  @xcite .    in the past few years , on the theoretical side , many investigations have been carried out using a single species of bosonic atoms in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "recently cold bosonic mixtures  @xcite , fermions  @xcite and bose - fermi mixtures  @xcite in optical lattices have attracted much attention .",
    "mixtures of different species are very interesting since additional phases could appear due to the inter - species interactions  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider a system with two species of bosonic atoms or equivalently , bosonic atoms with two relevant internal states .",
    "the two species shall be called @xmath1 and @xmath2 type respectively .",
    "the low - energy hamiltonian is then given by the bose - hubbard model for the two boson species : @xmath3 here @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is bosonic annihilation operator for bosonic atoms of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) type localized on site @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are the number operators .",
    "@xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are the hopping amplitudes between adjacent sites @xmath13 and the on - site intra - species repulsive energies , respectively for @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) type of atom .",
    "the inter - species interaction is given by @xmath14 .",
    "the hopping amplitudes ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) and interaction parameters ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath14 ) are related to depth of optical potential , recoil energy and the scattering lengths .",
    "the ratio @xmath17 can be controlled to a wide range of values  @xcite experimentally . in this work",
    "we consider inter - exchange symmetry @xmath18 , implying @xmath19 and @xmath20 and study the effect of inter - species interaction on the ground state of model([eq : ham ] ) in one - dimension .",
    "we set our energy scale by @xmath21 .",
    "the model  ( [ eq : ham ] ) has been studied earlier using the mean field  @xcite , monte - carlo  @xcite and the bosonization methods  @xcite and this has resulted in the prediction of the basic structure of its ground state phase diagram .",
    "the bosonization study predicts phase separation ( ps ) for large values of the inter - species interaction @xmath14 by considering one species of bosons to be hard core and the other to be in the intermediate to hard core regime  @xcite .",
    "phase separation has also been found using a variational method based on the multi orbital best mean field ansatz @xcite .",
    "however , a clear picture of the transitions pertaining to the sf , mi and ps phases has not emerged so far . in order to achieve this , we consider the influence of the inter - species interaction @xmath14 on these phases , by carrying out a systematic study of its effect on the ground state of model  ( [ eq : ham ] ) in one - dimension using the finite size density matrix renormalization method  @xcite .",
    "the following part of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii contains the details of our finite size density matrix renormalization method .",
    "section iii contains our results .",
    "we end with concluding remarks in section iv .",
    "the finite - size density - matrix renormalization group ( fsdmrg ) method has proven to be very useful in studies of one - dimensional quantum systems@xcite . the details of this method are given in a recent review by schollw@xmath22ck  @xcite .",
    "the open boundary condition is preferred over periodic boundary condition for this method because the loss of accuracy which increases with the size of the system is much less in the former than the latter . in the conventional fsdmrg method , the lattice is first built to the desired length ( @xmath23 ) using the infinite system density - matrix renormalization method ( dmrg ) .",
    "the finite size sweeping is done only for this desired lattice size @xmath23 .",
    "we use a slightly modified form of the fsdmrg , where we sweep at _ every step _ of the procedure and not just for the case which corresponds to the largest value of @xmath23 .",
    "this enables one to obtain accurate correlation functions .",
    "furthermore , since the superfluid phase in models such as eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) , in @xmath24 and at @xmath25 , is critical and has a correlation length that diverges with the system size @xmath23 , finite - size effects must be eliminated by using finite - size scaling as we show later . for this purpose , the energies and the correlation functions , obtained from a dmrg calculation , should converge satisfactorily for each system size @xmath23 .",
    "it is important , therefore , that we use the fsdmrg method as opposed to the infinite - system dmrg method especially in the vicinities of continuous phase transitions .    in the fsdmrg method",
    "the bases used for left- and right - block hamiltonians are truncated by neglecting the eigenstates of the density matrix corresponding to small eigenvalues which leads to truncation errors .",
    "if we retain @xmath26 states , the density - matrix weight of the discarded states is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are the eigenvalues of density matrix .",
    "@xmath29 provides a convenient measure of the truncation errors .",
    "we find that these errors depend on the order - parameter and correlation length for a given phase .",
    "for a fixed @xmath26 , we find very small truncation errors in the gapped phase and the truncation errors are largest for the sf phase . in our calculations",
    "we choose @xmath26 such that the truncation error is always less than @xmath30 and we find that @xmath31 suffices .",
    "the number of possible states per site in the model([eq : ham ] ) is infinite since there can be any number of @xmath1 and @xmath2 species bosons on a site . in a practical fsdmrg calculation",
    "we must truncate the number of states @xmath32 allowed per site .",
    "the value of @xmath32 , of course , will depend on the on - site interaction @xmath33 .",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath33 the larger must be @xmath32 . from our earlier calculation@xcite on related models , we find that @xmath34 is sufficient for the value of @xmath33 considered here .",
    "this implies , for model([eq : ham ] ) , @xmath35 states each per site for @xmath1 and @xmath2 species bosons and a total of @xmath36 states per site .",
    "this corresponds to a truncation of bases of left ( right ) block from @xmath37 to @xmath26 in each fsdmrg iteration .    before proceeding",
    "further we give a brief summary of our results .",
    "the various parameters that we calculate to study the ground state properties of model  ( [ eq : ham ] ) are the energy gap @xmath38 , which is the difference between the energies needed to add and remove one atom from a system of atoms , i.e .",
    ", @xmath39 and the on - site density correlation function @xmath40 here @xmath41 , is an index representing type @xmath1 or @xmath2 bosons , @xmath42 is the ground - state energy for a system of size @xmath23 with @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) number of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) type bosons and @xmath45 is the corresponding ground - state wavefunction , which are obtained by the fsdmrg method . in @xmath24 , the appearance of the mi phase is signaled by the opening up of the gap @xmath46 .",
    "however , @xmath47 is finite for finite systems and we must extrapolate to the @xmath48 limit , which is best done by using finite - size scaling  @xcite . in the critical region ,",
    "i.e. , sf region , the gap @xmath49 where the scaling function @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the correlation length .",
    "@xmath52 in the sf region .",
    "thus plots of @xmath53 versus @xmath33 , for different system sizes @xmath23 , consist of curves that intersect at the critical point at which the correlation length for @xmath54 diverges and gap @xmath55 vanishes .    defining the ratio of the inter and intra species interactions @xmath56 , we study the ground state of model  ( [ eq : ham ] ) for @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the ground state exhibits some similarities as well as differences in each of the cases .",
    "when the kinetic energy is the dominant term in the model , the ground state is in 2sf ( both @xmath1 and @xmath2 species are in the sf phase ) state for all @xmath60 .",
    "this similarity is , however , lost when the interactions dominate . for @xmath61 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath62 , the large @xmath33 phase is mott insulator with non - zero energy gap in the ground state .",
    "this state has an uniform local density of bosons for each species , i.e. , @xmath63 for all @xmath6 .",
    "the 2sf to mi transition is possible only when the total density @xmath64 is an integer . for @xmath65 , the 2sf - mi transition for model  ( [ eq : ham ] )",
    "is similar to the sf - mi transition for single species bosons with the same density of bosons . for @xmath66 and for small values of @xmath33 ,",
    "the ground state is a 2sf state .",
    "however , when @xmath33 increases , the ground state first goes into superfluid phase with @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons spatially separated into different regions of the lattice .",
    "this is the case when @xmath67 .",
    "this phase may be called the phase separated superfluid(ps - sf ) .",
    "there is no gap in the ground state energy spectrum and the phase separation order parameter defined as @xmath68 is non - zero . a further increase in @xmath33 results in opening up of the gap in the energy spectrum .",
    "this mott insulator has a non - zero phase separation order parameter and it may be called the phase separated mott - insulator(ps - mi ) .",
    "the total local density @xmath69 remain uniform across the lattice . when the densities are different , for example @xmath70 , @xmath71 , no ps - mi is found and the ground state has only 2sf and ps - sf phases .",
    "when @xmath70 , @xmath72 we find , for @xmath73 , no ps - sf phase and the transition is directly from 2sf to ps - mi .",
    "we now present the details of our results .",
    "in the absence of the inter - species interaction @xmath14 , model ( [ eq : ham ] ) is an independent mixture of the individual species of bosons .",
    "so the nature of the ground state of model ( [ eq : ham ] ) depends only on the density of the individual species of bosons : @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath20 , the on - site interactions .",
    "for example , if @xmath76 , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is an integer , the ground state is always in the superfluid phase irrespective of the strength of the on - site interaction @xmath33 .",
    "the mott insulator is possible only when either @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "based on the values of @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath33 , the ground state is categorized as 2sf(both @xmath1 and @xmath2 type bosons in sf phase ) , sf+mi(@xmath1 boson in sf and @xmath2 in mi phase or vice - versa ) and mi+mi(both @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons in mi phase ) . for @xmath76 , @xmath77 or for any values of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , but @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the critical on - site interaction for sf to mi transition , the ground state is always in the 2sf phase .",
    "sf+mi phase is possible for @xmath76 , @xmath80 ( or vice - versa ) and @xmath83 .",
    "if both @xmath84 and @xmath83 , we have mi+mi phase . in order to investigate the influence of @xmath14 on these ground states , we consider three cases : @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath85 , where @xmath56 . in each of these three cases ,",
    "we consider three different ranges of densities:(i ) @xmath67 , ( ii ) @xmath86 , ( iii ) @xmath87 .",
    "the choice of these three cases are made to understand the effect of the inter - species interaction on 2sf , sf+mi and mi+mi phases .",
    "we now discuss each case below .",
    "( i)@xmath67 : + as discussed in the previous paragraph , for this case , there is no mi phase if @xmath88 and the model ( [ eq : ham ] ) will have only the 2sf phase .",
    "however , with the introduction of inter - species interaction , the 2sf phase is destroyed .",
    "for example , figure  ( [ fig : fig1 ] ) shows a plot of scaling of gap @xmath53 versus @xmath33 for @xmath58 .",
    "curves for different values of @xmath23 coalesce for @xmath89 indicating a gapped mi phase for @xmath90 . the emergence of this phase is due to the intra - species as well as interspecies interaction strengths . the fact that @xmath91 , indicates that the model ( [ eq : ham ] ) when @xmath92 behaves like a single species of bosons at unit density  @xcite .",
    "these results are along the expected lines because , when @xmath93 , every boson in the system interacts with rest of bosons , irrespective of whether they are of type @xmath1 or @xmath2 , with the same strength and therefore the species index become irrelevant .",
    "however , the situation changes when the inter - species interaction @xmath94 .    for @xmath57 , i.e",
    ", @xmath95 , the system still undergoes 2sf - mi transition when the on - site repulsion increases , but with a higher @xmath82 . for example figure  ( [ fig : fig2 ] ) shows a plot of scaling of gap @xmath53 versus @xmath33 for @xmath96 .",
    "the critical @xmath97 is substantially greater than @xmath98 .",
    "the ground state of the model([eq : ham ] ) for @xmath67 , @xmath99 consists only of 2sf and mi phases .",
    "the transition from 2sf to mi is of kosterlitz - thouless - type .    when @xmath66 , the scenario is drastically different from the one seen above .",
    "the on - site densities @xmath100 and @xmath101 are plotted in fig .",
    "( [ fig : fig3 ] ) for @xmath102 .",
    "it is clear from this figure that there is a spatial separation between the two different species of bosons for @xmath103 and no spatial separation for @xmath104 .",
    "this highlights a _ phase separation _",
    "( ps ) transition as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "the question then arises whether this spatially separated phase is a superfluid or a mott insulator . in order to sort this out , we plot both the scaling of the gap @xmath53 and the order parameter @xmath105 for phase separation in fig .",
    "( [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "it is evident from these figures that the transition to the mi phase happens at around @xmath106 and to the spatially separated phase around @xmath107 .",
    "the gap remains zero for @xmath108 .",
    "thus for the case @xmath67 and @xmath102 , there are three phases : the superfluid phase ( 2sf ) for @xmath109 , superfluid , but phase separated ( ps - sf ) for @xmath108 and finally mott insulator , but again phase separated ( ps - mi ) for @xmath110 .",
    "it should be noted that the total density of bosons @xmath64 remain constant through out the lattice , though bosons are space separated .",
    "the critical values of 2sf to ps - sf and ps - sf to ps - mi transition depends of the on the value of @xmath60 . the detailed phase diagram in the @xmath111 plane and the nature of the different phase transitions will be reported elsewhere .",
    "( ii)@xmath86 : + in this case , when @xmath88 species @xmath1 bosons undergo a superfluid to mott insulator transition at @xmath112 by virtue of having density @xmath70 , while the @xmath2 bosons , which has density @xmath71 , remains in the superfluid phase . however , when @xmath113 , no transition from sf to mi was found for either of the two species of bosons . the mott insulator phase of @xmath1 bosons is completely lost . in the fig .",
    "( [ fig : fig5](a ) ) , we plot the length dependence of gap @xmath38 for different @xmath33 , which clearly indicates that the gap vanishes at @xmath48 for all values of @xmath33 considered .",
    "this emphasizes the fact that as far as the transition to the mott insulator is concerned , when @xmath114 , the total density must be an integer irrespective of the densities of the individual species of bosons ; and it is this condition that really matters .",
    "this condition remains same for @xmath115 .",
    "thus when the inter - species interaction is non zero as in the present case and the total density @xmath116 , no mott insulator phase is observed .",
    "the phase separation , however , happens when @xmath115 .",
    "the local density distribution of different species of bosons are given in fig .",
    "( [ fig : fig5](b ) ) for @xmath117 and @xmath102 . for @xmath104",
    ", we find no phase separation , however , for @xmath103 , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 species bosons are phase separated .",
    "they rearrange in such a manner that the total density @xmath64 remains a constant .",
    "for example , when @xmath70 and @xmath71 , one - third of the region is occupied by the species @xmath2 and two - third by the species @xmath1 . the total density @xmath118 being @xmath119 , the distributions of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 types of bosons follow the ratio of their densities .",
    "( iii)@xmath120 : + finally we consider double commensurate case where both the species of bosons undergo sf to mi phase transition in the absence of @xmath14 .",
    "it may be noted that for @xmath87 , @xmath121 for @xmath88 . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : fig6 ] ) , we plot the scaling of the gap @xmath53 for @xmath122 . from this figure and from similar ones for @xmath61 i.e. , @xmath62 , we find that the transition from 2sf to mi occurs at a much higher value of @xmath123 .",
    "no sf - mi transition observed at @xmath124 . due to the collective intra and inter species interactions in model  ( [ eq : ham ] ) , the species index become irrelevant for the phase transition . for @xmath125 ,",
    "the phase transition from 2sf to mi is similar to the sf - mi transition in single species bosons with density @xmath126 .",
    "this is consistent with the similar observations made for the case of @xmath67 .",
    "the phase separation transition , however , occurs for @xmath127 as given in the fig .",
    "( [ fig : fig7 ] ) . in this case",
    "the transitions to phase separation and to the mott insulator occur around same @xmath128 .",
    "in other words we did not find a ps - sf phase sandwiched between 2sf and ps - mi for this case .",
    "we have studied the ground state of a two species bose mixture in one dimension using the finite - size density - matrix renormalization group method .",
    "we have considered three sets of densities @xmath129 . analyzing the scaling of gap in the energy spectrum and the order parameter for phase separation we have obtained several phases : 2sf , mi , ps - sf and ps - mi . for @xmath130 , the mott insulator phase is possible only when the total density @xmath131 , is an integer .",
    "the superfluid to mott insulator transition in model  ( [ eq : ham ] ) is then similar to the single species bose - hubbard model with the same total density @xmath118 .",
    "the critical on - site interaction for the 2sf - mi transition , however , depends on the values of @xmath60 .",
    "the lower the value of @xmath60 , the larger the value of @xmath82 . for @xmath116 , mott insulator phase is not found .",
    "phase separation occurs for @xmath115 irrespective of the value of density . for @xmath132 and for all the values of @xmath60 that we have considered , we found phase separated mott insulator phase . in the case of @xmath67 ,",
    "we observe a phase separated superfluid ps - sf sandwiched between 2sf and ps - mi .",
    "however , for @xmath87 , no ps - sf was found and the transition is directly from 2sf to ps - mi .",
    "for @xmath133 we found a transition from 2sf to ps - sf for @xmath66 and only 2sf phase for @xmath61 .",
    "it would indeed be worthwhile to devise experiments to test our findings .",
