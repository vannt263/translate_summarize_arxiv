    "the feeps have a length of 2 cm , a diameter of 4 mm , and weigh only several grams sufficient for the entire mission .",
    "a continuous thrust of @xmath102 per thruster is available . for a satellite diameter of about 1.5 m ( the maximum asap 5 size ) , the solar radiation pressure of ca . @xmath103 and the radiation pressure of the earth albedo of @xmath104 sum up to a total drag of about @xmath105 .",
    "considering thruster noise , misalignments and other disturbing effects , a continuous thrust of @xmath106 would be sufficient .",
    "to control all 6 degrees of freedom a minimum of 3 clusters of 4 thrusters is necessary . to guarantee a continuous thrust with some redundancy 4 clusters are desirable .",
    "the power consumption is less than 3 w on average with peaks up to 25 w.",
    "the proposed optis mission is capable to make considerable improvements , up to three orders of magnitude , in the tests of sr and gr .",
    "it is designed to be a low cost mission .",
    "it is based on using ( i ) recent laboratory developments in optical technology and ( ii ) the advantages of space conditions : quit environment , long integration time , large velocities and large potential differences .",
    "the optical technology includes an optical comb generator , stabilized lasers and highly stable cavities .",
    "we remark that an alternative optical cavity system consisting of a monolithic silicon block operated at @xmath107 , the temperature where the thermal expansion coefficient vanishes , should be studied @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this approach could be a significantly reduced level of creep and therefore a corresponding improvement of the kt test ."
