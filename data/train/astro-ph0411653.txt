    "the aim of the present paper is to develop the first comprehensive model of the physical , chemical , and dynamical structure of the circumstellar matter orbiting around an intermediate - mass herbig ae star based on available observations .",
    "we focus on ab aur , which is one of the nearest and best - studied object among the entire class of the herbig ae stars .",
    "the ab aur system consists of a pre - main - sequence ( pms ) star with spectral type a0ve+sh ( mass @xmath15 , radius @xmath16 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) located at a distance of @xmath17  pc @xcite , which is surrounded by a @xmath18  au rotating circumstellar disk @xcite and an extended ( @xmath19  au ) envelope @xcite . as it is a pms object ,",
    "the age of ab aur can be roughly estimated by using evolutionary track modeling , giving a value of @xmath20 - 5  myr @xcite .",
    "one of the long - standing mysteries that is related to this object is the value of the disk inclination angle . @xcite",

    "near - infrared ( nir ) interferometric observations by @xcite have revealed that the ab aur system looks nearly spherically - symmetric at @xmath24  au scale , implying that the inclination angle is close to @xmath25 ( `` face - on '' ) .",

    "a similar value of @xmath30 has been used by @xcite , who have successfully fitted the ab aur sed by a flared disk model with a puffed - up inner rim .",
    "obviously , there is a general disagreement regarding the disk orientation observed with ir- and mm - interferometers or derived from the sed modeling , though more recent studies point to a face - on configuration .",
    "a combination of high - quality observational data and appropriate theoretical modeling would allow to determine precisely , among many other parameters , the orientation of the ab aur system .    in this paper , we report on the results of our observations at millimeter wavelengths and modeling of the ab aur system .",
    "the object was observed at low resolution ( @xmath31-@xmath32 ) using the iram 30-m antenna between 2000 and 2001 and at a higher @xmath33 resolution in the hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) line with the iram _ plateau de bure interferometer _ ( pdbi ) in 2002 .",
    "about a dozen rotational transitions of co , c@xmath0o , cs , hcn , hnc , hco@xmath1 , dco@xmath1 , sio , and h@xmath2co were detected with the iram 30-m telescope .",
    "these single - dish and interferometric data as well as supplementary data from the literature form the observational basis for our study .",
    "first , we simulate the time - dependent chemical evolution of the ab aur system using a gas - grain chemical network and assuming a two - component model of a flared passive accretion disk enshrouded in a diffuse spherical envelope .",
    "second , we apply a 2d non - lte line radiative transfer code to translate the calculated molecular abundances of cs , co , and hco@xmath1 to the corresponding synthetic beam - convolved single - dish and interferometric spectra .",
    "next , we compare the observed and synthesized emission lines in a systematic way in order to determine the model parameters consequently , each after another .",
    "iterating these three stages of the modeling , we find the best - fit model of the ab aur disk and envelope and estimate uncertainties of the constrained parameters .",
    "our primary intention is to verify the strength of such an advanced theoretical approach to account for various observed interferometric and single - dish molecular spectra _",
    "simultaneously_. as a by - product of this study , many important parameters describing the physical , chemical , and dynamical structure of the ab aur system can be constrained _ independently _ from other investigations performed so far .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ obs ] we describe our single - dish and interferometric millimeter observations of ab aur with the pdbi array and iram 30-m antenna .",
    "the relevant physical and chemical models of the disk and envelope are presented and discussed in sect .",

    "[ res ] . in this section",
    ", we also discuss how parameters of the best - fit model and their uncertainties are constrained , and what the evolutionary status and lifetime of the ab aur system are .",
    "a summary and final conclusions follow in sect .",
    "the observations of ab aur with the iram 30-m dish were performed during two runs in september 2000 and october 2001 .",
    "we measured several spectral line settings at the following sky position : + @xmath34 = 04@xmath35 55@xmath36 45@xmath37.8 , + @xmath38 = @xmath39 33@xmath40 04@xmath41.3 .",
    "the observations were carried out with all four receivers , a , b , c , d as the frontends and the autocorrelator as the backend .",
    "we used the autocorrelator split into different subbands with resolution between 20  khz and 80  khz , depending on the presence of ( hyper- ) fine structure in the transition under investigation . during the first run ,",
    "the data were obtained applying both the beam wobbling mode with a beamthrow of 240@xmath41 and the frequency switching mode with a frequency shift of 5  mhz .",
    "it turned out that at the position 240@xmath41 away from the center the emission from the nearby remnant nebulosity is still strong enough to contaminate the observations .",
    "therefore , during the second set of observations , the same frequency switching and a position switching with a larger @xmath42 offset position were used .",
    "the typical spectral resolution was about 0.2  kms@xmath43 .",
    "the total integration time varied between 5  min for co and @xmath44  min for hcn , depending on the signal strength .",
    "the pointing of the instrument was checked about every @xmath45 hour , which resulted in a typical error of @xmath46 . in the case of several measurements of a particular molecular transition with the on - off and frequency switching techniques",
    ", we relied always on that which had the highest signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the chopper - wheel method was applied to calibrate the spectra in units of the antenna temperature @xmath47 . to reduce all spectroscopic data ,",
    "the standard gildas software package was used .",
    "we summarize all single - dish detections in table  [ lines ] . in total , nine different molecular species were detected : co , c@xmath0o , cs , hco@xmath1 , dco@xmath1 , h@xmath2co , hcn , hnc , and sio .",
    "the observed intensities ( mjy ) were converted to the antenna temperatures ( kelvin ) and afterwards to the main beam temperatures : @xmath48 = @xmath49 .",
    "the beam efficiency values , @xmath50 , were taken from the iram newsletter , n.  18 , 1994 ( see also table  [ lines ] , col .",
    "in addition , the following spectral lines were only marginally detected ( with @xmath51 sigma ) : cn(@xmath52=3/2 - 1/2 ,  @xmath53=5/2 - 3/2 ) , h@xmath2co(@xmath54=@xmath55-@xmath56 ) , and h@xmath2co(@xmath54=@xmath57-@xmath58 ) .",
    "other observationally interesting lines , like hc@xmath59n(@xmath52=10 - 9 ) , n@xmath2h@xmath1(@xmath52=1 - 0 ) , c@xmath2h(@xmath52=3/2 - 1/2 ) , ch@xmath59oh(@xmath54=@xmath60-@xmath61 ) , and ch@xmath59cn(@xmath52=5 - 4 ,  @xmath62=0 ) were not detected at all .",
    "spectra of firmly detected lines are shown in fig .",
    "as can be clearly seen , they basically exhibit three different types of line profiles . the co(2 - 1 ) , c@xmath0o(2 - 1 )",
    ", hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) , and cs(2 - 1 ) lines are single - peaked , centered at the system velocity ( @xmath63  kms@xmath43 ) , and narrow , @xmath64  kms@xmath43 ( except for co(2 - 1 ) which is broader than @xmath65  kms@xmath43 ) .",
    "in contrast , the hcn(1 - 0 ,  @xmath53=2 - 1 ) and hnc(1 - 0 ) line profiles are slightly broader and apparently have a more complicated asymmetric structure .",
    "furthermore , hco@xmath1(2 - 1 ) , hco@xmath1(3 - 2 ) , dco@xmath1(2 - 1 ) , cs(5 - 4 ) , and h@xmath2co(3@xmath66 - 2@xmath67 ) spectra show a narrow single - peaked shape and a blueshift up to @xmath68  kms@xmath43 from the system velocity , whereas sio(2 - 1 ,  @xmath690 ) has a @xmath70  kms@xmath43 redshift .",
    "the reason for such a diversity in the observed line profiles is not completely understood .",
    "we suppose that the blueshifted single lines could actually be broad double - peaked asymmetric spectra , with their less intense redshifted wings being lost in the noise . as we show below , all these lines but co(2 - 1 ) are optically thin and their double - peaked appearance",
    "would imply that they trace mainly the rotating ab aur disk but not much of the quiescent envelope material , whereas the asymmetry of the line profiles can be explained by the @xmath71 pointing errors of the iram 30-m antenna during the measurements .",
    "this idea is partly confirmed by the fact that some of these spectra , like hco@xmath1(3 - 2 ) and cs(5 - 4 ) , require high densities for the excitation and were measured with small beam sizes of about @xmath72 ( which is comparable with the @xmath73 disk ) .",
    "on the other hand , the iram beam for the hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) and cs(2 - 1 ) lines is @xmath74 , a few times larger than the apparent disk size , and due to a significant beam dilution in this case , both emission lines come from the extended envelope around ab aur . this suggestion is further supported by the narrow @xmath24  kms@xmath43 width and central position of these emission lines , typical of cool and quiet gas .",
    "this is certainly true also for the co(2 - 1 ) and c@xmath0o(2 - 1 ) lines , though the broad width of the former spectrum indicates that the co(2 - 1 ) emission is contaminated by moving gas along the line of sight to ab aur .",
    "we find strong evidence for a large reservoir of cold gas located within @xmath75 around the central star that is indirectly probed by our dco@xmath1(2 - 1 ) measurements ( see table  [ lines ] , footnote `` c ) '' ) .",
    "the negative intensity of this line was detected only in the case of the on - off observations , which can be easily explained .",
    "it is known that deuterium fractionation proceeds most efficiently in cold environments , @xmath76  k , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but not in the inner ( warm ) parts of protoplanetary disks ( see * ?",
    "consequently , the dco@xmath1(2 - 1 ) signal is stronger for the cold outer region of the envelope at a distance of @xmath77  au ( @xmath78 offset ) than for the warm inner @xmath79  au part ( @xmath80 iram beam ) .",
    "therefore , the measured intensity of this emission line became negative after the on - off subtraction of the strong background signal .",
    "note that the hcn(1 - 0 ,  @xmath53=2 - 1 ) single - peaked asymmetrical spectrum was observed with the same @xmath78 beam wobbling technique and may suffer from a similar contamination .",
    "it is worth to mention that an extended @xmath77  au region of thermal emission from cold dust grains around ab aur has been observed by the _",
    "iras _ satellite at @xmath81 m @xcite .",
    "we mapped the ab aur system in the hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) line at @xmath82  ghz with the pdbi .",
    "these observations were obtained with five 15-m antennas using the compact configuration cd ( baselines of 20 - 80 meters ) in march 2002 .",
    "the phase reference center of our measurements was the same as given in the previous section .",
    "we applied one correlator unit with a total bandwidth of only 10  mhz in order to achieve high frequency resolution of @xmath83  kms@xmath43 .",
    "the hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) line was centered at the system velocity @xmath84  kms@xmath43 .",
    "the underlying continuum was detected with broad bands only and has a very low intensity .",
    "the band pass and phase calibration were performed on the objects crl  618 , 0528 + 134 , and 0415 + 3790 .",
    "maps of @xmath85 square pixels with @xmath86 pixel size were produced by the fourier transformation of the calibrated visibilities using natural weighting .",
    "the synthesized hpbw ( half power beam width ) size of the beam was @xmath87 ( @xmath88  au at 144  pc ) with a position angle of @xmath89 .",
    "for the data reduction and final phase calibration , we applied the grenoble software environment gag .",
    "we checked the observed hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) spectra by adding the corresponding single - dish iram data as missed zero - spacing information to the interferometric visibilities .",
    "different weightings were used , but finally it turned out that the appearance of the interferometric spectral map did not change much .",
    "also , we estimated that only @xmath90 of the flux is recovered by utilizing the zero - spacing data .",
    "therefore , in our modeling we use the hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) pdbi data without zero - spacing correction .    as an example , in fig .",
    "[ velo ] we show the distribution of the hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) intensity - weighted velocities within the ab aur system , over plotted by the integrated line intensity ( contour lines ) . though not well spatially resolved with our @xmath73 beam , it appears as a nearly spherically symmetric @xmath91 ( @xmath92  au ) structure with a peculiar `` two - lobe '' ( blueshifted and redshifted ) velocity pattern .",
    "this is a typical sign of a rotating disk - like configuration that is seen close to face - on ( compare with the upper right panel in fig .  3 by * ? ?",
    "the lack of spatial resolution does not allow to determine the radius of this structure precisely , and only an upper limit can be put on this value , @xmath93  au .",
    "the border between two velocity lobes ( zero - velocity gradient , @xmath94 ) corresponds to the projection of the disk rotational axis on the sky plane .",
    "this implies that the disk positional angle is about @xmath95 .",
    "whether the disk size and orientation are indeed close to these first - order observational estimates is verified by the extensive modeling in the following sections .",
    "in this section , we describe and discuss the physical and dynamical model of the ab aur system in detail .",
    "a schematic sketch of this object is presented in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] .",
    "briefly , it is assumed that the ab aur system consists of a passive flaring rotating disk surrounded by an extended infalling spherical envelope .",
    "this dense protoplanetary disk shades off a torus region in the diffuse envelope from strong stellar uv flux , which allows many complex molecules to form and survive there .",
    "in contrast , the composition of the two unshielded envelope lobes is mainly atomic .",
    "since the star directly heats these lobes , they have to be hotter ; in a pure hydrostatic equilibrium it would also imply that they are less dense than the shadowed part of the envelope .",
    "thus , an observationally significant amount of molecules is only reached during the chemical evolution of the ab aur disk and shielded part of the envelope .",
    "the uv - to - mm surveys of herbig ae stars have unveiled that many of these stars are surrounded by circumstellar gas and dust distributed in flattened ( disk - like ) configurations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the presence of a compact structure ( @xmath96  au ) around ab aur has been revealed from ir interferometric measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , at visual wavelengths by the photometric and polarimetric observations of @xcite , and from millimeter interferometric observations of @xcite .",
    "moreover , the latter authors have reported on the keplerian rotation of the gas in this object .",
    "all these facts indicate that a rotating protoplanetary disk encircles the ab aur star .",
    "given that the measured mass accretion rate on the central star is low , @xmath97yr@xmath43 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the vertical structure of the ab aur disk is globally sustained by reprocessing stellar radiation ( passive disk ) but not due to viscous dissipation .    some clues concerning the dust content of the ab aur system",
    "can be gained from the analysis of the sed .",
    "the emission bands of various dust materials have been detected in the ir spectra of ab aur with the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) , most notably those of iron oxide , pahs , amorphous silicates , and water ice @xcite .",
    "the strong silicate emission band at @xmath98 m points to the presence of a large amount of warm ( @xmath99-@xmath100  k ) and small ( @xmath101-@xmath102 m ) amorphous silicate grains in this object .",
    "together with the absence of crystalline silicate features in the spectra , it implies that the dust in ab aur is thermally unprocessed and may still resemble pristine interstellar grains even after a few myr of the evolution ( for more details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a large amount of warm dust and gas observed in the ab aur system ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) can not be accounted for without invoking a flared geometry of the disk or / and an additional disk heating by the surrounding envelope ( importance of the latter effect is discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "this idea is further supported by the results of the detailed modeling of @xcite and @xcite , who have found that a flared disk model with a puffed - up inner rim provides a suitable fit to their nir- and mir - observational data .",
    "unfortunately , the disk of ab aur is detected with the pdbi array only in one line and at modest resolution .",
    "thus it is not possible to unravel the disk thermal and density structure in both radial and vertical directions , using these observational data alone . on the other hand",
    ", many other parameters of the ab aur system have been revealed from previous observations , which can be used to construct a disk chemical model .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt the passive flared disk model of @xcite .",
    "this disk model is calculated using a 2d axisymmetric continuum radiative transfer code and silicate dust opacity data @xcite under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in vertical direction .",
    "the _ a priori _ fixed disk parameters are as follows .",
    "we assume that the dust grains are uniform spheres with radius of 0.3@xmath103 m , though the additional case of larger 1@xmath103 m particles is also considered . in the model",
    ", we focus only on a single - size grain distribution instead of a range of dust sizes because otherwise it would significantly slow down the chemical computations and 2d disk modeling , thus making impossible efficient fitting of the model parameters . the disk surface density as a function of radius obeys a power law , @xmath104 , with the exponent @xmath105 and the initial value @xmath106 to be constrained .",
    "note that the adopted radial gradient @xmath107 is somewhat steeper than the usually assumed value between about @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , we consider two additional models with @xmath110 ( minimum - mass solar nebula ) and @xmath111 ( uniform disk ) .",
    "the disk has its inner boundary at 0.7  au ( dust sublimation radius , @xmath112k ) and extends up to several hundreds au in radial direction , where its vertical height ranges a comparable spatial scale .",
    "the ratio of the disk outer radius to the vertical height at which the star is still sufficiently obscured , @xmath113 , is used to estimate what fraction of the entire ab aur envelope is shadowed ( see fig .",
    "[ scheme ] , dark gray region ) .",
    "we adopt the following parameters of the central star : @xmath114  k , @xmath115 , @xmath116 ( see table  [ star_par ] ) .",
    "it is assumed that the disk is illuminated by the uv radiation from the star and by the interstellar ( is ) uv radiation .",
    "the intensity of the stellar uv flux is calculated using the @xcite atlas9 of stellar spectra .",
    "it is converted to the standard @xmath117 factor , @xmath118 at the distance of 100  au , where @xmath119 corresponds to the mean interstellar uv field of @xcite . to calculate the visual extinction by dust grains toward the central star at a given disk location , we use the following expression ( 1d plane - parallel case ) : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is",
    "the total column density of hydrogen nuclei between the point and the star and the column density to reach @xmath122 is @xmath123  @xmath124 and @xmath125  @xmath124 for the grain radius @xmath126 m and @xmath127 m , respectively .",
    "the extinction of the interstellar uv radiation ( @xmath119 ) is computed in the same way but in vertical direction only .",
    "we calculate the penetration of cosmic rays ( cr ) into the disk by eq .",

    "overall , a wide range of relevant physical parameters characterizes the disk model , namely , temperatures between 35  k and 1500  k , densities between @xmath131  g  @xmath12 and @xmath132  g  @xmath12 , @xmath117 factors @xmath133 , @xmath134 between 0 and more than 100  mag , and ionization rates between @xmath135  s@xmath43 and @xmath136  s@xmath43 . the disk thermal and density structure",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ disk ] .",
    "the parameters of the best - fit disk model are given in table  [ disk_par ] . in section  [ res ]",
    "we discuss how they and their uncertainties are derived .      the body of observational data about the extended nebulosity surrounding ab aur allows constraining some of its basic parameters prior to the detailed modeling .",
    "the visual extinction observed toward this star is low , @xmath137-@xmath138 @xcite , and can be attributed to light scattering and absorption by dust grains in the nearby envelope and interstellar matter ( ism ) .",
    "thus , the ab aur envelope is diffuse and its average density has to be low .",
    "the apparent size and morphology of the envelope depends on the spectral region at which observations are performed .",
    "for instance , an extended @xmath139 ( @xmath140  au ) cloud of cold dust has been observed with the iras satellite at @xmath81 m , which is confirmed by our iram single - dish observations . at visual wavelengths ,",
    "the spherically - symmetric envelope has been traced from @xmath141  au to @xmath142  au with the hst coronographic imaging by @xcite , who have also found that it is highly inhomogeneous from hundreds au down to tens of au ( spiral arches ) .",
    "they have mentioned that this symmetric ( inner ) envelope is further surrounded by a large band of the reflection nebulosity that has been detected with ground - based telescopes .",
    "an envelope of almost the same structure has been observed by @xcite using the _ john hopkins university coronograph_. they have put a lower limit on the mass of the reflection nebulosity using its visual brightness , @xmath143 ( this seems to be a strong underestimation ) .",
    "@xcite have not resolved the ab aur envelope with the _ kuiper airborne observatory _ at 50@xmath103 m and @xmath144 m and gave an upper limit to its size , @xmath145  au .    at millimeter wavelengths ,",
    "the global distribution of the circumstellar matter around ab aur has been probed in several low rotational lines of co isotopomers with the iram 30-m antenna by @xcite .",
    "fuente et al .",
    "have estimated the envelope mass within 0.08  pc ( @xmath146  au ) to be @xmath147 .",
    "they have classified ab aur as a class  ii object according to their notation ( a star embedded in the remnant natal cloud ) , which implies a power - law radial density profile with an @xmath148 exponent . with these two limiting cases of the density profile , the derived mass @xmath149 , and assuming that the envelope extends down to the dust sublimation radius @xmath150  au , we find that the typical density at @xmath151 is between @xmath152 and @xmath153  @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , @xcite have fitted the sed of ab aur using a model of a flat disk immersed in a spherically - symmetric diffuse envelope .",
    "their best - fit parameters for the ab aur envelope are the following : the mass is about @xmath154 , the radial density distribution follows a broken power law , @xmath155 for @xmath156 and @xmath111 for @xmath157  au with initial density of @xmath158  @xmath12 , and the temperature scales with radius as @xmath159 .",
    "recently , @xcite have fitted the ab aur sed from uv to the radio domain with a similar model of a pure spherical envelope and assuming large porous grains ( dust emissivity @xmath160 ) .",
    "they have adopted radial power - law temperature ( @xmath161 ) and density ( @xmath162 ) distributions with @xmath163  k and @xmath164  @xmath12 at @xmath165  au .    using these observational facts and theoretical constraints , we construct a model of the ab aur envelope .",
    "since we probed the molecular content of the ab aur envelope in several lines with the iram 30-m antenna , it allows to derive the temperature and density structure of the envelope _ directly _ from these data .",
    "thus , extensive modeling of its physical structure with an advanced radiative ( hydro- ) code can be omitted .",
    "we focus on the inner part of the entire ab aur envelope and assume that it is spherically symmetric , homogeneous , and has a radius of @xmath166  au ( restricted by the largest @xmath167 iram beam size used in our single - dish observations ) . given a low inclination of the disk inferred from the interferometric data , the shielded part of the envelope is also seen close to face - on . in this case , it makes no sense to consider the outer regions of the envelope beyond 2200  au since they are molecularly deficient along the line of sight ( apart from h@xmath2 and co ) , while in the opposite direction the emitting material is out of the used iram beams .",
    "we assume that the inner radius of the ab aur envelope coincides with the disk outer edge , @xmath168600  au .",
    "the envelope radial density profile is modeled with a power law , @xmath169 , where @xmath170 and @xmath107 are parameters to be constrained .",
    "we assume that the shadowed part of the ab aur envelope is isothermal , than its mean kinetic temperature @xmath171 can be directly estimated from the @xmath172 intensity of the optically thick co(2 - 1 ) line : @xmath173-@xmath174  k ( see table  [ lines ] ) .",
    "our initial guess for the inner envelope temperature is similar to the range @xmath175-@xmath176  k derived by @xcite from the analysis of excitation conditions for several co low- and high - rotational lines .",
    "we assume that gas and dust species are in thermal equilibrium , which is a justified assumption for the inner ( dense , cold , and shadowed ) part of the envelope .",
    "the gas - grain and grain - grain collisional timescales in the ab aur envelope are larger than those in the dense disk .",
    "this essentially rules out the possibility that a profound grain growth up to cm - sized bodies occurred there during the contraction phase , which is further supported by the fact that the bulk of dust grains in the ab aur system are smaller than a few microns .",
    "therefore , we assume that dust particles in the envelope are small uniform spheres with radius of @xmath177 m .",
    "the approach of the previous subsection is adopted to compute the uv flux in the shadowed part of the envelope , but with some minor modifications . as this region",
    "is shielded from the direct stellar radiation , it is only necessary to take into account the penetration of the is uv photons . given the low radial density of the envelope ( @xmath178  g  @xmath124 ) , the constant cr - ionization rate is taken , @xmath128  s@xmath43 , whereas ionization due to the decay of the radionuclides is negligibly low , @xmath179 .",
    "the best - fit parameters of the ab aur envelope model are compiled in table  [ env_par ] and discussed in section  [ res ] .",
    "the chemical model adopted in this study is the same as in paper  i , but with a few modifications .",
    "briefly , we use the umist95 database of gas - phase reactions @xcite supplied by a set of dust surface reactions from @xcite and @xcite . in the rates of reactions with cosmic ray particles and cr - induced uv photons the cr - ionization rate , @xmath180 , is replaced either by the sum of @xmath181 ( disk ) or left unchanged ( envelope ) .",
    "contrary to paper  i and in accordance with the studies by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , we assume that the probability of species to stick onto dust grain surfaces is 100% . finally , we enlarge the chemical network with a set of deuteration reactions ( bergin , personal communication ) and take into account self- and mutual - shielding of h@xmath2 and co molecules",
    ". our chemical network does not include reactions involving c@xmath0o , therefore we scale down the co abundances calculated without self - shielding by the isotopic ratio o/@xmath0o=490 @xcite .",
    "overall , this network consists of 560 species made of 13 elements , and 5336 reactions .",
    "though @xcite have found that the vertical mixing and radial transport may significantly affect the disk chemical evolution under certain conditions , we do not consider these processes in our model because of three main reasons .",
    "first , the estimated mass accretion rate on ab aur is low , therefore the radial transport of matter toward the central star is slow .",
    "second , there is observational evidence that turbulence in protoplanetary disks is low , @xmath182 - 0.2  kms@xmath43 ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and consequently diffusion processes can be not that important .",
    "last ( but not least ) reason why mixing processes are not considered is that the chemical model has to be remain the numerically manageable .",
    "we adopt deuterium chemical reactions from @xcite .",
    "this set includes essential formation and destruction routes relevant to the chemical evolution of od and hdo .",
    "it consists of about 60 gas - phase and 10 gas - grain reactions among 11 species including accretion onto and desorption from dust surfaces of d , od , and hdo species .",
    "the elemental abundance of deuterium , d / h=@xmath183 , is taken from @xcite .",
    "the photodissociation of h@xmath2 occurs through discrete absorption in werner and lyman bands in the wavelength range between @xmath184   and @xmath185   with an efficiency of @xmath186 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given the fact that these lines become optically thick when the hydrogen column density reaches @xmath187  @xmath124 , it is unavoidable to take into account the effect of the h@xmath2 line self - shielding both for the disk and envelope chemistry . to calculate the h@xmath2 shielding",
    ", we use an analytical expression  ( 37 ) from @xcite , @xmath188,\\ ] ] where @xmath189  @xmath124 and @xmath190  cm  s@xmath43 .",
    "the unattenuated dissociation rate of hydrogen molecules for the interstellar uv radiation ( @xmath119 ) is taken as @xmath191  @xmath192  s@xmath43 .",
    "the photodissociation of co molecules is dominated by discrete absorption at @xmath193 , though it also proceeds via continuum absorption @xcite .",
    "since hydrogen molecules dissociate in the same wavelength range , one has to account for mutual - shielding by coincidental lines of h@xmath2 and dust extinction when calculating the co self - shielding .",
    "this is a complex task and there is no a convenient analytical representation similar to eq .",
    "( [ h2ss ] ) .",
    "therefore , we follow the approach of @xcite and compute the co self - shielding by interpolating the values from table  11 of @xcite , where a set of the shielding factors is given as a function of the h@xmath2 and co column densities and visual extinction by dust grains . as initial",
    "guess for the co column densities in the medium under consideration , we use those of h@xmath2 and scale them by a constant factor , co / h@xmath194 .",
    "the adopted unattenuated photodissociation rate of co molecules is @xmath195  @xmath192  s@xmath43 .",
    "the initial abundances for the chemical model are calculated as in paper  i. concisely , we simulate the chemical evolution of a molecular cloud with uniform temperature @xmath196  k and density @xmath197  @xmath12 for 1  myr with the reaction network described above and the `` low metal '' abundances from @xcite .    using these pre - computed quantities and the model of the ab aur system , a set of time - dependent molecular abundances and vertical column densities",
    "are computed for 3  myr of the evolution in every iterative step of the modeling .",
    "below we discuss the results obtained with the final ( best - fit ) set of model parameters ( tables  [ star_par][env_par ] ) .    the calculated hco@xmath1 and co vertical column densities as a function of radius",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ colden ] . as can be clearly seen",
    ", @xmath198 in general follows the radial decline of the surface density and thus is less steep for the ab aur envelope than for the disk .",
    "the fact that co column densities are strongly related to the total amount of hydrogen in both the disk and envelope , @xmath199(co)/@xmath199(h)@xmath200 , merely reflects chemical stability and efficient shielding of co molecules from dissociating uv radiation . in contrast , the hco@xmath1 column densities as a function of radius show a more complicated behavior because the chemical evolution of this molecular ion is governed by a larger set of formation and destruction pathways ( compare solid and dashed lines in fig  [ colden ] ) .",
    "for instance , a rapid decrease of @xmath201 in the outer parts of the disk and envelope is caused not only by the decline of the surface density , but also due to enhanced recombination rate of hco@xmath1 molecular ions with abundant electrons .",
    "these regions are rather transparent for the impinging uv photons that dissociate molecules and ionize chemical species ( mostly carbon atoms ) , thereby increasing the electron concentration in the gas - phase and decreasing the hco@xmath1 abundances .",
    "the difference between the chemical evolution of the disk and shielded part of the envelope is the following .",
    "the disk has density , temperature , and uv - intensity gradients in both vertical and radial directions , leading to a `` layered '' chemical structure .",
    "the abundances of many gas - phase species peak at the disk intermediate layer where the uv flux is mild enough to drive a rich molecular chemistry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "contrary to the disk , the shadowed envelope region is cold , less dense , and opaque to the stellar uv radiation ( but not to the interstellar uv photons ) .",
    "therefore , many photoreactions and reactions with barrier can not efficiently proceed there , which results in a more simplified ( `` dark '' ) chemistry .",
    "it is interesting that the chemical equilibrium for hco@xmath1 and many other species is achieved almost everywhere in the disk and envelope at @xmath202-@xmath203  myr ( compare open squares and solid line in the left and right panels in fig .",
    "[ colden ] ) .",
    "however , we find that this is not true for deuterated species whose abundances and column densities vary during the entire 3  myr of the evolution , and thus may serve as a `` chemical clock '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we also investigate how various physical and chemical factors influence the evolution of hco@xmath1 in the disk in detail .",
    "first , we consider the standard model of the umist95 chemistry , @xmath204 m grains , and @xmath205  myr , but two limiting gas - to - dust mass ratios , 10 and 1000 . as can be clearly seen , the resulting column densities are nearly the same as in the case of the standard value @xmath206 for @xmath207  au , @xmath208  @xmath124 ( compare crosses , open circles , and solid line in fig  [ colden ] , left panel ) . at larger radii , these quantities for @xmath209 decrease faster with radius than the column densities computed with the standard chemical model and the difference at @xmath210  au reaches about 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "contrary , in the case of @xmath211 the radial decline is shallower than in the standard case , and at @xmath210  au the calculated column densities differ by a factor of 10 .",
    "a similar tendency is seen for the model of larger 1@xmath103 m dust particles . in the inner disk regions , @xmath212  au",
    ", the corresponding hco@xmath1 column densities are @xmath213 times higher than that of the standard model @xmath206 , while at larger radii they decrease with radius like in the case of @xmath209 ( compare solid line with open triangles in the left panel in fig  [ colden ] ) .",
    "all these trends can be understood if one recalls the fact that the disk at @xmath214  au has a so low surface density that the interstellar uv radiation can easily penetrate and thus controls the chemistry . as we noted above",
    ", the hco@xmath1 abundances strongly depend on the total amount of electrons in the gas - phase . in turn , the overall electron concentration in the outer disk regions is related to the value of dust extinction in vertical direction : the higher the extinction is , the lower is the electron concentration ( and the higher is the resulting hco@xmath1 column densities ) . for a fixed hydrogen column density and two models of uniform grains ,",
    "the ratio of the corresponding visual extinction values is @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the gas - to - dust mass ratio and @xmath217 is the extinction efficiency factor for a particle with the radius @xmath218 .    according to this equation , the disk with the gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath219 is 10 times more transparent in vertical direction than in the case of the standard model with @xmath206 , while the disk with 10 times more dust grains ( @xmath211 ) is 10 times more opaque .",
    "similarly , in the case of larger @xmath127 m grains , the total visual extinction is @xmath220 times smaller than that of the standard @xmath204 m grain model due to @xmath220 times higher extinction efficiency and about 27 times reduced amount of dust particles in unit volume .",
    "moreover , the @xmath221 times larger radius of @xmath127 m dust grains in respect to the @xmath204 m particles also implies that coulomb attraction of positively charged ions and negatively charged dust particles is smaller , leading to less effective grain neutralization of hco@xmath1 ions . in turn , this results in the bump of the hco@xmath1 column density curve at @xmath212  au ( compare solid line with open triangles in fig  [ colden ] ) .",
    "another important question that needs to be clarified is how sensitive the chemical modeling to the adopted set of reactions is .",
    "there are two available chemical databases that are widely used , namely , umist95 ( university of manchester , t. millar s group ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and osu03 ( ohio state university , e. herbst s group ; * ? ? ?",
    "these networks comprise hundreds of species and thousands of reactions with the rates that are not always the same @xcite .    to answer this question",
    ", we repeat the chemical calculations for the disk model with @xmath127 m dust grains using the osu03 network instead of the umist95 reaction set . the corresponding hco@xmath1 column densities are depicted in fig .",
    "[ colden ] , left panel , dot - dashed curve .",
    "as can be clearly seen , @xmath201 for the osu03 and umist95 models are nearly the same everywhere in the disk except for the very inner parts , @xmath222  au ( compare dot - dashed line and open triangles in the figure ) . there , the column densities of hco@xmath1 computed with the osu03 model decrease more rapidly with radius than in the case of the umist95 network . in a forthcoming paper ( semenov et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , we will compare the results of the disk chemical modeling with the umist95 and osu03 networks and investigate in detail what the reasons for the difference in resulting molecular abundances are .",
    "moreover , recently @xcite have shown that computed abundances of hco@xmath1 ions in dark and diffuse molecular clouds can be uncertain by a factor of @xmath223-@xmath224 due to uncertainties in the reaction rate coefficients of the umist95 database ( see fig .  1 therein ) .",
    "given a broad range of physical conditions encountered in the applied disk model , most probably the calculated hco@xmath1 column densities suffer from the same uncertainty of a factor of @xmath225 .",
    "the total computational time for the disk model with 7 radial and 11 vertical grid points is @xmath226 hours on a pentium iv 2.4  ghz pc , while it takes about several hours to compute the chemical evolution of the envelope model with 28 grid points .",
    "in this section , we describe our approach to simulate the radiative transfer in molecular lines and to synthesize their spectra .",
    "in essence , the radiative transfer modeling is based on the solution to the radiative transfer ( rt ) equation coupled with balance equations for molecular level populations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "prior to the modeling , one needs to provide density , temperature , and velocity distributions as well as molecular abundances in the medium .",
    "we solve the system of the radiative transfer and balance equations with the 2d non - lte code `` uran(ia ) '' developed by @xcite .",
    "it partly uses the scheme originally proposed and implemented in the publically available 1d code `` ratran '' @xcite .",
    "the iterative algorithm of `` uran(ia ) '' is the following .",
    "first , initial molecular level populations and a set of photon random paths through the model grid have to be defined . using these quantities ,",
    "the specific intensities @xmath227 are computed for each cell @xmath228 by the explicit integration of the rt - equation along the pre - defined photon paths @xmath229 . for the photon ray - tracing ,",
    "the code employs a monte carlo description .",
    "after that , @xmath229 and @xmath227 are used to calculate the mean line intensity @xmath230 in every cell .",
    "the computed mean intensities are utilized in the next iteration step to refine the level populations by solving balance equations in all model cells . to accelerate convergence of the entire procedure for optically thick lines , additional internal subiterations for each grid cell ( ali scheme )",
    "are included on top of the global iterations .",
    "the adopted acceleration scheme relies on the fact that the calculated mean line intensity in every particular cell can be divided into internal component generated in the cell and external contributions from other cells of the grid .",
    "therefore , subiterations are applied to bring into an agreement the internal mean intensity of the line and corresponding level populations ( for more detail , see * ? ? ?",
    "the global iterations are performed until the final molecular level populations are obtained .",
    "after that , we repeat the calculations again , but with another set of pre - defined random photon paths in order to estimate a typical error of the computed values . in our simulations , the relative errors in the level populations are always smaller than @xmath231 .",
    "finally , the resulting level populations are used to calculate the corresponding excitation temperatures , which are further transformed into synthetic beam - convolved single - dish and interferometric spectra .",
    "there are a few limitations in our code .",
    "since `` uran(ia ) '' does not contain a realization of the radiative transfer in the lines with fine structures yet , formally we are only allowed to consider rotational transitions of co , cs , hco@xmath1 and their isotopomers among the full set of the detected species .",
    "the utilized collisional rate data for co , cs , and hco@xmath1 are taken from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "also , we do not take into account the continuum absorption and emission by dust grains , which is a reliable approximation for optically thin and moderately optically thick lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      for the line radiative transfer modeling of the ab aur system we use the set of input parameters compiled in table  [ lrt_par ] .",
    "standard keplerian rotation is adopted to represent the regular velocity field of the disk .",
    "the quality of the acquired interferometric data does not permit us to verify from the radial velocity shifts of the observed lines whether the disk rotation is indeed keplerian ( @xmath232 ) or follows another power law ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the ab aur disk has a much smaller mass in comparison with the stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , therefore such an assumption should be valid .",
    "little is known about the dynamical state of the ab aur envelope .",
    "therefore , we consider a steady accretion of the envelope material on the disk ( and consequently on the central star ) , with the regular velocity that can be found from the conservation - of - mass principle and adopted power - law exponent @xmath107 of the radial density distribution : @xmath233 . for example , for @xmath234 the infall velocity decreases as @xmath235 . in agreement with recent observations by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the uniform microturbulent velocity @xmath236  kms@xmath43 is assumed for both the disk and envelope model .    the computed disk excitation temperatures of the co(2 - 1 ) , cs(2 - 1 ) , hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) , and hco@xmath1(3 - 2 ) transitions are shown in fig .",
    "as can be clearly seen , the excitation temperature @xmath237 for the co(2 - 1 ) line follows the kinetic temperature everywhere in the disk but the surface layer ( compare the left panel in fig .",
    "[ disk ] with the top left panel in fig .  [ ex ] ) .",
    "this line is easily excited ( critical density @xmath238  @xmath12 ) and thus thermalized in most of the disk and envelope regions , @xmath239  @xmath12 .",
    "given this fact and the high abundance of co molecules , co / h@xmath240 , the co(2 - 1 ) line is optically thick with @xmath241-@xmath219 in the disk and @xmath242 in the envelope .    in contrast , the cs(2 - 1 ) transition requires about 200 times higher density for thermalization , therefore its excitation temperature peaks closer to the dense disk interior ( see the top right panel in fig .",
    "the optical thickness of the cs(2 - 1 ) line is low , @xmath243 , mainly due to much lower gas - phase cs abundances compared with the amount of co molecules , @xmath244 .",
    "the disk excitation temperatures of the hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) and hco@xmath1 ( 3 - 2 ) transitions are shown in bottom of fig .",
    "[ ex ] ( left and right panels , respectively ) .",
    "the 3 - 2 rotational line is excited at about 10 times higher density than the critical density for hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) , @xmath245  @xmath12 , leading to the lower excitation temperatures in the former case . since hco@xmath1 ions are only @xmath246 times more abundant than cs molecules , the hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) and hco@xmath1(3 - 2 ) lines have a low optical depth of about @xmath247 .",
    "the disk excitation map for the c@xmath0o(2 - 1 ) emission is similar to that of co(2 - 1 ) and therefore is not shown .",
    "note that the cs(2 - 1 ) and hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) excitation temperatures show a broad zone in the disk intermediate layer , where @xmath248 ( light gray areas in the bottom left and top right panels , fig .",
    "[ ex ] ) . here",
    "a non - lte effect plays a role .",
    "the inversion in the rotational level populations is caused by a specific ratio between collisional and radiative ( de- ) excitation probabilities . in those disk parts , where the concentration of cs and hco@xmath1 is rather low ,",
    "their levels are excited and de - excited by collisions and only radiatively de - excited ( but not excited ) .",
    "thus , the lte condition is broken and level populations do not follow the boltzmann distribution .",
    "this effect for the cs molecule has been considered by @xcite in detail .",
    "however , such inversion does not lead to significant maser amplification of the line intensity even for the most favorable case of the edge - on disk .",
    "as soon as the optical depth of the line approaches unity ( which is only possible in radial direction ) , stimulated radiative transitions become operative .",
    "they additionally excite and de - excite the level populations and destroy the inversion .",
    "we do not present the resulting excitation temperatures for the envelope model because the excitation conditions there do not change as strongly as in the case of the disk , and resemble those of the low - density disk surface .",
    "consequently , the cs(2 - 1 ) and hco@xmath1(3 - 2 ) emission lines are not thermalized anywhere in the envelope , @xmath249 , whereas hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) is partly thermalized in the inner part at @xmath250  au : @xmath251 .",
    "finally , the co(2 - 1 ) and c@xmath0o(2 - 1 ) lines are thermalized in the entire envelope with @xmath252  k.    a typical computation for a @xmath253 grid model , 11 transitions , and the optically thick co(2 - 1 ) line needs about 2 days on a pentium iv 2.4  ghz pc . in the extremely optically thin approximation applied to simulate the radiative transfer in the cs(2 - 1 ) , cs(5 - 4 ) , c@xmath0o(2 - 1 ) , hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) , and hco@xmath1(3 - 2 ) lines , the photon ray tracing and ali scheme are not used . in this case , the level populations are computed within a few seconds .",
    "the validity of this approach is verified by comparing once the level populations of the cs(2 - 1 ) , c@xmath0o(2 - 1 ) , hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) , and hco@xmath1(3 - 2 ) transitions calculated with the full line radiative transfer and in the limit of the extremely low optical depth .",
    "it is found that both methods yield very similar results both for the disk and envelope model .",
    "in this section , we confront the theoretical model of the ab aur system with the observational data and constrain basic parameters of the disk and envelope",
    ". it would be mathematically more correct to compare the interferometric data with the model results in the _",
    "uv_-plane in order to avoid the highly nonlinear deconvolution procedure ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this is only meaningful for low - noise data , when model parameters can be determined with a high accuracy , e.g. , by utilizing chi - square minimization .",
    "however , we follow a more illustrative way and face the synthesized hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) interferometric map _ directly _ with the observed line profiles .",
    "another limiting factor for our numerical simulations is the computational time .",
    "typically , it takes about 10 - 30 minutes to generate one synthetic single - dish spectrum and @xmath254 days to synthesize the entire interferometric map with a 2.4  ghz pentium iv machine . together with chemical and non - lte line radiative transfer calculations , a total computational time for one modeling run can be as long as about 3 days .",
    "therefore , a full @xmath255-minimization in the space of all parameters to be constrained is not feasible for our approach , and one has to estimate these values and their uncertainties with a more robust analysis .",
    "this analysis is based on the fact that many model parameters can be constrained _ independently _ from the others in a subsequent way ( `` step - by - step '' ) , starting from suitable initial guesses .",
    "first , we use the first - order estimates for the ab aur disk orientation and determine more precisely the value of the disk inclination by fitting the width of the central hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) spectrum in the interferometric map .",
    "next , with this best - fit value we derive the disk positional angle by fitting the asymmetry of the observed line profiles out of the map center .",
    "after the best - fit disk orientation is found , we investigate how the radial gradient of the normalized synthetic line intensities depends on the assumed disk radius and choose accordingly the best - fit value of the disk size .",
    "finally , the derived disk orientation and radius allow us to constrain the total disk mass because this value defines the absolute intensities of the modeled hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) lines on the interferometric map .",
    "the uncertainties of the best - fit disk parameters are found by the same iterative way .",
    "consequently , we constrain temperature , density structure , and mass of the inner , shielded part of the ab aur envelope using the best - fit disk orientation and radius .",
    "first , we determine the temperature of the envelope and its uncertainty by modeling the intensity of the optically thick co(2 - 1 ) line ( see sect .  [ env_model ] ) .",
    "second , with the best - fit envelope temperature , we iteratively find the value of the radial density gradient , initial density at the envelope inner radius , and their uncertainties by fitting the observed single - dish hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) , hco@xmath1(3 - 2 ) , c@xmath0o(2 - 1 ) and cs(2 - 1 ) spectra .",
    "we present the results for our best - fit model of the ab aur disk .",
    "then we discuss how parameters of this model are actually derived .",
    "this model is found after approximately 15 subsequent iterative steps of the modeling .",
    "the simulated and observed interferometric hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) maps are compared in fig .",
    "as can be clearly seen , intensities and widths of the synthetic spectra match well the observed values , @xmath256  k and @xmath257  kms@xmath43 .",
    "moreover , the synthesized line profiles in general follow the shape of the observed spectra on the entire interferometric map .",
    "this proofs again that the keplerian law is a reasonable representation of the disk global velocity field .",
    "the low intensities of the observed interferometric spectra , @xmath256  k , suggest that the hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) line is optically thin .",
    "given a typical excitation temperature in the disk for this transition , @xmath258  k ( see fig .  [ ex ] , lower left panel ) , the optical depth of hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) can be roughly estimated as @xmath259 , exactly the value we have found in sect .  [ texc ] .",
    "the double - peaked shape of the synthetic line profiles and their asymmetry are the result of the gaussian convolution with the @xmath260 beam over the inclined disk of a similar size ( see table  [ disk_par ] ) .",
    "every hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) spectrum is a beam - weighted average of the emission generated in various disk regions that have a broad velocity range ( from negative to positive values in respect to the system velocity ) .",
    "the central spectrum on the interferometric map has a symmetric profile because disk locations with various velocities contribute equally to the formation of this line .",
    "similarly , all spectra located along the projection of the disk rotational axis on the sky plane ( zero - velocity line , @xmath94 ) are also symmetric ( compare the line profiles nearby straight line and in perpendicular direction in fig .  [ map ] ) .",
    "all other spectra have asymmetric line profiles due to the beam weighting over the disk parts that have a lack of either blueshifted or redshifted emission components .",
    "the contrast between the left and right intensity peaks of the hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) lines depends on the orientation of the beam in respect to the zero - velocity line and is maximal in orthogonal direction .",
    "the convolution with a beam size comparable to the size of the adopted disk model leads to the non - zero hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) intensities beyond the disk outer boundary ( depicted by circle in fig",
    ".  [ map ] ) .",
    "it is worth to mention here that the convolution with a beam size that is several times smaller than the disk size would produce a synthetic map of the narrow single - peaked spectra with different velocity shifts in different disk parts , @xmath261 .",
    "note that there is a region in the interferometric map out of the disk ( @xmath262 , @xmath263 ) , where the observed hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) lines have a peculiar shape that is far from the modeled one ( upper right corner in fig .",
    "[ map ] ) .",
    "this shape has a @xmath264  k absorption feature with about @xmath65  kms@xmath43 offset from the system velocity @xmath265 and a @xmath266  k emission peak centered at @xmath265 , closely resembling an inverse p cygni profile .",
    "it has been checked that the profiles of these `` emission - absorption '' spectra are stable to the data reduction with various cleaning parameters and weightings . as we mentioned in section  [ pdbi ] , the detected hco@xmath1(1 - 0 )",
    "continuum is low , which contradicts with the absolute intensity of the absorption peak .",
    "thus , this is a `` ghost '' feature in the spectra , though the strength , width , and position of the central peak is consistent with the emission arising in low - velocity envelope regions .",
    "moreover , the peculiarity in the observed profiles is only seen in a part of the full interferometric map .",
    "the presence of a small dense structure in the disk outer region or nearby envelope could be responsible for the appearance of such emission - absorption spectra in the deconvolved interferometric map .",
    "why this structure has to be small and dense can be easily explained : its small ( @xmath267 ) angular extent is a necessary condition to produce the peculiar profiles in a confined area of the whole @xmath268 spectral map only , while a high density contrast is needed for the interferometer to `` see '' the presence of such an inhomogeneity .",
    "interestingly , @xcite have resolved the ab aur system at the @xmath99  au scale using the _ subaru coronographic imager and adaptive optics _ at near - infrared wavelengths and discovered a few spiral arms and a knotty structure associated with a circular inhomogeneous structure of @xmath269  au radius ( see fig .  2 and 3 therein ) .",
    "thus , it is likely that one of these local and compact structures with enhanced density has been detected during our pdbi observational campaign .",
    "the fact that the interferometer probes only dense and compact matter is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ space ] , where we compare the observed beam - normalized hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) iram 30-m and averaged pdbi spectra .",
    "the iram line profile is narrow , @xmath270  kms@xmath43 and single - peaked , while the pdbi spectrum is about 4  kms@xmath43 wide and has a double - peaked shape .",
    "furthermore , their normalized intensities differ by a factor of 2 .",
    "the reason for such a diversity in the observed spectra is that the iram 30-m antenna has @xmath167 beam for the hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) transition , covers large spatial scales , and therefore is not capable in detecting the emission from the small ab aur disk due to the huge beam dilution .",
    "instead , the hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) emission from the surrounding envelope is only observed .",
    "contrary , the @xmath271 pdbi beam is sensitive to small spatial scales and thus does not `` feel '' the emission that comes from the low - density and extended envelope ( e.g. , see the spectrum at the position @xmath272 , @xmath273 in fig .  [ map ] ) .",
    "first , the disk inclination angle @xmath274 is determined by comparing the observed hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) line profile at the center of the interferometric map with the corresponding synthetic spectrum .",
    "the modeled central line has a symmetric double - peaked profile independent of the actual value of the disk positional angle ( see fig .",
    "[ map ] , @xmath275 , @xmath276 ) .",
    "however , the line width and intensity do depend on the assumed value of the inclination angle , as shown in fig .",
    "it can be clearly seen that a @xmath277 inclination of the disk results in a too narrow ( @xmath270  kms@xmath43 ) modeled spectrum compared with the observed @xmath278  kms@xmath43 line width ( fig .",
    "[ incl ] , left panel ) .",
    "on the other hand , the disk inclined by @xmath279 produces a slightly broader spectrum than observed ( fig .",
    "[ incl ] , right panel ) .",
    "thus , the disk inclination angle has the best - fit value somewhere between these two limits , @xmath280 ( middle panel in the figure ) .",
    "we take @xmath281 as the best - fit inclination angle of the ab aur disk .",
    "note that a similar approach to constrain the disk inclination was recently presented by @xcite , who applied it for the tw hya disk based on the sma observations in the co(2 - 1 ) and co(3 - 2 ) lines .",
    "the accuracy of this value is mainly determined by the uncertainty in stellar mass and by the radial gradient of the disk surface density , whereas other model parameters play a minor role .",
    "the width of the modeled central hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) line for a fixed value of the disk inclination angle and density gradient varies as @xmath282 ( keplerian law ) .",
    "we consider two values of the stellar mass , @xmath283 and @xmath284 , and find that for the low - mass limit of @xmath285 the best - fit disk inclination is @xmath286 , while for the @xmath287 star this value is about @xmath288 .",

    "in contrast , the observed hco@xmath1(3 - 2 ) emission comes partly from the ab aur disk and partly from the surrounding envelope , therefore a reasonable fit to this line is only produced by the full disk - in - envelope model ( see second row of plots in the figure ) .",
    "particularly , the broad @xmath254  kms@xmath43 width of the observed hco@xmath1(3 - 2 ) spectrum is not possible to explain without accounting for the emission from the ab aur disk .",
    "still , the synthetic hco@xmath1(3 - 2 ) spectrum peaks at about 1  kms@xmath43 higher velocity than the observed emission from the ab aur envelope , which can not be explained in the framework of the applied model .",
    "the uncertainties of the derived parameters are estimated as follows .",
    "we adopt a factor of 7 uncertainties for the best - fit value of the envelope mass and initial density at the inner envelope edge based on the results of a similar investigation performed for the ab aur disk model ( see extensive discussion in the previous section ) .",
    "the uncertainty of the determined radial density profile @xmath381 is found to be @xmath382 .",

    "therefore , the intensity of the modeled cs(5 - 4 ) line becomes very low after the convolution with the @xmath389 ( @xmath390  au ) iram beam .",
    "consequently , a necessary requirement for a model of the ab aur system to reproduce the observed cs(5 - 4 ) line intensity would be the presence of high - density media ( clumps ? ) at @xmath391 - 200  au distance from the central star .",
    "we find that the intensity , width , and profile of cs(5 - 4 ) can be reproduced very well with a 5 times more massive model of the ab aur envelope than the best - fit one .",
    "however , in this case all other modeled single - dish lines are differ substantially from the observed spectra .",

    "the total mass of the ab aur inner envelope for the model discussed here is @xmath415 .",
    "moreover , assuming that the best - fit density profile of the inner envelope model is also appropriate at larger distances until the cloud outer border at 35000  au , we calculate the mass of the _ entire _ ab aur envelope , @xmath416 , which is exactly the value measured by @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the density structure and mass of the envelope models considered above are summarized in table  [ env_com ] .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss the evolutionary nature of the ab aur system , using the results of our modeling .    with the reconstructed best - fit velocity profile of the ab aur envelope ( see table  [ env_par ] ) , one can estimate _ independently _ the mass accretion rate in this system : @xmath417 where @xmath379  g@xmath12 is the initial density at the disk outer edge @xmath418  au and @xmath372 is the shadowing angle . according to this expression , the mass accretion rate from the ab aur envelope onto the disk is @xmath419  yr@xmath43 .",
    "this value is very close to the measured mass accretion to the central star , @xmath420  yr@xmath43 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if one assumes that the mass accretion rate is due to the viscous evolution of the disk only , then dispersal timescale for the @xmath421 ab aur disk is @xmath422  myr , which is too short in comparison with the @xmath423  myr age of ab aur .",
    "thus , accretion from the envelope should play a major role in the evolution of the ab aur system as a whole .",
    "the lifetime of the entire @xmath77  au envelope can be roughly estimated from the same principles , @xmath424  yr@xmath43 , which gives evolutionary timescale of about @xmath425  myr .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the ab aur system will remain a class  ii object for the next few million years .",
    "the estimated timescale for dispersal of the ab aur envelope is in sharp contrast to the free - fall time from the envelope outer edge at 35000 au on the central star , @xmath426  myr .",
    "thus , contraction of the envelope is not free - fall and regulated by additional force(s ) acting against gravitation , like thermal pressure , rotation , turbulence , or magnetic field .",
    "the suggestion that the ab aur envelope fully rotates can be essentially ruled out given the fact that the widths of the observed single - dish lines are narrow , @xmath427  kms@xmath43 .",
    "indeed , it is found that the model with only @xmath347 of the keplerian rotation representing the regular velocity field in the envelope produces wider synthetic single - dish lines than observed . on the other hand",
    ", conservation and redistribution of initial angular momentum of the natal cloud out of which the ab aur system has been formed should end up in a rotating flattened configuration ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "thus , it explains why the ab aur envelope is flattened and suggests that the envelope slowly rotates , @xmath428  kms@xmath43 , in addition to the infall .",
    "furthermore , by fitting the line widths with various microturbulent velocities , we find that turbulence in the envelope should be low , @xmath429  kms@xmath43 , which is smaller than the sound speed , @xmath430  kms@xmath43 .",
    "therefore , these subsonic turbulent motions can not retard the cloud collapse .",
    "also , the ab aur envelope can not be supported against the gravitational contraction by thermal pressure either since it is not spherically symmetric , and rather cold , @xmath360  k. finally , magnetic pressure can slow down the collapse , but only if the envelope matter is well coupled to the magnetic field .",
    "the computed ionization fraction for the best - fit ab aur envelope is about @xmath431-@xmath432 and thus the latter requirement is fulfilled .",
    "therefore , we conclude that slow rotation and magnetic pressure play a major role in the dynamical evolution of the ab aur envelope by regulating the speed of the collapse . in turn , it defines the accretion rate onto the disk and thus its mass and consequently the lifetime of the _ entire _ ab aur system , @xmath433  myr . also , these two dynamical factors are responsible for the flattened appearance of the envelope .",
    "note that the presence of such asymmetric structures around protoplanetary disks has been predicted by modern theories of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and inferred from observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in a more general sense , our findings support the idea of @xcite , who have argued that the observed disk lifetimes between 1 and 10  myr are mostly determined by the initial mass available for the accretion , but not by the mass of the central star(s ) .",
    "the instantaneous infall of the envelope matter onto the rotationally supported disk should produce an accretion shock interface , and likely _ local _",
    "density enhancement(s ) at the disk outer edge @xcite .",
    "then it is natural to ask whether these disk regions remain stable or not .",
    "the gravitational instability in rotating disklike configurations is suppressed when the so - called toomre parameter exceeds about unity ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath434 where @xmath435 is the sound speed , @xmath436 is the epicyclical velocity at the radius @xmath326 , @xmath117 is gravitational constant , and @xmath437 being the disk surface density .    applying this equation to three considered disk models that fit the observations , namely , the uniform disk ( @xmath111 ) , minimum - mass solar nebula ( @xmath110 ) , and reference model ( @xmath105 ) , we find that the corresponding @xmath438-factors at the disk outer boundary @xmath210  au are 0.57 , 22 , and 300 , respectively .",
    "it is likely that these values are smaller because of the local density enhancement at the disk outer edge due to the mass flow from the envelope .",
    "thus , continuous mass feeding of the ab aur disk from the surrounding envelope may make it gravitationally unstable .",
    "consequently , the disk will develop prominent spiral arms trailing around through which the matter from the outer edge will be rapidly transported inward , to the disk inner regions @xcite .    in sections  [ disk_res ] and [ env_den ]",
    "we have claimed that presence of local high - density ( clump - like ) structures in the ab aur system is a necessary requirement to explain the peculiar shape of the hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) profiles in a region of the pdbi map and the high ratio of the single - dish iram cs(5 - 4 ) and cs(2 - 1 ) spectra .",
    "this suggestion is supported by the near - infrared _ subaru _ observations of @xcite that reveal the presence of a few spiral arms , a knotty structure , a dark lane , and underlying circular inhomogeneous structure in the ab aur system at @xmath439  au ( see fig .  3 therein ) .",
    "they have also found that these arms are trailing and concluded from similar arguments that we caught the gravitational instability at work in a protoplanetary disk .",
    "note that spiral density waves can also be produced by tidal interactions between the disk matter and hidden low - mass ( planetary ) companion(s ) .",
    "however , fukagawa et al . have ruled out such a possibility because otherwise a companion would have been detected .",
    "it is worth to mention here that recently @xcite have simulated the evolution of magnetized self - gravitating disks in 2d and 3d that show amazingly similar spiral structure as has been observed by @xcite ( compare figures 5 and 3 there , respectively ) .",
    "the continuous replenishment of the ab aur disk matter by `` fresh '' material from the envelope via inward accretion by the spiral arms provides a natural explanation for the observational fact that the bulk of dust grains in the disk are pristine and closely resemble the ism dust particles ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "actually , it can also be true for some other herbig ae / be systems as well .",
    "though this hypothesis should be carefully verified by future observations and modeling , it can explain why some herbig systems do not show significant grain evolution after several million years of the evolution , while other do .",
    "we observed the ab aur system at millimeter wavelengths and studied its chemical composition with the iram 30-m antenna and plateau de bure array during 2000 - 2002 .",
    "overall , nine different molecular species in a dozen rotational transitions were detected at low resolutions ( @xmath440-@xmath32 ) using the iram telescope : co , c@xmath0o , cs , hco@xmath1 , dco@xmath1 , h@xmath2co , hcn , hnc , and sio .",
    "from the measured negative intensity of the dco@xmath1(2 - 1 ) line , we found strong evidence that the ab aur envelope extends up to at least @xmath77  au from the star .",
    "in contrast , with pdbi we detected only the hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) emission from the ab aur disk at the modest @xmath311 resolution .",
    "the symmetric `` butterfly '' ( two - lobe ) appearance of the intensity - weighted velocity map is indicative of a rotating @xmath441 ( @xmath442  au ) disk that is seen close to face - on with a positional angle of @xmath443 . to account for these observational data",
    ", we used _ for the first time _ a coherent modeling of the disk and envelope physical structure , chemical evolution , and radiative transfer in molecular lines .",
    "first , we modeled the ab aur disk by the 2d flared passive disk model with vertical temperature gradient and keplerian rotation , using the 2d continuum radiative transfer code and observational facts and theoretical constraints from the literature . to represent the ab aur envelope , we adopted the infalling isothermal spherical cloud model with a central region shadowed by the disk and two wide cones transparent to the stellar radiation .",
    "second , for both the disk and envelope models , time - dependent abundances and column densities of observationally important molecules were calculated for 3  myr of the evolution with the gas - grain umist95 chemical network supplied by dust surface reactions , reactions of deuterium fractionation , and co and h@xmath2 shielding .",
    "after that , the calculated abundances of hco@xmath1 , co , c@xmath0o , and cs molecules were translated to the excitation temperatures of the co(2 - 1 ) , c@xmath0o(2 - 1 ) , hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) , hco@xmath1(3 - 2 ) , cs(2 - 1 ) , and cs(5 - 4 ) transitions by mean of the 2d non - lte line radiative transfer code . finally , with the same code we synthesized the beam - convolved hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) interferometric map and single - dish co(2 - 1 ) , c@xmath0o(2 - 1 ) , hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) , hco@xmath1(3 - 2 ) , cs(2 - 1 ) , and cs(5 - 4 ) lines and compared them _ directly _ with the observational data .",
    "iterating this modeling scheme about 30 times ( each run took @xmath338 days on a pentium iv 2.4ghz pc ) , we constrained the parameters of the ab aur system and their uncertainties by varying the model configurations in a robust step - by - step way .",
    "overall success of such an advanced and complicated theoretical approach to explain the observational data is surprising .",
    "the best - fit disk model reproduces the intensities , widths , and profiles of the observed hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) spectra on the entire interferometric map apart from one corner .",
    "there the line profiles show a fake absorption - emission shape that resembles the inverse p cygni profile .",
    "we suggested that this can be _ indirect _ evidence for a _ local _ inhomogeneity ( density enhancement ) of the nearby envelope at @xmath444  au .",
    "the constrained parameters of the ab aur disk are the following .",
    "the ab aur disk is in keplerian rotation and inclined by @xmath3 , whereas its position angle is @xmath4 .",
    "the uncertainties of the derived inclination angle are mainly caused by the uncertainty of the adopted stellar mass and spread in the radial gradient of the disk surface density .",
    "the radius of the disk is @xmath5  au and its mass is @xmath6 with a factor of @xmath7 uncertainty .",
    "the uncertainty of the constrained mass is mainly caused by possible variations of the gas - to - dust mass ratio and the size of dust grains in this object .",
    "the best - fit model of the ab aur disk and inner shadowed part of the envelope ( disk - in - envelope model ) successfully reproduces the intensities , widths , and profiles of the single - dish co(2 - 1 ) , c@xmath0o(2 - 1 ) , hco@xmath1(1 - 0 ) , hco@xmath1(3 - 2 ) , and cs(2 - 1 ) spectra with the exception of the cs(5 - 4 ) data , which can be fitted only by the model with clumps that have a characteristic density of about @xmath445  @xmath12 and homogeneously fill in @xmath392 of the full @xmath72 iram beam in the cs(5 - 4 ) transition .",
    "we found that the large @xmath225  kms@xmath43 width of the observed co(2 - 1 ) emission can not be explained by this model alone and is likely due to contamination by moving gas clouds along the line of sight to ab aur .",
    "the best - fit envelope model has a mean temperature of about @xmath9  k , power - law density distribution @xmath10 with the initial density of @xmath446  g@xmath12 at @xmath13  au , mass of the shielded region within @xmath447  au , @xmath448 , and total mass of about @xmath449 ( the latter three quantities are uncertain by a factor of @xmath7 ) . here ,",
    "the @xmath450  k uncertainty of the average envelope temperature is due to the @xmath246 - 15@xmath451 calibration errors in the observed co(2 - 1 ) flux and a @xmath335 uncertainty in the distance to ab aur .",
    "the estimated parameters of the ab aur disk and envelope are in reasonable agreement with other studies performed so far .",
    "furthermore , the applied step - by - step theoretical approach allowed to account for various observed interferometric and single - dish molecular spectra of ab aur _",
    "simultaneously_. we conclude that a comprehensive theoretical modeling of the observed interferometric maps obtained even with modest resolution offers an unique possibility to constrain the masses , sizes , orientation , and dynamical structure of young protoplanetary disks in an _ independent _ way .",
    "the same approach applied to single - dish spectra is capable in determining average temperature , density , and kinematical structures of the surrounding envelopes .",
    "moreover , our best - fit model predicts that the @xmath452  yr@xmath43 mass accretion to be in the ab aur system is regulated by steady contraction of the envelope that is only partly supported by rotation and magnetic field acting against gravitation .",
    "it also gives a rough estimate of the timescale for dispersal of the entire system , @xmath453  myr .",
    "we argue that the continuous mass supply from the infalling envelope onto rotating disk produces gravitational instabilities , resulting in a spiral disk structure , similar to that recently observed by @xcite and simulated with a 3d mhd code by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the continuous replenishment of the ab aur disk matter by the material from the surrounding envelope provides a straightforward explanation to the observational fact that most of the disk grains are pristine and resemble ism dust particles even after several myr of the evolution , which can also be true for other herbig ae / be systems .",
