    "r ara is an eclipsing binary with a period of just over 4.4 days and an apparent visual magnitude of 6.7 .",
    "a secondary eclipse has never been clearly seen at any wavelength .",
    "spectroscopically , r ara is single - lined at best , as the few lines that do follow the orbital motion of the primary deviate from it for much of the orbit .",
    "r ara s spectrum is plagued with blended absorption features and non - orbital motions .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ data on r ara indicate a parallax of @xmath0 mas , which puts it at a distance of roughly 80 pc .",
    "its proper motion is reported as @xmath1 in right ascension and @xmath2 in declination .",
    "r ara might be part of the upper centaurus - lupus ( ucl ) o - b association , but on the southern most edge .",
    "since the average distance to ucl members is about 140 pc , r ara would be either on the nearest edge of ucl or in the foreground .",
    "also , the proper motions of ucl members are somewhat greater than that of r ara but in the same direction . if a member of ucl , r ara s age could be estimated as roughly 15 million years .",
    "r ara was discovered in 1892 by alexander w. roberts at lovendale , at the time it was called `` lacaille 6887 '' , or `` no .",
    "( 5949 ) in chandler s catalog '' .",
    "it was reported as `` ( 5949 ) - arae ... an _",
    "algol_-variable '' by @xcite .",
    "the middle of the @xmath3 century saw more interest in r ara with photometric studies by @xcite and @xcite , and the first ( and extremely useful ) spectroscopic analysis by @xcite .",
    "hertzsprung found the orbital period of r ara to be @xmath4 with a primary minimum at jd 2,425,818.028 and payne - gaposchkin measured a @xmath5 period near another primary minimum at jd 2,429,433.348 .",
    "sahade s spectral analysis used 118 plates obtained between 1946 and 1951 , and he estimated the semi - amplitude of the primary star to be @xmath6 and the masses of the components to be @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "sahade s analysis determined the b9 classification of the primary .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ data provide support for sahade s classification determination of b9 . a star with r ara s apparent magnitude , at a distance of 80 pc ,",
    "would have an absolute magnitude of + 2.2 , which corresponds to a b9 main - sequence star .",
    "r ara s colour of b - v = -0.060 is also indicative of a b9 star .",
    "in addition , the zams model of such a b9 main sequence star yields a mass of @xmath9 to @xmath10 .    an original radial velocity ( rv ) plot by @xcite is shown in figure [ fig : sahaderv ] . these rvs appear to follow orbital motion of roughly 60 @xmath11 ( sahade s estimate for @xmath12 ) during the last quarter of the cycle , although there is no clear orbital motion seen in the plot .",
    "in section [ sec : uv spectroscopic analysis ] we provide a @xmath13 curve on our colour scale rv plots , not as a fit to the data but as an aid in comparing and contrasting the observed gas motions with estimated orbital motion .    the first _",
    "iue _ observations were discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "they reported p - cygni line profiles in the 1980 data that exhibit orbital variations , along with the presence of c iv and n v indicating high temperature regions .",
    "both findings suggest mass transfer processes .",
    "mccluskey and kondo also reported peculiar light variations seen in the 1982 _ iue _ data and in the photometric uv data from the astronomical netherlands satellite @xcite , and the presence of x - rays as seen with the einstein observatory @xcite .",
    "the results of these uv analyses spurred more ground - based photometric observations , as reported by groups in new zealand @xcite who analysed data taken at black birch outstation of carter observatory .",
    "nield determined an ephemeris for the year 1986 , for r ara , of @xmath14 and she found that a phase shift for primary minimum may have occurred .",
    "we are very fortunate to have her analysis because her ephemeris fits the _ iue _ data better than the earlier ( 1952 ) ephemeris by payne - gaposchkin , and therefore gives us more accurate orbital phase values than were used in the analysis of mccluskey and kondo in the early 1980s .",
    "one of nield s original visual light curves is shown in figure [ fig : nieldrv ] .",
    "see @xcite , pages 246 - 247 , for the parameters of her model . while her model provides an excellent fit to the primary eclipse , the outside - of - eclipse portion of the light curve",
    "is left essentially un - modeled .",
    "also , nield s model does not allow for roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) and therefore does not give r ara the status of an interacting system at all .",
    "@xcite produced a similar model using visual data with an eccentricity - shifted ( e = 0.42 ) secondary eclipse and a hot spot to explain the increase in brightness before the primary eclipse , but this does not account for the other variations , especially those around first quadrature , nor does it account for rlof .",
    "it should be noted that such high eccentricities are quite unusual for systems with periods shorter than 5 - 7 days because these systems are so close that tidal dampening would quickly set the eccentricity to zero .",
    "while it might be possible for extremely rapid mass transfer to drive a non - zero eccentricity , the high eccentricity reported by banks is most likely in fact spurious .",
    "a recent paper by @xcite describes some optical spectroscopic observations of r ara taken in 1991 .",
    "the description of the data is similar to that of @xcite , characteristic of badly blended absorption and emission lines .",
    "arias suggests that the entire system is engulfed in a circumbinary envelope .",
    "this paper focuses on _ iue _ data taken in 1985 and 1989 , none of which has ever been studied before .",
    "these observations were well planned as they reveal r ara in the uv during critical parts of its orbit . in section [ sec : uv light curve analysis ] we make sense of r ara s strange photometric variations by modeling it with a cool accretion structure surrounding the hot primary star .",
    "section [ sec : uv spectroscopic analysis ] tracks the motions of both hot ( too hot for b9 stars ) and cool ( too cool for b9 stars ) regions .",
    "we provide the most detailed evidence to date for the existence of a transient quasi - disc - like accretion structure delivering matter from the less massive secondary star to the more massive primary in r ara .",
    "we have detected a hot region on the primary that is due to the impact of the mass - transfer stream which drives a `` hot river '' around the primary s equator .",
    "the high resolution _ iue _",
    "images are listed in tables [ tab:1980iue ] through [ tab:1991iue ] , and the orbital phase coverage is also given in those tables .",
    "the 1989 data are particularly useful because there are 36 consecutive spectra spanning one orbital cycle .",
    "such coverage is not obtainable from the ground , and is free from many secular variations which are prominent for r ara .",
    "because these 1989 images are fairly evenly distributed through the orbit , they were used to construct uv light curves and rv plots .",
    "the _ iue _",
    "data from 1985 are concentrated near secondary eclipse , another beneficial circumstance .",
    "the short - wave primary ( swp ) camera detected wavelengths of 1150 @xmath15 2000   while the long - wave primary ( lwp ) and long - wave redundant ( lwr ) cameras covered 1850 @xmath15 3400  .",
    "all of the _ iue _ data are available in the _ newsips _ archive .",

    ". support for mast for non - hst data is provided by the nasa office of space science via grant nag5 - 7584 and by other grants and contracts .",
    "we also observed a recent primary eclipse of r ara in 2008 in order to check for an ongoing phase shift and apparent period increase .",
    "the observations were made with the prompt5 telescope @xcite .",
    "twelve sets of ten , one - second exposures were taken at 30 minute intervals , in the v filter .",

    "it can not be a constant thickness through time either , or we would not see the secular variations that we do . rather , r ara s accretion structure must be more transient and asymmetric .    the asymmetry of the accretion structure around the primary , proposed in our model ( top of figure [ fig : structure ] ) , is similar to that found by @xcite in their hydrodynamic simulations of the interacting system @xmath18 lyr . coupling this asymmetry with",
    "the system s inclination may explain the orbital variations in r ara s light curve .",
    "the cool clouds in the restricted bm3 model would correspond to where the accretion structure is closest to the primary and is therefore in the line of sight to it , while the farther regions of the cloud descend below our line of sight to the star revealing more of its hot equator .",
    "the alternative explanation that would not rely on the inclination and asymmetry would be that there are higher density concentrations in the accretion structure at the location of the `` spots '' in our bm3 model .",
    "the transient nature of the accretion structure , proposed by our model to account for secular variations , is consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "they found that algol - type binaries with periods shorter than r ara s , such as @xmath18 per ( p = 2.9 days ) , exhibit mass - transfer streams that strike the accreting star more directly and do not form stable accretion discs . at the same time , they find that the mass transfer in algols with periods longer than r ara s , like tt hya ( p = 6.9 days ) , does not create a direct impact and therefore quickly produces a stable accretion disc . an interacting system like r ara , with a 4.4 day period ,",
    "might find itself varying between a `` @xmath18 per - like '' state and a `` tt hya - like '' state .",
    "we propose that the accretion rate onto the primary in r ara is variable . during times of rapid accretion",
    ", the transfer stream strikes the primary directly and produces a thinner accretion structure .",
    "this should correspond to brighter epochs , like 1982 .",
    "as the accretion structure builds up , during times of slower accretion onto the primary , it will `` push '' the mass - transfer stream away from the star causing a less direct impact and a thicker accretion structure .",
    "this latter case will cause the system to appear dimmer overall , like in 1989 . as the accretion rate increases",
    ", the stream may return to the more direct impact state and the system will become brighter again .    for completeness , we have included synthetic light curves of our bm3 model under two further conditions , in figure [ fig : vis - ns - lc ] .",
    "the dotted line is our model , at 1320  , but without any cool clouds ( or `` spots '' in bm3 ) eclipsing the primary .",
    "this is essentially what nield s model would look like in the uv .",
    "note that the secondary eclipse should almost vanish at 1320  .",

    "is our bm3 model , cool clouds included , as viewed at 5500  , in the visual .",
    "indeed , our model can be extended into the visual region to explain the `` hump '' before primary minumum , the wide and apparently shifted `` secondary eclipse '' , and the other variations near first quadrature .",
    "our observation of the 16 march 2008 primary eclipse of r ara confirms the ongoing period increase detected by nield . in section [ sec : descussion ] we estimate r ara s rates of period change and mass transfer .",
    "we have proposed a model for r ara to explain its strange variations in brightness . in the following section we put our photometric model to the test through our analysis of r ara s spectral features .",
    "are the motions of the cooler ions consistent with our proposed accretion structure and are the motions of the hotter ions consistent with our proposed `` hot river '' driven around the primary s equator by the impact of the mass - transfer stream ?",
    "in section [ sec : uv light curve analysis ] we proposed a model for r ara consisting of an undetected f to k type secondary undergoing rlof and donating mass to the more massive b9 primary .",
    "the mass - transfer stream strikes the primary , either directly or at more of a glancing angle , which drives a `` hot river '' around the primary s equator .",
    "the imact site and equator are where we would expect to find the hotter ions , like n v and c iv , which require much hotter ( @xmath19 30,000 k ) plasmas than are typically found in late b - type stars .",
    "the ions that are too cool for a b9 , such as ni ii and fe ii , should be found in the accretion structure .",

    "again , the 1989 images cover a full cycle and are ideal for studying orbital variations . just after primary minimum , around phase 0.05 to 0.1 , the strength of the n v line decreases while that of the ni ii reaches a maximum .",
    "this is the phase when the accretion structure is most optically thick in our line of sight to the primary .",
    "later , at around phase 0.4 , the n v line strengths reach a maximum while the ni ii is quite weak .",
    "this , according to our model , is when the hot equator of the primary is exposed to us and the cool accretion structure is mostly below our line of sight .",

    ", the impact of the stream may cause a splashing of material over the primary .",
    "this would behave like an asymmetric `` wind '' , seen when the splashing material is projected onto the hot star .",
    "since a stellar wind is detected as a p - cygni line profile , any asymmetric p - cygni lines may be caused by this splashing .",
    "the p - cygni features of 1980 , noted by mccluskey and kondo , appear at phases 0.07 and 0.23 but not at any other phases . during these phases we are looking at the system from behind the secondary , with a view from above the impact region .",
    "there are no p - cygni features in the 1989 data even at similar phases .",
    "this is a secular spectroscopic variation supporting our explanation of the secular photometric variations .",

    "the rate of period increase between the two epochs is then : @xmath30 from this we find @xmath31 , which corresponds to a timescale of roughly @xmath32 years for this phase of r ara s evolution ; a very short - lived stage .    if we assume the masses of the stars to be @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( these are sahade s original estimates , but they are also consistent with the mass ratios used both in nield s photometric model and our photometric model in this paper ) , and if we assume conservative mass transfer , we can use the equation from @xcite to get a mass transfer rate of : @xmath35 which is much more rapid than typical algols .",
    "in fact , at this rate of mass transfer the secondary would lose half of its current mass in just a few hundred thousand years .",
    "we believe r ara is in the pre - algol stage of its evolution , just past the reversal of mass ratio , which would be characterised by rapid mass transfer and an unstable , transient accretion structure .",
    "we project that r ara s mass transfer rate will eventually slow down as it enters a more stable state . at that time , r ara may become a classic algol type binary star .",
    "many frequent times of primary minima are desired in order to more accurately track a change in the orbital period of r ara and to ultimately conduct a complete o - c analysis .",
    "spectroscopic data for use in constructing doppler tomograms would also be of great benefit to visualize r ara s mass flow and accretion structure .",
