    "debris disks were discovered in main - sequence stars by infrared excess over the photospheric emission in observations by _ iras _ in the 1980s . since debris disks",

    "debris disks are also important as a probe of planetesimals , building blocks of planets , in extra - solar systems .",

    "we present an mir low resolution spectrum of the main - sequence star hd165014 obtained with _ spitzer_/irs .",

    "we report the detection of abundant crystalline enstatite ( mgsio@xmath6 ) dust compared to forsterite toward the star and discuss the origin of the debris dust around hd165014 .",
    "the s9w ( 9@xmath1 ) and l18w ( 18@xmath1 ) images of hd165014 were taken with the irc @xcite on board _ akari _ @xcite as part of the all - sky survey observations from 2006 may to 2007 august @xcite .",
    "the 5@xmath7 sensitivity for a point source per scan is estimated to be 50  mjy in the s9w band and 90  mjy in the l18w band , and the typical absolute uncertainty in flux density is @xmath8% for the s9w band and @xmath9% for the l18w band at present .",
    "hd165014 was observed twice in the survey with the interval of 6 months and the fluxes at the two periods agree with each other within the uncertainty , indicating no significant variations in the flux .",
    "the position accuracy and spatial resolution is estimated to be better than @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , securely concluding that the _ akari _ source is associated with hd165014 .",
    "hd165014 was selected as a candidate of warm debris disk with large 18@xmath1 excess by a search in the _ akari_/irc all - sky survey data @xcite .",
    "irs observations of hd165014 were made on 2008 november 5 ( aor i d 26122752 ) .",
    "all the four low - resolution modules , short - low 2 ( sl2 ; 5.2 - 7.7@xmath1 ) and short - low 1 ( sl1 ; 7.4 - 14.5@xmath1 ) , long - low 2 ( ll2 ; 14.0 - 21.3@xmath1 ) and long - low 1 ( ll1 ; 19.5 - 38.0@xmath1 ) , were used to obtain a full @xmath12 low - resolution ( @xmath13 ) spectrum .",

    "* ) mounted on the 8 m subaru telescope on 2008 july 16 and 17 .",
    "imaging observations in the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 bands were carried out .",
    "the secondary mirror chopping method was used for the background cancellation .",
    "we used standard stars ( @xmath19  aql and @xmath20  sco ) from @xcite as a flux calibrator and the reference point - spread functions were derived from the observations .",
    "we observed the standard stars before or after the observations of hd165014 in the same manner as hd165014 .",
    "for the data reduction , we used our own reduction tools and iraf @xcite .",
    "the standard chop pair subtraction and the shift - and - add method in units of 0.1 pixel were employed .",
    "we applied airmass correction using atran @xcite .",
    "the derived flux densities are summarized in table  [ photometry ] .",
    "the photospheric flux density of hd165014 is estimated from the kurucz model @xcite fitted to the @xmath21- and two micron all sky survey @xcite @xmath22-band photometry of the star taking account of the extinction .",
    "the only available spectral classification of hd165014 ( f2v ) is provided by the michigan catalog @xcite .",
    "we reexamine the spectral type of the star by the photospheric fitting .",
    "we use the kurucz models of various spectral - type dwarfs for the stellar photospheric template of hd165014 and the distance @xmath23 and the extinction @xmath24 are set free .",
    "we adopt an extinction curve @xmath25 given by @xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the extinction toward the star at a wavelength @xmath28 ( in @xmath29 ) and the ratio of the total to the selective extinction @xmath30 is assumed as @xmath31 .",
    "the photospheric fitting shows that the @xmath32-band photometry of hd165014 is well accounted for with almost the same significance by spectral types between b8v ( @xmath33  k ) with @xmath34 at @xmath35  pc and f2v ( @xmath36  k ) with @xmath37 at @xmath38  pc .",
    "it is difficult to determine the spectral type of the star more accurately only from photometric data due to its large extinction and optical high - resolution spectroscopy is required for further examination .",
    "an earlier spectral type at a larger distance seems more reasonable for hd165014 , taking account of the large amount of extinction . in the following",
    "we assume a0v ( with @xmath39 and @xmath40  pc ) as the spectral type of hd165014 rather than f2v given by the michigan catalog .",
    "the estimated extinction @xmath39 is still large for a star at 140  pc , suggesting that part of extinction may be of circumstellar origin .",
    "the derived photospheric flux density from the fitting in each mir band , which does not depend on the spectral type sensitively ( only a few percent of variation from b8v to f2v ) , is listed in table  [ photometry ] .",
    "the obtained _ spitzer_/irs spectrum of the star is shown in figure  [ sed ] together with the _ akari _ and subaru / comics photometry .",
    "the measurements of the _ msx _ counterpart ( msx6c g009.0807 + 00.3009 ) and the _ spitzer_/irac glimpse ii counterpart ( sstglmc g009.0801 + 00.3011 ) are also shown in figure  [ sed ] .",
    "most of the mir flux densities are in good agreement with each other , while those of _ akari _",
    "18@xmath1 band and _",

    "the expected photospheric emission is also plotted in figure  [ sed ] .",
    "significant excess emission at wavelengths longer than 5@xmath1 is clearly seen .",
    "the detected flux densities at 9 and 18@xmath1 are 10 and 30 times larger than the photosphere , respectively , unambiguously indicating the presence of a warm and bright debris disk .",
    "the slope of the observed spectrum at @xmath41 is consistent with that of the rayleigh - jeans side of a blackbody , suggesting the dust temperature of @xmath42  k and the truncation of the disk at the radius where the dust temperature is @xmath43  k.    one of the observable indicators of dust abundance is its fractional luminosity , a ratio of the infrared luminosity from the disk to the stellar luminosity .",
    "the fractional luminosity of hd165014 is estimated as @xmath44 .",
    "it is comparable to @xmath45  pic @xcite , suggesting that hd165014 is one of the brightest debris disks discovered so far .",
    "the location of the star , deep in the galactic plane , makes it difficult to find until the _ akari _ survey .      to examine the excess emission ,",
    "we subtract the expected photospheric emission from the observed irs spectrum .",
    "the photosphere - subtracted spectrum shows significant emission features centered at around 10 and 20@xmath1 . a ubiquitous dust species family , silicate , which has features around @xmath46 ( due to si - o stretching modes ) and @xmath47 ( due to o - si - o bending modes ) , seems to be a main carrier of the observed features .",
    "particularly , the spectrum shows several fine - structured features attributable to crystalline silicates .    to investigate the details of the features ,",
    "figure  [ em ] plots the normalized emissivity of the excess emission of hd165014 by dividing the photosphere - subtracted spectrum by a blackbody ( @xmath48 ) of a temperature @xmath49 , where @xmath49 is chosen so that the spectrum level of the feature - free region ( 8.0 and @xmath50 for the top panel , and 13.5 and @xmath51 for the bottom panel of figure  [ em ] ) becomes almost flat .",
    "the chosen @xmath49 is 560 and 330  k for the top and bottom panels of figure  [ em ] , respectively . for comparison , spectra of crystalline enstatite , forsterite @xcite , and fused silica @xcite",
    "are also plotted in figure  [ em ] .",
    "a significant broad feature is seen at 9@xmath52 in the spectrum .",
    "since the width of this feature is large ( fwhm @xmath53 ) , it seems to originate from @xmath29-sized amorphous silicate rather than sub-@xmath29-sized silicate @xcite .",
    "in addition , some peaks are also seen on the broad feature .",
    "the most significant peak is located at @xmath54 , and the second at @xmath55 .",
    "weaker narrow features are also seen around 11.1@xmath56 .",
    "the positions of all the narrow features are consistent with the spectrum of crystalline enstatite .",
    "the @xmath57 feature of crystalline forsterite , which is the most common form of crystalline silicate , is not seen in the excess emission of hd165014 .",
    "only weak narrow features are seen around 11.1@xmath56 , where a strong crystalline forsterite feature is expected , in the spectrum of hd165014 .    to analyze the @xmath58-band spectrum quantitatively and confirm the identification of the features described above",
    ", we make a simple spectral model fitting of the derived emissivity at 8@xmath59 .",
    "we consider four dust species , crystalline forsterite and enstatite @xcite and amorphous olivine and pyroxene @xcite , in our model fit .",
    "the model spectrum is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are the absorption efficiencies of amorphous olivine , amorphous pyroxene , crystalline forsterite , and crystalline enstatite , respectively",
    ". the scaling factors , @xmath63s , are free parameters ( @xmath64 is the contribution of continuum ) . for amorphous olivine and pyroxene ,",
    "we choose one dust size from 0.1 , 1.0 , 1.5 , or 2.0@xmath1 , whose absorption coefficients are computed from the optical constants of @xcite based the mie theory @xcite .",
    "we employ a least - squares minimization method to determine the most likely parameters . a model with 2.0@xmath1 sized amorphous silicates",
    "is found to provide the best fit among all the considered dust sizes of amorphous silicates .",
    "the derived best - fit parameters are @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "the best - fit model spectrum is shown in the top panel of figure  [ bestfit ] , indicating that the @xmath58-band spectrum of hd165014 is well reproduced by the model spectrum .",
    "the broad and narrow features seen in the observed spectrum are indeed attributed to @xmath67 sized amorphous pyroxene and crystalline enstatite , respectively .",
    "the contribution of forsterite dust is small and the mass ratio of forsterite to enstatite is estimated as @xmath68 .    in the longer wavelength region of the spectrum ,",
    "a significant trapezoidal feature is seen at 17@xmath69 , which is very similar to the enstatite spectrum .",
    "a broad feature seen around @xmath70 also seems to originate from enstatite .",
    "a weak feature is seen around @xmath71 , which may be accounted for by both forsterite and enstatite .",
    "the feature around @xmath71 might be attributable to forsterite ; forsterite , if any , is less abundant than enstatite since the feature is very weak .",
    "silica features at @xmath72 and 20@xmath73 are not seen in the excess emission of hd165014 .",
    "the observed features and their identifications are summarized in table  [ feature ] . from the overall shape of the mir excess spectrum of hd165014",
    ", we conclude that most of the fine features are attributable to crystalline enstatite and that forsterite is much less abundant than enstatite around the star .",
    "the feature - to - continuum ratios in the 10 and @xmath69 regions are @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "the contribution from the continuum component is large in the excess emission of hd165014 , suggesting the presence of abundant featureless large dust grains ( @xmath76 in size ) around the star .      in the top panel of figure  [ em ] ,",
    "a rising continuum toward shorter wavelengths @xmath77 is seen , suggesting the presence of hotter ( @xmath78  k ) materials around the star .",
    "although the rising continuum might also be attributable to amorphous carbon , whose emissivity rises toward shorter wavelengths in the nir and mir @xcite , no more discussion can be given with the present data .",
    "the temperature of the hottest component is estimated as @xmath79  k from a fitting of the @xmath80 excess spectrum with a single - temperature blackbody assuming that the @xmath80 excess is coming from the innermost hottest region .",
    "therefore dust grains are distributed in the region with temperatures of @xmath81  k around hd165014 .",
    "the inner and outer radii of the debris disk are estimated as @xmath82  au and @xmath83  au , respectively , by assuming that the debris dust is a blackbody particle .",
    "possible large circumstellar extinction suggests that the disk is seen nearly edge - on .",
    "as mentioned above , it is evident that crystalline enstatite is abundant in the debris disk around hd165014 and forsterite features are not clearly seen . @xcite conduct a comprehensive mir spectroscopic survey of debris disks . among their 59 debris disk samples , five objects ( hr3927 , @xmath84  crv , hd113766 , hr7012 , and @xmath84  tel ) are found to possess spectral features that are well - modeled by @xmath29-sized amorphous and crystalline silicates .",
    "forsterite features are dominant compared to enstatite toward four samples ( hr3927 , @xmath84  crv , hd113766 , and @xmath84  tel ) .",
    "hr7012 , which shows a very strong peak at 9.1@xmath85 in its spectrum , was initially modeled by enstatite - rich silicate by @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite conclude that the observed 9.1@xmath85 feature originates from abundant silica grains and that the feature strengths of enstatite and forsterite are almost comparable .",
    "although there are a few additional debris disk stars with significant dust features in the @xmath58-band ( @xmath45  pic , hip8920 , hd145263 ; * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no sample with high abundance of enstatite is reported to date .",
    "hd165014 is the only known debris disk that shows strong enstatite features compared to forsterite .    in the solar system",
    ", a number of achondrite meteorites , which are primarily composed of enstatite , named aubrites , have been discovered .",
    "e - type asteroids are thought to have enstatite achondrite surfaces and to be parent bodies of aubrites ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) based on their reflection spectra .",
    "e - type asteroids form a large proportion of asteroids inward of the main belt known as hungaria asteroids and are believed to be fragments of differentiated larger bodies that were heated at least to 1700  k @xcite . considering that enstatite is dominant around hd165014 rather than forsterite ,",
    "the observed debris dust may originate from an analog of e - type asteroids in the solar system , being harmonic with the idea that the debris disk is formed by means of collisions between asteroids @xcite .",
    "it is also known that mercury s surface is rich in enstatite @xcite .",
    "if a mercury - like planet exists around hd165014 and a mechanism to scatter the surface material of the planet , for example infall of small bodies , occurs , an enstatite - rich debris disk might be formed .",
    "it should also be noted that mercury s high density is interpreted as a result of stripping of the surface crustal material @xcite .",
    "the possible link between the debris material around hd165014 and mercury needs to be further explored .",
    "although a number of mir spectra of protoplanetary disks associated with younger stars , herbig ae / be and t tau stars , have been collected so far , objects that show enstatite features are rare .",
    "hd179218 is a herbig ae / be star , which has the most enstatite - rich spectrum known to date @xcite .",
    "we show the @xmath58-band spectrum of hd179218 obtained with timmi2 @xcite in the bottom panel of figure  [ bestfit ] . while crystalline enstatite features are clearly seen in the spectrum , features at 9.85 and @xmath86 attributable to forsterite are also seen with comparable strengths as enstatite , suggesting the presence of abundant crystalline forsterite as well as enstatite .",
    "annealing experiments of a magnesium silicate smoke made by @xcite show that the initially formed forsterite and silica react with each other and form enstatite by the following reaction @xmath87 @xcite suggest that the presence of enstatite around hd179218 might be due to the high luminosity ( @xmath88 ) , which gives rise to rapid dispersal of the gas , resulting in a high efficiency of the reaction .",
    "@xcite suggest that enstatite might be produced by means of chemical equilibrium processes in high temperature environments , i.e. , inner regions of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "@xcite show that crystalline enstatite can be produced by simultaneous evaporation of sio grains and mg vapor in a plasma in laboratory experiments .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the turbulence in disks is attributed to the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that at least part of the disk is sufficiently ionized ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore the formation process of crystalline enstatite suggested by @xcite may work efficiently in protoplanetary disks .",
    "it is possible that crystalline enstatite grains produced in the protoplanetary disk were once stored in small bodies such as comets and have been released recently in the hd165014 system .",
    "indeed crystalline enstatite is detected toward some comets in the solar system by astronomical mir observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as by the stardust sample return mission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , it remains an open question why crystalline forsterite is depleted around hd165014 .",
    "further experimental and theoretical studies are required to discuss the origin of abundant crystalline enstatite in the debris disk around hd165014 in detail .",
    "this research is in part based on observations with _",
    "akari _ , a jaxa project with the participation of esa .",

    "<S> the star possesses extremely large excess emission at wavelengths longer than 5@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the detected flux densities at 10 and 20@xmath1 are @xmath2 and @xmath3 times larger than the predicted photospheric emission , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the excess emission is attributable to the presence of circumstellar warm dust . </S>",
    "<S> the dust temperature is estimated as 300750  k , corresponding to the distance of 0.74.4  au from the central star . </S>",
    "<S> significant fine - structured features are seen in the spectrum and the peak positions are in good agreement with those of crystalline enstatite </S>",
    "<S> . features of crystalline forsterite are not significantly seen . </S>",
    "<S> hd165014 is the first debris disk sample that has enstatite as a dominant form of crystalline silicate rather than forsterite . </S>",
    "<S> possible formation of enstatite dust from differentiated parent bodies is suggested according to the solar system analog . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of an enstatite - rich debris disk in the current study suggests the presence of large bodies and a variety of silicate dust processing in warm debris disks . </S>"
