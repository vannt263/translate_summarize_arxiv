    "this is the theorem of complex multiplication of shimura  @xcite .",
    "we outline the proof of the first statement , for which we work via the modular @xmath69-function .",
    "we have that @xmath70 is in the hilbert class field @xmath71 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ii , 4.3 ) ) and similarly with  @xmath72 .",
    "thus we get that @xmath73 over @xmath71 contains the moduli point corresponding to the isogeny between curves with these @xmath69-invariants .",
    "since the modular parametrisation map @xmath74 can be defined over the rationals , the image of the moduli point under @xmath74 has its coordinates in the hilbert class field .",
    "note that @xmath75 , so that there is no danger of confusing complex conjugation in  @xmath50 with complex conjugation of the coordinates of the point on  @xmath43 . using the third fact of theorem  [ thm : cm ] , we can take the trace of  @xmath62 and get a point that has coordinates in  @xmath63 .",
    "indeed , writing @xmath71 for the hilbert class field and @xmath76 for the imaginary quadratic field @xmath63 we get that @xmath77 has coordinates in  @xmath63 .",
    "when @xmath43 has odd functional equation , we can use the first two facts of theorem  [ thm : cm ] to show that  @xmath78 , so that @xmath79 has coordinates in  @xmath80 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath81 which implies  @xmath82 , so that in @xmath50 we have @xmath83 which gives us that @xmath84 we can rewrite some of this by introducing some new notation .",
    "we write @xmath85 for subset of @xmath13 such that the associated form @xmath3 has @xmath42 ( mod  @xmath34 ) .",
    "we write @xmath86 , and noting that @xmath25 acts on @xmath85 , we write @xmath87 .",
    "since @xmath88 is in 1 - 1 correspondence with @xmath89 , we get that @xmath90",
    "we now have a plan of how to find a non - torsion point on a curve of analytic rank  1 .",
    "we select an auxiliary negative fundamental discriminant  @xmath9 such that @xmath9 is a square modulo  @xmath24 , choose  @xmath91 , find @xmath1-representatives for  @xmath88 , compute @xmath92 for each , sum these in @xmath50 , map the resulting point to @xmath43 via the weierstrass parametrization , and try to recognize the result as a rational point .",
    "one problem is that we might get a torsion point .",
    "another problem is that we wo nt necessarily get a generator , and thus the point might have inflated height , which would increase our requirements on real - number precision .",
    "the gross - zagier theorem tells us what height to expect , and combined with the birch  swinnerton - dyer conjecture , we get a prediction of what height a generator should have",
    ". our heights will be the `` larger '' ones , and are thus twice those chosen by some authors .",
    "suppose @xmath93 is a fundamental discriminant with @xmath9 a square modulo  @xmath24 and @xmath94 .",
    "then @xmath95    this is due to gross and zagier  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath96 is the quadratic twist of  @xmath43 by  @xmath9 , while @xmath97 is the number of units in @xmath63 and @xmath98 is the number of distinct prime factors of  @xmath99 .",
    "calculations of gross and hayashi  @xcite indicate that this height formula is likely to be true for all negative fundamental discriminants  @xmath9 that are square mod  @xmath24 .",
    "we now write @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a generator times a generator from our method , since we can not disassociate @xmath102 from the regulator in the birch  swinnerton - dyer formula . ] and @xmath103 is a torsion point , so that @xmath104",
    ". then we replace @xmath105 through use of the birch  swinnerton - dyer conjecture  @xcite to get the following : over  @xmath106  thus it is 1 for curves with negative discriminant and 2 for curves with positive discriminant . ]    with notations as above we have that @xmath107    in particular , we note that we should use a quadratic twist  @xmath96 that has rank zero , so that @xmath108 does not vanish .",
    "the existence of such a twist is proven in  @xcite .",
    "thus we have the following algorithm , which we shall work on improving .    given a rational elliptic curve  @xmath43 of conductor  @xmath8 of analytic rank  1 , find a non - torsion rational point .    1 .",
    "compute @xmath105 and find a fundamental discriminant @xmath109 with @xmath9 a square modulo  @xmath24 and @xmath110 , so that the index  @xmath111 is nonzero .",
    "2 .   choose @xmath91 and compute ( to sufficient precision ) the complex number @xmath112 3 .",
    "let @xmath113 be the gcd of  @xmath111 and the exponent of the torsion group of  @xmath43 . if the discriminant of @xmath43 is positive , check if @xmath114 is close to a rational point on  @xmath43 for @xmath115 for both @xmath116 if the discriminant of @xmath43 is negative , let @xmath117 and check @xmath114 for @xmath118 over the same .",
    "one can compute the index  @xmath111 in parallel with the  @xmath92 , since both involve computing the @xmath119 of the elliptic curve  @xmath43 .",
    "however , this can cause problems if the index turns out to be zero ( that is , if @xmath96 has positive rank ) .",
    "we now discuss how to do the second step efficiently .",
    "first note that we can sometimes pair @xmath92 with its complex conjugate ; recalling that @xmath82 , by theorem  [ thm : cm ] in @xmath50 we have @xmath120 for @xmath121 we write  @xmath122 , so that when  @xmath123 in the class group we have @xmath124 and thus @xmath125 in  @xmath50 .",
    "we refer to this as * pairing * the forms .",
    "for @xmath126 to converge rapidly , we wish for the imaginary parts of our representative  @xmath1 s to be large .",
    "it turns out the best we can do is essentially have the smallest imaginary part be about @xmath127 in size .",
    "we can achieve this via a trick of delaunay , which introduces more atkin - lehner involutions .",
    "let @xmath128 with @xmath129 , and let @xmath130 be such that @xmath131 .",
    "the atkin - lehner involution @xmath132 sends @xmath1 to @xmath133 .",
    "this defines @xmath132 up to transformations by elements in  @xmath25 .",
    "one can check that @xmath134 is in the @xmath25-orbit of  @xmath1 , and that the @xmath132 form an elementary abelian 2-group  @xmath135 of order  @xmath136 .",
    "the important fact about the @xmath132 s that we shall use is that , so that @xmath137 .",
    "the sign can be computed as @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the local root number of  @xmath43 at  @xmath140 .",
    "delaunay s idea is to maximise the imaginary part of  @xmath1 over @xmath25 and @xmath135 rather than just @xmath25 ; the difficulty is that the action of @xmath132 need not preserve  @xmath141 .",
    "however , we still have that @xmath142 for the analogue of the second part of theorem  [ thm : cm ] , we need to consider what happens with to  @xmath141 .",
    "we define @xmath143 as follows .",
    "we make @xmath143 and @xmath141 have opposite signs mod  @xmath144 for prime powers  @xmath144 with @xmath145 and  @xmath146 , and else @xmath147 . in particular",
    ", we have that  @xmath148 when  @xmath8 is odd .",
    "the desired analogue is now that @xmath149.\\ ] ]    the primes @xmath140 which divide @xmath9 are different since there is only one square root of  @xmath9 mod  @xmath140 ; thus @xmath141 is preserved upon application of  @xmath132 for @xmath150 that are products of such primes . for such  @xmath150",
    ", we can note the following with respect to complex conjugation .",
    "suppose we have that @xmath151 so that by we have @xmath152 .",
    "then , using the fact that @xmath153 in this case , in @xmath50 we have , up to torsion , that @xmath154 so we see that @xmath155 can be paired iff @xmath156 can be paired .",
    "we now give the algorithm for finding good   the idea to run over all forms @xmath157 of discriminant  @xmath9 with @xmath158 small , mapping these via the appropriate atkin - lehner involution(s ) to forms with fixed square root  @xmath141 , and doing this until the images cover the class group .",

    "the most nave method for this is simply to try to recognise the @xmath186-coordinate as a rational number .",
    "if our height calculation tells us to expect a point whose has a numerator and denominator of about @xmath71 digits , the use of continued fractions will recognise it if we do all computations to about twice the precision , or @xmath187  digits .",
    "we can note that by using a map to @xmath188 and lattice reduction , this can be reduced to @xmath189 digits for every  @xmath190  we will discuss a similar idea later when we consider combining descent with our heegner point computations .",
    "but in this case we can do better ; we are able to recognise our rational point with only @xmath71 digits of precision due to a trick of cremona , coming from an idea in a paper of silverman  @xcite .",
    "the idea is that we know the canonical height of our desired point , and this height decomposes into local heights ; we have @xmath191 the height at infinity @xmath192 can be approximated from a real - number approximation to  @xmath79 , and there are finitely many possibilities for each local height @xmath193 depending the reduction type of  @xmath43 at  @xmath140 .",
    "we compute the various local heights to @xmath71 digits of precision , and then can determine the denominator of @xmath194 from this , our task being eased from the fact that it is square .",
    "then from our real - approximation , the techniques of @xcite ( see theorem  4 in particular ) can reduce the needed precision of the real heegner approximation to @xmath195 as  @xmath196 .",
    "the idea is that for a fixed  @xmath197 the equation defines a _ transcendental _ arc , and thus the use of a sufficiently high degree veronese embedding will reduce the needed precision substantially .",
    "this method in its entirety might not be that practical , though the use of height information in conjunction with the geometry of the curve should allow a useful reduction in precision .",

    ", there can be many choices for the sums of local heights , and if additionally the index is large , then this step can be quite time - consuming .",
    "this can be curtailed a bit by doing the calculations for the square root of the denominator of the @xmath186-coordinate to only about @xmath199  digits , and then not bothering with the elliptic exponential step unless the result is sufficiently close to an integer .",
    "we now give a complete example .",
