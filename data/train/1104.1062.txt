    "high resolution spectra of the bright seyfert 1 galaxy obtained by   and  over the past decade have detected soft x - ray absorption lines indicating a typical outflow velocity of @xmath0500 - 600 km s@xmath1 , with occasional higher blue shifts of up to @xmath04600 km s@xmath1 ( collinge 2001 , ogle  2004 , pounds  2004 , steenbrugge  2009 ) .",
    "a new and much longer  observation of  in 2009 has now revealed a high resolution soft x - ray spectrum with outflow velocities up to @xmath09000 km s@xmath1 . in pounds and vaughan ( 2011 ) ,",
    "hereafter paper i , we interpreted an observed correlation of outflow velocity and ionisation state in terms of a decelerating and recombining flow , resulting from the shocking of a still higher velocity wind colliding with the ism or slower moving ejecta .",
    "the high sensitivity of the 2009  observation also found several strong and broad emission lines , all showing evidence of self - absorption near the line cores .",
    "broad soft x - ray emission lines have previously been reported for  ( ogle  2004 , steenbrugge  2009 ) , and for several other seyfert 1 galaxies ( kaastra  2002 , costantini  2007 , smith  2007 ) , being interpreted in each case as arising in the inner part of the optical / uv broad line region .    in the present paper we model the broad emission lines in and consider an alternative origin in a limb - brightened shell of shocked gas .",
    "we note , furthermore , that self absorption in the shell also offers a natural explanation for a separate low velocity absorption component , seen across a wide range of ionisation states and found in paper i to break the main velocity - ionisation correlation .",
    "a limitation common to many studies of agn outflows , which bears directly on estimates of mass , energy and momentum , and hence on agn feedback , arises from a degeneracy between the radius and particle density of ionised gas in the flow .",
    "attempts to break this degeneracy by detecting flux - linked changes in the ionisation state of the absorbing gas have generally been inconclusive . while we find the broad line emission in  to remain quasi - constant , as the continuum flux changes by an order of magnitude , several radiative recombination continua ( rrc ) of h- and he - like ions do vary , apparently in response to the continuum .",
    "we examine those data to constrain the recombination time of the photoionised gas and thereby scale the parameters of the flow in .",
    "was observed by  on 15 orbits between 2009 may 3 and june 15 , yielding an overall exposure of @xmath0600 ks for each of the reflection grating spectrometers , rgs 1 and rgs 2 ( den herder  2001 ) .",
    "full details on the timing , flux levels and x - ray light curves for each satellite orbit of the 2009 observation are included in an accompanying paper on the ` rapid x - ray variability of ' ( vaughan  2011 ) .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the combined and fluxed rgs spectrum summed over the three lowest - flux orbits ( 4,11,13 in figure 2 ) of the 2009 observation .",
    "the emission spectrum is better defined than in any earlier observation of , benefiting from the long exposures and relatively low background prevailing over the relevant part of each orbit .    among the more prominent features are narrow emission lines identified with forbidden transitions in the he - like ions of neix ( rest wavelength 13.698  ) , ovii ( 22.101  ) and nvi ( 29.534  ) . in paper",
    "i it was suggested that the narrow width and very low velocity of the strong ovii forbidden line might indicate an origin in an accumulation of interstellar gas swept up by multiple forward shocks .",
    "in contrast , it was proposed there that the broad emission components , most obvious in figure 1 for oviii lyman-@xmath2 ( 18.968  ) and the region of the ovii triplet ( @xmath021.622.1  ) , but also visible in emission lines of neix , fexvii , nvii , nvi and cvi , might arise in a limb - brightened shell of the cooling post - shock flow .",
    "we explore that concept further in the present paper .        also evident in figure 1",
    "is absorption at the core of several broad emission lines .",
    "it is well known that absorption in a low velocity flow might be underestimated due to ` filling in ' by re - emission from an extended volume of the same ionised gas .",
    "pounds  ( 2004 ) suggested this was so for the narrow , low velocity absorption lines dominating the 2001  observation of .",
    "the higher quality data from the 2009 observations now suggest the interaction of emission and absorption is more complex .    in the remainder of this paper",
    "we explore some general parameters of the broad line soft x - ray emission in  by examining the velocity profiles of oviii lyman-@xmath2 and the ovii triplet ( we outline the method of producing the velocity profiles in the appendix ) .",
    "we then seek to constrain changes in the ionisation state , and hence estimate the particle density in the post - shock flow , by a study of the oviii lyman-@xmath2 velocity profile and of several strong rrc , as the mean continuum flux level changes .",
    "as noted above , the broad emission features are best seen in the low flux data , due to a higher contrast with the continuum , and minimal confusion of low velocity continuum absorption with the self - absorption in the broad lines .",
    "we begin by examining the composite velocity profile of the oviii lyman-@xmath2 line for the 3 lowest flux observations ( obs 4,11,13 ; hereafter the low3 data ) .",
    "figure 3 ( top ) shows the resulting velocity profile , where the broad emission has been visually fitted with a positive gaussian of width , velocity offset and amplitude corresponding to that used in paper i to better quantify absorption in the higher flux spectrum .",
    "( although there is some indication that the actual emission profile is more centrally peaked than a single gaussian , as is also found in broad optical and uv lines , we retain the simpler model as a satisfactory template throughout the present analysis ) .",
    "represented in that way , the emission line is blue - shifted , with a centroid velocity v = -750 km s@xmath1 ( where v=0 corresponds to the lyman-@xmath2 source frame wavelength of 18.968  ) , and 1@xmath3 width of 1420 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we note the measured width greatly exceeds the rgs resolution which corresponds , at @xmath019  , to @xmath3@xmath0400 km s@xmath1 ) .    while the single gaussian is a good fit to the red wing and at the extreme part of the blue wing of the low3 data , strong absorption is evident at a similar velocity to the peak of the emission line .",
    "it is important to note that the broad line emission is stronger than the continuum for these lowflux data , with absorption being confined to low velocities .",
    "allowance for the intrinsic rgs resolution confirms that the red wing emission is real , while the absorption appears entirely to the blue side of zero velocity , a strong indication of self - absorption in the emitting gas . with that interpretation",
    "the profile potentially contains important information on the structure and flow geometry of the broad line gas , a point we take up in section 4 .",
    "the mid panel of figure 3 adds the same template emission gaussian to the composite profile for obs 9 - 15 ( hereafter the low7 data ) , in the second half of the observation and all of relatively low flux .",
    "again the fit to the red wing of the emission line is good , with the improved statistics sharpening the onset of absorption on the blue side of zero velocity .",
    "continuum absorption is now seen near -5000 and -3500 km s@xmath1 , identified as separate high velocity outflow components in paper i.    the lower panel of figure 3 shows the composite oviii lyman-@xmath2 velocity profile for all 15 data sets of the 2009 observation .",
    "the strong high velocity outflow reported in paper i is now seen in the absorption trough extending from @xmath030007000 km s@xmath1 , while a low velocity continuum absorption component is apparent underlying the broad emission line .",
    "more directly relevant to the present study is the excellent visual fit of the lowflux emission template to the all - data broad emission line , again to the red wing and peak , and now also to the blue wing , supporting the working assumption in paper i that the broad emission lines are quasi - constant throughout the 2009 observation .    in summary , we find the broad emission component of the oviii lyman-@xmath2 line to be well described by a positive gaussian of width 1@xmath3 @xmath01420 km s@xmath1 and centred at -750 km s@xmath1 , with strong absorption confined to the blue wing of the emission line .",

    "( lower ) velocity profile for the complete 15 orbit observation .",
    "the positive gaussian obtained from fitting the lowflux spectrum in paper i ( and used in quantifying the highflux absorption ) is seen to match the broad emission line in all 3 composite velocity profiles , supporting the assumption in paper i of a quasi - constant emission arising from an extended region of ionised gas , title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   line .",

    "a similarly broad line was reported by ogle  ( 2004 ) and steenbrugge  ( 2009 ) and interpreted there as arising from an extreme high velocity component of the blr .",
    "we check later whether the improved quality of the new  data allows resolution of the broad emission into individual triplet components , as might be expected , adopting individual component profiles as for oviii lyman-@xmath2 .",
    "however , as a first step , we model the overall emission of the ovii triplet with a single broad component , together with a narrow forbidden line .",
    "figure 4 ( top panel ) shows the ovii low3 velocity profile with the origin set at zero velocity for the intercombination line ( rest wavelength 21.807 ) , close to the centre of the triplet .",
    "the forbidden line is found to be unresolved , with 1@xmath3 width of 364@xmath437 km s@xmath1 ( rgs1 1@xmath3 width @xmath0350 km s@xmath1 at 22 ) , and is blue - shifted by 180@xmath437 km s@xmath1 . the broad emission component is strongly required , with @xmath5@xmath6 falling from 146/86 dof ( for the continuum plus 3 narrow triplet lines ) to 120/87 , with a 1@xmath3 width of 3400@xmath4400 km s@xmath1 , centroid velocity of -70@xmath4450 km s@xmath1 and amplitude 1.6@xmath4@xmath7 counts s@xmath1 bin@xmath1 .",
    "we note that excess counts in the red wing of the forbidden line suggest the fit might be affected by ignoring residual absorption in the ovi line ( rest wavelength 22.019 ) , found to be strong in paper i.    the mid panel of figure 4 shows a further fit , with the addition of narrow resonance and intercombination line emission , and a negative gaussian to allow for the ovi absorption .",
    "the outcome is a further improved fit ( @xmath5@xmath6/dof=96/81 ) , with the broad line width increasing to 4400@xmath4730 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the amplitude of the broad line is only marginally reduced by the inclusion of the narrow emission components , both of which appear to be affected by absorption , the intercombination line probably by the ovi satellite line ( 21.79  ) and the resonance line by self - absorption .",
    "the result is that both lines appear red shifted , in marked contrast to the forbidden line .",
    "the resonance line is most strongly affected , with the observed emission centroid at an unlikely redshift of 470@xmath4140 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we return to this in section 2.3 .            on the basis of the above profile fitting , we find the ovii broad emission line is remarkably strong , the flux within the single broad line fit being more than twice that in the forbidden line .",
    "however , the likelihood remains that the broad emission is a blend from all 3 components of the triplet , assuming the origin is indeed velocity broadening .",
    "it would then be particularly interesting to resolve the separate components as their respective strengths could be an important diagnostic of the density and mode of excitation of the emitting gas .",
    "to seek such a resolved profile we repeated the fit to the low flux data , replacing the single broad component with 3 separate components , each with a blue shift and width of -750 km s@xmath1 and 1420 km s@xmath1 , the template from the fit to oviii lyman-@xmath2 .",
    "the amplitude of each line was left free .",
    "a further negative gaussian was added to allow for absorption in the ovii resonance line .",
    "the main result of this further fit ( figure 4 , lower panel ) was to quantify broad components of the separate triplet lines , finding respective amplitudes of 2.2@xmath4@xmath8 for the forbidden line , and 1.0@xmath4@xmath9 counts s@xmath1 bin@xmath1 for the resonance and intercombination lines .",
    "the narrow forbidden line velocity was unchanged and again unresolved , with a 1@xmath3 width of 310@xmath450 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the absorption lines of ovi and ovii yielded low outflow velocities consistent with the values obtained in paper i.    although this more complex fit was statistically no better than the mid - panel fit , it did confirm the broad emission in ovii to be physically compatible with that seen in oviii lyman-@xmath2 ; moreover , finding the strongest broad component from the forbidden line would rule out a high density for the emitting gas ( and perhaps argue against the blr origin proposed elsewhere ) .",
    "the diagnostic power of the he - like triplets in  and other type 1 agn has often been severely limited by strong absorption of the resonance line , a situation we again find in the 2009  data .",
    "in particular , a dominant forbidden line can not be taken as definitive evidence of a pure photoionised gas ( porquet and dubau 2000 ) .",
    "the observation of a weak and redshifted line in ovii suggests that the resonance line emission may be substantially underestimated in , raising the possibility that the soft x - ray emission has a significant thermal component , which would be consistent with strong two - body cooling in the later stages of the post - shock flow .",
    "we also note that higher temperature ( broader ) rrc s would not be easy to resolve from the continuum , even in spectra of the present quality .",
    "while it is difficult to constrain the core ovii resonance emission in , the nvi triplet appears less strongly self - absorbed in the lowflux data ( figure 5 , top panel ) .",
    "the velocity profile for nvi , again centred on the intercombination line ( 29.082  ) , shows an unresolved forbidden line ( 1@xmath3 width of 330@xmath450 km s@xmath1 ) with a blue - shifted velocity of v = -140@xmath450 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the narrow intercombination line is weaker , but the red wing of the resonance line is much better defined than for ovii .    in order to estimate the true strength of the resonance emission line",
    ", we repeated the nvi profile fit , including resonance and absorption lines initially fixed at velocities ( relative to the source frame ) of -180 km s@xmath1 and -400 km s@xmath1 , respectively , taken from the measured positions of the nvi forbidden and cvii lyman-@xmath10 lines in the same plot .",
    "the outcome was a fit to the resulting p cygni profile of the nvi resonance line ( figure 5 , lower panel ) , with emission and absorption components of similar strength .",
    "in particular , the resonance emission amplitude , 2.4@xmath4@xmath11 counts s@xmath1 bin@xmath1 , was now comparable to the forbidden line , and inconsistent with a pure photoionised gas . while photo - excitation will increase the relative strength of the resonance line ( and has been shown to provide a good fit to the soft x - ray spectra of ngc 1068 , kinkhabwala 2002 ) , a strong resonance line could indicate a significant thermal emission component in .    .",
    "the lower panel includes a pcygni fit to the nvi resonance line , title=\"fig:\",width=238 ] .",
    "the lower panel includes a pcygni fit to the nvi resonance line , title=\"fig:\",width=238 ]",
    "the continuum absorption was found in paper i to have a well determined velocity and ionisation structure . in terms of a cooling post - shock flow ,",
    "the observed correlation of velocity and ionisation parameter requires the recombination time to be sufficiently short for the gas to adjust along the flow . to check for that consistency requires the flow dimensions to be known , which in turn depends on breaking the degeneracy between radial distance ( from the ionising source ) and the particle density at some point along the flow .",
    "establishing a flux - linked variability in the ionisation structure of the flow , and hence the related recombination rate and gas density , is also of key importance in estimating the mass , energy and momentum of the outflow . to pursue those aims",
    "we have examined the velocity profiles for each individual orbit of the 2009 observation .",
    "we focus here on profiles from observations of relatively low mean flux ( and thereby less affected by absorption ) , and immediately following the highest - flux observation ( obs 8 in figure 2 ) .",
    "we again show the profile centred on oviii lyman-@xmath2 , which also covers the region of the nvii rrc .",
    "line for 3 successive orbits following several days of high continuum flux .",
    "a strong and possibly blue shifted nvii rrc is seen to fade over several days , title=\"fig:\",width=234 ]   line for 3 successive orbits following several days of high continuum flux .",
    "a strong and possibly blue shifted nvii rrc is seen to fade over several days , title=\"fig:\",width=228 ]   line for 3 successive orbits following several days of high continuum flux .",
    "a strong and possibly blue shifted nvii rrc is seen to fade over several days , title=\"fig:\",width=234 ]    figure 6 reproduces the profiles for obs 9,10 and 11 . in each case",
    "the lowflux gaussian template represents a satisfactory visual fit to the red ( unabsorbed ) wing of the broad emission line . to the blue side ,",
    "only obs 11 ( lower panel ) is a good fit , with absorption more strongly affecting the higher flux profiles . nevertheless , to first order the broad line emission is essentially unchanged over the 3 successive orbits .",
    "however , the obs 9 profile shows a strong excess to the blue side of v = -6000 km s@xmath1 ( corresponding to the threshold wavelength of the nvii rrc ) . in obs 10 ,",
    "some 2 days later , the rrc is noticeably weaker , while in a further 4 days , by obs 11 , it has faded from view .",
    "although the rrc profile is not well determined , and might be affected by ovii absorption , an apparent blue shift of @xmath02000 km s@xmath1 in the peak flux is of particular interest , in suggesting an origin in the intermediate velocity outflow seen in absorption ( paper i ) . importantly , if confirmed , that identification would link the intermediate velocity gas with a region in the flow where fully stripped nitrogen is recombining over several days as the x - ray flux falls back from its peak in obs 8 .",
    "a recombination timescale of @xmath02 - 6 days for the relevant component in the outflow would then correspond to a particle density @xmath0@xmath12@xmath13 .",
    "the potential importance of a variable nvii rrc , apparently responding to an earlier peak continuum flux , increases the interest in examining other rrc covered by the rgs data .",
    "the ovii rrc ( threshold wavelength 16.769  ) is found to be strong , and apparently variable , but its measurement is impeded by strong nearby fexvii lines , and by a location at the long wavelength edge of the fe uta",
    ". the oviii and neix rrc fall in regions where the rgs sensitivity is falling .",
    "however , both cv and cvi are found to exhibit strong rrc , and are less affected by other spectral features .",
    "the top two panels of figure 7 show velocity profiles for the cvi rrc , centred at the threshold wavelength of 25.303   ( note the binning here is 600 km s@xmath1 , with an extended range to the blue side to cover the region of the nvii lyman-@xmath2 line at 24.781    and to better determine the continuum level ) .",
    "an emission line template is added visually to the top panel and carried over to the higher flux level profile in the middle panel , the primary aim here being to show that the cvi rrc is well resolved .",
    "as with the nvii rrc , the peak cvi rrc flux is seen to shift to the blue as the continuum level increases , and in this case there are no likely absorption lines to affect the rrc profile close to the threshold wavelength .",
    "the similarity in the cvi and nvii rrc blue shifts at higher continuum levels strengthens a direct association of the recombining plasma with the strong intermediate velocity absorption ( @xmath03500 - 5000 km s@xmath1 ) observed in the same higher level ions ( paper i ) .",
    "furthermore , tracking the cvi rrc through individual orbits shows a similar pattern to the nvii rrc , again indicating a response time for the intermediate velocity gas of a few days .",
    "in contrast , the lower level cv rrc ( 31.63  ) shown in figure 7 ( lower panel ) only appears at the zero velocity threshold , consistent with the low absorption velocities characteristic for that ion .    in summary , we find rrc of nvii and cvi to vary in strength and velocity profile over several days and in a manner apparently dependent on the continuum flux level .",
    "we interpret the variability as from enhanced photoionisation of the high velocity flow when the continuum flux level is high , being followed by strong recombination over the following days of reduced flux level .",
    "the velocity and ionisation gradients found in the absorption spectra ( paper i ) then explain the differences between the rrc of nvii , cvi and the lower ionisation state of cv .",
    "the best determined rrc profiles all indicate a relatively low temperature of @xmath07@xmath42 ev .",
    "line clarifying the resolution of the rrc .",
    "the peak rrc flux is seen to shift to the blue for higher continuum levels , as also found for the nvii rrc .",

    "in paper i we reported a rich absorption line spectrum from the 2009  observation of , revealing the presence of an ionised outflow with a wide range of velocities and ionisation parameter .",
    "the absorption line velocity structure and a broad correlation of velocity with ionisation parameter were shown there to be consistent with an outflow scenario where a highly ionised , high velocity wind runs into the interstellar medium or previous ejecta , losing much of its kinetic energy in the resultant strong shock ( king 2010 ) . with the strong immediate post - shock cooling likely to be dominated by compton scattering of the agn thermal continuum ( king 2003 ) , we also noted that a quasi - constant soft x - ray emission component might be evidence of further energy loss as the post - shock gas slowed and recombined ahead of the contact discontinuity .",
    "a second outstanding feature of the soft x - ray data from the 2009 observation was a complex emission line spectrum , particularly evident at low continuum flux levels , with velocity - broadened emission from several h- and he - like resonance lines , as well as a number of strong rrc .",
    "broad emission lines of ovii and oviii have been reported previously from  ( ogle 2004 , steenbrugge 2009 ) , and attributed to scattering of the agn x - ray continuum from high velocity clouds in the blr .",
    "an alternative interpretation , outlined here , envisages the broad emission lines arising from the limb - brightened shell of shocked gas building up ahead of the contact discontinuity . on this alternative picture",
    "the line broadening primarily arises from the angular divergence of the flow at the bright limb of the expanding spherical shell .",
    "an optically thin spherical shell would produce an emission line centered on zero velocity ( in the agn rest frame ) . since in a spherical geometry",
    "the absorbing gas will always have a positive line - of - sight velocity relative to the emission , self absorption in the shell will set the onset of absorption at zero velocity .",
    "the latter is precisely what the data ( eg figure 3 ) show , although the peak of emission is shifted to the blue .",
    "figure 8 sketches the geometry of such a limb - brightened shell , where the broad emission line of oviii lyman-@xmath2 is depicted arising from a near - orthogonal component of the high velocity radial flow , seen in absorption in line of sight to the continuum , but now with lower apparent velocities observed in emission from the limb . in the figure , for a typical post - shock absorption velocity of 5000 km s @xmath1 ( paper i ) the red and blue wings ( at hwhm ) of the oviii lyman-@xmath2 line correspond to rear and forward inclinations a@xmath012@xmath14 and b@xmath030@xmath14 , respectively .    while the blue offset in the observed broad emission line profiles might be an artefact of the self absorption , it is perhaps more likely evidence of a dominantly near - sided / approaching outflow .",
    "however , we also note the red wing in the oviii lyman-@xmath2 line is broader than the instrument response , indicating that at least part of the far , receding side of the shell is visible .",
    "the putative torus is an obvious candidate for obscuring part of the receding flow in the shell , given the estimated shell radius of @xmath0@xmath15 cm ( paper i ) . in that context",
    "it is interesting to note that a strong blue - shifted asymmetry in the [ oiii ] line profile of  was described by veilleux ( 1991 ) to ` favour radial motion and a source of obscuration ' . on still larger scales , a narrower ,",
    "forward projected conical outflow was observed in [ oiii ] imaging and spectroscopy of  ( christopoulou  1997 ) .",
    "is explained as emission from the high velocity radial flow , seen in continuum absorption when in line of sight to the nucleus .",
    "the indicated flow lines correspond to the red ( u ) and blue ( v ) wings of the emission line profile when viewed by the observer .",
    "the central offset corresponds to a dominantly near - sided / approaching outflow , width=245 ]    with the flow of gas in the limb brightened shell near - orthogonal to the line of sight , the geometry of figure 8 also offers a natural explanation of the separate low velocity absorption component , found in paper i to occur over a wide range of ionisation , in contrast to the higher velocity absorption where the velocity and ionisation parameter are strongly correlated .",
    "in contrast to the quasi - constant broad emission lines , the rrc of nvii and cvi are found to vary , in both strength and profile , on a timescale of days .",
    "given that the change appears to respond to the continuum flux level , we interpret the variability in terms of the recombination time and hence derive a particle density for the relevant intermediate velocity / ionisation region in the post - shock flow of order @xmath16 @xmath13 .",
    "the relatively short recombination time provides an important consistency check on the observed velocity / ionisation gradient in the absorption spectra reported in paper i , and shown there to be a simple consequence of mass conservation .",
    "in particular , that outcome requires the flow to recombine sufficiently quickly as it decelerates , in order to maintain the observed velocity / ionisation correlation . with an estimated shell thickness ( paper i ) of @xmath0@xmath17 cm , and for a mean velocity of @xmath04000 km s@xmath1 , the shell transit time of a few months is comfortably longer than the recombination time along the flow .",
    "we also note that the relatively low density in the post - shock gas is consistent with finding a broad component to the ovii forbidden line .    finally ,",
    "while the strong rrc are indicative of a photoionised gas , as is the low temperature kt@xmath07ev , we also find a narrow resonance emission line in the nvi triplet comparable in strength to the narrow forbidden line , which could imply an electron temperature an order of magnitude higher ( fig . 7 in porquet and dubau , 2000 ) and indicate significant thermal emission .",
    "however , some of the clearest soft x - ray emission spectra to date , from observations of the bright seyfert 2 galaxies , mkn 3 ( sako  2000 ) and ngc 1068 ( kinkhabwala  2002 , ogle  2003 ) , have shown that the x - ray emission in those objects is explained by radiative recombination and decay in an outflow which is photoionised and photoexcited by the central continuum , with no significant thermal emission .",
    "nevertheless , the obscuring torus in such a type 2 object is likely to hide emission from the innermost , high velocity flow . in that respect",
    "it is interesting to recall that  epic spectra of a sample of 2mass sources suggested the ` hidden ' soft x - ray emission could be relatively strong ( pounds and wilkes 2007 , wilkes  2008 ) , while we also note that the high quality soft x - ray spectra of type 2 seyferts show no evidence for broad line emission .    in that wider context ,",
    "the 2009  observation of  may offer one of the best opportunities to date to study the full soft x - ray emission spectrum of a seyfert galaxy . on our interpretation , at least , the inner regions are of special interest in harbouring shocks that are likely to strongly affect the dynamics of the subsequent outflow and its interaction with the host galaxy .",
    "broad emission lines of oviii lyman-@xmath2 and the ovii triplet , possibly including a broad component of the forbidden line , are found to be strong throughout the 2009  observation of .",
    "the low centroid velocity of the oviii lyman-@xmath2 broad line is consistent with an origin in the limb - brightened shell of post - shock gas , with emission from the near - orthogonal component of the flow seen in continuum absorption at @xmath05000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the same limb - brightened geometry provides a natural explanation for the sharp onset of absorption to the blue side of zero velocity , found in all individual velocity profiles , being interpreted as a consequence of the radial flow through the limb - brightened shell leading all absorbing gas to have a blue shift relative to the source of emission .",
    "the detection of rrc of nvii and cvi which vary in both flux and velocity profile , as the continuum level changes , has yielded an important measure of the recombination timescale for ionised gas in the related high velocity flow . breaking the degeneracy between radius and particle density , that so often limits the assessment of agn outflows , has allowed the radius and thickness of the shell of post - shock gas to be estimated , and in turn has confirmed that the high velocity flow is able to recombine sufficiently fast to maintain the observed correlation of ionisation parameter and velocity reported in paper i.    strong low velocity absorption renders the ovii resonance line essentially unconstrained , and leads to narrow components of oviii lyman-@xmath2 and other resonance lines in  ( and perhaps more generally in type i seyferts ) to be poorly determined .",
    "together with the observational difficulty of detecting much broader ( and hotter ) rrc , we conclude that a significant thermal contribution to the soft x - ray emission of , can not be ruled out .",
    "nevertheless , with the relatively low particle densities in the post - shock flow , two - body cooling is likely to remain less important than compton cooling which we have argued ( paper i , king 2003 ) will be strong so close to the agn continuum .",
    "the results reported here are based on observations obtained with , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
    "the authors wish to thank andrew king and mike goad for useful discussions , the referee for a careful reading of the manuscript , and the soc and ssc teams for organising the  observations and initial data reduction .",

    "in this section we describe the method used to produce the line velocity profiles which are the basis of the analysis in this paper .",
    "we choose the velocity plots as they provide a convenient ( and accurate ) way of combining different data sets , and present the parameters of interest in the directly relevant velocity coordinates .",
    "each rgs observation was first processed using rgsproc to produce a set of first - order source and background spectra , along with appropriate response matrices , from each of rgs1 and rgs2 , with @xmath18 wavelength channels .",
    "the simplest way to produce a velocity profile for several lines from several observations is to sum the counts in each spectral channel across the observations , transform the wavelengths of the channels around each line of interest to velocity shifts relative to the ( source - frame ) wavelength of the line , and then average ( or sum ) over the different lines .",
    "unfortunately this simple procedure is complicated by three facts about the rgs data .",
    "firstly , the rgs effective area can change sharply due to bad pixels , columns or even whole ccds .",
    "secondly , small differences in pointing between the observations mean that the wavelength - channel conversion differs slightly between observations .",
    "( at least , this is true for the standard products produced by rgsproc ) . and thirdly",
    ", the wavelength resolution of the rgs is approximately constant across the spectral range , meaning that the velocity resolution differs for lines at different wavelengths .",
    "taken together the first two facts mean that co - adding spectra by summing the counts in each channel will result in a degradation ( blurring ) of the line response function , and may produce spurious line - like features ( due to narrow `` drop outs '' in the spectra ) if not corrected using an effective area curve computed for the merged data .",
    "the third point means that the velocity bins for one line will not be well matched to those of other lines , making it difficult to average the counts in velocity bins over different lines .",
    "the solution we employ is to convert each spectrum from counts per channel , with a corresponding channel to wavelength range conversion , to a list of wavelengths for each event .",
    "we do this by randomising the wavelength of each event in a given spectral channel , in a given observation , within the wavelength range of the channel specified in the appropriate ( observation - specific ) response matrix .",
    "this effectively ` unbins ' the spectrum , but as the wavelength range of each channel ( in the @xmath18 channel rgs spectral products ) is far smaller than the resolving power of the rgs , the randomisation within a given channel leads to negligible degradation of the spectral resolution .",
    "the wavelengths of the counts around specific lines of interest can be converted to velocity shifts ( after corrected for the source s systemic redshift ) , and the counts rebinned into velocity bins of width @xmath19 .",
    "the counts per velocity bin are then summed over different observations and different lines to produce a composite line profile in velocity space .",
    "error bars are computed assuming simple counting statistics ( i.e poissonian fluctuations within each velocity bin ) .",
    "the same procedure is applied to the background spectra to produce a composite background spectrum in velocity space .",
    "the complex changes in effective area as a function of wavelength mean that the relative weighting of source and background spectra is itself a complex function of wavelength .",
    "the effective exposure time per velocity bin of the composite was calculated by summing the product of the individual exposure times of the observations and a wavelength - dependent quality function to account for ` drop outs ' in individual spectra ( caused by bad ccd columns or missing chips , which contributed zero effective exposure for certain wavelengths ) .",
    "this was converted to velocity space ( around the lines of interest ) , averaged in velocity bins , summed over the different lines .",
    "the result is the average exposure time each velocity bin acquired from each observation and each line contributing to the spectrum .",
    "this was then used to calculate the effective count rate ( ct s@xmath1 ) per velocity bin for both source and background spectra .",
    "the wavelength - dependent scaling of source and background extraction regions was calculated by summing the effective area curves ( as a function of wavelength ) of each observation , weighted by the observational exposure time , separately for the source and background data .",
    "the ratio of the resulting curves gives the source / background scaling as a function of wavelength .",
    "this scaling function was then converted to velocity shifts ( around the lines of interest ) , averaged in velocity bins , summed over the different lines , and the result used to perform the velocity - dependent background subtraction .",
    "the final result is a background - corrected count rate as a function of velocity ."
