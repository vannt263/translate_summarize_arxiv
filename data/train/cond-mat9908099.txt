    "as a result of literally hundreds of experiments , the dephasing time @xmath1 has been measured in all dimensions . the earlier progress in this field was summarized in reviews @xcite ; more recent results can be found in refs .",

    "the dephasing attracted renewed interest due to rapid development of the quantum information processing ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite addressed the old problem of the low - temperature saturation of @xmath2 , which is observed in essentially all experiments at @xmath3 . on the basis of detailed measurements of @xmath2 in one - dimensional ( @xmath4 ) gold wires",
    ", they came to the conclusion that a finite dephasing rate at @xmath5 is intrinsic , and is related to the zero - point fluctuations of the electrons .",
    "this issue is important since an intrinsic saturation of @xmath2 would signal a breakdown of fermi - liquid behavior of low - dimensional conductors in the metallic regime .",
    "this mini - review does not pretend to cover all recent measurements of @xmath1 .",
    "instead , i focus on several problems , which are common for the low - temperature dephasing experiments , and which are relevant to the quest for extra - large @xmath2 .",
    "one problem is fundamental : when @xmath2 becomes of the order of the diffusion time over the localization length @xmath6 , the low - dimensional conductors enter the strong localization ( sl ) regime . in this regime ,",
    "the hopping rate replaces the dephasing rate .",
    "two other experimental problems are the noise - induced dephasing and overheating of electrons by applied voltage and/or external noise .",
    "recent measurements of the electron - phonon scattering rate in disordered conductors help to clarify the latter problem .",
    "the dephasing time is usually extracted from the low - field magnetoresistance @xcite and , less often , from the temperature dependence of the universal conductance fluctuations @xcite .",
    "measurements of @xmath1 in a variety of 1d , 2d , and 3d metal and semiconductor stuctures have been reported ( see @xcite and references therein ) . at present , there is experimental evidence of several  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  sources of dephasing .",
    "the most important intrinsic mechanisms are :    - the electron - phonon interaction , which governs dephasing at high temperatures ;    -the electron - electron interaction , which dominates at low temperatures ( typically , below 1 - 10k for 1d and 2d conductors ) .",
    "the most common  extrinsic  sources of dephasing are magnetic impurities and the high - frequency electromagnetic noise in the experimental set - up .",
    "i will focus on the low-@xmath7 regime in 1d and 2d conductors , typical experimental data are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the observed dependence @xmath8 can be accounted for by the theory of electron - electron interaction in disordered metals @xcite .",
    "the theory predicts that in low dimensions , interactions with small momentum and energy transfers are the most efficient dephasing mechanism . these quasielastic electron - electron collisions are equivalent to interaction of an electron with the fluctuating electromagnetic field produced by all the other electrons ( dephasing by the equilibrium nyquist noise ) .",
    "the nyquist dephasing rate can be expressed as @xcite :    @xmath9    @xmath10     for au wires ( @xmath11 - the width @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ; @xmath15 - @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) @xcite , and for the si @xmath19-doped gaas wire ( @xmath20 - @xmath21 , the carrier concentration @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ) @xcite .",

    "absolute values of @xmath2 for metal wires are usually somehow smaller than the estimates ( [ 1dee ] ) and ( [ 2dee ] ) from the 1d magnetoresistance , one should use the expression for the 1d wl correction calculated for the quasi - elastic dephasing in ref .",

    "these calculations are in good agreement with direct measurements of @xmath92 in thin metal films @xcite ( see also fig.5b ) .",
    "rapid growth of @xmath91 with decreasing temperature causes a very large thermal resistance between the electrons and the phonons .",

    "even smaller values of @xmath93 are sufficient for overheating the 2d electrons in gaas structures ( fig .",
    "4b ) . for this reason , a very thorough filtering of all the leads to the sample is required .    since both localization and interaction corrections at low @xmath7 depend on the electron temperature only , it is easy to check if the electrons are at the bath temperature : the electron overheating also causes saturation of @xmath27 .",

    "the dephasing time plotted for this sample versus the bath temperature @xmath7 demonstrates a clear saturation below @xmath96 ( fig 3 ) ; this saturation is less pronounced if one takes into account the electron overheating .      the authors of ref.@xcite have demonstrated that saturation of @xmath2 , observed for 1d au wires , was not caused by electron overheating or by the spin - spin scattering . in a limited temperature range @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is non - universal , since the density of the non - magnetic dynamic tls with an almost degenerate kondo ground state is both sample- and history - dependent . ]",
    "it is more difficult , however , to rule out another possibility for the @xmath8 saturation , namely , dephasing by external noise .",
    "indeed , it has been known since the early 80s , that the external high - frequency radiation can induce dephasing @xcite ; this effect was observed in the experiments @xcite .",
    "the key point is that dephasing by the rf noise can occur _ without _ electron overheating .",

    "the inflow of the noise energy is balanced by the energy outflow due to two competing cooling mechanisms , the epi and outdiffusion of hot electrons in cooler leads .",
    "the latter mechanism becomes more efficient in relatively short samples at low temperatures @xcite . as it is shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , balancing of the incoming rf noise energy ( sufficiently strong for dephasing ) by the hot - electron outdiffusion results in a negligible rise of the electron temperature if the total resistance of a wire is less than the quantum resistance @xmath102 . in the experiment @xcite , the wire resistance was in the range @xmath103 , and one can not exclude the possibility of rf - noise - induced dephasing without electron overheating ( see fig .",

    "@xcite ; here we briefly compare the predictions of the theory @xcite with the experiment .",
    "according to ref.@xcite , the dephasing rate in 3d conductors is limited by @xmath128 , which is comparable with the elastic scattering time @xmath129 .",

    "this disagreement is equally strong for both macroscopically homogemeous and inhomogeneous systems ( thus , it can not be attributed to the charging effects @xcite ) , with the parameter @xmath131 ( this rules out the argument that the theory @xcite disagrees only with the data for systems with @xmath132 ) .",

    "@xmath133 would preclude observation of the @xmath7-dependent wl corrections .",
    "on the other hand , a well - pronounced temperature dependence of @xmath2 has been observed , and the experimental values of @xmath2 are typically much greater than @xmath36 ( figs .",
    "1b , 3b and 5a ) .",
    "note , that since @xmath134 is always much smaller than the localization length , this would prohibit the 2d wl - sl crossover .",
    "this prediction is also at odds with the experiment @xcite .    in 1d ,",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath135 coincides with the 1d nyquist dephasing rate ( eq.[1dee ] ) at @xmath136 , and saturates at lower temperatures @xcite .",
    "this saturation corresponds to the maximum dephasing length @xmath137 , where @xmath6 is the 1d localization length , @xmath138 is the number of transverse channels in the wire .",

    "intrinsic  , universal mechanism of a finite dephasing rate at @xmath5 .",
    "such evidence could be obtained only if all the known reasons for saturation of @xmath2 were ruled out . in this respect ,",
    "a useful guideline is provided by the law of economy ( also known as ockham s razor ) :  entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity  .",
    "this does not mean , of course , that one can not expect to encounter new phenomena with a further decrease in temperature .",
    "clearly , the experimental and theoretical study of the low - temperature dephasing will remain an important and exciting field in the future .",
    "there are many transverse quantum channels in the conductors that are one - dimensional with respect to the quantum interference effects , and the inter - channel scattering is strong .",
    "the physics of these ( quasi)-1d conductors is essentially different from the physics of quantum wires ; the latter single - channel limit is described by the tomonaga - luttinger model ."
