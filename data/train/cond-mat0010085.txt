    "recently there was remarkable progress in the study of the crossover from weak - coupling ( bcs ) superconductivity to bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of tightly bound fermion pairs .",
    "although this crossover was first addressed a long time ago @xcite-@xcite , the recent interest in this subject @xcite-@xcite was initiated by suggestions of its relevance to high - temperature superconductors @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this crossover is a remarkable example of smooth evolution between two very different physical systems .",
    "a few of its features are : in the bcs superconductors there is one characteristic temperature @xmath1 where superconductivity disappears due to thermal decomposition of cooper pairs .",
    "in contrast , the  bose - type \" superconductor possesses two characteristic temperatures , namely a critical temperature which in the extreme bose regime does not depend on coupling strength and a substantially higher temperature of thermal pair decomposition . also the bcs condensate is characterized by a coherence length which coincides with the size of a cooper pair whereas in the bose limit the system possesses two characteristic length scales , namely a coherence length which increases with increasing coupling strength and a cooper pair size which obviously decreases with increasing coupling strength .    in fact ,",
    "this crossover is related to many other phenomena in various branches of physics .",
    "in particular it was generalized to the chiral gross - neveu ( gn ) model @xcite .",
    "this model is considered as a toy model for qcd .",
    "there are also numerous ongoing discussions of the possibility of the appearance of a pseudogap phase in the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite with @xmath2 serving as a small parameter of the problem .",
    "however in a real world @xmath3 thus as it is not infinite , the system may possess [ e.g. at finite temperature ] a fluctuation - driven restoration of the chiral symmetry while preserving nonzero constituent quark mass .",
    "this would be a phenomenon similar to the symmetry restoration without pairbreaking in strong coupling or low carrier density superconductors .",
    "however in the case of the njl model there are complications that do not allow this problem to be addressed rigorously by perturbative methods @xcite .",

    "in contrast to the particle physics , in the theory of superconductivity the bcs - bec crossover has been studied in great detail . however , the main subject of the study was the evolution of critical temperature and non - fermi  liquid properties above @xmath1 . intuitive clarity of the physical picture of this crossover is obscured by the absence of simple analytical and asymtotic results for many other physical quantities ( e.g. for the behavior of thermodynamic functions ) .",
    "the low - temperature asymptotics of thermodynamic functions of a bcs superconductor are well known and can be found in many textbooks .",

    "we use a mean - field approximation which , in the range of its validity , allows a nice simple description of the crossover .",
    "it is known that in bcs limit the mean - field approximation is valid for the description of the entire superconductive region .",
    "in fact the system crosses over from bcs to bose condensate in a very narrow region @xmath8 ( see e.g. @xcite ) so the bcs approximation is adequate for description of the entire superconductive region in the range @xmath64 .",
    "this is in contrast to bec limit where the superconductive transition is governed by the thermal excitation of collective modes rather than thermal decomposition of individual particles , the effect which is missed in the mean - filed approximation .",
    "so in the bec limit we must be restricted in the following discussion to the temperatures much lower than the temperature of superconductive transition : @xmath65 , where @xmath66^{2/3 } \\pi /m $ ]  [ see e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "a special care should be taken when a mean - field approximation is used for the description of a two - dimensional system .",
    "it is well - known , that a straightforward calculations of the next - to - leading order corrections gives that the gap should be exactly zero at any finite temperature in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "this is due to the fact that , according to standard dimensional reduction arguments , a 2 + 1 -dimensional system is effectively two dimensional at high temperature and in two dimensions there is no goldstone boson as it is articulated in coleman - mermin - wagner - hohenberg theorem @xcite .",
    "however as it was shown by witten @xcite ( see also @xcite ) a direct calculation of corrections misses essential physics of a two - dimensional problem and a mean - field results still have sense under certain conditions in 2d .",
    "the situation is following : the fluctuations can be made arbitrarily weak by decreasing temperature in 2 + 1 dimensions ( or e.g. increasing n in 2d zero temperature calculations in @xcite ) and then employing a  modulus - phase variables \" @xmath67 one can observe that the system possesses a very well - defined ",
    "mexican hat \" effective potential that determines the gap _",
    "modulus_. due to phase fluctuations in the degenerate valley of the potential , the average of the complex gap function is zero , however there exist a gap locally ( i.e. in some sense the system in its low energy domain degenerates to a nonlinear sigma model ) . in 2 + 1 dimensions , as the temperature approaches zero the thermal fluctuations in the degenerate valley of the effective potential gradually vanish and at @xmath47 a local gap becomes a real gap .",
    "existence of the _ local _ gap modulus @xmath17 does not contradict the coleman - mermin - wagner - hohenberg theorem since @xmath17 is neutral under @xmath68 transformations .",
    "thus at low temperature in 2 + 1 dimensions there appears an  almost \" goldstone boson that becomes a real goldstone boson at exactly zero temperature . at low temperatures we can neglect contribution from weak phase fluctuation at temperatures much lower than the temperature of the kosterlitz - thouless transition , which in the weak coupling limit approximately coincides with the temperature of pair formation and in strong - coupling limit reaches a plateau value : @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the fermi energy of free fermions with the carrier density @xmath71 and mass @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "let us now outline how finite temperature quantities will be derived .",
    "we start with inspection of the gap @xmath17 behavior at low temperature .",
    "@xmath72 can be expressed with the help of the analytic zero - temperature results from @xcite .",
    "for example in three dimension we can write an equation that relates the gap at zero temperature with the gap at finite temperature at a fixed crossover parameter @xmath4 ( which enters implicitly @xmath73 ) : @xmath74 this equation should be solved self - consistently with eq .",
    "( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "we must observe that the above system of equations , in contrast to zero - temperature calculations has the temperature as an extra parameter .",
    "thus we need to specify in what model we are studying temperature effects with two most general options being : ( i )  fixed chemical potential model \" - i.e. when we do not fix the carrier density but assume the presence of a reservoir which provides us with a temperature - independent chemical potential @xmath75 or ( ii )  fixed carrier \" density model - i.e. when @xmath71 is fixed and @xmath18 varies with temperature .",
    "we choose the first option since such a fixed-@xmath18 model is the most convenient for deriving asymptotic results for the finite - temperature behavior of the system .",
    "however the choice of the model is not principal since from ( [ 1.2 ] ) it is seen that in a  fixed density \" regime the chemical potential in bcs and bec limits depends very weakly on temperature in comparison with the dependence on the coupling strength in the regimes where our formulas are valid . moreover the temperature dependence of the chemical potential in the entire crossover region was calculated numerically in 2d in @xcite and it is small comparing to its variation with coupling strength in the temperature range @xmath76 .",
    "so the results are similar in both cases of the presence of a particle reservoir that provides temperature independent chemical potential when carrier density varies or in the model of temperature independent carrier density .",
    "in our calculation we use @xmath4 as the most convenient crossover parameter , since it depends via the simple relation @xmath77 on the chemical potential which can be measured rather directly experimentally @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 ranges from @xmath41 in the strong - coupling ( bose - einstein ) limit to @xmath42 in the weak - coupling ( bcs ) limit .",
