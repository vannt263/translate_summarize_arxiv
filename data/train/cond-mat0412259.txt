    "in recent years it became abundantly clear that driven quantum systems exhibit behavior that is qualitatively different from their classical counterparts .",
    "indeed , a driven classically chaotic system exhibits joel s heating .",
    "that is , its average stored energy increases at a steady rate . in other words ,",
    "such behavior may be characterized as a diffusion in the system s phase space .",
    "the remarkable feature of driven _ quantum _ systems is finiteness of their phase space motion ( localization ) .",
    "such dynamical localization phenomena was discussed in context of pumped quantum dots @xcite , bose - einstein condensates subject to pulses of optical standing wave @xcite , optical microcavity @xcite , and other systems .",
    "the simplest model that became a paradigm for studies of the quantum dynamical localization is quantum kicked rotor ( qkr ) .",
    "it was numerical discovery of localization in qkr by casati _",
    "_ @xcite in the late seventies that triggered the broad interest to the subject .",
    "recent progress in trapping of cold atoms and optical manipulation with them lead to experimental realization of the qkr with the unprecedented degree of control @xcite .",

    "the amplitude of the kicks is described by the dimensionless parameter @xmath3 , also known as the classical stochastically parameter .",
    "it is the only parameter of the corresponding classical problem .",
    "the quantum problem possesses another dimensionless parameter : the effective planck constant @xmath4 .",
    "the latter enters the problem through the canonical commutation relation : @xmath5=i{\\mathchar'26\\mkern-9muk}$ ] .",
    "the two parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 are straightforwardly related to the optical wavelength , amplitude and atomic mass in cold atoms experiments @xcite .    historically , the _ classical _ kicked rotor , or standard mapping , first introduced by chirikov , served as the prototype model for various transport processes in plasmas @xcite .",
    "it was established that the classical dynamics of the kicked rotor exhibits complicated behavior .",
    "most notably it demonstrates the transition from the regular to chaotic motion @xcite . in particular , for sufficiently large classical parameter @xmath6 , the chaotic diffusion takes place in the space of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the latter is associated with the unlimited diffusive expansion of an initially narrow momenta distribution : @xmath7 the classical diffusion constant , @xmath8 , was a subject of numerous studies @xcite and is well understood by now @xcite . for large stochastically parameter @xmath9 , one finds @xmath10 , where the omitted corrections posses an oscillatory dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "the pioneering numerical studies of casati _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite revealed that the corresponding _ quantum _ system , @xmath11 , behaves in a dramatically different way .",
    "the initial diffusive expansion ( that is heating ) saturates after a certain time , @xmath12 , and the momentum distribution width stabilizes at @xmath13 .",
    "it was soon suggested in ref .",
    "that similarly to anderson localization , quantum phase interference may lead to the suppression of classical diffusion for long enough time .",
    "this heuristic idea was complemented by mapping qkr onto a one - dimensional tight - binding anderson model with the pseudo  random potential @xcite .",
    "such interpretation leads to the estimate of the localization length as @xmath14 and thus @xmath15 .",
    "the similarity was further confirmed by studies of a perturbation that breaks the `` time - reversal symmetry '' ( trs ) of the qkr @xcite .",
    "such perturbation suppresses the survival probability by a factor of two .",
    "that is closely analogous to the doubling of the anderson localization length by the static magnetic field , destroying the interference between a trajectory and its time - reversal partner @xcite .    if the momentum localization length , @xmath16 , is much longer than the `` microscopic '' scale of the angular momentum ( that is @xmath4 ) then @xmath17 and thus @xmath18 . in this case",
    "there is a parametrically long crossover regime from the classical diffusion : @xmath19 for @xmath20 to the strong localization : @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "one may be able to develop a systematic perturbation theory in powers of @xmath23 , analogous to the weak  localization loop expansion in the anderson localization theory @xcite .",
    "such task was undertaken by altland @xcite , who found for the one  loop correction : @xmath24 .",
    "it was suggested furthermore that the universal long - time behavior of the qkr is described by the diffusive supersymmetric nonlinear @xmath25-model @xcite similar to those employed in the localization theory @xcite .",
    "those calculations essentially map the qkr on a quantum particle in the field of a _ white  noise _ random potential .",
    "while such analogy is reasonable at long time scales @xmath26 , it fails to recognize details of the classical to quantum crossover at intermediate time scales .",
    "indeed , a quantized classically chaotic system requires a certain time scale , called the ehrenfest time , @xmath27 , to develop quantum interference effects .",
    "this fact was realized independently in various contexts @xcite and now days is well documented in the literature @xcite . the physics behind this fact is as follows .",
    "to experience the quantum interference , two classical trajectories must converge to a region of the phase space of the size @xmath28 .",
    "convergence ( and divergence ) of trajectories in a classically chaotic system is governed by the lyapunov instability exponent @xmath29 as e.g. @xmath30 .",
    "it thus takes time @xmath31 before the interference effects can reveal themselves .    as we show below , for @xmath32 the quantitative definition of the ehrenfest time for the qkr",
    "is given by @xmath33 while the classical lyapunov exponent is @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "therefore there is the parametric regime @xmath35 , or more precisely : @xmath36 where exists a wide separation of the relevant time scales : @xmath37 one may expect that such regime is amenable for an _ analytical _ treatment of the classical  to  quantum crossover .",
    "this problem was first tackled by aleiner and larkin @xcite in the context of random classical ( long - range ) potential scattering ( e.g. , random lorentz gases ) . however , due to the complexity of the lorentz gas classical dynamics , their treatment required a regularization .",
    "the latter is essentially a weak quantum scattering potential added to the lorentz gas .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop a systematic first ",
    "principle analytic treatment of the qkr . in particular , we are able to incorporate the semiclassical dynamics at the scale of @xmath27 into the weak dynamical localization theory without introducing any regularization .",
    "the qkr allows thus to demonstrate explicitly an essential point : _ existence of the dynamical localization is an intrinsic property of quantized classically chaotic systems  not an artefact of an extraneous regularization_. ( remarkably , the ehrenfest time does _ not _ dependend on the regularizer strength @xcite . )",
    "this observation is fully consistent with the early studies of ehrenfest time @xcite , suggested the existence of such time scale . for the time interval @xmath38 ,",
    "our approach fully encompasses the ehrenfest regime .",
    "the results were reported in the short letter @xcite . the main result for the time ",

    "( ii ) eq .  ( [ resultapp ] ) describes quantum correction _ linear _ in @xmath4 that appears to be delayed by @xmath43 .",
    "as first noticed by shepelansky @xcite , _ quadratic _ in @xmath4 corrections show up even at earlier time .",
    "however , for at least three first kicks , they may be fully absorbed into a renormalization of the diffusion constant @xcite ( @xmath46 , essentially due to the change in the scattering cross  section ) .",
    "it is thus an oversimplification to claim the absence of quantum effects at @xmath47 .",
    "( iii ) eq .",
    "( [ resultapp ] ) constitutes the one  loop weak  localization correction .",
    "below we report also the results of the two  loop calculation .",
    "it brings the next order correction @xmath48 that also `` protects '' the early time evolution from the localization effects .",
    "it is still an open problem to sum up the entire series to develop a theory of strong localization that accounts for the ehrenfest time phenomena .",
    "most of the existing experiments on atomic gases @xcite do not fall down in the parametric regime ( [ regime ] ) , but rather have @xmath49 . in this case @xmath50 and our result , eq .  ( [ resultapp ] ) , can only be viewed as a qualitative one .",
    "we discuss below other possible realizations of the qkr that utilizes driven josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "such systems may prove to be more suitable for exploring the parametric regime ( [ regime ] ) and thus for a quantitative comparison with the theory .",

    "in particular , we calculate the frequency - dependent one - loop correction to the classical diffusion coefficient and study its effect on the momentum dispersion .",

    "the effects of noise and dephasing are subject of sec .",
    "[ noise ] .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "some technical details are delegated to appendices .",
    "the physics of the weak  localization corrections is traditionally discussed in the language of classical trajectories .",
    "the classical motion of a particle in the random potential is characterized by a rapid randomization of momenta and diffusion spreading of the coordinate .",
    "it is thus customary to visualize a trajectory in the coordinate space as a random motion between static impurities .",
    "it is straightforward to develop a similar approach for the qkr . in the kicked rotor problem",
    "the roles of coordinate and ( angular ) momentum are interchanged .",
    "indeed , for @xmath32 the angular coordinate @xmath51 is rapidly randomized ( over the interval @xmath52 $ ] ) , while the angular momentum @xmath53 acquires a ( quasi ) random change @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the latter results in the diffusion in the space of angular momentum ( see below ) . we shall thus visualize a `` trajectory '' as a sequence of values of the angular momentum that kicked rotor `` visits '' upon successive kicks , fig .",
    "[ fig2]b .    for a quantitative description of the classical motion",
    "it is convenient to monitor pairs of angle and angular momentum in discrete moments of time .",
    "this maps the classical dynamics onto a so - called standard map : @xmath55 notice that @xmath56 stands for the angular momentum immediately after @xmath57-th kick , and @xmath58 for the angle before @xmath59-th kick .",
    "it is now obvious that the two successive points of the trajectory : @xmath56 and @xmath60 differ by @xmath61 . as a first approximation one",
    "may treat @xmath58 as uniformly distributed over @xmath62 $ ] and thus @xmath63 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "an account of the residual correlations between successive @xmath58 s , leads to a renormalization of @xmath8 with the next term scaling as @xmath66 etc . @xcite . for completeness of the presentation we shall derive the full result for the classical diffusion constant in appendix [ difffewkick ] . for the current qualitative discussion it is enough to appreciate that a trajectory of the classical kicked rotor exhibits random hops in the space of angular momentum , leading to : @xmath67 this result has a simple physical interpretation : the average energy of the kicked rotor linearly increases with time , reflecting a constant rate joel s heating .",
    "it is exactly this property of the classical kicked rotor that made it useful in the accelerator physics @xcite .    in the quantum problem an _ amplitude _ to evolve from an initial to a finite point in the angular momentum space is given by the sum of _ amplitudes _ of all classically allowed trajectories passing through these two points .",
    "generically , different trajectories come with random and uncorrelated phases and thus do not produce a systematic interference contribution . an exception to",
    "this rule comes from the trajectories having almost ( up to @xmath4 ) exactly the same geometrical length and thus the same phase .",
    "this situation takes place if a trajectory contains a self  intersection point in the angular momentum space .",
    "then another trajectory may exist that is identical to the initial one safe for the direction of propagation along the loop , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] b. the fact that the backward propagation along the loop is consistent with the equations of motion is guaranteed by the time ",
    "reversal symmetry of the hamiltonian : @xmath68 ( compare it with the time - reversal symmetry in the random potential problem : @xmath69 ) .",
    "it is thus easy to see that we are interested in the loops that not only have ( almost ) coinciding initial and finite momenta : @xmath70 , but also ( almost ) opposite initial and finite angles : @xmath71 .",
    "the allowed uncertainty is limited by the effective planck constant : @xmath72 .    since such two trajectories have ( almost ) the same phase , they interfere constructively and thus lead to a systematic ( localization ) quantum correction . the probability to complete the loop in time @xmath73 is called cooperon and denoted as @xmath74 . with the above mentioned conditions on the initial and finite points one may estimate it as @xmath75 ( this must be multiplied by @xmath4 to take into account the phase area of the allowed uncertainty ) .",
    "this estimate translates ( basically by the double integration over time ) to the @xmath76 correction @xcite to the classical law : @xmath77 . at @xmath78",
    "the correction exceeds the classical result and the qkr crosses over to the strong localization regime .    the qualitative reasoning given above repeats identically the one employed in the discussion of a particle in the field of the  quantum  white  noise random potential .",
    "however , the kicked rotor dynamics possess a very important distinction from that of the white  noise potential problem .",
    "the latter is the process without a memory .",
    "indeed , two classical trajectories that identically retrace each other up to a certain point may take completely different roots ( in particular counter  propagating ones ) after a _ single _ `` quantum '' scattering event .",
    "after completing the loop in the opposite directions according to the classical random walk dynamics , another _ single _ `` quantum '' scattering makes the two trajectories to be identical again . these two ( actually four , since there are two trajectories involved ) quantum scattering events constitute the , so  called , hikami box @xcite , denoted by @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a .",
    "contrary to this scenario , the kicked rotor scattering events are purely classical , namely the free rotation of the angle .",
    "indeed the trajectory is uniquely defined by the standard map , eq .",
    "( [ standardm ] ) , sequence .",
    "if two trajectories coincide _ exactly _ at some point @xmath80 , they continue to be identical ( determined by eq .",
    "( [ standardm ] ) ) forever .",
    "this seemingly precludes any possibility to develop the weak  localization scenario , outlined above .",
    "the way out of this apparent paradox is to recall that the loop may be completed not exactly , but rather up to a small uncertainty : @xmath81 .",
    "this small initial difference is magnified ( more precisely , exponentially increases ) upon successive kicking ( lyapunov instability ) , leading eventually to the two counter  propagating diffusive roots .",
    "the situation is rather similar to the localization in the field of the _ classical _ large scale random potential ( so - called random lorentz gas ) .",
    "the latter was considered by aliener and larkin some time ago @xcite .",
    "due to complexity of the lorentz gas dynamics , they had to introduce quantum impurities ( essentially a weak white  noise component of the scattering potential ) to treat the problem analytically .",
    "the beauty of the qkr is in simplicity of its classical dynamics , eq .",
    "( [ standardm ] ) , that allows to treat the lyapunov regime exactly without involving an artificial quantum scattering .    to proceed in this direction ,",
    "consider two trajectories that initially happen to be at a small distance from each other in the phase space : @xmath82 .",
    "taking variation of eq .",
    "( [ standardm ] ) , we find that the angle difference evolves as @xmath83 . in the limit @xmath32 it leads to @xmath84 , where @xmath29 is the lyapunov exponent . for @xmath32",
    "one finds : @xmath85 @xcite with the residual term @xmath86 .",
    "for @xmath87 , the optimal value of @xmath88 is @xmath89 .",
    "it thus takes time @xmath90 , cf .",
    "( [ ehrenfest ] ) , to evolve from the initial angular uncertainty @xmath91 up to @xmath92 , when the diffusive motion takes over .",
    "once this deviation is reached , the usual diffusive spread of the two trajectories takes place . the time ",
    "reversal invariance dictates that aforementioned divergence of the two trajectories is preceded by their convergence .",
    "the latter takes another @xmath27 kicks to be completed .",
    "the total duration of the one  way travel through the lyapunov region is thus @xmath93 .",
    "the entire weak  localization loop construction requires two such travels ( each including convergence and divergence ) through the lyapunov regime . as a result ,",
    "the localization corrections are delayed by ( can not be developed in time less than ) @xmath43 , see eq .",
    "( [ resultapp ] ) .",
    "technically there are two equivalent ways to incorporate the lyapunov region into the weak  localization calculations , see fig .",
    "one approach , adopted in ref .",
    ", is to redefine hikami box to contain @xmath43 scattering events ( kicks ) instead of conventional four .",
    "then cooperon ( and the diffusons ) is just a conventional diffusive propagator in the momentum space . in the present paper we find convenient to follow the traditional treatment of hikami box as consisting of the four kicks .",
    "these four kicks are treated exactly by multiplying the corresponding quantum evolution operators .",
    "it is the analytical expression for hikami box that dictates allowed deviations of @xmath94 product .",
    "the lyapunov regimes are delegated to the `` legs '' of the cooperon ( and diffusons ) .",
    "the latter now understood as a propagator that includes both lyapunov  like divergence  convergence of the close trajectories along with the normal diffusion once a macroscopic deviation between them is reached . as we show below , the choice of the four kicks in the lyapunov regime , that coined to be hikami box is immaterial . for any such choice",
    "the quantum correction , linear in @xmath4 , is delayed by @xmath43 .",
    "it is important to mention that the time interval @xmath95 is protected from the higher order loop corrections as well . to demonstrate this fact we performed the two  loop weak  localization calculation and found the corresponding contribution @xmath96 to be delayed by @xmath97 .",
    "the delay is not absolutely sharp , but rather is slightly smeared by @xmath98 number of kicks .",
    "the reason for this smearing is in fluctuations of the exponent @xmath29 .",
    "such fluctuations are due to the fact that one follows the lyapunov instability for a finite number of kicks only .",
    "( indeed , unlike classical problems , the minimal deviation is limited by @xmath4 and thus the time to leave the lyapunov regime is finite and may fluctuate between the trajectories ) .",
    "following ref .",
    "we characterize fluctuations of the lyapunov exponent by the other exponent , @xmath99 ( for qkr with @xmath32 one finds @xmath100 ) . in the case",
    "@xmath101 , cf .",
    "( [ regime ] ) , the effect of smearing due to @xmath99 is rather small .    the predicted time ",
    "dependent momentum dispersion graph is plotted on fig .",
    "the following sections serve to quantify the qualitative semiclassical picture outlined above .",
    "we proceed now to develop the qualitative considerations outlined above into an accurate theory of the qkr .",
    "the essential starting point is the classical diffusion in the angular momentum direction of the classical phase space : @xmath102\\times [ -\\infty\\ , , + \\infty ] $ ] .",
    "we ll clarify first how to find the classical diffusion from the exact quantum correlator .",
    "one starts from introducing the exact one period quantum evolution operator as : @xmath103 all physical quantities may be expressed in terms of the matrix elements of @xmath104 , where @xmath59 stays for the number of kicks ( time ) .",
