    "in 1937 ettore majorana realized that the dirac equation could be modified to support a new class of particles called majorana fermions ( mfs ) , with the intriguing property that these particles are their own anti - particles.@xcite mathematically , if @xmath5 is the annihilation operator for a majorana particle then @xmath6 .",
    "these exotic particles are non - abelian anyons , which means that particle exchanges are not merely accompanied by a @xmath7 for bosons or a @xmath8 for fermions that multiplies the wave function .",
    "additionally , the exchange statistics of mfs does not follow the regular anyons observed as quasiparticles in 2d systems , where the exchange operation yields a berry phase @xmath9 multiplying the wave function.@xcite thus we end up for mfs with an exotic non - abelian exchange statistics . until now no elementary particle on nature was found as a mf .",
    "there is one possibility that neutrinos might be mfs . on going experiments",
    "are attempting to verify this hypothesis.@xcite despite its origin in high energy physics , mfs came recently in the news as a quasi - particle excitation in the low - energy field of solid state physics.@xcite    thus in the last few years the pursuit for devices hosting mfs has received much attention from the scientific community , in particular working with quantum computing .",
    "such a quest is due to the possibility of bounding two far apart mfs in order to define a nonlocal qubit completely immune to the decoherence effect , which is crucial for the accomplishment of a robust topological quantum computer.@xcite to this end , experimental realizations should reveal first signatures of mfs that ensure the existence of them and hence , their application as essential blocks for quantum computing .",
    "nowadays , the most promising setups for this goal lies on the superconductor based systems.@xcite    for instance , it was recently measured as a mf signature a zero - bias peak in the conductance between a normal metal and the end of a semiconductor nanowire ( insb ) that is attached to a s - wave superconductor.@xcite this superconductor induces superconductivity in the insb nanowire via the proximity effect . in the presence of a magnetic field parallel to the wire",
    "it was found a peak sticked at the midgap of the nontrivial topological superconductor .",
    "this peak is washed out for zero magnetic fields or when the magnetic field is parallel to the spin - orbit field of the wire .",
    "additionally , this peak tends to disappear when temperature increases .",
    "all these features are in agreement with theoretical works that settle the ingredients necessary to have a majorana bound state ( mbs ) in a hybrid nanowire - superconductor device.@xcite however , an alternative explanations for these measurements were later proposed.@xcite additionally , mf are expected to appear in a variety of solid state systems , namely , topological superconductors@xcite and fractional quantum hall systems@xcite . moreover , mfs are theoretically predicted to appear in a half - quantum vortex of a p - wave superconductors@xcite or at the ends of supercondutor vortices in doped topological insulators.@xcite    in solid state physics the main way to probe mbss is via conductance .",
    "a few experiments use tunneling spectroscopy to probe mfs as a zero - bias anomaly .",
    "there are some theoretical proposals that deal with transport through a single level quantum dot attached to a left and to a right lead and to a mbs in the end of a quantum wire.@xcite the main transport feature found for this system is a conductance peak pinned at zero - bias with an amplitude of one - half the ballistic conductance @xmath10,@xcite valid when the left and right leads couple symmetrically to the dot .",
    "we point out that in ref .",
    "[ , e. vernek _ et al .",
    "_ have found that such a value arises from the leaking of the mbs into the quantum dot .",
    "additionally , the transport in this system was investigated in the large bias regime , revealing a non - conserving current between left and right leads.@xcite    in the present paper we apply the keldysh nonequilibrium green s function technique@xcite to extend these previous works to the whole bias voltage window , ranging from the zero - bias limit up to the large bias regime .",
    "so , instead of focusing only on the zero - bias anomaly , we explore the whole @xmath0 curve in the presence of a single mbs . for comparison",
    "we also show the results to the case of a regular fermionic ( rf ) zero - mode coupled to the dot .",
    "both cases ( mbs and rf ) differ appreciably along the bias voltage window , not only in the zero - bias regime .",
    "we observe , for instance , the formation of an additional plateau in the i - v curve when the dot is coupled to a mbs .",
    "additionally , it is found a slope at the characteristic @xmath0 curve equal to one - half the quantum of conductance @xmath11 when the bias voltage tends to zero , in accordance to ref . [ .",
    "we pay particular attention to the coupling asymmetry between _ left lead - quantum dot _ and _ right lead - quantum dot_. these couplings are characterized by the tunneling rates @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "we investigate the cases @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "cao et al.@xcite found that in the large bias regime the current is not conserved with @xmath16 or @xmath17 depending on the asymmetry factor @xmath18 .",
    "interestingly , the nonconserving feature also affects the zero - bias conductance .",
    "the zero - bias limit departs from @xmath4 when the leads couple asymmetrically ( @xmath19 ) to the dot .",
    "we have found in the zero - bias limit @xmath20 and @xmath21 or the opposite , depending on the degree of asymmetry @xmath22 .",
    "neither @xmath23 nor @xmath24 coincide with the conductance obtained via the landauer - bttiker equation in linear response regime , except for symmetric couplings ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this indicates that a full nonequilibrium quantum transport formulation is more suitable to describe the system with majorana bound state .",
    "thermal effects are also investigated .",
    "we observe that when the temperature is large enough both mbs and rf cases become indistinguishable for any bias voltage .",

    "the fourth term accounts for the majorana modes , and the last two terms can be understood as follows : ( i ) @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 we have a regular fermionic ( rf ) zero - mode attached to the quantum dot and ( ii ) for @xmath35 we obtain a mbs coupled to the quantum dot . in case ( i )",

    "<S> additionally , we observe the formation of a plateau in the characteristic @xmath0 curve for intermediate bias voltages when the dot is coupled to a mbs . </S>",

    "<S> we note that when the temperature of the reservoirs is large enough both rf and mbs cases coincide for all bias voltages . </S>"
