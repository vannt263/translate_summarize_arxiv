    "cosmological gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are huge explosions of energy @xmath0  ergs , which may be triggered , e.g. , by coalescence of neutron stars and/or black holes .",
    "the created fireball expands relativistically , with a lorentz factor @xmath1 . in the most likely scenario ,",
    "the observed gamma - rays are produced at times @xmath2  s after the explosion , when the relativistic outflow gets optically thin and before it is decelerated by the surrounding medium ( see , e.g. , piran 1999 for a review ) .",
    "the outflow has a fluctuating velocity profile , and the @xmath3-rays are generated by internal shocks that develop when faster shells try to overtake slower ones ( rees & mszros 1994 ) .",
    "the internal dissipation was discussed and simulated numerically in a number of works ( e.g. , kobayashi , sari , & piran 1997 ; daigne & mochkovitch 1998 ; lazzati , ghisellini , & celotti 1999 ; panaitescu , spada , & mszros 1999 ; spada , panaitescu , mszros 1999 ; kumar 1999 ) .",
    "it was concluded that only a few percent of the total kinetic energy is emitted to infinity ( e.g. , panaitescu et al . 1999 ; kumar 1999 ) . then the energy of the prompt grb should be dominated by the early afterglow associated with an external shock .",
    "observations show the opposite .",
    "besides , the low efficiency requires huge explosion energies .",
    "the conclusion that the internal dissipation has a low efficiency was based on certain assumptions :    \\(1 ) a specific probability distribution was assumed for the outflow lorentz factor , such that the root - mean - square ( rms ) of the fluctuations was less than @xmath4 ( see eq . [ 11 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the rms can be much higher .",
    "\\(2 ) the fluctuations were taken with a white ( flat ) spectrum .",
    "\\(3 ) it was often assumed that the dissipated energy is equally distributed between the electrons , protons , and magnetic field , and only the electron part is radiated .",
    "in fact , the radiative capability of shocked matter is highly uncertain and dependent on poorly understood plasma processes .",
    "the high radiative capability is favored by the observed high luminosities of the prompt grbs .",
    "if most of the dissipated energy is transferred to the electrons and radiated , the outflow stays at low pressure and the coasting matter gets concentrated into thin shells ( caustics ) .    in   2 , we give a simple analytical description for dissipation of white fluctuations with modest rms ( the linear regime ) .",
    "then the efficiency is proportional to the mean square of the initial fluctuations . in  3 , we study high - amplitude fluctuations .",
    "the efficiency then approaches 100  % .",
    "the analytical results are illustrated with numerical simulations .",
    "the size of the central engine , @xmath5  cm corresponds to a typical time scale @xmath6  ms .",
    "the outflow generated by the engine can have highly correlated parameters on this time scale , so that portions @xmath7 can be considered as individual shells in the continuous outflow .",
    "the outflow is then discretized as a sequence of such shells , @xmath8 , with mass @xmath9 and energy input @xmath10 .",
    "one after another , the shells are accelerated to a lorentz factor @xmath11 ( @xmath10 gets converted into the bulk kinetic energy ) on the time - scale @xmath12  s ( see piran 1999 ) .",
    "subsequent evolution of the outflow proceeds in the coasting regime until the shells begin to collide .",
    "suppose @xmath13 is a white noise with the average value @xmath14 and initial rms @xmath15 .",
    "masses of the shells can be taken equal , @xmath16 , or also fluctuating  the results will be the same .",
    "the initial scale of the fluctuations is @xmath17 .",
    "the collision process starts at @xmath18 after time @xmath19 , the first generation of shell coalescence has been done ( the typical mass of a shell increases by a factor of two ) , then the second generation occurs , and so on . in the process of hierarchical coalescence , the scale of the fluctuations increases , @xmath20 , as well as the average mass of an individual shell , @xmath21 .",
    "the fluctuations look especially simple when viewed from the frame moving with lorentz factor @xmath14 .",
    "we will denote quantities measured in this frame by symbols with tilde .",
    "the fluctuation velocity is @xmath22 .",
    "given @xmath23 , we have @xmath24 with the average @xmath25 and the rms , @xmath26 the outflow motion is thus decomposed into two parts : the relativistic motion of the center - of - momentum ( cm ) with a lorentz factor @xmath27 and superimposed non - relativistic fluctuations .",
    "the hierarchical coalescence of shells can be expected to occur in a self - similar regime , so that the collisional time - scale for one generation is about the time passed since the explosion , @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is the scale of the fluctuations in the cm - frame .",
    "after coalescence of @xmath30 shells with initial momentum @xmath31 , the new big shell has a momentum @xmath32 ( this is the random walk formula : @xmath30 momenta @xmath33 are summed with random sign ) .",
    "we thus have , @xmath34 combining ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , we get the self - similar solution describing the hierarchical coalescence at @xmath35 , @xmath36 note that the collisions establish a gaussian distribution of @xmath37 .",
    "one can therefore prescribe a temperature to the system of shells , @xmath38 , which is related to the average kinetic energy by @xmath39 ( shells have one degree of freedom ) . from equation ( 5 )",
    "it follows that @xmath40 .",
    "the evolution of shells can thus be described as isothermal sticking together .",
    "the free energy of the outflow is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the total mass of the outflow .",
    "this energy is available for dissipation . from equation",
    "( 5 ) one gets @xmath43 in figure  1 , we illustrate solution ( 5 ) by direct numerical simulations .",
    "most of the free energy is dissipated at @xmath44 .",
    "it should be compared with the time at which the outflow gets optically thin , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the mass outflow rate and @xmath47 is the kinetic luminosity ( assuming a spherical outflow ) . in the case of @xmath48 , dissipation starts at @xmath49 .",
    "the free energy remaining in the outflow by the transparency moment is @xmath50 , and most of the energy is dissipated at the optically thick stage .",
    "the radiation produced at @xmath51 is trapped in the plasma whose volume increases proportionally to @xmath52 .",
    "as a result of adiabatic cooling , the volume - integrated radiation energy is reduced as @xmath53 .",
    "the energy conservation law implies that the adiabatic cooling is accompanied by a regular radial acceleration of shells in the outward direction .",
    "the energy of trapped radiation is thus spent to accelerate the outflow cm , and it is lost as a free energy .",
    "a fraction @xmath54 of the radiation energy survives till @xmath55 and contributes to the observed luminosity , @xmath56 the radiative efficiency ( the ratio of @xmath57 to the explosion energy ) is @xmath58 here , @xmath59 is the initial amplitude of the fluctuations .    in the case of @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 and all the radiated free energy",
    "will escape .",
    "then , @xmath62    if the initial lorentz factor takes random values between @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( as assumed in most of the previous works ) , then @xmath65    since @xmath66 in equation ( 11 ) , @xmath67 does not exceed @xmath68  % .",
    "if one further assumes that only 1/3 of the energy is actually radiated and the other 2/3 are stored as internal energy subject to adiabatic cooling , then the efficiency is reduced by a factor of 3 ( 2/3 of the dissipated energy is then spent to accelerate the cm ) .",
    "one thus arrives at @xmath69  % limit on @xmath67 .",
    "= 8.1 cm    numerical simulations of kobayashi et al .",
    "( 1997 ; see their table  1 ) are in good agreement with equations ( 10,11 ) , except for the case where @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( their parameter @xmath72 ) .",
    "one can show that in this special case @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the outflow dynamics is then non - linear ( even though @xmath75 ) , similar to the high amplitude case we study in   3 .",
    "suppose that @xmath76 fluctuates with a log - normal distribution , @xmath77 here , @xmath78 measures the amplitude of the fluctuations . at @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 , so that @xmath81 and @xmath82 . at @xmath83",
    "we are in the high - amplitude regime .",
    "the possibility of high efficiencies at @xmath83 can be understood when comparing two global characteristics of the outflow : the cm lorentz factor and the specific energy , @xmath84 ( in units of @xmath85 ) . for definiteness , take a uniform initial distribution of mass .",
    "then , @xmath86 @xmath87 it easy to show that at high amplitudes @xmath88 , i.e. , the chaotic ( free ) component of the kinetic energy is much larger than the regular component .",
    "if the dissipation occurs in the optically thin regime and the emitted radiation is approximately isotropic in the cm - frame , then the momentum conservation law implies @xmath89 .",
    "when the dissipation is done , the final kinetic energy is about @xmath90 , i.e. , almost all the explosion energy has been radiated to infinity .",
    "in fact , in the high - amplitude case , the fluctuations start to dissipate very early , much before the transparency moment .",
    "the optically thick dissipation accelerates the cm , as discussed in   2 :",
    "the free energy gets transformed into the bulk motion of the outflow as a whole .",
    "the process is non - linear : the cm is substantially accelerated , in contrast to the low - amplitude case .",
    "it tends to reduce the initially big difference between @xmath91 and @xmath84 by increasing @xmath91 , while @xmath84 stays at the initial value , @xmath92 .",
    "if at the transparency moment the ratio @xmath93 is still high , then a high efficiency can be expected : the dissipation at the optically thin stage converts the difference between @xmath94 and @xmath95 into the observed radiation .",
    "note also , that the radiation produced before the transparency moment is not completely lost .",
    "even being cooled adiabatically , it contributes substantially to the outgoing luminosity .",
    "we now illustrate with numerical simulations .",
    "we generate a sequence of @xmath96 thin shells with initial separation 1  ms .",
    "their lorentz factor fluctuates according to equation ( 12 ) .",
    "the shells have equal mass @xmath97 .",
    "note that the results depend on the initial mass distribution ( in contrast to the linear case ) , and @xmath16 is taken as a simple example .",
    "the duration of the central engine activity is 3  s. the results do not change substantially if one takes longer activity : each 1  s portion of the outflow is causally disconnected from the other portions during the main emission time , @xmath98  s.    the transparency moment , @xmath55 , is roughly estimated by equation ( 8) with @xmath99 .",
    "the transition from the optically thick to optically thin regime is treated in the simplest way : ( 1 ) if two shells merge at @xmath51 , we assume that no radiation is emitted . instead",
    ", the radiation is trapped and contributes to the kinetic energy of the new big shell . in other words ,",
    "shell coalescence at @xmath51 proceeds with conservation of energy , @xmath100 .",
    "a fraction @xmath54 of radiation trapped at moment @xmath101 survives till @xmath55 and contributes to the luminosity , @xmath57 .",
    "( 2 ) at @xmath102 , only specific momentum conserves in the coalescence events .",
    "the energy released in the inelastic collision is radiated away isotropically in the rest frame of the newly formed shell .",
    "we consider models of two types .",
    "model i : @xmath103  s and @xmath104 in equation ( 12 ) is adjusted in such a way that @xmath105 after the dissipation is finished .",
    "model ii : @xmath106  s and @xmath104 is adjusted to get the final @xmath107 . in both models , the isotropic kinetic luminosity , @xmath108  erg  s@xmath109 .",
    "the outflow forms by @xmath110  s and after that it has a well defined cm with a velocity @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the total momentum and @xmath113 is the total energy of the outflow .",
    "( note that the initial @xmath92 depends on the specific statistical realization @xmath13 and it varies around the average expected value given by eq .",
    "[ 14 ] ) . in figure  2 , we show examples of the non - linear evolution of @xmath84 and @xmath91 in models i and ii . at high @xmath78 , the radiation is mostly produced by shells moving faster than the cm , and this results in the cm deceleration at @xmath102 .    then , we compute a sequence of models and find the efficiency , @xmath114 , as a function of @xmath78 ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "at @xmath79 , we are in the linear regime of   2 .",
    "shells begin to collide at @xmath115 and then evolve according to solution ( 5 ) . model  ii ( @xmath116 ) is in perfect agreement with equation ( 10 ) .",
    "the efficiency of model  i ( @xmath117 ) is reduced as a result of adiabatic losses during the optically thick stage .",
    "at @xmath83 , the efficiency increases up to @xmath118  % in model  i , and up to 96  % in model  ii .",
    "the global parameters of the outflow show substantial variations depending on the particular realization of the initial @xmath13 .",
    "figure  3 shows @xmath67 averaged for many realizations and its standard deviation .",
    "figure  4 shows examples of the generated light curves .",
    "each coalescence event produces a pulse of a standard shape corresponding to a thin instantaneously radiating shell .",
    "the observed pulse has a width @xmath119 , where @xmath101 is the time at which the radiation leaves the shell .",
    "although the initial fluctuations are gaussian , the non - linear dissipation generates a highly correlated signal which is a mixture of quiescent periods and periods of strong activity .",
    "such a behavior is observed in grbs and this special feature is naturally explained by the non - linear model .",
    "there is another special feature of the non - linear regime .",
    "the effective temperature of fluctuations in the cm - frame is relativistic , and an additional emission mechanism appears : inverse compton scattering ( ic ) on the bulk motions ( see also lazzati et al .",
    "this mechanism does not work at the optically thick stage since the radiation is trapped and follows the motions of shells .",
    "however , when the outflow gets optically thin , the radiation can propagate and promote momentum exchange between the shells without direct collisions ( like silk damping in the early universe ) . this effect should be accounted for in future .",
    "we expect that it will not change crucially the efficiency because : ( 1 ) anyway , the free energy is radiated away , whatever dissipation mechanism works .",
    "( 2 ) photon exchange does not crucially enhance the rate of dissipation because direct collisions also occur with relativistic velocities in the cm - frame .",
    "the ic by bulk motions can provide an observational test for the model .",
    "in particular , it can explain the high energy tail sometimes observed in grb spectra .",
    "the photons emitted by internal shocks ( with energy @xmath120  kev ) are boosted in energy by a factor of @xmath121 , resulting in gev emission ."
