    "the parrondo effect , in which there is a reversal in direction in some system parameter when two similar dynamics are combined , is the result of an underlying nonlinearity .",
    "it was first described by j. m. r. parrondo in 1996 in the context of games of chance : he showed that it is possible to combine two losing games to produce a winning one .",
    "his idea has inspired research in such diverse areas as chemistry @xcite , evolutionary biology @xcite , population genetics @xcite , finance @xcite , reliability theory @xcite , chaos @xcite , fractals @xcite , epistemology @xcite , quantum mechanics @xcite , and probability theory @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we analyze a discrete dynamical system , introduced by dins and parrondo @xcite , that models the short - range optimization , or greedy , strategy at collective parrondo games .",
    "our analysis gives conditions under which the parrondo effect is present .",
    "let us describe parrondo s original example .",
    "the so - called capital - dependent parrondo games consist of two games , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in game @xmath7",
    ", the player wins one unit with probability @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a small bias parameter , and loses one unit otherwise .",
    "game @xmath8 is played with two coins , the one tossed depending on the current capital of the player : if the player s current capital is divisible by 3 , he tosses a `` bad '' coin with probability of heads @xmath11 , otherwise he tosses a `` good '' coin with probability of heads @xmath12 ; he wins one unit with heads and loses one unit with tails .",
    "it can be shown that when @xmath13 , both games @xmath7 and @xmath8 are fair , hence losing when @xmath14 .",
    "however , the random mixture @xmath15 , in which game @xmath7 is played with probability @xmath16 and game @xmath8 is played with probability @xmath17 , is winning for @xmath10 sufficiently small .",
    "furthermore , the non - random pattern @xmath18 $ ] , denoting @xmath19 plays of game @xmath7 followed by @xmath20 plays of game @xmath8 ( repeated ad infinitum ) , is also winning for @xmath10 sufficiently small , except when @xmath21 . in summary , two losing ( or fair ) games can be combined , by random mixture or nonrandom alternation , to create a winning game .",
    "this was the original form of _ parrondo s paradox_. see @xcite for survey articles .",
    "dins and parrondo @xcite formulated a modification of the capital - dependent parrondo games in which a fraction of an infinite number of players collectively choose and individually play the same game at each turn .",
    "they found that , in certain cases , by choosing the game that yields the maximum average profit at each turn , the surprising result is systematic losses ( if @xmath14 ) , whereas a random or nonrandom sequence of choices yields a steady increase in average profit .",
    "van den broeck and cleuren @xcite considered also the case of a finite number of players .",
    "they evaluated the expected profit for this greedy strategy as a function of the number of players and proved that the strategy is optimal when the number of players is one or two but suboptimal when it is three or infinite .    in this paper",
    "we consider only the case of infinitely many players , and we adopt the one - parameter family of capital - dependent parrondo games of ethier and lee @xcite given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath24 ; the original parrondo game @xmath8 , assumed by dins and parrondo @xcite and van den broeck and cleuren @xcite , corresponds to @xmath2 . in order to focus on the case in which two fair games produce a winning game , we assume that @xmath0 for game @xmath8 and @xmath13 for both games .",
    "the fraction of players who play at each turn , denoted here by @xmath3 ( as in @xcite ) , was assumed to be 1/2 or 27/40 by dins and parrondo @xcite and to be 1 by van den broeck and cleuren @xcite .",
    "here we let @xmath3 range over the interval @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "behrends @xcite introduced a stochastic model that includes our ( deterministic ) model as a special case , and he proved that the sequence of expected ( or average ) profits is eventually quasiperiodic under certain assumptions .",
    "this paper develops , in the context of the dins  parrondo model , techniques for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of a piecewise - linear discrete dynamical system , and may therefore be of interest even to readers unfamiliar with parrondo s paradox .    in section [ prelim ]",
    "we formulate a piecewise - linear discrete dynamical system for the capital - dependent parrondo games played collectively according to the greedy strategy ; it is parametrized by @xmath4 $ ] . in section [ bforever ]",
    "we show that , in one region of the parameter space ( namely , @xmath5 ) , game @xmath8 is eventually played forever , resulting in an asymptotically fair game and , in terms of the discrete dynamical system , a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium . in section [ periodic ] we show that , in the remainder of the parameter space ( namely , @xmath6 ) , there is an initial state that yields a periodic pattern of games , resulting in an asymptotically winning game and , in terms of the discrete dynamical system , a limit cycle .",
    "in fact , in a very small region of the parameter space , there are two limit cycles .",
    "section [ stability ] attempts to show that ( again assuming @xmath6 ) , where there is a unique limit cycle it is asymptotically stable ( in fact , it is globally asymptotically stable unless there is an unstable equilibrium ) .",
    "the proofs of the assertions in section [ stability ] are incomplete , so some of our findings are stated as conjectures . in section [ profit ]",
    "we confirm the assertions just made concerning the asymptotic profitability of the greedy strategy .",
    "for example , if @xmath26 ( and @xmath13 ) , our results show that there is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium with game @xmath8 eventually played forever .",
    "this is contrary to a computational result of dins and parrondo @xcite , who found the pattern @xmath27 $ ] in this case ( i.e. , @xmath28 ) . the anomaly is likely attributable to roundoff error ; 64-bit arithmetic ( c++ ) is insufficient here .",
    "let us introduce some additional notation . as defined in the second paragraph above , the game pattern @xmath29 $ ] stands for @xmath30 .",
    "it will be useful to have a concise notation for game sequences that are eventually periodic .",
    "we write @xmath31 , for example , as @xmath32 , just as one would write the binary expansion of the fraction 5/14 as @xmath33 .    with this notation",
    ", we can describe the limit cycles that appear in terms of the game patterns .",
    "they are of two types , either one of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ,  , or one of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ,  . for further simplicity",
    ", we will also denote these patterns by @xmath29 $ ] , @xmath40 $ ] , @xmath41 $ ] ,  , and by @xmath42 $ ] , @xmath43 $ ] , @xmath44 $ ] ,  .",
    "it is well known that a markov chain @xmath45 with state space @xmath46 underlies the capital - dependent parrondo games ; here @xmath47 represents the player s capital modulo 3 after @xmath48 games .",
    "when playing game @xmath8 it evolves according to the one - step transition matrix @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "when playing game @xmath7 it evolves according to the one - step transition matrix @xmath53 defined by the matrix in ( [ pbcirc ] ) with @xmath54 ( i.e. , with @xmath55 ) .",
    "the unique stationary distribution @xmath56 of @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 while that of @xmath53 is @xmath59 .",
    "given @xmath60 , consider a large number @xmath61 of players , of whom @xmath62 are selected at random .",
    "everyone in the sample of size @xmath62 independently plays game @xmath7 or everyone independently plays game @xmath8 , the choice determined by the strategy .",
    "when playing game @xmath8 , each player uses his own capital to determine which coin to toss .",
    "let @xmath63 be the fraction of the players whose capital is divisible by 3 after @xmath48 turns . if the players in the sample collectively choose and individually play game @xmath8 , then the expected average profit , conditioned on @xmath63 , is equal to @xmath64(2 p_1 -1 ) = - x_0(n ) { 1-\\rho^2\\over1+\\rho^2 } + [ 1-x_0(n)]{1-\\rho\\over1+\\rho},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is nonpositive if and only if @xmath65 . game @xmath7 always has expected average profit equal to 0 .",
    "so the strategy of maximizing the expected average profit at each turn can be summarized by the rules `` play game @xmath7 if @xmath66 '' and `` play game @xmath8 if @xmath67 . '' in particular , if both games have expected average profit equal to 0 , then game @xmath7 is played .",
    "we investigate the mean - field limit as @xmath68 , in which case the model is deterministic .",
    "( we will not try to justify this ; the preceding paragraph was included mainly for motivation . )",
    "let @xmath69 represent the fraction of players whose capital is congruent to @xmath70 ( mod 3 ) for @xmath71",
    ". then @xmath72 .",
    "thus , in the state space defined by @xmath73 we have a discrete dynamical system given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 and @xmath77 . clearly , the function @xmath78 is piecewise linear but discontinuous .",

    "in fact , we could redefine @xmath78 in terms of @xmath84 matrices , but this does not appear to simplify matters .    to study the asymptotic behavior of the system , we will need the spectral representation for matrices @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we note that @xmath87 is also the unique stationary distribution of @xmath86 .",
    "the nonunit eigenvalues of @xmath88 are given by @xmath89 and @xmath90 , where , with @xmath91 , @xmath92 are the nonunit eigenvalues of @xmath57 .",
