    ", @xmath12 however this is computationally infeasible .",

    ", a central problem is to construct the compressed sensing matrices so that the solution to @xmath14 is the same as that to @xmath15 .",
    "one of the most commonly used frameworks for the compressed sensing matrices @xmath8 is the restricted isometry property ( rip ) which was introduced by cands and tao @xcite .",
    "rip has been used in the randomized construction of cs matrices ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "another well - known framework in compressed sensing is the mutual incoherence property ( mip ) of donoho and huo @xcite .",
    "several deterministic constructions of cs matrices are based on mip , e.g. , @xcite .",

    "recently , li , gao , ge , and zhang @xcite suggested a deterministic construction of of binary cs matrices via algebraic curves over finite fields .",
    "as stated in @xcite , their construction is more flexible and slightly improves devore s result when @xmath26 is large ( in fact the examples in @xcite indicate that one sees improvement only when @xmath27{m}})$ ] ) .",
    "it is remarked that , in terms of construction via mip , the bound ( [ devore_bound ] ) is asymptotically optimal because of the welch lower bound @xcite ( details will be given in section 2 ) .",

    "using new estimates for sumsets in product sets and for exponential sums with the products of sets possessing special additive structure , bourgain , dilworth , ford , konyagin and kutzarva @xcite were able to overcome the natural barrier @xmath28 .",

    "compared with binary matrices , the class of fourier matrices is of great theoretical and practical relevance to compressed sensing . a notable technique of designing random partial fourier matrices",

    "such matrices are cs matrices for recovering a @xmath23-sparse signal whenever @xmath39 .",
    "however , the restriction on the matrix size ( @xmath36 and @xmath26 ) is heavy .",
    "in fact , one can only construct such partial fourier matrices for some very special parameters @xmath40 with small @xmath29 ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the main results are given in section [ sec : main_res ] .",

    "assume that each @xmath54 is of unit ( euclidean ) length .",
    "the mutual incoherence constant ( mic ) is defined as @xmath55 even though in many situations a small @xmath56 is desired , the following well - known result of welch @xcite indicates that @xmath56 is bounded below @xmath57    in @xcite , donoho and huo gave a computationally verifiable condition on the parameter @xmath56 that ensures the sparse signal recovery : let @xmath8 be a concatenation of two orthonormal matrices .",
    "assume @xmath6 is @xmath23-sparse . if @xmath58 then the solution @xmath59 for @xmath14 is exactly @xmath6 .",
    "this result of @xcite was extended to a general matrix @xmath8 by fuchs @xcite , and , gribonval and nielsen @xcite , both in the noiseless case . for the noisy case of the bounded error",
    ", @xcite proved that @xmath0-minimization gives a stable approximation of the signal @xmath6 under some conditions that are stronger than ( [ mip ] ) .",
    "the open problem of whether condition ( [ mip ] ) , namely @xmath60 , is sufficient for stable approximation of @xmath6 in the noisy case was settled by cai , wang and xu in @xcite  actually the authors of @xcite even proved that this condition is sharp , for both noisy and noiseless cases .",
    "another remark is that if one considers only the noiseless case , the proof in @xcite simplifies that of @xcite    although the sparse recovery condition ( [ mip ] ) is rather strong , it is advantageous in checking whether a matrix meets the condition .",
    "such a checking procedure requires @xmath61 steps which is computationally feasible .",
    "the mic @xmath56 has been explicitly used in the design of compressed sensing matrices by several works , e.g. , @xcite .",

    "<S> the class of fourier matrices is of special importance in compressed sensing ( cs ) . </S>",
    "<S> this paper concerns deterministic construction of compressed sensing matrices from fourier matrices . by using katz character sum estimation </S>",
    "<S> , we are able to design a deterministic procedure to select rows from a fourier matrix to form a good compressed sensing matrix for sparse recovery . the sparsity bound in our construction is similar to that of binary cs matrices constructed by devore which greatly improves previous results for cs matrices from fourier matrices . </S>",
    "<S> our approach also provides more flexibilities in terms of the dimension of cs matrices . as a consequence , our construction yields an approximately mutually unbiased bases from fourier matrices which is of particular interest to quantum information theory . </S>",
    "<S> this paper also contains a useful improvement to katz character sum estimation for quadratic extensions , with an elementary and transparent proof . </S>",
