    "the oort cloud is a spherical comet reservoir surrounding the solar system @xcite .",
    "observations and statistical studies estimate that it consists of more than 10@xmath6 comets and is on the order of 10@xmath7 - 10@xmath8 au in size ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this structure can be described as an assembly of comets whose perihelion distances extend outside the planetary region , aphelion distances smaller than the tidal radius of the sun ( @xmath21 pc ) , and a nearly isotropic inclination distribution .",
    "now it is generally accepted that the comets are residual planetesimals from planet formation and are originally inside the planetary region .    in the standard scenario of the oort cloud formation",
    ", these residual planetesimals with small eccentricities and inclinations are scattered by giant planets and their semimajor axes and eccentricities are raised .",
    "such planetesimals with large aphelion distances are affected by external forces .",
    "the perihelion distances are pulled out of the planetary region and the inclinations are randomized by external forces and then the spherical structure of the oort cloud is attained .",
    "the perturbation from passing stars is the only external force considered in the original oort scenario .",
    "many authors have studied the effect of the external forces and now we recognize that not only passing stars , but also the galactic disk and giant molecular clouds are effective perturbers ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    among these external forces",
    ", the most effective one is the galactic tide ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the galactic tide can efficiently raise the perihelion distances of planetesimals with large semimajor axes and eccentricities .",
    "@xcite derived the analytical formulae for time evolution of orbital elements of planetesimals under the effect of the galactic tide .",
    "they considered the vertical component of the galactic tide against the galactic plane , which is @xmath2 10 times larger than the other components .",
    "they showed that the inclination distribution attained by the galactic tide in 5 gyr is far from the isotropic one , which is expected from the observations of long - period comets .",
    "this is because the galactic tide causes , not the randomization , but the periodic oscillations of orbital elements and the synchronized evolution of the orbital elements produces two peaks in the inclination distribution . also , the inclination range attained by the vertical component of the galactic tide is not from 0 to 180@xmath9 , but the function of the inclination of the ecliptic plane against the galactic plane . in the case of the solar system , a planetesimal initially on the ecliptic plane can not attain an inclination larger than 153@xmath9 .    passing stars",
    "randomize and eject planetesimals from the solar system by giving velocity kicks , while the vertical component of the galactic tidal force does not change the energy of the planetesimals .",
    "the perturbations from passing stars , due to their random - walk nature , may play an important role in the production of the nearly isotropic inclination distribution of planetesimals .",
    "many authors have examined this effect , mainly by analytical approach ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their main interest is in the production of long - period comets from the spherical oort cloud .",
    "the direct simulation of the oort cloud formation including the perturbations from giant planets , the galactic disk , and passing stars was first done by @xcite and redone by @xcite with more realistic initial conditions .",
    "@xcite showed the time evolution of the mean eccentricity and inclination of planetesimals and their dependencies on the initial semimajor axes . in their calculation , the mean values expected for the isotropic distribution of planetesimals are attained in 4.5 gyr , for the semimajor axis larger than 10@xmath10 - 2@xmath11 au .",
    "however , the time evolution of the distributions of the eccentricities and inclinations , and the role of stellar encounters in their evolution are not clarified .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the effect of stellar encounters on the evolution of a planetesimal disk , from the point of view of oort cloud formation .",
    "we obtain ( i ) the impact parameters that describe the evolution timescales of the orbital elements .",
    "( ii ) the decay timescales ( @xmath0-folding time ) of surviving comets in the solar system , and its radial variations , and ( iii ) the evolution of the semimajor axis distribution in the oort cloud .",
    "we use the classical impulse approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to calculate the velocity change of planetesimals induced by stellar encounters .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : we first describe the basic dynamics of planetesimals due to a stellar encounter in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we describe the numerical model of our simulations .",
    "the results are presented in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to a summary and discussion .",
    "we use the classical impulse approximation to calculate the velocity change given by a stellar encounter @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "a planetesimal is held fixed with respect to the sun , a star passes with constant velocity along the straight line , and the time intervals before and after the closest approach are assumed to be infinity .",
    "then , the velocity change of the planetesimal is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the gravitational constant , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the stellar mass and velocity , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the position vectors to the star from the planetesimal and the sun , respectively .",
    "in this section , we derive the impact parameters that can be the indexes for the orbital evolution .",
    "we deal only with planetesimals that have the orbital velocity much lower than the typical passing star , i.e. , the planetesimals with @xmath18 au .",
    "assuming @xmath19 , we use the following simplified equation instead of equation ( [ eq : cia ] ) , @xmath20    substituting @xmath21 into equation ( [ eq : dv_ip ] ) , we obtain the impact parameter of the star - planetesimal encounter that gives the velocity change large enough to escape from the solar system , @xmath22 where @xmath3 is the heliocentric distance of the planetesimal and we used @xmath23 .",
    "this condition is basically satisfied when a planetesimal is near its aphelia . when @xmath24 , @xmath25 in equation ( [ eq : dv_ip ] ) is substituted by @xmath26 .",

    "we can see that the galactic tide ( 1 ) accelerates the flare - up of the disk , especially at the beginning , and ( 2 ) produces a wave - like structure propagating inward .",
    "the wave is due to the nature of the galactic tide that causes a periodic oscillation of the inclinations against the galactic plane ( @xmath265 ) .",

    "in contrast , @xmath44 and @xmath231 for @xmath132 decrease inversely proportionally to @xmath3 .",
    "this indicates that the efficiency of the planetesimal supply from the inner oort cloud to the outer oort cloud strongly depends on the @xmath126-distribution .",

    "but in detail , we can see that the galactic tide increases @xmath44 and @xmath231 and reduces @xmath57 .",

    "we found that , in any disk model , the decay rate of the outer oort cloud is smaller than the standard exponential decay rate ( @xmath279 ) because of the sufficient supply of planetesimals from the inner oort cloud .",
