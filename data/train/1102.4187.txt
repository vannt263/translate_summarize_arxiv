    "as explained in the main text , heat flow under reverse thermal bias is blocked because the golden - rule rates for hopping into the right dot are exponentially suppressed .",
    "this blockade can be lifted by coherent tunneling of electrons through both junctions simultaneously , with most of the energy contributed by the hot left reservoir .",
    "there are two different processes which can lift the blockade : if the system is initially in the @xmath18 state , particles can tunnel into both dots and the system ends up in the @xmath21 state . if , on the other hand , we start with the @xmath19 state , one particle hops out of the left dot and another one into the right dot , leaving the system in the @xmath20 state . here",
    "we calculate the rates for these virtual transitions and show that in the parameter range relevant for diode operation they are negligible compared to sequential processes .",
    "the rates for two - particle transitions can be calculated from the general expression @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the tunneling hamiltonian , @xmath116 the uncoupled hamiltonian , and @xmath117 the probability weight for the initial states .",
    "for the process @xmath118 the final state is related to the initial state by @xmath119 .",
    "note that this only applies to the case when the excitations for both dots are electrons .",
    "if , for instance , the excitation tunneling into the right dot is a hole , one should make the change @xmath120 .",
    "however , the formulas below will be identical in all the different cases . writing the rate explicitly for metallic islands yields @xmath121f_r(\\varepsilon_r)[1-f_r(\\varepsilon_{dr})]\\times\\\\ & \\left|\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_l-\\varepsilon_{dl}-e_{l0 } -\\frac{i}{2}\\gamma_{10 } } +   \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_r-\\varepsilon_{dr}-e_{r0}-\\frac{i}{2}\\gamma_{01 } } \\right|^2 \\delta(\\varepsilon_l+\\varepsilon_r-\\varepsilon_{dl}-\\varepsilon_{dr}-e_{l0}-e_{r0}-u ) . \\end{split}\\ ] ] the two energy denominators correspond to the two different orderings in which the electron hoppings can occur . to regularize the divergences of the denominators we have introduced the inverse lifetimes @xmath122 of the state @xmath22 , calculated with the lowest - order golden rule .",
    "thus we have , for example , @xmath123 . in the case of quantum dots",
    "the corresponding rate is @xmath124 for the other relevant cotunneling process , from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , the metallic system has @xmath125f_l(\\varepsilon_{dl})f_r(\\varepsilon_r)[1-f_r(\\varepsilon_{dr})]\\times\\\\ & \\left|\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{dl}-\\varepsilon_l - e_{l0 } -\\frac{i}{2}\\gamma_{00 } } +   \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_r-\\varepsilon_{dr}-e_{r1}-\\frac{i}{2}\\gamma_{11 } } \\right|^2 \\delta(-\\varepsilon_l+\\varepsilon_r+\\varepsilon_{dl}-\\varepsilon_{dr}+e_{l0}-e_{r0 } ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] and analogously for the quantum dot setup .",
    "equations ( [ island ] ) and ( [ island2 ] ) suggest that for the metallic system it is useful to define new integration variables @xmath126 .",
    "then with the help of the identities @xmath127= n_\\alpha(\\varepsilon_{d\\alpha})[f_\\alpha(\\varepsilon_{d\\alpha})- f_\\alpha(\\varepsilon^\\prime_\\alpha+\\varepsilon_{d\\alpha})]$ ] and @xmath128 = \\varepsilon^\\prime_\\alpha$ ] the variables @xmath37 can be integrated out . for both metallic and quantum dot cases",
    "the delta function can be used to eliminate another of the remaining integration variables , and then all the tunneling rates can be expressed with a single equation : @xmath129 where @xmath130 for quantum dots and @xmath131 for a metallic system .",
    "for the @xmath118 transition the parameters are @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 , and for the @xmath135 transition they are @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 .",
    "it is important to notice that eq .",
    "( [ common ] ) gives the total transition rates , including both sequential tunneling and cotunneling.@xcite sequential contribution comes from the resonance peaks at @xmath139 and @xmath139 , while the rest , due to the peak in the function @xmath140 , is the cotunneling contribution .",
    "the sequential rate can therefore be calculated by taking the limit @xmath141 .",
    "we get @xmath142 this is exactly the result one would expect ; for example , the first term in the @xmath118 process is the rate of the @xmath143 transition , multiplied by the probability that the next transition leads to @xmath21 .",
    "the second term similarly gives the rate for the process @xmath144 .    to calculate the cotunneling rate we note that for @xmath145 we can approximate @xmath146 for the quantum dot system",
    "this function has a peak at @xmath147 and it decays exponentially with @xmath148 and @xmath5 for positive and negative @xmath149 , respectively . in this region",
    "we can approximate @xmath150 and therefore the cotunneling contribution can be extracted by setting @xmath151 in eq .",
    "( [ common ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath152 for quantum dots .",
    "similar considerations apply also in the metallic case , and the cotunneling rate is @xmath153 the relevance of cotunneling can now be estimated by comparing the magnitudes of @xmath154 and @xmath155 . for a symmetric system , @xmath39 , with @xmath156 , we have @xmath157 where @xmath158 for quantum dots and @xmath159 for metal islands .",
    "we have used the rates for the @xmath135 transition since the ratio would be smaller for the @xmath118 transition .",
    "for @xmath160 the latter process dominates and we have @xmath161 for the parameter values corresponding to the plots in fig .  3 of the main text , with @xmath162 ,",
    "these ratios are smaller than 10% , and therefore we conclude that cotunneling effects are negligible for the proposed device .",

    "<S> the coupling between the dots is purely capacitive so that there is no electron transport through the system . </S>",

    "<S> the time - reversed cycle carries heat in the other direction , and the total current is the sum of these two contributions . when the temperatures are reversed , electrons from the right reservoir , now at the low temperature @xmath6 , are unable to tunnel into the adjoining dot because the available thermal energy is much smaller than the required energies @xmath11 </S>",

    "<S> we have @xmath49 , giving the dependence of forward current on the energies @xmath50 as @xmath51 , and the rectification ratio as @xmath52 we see that @xmath53 should be large for efficient rectification while @xmath54 and @xmath55 should not be much above unity for a large forward current . </S>",
    "<S> also , the difference in the temperatures should preferably be in the range @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> since by definition @xmath18 is the ground state , both energies @xmath50 must be positive , and thus the optimal value of @xmath57 is zero . </S>",
    "<S> the energy @xmath58 can then be chosen to achieve the desired balance between forward current and diode efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction energy @xmath24 has only a small effect on rectification but the forward current depends on it strongly . when @xmath59 , the bose functions in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ j ] ) suppress the current exponentially , while in the limit @xmath60 the bose functions in eq .  ( [ a1 ] ) give a similar suppression . </S>",
    "<S> thus the optimal value of @xmath24 is of the order of @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> when considering the other operating regime , @xmath61 , we can restrict attention to the interval @xmath62 since a large @xmath63 would push the @xmath21 state below the ground state , while the above approximations for positive @xmath24 are actually valid for @xmath64 and therefore the ( uninteresting ) case of @xmath65 is contained in the previous discussion . </S>",
    "<S> now we can approximate @xmath66 while the three other fermi factors in @xmath41 are taken as exponentials . </S>",
    "<S> then the current depends on the denominator of @xmath41 as @xmath67 , and the rectification ratio is @xmath68 here @xmath63 has replaced @xmath57 in both expressions and therefore the device operation is almost independent of @xmath57 in this regime . </S>",

    "<S> we see that both positive and negative @xmath24 can produce similar levels of rectification but the forward current is larger for @xmath61 and therefore we concentrate on that regime . to have an efficient diode with @xmath87 , we see that unless a temperature bias of @xmath88 is available , the forward current can not be larger than about @xmath89 , where @xmath70 for quantum dots and @xmath90 for metal islands . on the other hand , if a current level of @xmath91 is sufficient , considerable rectification takes place already for @xmath92 .    </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the above analysis requires that the dots are not coupled too strongly to the leads . </S>",
    "<S> since we require that only the lowest four levels are accessible , the tunneling rates should be smaller than the energies of the neglected higher - lying states . </S>",
    "<S> the energy scale for the forbidden transitions is set by @xmath58 and thus we must have @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> this coincides with the requirement that the junction conductances must be well below the conductance quantum . on the other hand , coupling strength </S>",
    "<S> must also be limited to prevent leakage currents due to cotunneling effects . as already discussed </S>",
    "<S> , the suppression of current under reverse bias is due to the fact that the low - energy particles are unable to tunnel into the right dot . </S>",
    "<S> this blockade can be lifted by coherent two - electron processes where particles tunnel through both junctions simultaneously and most of the required energy is contributed by the left reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> there are two such cotunneling processes : if the system is initially in the @xmath18 state , particles tunnel into both dots and the final state is @xmath21 ; the other possible process leads from @xmath19 to @xmath20 . in the supplementary material@xcite we present a detailed calculation of these processes and arrive at the conclusion that they can be neglected when </S>",
    "<S> @xmath94 is bounded as above .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider how to actually realize the required energy level structure in a double - dot setup . </S>",
    "<S> for a metallic island , the tunneling energy @xmath8 is simply the difference of electrostatic charging energies of the initial and final states , for the quantum dot system one must also add the bare energy of the discrete single - particle level , @xmath37 . using the notation of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) , the charging energy for dots with charges @xmath95 and @xmath96 is @xmath97 with interaction constants @xmath98 and gate charges @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the level structure is controlled by two gate charges which in turn depend on three voltages , and therefore in a practical implementation one of the voltages can be discarded . </S>",
    "<S> if in the ground state @xmath18 the dots have charges @xmath100 and @xmath101 , then in the excited dots the charges are @xmath102 and @xmath103 , where the @xmath104 are @xmath105 or @xmath106 depending on whether the added excitation is an electron or a hole . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ech ] ) we then see that the magnitude of @xmath24 is determined by the capacitances as @xmath107 $ ] while the energies @xmath57 and @xmath58 as well as the sign of @xmath24 can be chosen with the gate charges . </S>",
    "<S> the energies @xmath50 are @xmath108 where the single - particle levels @xmath37 vanish for metallic islands . </S>",
    "<S> if the truncation of the system to the four lowest charge states is to be valid , all higher states must have an energy much above all @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> of course the levels @xmath8 must themselves have the structure discussed above . figure [ fig3](c ) </S>",
    "<S> shows two concrete examples of how to obtain appropriate level diagrams based on the above considerations </S>",
    "<S> .    experimental demonstration of the diode effect must take place at around 1 k or below . </S>",
    "<S> first , the requirement of large absolute bias , @xmath109 , can only be attained at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> second , since the device is based on coulomb blockade physics , the charging energies attainable in mesoscopic structures set the maximum operating temperature to about 1 k. third , in order to observe the thermal current through the diode , heat transport by phonons must be suppressed , and this generally takes place at sub - kelvin temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in a realistic setup we could have @xmath110  mk , @xmath111  mk , and @xmath112 , giving @xmath113  fw . </S>",
    "<S> referring to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , we see that it is then possible to have a forward current of the order of 1  fw with the reverse current being a few percent of this value . </S>",
    "<S> the forward current is large enough to be measured with state - of - the - art thermometry . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in summary , we propose a new device , a single - electron heat diode , which can be realized by a double - dot system connecting two electronic reservoirs at different temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the device and required operation scheme are routinely realized with currently existing technology . </S>",
    "<S> we explored the rectification performance of the device in detail and showed that with experimentally measurable current levels it is possible to have a rectification ratio well above 10 , even up to about 100 , making the present device the first concrete proposal for an efficient heat diode .    </S>",
