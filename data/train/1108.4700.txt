    "agn come in a variety of flavors and are found to have a range in bolometric luminosity from as low as @xmath15 ^-1 erg s@xmath7  to beyond @xmath16 ^-1 erg s@xmath7 , and accordingly , have a large range in their central black hole mass ( m@xmath13 ) from around @xmath17 m _",
    "m@xmath2  up to several @xmath18 m _ m@xmath2 . for about 20 years",
    "the method which has yielded the most robust determinations of m@xmath13 in agn , over a range in luminosity and m@xmath13 , is reverberation mapping ( rm ) .",
    "the rm technique allows determination of the time - lag ( @xmath3 ) between a change in continuum emission from an accretion disk and the delayed response due to light travel time of line emission from high velocity clouds in a distant broad - line region ( blr ) .",
    "combining measurements of the velocity range ( @xmath19 ) from an emission line width originating in the blr and the distance of the blr from the bh ( r@xmath4  @xmath20 , where c is the speed of light ) gives the virial mass within the blr .",
    "since the bh dominates the mass inside the blr , m@xmath21v@xmath22r@xmath4@xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a scaling factor that depends on the geometry , kinematics and orientation of the blr and @xmath25 is the gravitational constant ( for a full review see * ? ? ?",
    "assuming an isotropic blr circular velocity field and that the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) reflects two times the typical blr velocity yields @xmath26 0.75 @xcite .",
    "the most appropriate value of @xmath24 to use depends on the method used to find @xmath27v and reported values vary from 0.5 up to 5.5 depending on the fwhm of the line and the fwhm/@xmath28 ratio .",
    "define 2 populations based on the fwhm/@xmath28 ratio being below and above 2.35 ( the intrinsic ratio when fitting lines with a gaussian ) and estimate @xmath24 for each population to be 1.5 and 0.5 respectively",
    ". therefore a reasonable @xmath24 factor to use when measuring a line width measured from the fwhm of a gaussian fit is 0.75 .",
    "when r@xmath4 is in light days and @xmath27v measured by the fwhm in 1000 ^-1 kms@xmath7 , the bh mass in solar masses is :    @xmath29    when the rm determined r@xmath4  is plotted against the agn continuum luminosity a general trend is revealed where r@xmath4  @xmath30 l@xmath31 , the so called radius@xmath8luminosity ( r@xmath4@xmath8l ) power - law relation .",
    "an important caveat of the r@xmath4@xmath8l relation is the difficulty to accurately determine the contribution from the inner region of the host galaxy to the luminosity of the agn .",
    "@xcite show , using high resolution hubble space telescope ( hst ) images , that an accurate determination of the agn luminosity with respect to the host galaxy luminosity can change the slope ( @xmath32 ) of this relation significantly .",
    "a physical consequence of this relation is that for agns with very high luminosities , @xmath3 can be very large , on the order of several to tens of years .",
    "since the rm technique requires a high degree of accuracy in the calibration of spectra over an extended period of time for the most luminous agns , only a few of the highest luminosity , and therefore the highest mass agns have been attempted with rm @xcite . on the other hand , for agns with the lowest luminosity",
    ", @xmath3 can be quite short , on the order of a few hours to a few days .",
    "again , in terms of observations rm turns out to be difficult .",
    "if @xmath3 is on the order of hours , then semi - weekly observations will not resolve the time lag .",
    "the largest group of agns with m@xmath13 determined using rm is the nearby seyfert galaxies @xcite and several pg quasars @xcite who have @xmath3 on the order of a few to several hundreds of days and @xmath33 m@xmath34 m _ m@xmath2@xmath35 .",
    "agns with m@xmath1 m _",
    "m@xmath2  will have small @xmath3 , on the order of hours to days , and slower bulk motion of clouds in the blr as determined by the width of the broad lines .",
    "for example if @xmath36 days then @xmath37 ^-1 kms@xmath7  for m@xmath1 m _ m@xmath2  . only a very few agn meeting these criteria have had m@xmath13 robustly determined using rm .",
    "the agn in ngc 4395 is one such object whose m@xmath38 m _",

    "@xcite tenuously measure a ground based balmer line time lag for ngc 4395 that is consistent with the hst measurement .",
    "ngc 4395 is notorious in that it does not have a classic bulge and therefore does not follow the m@xmath39 relation .",

    "m@xmath2  for ngc 4051 raising the initial estimate but still within the low mass regime .",
    "low mass agns like ngc 4395 and ngc 4051 are useful for constraining evolutionary models since they may challenge in different ways the current coevolution paradigm @xcite .",
    "the robust rm measurements from the moderate luminosity agns and the scaling relations derived from it , like the r@xmath4@xmath8l relation , can be directly applied to single spectra to determine m@xmath13 for large samples of agns .",
    "for this so called ` single epoch ' method , m@xmath13 can be calculated using only 2 measurements , the @xmath19 of an emission line and the continuum luminosity . for lower redshift samples @xmath19 is usually found using the h@xmath9 line and the luminosity is measured at 5100   ( @xmath5l@xmath42 ) . for a review of this method and a comparison with rm measurements see @xcite , where it is shown that for the sufficiently high s / n spectra , the errors associated with single epoch measurements are on the order of 0.1 dex ( see also * ? ? ? * who estimate errors in m@xmath13 from optical and uv scaling relations to be a factor of 4 ) .",
    "this method has been increasingly employed in studies of agns due to the public availability of large samples of high quality spectra from surveys like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "since the slope of the power - law for the r@xmath4@xmath8l relation has not been robustly checked at the lowest luminosities , applying the single epoch method to large samples of agn is an easy way to find low mass candidates for follow - up studies using rm .",
    "the sample of @xcite employs this method to identify 19 candidate agns from the sdss with m@xmath1 m _ m@xmath2 . from this sample",
    "we take sdss j114008.71 + 030711.4 ( hereafter gh08 ) for a follow - up reverberation mapping campaign in an attempt to constrain the properties of agns hosting the lowest mass bhs .",
    "gh08 has a redshift z @xmath43 , which is actually the median of the entire sample .",
    "the sdss images show a resolved spiral galaxy with a moderately luminous agn .",
    "the sdss spectrum of gh08 has fairly narrow broad lines typical of narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) type agn , which are typically thought to have lower m@xmath13 but are accreting at close to the eddington limit ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while line ratios as measured from the sdss spectrum would place gh08 in the hii region of the bpt diagram ( see for example *",
    "* ) , there are several detections of an x - ray point source in both rosat and _ chandra _ @xcite at the agn location .",
    "hst images presented in @xcite reveal gh08 to have a resolved disk component with spiral arms and an elongated bar .",
    "the surface brightness as a function of radius is fit with a three component model ( disk , bar and an agn ) and the agn luminosity after deconvolution from the host is estimated to be @xmath5l@xmath42 @xmath44 ^-1 erg s@xmath7  . using the r@xmath4@xmath8l relation from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their equation 2 ) and the agn luminosity estimated from the hst images , we expect gh08 to have r@xmath4  @xmath45 8.7 days .    in section 2",

    "we assume the cosmology used by @xcite ( h@xmath46 h @xmath47 ^-1mpc^-1 kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) to compare with their results .",
    "the spectral data for gh08 were taken using the 9.2-m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) at mcdonald observatory from december 7 , 2009 to june 3 , 2010 with a total of 35 observations over a period of 178 days .",
    "the average time between observations is 6.1 days with a median of 5.9 .",
    "there are 5 instances where the time between useful observations is less than 3 days .",
    "all observations were taken using the low resolution spectrograph ( lrs ) with the g2 grism which has a resolving power of r @xmath50 1300 and covers a wavelength region from 4300 @xmath8 7300  .",
    "of these 35 observations , 5 had very low signal to noise ( s / n @xmath51 2 ) due to bad observing conditions and are not used in the time series analysis .",
    "all observations have an exposure time of 25 min ( providing 30 spectra each with a s / n @xmath523 ) .",
    "a fixed slit width of 2@xmath53 was used for each observation , but the position angle of the slit varies randomly from one observation to the next .",
    "a fixed slit position was requested for these queue observations but not obtained .",
    "the errors associated with a changing position angle will be discussed in detail below .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the standard iraf routines with the appropriate parameters set for the het lrs instrument .",
    "we use an extraction window of 2.5@xmath53 to maximize the s / n while minimizing host contamination from scales larger than about 2 kpc .",
    "the spectra were initially flux calibrated using spectral standard stars taken nightly . on six nights",
    "no calibration star was observed , usually due to degrading weather conditions , and the standard star used for the flux calibration of gh08 on those nights was the one observed closest in time to that observation .",
    "wavelength calibration was done using a hgcdar and ne spectra taken nightly .    to obtain internal flux calibration between the spectra from different nights",
    ", the chi - square fitting routine of @xcite was employed . in this algorithm",
    "the assumption is made that the narrow line flux of the [ oiii]@xmath55007 line is constant , since the nlr is at a large enough distance that the changing continuum will not effect its line flux on these short time scales .",
    "each individual spectrum was then scaled so that the [ oiii]@xmath55007 line in each spectrum had the same integrated flux as the mean spectrum ( from averaging individual spectra ) so that calibrated h@xmath9 measurements could be made . in principle",
    ", this procedure should have been repeated using the narrow [ sii]@xmath546716,6731 lines to properly calibrate the h@xmath32 measurements , but the lines are severely blended and the s / n falls drastically just redward of h@xmath32 so this was not feasible .",
    "therefore , the results based on the h@xmath32 line are not as reliable as those for h@xmath9 .",
    "other lines originating in the blr like hei@xmath55876 and heii@xmath54868 are not strong enough ( or absent ) given the s / n to make reliable measurements .",
    "the rest frame mean spectrum is shown in the top panel of figure 1 and was obtained using the highest s / n spectra throughout the run .",
    "the most notable features in the mean spectrum are the strong balmer lines , the hei@xmath55876 line , the [ oiii]@xmath54959,5007 doublet and feii lines flanking h@xmath9 . in the mean spectrum we measure the integrated flux of the [ oiii]@xmath55007 line using an extraction region of 80   ( rest frame ) about the line centroid and find f@xmath55 1.67 @xmath56 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 1 shows the rest frame rms spectrum of gh08 after the scaling procedure was completed .",
    "the [ oiii ] doublet disappears as expected and the residual in the h@xmath9 line is the reverberation signal that is to be measured .",
    "the strong residuals in the h@xmath32 , [ nii]@xmath546548,6584 , and [ sii ] lines are due to the poorer flux calibration in the red part of the spectrum mentioned above .",
    "the top panel in figure 2 shows the light curves for the continuum at 5100   ( rest frame ) . to measure the continuum we take a 140   wide window centered at 5100  .",
    "this window is just redward of the [ oiii]@xmath55007 line and just blueward of the feii lines that start at @xmath575200   ( rest frame ) .",
    "the light curves of the integrated line flux for h@xmath32 and h@xmath9 are shown in the two bottom panels .",
    "the measured fluxes for the continuum and balmer lines are listed in table 1 .",
    "the light curve statistics are presented in table 2 .",
    "the three light curves all have a similar global shape , where the variations in the lines are very similar to the variations in the continuum .",
    "they are however different enough from each other that we have confidence that we are not just sampling noise in the seeing conditions or instrument .",
    "there is roughly a factor of 2.3 overall change in the h@xmath9 and h@xmath32 flux , and nearly a factor of 2 change for the continuum flux ( before subtraction of the constant contribution from the host ) as shown by r@xmath58 in table 2 .",
    "a possible source of contamination we consider , due to the observing procedure used , is that the position angle of the slit was not constant throughout the observations .",
    "this contamination can manifest as additional narrow line flux from extended regions when more of the host galaxy is in the slit , thereby changing the relative flux scaling obtained during the inter calibration procedure . using images of the slit position with respect to the host galaxy orientation",
    ", we have checked that measured changes in flux are not correlated with the slit position angle ( thus having more or less of the host galaxy in the slit ) at different times throughout the observing run .",
    "for the time series analysis we use two independent methods to cross - correlate the continuum and line light curves .",
    "the first method is the interpolated cross - correlation function ( iccf ) of @xcite and @xcite , as implemented by @xcite ; see also the review by @xcite .",
    "the second method is the _",
    "z_-transformed discrete correlation function ( zdcf ) of @xcite which is an improvement on the discrete correlation function ( dcf ; * ? ? ?",
    "the zdcf applies fisher s _ z _ transformation to the correlation coefficients , and uses equal population bins rather than the equal time bins used in the dcf . in figure 3",
    "we show the iccf and zdcf for both the h@xmath32 and h@xmath9 lines .",
    "the value of the iccf coefficient for h@xmath9 at the central peak is a modest 0.5 and with a time lag of @xmath572 days , with an error of @xmath04 and @xmath59 days ( observed frame ) .",
    "the errors in the time lag determination are estimated using the model - independent flux randomization / random subset selection ( fr / rss ) monte carlo method ( for more details see * ? ? ?",
    "our measured value of 2 days is consistent with zero time lag within the given errors , meaning that we need finer time sampling to truly resolve the reverberation signal , but our measurements constitute an upper limit to the time lag .",
    "the time lag of zero for h@xmath32 could constitute a true lower limit or be spurious due to the poor flux calibration as discussed above .    in figure 4",
    "we show the velocity profiles of h@xmath32 and h@xmath9 for the mean spectra along with the gaussian line fits used to measure the fwhm . in order to constrain the width of the narrow lines we take the [ oiii]@xmath55007 line as a template and a gaussian fit",
    "gives a fwhm of 519 ^-1 kms@xmath7  ( the effect of instrumental broadening on the line widths and uncertainties is small ) . comparing this to a fwhm of 297 ^-1 kms@xmath7  as determined by @xcite shows that we are only just resolving the narrow lines . in order to constrain the contribution of the narrow balmer lines to the total line profiles we first assume that the [ oiii]/h@xmath9 flux ratio should be at least 3 based on emission line diagnostics for the classification of type 2 agn as in @xcite .",
    "further , the contribution of the narrow h@xmath32 component should be roughly 3 times that in the limit of case b recombination .",
    "for h@xmath32 ( top panel ) we fit 3 narrow line components and one broad .",
    "all 3 narrow lines are constrained to have the same line widths as [ oiii ] .",
    "the narrow [ nii ] lines are forced to have a flux ratio of 2.96 and the centroids of each line are fixed to the rest frame wavelengths of @xmath546548,6584 .",
    "the fit falls below the line profile near the peak .",
    "this is due to the fact that a simple gaussian function is not quite adequate .",
    "the broad component fit should be taller to compensate , which would decrease the fwhm .",
    "therefore the fwhm of 737 @xmath10 155 ^-1 kms@xmath7  we measure for h@xmath32 can be thought of as an upper limit .",
    "the h@xmath9 line ( lower panel ) is fit with 2 gaussians , a narrow component whose width is modeled after the [ oiii ] line and one broad component .",
    "again the fit falls below the line profile near the peak .",
    "we find an upper limit to the fwhm of h@xmath9 to be 777 @xmath10 110 ^-1 kms@xmath7 . for nls1@xmath8like agns a lorentzian profile can provide a better fit to the wings of the broad component as expected from the analysis of @xcite who show that the broad line shapes can vary from more lorentzian profiles at small fwhm ( @xmath60 ^-1 kms@xmath7 ) to more rectangular profiles at larger fwhm ( @xmath52 6000 ^-1 kms@xmath7 ) . for completeness ( but not shown in figure 4 ) we also fit both lines with a single lorentzian assuming that the narrow line contribution is negligible .",
    "because they are less constrained , the lorentzians fit better to the overall line profiles . in table 3",
    "we show the values for each line as measured from the fits as well as the values measured by @xcite .",
    "for the single lorentzian fits we find better agreement with original measurements of @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath9 line has larger measured fwhm than h@xmath32 in all cases .",
    "the fwhm of both the h@xmath9 and h@xmath32 lines are always larger in the mean spectrum than in the rms spectrum .",
    "this is not surprising given the results of who show that the h@xmath9 line widths are usually 20% broader in the mean spectrum compared to the rms spectrum .",
    "we can attribute the overly large widths measured to the fact that the lines are just resolved . therefore , since the true line profiles are not expected to be only purely gaussian or lorentzian , when estimating the upper limit to m@xmath13 we use an h@xmath9 fwhm of 703 @xmath10 110 ^-1 kms@xmath7  which is the average of our two h@xmath9 measurements .    in order to quantify the contribution of the host galaxy to the agn luminosity we use the analysis by",
    "they used hst / acs images in two filters ( b band @xmath8 f435w and i band @xmath8 f814w ) to decompose the observed intensity distribution of all the images of the @xcite sample into a combination of components , which includes a central unresolved source and some combination of a possible disk , bulge , and a bar . in the case of gh08",
    "they do not fit for a bulge , possibly due to the contrast with the strong bar .",
    "however , the presence of a small bulge can not be ruled out from a visual inspection of the images .",
    "@xcite plot in their figure 1 the contributions of the agn , the bar , and the disk components as a function of radius , as well as the total surface brightness in the i band and the b@xmath8i color .",
    "we use these components to estimate the agn contribution to the total flux within a circular aperture of radius 2@xmath53 by integration over the surface brightness profiles plotted for the different components of gh08 .",
    "we find that in the i band the agn contribution is about 20% of the total flux and in the b band it is about 50% of the total flux .",
    "using the gh08 agn luminosity given in @xcite and the hst images analysis we described above , we find the galaxy contribution to the luminosity in the central 2@xmath53 of gh08 to be @xmath5l@xmath61 ^-1 erg s@xmath7(f@xmath62 ^-2s^-1^-1 erg@xmath63s@xmath7@xmath7 ) . subtracting this contribution from the total luminosity we measure in this study",
    ", we estimate the agn luminosity at 5100   to be about @xmath5l@xmath64 ^-1 erg s@xmath7(f@xmath65 ^-2s^-1^-1 erg@xmath63s@xmath7@xmath7 ) .",
    "we also used the sdss images of gh08 to estimate the galaxy contribution .",
    "we used the iraf isophot package to fit ellipses to the sdss images of the object and linearly extrapolate the radial profile of the elliptical isophotes intensities in the outer 2@xmath665@xmath53 of the image to the inner 2@xmath53 ( same as used above with the hst data ) .",
    "the ratio of counts of the measured profile inside 2@xmath53 to the extrapolation from outside 2@xmath53 is taken as a measure of the agn fraction with respect to the host .",
    "we find the agn to be 46% and 36% of the total luminosity in the sdss @xmath67 and @xmath68 bands respectively , and we take the average of these two , 41% , as the agn fraction .",
    "we note that the agn fraction may be closer to 46% since the continuum region at 5100   is close to the red side of the sdss @xmath67 band . from this extrapolation method",

    "is even more outlying .",
