    "a recent idea on possible application of topological superconductors to quantum information processing has attracted both theoretical and experimental interest @xcite . according to this idea , a quantum information unit , qubit , can be formed and propagated by means of majorana mode ( see , for e.g. , ref . ) , localized at the end of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain hosting a topological superconductor @xcite .",
    "recent investigations suggest several detection mechanisms of such a majorana mode @xcite such as an existence of a central peak in the tunneling current through a topological superconductor ( s)- normal metal ( n)junction and fractional period of the josephson current in s - n - s junctions .",
    "most recently experimental systems involving 1d semiconductor wire has been shown to host such modes ; the mechanism of the appearance of such modes arise from the combination of strong soi , proximity - induced superconducting gap , chemical potential and applied zeeman field in these wires @xcite .",
    "two majorana modes in the josephson junction , formed between two topological insulator edges or one - dimensional superconducting nanowires separated by barrier , hybridize resulting in splitting of the zero energy modes .",
    "this splitting energy depends not only on the phase difference of the two superconductors but also on the relative direction of the spin polarization at the two side of the junction .",
    "the oscillations of a josephson current between two such superconductors separated by insulator or metal as a function of their phase difference , with @xmath9 periodicity instead of a conventional @xmath10 periodicity due to hybridization of majorana states was predicted by kitaev @xcite for a idealized model of an 1d spinless p - wave superconductor . following this , kwon _",
    "et al_. @xcite proposed that the similar effect can be observed between quasi-1d or 2d unconventional superconducting tunnel barrier junctions where the superconductors are separated by an insulating region , usually modeled by a delta function potential barrier .",
    "these systems did not have soi or zeeman field ; majorana - like modes appeared in such systems from the unconventional nature of the pairing potential .",
    "further it was realized in ref .",
    "that a signature of the fractional josephson effect constitutes in having a halved josephson frequency , @xmath11 , in the presence of a dc voltage @xmath12 applied across the junction .",
    "these effects have been interpreted in terms of the josephson current being carried by electrons rather than cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "further , it was shown that a fractional josephson effect may be realized at topological insulator edge @xcite .",
    "this prediction has later been extended to different systems @xcite .",
    "recent activities have established that a topological insulator with proximity - induced coupling to a s - wave superconductor exhibits a superconductivity - magnetism duality @xcite , revealing the fractional periodicity not only with superconducting phase difference but also with the orientation of zeeman magnetic field . in this case",
    ", the magnetic field on one side of the junction rotates in the plane normal to the direction of an effective magnetic field of the soi ; consequently , the majorana - mediated josephson current reverses sign after @xmath13 rotation of the magnetic field orientation and reveals an unconventional @xmath9 periodic magneto - josephson oscillation in response to variation of the magnetic field orientation in a topological insulator edge @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a dissipationless fractional josephson effect mediated by with @xmath14 periodicity has been also predicted @xcite at the edge of a quantum spin hall insulator .",
    "the josephson effect in consisting of topological superconducting ( s ) and normal ( n ) regions , has been reported in @xcite .",
    "these works also reveal a signature of majorana bound states located at s - n edges , producing a fractional josephson current with @xmath9 periodicity @xcite .",
    "these previous works in the field have pointed out the importance of the fractional josephson and the magneto - josephson effect in 1d superconducting junctions or atop the surface of a topological insulator .",
    "however , the role of spin - orbit coupling and the external magnetic field behind these effects has not been systematically investigated in these earlier works .",
    "such a systematic study is the main aim of the present work . to this end",
    ", we study the josephson effect between two 1d nanowires oriented along @xmath0 with proximity induced @xmath1-wave superconducting pairing and separated by a narrow dielectric with a rashba spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) of strength @xmath2 and zeeman fields ( @xmath3 along @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the @xmath6 plane ) . a schematic representation of the proposed setup is shown in fig .  [ josephson ] .",
    "the main results of our study are as follows .",
    "first , we develop a general method for computing the andreev bound states energy in these junctions .",
    "such a method constitutes a generalization of the method of ref .   to junctions with zeeman magnetic fields and spin - orbit coupling .",
    "second , using this method , we obtain analytical expressions for the energy of the andreev bound states in several asymptotic cases and discuss their implication on the josephson current .",
    "for example , we find that in the absence of the magnetic fields the energy gap between these bound states decreases with increasing rashba soi constant leading eventually to level touching while in the absence of rashba soi , they display oscillatory behavior with orientational angle of @xmath15 .",
    "third , we present analytic expressions for the dc josephson current charting out their dependence on both @xmath5 and @xmath3 and the soi interaction strength .",
    "fourth , we demonstrate the existence of finite spin - josephson current in these junctions in the presence of external magnetic fields and provide analytic expressions for its dependence on @xmath2 , @xmath7 and @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we study the ac josephson effect in the presence of the soi ( for @xmath8 ) and an external radiation and show that the width of the resulting shapiro steps in such a system can be tuned by varying @xmath2 .",
    "we discuss experiments which can test our theoretical results .",

    "<S> we calculate the josephson current between two one - dimensional ( 1d ) nanowires oriented along @xmath0 with proximity induced @xmath1-wave superconducting pairing and separated by a narrow dielectric barrier in the presence of both rashba spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) characterized by strength @xmath2 and zeeman fields ( @xmath3 along @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the @xmath6 plane ) . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate a general method for computing the andreev bound states energy which allows us to obtain analytical expressions for the energy of these states in several asymptotic cases . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the absence of the magnetic fields the energy gap between the andreev bound states decreases with increasing rashba soi constant leading eventually to touching of the levels . in the absence of rashba soi , the andreev bound states depend on the magnetic fields and display oscillatory behavior with orientational angle of b leading to magneto - josephson effect . </S>",
    "<S> we also present analytic expressions for the dc josephson current charting out their dependence on @xmath5 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the existence of finite spin - josephson current in these junctions in the presence of external magnetic fields and provide analytic expressions for its dependence on @xmath2 , @xmath7 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we study the ac josephson effect in the presence of the soi ( for @xmath8 ) and an external radiation and show that the width of the resulting shapiro steps in such a system can be tuned by varying @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss experiments which can test our theoretical results . </S>"
