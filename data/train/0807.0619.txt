    "the main result of this paper ( theorem [ main ] ) says that the special fiber of a galois branched cover of the open @xmath0-adic disc is determined by characteristic zero fibers .",
    "the motivation for such a theorem comes from the _ global lifting problem for galois covers of curves _ : if @xmath1 is a finite group , @xmath2 is an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is a finite @xmath1-galois branched cover of smooth projective @xmath2-curves , does there exist a lifting of @xmath5 to a @xmath1-galois branched cover of smooth projective @xmath6-curves , where @xmath6 is a discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristic with residue field @xmath2 ?",
    "this problem has been much studied ; see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    as a brief survey of the subject , we mention the following results :    * ( grothendieck , @xcite ) if @xmath5 is at most tamely ramified , then a lifting exists over @xmath6 , where @xmath6 is any complete dvr with residue field @xmath2 . moreover , the lifting is unique once we fix a lifting of @xmath7 and the branch locus of @xmath5 .",
    "* not all wildly ramified covers are liftable : there exist curves of genus @xmath8 in positive characteristic whose automorphism groups are too large to be automorphism groups of genus @xmath9 curves in characteristic zero , by the hurwitz genus bounds",
    ". if @xmath10 is such a curve , it is then clear that @xmath11 is not liftable to mixed characteristic .",
    "* there are examples of non - liftable @xmath0-elementary abelian covers .",
    "see @xcite for an example with @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "* oort , sekiguchi , and suwa showed in @xcite that cyclic covers lift if @xmath0 divides @xmath14 at most once .",
    "their method was global in nature , involving a group scheme degeneration of kummer theory to artin - schreier theory .",
    "* using local methods ( see below ) , green and matignon proved in @xcite that cyclic covers lift if @xmath0 divides @xmath14 at most twice . * pagot has shown in @xcite that klein - four covers always lift .",
    "* @xmath15-covers are liftable by @xcite , where the method of differential data is used .",
    "* green has shown in @xcite that the @xmath16-cyclic covers that occur as automorphisms of lubin - tate formal groups are liftable .",
    "the guiding conjecture in the subject was provided by f. oort ( @xcite , i.7 ) who suggested the    cyclic covers always lift .    in section 5",
    ", we derive an arithmetic reformulation of a stronger form of this conjecture , which specifies the ring @xmath6 over which the lifting should occur :     if @xmath4 is cyclic of order @xmath17 with @xmath18 , then @xmath5 lifts over @xmath19 $ ] , where @xmath20 denotes the witt vectors of @xmath2 .",
    "a major breakthrough in the subject came when green and matignon discovered that the obstructions to lifting are not global in nature , but rather local . indeed , using either rigid patching @xcite or deformation theory @xcite , the global lifting problem reduces to a local one , due to the    _",

    "we mean that @xmath34 is an integral domain ( where @xmath35 is a uniformizer for @xmath6 ) , and the fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 are isomorphic as @xmath1-galois extensions of @xmath38 . in particular , in the birational version of the local problem , we do not require @xmath39 to be smooth : in terms of geometry , this corresponds to allowing the curve @xmath10 to acquire singularities .    as mentioned above",
    ", the local lifting problem does not always have a positive solution . on the other hand ,",
    "garuti has shown in @xcite that the birational local lifting problem _ does _ always have a positive solution , so the birational problem is indeed weaker than the local lifting problem .",
    "it is clearly advantageous to work with laurent series fields rather than power series rings , however , and the following criterion for good reduction ensures that we may do so without sacrificing the smoothness of our liftings .    _",

    "roughly speaking , our result says that the special fiber of a galois cover of the open @xmath0-adic disc `` wants '' to be the field of norms of the characteristic zero fibers , and the degree to which this fails is the phenomenon of inseparability .",
    "our work can be regarded as a concrete investigation of the class field theory of the open @xmath0-adic disc , and our main result suggests that the local lifting problem would be answered by a grunwald - wang type theorem for the open disc , with control over the generic different .    in section 2 of this paper",

    "then there exists @xmath622 such that for @xmath623 we have @xmath624 .",
    "consequently , the canonical isomorphism @xmath625 preserves the ramification filtrations on these groups . in particular , the conductor of @xmath626 is equal to the conductor of @xmath627 for @xmath623 .",

    "it follows that the degree of the generic different is @xmath662 .    specializing the equation at @xmath663 yields @xmath664 and",
