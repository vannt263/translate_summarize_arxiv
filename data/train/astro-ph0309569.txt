    "@xcite have recently proposed an alternative to the cosmological constant model explaining the currently accelerating universe . in this model the standard friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) equation is modified by the presence of an additional term @xmath4 , namely @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hubble parameter , @xmath7 is the scale factor , @xmath8 is the energy density of matter and radiation , and @xmath9 is a positive constant . for simplicity",
    "it is assumed that , the density parameter for radiation matter @xmath10 .",
    "this proposal seems to be attractive because the expansion of the universe is accelerated automatically due to the presence of the additional term ( if we put @xmath11 then the standard frw equation is recovered ) .    because the cardassian model offers an alternative to the cosmological constant model , the agreement of this model with available observations of type ia supernovae ( sn ia )",
    "was immediately verified @xcite .",
    "some interesting results on observational constraints in the generalized cardassian model were also obtained from the statistical analysis of gravitational lensed quasars @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we use three sn ia data sets compiled by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to test both the original cardassian model and its extension with a curvature term .",
    "our results are inconsistent with @xcite s prediction of the low density universe .",
    "the noteworthy results from the joint analysis of sn ia data and cmbr were obtained by @xcite who also confirmed the prediction of low density universe , but their analysis was restricted to the case of @xmath12 . this case",
    "was also examined by @xcite who used the tonry sn ia data .",
    "however , such a choice of an interval for this parameter is not physically justified and both negative and positive values are admissible .",
    "we add a curvature term to the original cardassian model . then equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) assumes the following form @xmath13 it is useful to rewrite equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) in dimensionless variables @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 where energy density for the dust is assumed ( @xmath17 ) ( and hence @xmath18 from a conservation equation ) , @xmath19 is the matter density parameter ; @xmath20 is the density parameter for the fictitious noninteracting fluid which mimics term @xmath4 and yields additional density in the model .",
    "the subscript zero denotes a present value of model parameters .",
    "then @xmath21 for @xmath22 ( the present value of scale factor ) we obtain the following constraint @xmath23 for the fictitious cardassian fluid we obtain @xmath24 if @xmath18 . in this interpretation the negative value of @xmath1 is equivalent to the existence of phantom matter with supernegative presssure .",
    "let us note that in the analogous equation describing frw dynamics with dust and additional fictitious fluid with the equation of state @xmath24 presented in @xcite only case @xmath25 was considered .",
    "it is well known that various cosmic distance measures , for example the luminosity distance , depend sensitively both on the spatial geometry ( curvature ) and dynamics . therefore , luminosity depends on the present densities of the different components of matter content and its equation of state . for this reason ,",
    "the magnitude - redshift relation for distant objects is proposed as a potential test for cosmological models and plays an important role in determining cosmological parameters .",
    "let us consider an observer located at @xmath26 at the moment @xmath27 who receives light emitted at @xmath28 from a source of absolute luminosity @xmath29 located at the radial distance @xmath30 .",
    "it is known that the cosmological redshift @xmath31 of the source is related to @xmath32 and @xmath33 by the relation @xmath34 . if the apparent luminosity @xmath35 of the source measured by the observer is defined by @xmath36",
    "then the luminosity distance @xmath37 of the source is @xmath38    for historical reasons , the observed and absolute luminosities are defined in terms of k - corrected observed magnitudes and absolute magnitudes @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) @xcite . when written in terms of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , equation  ( [ eq:6 ] ) yields @xmath43\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the dimensionless luminosity distance while @xmath37 is in mpc .    the standard analysis yields the following relationship for the dimensionless luminosity distance @xmath46^{-1/2}dz ' \\right),\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and the density parameter for hypothetical curvature fluid is @xmath48 thus , for given @xmath49 , @xmath19 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , equations ( [ eq:8 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) give the predicted value of @xmath52 at a given @xmath31 .",
    "the goodness of fit is characterized by the parameter @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the measured value , @xmath55 is the value calculated in the model described above , @xmath56 is the measurement error , @xmath57 is the dispersion in the distance modulus due to peculiar velocities of galaxies .",
    "we assume that supernovae measurements come with uncorrelated gaussian errors and in this case the likelihood function @xmath58 can be determined from a chi - squared statistic @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "we have decided to test our model using the perlmutter samples of supernovae @xcite .",
    "we estimate the value of @xmath49 ( equation  ( [ eq:9 ] ) ) separately for the full sample of 60 supernovae ( sample a ) and for the sample of 54 supernovae ( sample c  in that sample we exclude 2 supernovae as outliers and 2 as likely reddened ones from the sample of 42 high redshift supernovae and 2 outliers from the sample of 18 low redshift supernovae ) .",
    "we obtain the value of @xmath60 for sample a , and @xmath61 for sample c. to test the model we calculate the best fit with minimum @xmath62 as well as estimate the model parameters using the likelihood method @xcite . for both statistical methods",
    "we take the parameter @xmath1 in the interval @xmath63 $ ] , @xmath19 in the interval @xmath64 $ ] , @xmath51 in the interval @xmath65 $ ] , while an interval for @xmath50 is obtained from equation  ( [ eq:5 ] ) .    first , we estimate best fitting parameters for the non - flat cardassian model and obtain @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 for sample a , and @xmath66 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 for sample c. this model is characterized with strong negative curvature , that is similar to the perlmutter results .",
    "let us note that such a high value of @xmath51 is in contradiction with cmb observations , which prefer the flat universe .",
    "when we assume that @xmath73 then we obtain the best - fitted flat cardassian model with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 for sample a , and @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 for sample c. the detailed values are in tables  [ tab:1 ] and  [ tab:2 ] .",
    ".results of the statistical analysis of the cardassian model obtained both for perlmutter sample a and c from the best fit with minimum @xmath62 ( denoted with bf ) and from the likelihood method ( denoted with l ) .",
    "the same analysis was repeated with fixed @xmath80 . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the detailed results of our analysis for the flat model , based on the likelihood method , are summarized in table  [ tab:8 ] . for sample",
    "ta we obtain that @xmath81 and @xmath82 on the confidence level @xmath83 for @xmath84 ; while @xmath85 and @xmath86 on the confidence level @xmath83 when we marginalize over @xmath49 .",
    "in turn for sample td we obtain that @xmath87 and @xmath88 on the confidence level @xmath83 for @xmath84 , while @xmath89 and @xmath90 on the confidence level @xmath83 when we marginalize over @xmath49 .    for the flat model with @xmath80",
    "we obtain for subsample ta @xmath91 with @xmath92 for @xmath84 and @xmath93 with @xmath94 when we marginalize over @xmath49 . for other subsamples results",
    "are very similar .",
    "all these results suggest that @xmath1 is negative and consequently @xmath19 is greater than @xmath2 .",
    "generally we find that results obtained with the tonry sample are the similar as obtained with the perlmutter sample apart from the non flat case where values of @xmath1 parameter are positive , because either positive and negative values are in the perlmutter samples .",
    "in the present paper we discussed the problem of universe acceleration in the cardassian model .",
    "our results are different from those obtained by @xcite who suggested the universe with very low matter density .",
    "our results indicate the high or normal ( @xmath95 ) matter density .",
    "this difference may come from not including the errors in redshifts and using a different variable by them . in our fitting procedure",
    "we use the more natural variable @xmath50 ( or @xmath19 ) instead of their parameter @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "two parameters @xmath19 and @xmath96 are related by the formula @xmath98 in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] relation  ( [ eq:14 ] ) for different @xmath1 is presented .",
    "we can observe that taking a constant step in @xmath96 it leads to varying steps in @xmath19 . in our method",
    "we have @xmath99 and we take the constant step of @xmath100 in @xmath19 . for the flat cardassian model both @xcite and we obtained negative values of @xmath1 with the best fit method .      assuming the curvature term @xmath51 in the cardassian model we obtained its statistical estimation to be close to zero . in this natural way we got that a nearly flat universe is preferred .",
    "moreover , in this case for perlmutter sample c the preferred value of @xmath19 is @xmath101 that is in agreement with cmbr and extragalactic data . while for sample a we got that a universe with higher matter content is preferred .",
    "let us note that @xcite obtained the high negative value of @xmath51 as the best fit , although zero value of @xmath51 is statistically admissible . to find the curvature they additionally used the data from cmbr and extragalactic astronomy .",
    "but in the cardassian model in natural way the nearly flat universe is favored .    if the flat universe is assumed , in the analysis of the cardassian universe with sample c we got low but positive values of @xmath1 and matter density higher than @xmath2 . for all other samples we obtained negative values of @xmath1",
    "( it would also indicate the phamtom fluid with super negative pressure ) . in turn ,",
    "when @xmath19 is fixed to be @xmath2 , then @xmath3 is favored .    in general , the results obtained using the perlmutter and knop samples are not significantly different .",
    "the main advantage of using the knop sample is the lower errors of estimated parameters in the model .",
    "the tonry sample also gave the results similar to the perlmutter sample .",
    "it can be noted that the tonry sample does not improve the estimation errors compared with the perlmutter sample .    from the statistical analysis we found that the perlmutter and cardassian models are indistinguishable .",
    "hence , using the philosophy of occam s razor the cardassian model should be rejected if we base on current sn ia data .",
    "however , the cardassian model has its own advantages and fits well to the present observational data . and till we have no more precise data we should wait before we reject this model ."
