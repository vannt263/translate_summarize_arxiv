    "the @xmath6 reactions are important methods for studying the properties of hyperon resonances . among of them",
    ", the reaction @xmath0 is particularly interesting , because both @xmath7 and @xmath4 are isospin singlet , there is no contributions from the @xmath8 resonances , and therefore , this reaction is especially suitable for studying the properties of @xmath4 resonances . even though the @xmath9 channel is a relatively clean channel for studying @xmath4 resonances , current knowledge on the couplings of @xmath4 resonances with the @xmath9 channel is still not satisfying . in particle data group(pdg ) book  @xcite , there is only one state , @xmath10 , which has well established decay branch to the @xmath9 channel .",
    "the couplings of other @xmath4 resonances with the @xmath9 channel are only very poorly known .",
    "this is possibly due to the weak couplings of other @xmath4 resonances with the @xmath11 channel .",
    "another possible reason is the limited early experimental data with very poor quality .    in 2001 ,",
    "some new experimental data with much better precision than before were reported by the crystal ball collaboration@xcite .",
    "these new data offer a better basis for investigating the reaction mechanism of @xmath0 and extracting the information about @xmath4 resonances in this reaction .",
    "within an effective lagrangian approach , we investigate the mechanism of @xmath0 reaction near threshold  @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath12channel @xmath13 exchange and @xmath14channel proton exchange as background contributions(as shown in fig .",
    "[ feynfig](a ) ) . in @xmath15channel , firstly we only include @xmath10 exchange , because it is the only @xmath16 state which has significant coupling to the @xmath9 channel .",
    "we set the coupling constants appearing in the amplitudes and the mass and width of @xmath10 as free parameters .",
    "we also include two parameters as the relative phase factors among amplitudes .",
    "then we fit these parameters to the data .",
    "it is found that although the total cross section data can be well described , the bowl structures shown in angular distributions can not be reproduced at all(see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "this result is not unexpected as we only include one @xmath15wave resonance in this fit .",
    "it seems we still need some higher partial wave contributions .",
    "next , we include a new @xmath1 resonance in the fit with setting the parameters of this resonance as free parameters . in this new fit , both total and differential",
    "cross section data can be well described .",
    "the best fitting results favor the @xmath1 resonance with mass @xmath17 mev and width @xmath3 mev , which is obviously not a known @xmath4 resonance listed in pdg . here",
    "it will be interesting to discuss the role of @xmath18 in this reaction .",
    "@xmath18 is a well established @xmath1 state and also lies near @xmath9 threshold .",
    "in fact , in the experimental paper@xcite the authors also noticed the higher partial wave contributions shown in the angular distributions , and they argued that these higher partial wave contributions may come from @xmath18 .",
    "however , the largest beam momentum of these new data is about 770 mev , which corresponds to invariant mass @xmath19 gev , the lower limit of the mass of @xmath18 suggested by pdg .",
    "therefore if these higher partial wave contributions are due to @xmath18 , one may expect that the bowl structure shown in the angular distributions should be more and more prominent with increasing energies .",
    "such an expectation is not supported by the data , so we do not think these higher partial wave contributions are caused by @xmath18 .    because there are no other experimental evidences or theoretical predictions for the existence of this narrow resonance , it will be important to find some other proofs to establish the existence of this new resonance .",
    "fortunately , there are some ways to verify our results .",
    "the first way is from the @xmath4 polarization data .",
    "in fact , besides the total and differential cross section data some @xmath4 polarization data are also reported by the crystal ball collaboration in the same paper  @xcite . because the quality of the @xmath4 polarization data is poor and the number of these data points is small , we did not include these data in the fit .",
    "however , after fixing the free parameters by fitting to the total and differential cross section data , it will be interesting and important to check our model predictions for the @xmath4 polarization . the predictions of our model for the @xmath4 polarization are shown in fig .",
    "[ pol ] . as can be seen from the figure , with large uncertainties of current data one can not get any decisive conclusions .",
    "however , it is shown that with or without the narrow @xmath1 resonance the models give distinct predictions for the @xmath4 polarization at @xmath20mev .",
    "thus if we have more accurate @xmath4 polarization data in the future , we will have more evidence for this narrow resonance .",
    "polarization with(black solid line ) and without(red dashed line ) including the narrow resonance . for details",
    "see ref.@xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]   polarization with(black solid line ) and without(red dashed line ) including the narrow resonance . for details",
    "see ref.@xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    another way is the measurements on the @xmath21 reaction . with the parameters fixed in the @xmath0 reaction",
    ", we can make some predictions for the observables of @xmath22 reaction based on meson exchange model(see fig .",
    "[ feynfig](b ) ) .    in a simplified model ,",
    "we ignore the initial and final state interactions and we only consider kaon exchange . the calculated results for the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath9 and the angular distribution of @xmath7 meson in center of mass frame are shown in fig .  [ ppbar ] .",
    "there are mainly two findings from these calculations .",
    "the first finding is that with or without the narrow @xmath1 resonance the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath9 system and the angular distribution of @xmath7 meson will show very different pattern .",
    "the second finding is that , compared to the small bump caused by the narrow resonance in the total cross sections of the @xmath0 reaction , the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath9 shows a sharp peak here .",
    "it indicates that the narrow @xmath23wave resonance s contribution is enhanced in this reaction .",
    "this enhancement is due to some simple kinematical reason .",
    "because the threshold momentum is much larger for the @xmath24 reaction than that for the @xmath25 reaction , the vertex function of @xmath26 vertex for @xmath23wave resonance(@xmath27 ) will be largely enhanced in the @xmath28 reaction compared to the @xmath29 reaction . for @xmath30wave resonance",
    ", there is no such enhancement .",
    "so the signal of the narrow @xmath23wave resonance is enhanced in the @xmath31 reaction , which makes this reaction a good place to look for the narrow resonance if it exists .",
    "reaction with(solid line ) and without(dotted line ) including the narrow resonance.,title=\"fig : \" ]   reaction with(solid line ) and without(dotted line ) including the narrow resonance.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the main conclusions of this work can be summarized as follows :    1 .   with including the @xmath18 , the higher partial wave contributions shown in angular distributions can not be explained .",
    "2 .   with including a narrow @xmath1 resonance(@xmath2mev , @xmath3mev )",
    ", we can describe the data well .",
    "remeasurements on the differential cross section and @xmath4 polarization data and measurements on the reaction @xmath32 may help .",
