    "<S> this universality class is different from the well known universality class of directed percolation ( see  @xcite , or for an overview  @xcite ) . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a modified clg model with a random neighbor interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this random neighbor interaction suppresses long range correlations and the model is expected to be characterized by the mean field scaling behavior . </S>",

    "<S> for instance close to the critical point , where the density of active sites is sufficiently low , the density - density correlation function displays an alternating behavior due to the repulsive interaction of the particles . </S>",
    "<S> but these correlations are short ranged and it is therefore possible to neglect them . </S>",

    "<S> if one of the new neighbors of the hopped particle is occupied by an inactive particle ( @xmath12 ) and the second neighbor is empty ( @xmath13 ) , the number of active sites is increased by one ( @xmath14 ) , and the corresponding probability is given by @xmath15 . </S>",

    "<S> this deviation , which decreases with increasing  @xmath59 , is caused by the neglection of correlations between neighboring sites . </S>",
    "<S> simulations reveal that these correlations exists but are of short range ( not shown ) . therefore , the critical value is shifted but the scaling behavior itself agrees with our analytical results , i.e. , the order parameter vanishes at the critical point continuously with an exponent @xmath49 .    additionally to the order parameter its fluctuations @xmath64 are measured in the simulations . here </S>",

    "<S> furthermore the values @xmath49 and @xmath66 were predicted within a field theoretical approach which is expected to represent the universality class of absorbing phase transitions with a conserved field  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> each active site can create @xmath67 active sites in the next generation with the probability @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the steady state condition corresponds to the condition that the average number of created active sites in the next generation is one which yields directly equation([eq : rho_a ] ) . </S>"
