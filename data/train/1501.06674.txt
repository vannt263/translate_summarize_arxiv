    "it follows that changes in the precise nature of the excitation dynamics do not necessarily result in changes to the functional behavior .",
    "two different excitation dynamics can still give rise to equivalent quantities of excitation causing irreversible electron loss ( reaching the rp2 state ) . as a result , to show that certain terms in an equation of motion are important to photosynthesis requires both that they change the excitation dynamics and that they increase ( or decrease ) the fraction of excitation that reaches rp2 , the latter being a measure of how much they influence the function of photosynthesis .",

    "the pure frster calculation is based on rates obtained from the overlaps between emission and absorption spectra of each pair of pigments ( i.e.  donor and acceptor pigments )  @xcite .",
    "this simple approximate method can give reasonable results in a regime where the coupling between donor and acceptor pigments is weak compared to the coupling to the vibrations .",

    "[ fig_zofe_transfer]a we do indeed see a significant deviation of the pure frster calculation ( dotted lines ) from the other simulations .",
    "furthermore , the transport efficiency ( population reaching rp2 within 1  ns ) calculated with pure frster is lower .    the observation that the mrgf and zofe calculations are in close agreement with each other , while the pure frster calculation gives a lower transport efficiency , supports the key role of exciton delocalization in excitation transport through psii .",
    "the dynamic effect is sometimes referred to as supertransfer , since it occurs when strongly coupled pigments allow an excitation to coherently delocalize within the donor domain , thereby enhancing the rate of transport by up to a factor equal to the number of pigments in the donor domain ( see e.g.  ref .",

    "these currents are calculated from the time - dependent density matrix using equations  ( [ total_current ] ) and  ( [ inter_protein_current ] ) .    from equation  ( [ total_current ] )",
    ", we know that the energy transfer from lhcii to cp43 and on to the rc is entirely through the coherence between the pigments , and the transfer to the rp states is entirely through the population .",
    "this is combined by figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer]b , where the solid lines are the total currents , and the dashed and dotted lines show the coherence and population contribution , respectively .",
    "we see that all currents between complexes are positive over the entire time range .",
    "that means that the net flow of energy is directed towards the rp2 state at all times and no temporary intercomplex backflow occurs . because of the high rate of transport between the rc and the rp1 state , in figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer]b the current from rc to rp1 almost completely follows the current from cp43 to the rc ; there is only a very small delay of the current to rp1 .",
    "that means the population is almost passed right through the rc to rp1 .",

    "however , particularly within complexes , there are a few pathways that transport a particularly large amount of excitation energy , identified in figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer_currents ] .",
    "remarkably , in figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer_currents ] we see that there are a number of relatively strong currents that run in a circular fashion , where energy is transported in a loop between pigments . for instance",

    "there is also one from 16 to 21 to 24 , and back to 16 .    in the reaction center",
    ", there is a strong circular current from 32 to 27 to 28 , and back to 32 .",
    "we also see in figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer_currents ] that in the reaction center overall the dominant net flow to the rp1 state is via pigment 30 and 32 .",
    "even though pigments 27 and 28 are part of the strong circular current , they do not appear to contribute significantly to the net transport to rp1 .",
    "there is even a net backflow from the rp1 state to the pigments 27 and 28 , which acts to decrease the efficiency of the transport .",
    "pigments 27 and 28 receive a small amount of population from cp43 pigments , but the backflow from rp1 to these two pigments is larger and therefore seems to outweigh their contribution to the transport to rp1 . in the light of these pathways",
    ", it appears that the efficient excitation energy transfer to and in the rc relies mainly on the two pigments 30 and 32 , and that therefore other reaction center pigments may rather be needed for their role in the electron transport ( described by the rp states in our model ) than for the excitation transfer . to test this hypothesis , we ran additional simulations where  except for the pigments 30 and 32  we decoupled all rc pigments from the rest of the pigments , inhibiting electronic excitation transfer to all rc pigments but 30 and 32 , while leaving the coupling to the rp states unmodified .",
    "we found the resulting efficiency of the energy transport to the rp2 state in this restricted model to be indeed the same as in the original model where the excitation transport to the other rc pigments was allowed .",
    "this shows that only the two pigments 30 and 32 may be needed for the excitation energy transport to the rp states , and the role of other rc pigments appears to be mainly in the electron transport ( described by the rp states ) .",
    "according to the population current description of equation  ( [ total_current ] ) , the _ imaginary component _ of coherence between pigments is responsible for the population currents through psii . in the ongoing discussion about the role of coherence in the energy transfer in biological systems , coherence and its contribution to the energy transfer",

    "gives the time - dependent electronic density matrix and therefore allows direct quantification of the coherences , the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix in the respective basis of interest .",

    "( sites 7 and 10 , which carry the initial excitation , belong to the same domain that consists of only these two sites . )    in the exciton basis , on the other hand , there is initial coherence at time zero , because the excitation localized on sites 7 and 10 is expressed through a coherent superposition of exciton states that each have part of their excitation on sites 7 and 10 , but are also delocalized over other sites , mainly sites of the lhcii antenna protein .",
    "in both site and domain - exciton basis , the amount of coherence rises initially , because the dipole - dipole interaction between the pigments drives the initially localized state towards a more delocalized state . during the transport dynamics , the total electronic coherence decreases due to interaction with the vibrations , and later due to the accumulation of population in the radical pair states .",
    "next , we look at the time - integrated coherences between the individual pigments and also separately at the imaginary and real parts of the coherence , because of their different role in the energy transfer . to this end , we time - integrate the absolute value of the imaginary and real parts of the elements of the density matrix in the site basis during the first 1 ns of its propagation ( at which point , as we have shown above , the majority of the excitation has been irreversibly trapped at rp2 ) . in figure",

    "so far , we have considered initially localized excitation of only two pigments in the lhcii , with initial coherence in the exciton basis but not in the site basis . now , we contrast this by considering an initial state that is a completely delocalized superposition of all exciton states of all three proteins .",
    "we choose this initial state to be an ( equally weighted ) _ incoherent _ superposition of all exciton states ",
    "i.e. , no initial coherence in the exciton basis .",
    "thus , we take an initial density matrix , where in the exciton basis all diagonal elements ( populations ) are @xmath108 ( @xmath109 is the number of sites ) , except for the population of the radical pair states and the ground state , which are zero , and with all off - diagonal elements ( coherences ) set to zero .",
    "since the exciton states are the eigenstates of the system hamiltonian , this state would persist in the course of purely unitary system time propagation .",
    "but the coupling to the vibrations , the coupling to the radical pair states , and the radiative and non - radiative decay to the ground state cause the initial state to evolve in a non - unitary manner , driving the excitation transport through psii .",
    "these dynamics lead to the creation of excitonic coherence in the course of time evolution , even though it is not present initially .",
    "the transport dynamics that result from this incoherent , delocalized initial state are summarized in figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer_initallexcincoher ] .    , but the initial state is an ( equally weighted ) incoherent superposition of all exciton states of all three proteins , lhcii , cp43 , and the rc . for comparison ,",
    "the dashed lines in figure  a show the zofe dynamics from figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer]a for the localized initial state.,title=\"fig : \" ] , but the initial state is an ( equally weighted ) incoherent superposition of all exciton states of all three proteins , lhcii , cp43 , and the rc . for comparison ,",

    "we see that for the delocalized initial state , the population dynamics of the pigments now look quite different .",
    "in particular , 40% of the initial excitation is in the cp43 protein and almost 20% is in the reaction center pigments . as a result ,",
    "60% excitation is spatially closer to the reaction center than in the previous simulation .",
    "this results in a much earlier rise in the rp1 population ( black line ) than seen in our previous simulation ( black , dashed line ) .",
    "some of this excitation , however , is initiated in higher energy states allowing for back - transfer from cp43 to lhcii as can be seen in figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer_initallexcincoher]b .",
    "the green curve , representing the flow of excitation from lhcii to cp43 is negative now for an initial period of time , showing that there is a flow of excitation from cp43 back to lhcii .",

    "figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer_currents_initallexcincoher ] shows the time - integrated population currents between the individual pigments for the delocalized initial state , and should be compared to figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer_currents ] for the localized initial state .    , but the initial state is an ( equally weighted ) incoherent superposition of all exciton states of all three proteins , lhcii , cp43 , and the rc . ]",
    "the currents inside lhcii and from lhcii to cp43 are smaller now than before .",
    "this is expected , since now only part of the initial population is in lhcii . aside from these changes",
    ", however , the overall pattern of the pathways is very similar to what we have seen for the localized initial state before .",
    "the currents have the same directions as before , and even their relative magnitudes seem very similar .",
    "this is a remarkable result , since we know in this initial condition , every pigment has an equal initial excitation . nevertheless , both the short - range ( intra - complex ) and long - range ( inter - complex ) energy transfer are very similar for both initial conditions .",
    "interestingly , this suggests that while there is not a single obligate pathway of excitation energy transport within psii  there is a select subset of psii pigments that are used to create an excitation transport network .",
    "this observation may allow future work to differentiate between pigments that are involved in long - range transport from those that are predominately only associated with absorbing light and then transferring excitation locally ( and hence showing little to no net flux in either of our initial conditions ) .    despite the changes in excitation transport dynamics ,",
    "the functional behavior of psii is invariant to the change in initial excitation . in particular , the overall transport of population to the radical pair state rp2 is almost identical for both initial excitation conditions , as can be seen in figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer_initallexcincoher]a .",
    "( we note that because of the logarithmic time axis , the earlier deviation between the rp1 populations for the different initial states appears to be much larger than the deviation between the rp2 populations at later times , but in fact these deviations are of comparable magnitude . )",
    "this shows that changing the initial state from the previously considered localized state to a delocalized state does not change the efficiency of the energy transport .",
    "the stability of the functional behavior with respect to changes in excitation energy dynamics can be explained by the separation of timescales between the excitation energy transport and the loss mechanisms .",
    "excitation is lost in psii on a timescale of @xmath110  ns through a combination of fluorescence and non - radiative decay .",
    "excitation transport , however , occurs on a @xmath111  ps timescale .",
    "if we approximate the excitation transport to the radical pair states by a single rate constant , then the overall behavior is described by a two - rate ( three - state ) model  one rate for excitation to drive charge separation and a second rate of excitation undergoing non - radiative or radiative decay . within this simplified model , the fraction of excitation that performs charge separation ( as opposed to non - radiative or radiative decay ) as time goes to infinity is given by @xmath112  the population reaching the rp2 state in the long - time limit  where @xmath113 is the rate of population transfer to the rp states and @xmath114 is the rate of loss through non - radiative and radiative decay .",
    "we will use the phrase long - time efficiency to refer to this quantity @xmath115 and differentiate it from our 1  ns measure of efficiency , i.e.  @xmath116 , used in the remainder of the paper . in figure",
    "[ fig_zofe_transfer_initallexcincoher]a we see that at 100  ps the total excitation left on the pigments amounts to a population of @xmath117 . inserting this value in @xmath118",
    ", we estimate the rate of excitation transport from the lhcii initial state ( dashed lines ) to the rp states as @xmath119 , which , using eq .",
    "( [ long_time_efficiency ] ) , gives a long - time efficiency of 97% . to substantially change this value",
    ", the rate of excitation transport to the rp states would need to slow enough to become comparable to the @xmath120 rate of excitation loss .",
    "for example , slowing the rate of transport to the rp states by a factor of 2 only decreases the long - time efficiency to 93% . as a result ,",
    "small modulations in the rate of transport to the rp states have only a minimal influence on the long - time efficiency within our model , and thus will not substantially shift the functional behavior of psii .",
    "we now analyze the dependence of the amount of coherence on the initial state . in figure",
    "[ fig_zofe_transfer_initallexcincoher]c , we see that for the delocalized initial state there is a significantly smaller amount of excitonic coherence involved in the transfer dynamics compared to the amount for the localized state in figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer]c ( note the different range of the y axis of figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer_initallexcincoher]c compared to figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer]c ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that there is no initial excitonic coherence present in the case of the delocalized initial state . in figure",
    "[ fig_zofe_transfer_initallexcincoher]d , the pattern of the time - integrated coherence between the individual sites appears overall similar to that for the localized initial state in figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer]d .",
    "however , looking closer , there are differences , which are reflected in the large difference between the currents resulting from the delocalized and localized initial states .",
    "we note also , that since in figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer_initallexcincoher]c and  d absolute values are summed up , changes of the signs of the individual terms that would correspond to opposite directions of the corresponding population currents are not visible .",
    "for example currents that lead to a flow of excitation back to lhcii in figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer_initallexcincoher]b , which have negative signs , can not be identified in figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer_initallexcincoher]d , because the absolute value is taken before integrating the coherences .",
    "but we see in figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer_initallexcincoher]d that just as the current between lhcii and cp43 is smaller for the delocalized initial state , so the imaginary parts of the coherences between lhcii and cp43 pigments are also weaker than before in figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer]d .",
    "we have also performed simulations for other initial states , including localized , delocalized superpositions with coherence in the site or exciton basis , and for localized initial excitations with specific phase relations that were previously found to lead to directed transport for models of chains of coupled sites  @xcite .",
    "in all these cases , we do not find any significant change in the overall efficiency of the transport to the rp2 state , showing a remarkable robustness of the overall long - range energy transport with respect to the initial conditions .",
    "we now investigate the influence of the coupling between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom on the energy transfer .",
    "the coupling to the vibrations is treated approximately in our model so that it is important to consider how sensitive the energy transfer is with respect to changes in this part of the model .",
    "furthermore , we expect the coupling to the vibrations to be an important component of the energy transfer dynamics , since it can enhance the transport , as is well known and has been studied for several smaller scale ( single complex ) systems ( see e.g.  refs .",

    "but this back - and - forth oscillation of a relatively small amount of population does not make the overall transport less efficient .",
    "also in the current from lhcii to cp43 , shown in figure  [ fig_vary_coupl_strength_vibr_zofe]c , there are now oscillations in the magnitude of the current .",
    "but the current still is always directed from the lhcii towards cp43 , i.e. , there is no backflow to lhcii , and the current is positive at all times . on the other hand ,",

    "there are no strong fluctuations in the magnitude of these currents .",
    "but they are larger now compared to the original situation where the coupling to the vibrations is stronger .",
    "the transport dynamics for the case of @xmath125 are shown in figures  [ fig_vary_coupl_strength_vibr_zofe]d , e. in panel  d , aside from the much smaller amount of population transported to rp2 , we can also see that it takes much longer for the population to be transported away from the lhcii .",
    "the reason for that becomes apparent when we look at the population of pigment  7 in lhcii : the population oscillates back and forth between the lhcii pigments many times , and is not able to leave the lhcii .",
    "it is trapped in the lhcii for a quite long time due to ( unitary ) localization inside the complex because of non - uniform pigment energies . in panel",
    "e , we see that the current between lhcii and cp43 oscillates fast between positive and negative values .",
    "that means that excitation is flowing back and forth between these two proteins , quickly changing direction .",
    "the other currents are almost zero , because only a small amount of population can pass through cp43 and reach the reaction center .",
    "why the strong decrease of the vibrational coupling leads to such a trapping , can be understood with the notion of vibrationally enhanced transport : the coupling to vibrations leads to transport through vibronic resonance and its absence leads to trapping .",
    "this concept is depicted in figure  [ vibronic_resonance ] :        between the excited electronic states of the pigments there are energy gaps that , when they are large compared to the dipole - dipole interaction strength between the respective pigments , cause the excitation to be trapped on one or a few pigments , because of the off - resonance of the electronic transitions .",
    "but if the electronic excitation of a pigment couples to vibrational modes with vibrational energies large enough and with a coupling strength large enough compared to the energy gaps , then the vibrational energy levels can fill the gaps and make the transport of excitation from one pigment to another resonant , thereby enhancing the transport . furthermore , the coupling to the continuum of vibrational modes leads to relaxation down the energy manifold that is needed for the energy funnel , directing the transfer to the rp states , to work .    for a delocalized initial state , in the case of very weak coupling to the vibrations ,",
    "the trapping in the lhcii and cp43 will have smaller consequences for the tranfer efficiency , because there is also initial excitation in the reaction center that can be transferred to the rp states .",
    "further simulations have shown that for a delocalized initial condition the population that is transferred to rp2  in the case of the very weak coupling to the vibrations  can be three times higher than for the localized initial state in figure  [ fig_vary_coupl_strength_vibr_zofe]d . however , the population transferred to rp2 is still by more than a factor of two lower than when the coupling to the vibrations has the original strength . on the other hand ,",
    "we have found in further simulations that for the original vibrational coupling @xmath129 , and when @xmath130 ,  @xmath131 , changing the initial state has little influence on the efficiency of the energy transfer .",
    "only when the vibrational coupling is decreased beyond this , @xmath132@xmath133 , does the initial state have a significant impact on the overall efficiency .",
    "this shows again a high robustness of the energy transfer to variations of the initial condition .",
    "next , let us consider how decreasing the coupling to the vibrations affects the coherence involved in the transport dynamics .",

    ", there is more coherence between the sites now , because the dephasing through the vibrations is weaker .",
    "the excitonic coherence , by contrast , decreases ( see panel  a compared to figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer]c ) which is expected because part of it is created by the coupling to the vibrations .",
    "remarkably , these changes in the coherence do not affect the overall transport efficiency much , as we have seen in figure  [ fig_vary_coupl_strength_vibr_zofe ] .",
    "c , d , but the coupling to the vibrational environment is decreased * by a factor of 10 * compared to figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer ] . ]",
    "so far , we have only _ decreased _ the coupling to the vibrations in relation to our original model .",
    "it would also be instructive to investigate the energy tranfer at stronger coupling as well .",
    "stronger coupling , however , leads to problems in the zofe calculation , because of the limited range of non - markovianity for which the zofe approximation is valid  @xcite . to still be able to gain an insight into the behavior at stronger coupling and  at least roughly  assess the energy transfer efficiency",
    ", we therefore use a full markovian lindblad calculation , where the markov approximation is applied to the electron - vibration coupling . based on the reasoning of ref .",
    "@xcite , an assessment of the transport efficiency can be reasonable with an appropriate markovian description . as a check",
    ", we also calculate the cases of weaker vibrational coupling again with the markovian lindblad simulation , so that we can compare with the previous zofe simulation results .",
    "a description of the lindblad calculation is given in appendix  [ app_pure_lindblad_simul ] .",
    "figure  [ fig_lindblad_vary_coupl_strength_vibr ] summarizes the effect of stronger couplings with such a lindblad calculation , where the strength of the coupling to the vibrational environment is varied by a factor between 0.0001 and 50 . here ,",
    "factor 1 corresponds to the coupling strength in the original model .",
    "the initial state is the same localized initial state as for figure  [ fig_vary_coupl_strength_vibr_zofe ] , where all population is on the two pigments  7 and  10 in the lhcii , without coherence in the site basis . ]",
    "we see that as before for the zofe calculation , the lindblad results also show the highest transport efficiency in the case where the vibrational coupling is decreased by a factor of ten with respect to the original model . in this case , also the amount of integrated population of the rp2 state is very similar to the zofe result . however , the rp2 populations for the original coupling and for the cases of weakest coupling , calculated with lindblad , are in less good agreement with the zofe results .",
    "let us now look at the cases where the vibrational coupling is increased compared to the original model . in figure  [ fig_lindblad_vary_coupl_strength_vibr ] , we see that as the coupling is increased , the transport efficiency becomes lower and lower , until for a fifty - fold increase , it is almost zero .",
    "at the same time the amount of population that stays in the lhcii becomes larger and larger .",
    "this suppression of the transport when the coupling to the vibrations is stronger may be understood in terms of the quantum zeno effect  @xcite , where the electronic excitation interacts with the vibrations ",
    "i.e. , it is `` measured '' by the vibrations in the site basis ",
    "so strongly , that is , at such a high rate , that the excitation is forced to stay in the original state and can not move anymore . in terms of the expression for the population currents , equation  ( [ total_current ] ) , this effect can be understood from the fact that the stronger coupling to the vibrations causes stronger dephasing , destroying the coherence between the sites that drives the energy transfer , and thereby diminishes the energy transfer .",
    "because of this effect at stronger coupling and the trapping of the excitation at weak coupling , the highest transport efficiency is obtained in the intermediate regime . there",
    ", the magnitude of the coupling to the vibrations is such that it gives the optimal balance between vibrationally enhanced transport ( as described in figure  [ vibronic_resonance ] ) and the quantum zeno effect .",
    "these results of the lindblad calculation therefore provide more evidence that the strength of the coupling to the vibrations that we used in our original model lie roughly in the region of optimal coupling strength .",
    "however , remarkably , these results again show that the energy transfer efficiency could be even ( slightly ) higher at a factor @xmath134 weaker coupling to the vibrations .",
    "in this work , we simulated the long - range inter - complex energy transfer in the psii supercomplex  from lhcii via the core complex cp43 to the reaction center  by means of a full quantum calculation , using a non - markovian zofe quantum master equation description .",
    "we found that nearly all energy from the initial electronic excitation is transported to the reaction center within about 200  ps , and that after 1  ns , about 80% of the energy is transformed into charge separation in the reaction center .",
    "less than 5% is lost through radiative and non - radiative decay within this time .",
    "these findings for the overall energy transfer dynamics are in good agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a modified - redfield - generalized - frster ( mrgf ) rate - equation method was applied to calculate the long - range energy transfer in the entire psii supercomplex . in the mrgf method , strongly coupled pigments are assigned to domains treated with a modified - redfield description , whereas excitation transfer between the domains , where the couplings are weaker , is treated with a generalized - frster description . in the present work , to compare our zofe quantum - master - equation results to the mrgf rate - equation description of ref .",
    "@xcite , we used the mrgf method to calculate the energy transfer in the truncated supercomplex lhcii - cp43-rc of psii that we considered .",
    "the resulting energy transfer dynamics are in very good quantitative agreement with that calculated with the zofe master equation , showing that the simpler mrgf rate equation provides an adequate description of the quantum energy transfer dynamics and energy transfer efficiency of psii .",
    "the observation that the mrgf results agree well with the zofe results shows that the subdivision into domains , which is related to the notion of supertransfer , i.e. , coherent delocalization inside domains leads to enhanced transfer rates between the domains  @xcite , is a reasonable approach to describe energy transfer in large light - harvesting complexes , where the coupling between the pigments can be very inhomogeneous .",
    "we have further shown that excitation energy transfer is significantly slower within a pure frster calculation , which further supports the importance of supertransfer for rapid excitation transport within psii .",
    "the close agreement between zofe and mrgf is also consistent with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a full quantum description of electronic excitation transfer is compared to that of a classical rate equation , and it is shown that the rate equation description is capable of capturing the overall features of the energy transfer when properly derived from the full quantum description .",
    "in addition to the commonly used description in terms of time - dependent populations of the excited electronic states of the pigments , we also analyzed the energy transfer dynamics in terms of excitation population _",
    "currents _ between the pigments .",
    "this analysis revealed the pathways and directions of the energy transfer between the individual pigments and the net fow of energy between the different complexes .",

    "@xcite . the energy transfer between different proteins",
    "was found to rely on several different pathways .",
    "interestingly , instead of being uniformly directed towards the reaction center , often excitation energy is transported in loops between pigments , i.e. , excitation is transferred from one pigment to a neighboring pigment and from there to the next , etc .",

    "such loops were found in all three subcomplexes that we considered , lhcii , cp43 , and the reaction center . in the reaction center , the efficient excitation energy transport to the charge separated states appeared to rely mainly on only two pigments ( 30 and 32 ) , providing evidence that the rest of the reaction center pigments are needed primarily for their role in the electron transport rather than for the excitation transfer ; some of these reaction center pigments appear to constitute a strong loop excitation current , but do not contribute to the net transport of excitation energy to the charge separated states . to test this conclusion , which was drawn from the analysis of the pathways of integrated population currents , we ran additional simulations with all reaction center pigments  except for 30 and 32  decoupled from the rest of the pigments so that transfer of excitation to and from these decoupled pigments was inhibited , but leaving the coupling to the charge separated states unmodified . the resulting efficiency of the energy transport to the charge separated states in this restricted model",
    "was found to be the same as in the original model where excitation transport to the other reaction center pigments was allowed , showing that the excitation energy transport to and inside the reaction center appears to rely indeed only on the two pigments 30 and 32 .",
    "this confirmed the conclusions drawn from the analysis of the integrated population currents and showed that this analysis is suited to identify transport pathways and assess their importance , providing a useful tool for the investigation of design - function relationships in light - harvesting systems .    by simulating the energy transfer with the zofe master equation",
    ", we were able to quantify the amount of electronic coherence that is involved in the energy transfer dynamics .",
    "motivated by the description of the energy transfer in terms of population currents and the different roles of imaginary and real part of the coherence presented in a companion paper  @xcite , we quantified the real and imaginary components of the coherence between the pigments separately .",
    "we found that the real components , which are related to localization of excitation due to energy gaps between the pigments  @xcite , are overall larger than the imaginary components , which are proportional to the population currents between the pigments and drive the excitation energy transfer in the psii supercomplex .",
    "to find out how the energy transfer in psii depends on the initial condition  which is determined by the specific features of the light used for the excitation  we ran simulations of the energy transfer for different initial states ; first we considered initial excitation that is localized on only two lhcii pigments ; then we started from an initial state in which the excitation is completely delocalized over the lhcii , cp43 , and reaction center pigments .",
    "we found that even though for the delocalized initial state the energy transfer dynamics of course look different from that for the localized initial state , the overall efficiency of the energy transfer to the charge separation in the reaction center is nevertheless the same in both cases .",
    "also the overall pattern of the energy transfer pathways between the individual pigments is very similar for the different initial conditions  for both short - range ( intra - complex ) and long - range ( inter - complex ) energy transfer .",
    "this shows that the energy transfer in psii is remarkably robust with respect to the initial conditions .    to learn how sensitive the energy transfer dynamics are to variations in the coupling between the electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom , we varied the strength of this coupling to the vibrations in our simulations : decreasing the coupling to the vibrations for all pigments by a factor of ten compared to the original situation did not change the energy transfer efficiency much",
    " it even slightly increased the efficiency , showing that the energy transfer is very robust to variations of the coupling to the vibrations .",
    "even when the coupling to the vibrations was decreased by a factor of 100 , the amount of energy transferred to the charge separation within 1  ns decreased only by about 10% . we assign this to a decrease of the well known effect of vibrationally enhanced transport , which helps the transfer of energy through more resonant energy levels when coupling to vibrations ( vibrational energy levels ) is present .",
    "only when the electron - vibration coupling was decreased by a factor of 1,000 , does the amount of energy transferred decrease significantly ( by up to a factor 4 compared to the original situation ) , due to trapping of the excitation in the lhcii complex .",
    "this trapping is characteristic of the predominantly unitary dynamics occuring in the absence of vibrationally enhanced transport .",
    "these observations show that for psii the strength of the coupling to the vibrations that is needed for the effect of vibrational enhanced transport to direct the energy transfer efficiently to the reaction center is rather small .    however , in contrast to the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex , where calculations have revealed that the transport efficiency does not fall under 70% when the coupling to the vibrational environment is decreased , even to extremely small coupling strength  @xcite , for psii we found that the efficiency can become very low  almost zero  for extremely small coupling to the vibrations .",
    "this shows that contrary to fmo , for psii the coupling to the vibrations is crucial for achieving efficient transport .",
    "to assess how the energy transfer changes when the coupling to the vibrations is increased compared to the original situation , we performed markovian lindblad simulations , instead of the zofe calculations because the latter were not applicable in this parameter range . here , we found that if the coupling to the vibrations is stronger than in the original situation and is further increased step by step , the efficiency of the energy transfer decreases monotonically , until for a fifty - fold increase of the coupling , almost no energy is transferred to the reaction center anymore ( within the reference time of 1  ns ) due to the strong dephasing that destroys the coherence needed for the energy transfer  @xcite .",
    "these approximate lindblad simulations , together with the zofe simulations , thus provide evidence that the original strength of the coupling to the vibrations lies in the parameter region for optimal energy transfer efficiency .",
    "we showed , however , that for a coupling that is about ten times weaker than in the original situation , the efficiency could be even slightly higher .",
    "this could be an important feature to reflect upon , in the light of the discussion about the possible ( evolutionary ) optimization of natural light - harvesting systems like psii .",
    "to be able to roughly assess the efficiency of excitation energy transfer in our truncated psii model for an extended range of the electron - vibration coupling , in section  [ sec_full_markov_lindblad_simul ] we used a pure lindblad simulation for the excitation energy transfer , applying the markov approximation to the electron - vibration coupling . here , we briefly describe the calculation and how the corresponding parameters are obtained .    for the simulation ,",
    "we employ a lindblad master equation  ( [ lindblad_master ] ) , where we now include lindblad terms describing the coupling of the electronic excitation to the vibrations of the pigments and protein environment  in addition to the lindblad terms for transfer to the rp1 and rp2 states and radiative and non - radiative decay to the ground state ( relaxation terms ) that were also included in the zofe simulations .",
    "the new lindblad terms describing the electron - vibrational coupling contain lindblad operators @xmath135 and coupling parameters @xmath136 for each pigment @xmath8 , so that  instead of eq .",
    "( [ zofe_lindblad_master ] ) for the zofe simulation  we now have the pure lindblad master equation @xmath137 & + \\sum_{n=0}^{32}\\gamma^{\\rm lind}_n\\left(l_n\\rho l_n^{\\dagger } - \\frac{1}{2 } l_n^{\\dagger}l_n\\rho - \\frac{1}{2}\\rho l_n^{\\dagger}l_n \\right)\\\\ &   + \\sum_{i=0}^{39}\\widetilde{\\gamma}_i\\left(\\widetilde{l}_i\\rho \\widetilde{l}_i^{\\dagger } - \\frac{1}{2}\\widetilde{l}_i^{\\dagger}\\widetilde{l}_i\\rho - \\frac{1}{2}\\rho \\widetilde{l}_i^{\\dagger}\\widetilde{l}_i \\right ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the terms in the second line again describe transfer to the rp1 and rp2 states and radiative and non - radiative decay . in the lindblad term in the first line ,",
    "the electronic excitation of each pigment @xmath8 is coupled to vibrations with respective coupling strength @xmath136 . to calculate the excitation energy transfer from the full lindblad description  ( [ full_lindblad_master ] ) , we need to assume values for the coupling parameters @xmath136 . in the following ,",
    "we show how we obtain these parameters through a simple approximation from the parameters that we used to describe the non - markovian electron - vibration coupling within the zofe description . to this end , let us again consider the special form of the environment correlation function  ( [ alpha_sum_exps ] ) used in the zofe description @xmath138 the pure lindblad description  ( [ full_lindblad_master ] ) is obtained in the markov limit , where @xmath139 i.e.  @xmath43 decays fast compared to the timescales of the system dynamics . to express the parameters @xmath136 through the parameters of eq .",

    "( [ o_init ] ) ) . since we know that in the markov limit @xmath145 , the auxiliary operator of the zofe master equation becomes the constant operator @xmath146 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ o_bar ] ) and ( [ o_init ] ) )  @xcite , from comparison with eq .",
    "( [ o_bar_markov_limit ] ) it follows that we can approximate the needed coupling parameters for the full lindblad descriptions as @xmath147 i.e.  in the case where the @xmath53 are large compared to the system energies .",
    "we note that in order for the @xmath136 to stay finite in the @xmath148 limit , not only the @xmath53 , but also at least one of the parameters @xmath52 has to go to infinity . inserting the parameters for the electron - vibration coupling of the zofe simulation ( according to section  [ sec_approx_spec_dens_for_zofe ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ gamma_lindblad ] ) , we find the following values for the parameters @xmath136 that we used for our full lindblad simulation in section  [ sec_full_markov_lindblad_simul ] : + @xmath149 for the chl  a pigments in lhcii , + @xmath150 for the chl  b pigments in lhcii , + @xmath151 for the pigments in cp43 , + and @xmath152 for the pigments in the reaction center .",
    "+ we can see from the fact that these values are not at all large compared to the system energies ( the differences of the eigenenergies of the system hamiltonian are in the range of up to 1,300  @xmath9 ) that the markov approximation is not well justified here and that therefore our full lindblad simulations should be considered to be a rather crude approximation of the non - markovian dynamics .",
    "to see the influence of the radical pair states on the transport dynamics , we now look at the dynamics with the coupling to the rp states switched off .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    we see in figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer_nocoupltorp]a that up to a certain time , the populations in the proteins with and without coupling are equal .",
    "the further a protein is away from the rp states , the later the population without the coupling deviates from the population where the coupling is present . instead of falling off fast , now  without the coupling to the rp states  after around 200  ps the populations decline much slower",
    "; this residual , slower decline is due to the radiative and non - radiative decay of the pigment excited states .",
    "after 200  ps , the residual , average population per pigment is highest in the rc , and it is lowest in lhcii .",
    "this is because the average energy in the rc is lowest and that in lhcii is highest , providing the `` energy funnel '' that directs the transport to the rc .",
    "let us next look at the coherence .",
    "when we compare the total coherence in figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer_nocoupltorp]c , where the coupling to the rp states is switched off , with that in figure  [ fig_zofe_transfer]c , where the coupling to the rp states is present , we see that up to about 10  ps the coherence with and without coupling is equal .",
    "after that , however , the coherence without coupling to the rp states goes to finite values that decrease only slowly , whereas in the case when the coupling is present , the coherence falls off to zero .",
    "this behavior can be explained with the cauchy - schwarz inequality @xmath153 that holds for the coherences @xmath154 and the populations @xmath155 , @xmath156 of any density matrix @xmath79 .",
    "it says that coherences can only ever arise between states that are populated .",
    "the larger the populations of two given states are , the larger can the coherence between these states potentially be . in the case",
    "where there is transfer to the rp states , population is taken away from the excited states of the pigments by the rp states , and consequently , the coherence , being limited by the population through the cauchy - schwarz inequality , has to fall off to zero .",
    "on the other hand , when the transfer to the rp states is switched off , the population remains in the excited states of the pigments and the coherence stays finite .",
