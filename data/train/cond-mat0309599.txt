    "third sound is an oscillation of the superfluid component in the plane of the film , with the normal component clamped by viscosity to the substrate that supports the film .",
    "this sound mode was first discussed theoretically by atkins for superfluid  films in the context of the two - fluid model.@xcite the oscillations of the superfluid component cause the level of the film to locally rise and fall ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "the restoring force that stabilizes the oscillations is the van der waals attraction between the helium and the substrate .",
    "the possibility of observing third sound in superfluid films was discussed by eggenkamp et al.,@xcite and the first experimental report of surface modes identified as third sound was by schechter et al.@xcite here we report theoretical calculations of the spectrum of cavity modes of third sound in superfluid  films with cylindrical symmetry and compare the results with the observed spectra .",
    "we consider  films with thicknesses of order @xmath0 , roughly @xmath1 coherence lengths at zero pressure .",
    "these are thin films in the sense that they are expected to be in the either the axial or planar phase.@xcite in either case the orbital anisotropy axis , @xmath2 , is anchored normal to the substrate .",
    "the analysis reported here assumes that the @xmath2 vector remains fixed in the presence of small oscillations of the surface .",
    "we expect this to be a good approximation for long - wavelength , low - frequency third sound , since the coupling of the low - frequency normal - flapping mode in -a to transverse currents vanishes in the limit of exact particle - hole symmetry.@xcite we also neglect edge currents associated with the broken chiral symmetry of -a , which may play an important role in nearly two - dimensional films with specular surfaces , but are not relevant for third sound in the geometry considered here.@xcite thus , in zero magnetic field the hydrodynamics of the superfluid film is defined by the phase mode and the surface excitation of the film , and reduces to scalar hydrodynamics . at temperatures @xmath3",
    "the viscous penetration depth is of order @xmath4 , for low frequency third sound ( @xmath5hz ) ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the viscosity and density of normal ) , and so we can safely consider the excitations ( normal component ) to be viscously clamped to the substrate . furthermore , for third sound , the motion of the condensate is incompressible and confined to the plane of the film .",
    "oscillations of the condensate then lead to height oscillations of the film .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations governing the excitation of the film include the continuity equation for mass conservation , + _ s d_s=0 , [ eq : continuity ] where @xmath7 is the mass density , @xmath8 is the deviation of the film height from its equilibrium value , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the superfluid density averaged over the thickness of the film . the pair momentum , or superfluid velocity , related to the phase @xmath11 of the condensate s wave function , @xmath12 , describes the in - plane motion of the condensate and obeys the josephson equation of motion , = -=-f+s_ft , [ eq : josephson ] where @xmath13 is the chemical potential , @xmath14 is the van der waals force per unit mass , @xmath15 is the entropy per unit mass and @xmath16 is the absolute temperature .",
    "the oscillations of the condensate are coupled to entropy oscillations , and thus the height oscillations of third sound are coupled to the heat current in the film .",
    "this coupling , described by the heat transport equation , c_f d+s_f t - d_f^2 t = 0 , [ eq : heat ] where @xmath17 is the specific heat and @xmath18 is the thermal conductivity per unit mass , is a key mechanism for damping of third sound cavity modes .",
    "if we neglect heat transport in the film , then the height deviation , @xmath8 , and the superfluid velocity , @xmath19 , obey two - dimensional wave equations with the phase velocity given by @xmath20 . for cylindrically symmetric films the eigenfunctions are products of bessel functions ( regular at @xmath21 ) and azimuthal harmonics , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the wavevector for the mode and @xmath24 .",
    "the cavity mode eigenfrequencies are determined by the boundary conditions at the edge ( @xmath25 ) of the film . for fixed boundary conditions , @xmath26 , the resonant frequencies and wavevectors are @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the @xmath29 zero of @xmath30 .",
    "for free boundary conditions , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are the zeroes of the derivative , @xmath34 . the general solution to the wave equation",
    "can then be expressed as an eigenmode expansion , ( r,,t)=_m , na_mnj_m(_mnr / c ) e^ime^-i_mnt , where the amplitudes , @xmath35 , are determined by driving forces that couple to the displacement .",
    "schechter et al.@xcite observed standing waves of third sound on a circular substrate by exciting the surface with an a.c .",
    "electric field normal to the film . as noted in ref .",
    "the modes for thicker films ( @xmath36 nm ) are reasonably well indexed by assuming fixed boundary conditions , whereas thinner films ( @xmath37 nm ) are better indexed assuming a free boundary condition .",

    "the capacitive excitation ring is displaced above the film and is slightly tilted about an axis ( y - axis ) the horizontal plane of the film.@xcite if we measure the azimuthal angle with respect to the orthogonal direction in the plane ( x - axis ) then the resulting forces on the film are symmetric with respect to @xmath48 .",

    "in general the damping of third sound is frequency dependent . in the following",
    "we calculate the frequency dependent damping rate for third sound that results from heat transport induced by the oscillations of the entropy associated with oscillations of the condensate .",

    "[ eq : amplitude_spectrum ] in the response formula .",
    "the damping rate contains two terms , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a constant damping rate which we attribute to roughness of the substrate and @xmath57 is the damping obtained from the heat transport equation ( eq . [ eq : heat ] ) , _ 1 ( , t ) = 12 ( ) ^2 ^2 _ 1 ^2 , where @xmath58 .",
    "note that the damping rate diverges for @xmath59 because the superfluid stiffness vanishes whereas the thermal conductivity is finite .",

    "in summary , the thicker films ( 250 - 400 nm ) at low temperatures are reasonably well described by the equations of two - fluid hydrodynamics with damping due to surface roughness and thermal transport .",
    "the latter mechanism suppresses the higher frequency modes and diverges for @xmath65 . in this regime",
    "the theoretically predicted modes and their spectral weights correspond to those observed in the experiment .",
    "the apparent mode splitting or mixing that onsets at higher temperatures , @xmath66 , may indicate a cross - over to a another mechanism for dissipation or , what seems more likely given the abruptness of the onset , a phase transition of the superfluid phase of the film .",
    "for thinner films ( 170 - 250 nm ) we are not able to describe the observed spectra using two - fluid hydrodynamics with either set of boundary conditions and the same damping mechanisms .",
    "although the frequencies of the modes can be associated with modes calculated with free boundary conditions , the spectral weights for the modes calculated from the theory do not agree with experiment .",
    "this fact , and mixing or splitting observed in thicker films may indicate that there is a phase transition at temperatures well below @xmath67 for films with @xmath68 .",
