    "single - dish surveys have shown that molecular outflows are ubiquitous in high - mass star forming regions @xcite . according to the standard paradigm of low - mass star formation",
    "this provides a statistical argument that high - mass stars may form via accretion processes .",
    "however , given the typical large distances ( @xmath15 kpc ) and clustering environment of massive star formation , single - dish observations of @xmath16 resolutions can not resolve the detailed structures of massive molecular outflows or identify their driving sources .",
    "recently there have been an increasing number of interferometric studies which provide new insights into the morphology and kinematics of massive molecular outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , but the statistics is still poor and many basic questions , e.g. , how massive molecular outflows systematically differ from their low - mass counterparts , how they are driven , and how they affect their surroundings and host clouds , remain open . to address these questions , which are essential to understand massive star formation , a large set of high - angular - resolution observations covering a wide range of luminosity and evolutionary stages is needed .    toward these goals we study g240.31 + 0.07 ( hereafter g240 ) , an active high - mass star - forming region with a far - infrared luminosity of @xmath0 l@xmath1 at a distance of 6.4 kpc @xcite .",

    "however , limited by low angular resolutions , neither of the two single - dish studies provided a detailed analysis of the outflow morphology and kinematics .",
    "high - angular - resolution observations are crucial to unveil the outflow nature of this luminous source .    here",

    "we used titan as the primary flux calibrator and 3c273 as the bandpass calibrator . the time dependent gain was monitored by observing quasars j0730 - 116 and j0826 - 225 every 23 mins .",

    "thus spatial structures more extended than @xmath21 were not sampled in the sma observations .",
    "this spatial filtering can significantly affect the @xmath3co , @xmath4co ( 21 ) maps at velocities close to the cloud velocity . to recover the missing short spacing information we observed the @xmath3co , @xmath4co ( 21 ) emission with the cso 10.4 m telescope on 2008 february 12 . during the observation the weather condition was excellent for 1 mm waveband with @xmath25 .",

    "the final maps were smoothed to 2 km s@xmath8 per channel .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard class package .",
    "we combined the sma compact and cso @xmath3co , @xmath4co data in miriad following a procedure outlined in @xcite .",

    "in figure [ continuum]a , the 1.3 mm continuum emission observed with the sma compact array shows an elongated envelope with its major axis in the northeast - southwest direction , as well as a minor peak to the northeast . at a higher angular resolution of @xmath12 the central part of the structure",
    "is resolved into three dusty cores , namely mm1 , mm2 , and mm3 from north to south ( figure [ continuum]b ) .",
    "assuming optically thin dust emission , the dust mass can be estimated according to @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the dust mass , @xmath35 the continuum flux at frequency @xmath36 , @xmath37 the source distance , @xmath38 the planck function at dust temperature @xmath39 , and @xmath40 in @xmath41g@xmath8 the dust opacity @xcite .",

    "we then adopt @xmath45 k , @xmath46 , and a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 , to estimate the mass of the larger envelope and the combined mass of the three dusty cores , which amount to 150 m@xmath1 and 40 m@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty of this estimate mainly comes from the determinations of @xmath43 and @xmath39 ; for example , deviations of @xmath47 in @xmath43 or @xmath48 k in @xmath39 will induce @xmath49% uncertainty in the mass estimates .",
    "figure [ flow_int ] shows the integrated @xmath3co , @xmath4co ( 21 ) emission observed with the sma , as well as the _",
    "irac imaging for comparison . because the interferometric filtering to extended emission helps to distinguish the outflow from ambient gas , we present the sma observations without merging with the single - dish data .",
    "the cloud velocity ( @xmath50 ) with respect to the local standard of rest is about 67.5 km s@xmath8 , which is adopted from the cso c@xmath18o ( 21 ) observations by @xcite and consistent with our sma c@xmath18o ( 21 ) observations .",
    "the low - velocity channels , i.e. , 5864 km s@xmath8 for the blueshifted lobe and 7480 km s@xmath8 for the redshifted lobe in figure [ flow_int]a , are chosen to highlight wide - angle structures and to avoid contamination from diffuse gas in the surrounding , and the high - velocity channels ( figure [ flow_int]b ) are those in the outer line wings .",
    "the low - velocity @xmath3co emission clearly reveals a northwest - southeast ( nw - se ) bipolar outflow centered at the group of the mm peaks and extending about 1.3 pc from end to end ( figure [ flow_int]a ) . the outflow shell highlighted by limb - brightening outlines a quasi - parabolic structure with a wide opening angle .",
    "both the spatial separation of the two lobes of such a wide - angle outflow and the partial overlap of blue- and redshifted emission in the nw lobe suggest that the flow axis is moderately inclined to the plane of sky .",
    "we suggest the molecular outflow seen in the @xmath3co emission as ambient gas swept - up by an underlying wide - angle wind ( see  [ comparison ] ) . in this context , the nw wind is overall moving away from us , sweeping up ambient gas to create the redshifted @xmath3co outflow , but could be partly moving toward us in its near side , causing the blueshifted @xmath3co emission .",
    "the patchy appearance of the blueshifted emission might be attributed to the localized density structure of the medium .",
    "the se counterpart of the wind may be expanding into a medium which is less dense in the far - side and would not create appreciable redshifted @xmath3co emission . immediately to the southeast of the bipolar outflow , there is a minor extension with overlapping red- and blueshifted emission , which might arise from another outflow .",
    "meanwhile , the high - velocity @xmath3co emission coincides with the inner part of the low - velocity bipolar outflow , with the bulk blueshifted emission revealing a clump in the middle of the low - velocity se lobe and the redshifted emission a conical structure narrower than the low - velocity nw lobe ( figure [ flow_int]b ) .",
    "the bipolar outflow is also detected in the @xmath4co emission with a morphology similar to but slightly less extended than the @xmath3co outflow ( figure [ flow_int]c ) .",
    "_ spitzer _ irac images often reveal outflow cavities through scatted light in the 3.6 @xmath5 m band and molecular outflow driving agents ( e.g. , underlying jets or winds ) through shocked h@xmath17 emission in the 4.5 @xmath5 m band @xcite . in figure",
    "[ flow_int]d , the irac three - color composite image of the g240 central area yields a nw - se nebula in the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath5 m emission .",
    "the north to south shell of the nebula appears prominent in the 3.6 @xmath5 m band ( _ blue _ ) and coincides well with the north to south edge of the @xmath3co outflow , suggesting its emission being dominated by scattered light from the outflow cavity wall , whereas the nebula structure coincident with the main nw - se @xmath3co lobe shows diffuse 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath5 m emission , which might be dominated by scattered light and shocked h@xmath17 emission .",
    "figures [ sma12ch ] and [ smacso12ch ] show channel maps of the @xmath3co emission from the sma observations alone and from the combined sma and cso data at low velocities , respectively .",
    "it is immediately evident that for channels around @xmath50 the combined data effectively recover the extended emission filtered out by the interferometer and significantly improve the side - lobes of the interferometric observations .",
    "in particular the diffuse gas emissions at 66 and 68 km s@xmath8 are mostly filtered out by the interferometer and recovered with the combined data . from a comparison among the spectra constructed from the cso , sma , and",
    "the combined data ( figure [ spec ] ) , the sma compact array observations recover less than @xmath51 of the cso flux at the line center , and about @xmath52 of the cso flux at the line wing of 54 and 80 km s@xmath8 , whereas the combined sma and cso data recover more than 85% of the cso flux all the way from 54 to 80 km s@xmath8 ; at the outer line wing of @xmath5352 km s@xmath8 and @xmath5482 km s@xmath8 , there is little missing flux in the sma observations .",
    "outflow features emerge at 64 and 70 km s@xmath8 ; the se wide - angle shell at 64 km s@xmath8 appears less prominent in figure [ smacso12ch ] than that in figure [ sma12ch ] due to the confusion from diffuse gas .",
    "emissions from outflow structures appear predominant in channels of @xmath55 km s@xmath8 and @xmath56 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the two lobes of the wide - angle outflow accord with each other in orientation and have similar opening angles at the base .",
    "they both appear more collimated at higher velocities : the nw lobe has a fan - shaped morphology at low velocities ( most prominent at 72 and 74 km s@xmath8 ) and a narrower , _",
    "v_-shaped appearance at high velocities ( most prominent at 84 to 88 km s@xmath8 ) ; the se lobe shows the wide - angle shell at low velocities ( most prominent at 62 and 64 km s@xmath8 ) and a clump away from the mm peaks at high velocities ( most prominent at 48 to 52 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "again the difference in detailed velocity structures of the two lobes could be at least in part attributed to the localized density structure of the environment within which the underlying wind is expanding . as seen in the integrated emission , a possible secondary outflow to the southeast of the mm peaks can be found in both blue- and redshifted channels .",
    "channel maps of the @xmath4co emission are shown in figures [ sma13ch ] and [ smacso13ch ] , for the sma alone and the combined sma and cso data around @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "channels of 6470 km s@xmath8 are dominated by surrounding diffuse gas but also show extension along the outflow orientation .",
    "there is an embedded dense clump showing a northeast - southwest velocity gradient , which is also detected in other dense gas tracers .",
    "emission from the bipolar outflow dominates channel of @xmath5762 km s@xmath8 and @xmath5872 km s@xmath8 . the @xmath4co emission appears confined within 10 km s@xmath8 from @xmath50 , for both blue- and redshifted lobes .",
    "we use the combined sma and cso data to estimate the gas mass of the outflow , following @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath37 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are the outflow gas mass in m@xmath1 , excitation temperature of the @xmath3co ( 21 ) transition , source distance in kpc , optical depth for @xmath3co ( 21 ) , and line flux in jy , respectively .",
    "we adopt an excitation temperature of 30 k , a @xmath3co - to - h@xmath17 abundance of @xmath64 , and a mean gas atomic weight of 1.36 . assuming the same excitation temperature for @xmath3co ( 21 ) and @xmath4co ( 21 ) , we calculate @xmath62 according to @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the abundance ratio of @xmath3co to @xmath4co , which is estimated to be 103 at a galactocentric distance of 12.7 kpc for g240 @xcite .",
    "many @xmath3co outflow studies estimate outflow mass either by assuming that @xmath3co emission is optically thin at all outflow velocities or by correcting for a constant @xmath3co opacity .",
    "recently a few interferometric outflow studies use single - dish @xmath3co/@xmath4co line ratios to correct for @xmath3co opacity as a function of velocity @xcite .",
    "our interferometric , beam - matching observations of @xmath3co and @xmath4co emission , both complemented by short spacing information from single - dish observations , enable a measurement of spatial and spectral distribution of @xmath3co/@xmath4co line ratios , thus a more sophisticated correction for the @xmath3co opacity . we assume the @xmath3co emission is optically thin where the @xmath4co is not detected . the momentum and energy of the outflow is then derived following @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively , where ( and hereafter ) @xmath69 denotes the outflow velocity relative to @xmath50 . to avoid contamination from the ambient molecular gas , we use channels of @xmath70 km s@xmath8 in the blueshifted outflow and channels of @xmath71 km s@xmath8 in the redshifted outflow , although channels of 64 and 70 km s@xmath8 show contributions from the outflow ( see figures [ sma12ch ] and [ smacso12ch ] ) .",
    "the area taken into account is defined by a polygon encompassing the outflow structure shown in figure [ flow_int]a .",
    "the dynamical timescale of the outflow is derived following @xmath72 , where @xmath73 pc and @xmath74 km s@xmath8 are the half length of the end - to - end flow extension and the maximum flow velocity relative to @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "consequently the mass loss rate of the outflow can be derived following @xmath75 .",
    "the derived outflow parameters are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "from figure [ flow_int ] , it is evident that one of the three mm continuum cores harbors the driving source of the bipolar outflow . from the maser and cm continuum observations in the literature",
    "@xcite , mm1 roughly coincides with an uc hii region and a h@xmath17o maser ; mm2 is associated with h@xmath17o and oh masers but shows no cm emission down to 0.5 mjy at 6 cm or 2 mjy at 3.6 cm ; mm3 has no apparent signature of active star formation .",
    "the 1.3 mm continuum emission from mm3 appears much weaker than that from mm1 and mm2 , implying a mass significantly less than 10 m@xmath76 .",
    "its relatively faint dust emission and the apparent non - association with active star formation suggest that mm3 does not harbor the driving source of the bipolar outflow . of the remaining two mm cores",
    ", mm2 appears closer to the geometric center of the bipolar outflow , thus is more likely to be the parent core of the outflow driving source .",
    "this is compatible with the relatively short outflow dynamical timescale , @xmath9 yr , in comparison with @xmath77 yr for massive molecular outflows from uc hii regions @xcite .",
    "low - mass molecular outflows are known to exhibit highly collimated jetlike structures and/or wide - angle quasi - conical or quasi - parabolic structures .",
    "it is still unclear whether massive molecular outflows have an essentially similar appearance as low - mass outflows .",
    "high - angular - resolution interferometric observations have resolved a few single - dish bipolar outflows into multiple jetlike outflows , which were suggested as indirect evidence that associated high - mass stars may form via disk accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , very few well - defined wide - angle molecular outflows have been found in high - mass star - forming regions . @xcite",

    "mid - ir imaging of iras 20126 + 4104 and hh 80/81 , but the former is subject to ambiguity about whether it is caused by a precessing jet and the latter lacks kinematical information due to the lack of high - angular - resolution mm line observations .",
    "the g192.16 - 3.82 outflow , originating from an uc hii region , may be representative of a bipolar wide - angle outflow with limb - brightened shells in a @xmath78 l@xmath1 star forming region @xcite .",
    "our observations of the g240 outflow reveal a bipolar wide - angle molecular outflow with a quasi - parabolic shell . to our knowledge",
    "this is hitherto the best case of a well - defined wide - angle molecular outflow in a @xmath14 l@xmath1 star forming region .",
    "the outflow has a morphology similar to protostellar low - mass molecular outflows , e.g. , l1228 outflow @xcite , b335 outflow @xcite .",
    "the behavior of higher collimation at higher velocities is also often seen in low - mass molecular outflows .    given the striking similarity between the g240 outflow and low - mass wide - angle outflows ,",
    "the g240 outflow could be driven by an underlying wide - angle wind , as commonly suggested for low - mass wide - angle outflows .",
    "@xcite argued that neither accumulated stellar winds nor entrained interstellar matter in bipolar jets is able to account for @xmath79 m@xmath1 of gas masses measured in massive molecular outflows typically at @xmath80 yrs old .",
    "it is true that the g240 molecular outflow is unlikely to primarily contain accumulated stellar winds , because stellar winds from ob stars are radiation driven and their momentum supply rates can not be higher than @xmath81 , while the g240 outflow has a mechanical force , @xmath82 , about 25 times higher than @xmath81 .",
    "the mass limit of entrained interstellar matter argued by @xcite was based on the turbulent jet entrainment model @xcite . in this model",
    "a bipolar jet entrains aside interstellar matter through a turbulent mixing layer . because the environment can not react to the rarefaction by the entrainment at velocities faster than the sound speed @xmath83",
    "( typically an order of 1 km s@xmath8 ) , the entrainment rate per unit area is given by @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the entrainment efficiency and @xmath86 the density of the ambient medium .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite proposed an analytical model for bipolar molecular outflows , where an underlying wide - angle wind radially sweeps up ambient gas into an expanding shell to form a molecular outflow .",
    "further analytical calculations and simulations of the model , by adopting an angle - dependent wind blowing into an angle - dependent molecular cloud core , appear generally consistent with observations @xcite . in this model molecular outflows are assumed to be _ momentum driven _ and the entrainment rate per unit area is simply proportional to @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the shell expanding speed ( i.e. , the molecular outflow speed observed in @xmath3co , typically an order of 10 km s@xmath8 ) and determined by the momentum supply rate of the underlying wind .",
    "the mass loading limit in the turbulent entrainment model does not seem to be applicable to the swept - up shell model . even in the turbulent entrainment model , a factor of 10 higher mass loading",
    "could be achieved if the entrainment process works at alfven speeds , which are a factor of 10 higher than @xmath83 , when the magnetic fields are important .",
    "another molecular outflow model that can readily account for high mass loading is the so - called `` circulation model '' @xcite .",
    "molecular outflow materials in this model are those deflected from infalling matter , instead of entrained or swept - up ambient gas by an underlying jet or wind . however , in at least one case , the g192.16 outflow , there is strong evidence for the presence of a wide - angle wind being the driving agent of the wide - angle @xmath3co outflow ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath5 m emission coincident with the g240 @xmath3co outflow lobes shown in figure [ flow_int]d , is likely excited by an underlying fast wind .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the g240 outflow is more likely to be driven / swept - up by an underlying wide - angle wind .",
    "the wind itself might be accretion driven and somewhat analogous to _ x_-wind or disk - wind in low - mass stars @xcite , although it is unknown whether _ x_-wind or disk - wind can be scaled up and applied to high - mass stars .    figure",
    "[ pv ] shows the position - velocity ( pv ) diagram of the g240 @xmath3co outflow cut roughly along the outflow major axis .",
    "the nw redshifted lobe shows a feature extending to @xmath89 from the driving source at a velocity of @xmath90 km s@xmath8 and another feature extending to @xmath91 from the source at a velocity of @xmath92 km s@xmath8 .",
    "connecting these two features following the gradient of the contour levels in figure [ pv ] one can get an approximately parabolic trajectory opening outward from the driving source .",
    "this kind of pv structure is very similar to that of the northern lobe of the vla 05487 outflow , a good example of a wide - angle wind driven low - mass outflow , and can be reasonably reproduced by the hydrodynamic simulation of a modified _ x_-wind model @xcite .",
    "according to the model the pv structure can be qualitatively understood in the context of a radially expanding shell with a hubble - law velocity structure and a moderate inclination angle , where the far - side shell has a smaller projected extension and higher line - of - sight velocities , while the near - side shell has a larger projected extension and lower line - of - sight velocities .",
    "this parabolic pv structure supports the scenario that the g240 molecular outflow is driven by a wide - angle wind .",
    "it is difficult to identify a similar pv structure in the se blueshifted lobe , probably because this lobe is highly asymmetric at most velocities ( the western part of the shell can be only seen at 62 and 64 km s@xmath8 in figure [ sma12ch ] ) and contaminated by a secondary outflow to the west .",
    "its pv structure is dominated by a high velocity feature @xmath93 away from the source , corresponding to a clump shown in figure [ flow_int]b .    while molecular outflows associated with both low- and high - mass ( proto)stars are found to exhibit a `` mass spectrum '' , @xmath94 ,",
    "with the power - law index @xmath95 around 2 for low velocity gas and often steepening at velocities higher than @xmath96 km s@xmath8 , its physical origin is not well established @xcite .",
    "figure [ mv ] shows the mass - velocity diagram of the g240 outflow , where both lobes can be fitted as a broken power - law , with @xmath95 steepening from @xmath97 to @xmath98 at 13.5 km s@xmath8 for the blueshifted lobe and from @xmath99 to @xmath100 at 10.5 km s@xmath8 for the redshifted lobe .",
    "it appears that the g240 outflow has fairly large values of @xmath95 at high velocities , comparable to that of some other @xmath3co outflows associated with both high- and low - mass ( proto)stars @xcite . such large values of @xmath95 have been an unsolved issue to both jet bow - shock and wide - angle wind models since numerical simulations of these models predict @xmath101 ; future simulations that run for flows more than @xmath102 yr old might be able to address whether it can be explained by outflow evolution ( see a review by * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , as shown by colored lines in figure [ mv ] , the mass spectra of high velocity channels of both lobes can be further fitted with a broken power - law rather than a single power - law , and in those narrower velocity ranges @xmath95 steepens from @xmath103 to @xmath104 at 19.5 km s@xmath8 for the blueshifted lobe and from @xmath105 to @xmath106 at 20.5 km s@xmath8 for the redshifted lobe .",
    "this may simply reflect a continuing decrease of mass entrainment efficiency with increasing outflow velocities in this outflow .",
    "the total gas mass of the g240 outflow , estimated based on combined interferometer and single - dish data with sophisticated opacity correction , amounts to 98 m@xmath1 , making it one of the most massive ( proto)stellar outflows known . given the unknown inclination angle of the outflow , the estimated outflow momentum of 620 m@xmath1 km s@xmath8 and energy of @xmath107 erg can be treated as lower limits accordingly . based on a velocity gradient in their cso c@xmath18o ( 21 ) observations and assuming the gas is in virial equilibrium , @xcite derived a gas mass of 625 m@xmath1 . considering",
    "the cloud is likely infalling to feed the accretion onto the central ( proto)stars and thus deviates from virial equilibrium , this estimate may provide a lower limit of the dense cloud mass .",
    "the gravitational binding energy of the cloud , @xmath108 , where @xmath109 pc @xcite , is then @xmath110 erg , which is comparable to the outflow energy ( table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "although there are many uncertainties in calculations of both the gravitational binding energy and the outflow energy , the g240 outflow seems to play a critical role in disrupting or unbinding its host cloud .",
    "the mass loss rate of @xmath111 m@xmath1 yr@xmath8 is about two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of typical low - mass outflows . assuming momentum conservation between the swept - up molecular outflow and an underlying primary wind , i.e. , @xmath112 ( also see eq .",

    "* ) , where @xmath113 , @xmath114 are the wind mass loss rate and wind speed , respectively , and adopting a wind speed of 500 km s@xmath8 , the mass loss rate of the wind amounts to @xmath115 m@xmath1 yr@xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , adopting a ratio of @xmath30 for the wind mass loss rate to mass accretion rate @xcite , we get an accretion rate of @xmath116 m@xmath1 yr@xmath8 , high enough to overcome radiation pressure from the central object to form a high - mass star @xcite . again considering the underestimate to @xmath117 ,",

    "for both lobes the outflow mass - velocity relation can be fitted with broken power - laws with the indices steeping at high velocities .",
    "the outflow has @xmath6 m@xmath1 gas mass and a dynamical timescale of @xmath9 yr , thus a mass loss rate of @xmath7 m@xmath1 yr@xmath8 . without correction for the unknown inclination angle the momentum and energy of the outflow amount to 620 m@xmath1 km s@xmath8 and @xmath107 erg , respectively .",
    "our observations of the g240 outflow reveal a well - defined wide - angle molecular outflow with its morphology and kinematics similar to low - mass molecular outflows , but with two to three orders of magnitude greater mass and energetics suggestive of a high accretion rate .",
    "these findings appear to be consistent with the scenario that high - mass stars of early - b to late - o types can form in a similar way as low - mass star formation , even in a clustering environment .",

    "<S> we present submillimeter array observations toward the @xmath0 l@xmath1 star - forming region g240.31 + 0.07 , in the @xmath21 transition of @xmath3co and @xmath4co and at 1.3 mm continuum , as well as the @xmath3co and @xmath4co observations from the caltech submillimeter observatory to recover the extended emission filtered out by the interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> maps of the @xmath3co and @xmath4co emission show a bipolar , wide - angle , quasi - parabolic molecular outflow , roughly coincident with an ir nebula revealed by the _ spitzer _ 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath5 m emission . </S>",
    "<S> the outflow has @xmath6 m@xmath1 molecular gas , making it one of the most massive molecular outflows known , and resulting in a very high mass - loss rate of @xmath7 m@xmath1yr@xmath8 over a dynamical timescale of @xmath9 yr . </S>",
    "<S> the 1.3 mm continuum observations with a @xmath10 beam reveal a flattened dusty envelope of @xmath11 m@xmath1 , which is further resolved with a @xmath12 beam into three dense cores with a total mass of @xmath13 m@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the central mm core , showing evidence of active star formation , approximately coincides with the geometric center of the bipolar outflow thus most likely harbors the powering source of the outflow . </S>",
    "<S> overall our observations provide the best case to date of a well - defined wide - angle molecular outflow in a @xmath14 l@xmath1 star - forming region . </S>",
    "<S> the outflow is morphologically and kinematically similar to low - mass protostellar outflows but has two to three orders of magnitude greater mass , momentum , and energy , and is apparently driven by an underlying wide - angle wind , hence further supports that high - mass stars up to late - o types , even in a crowded clustering environment , can form as a scaled - up version of low - mass star formation . </S>"
