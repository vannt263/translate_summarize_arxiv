    "the corresponding disk s luminosity is about twice the eddington value .",
    "its far - uv fluxes are well below the observed fluxes .",
    "( ii ) the inverse compton scattering of low energy photons off relativistic electrons can not take place , because the plasma surrounding accreting wds in the symbiotic novae and classical symbiotic stars contains non - relativistic electrons , as is clear from the presence of thomson scattering measured in the strongest emission lines ( e.g. ovi 1032 and 1038  doublet , see * ? ? ?",
    "if there is no other source , which contributes to the far - uv and rivals that from the burning wd , the very high far - uv fluxes ( @xmath108@xmath109 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : seds ] ) require the luminosity of the wd to be significantly above the eddington limit .",
    "this can be probed independently by studying the very high emission from the thermal nebula .",
    "the nebular emission represents a fraction of the stellar radiation from the wd reprocessed via the ionization / recombination and bremsstrahlung events .",
    "therefore , its source can be associated with the material surrounding the burning wd .",
    "the quantity of the nebular emission was determined by the model sed and its extent was revealed by direct imaging @xcite . at day 55 , i.e. simultaneously with our second set of observations ( table  1 ) , @xcite observed rs  oph with the very large array ( vla ) at 43ghz .",
    "they showed that the image emission is consistent with thermal bremsstrahlung emission from a lower temperature plasma heated by photoionizations .",
    "i used the image and the corresponding flux to estimate the volume of the emitting material and its average particle density , and test whether these parameters are consistent with the high wd s luminosity suggested by the model sed .      here",
    "i assume that the emitting material that is imaged at 43ghz produces the nebular radiation we measure at uv  ir wavelengths .",
    "first , approximating the shape of the vla image by a prolate spheroid with an axis @xmath110  mas = 71@xmath111au and @xmath112  mas = 28@xmath111au , one obtains the volume of the main emission region , @xmath113@xmath114 . the emission measure observed at day 55 , _ _",
    "em__@xmath115@xmath116 , then yields an average particle density of this region , @xmath117@xmath116 .",
    "these quantities correspond to an emitting mass of the nebula @xmath118 @xmath119@xmath4 , where @xmath120 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath121 is the mass of the hydrogen atom .",
    "second , using the measured flux at 43ghz , @xmath122mjy @xcite , it is possible to verify results obtained from the image extension . assuming that the plasma is optically thick at 43ghz , and radiates under conditions of thermodynamical equilibrium , the nebula resembles a blackbody at temperature @xmath123",
    "then , using the rayleigh - jeans approximation ( @xmath124 , and no reddening applied ) , the angular radius of the nebula can be expressed as @xmath125 where the filling factor @xmath126 reduces the measured @xmath127 flux to a value produced only by the optically thick part of the nebula at 43ghz .",
    "thus , @xmath128 yields a maximum effective radius of the nebula , @xmath129 cm , which corresponds to a spherical volume , @xmath130@xmath114 . for @xmath131",
    "both volumes are equal , @xmath132 .",
    "their comparability verifies the above adopted assumptions .",
    "the optical depth for such an extended and dense nebula is as large as a few hundred at 43ghz ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the optically thick case for the rs  oph remnant in the radio is demonstrated directly by the x - ray ",
    "radio sed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : xradio ] ) .",

    "third , amount of the emitting mass can be proved independently by the hydrogen recombination lines , which are produced by the same volume of the nebula as the continuum .",
    "for example , using the h@xmath136-line flux method ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the observed flux in the h@xmath136  line , @xmath137 , is produced by the ionized mass @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the volume emission coefficient in the h@xmath136  line .",
    "@xcite analyzed the profile of a strong h@xmath136  line taken at day 57 ( see their fig .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ma - neb ] ) , its integrated flux , @xmath140@xmath141 , implies an emitting mass @xmath142@xmath4   for @xmath143@xmath116 , as derived above from the nebular continuum .",
    "the volume emission coefficient @xmath144 @xmath145 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the range of @xmath146 values represents rather a lower limit , because the densest central part of the nebula , which contributes mainly to the line core , can be optically thick .",
    "i conclude that : ( i ) the large quantity of _ em _ derived from the sed , ( ii ) the volume and the flux of the emitting region measured by the vla , and ( iii ) the strong flux in the h@xmath136  line from the optical spectrum , all correspond to a high mass of the nebular emitting material , @xmath147@xmath4 , which surrounds the burning wd even during the sss phase of its outbursts .",
    "\\(i ) the nebular emission can be created only within the ionized part of the material surrounding the ionizing source .",
    "its extent is limited by the distance from the wd s photosphere , at which the flux of its ionizing photons is balanced by the rate of ionization / recombination events inside the nebula .",

    "the eddington luminosity of the burning wd ( 44000@xmath26  for @xmath155@xmath4 ) radiating at @xmath156k @xcite corresponds to @xmath157s@xmath158",

    "this implies that @xmath166 to increase @xmath150 and thus @xmath148 .",
    "\\(ii ) a lower limit of the wd luminosity can be estimated from the nebular component of radiation , which represents a fraction of the ionizing source radiation reprocessed by the thermal nebula via the ionization / recombination events .",
    "if _ all _ the ionizing photons are converted into the nebular radiation , then the _ lower _ limit of the wd luminosity , which is capable of producing the observed _ em _ , can be expressed as ( see appendix  a of paper  ii ) ,    @xmath167    where the function @xmath168 equation  ( [ eq : lmin ] ) is valid for the hydrogen plasma , heated by photoionizations , and characterized with a constant @xmath123 and @xmath154 . thus , the _ em _ constrains a minimum luminosity of the ionizing source as a function of its temperature .",

    "the minimum occurs at @xmath170k , at which the source produces a maximum @xmath150 .",

    "figure  [ fig : lmin ] thus demonstrates that the high quantity of the _ em _ constrains @xmath173 for the temperatures given by model seds .",
    "it also shows that the parameters of the sss , as derived from the x - ray - data models ( @xmath174k , @xmath175 , sect .",
    "4.1 ) , are not consistent with the observed amount of nebular emission .",
    "the values of _ em _ require @xmath176k ) = 27@xmath177 ( see the intersection of the gray array with the dashed lines in fig .",

    "in addition , a fraction of the ionizing photons can escape the star without being converted into the nebular radiation , and also the measured _ em _ represents a lower limit of what was originally created by ionizations , because we observe only the optically thin part of the nebula . under these circumstances",
    "the flux of ionizing photons , originally emitted by the star , is larger than that given by the equilibrium condition .",
    "this implies @xmath178 ( see appendix  a of paper  ii in detail ) . in this way",
    "the large value of the _ em _ justifies independently the wd s super - eddington luminosity derived from the multiwavelength model seds , even during the sss phase .",

    "figure  [ fig : seds ] shows that the optical @xmath179 region is dominated by the nebular continuum during this phase .",
    "a relatively slow decrease of the optical light thus reflects a relatively slow decrease in the _ em_.",

    "<S> i modelled the 1437@xmath0 m sed of the recurrent symbiotic nova rs  oph during its supersoft source ( sss ) phase and the following quiescent phase . during the sss phase , the model seds revealed the presence of a strong stellar and nebular component of radiation in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the former was emitted by the burning wd at highly super - eddington rate , while the latter represented a fraction of its radiation reprocessed by the thermal nebula . during the transition phase , </S>",
    "<S> both the components were decreasing and during quiescence the sed satisfied radiation produced by a large , optically thick disk ( @xmath1@xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the super - eddington luminosity of the burning wd during the sss phase was independently justified by the high quantity of the nebular emission . </S>",
    "<S> the emitting material surrounded the burning wd , and its mass was @xmath3@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the helium ash , deposited on the wd surface during the whole burning period , was around of @xmath5@xmath4 , which yields an average growing rate of the wd mass , @xmath6@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the mass accreted by the wd between outbursts , @xmath8@xmath4 , constrains the average accretion rate , @xmath9@xmath7 . during quiescence , </S>",
    "<S> the accretion rate from the model sed of @xmath10@xmath7  requires a super - eddington accretion from the disk at @xmath11@xmath7  during the outburst . </S>",
    "<S> such a high accretion can be responsible for the super - eddington luminosity during the whole burning phase . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneous presence of jets supports this scenario . </S>",
    "<S> if the wind from the giant is not sufficient to feed the wd at the required rate , the accretion can be realized from the disk - like reservoir of material around the wd . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the time between outbursts will extend , with the next explosion beyond 2027 . in the opposite case , </S>",
    "<S> the wind from the giant has to be focused to the orbital plane to sustain the high accretion rate at a few @xmath12@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> then the next explosion can occur even prior to 2027 .     </S>",
