    "many blazar - type active galaxies have recently been detected in mev - gev @xmath0-rays by detectors on the board of compton gro ( von montigny et al .",
    "mrk 421 , mrk 501 , and 1e2344 are observed in the tev @xmath0-rays ( punch et al .",
    "1992 , quinn et al .  1996 , catanese et al .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission of blazars is highly variable on different time scales ( from months and weeks up to a fraction of an hour , e.g. gaidos et al .",
    "1996 , mattox et al .",
    "the spectra of fsrq blazars are well described by a power - law with a spectral break from the lower energy part observed in a few sources ( mcnaron - brawn et al .",
    "1995 , schnfelder et al .",
    "1996 ) , and possibly a cut - off at higher energies ( pohl et al .",
    "the spectra of two bl lacs , mrk 421 and mrk 501 , extend up to at least @xmath7 tev ( krennrich et al .",
    "1997 , aharonian et al .",
    "there is also weak evidence of emission of @xmath8 tev photons from some nearby bl lacs ( mayer & westerhoff 1996 ) .",
    "these observations are usually interpreted in terms of the inverse compton scattering model .",
    "this model has been discussed previously in many different geometrical scenarios ( see for example reviews by dermer & schlickeiser 1992 , sikora 1994 , dermer & gehrels 1995 , schlickeiser 1996 , bednarek 1998 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-rays can be also produced in collisions of very high - energy hadrons with soft radiation ( e.g. sikora et al .",
    "this mechanism is discussed in the context of @xmath0-ray production in blazars by e.g. mannheim & biermann ( 1992 ) , coppi , kartje , knigl  ( 1993 ) , protheroe ( 1997 ) , bednarek & protheroe ( 1997 ) .",
    "the interaction of hadronic jets with background matter in agns as a possible source of @xmath0-rays has been problematic because of the difficulty of finding a dense enough target . in principle , such a target might be created either by the matter of a thin accretion disk ( nellen et al .",
    "1993 ) or by the matter in a corona of a thick accretion disk ( bednarek 1993 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission observed from blazars might originate in hadronic collisions of a highly collimated proton beam with clouds entering the jet .",
    "this model , recently proposed by dar & laor ( 1997 ) , is similar to the scenario developed by rose et al .",
    "( 1984 , 1987 ) .    in the broad line region ( blr ) ,",
    "the typical dimensions of clouds are of order @xmath9 cm with cloud densities @xmath10 @xmath11 . for these parameters ,",
    "the hadronic collisions occur frequently enough to produce the observed fluxes of @xmath0-rays",
    ".    however , collisionless processes principally driven by the two - stream instability ( scott , et al .",
    "1980 , rose et al .",
    "1984 , 1987 ) can be the dominant energy loss mechanism for such jets in parameter ranges associated with the blr and nlr ( beall 1990 ) .",
    "the computations by dar and laor do not take into account these collisionless energy losses as the jet propagates through the dense , hot medium of the cloud .",
    "where collisionless energy losses are significant , propagation lengths are markedly shortened .",
    "this is especially true for electron - proton beams with relatively low lorentz factors ( see rose et al .",
    "1984 , and beall 1990 ) .",
    "these effects must be taken into account when calculating the @xmath0-ray emission from the jet .",
    "the radiation emitted by a relativistic electron - proton beam interacting with an ambient medium such as a broad line cloud has been previously discussed in general terms by rose et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and beall et al .",
    "( 1987 ) . in this paper",
    "the predictions of the model wherein an electron - proton beam interacts with an interstellar cloud are compared with the results of @xmath0-ray observations of mrk 421 in a high and low states .",
    "we extend the results of the recent discussion of this model by dar & laor ( 1997 ) to take into account the influence of collisionless losses on the electron - proton jet s @xmath0-rays spectra .",
    "rose et al .",
    "( 1984 , 1987 ) first suggested that the interaction of relativistic particles with dense , interstellar clouds could account for the variability and flux of the hard x - ray and @xmath0-ray sources in active galaxies , and discussed in detail the mechanisms of energy loss for a relativistic , low - density beam of electrons , electrons and positrons , or electrons and protons as it interacts with clouds in the blr and nlr of agn .",
    "as the beam of relativistic particles deposits energy in the ambient medium via the generation of electrostatic plasma waves , a number of important physical processes are operant .",
    "the material in the jet cone or cylinder suffers periodic acceleration as the two - stream instability generates regions of high electric field intensity which then further  sweep out \" electrons ( and eventually background atoms ) from the region where the high electric fields are generated .",
    "these  cavitons \" are low - density , microscopic structures that have a net motion with respect to the ambient medium . during the time when they form , evolve , and then collapse ( much like a wave breaking on a shore ) , they transfer momentum to the ambient medium in the direction of the jet s motion .",
    "in addition to the transfer of momentum to the ambient medium by the net motion of the electric fields in the cavitons , a high - frequency component of the caviton electric field interacts with electrons in the ambient medium in a manner that evolves the maxwell - boltzmann distribution of the gas , producing a high - energy tail . this high - energy tail is a remarkably efficient mechanism for ionizing the gas in the broad and narrow line regions of agn ( beall and guillory , 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , the high - energy tail on the maxwell - boltzmann distribution can decrease the growth rate of the parameteric ( oscillating two - stream ) instability ( freund , smith , papadopoulos , and palmadesso 1981 ) and thus effects the heating rate of the beam upon the plasma , and the cooling rate via inelastic processes and radiation transport .    in order to calculate the propagation length of the electron - proton jet described above",
    ", we model the interaction of the relativistic jet with the ambient medium through which it propagates by means of a set of coupled , partial differential equations which describe the growth , saturation , and decay of the three wave modes likely to be produced by the jet - medium interaction .",
    "first , two - stream instability produces a plasma wave , @xmath12 , called the resonant wave , which grows initially at a rate @xmath13 , where @xmath0 is the lorentz factor of the beam , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the beam and cloud number densities , respectively , and @xmath16 is the plasma frequency , as described more fully in rose et al .",
    "secondly , a parametric instability fed by this wave generates high - frequency components to the electrostatic waves in the plasma .",
    "these high - frequency components we designate as @xmath17 . finally , the interaction of these waves with one another and with the ions in the ambient medium generate ion - acoustic waves , which we designate as @xmath18 .",
    "such a treatment of the process considered herein does not of course provide a self - consistent calculation of the deposition of the beam energy into the plasma .",
    "it does , however , provide a reasonable estimate of the magnitude of the effects of the interaction of the relativistic jet with the ambient medium .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the considerations leading to these rate equations can be found in scott et al.(1981 ) , rose et al.(1984 , 1987 ) , and beall et al.(1986 , 1990 ) .",
    "the results of these estimates have been substantially confirmed by a particle - in - cell code ( pic - code ) calculation ( rose et al .",
    "1998 , beall et al .  1997 ) .",
    "the introduction of a weak , longitudinal magnetic field tends to stabilize the beam and increase its propagation length somewhat .",
    "the time - dependent values of the normalized wave energy densities for the two - stream instability , @xmath12 , the oscillating two - stream instability , @xmath17 , and the ion - acoustic waves , @xmath18 , and the shortest time scale for the growth of the instabilities , t , determine the rate at which energy is drawn from the relativistic beam into the ambient medium .",
    "we note that @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the initial growth rate of the two - stream instability wave energies .",
    "these solutions represent a spatial average of the energy density for the waves in the plasma .",
    "as a beam excites waves in traversing a background plasma , it loses energy and @xmath0 decreases . for an electron - proton beam",
    "the principal collisionless interaction is between the beam electrons and background plasma .",
    "consequently , the beam electrons will tend to slow down with respect to the beam protons .",
    "if the beam - plasma interaction is not very strong , the beam protons will drag the electrons along with them .    for a relativistic beam @xmath21 and",
    "the energy loss through a distance @xmath22 can be estimated as follows .",
    "let    @xmath23    where @xmath24 for an electron beam , @xmath24 for an electron - positron beam , @xmath25 for an electron - proton beam , @xmath26 is the energy density of the resonant waves , and @xmath27 is a factor ( @xmath281 ) that corrects for the simultaneous transfer of resonant wave energy into nonresonant wave energy @xmath29 and ion - acoustic wave energy @xmath30 . from equation 1",
    ", we find    @xmath31/(v_{b}n_{b}m^{'}c^{2})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this equation can be compared directly with the equations for the individual particle energy loss mechanisms ( beall 1990 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath32 , and that the @xmath33 is the cycle time between periods in the oscillatory solutions to the equations , or , for the steady state solutions , roughly @xmath34 .",
    "the two time intervals are approximately equal .    given these considerations , the propagation length",
    "lp [ i.e. , the distance over which @xmath35 decreases by a factor of @xmath36 becomes    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the time average rate of excitation of wave energy density , can be obtained from the solutions described below .",
    "figure 1 shows the dependence of propagation length , @xmath39 , vs. @xmath40 for a range of parameters appropriate for the blr of agn .",
    "it is plausible that highly collimated , relativistic proton beams can be accelerated in the strong electric fields created by a black hole or an accretion disk rotating in the perpendicular magnetic field ( see e.g. blandford & znajek 1977 , lovelace 1976 , blandford 1976 ) , or during magnetic reconnection occurring in the jet or on the surface of an accretion disk ( e.g. romanova & lovelace 1992 , haswell et al . 1992 ) . in the second scenario",
    "both electron and proton beams can be formed in multiple reconnection events occurring at this same time on the inner part of an accretion disk .",
    "unfortunately , there is at present no theory which is able to predict the spectrum of particles accelerated via such magnetic reconnections",
    ".    the spectrum of protons injected from the single reconnection region might be close to monoenergetic , if all particles pass through this same electric field potential , or it might resemble a power law if the escape of particles from the reconnection region is stochastic ( colgate 1995 ) .",
    "even if the proton spectrum from a single reconnection region is monoenergetic , the total spectrum summed up over many reconnection regions might resemble a power law .",
    "therefore it seems reasonable to consider a power law spectrum of the proton beam , as dar & laor ( 1997 ) have done .",
    "the electron - proton ( e - p ) beams , propagating in the surroundings of active galaxy , suffers energy losses via collisionless excitation of plasma waves ( op.cit . ) and through hadronic collisions with matter . in hadronic collisions ,",
    "neutral and changed pions are created .",
    "these decay to electrons and positrons , @xmath0-rays and neutrinos .",
    "electrons and positrons can later lose energy on bremsstrahlung , inverse compton scattering and synchrotron processes .",
    "we compute the spectra of @xmath0-rays from decay of neutral pions produced in the interaction of such a proton beam with a cloud which enters the jet . during propagation through the cloud",
    ", the e - p beam lorentz factor @xmath40 changes as a result of collisionless energy losses according to    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the propagation distance in the cloud , @xmath43 is the initial lorentz factor of e - p beam .",
    "the differential @xmath0-ray spectrum from interaction of e - p beam with a single cloud can be obtained from @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the differential density of relativistic protons ( per energy and volume ) which is assumed to be a power law type with the index @xmath27 and normalization @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the differential @xmath0-ray photon spectrum produced per unit time by monoenergetic protons with energy @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the maximum propagation distance in the cloud , and @xmath50 is the proton rest mass . in computations of these spectra the scaling model has been used ( stephens & badhwar 1981 ) which gives a good approximation for the p - p cross section in the proton energy range considered .",
    "the computations of the @xmath0-ray spectra have been done for different initial spectra of proton beam defined by @xmath27 and @xmath46 . in fig .",
    "2 we show such @xmath0-ray spectra , multiplied by the square of photon energy and divided by the propagation distance @xmath49 in the cloud , for @xmath51 ( figs .",
    "2a , b , c ) and @xmath52 ( figs .",
    "2d , e , f ) , for different normalizations @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "different curves show the @xmath0-ray spectra for different propagation distances of the proton beam in the cloud , and the dotted curve shows the @xmath0-ray spectrum in the absence of collisionless losses .",
    "the beam power for the applied proton spectrum is comparable to the expected jet power in agn .",
    "for example , if the jet radius is @xmath55 cm @xmath56 , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 , then the proton beam power is @xmath59 erg s@xmath60 , for @xmath61 gev .",
    "since the parameters of the cloud determine the propagation distance of the proton beam , the @xmath0-ray spectra are computed for the cloud densities @xmath62 @xmath11 , and @xmath63 @xmath11 , and temperatures @xmath64 k , and @xmath65 k. such cloud parameters are expected in the broad line regions of agns ( dar & laor 1997 ) . for the range of investigated parameters ,",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectra show a characteristic break located between @xmath66 gev .",
    "mrk 421 shows strong flares observed simultaneously in tev and x - ray energy range on time scales from days up to 15 min ( e.g. buckley et al .",
    "1996 , gaidos et al .",
    "the spectrum observed by the whipple observatory during a strong flare on may 7 1996 has the spectral index @xmath67 between 0.3 - 10 tev ( mcenery et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the spectrum of mrk 421 observed during low tev state by the egret telescope between 100 mev and a few gev has the spectral index @xmath68 ( lin et al .",
    "this spectrum does not change significantly between the low and high tev states ( buckley et al .",
    "similar flaring behavior is also observed in the case of mrk 501 in the tev energy range ( see the review by protheroe et al .",
    "1997 ) , and in x - rays ( catanese et al .",
    "1997b , pian et al . 1998 ) .",
    "below we discuss the expected radiation signatures from the proton - cloud interaction model in the context of these observations .",
    "the existence of a break in the @xmath0-ray spectra of two bl lacs ( mrk 421 and mrk 501 ) observed in tev energy range is at present very clear .",
    "the relativistic proton beam model with a single power law spectrum is able to explain this feature quite naturally .    in order to find out if the model is able to explain the shape of the @xmath0-ray spectrum observed from mrk 421 in the tev and gev energy range , we compare in fig .",
    "3 the results of observations with the expected emission from the beam - cloud collision model .",
    "we assume that the strong variability of the tev emission is caused by the proton beam propagating through regions of cloud(s ) with different thickness @xmath49 .",
    "the much lower variability of the mev - gev @xmath0-ray flux is generally consistent with the expectations of proton beam model .",
    "the computed spectra also show a break between the gev and tev energy range , consistent with the observations of mrk 421 and mrk 501 .",
    "this break is caused by the collisionless losses of the e - p beam .",
    "however if the computed spectrum is normalized to the spectrum observed in the tev energies , then the predicted gev spectrum is significantly flatter , being inconsistent with the spectral index in the gev energies observed by egret ( lin et al .",
    "1994 , buckley et al .",
    "therefore the @xmath0-rays produced from decay of neutral pions can not by themselves be used to explain the weakly variable gev emission observed from mrk 421 unless the spectrum of protons in the beam show strong steepening below @xmath7 gev .",
    "contributions from another source of @xmath0-rays to the gev energy range is needed at least at energies below @xmath70 gev . in the next subsection",
    "we discuss contributions to the emitted radiation from secondary @xmath71 pairs .",
    "if jet - cloud model is valid for the @xmath0-ray production in mrk 421 , then the secondary @xmath71 pairs from decay of charged pions should have a spectrum very similar to the @xmath0-ray spectrum from @xmath73 decay , but shifted to lower energies by a factor of two .",
    "let us assume , following dar & laor ( 1997 ) , that these secondary @xmath71 pairs are responsible for the production of synchrotron emission during the outburst in mrk 421 .",
    "in fact the equilibrium spectra of secondary @xmath71 pairs are consistent with the synchrotron spectrum observed from mrk 421 in a high state .",
    "the break in the spectrum of secondary pairs at @xmath74 should correspond to the break in the synchrotron spectrum which is observed in mrk 421 at @xmath75 kev ( takahashi et al .",
    "the relation between these breaks allows us to estimate the strength of the magnetic field in the region of production of synchrotron photons from    @xmath76    where @xmath77 gs , and @xmath78 is the electron rest mass . for the value @xmath79 gev ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , the magnetic field in the emitting region should be equal to @xmath80 g. the characteristic cooling time of secondary pairs with energies mensioned above in such a magnetic field is of the order of @xmath81 s which is consistent with the time scale of outbursts in mrk 421 .",
    "the x - ray and @xmath0-ray flares have similar powers in mrk 421 .",
    "therefore the secondary pairs must move almost ballistically through the cloud , e.g. by following the highly ordered magnetic field lines along the jet axis .",
    "the pairs move through the dense cloud during the characteristic time @xmath82 which is comparable to their characteristic synchrotron cooling time estimated below .",
    "therefore , the observed synchrotron emission is produced close to the cloud and should be synchronized with the tev @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "the comparison of synchrotron and bremsstrahlung cooling times of secondary @xmath71 pairs shows that bremsstrahlung dominates for @xmath71 pairs with lorentz factors    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the density of the background matter . for the value of the magnetic field",
    "estimated above , and considered cloud density @xmath85 @xmath11 , we get @xmath86",
    ". however the pairs travel through the cloud during the time @xmath87 , which is shorter than their cooling time via bremsstrahlung : @xmath88 s. hence we conclude that secondary @xmath71 pairs , with lorentz factors @xmath89 , have no time to cool by a bremsstrahlung process in the cloud .",
    "this process can not , therefore , contribute essentially to the mrk 421 spectrum in the mev - gev energy range .",
    "the contribution to the @xmath0-ray spectrum from inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of soft photons by secondary pairs is very uncertain because of the lack of precise information on the soft photon geometry and density in the emission region .",
    "the observations of mrk 421 by the egret and asca telescopes allow us to estimate the ratio of the power emitted in mev - gev @xmath0-rays and x - rays , which is close to 0.5 ( see von montigny et al .",
    "1995 , takahashi et al .",
    "therefore if ics of secondary pairs contributes significantly to the egret energy range , the energy densities of the magnetic field and the low - energy radiation in the region of the propagation of the secondary pairs has to be in a similar ratio , provided that the scattering occurs in the thomson regime .",
    "the energy density of the magnetic field in the emission region of mrk 421 ( see above ) requires that the energy density of soft photons should be @xmath90 ev @xmath11 .",
    "three different sources of soft photons can provide , in principle , a target for these secondary pairs , i.e. soft synchrotron photons , thermal photons coming directly from an accretion disk , or thermal bremsstrahlung photons produced in the cloud .",
    "two first possibilities can be excluded based on following arguments .",
    "let us assume that the stable flux of @xmath0-rays in the 100 mev - 1 gev energy range is produced by ics in the thomson regime .",
    "the scattering in the klein - nishina regime reduces the efficiency of the process and produces too steep a spectrum .",
    "the part of the spectrum of secondary pairs below @xmath7 gev does not vary strongly ( see figs .  3 ) .",
    "however , these pairs can produce 100 mev - 1 gev @xmath0-rays by scattering synchrotron x - ray photons , which are highly variable .",
    "therefore the flux of @xmath0-rays in the egret energy range should vary significantly between the low and high tev state , which is in contradiction with the observations ( lin et al .",
    "1994 , buckley et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the flux of secondary pairs with energies above @xmath7 gev is highly variable and can not produce egret @xmath0-rays by scattering weakly variable optical - uv photons of synchrotron origin , or produced in the low temperature optically thick accretion disk .",
    "the density of thermal bremsstrahlung photons produced in the cloud can be estimated from @xmath91 however these photons have characteristic energies @xmath92 ev .",
    "hence they require electrons with lorentz factors @xmath93 in order to produce 1 gev @xmath0-rays in ics process .",
    "secondary pairs with these energies show already high level of variability between low and high states of mrk 421 , and therefore should produce strongly variable gev emission which is in contrary to observations .",
    "the only possibility left is that the secondary pairs with energies below @xmath7 gev scatter non - variable radiation with characteristic energies of @xmath94 kev of another origin ( e.g. , produced in the high temperature disk or the disk corona ) .",
    "however , this radiation field has to be transparent to the observed @xmath0-rays .",
    "the optical depth for the gev @xmath0-rays is less than one if the characteristic dimension of this x - ray region is    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the maximum value of the photon - photon pair production cross section and applying @xmath97 kev .",
    "this radiation might eventually originate in the inner part of the accretion disk or the disk corona or might be produced by the low density but high temperature plazma surrounding small and dense clouds which are considered here as a target for relativistic proton beam .",
    "however the above constraint on the dimension of this region rather exclude the last possibility .",
    "if the relativistic electron - proton beam collides with a dense , compact cloud , the energy losses of the jet via the excitation of plasma waves ( rose et al 1984 ) becomes important for beams with energies below @xmath98 gev ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this process causes the break in the spectrum of @xmath0-rays from the decay of neutral pions that are produced in inelastic collisions of protons with matter .",
    "such a model can naturally explain the low and high states of tev @xmath0-ray emission in bl lac type blazars , provided that the proton beam interacts with different column densities of matter .",
    "moreover , because of the collisionless energy losses of the proton beam , the @xmath0-ray spectrum predicted in the 100 mev - 1 gev energy range does not vary strongly .",
    "this features fits nicely to the general behavior of the @xmath0-ray emission from mrk 421 between low and high states .",
    "however the @xmath0-ray spectra computed in the 100 mev - 1 gev energy range for reasonable sets of model parameters are too flat , showing significant deficiency in comparison to the mrk 421 spectrum observed by egret ( fig .",
    "3 ) provided that the spectrum of relativistic protons in the beam is well described by a single power law .",
    "secondary @xmath71 pairs are also produced in hadronic collisions through decay of charged pions , with the spectra similar to the @xmath0-ray spectra but shifted to lower energies .",
    "the higher energy , variable part of the spectrum of secondary pairs ( with energies above @xmath7 gev ) can be responsible for the simultaneous x - ray flares .",
    "such a picture could work provided that the clouds are not too hot .",
    "otherwise the tev @xmath0-rays are absorbed by the thermal bremsstrahlung photons produced in the cloud ( see computations of the @xmath0-ray mean free paths on fig .  3 in beall et al .",
    "the clouds also can not be too dense . by reversing eq .",
    "( 9 ) , we see that if the cloud density is @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the column density of matter traversed by the proton beam in the cloud , then the secondary electrons are not able to lose energy efficiently by the synchrotron process because of dominant role of ics losses on thermal bremsstrahlung radiation produced in the cloud .",
    "the relation of the break in the spectrum of secondary pairs to the break in the x - ray spectrum observed in mrk 421 allows a derivation of the strength of the magnetic field in the emission region equal to @xmath101 g ( eq .  3 ) .",
    "these pairs can not contribute to the egret energy range : by production of @xmath0-rays in a bremsstrahlung process ; or by inverse - compton scattering of soft photons of synchrotron origin , or coming from the optically thick , low temperature accretion disk , or bremsstrahlung photons produced in the cloud .",
    "only the scattering of non - variable , soft x - ray photons ( @xmath102 kev ) by secondary pairs with energies below @xmath7 gev could explain the non - variable @xmath0-ray emission from mrk 421 in the egret energy range .",
    "these photons could be produced in the inner part of the accretion disk .",

    "<S> we consider , herein , a model for @xmath0-ray production in blazars in which a relativistic , highly - collimated electron - proton beam interacts with a dense , compact cloud as the jet propagates through the broad and perhaps narrow line regions ( blr and nlr ) of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . during the propagation of the beam through the cloud , the process of excitation of plasma waves becomes an important energy loss mechanism , especially for mildly relativistic proton beams . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the expected spectra of @xmath0-rays from the decay of neutral pions produced in hadronic collisions of the beam with the cloud , taking into account collisionless losses of the electron - proton beam . </S>",
    "<S> this model may explain the x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray ( both low and high emission states ) of mrk 421 as a result of synchrotron emission of secondary pairs from the decay of charged pions and @xmath0-ray emission from the decay of neutral pions for the plausible cloud parameters . </S>",
    "<S> however clouds can not be too hot and too dense . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise the tev @xmath0-rays can be attenuated by the bremsstrahlung radiation in the cloud and the secondary pairs are not able to efficiently produce synchrotron flares because of the dominant role of inverse compton scattering .    the non - variable @xmath0-ray emission observed from mrk 421 in the egret energy range can not be described by the @xmath0-rays from decay of neutral pions provided that the spectrum of protons in the beam is well described by a simple power law . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath0-rays might only be produced by secondary pairs scattering the soft non - variable x - rays which might originate in the inner part of the accretion disk .    </S>",
