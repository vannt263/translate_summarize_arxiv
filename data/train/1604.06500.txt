    "+ various models of describing the coagulation and fragmentation of groups of animals have been suggested and analysed in the past ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) . the model this work rests upon",
    "was introduced by hiro - sato niwa in 2003 @xcite related to studies in @xcite and has turned out to hold for data from pelagic fish and mammalian herbivores in the wild .",
    "the model can be formalized into coagulation - fragmentation integral equations where the coagulation rate is a constant independent from the group sizes and the fragmentation rate is also a constant independent from the fragment . by analogy with an it",
    "stochastic differential equation niwa shows that the equilibrium must be given by @xmath2.\\ ] ] @xmath3 is the stationary probability density function of group sizes and @xmath4 is the average of the population distribution among group sizes , i.e. the expected size of the groups which an arbitrary individual is part of . for a continuum of cluster sizes ,",
    "this is defined as @xmath5 in the discrete setting the integrals are replaced by sums .",
    "+ in @xcite niwa shows that the proposed equilibrium distribution ( [ niwaequi ] ) matches empirical data of several species of pelagic fish very well .",
    "@xcite provide a critical discussion of niwa s result and point out some obscurities in the analysis . due to the appealing simplicity of niwa s model and the good empirical match to the data ,",
    "mathematical clarification is important .",
    "degond et al .",
    "@xcite have pursued with niwa s model and given a rigorous description of the equilibria for continuous ( model c ) and discrete ( model d ) cluster sizes , which differ from ( [ niwaequi ] ) .",
    "the lack of a detailed balanced condition has made the analysis difficult .",
    "however , by introducing the so called bernstein transformation , they have shown that there exists a unique equilibrium , under a suitable normalization condition , for both the discrete and the continuous cluster size case .",
    "+ the task of the present work is a numerical investigation of both models and their equilibria .",
    "the continuous equilibrium is approximated numerically using three different methods whose accuracy will be examined .",
    "one of them is a recursive algorithm derived from model d in @xcite which enables a transition from the discrete to the continuous equilibrium .",
    "the other two , a newton and a time - dependent method , operate within a discretized truncated model , denoted by d , of the continuous model c. there is an abundant amount of literature about discretizations of coagulation ( and fragmentation ) integral equations using finite volume methods ( e.g. @xcite ) or finite element methods ( e.g. @xcite ) . in our case , the discretization scheme is already predetermined by model d. + it is investigated how well the numerically generated equilibria match the analytically predicted decay rate and the small - size asymptotic behaviour of the model c equilibrium .",
    "we find all three methods to be very accurate apart from small deviations of the large - size behaviour in the case of the newton and the time - dependent method due to truncation .",
    "the newton method turns out to be extremely fast , providing a very close approximation of the equilibrium after five iterations .",
    "the recursive algorithm is the best numerical approach to this particular model with respect to a couple of aspects : it is numerically cheap , does nt require truncation , is completely accurate for the discrete model d and approximates the continuous case properly without any aberrations .",
    "however , the other two methods are far more flexible regarding changes of the models since , in principal , they do nt require constant coagulation - fragmentation parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 as opposed to the recursive algorithm .",
    "the newton scheme as an approach to prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium , as introduced in this work for model c , has the advantage of not depending on fixed parameters as contrasted with the bernstein method ( see @xcite ) which needs @xmath6 and @xmath7 to be equal to one .",
    "+ hence , the truncated model and the associated numerical methods provide the tools to work in more sophisticated models with the coagulation and fragmentation depending on the group sizes and/or time . in this context",
    ", the model under investigation serves as a toy model to show the accuracy of the suggested schemes .",
    "in addition to that , the euler scheme helps to examine the convergence of time - dependent solutions to the stationary one , something that hasnt been understood comprehensively in the analysis in @xcite .",
    "the numerical approach indicates uniform convergence on finite intervals with super - exponential convergence rates independent from the group sizes .",

    "<S> all three schemes are validated by showing that they approximate the predicted small and large size asymptotic behaviour of the equilibrium accurately . </S>",
    "<S> the recursive algorithm is used to investigate the transition from discrete to continuous size distributions and the time evolution scheme is exploited to show uniform convergence to equilibrium in time and to determine convergence rates .    </S>",
