    "_ taxis _ , the physical migration towards preferred or away from undesired conditions , is a feature shared by virtually all motile organisms .",
    "taxis comes in many forms , and in common is an underlying field of attractant ( or repellent ) and an ability to react and navigate along gradients of this field .",
    "for example , bacteria do _",
    "chemotaxis _ towards nutrients @xcite and away from toxins @xcite .",
    "algae do _ phototaxis _ towards light @xcite and _ gyrotaxis _ along gravitational potentials @xcite .",
    "chemotaxis provides a mechanism for the recognition and attraction of gametes @xcite and for complex behavioural patterns such as in the slime mould _ dictyostelium discoideum _ , where camp - driven chemotaxis is a critical part of the formation of the multicellular stage of the life cycle @xcite .",
    "aerotaxis , defined as oxygen - dependent migration , is well - characterized in bacteria @xcite , but is poorly studied in more complex organisms .",
    "this is despite the essentiality of oxygen for all aerobic life , and the important role that precambrian oxygen levels played in the emergence and evolution of multicellular animal life @xcite .",
    "one group of aquatic heterotrophic protists , the choanoflagellates , are of particular interest for the study of how multicellularity evolved .",
    "choanoflagellates are a class of unicellular microorganisms that are the closest relatives of the animals @xcite .",
    "this relationship was first proposed by james - clark in 1866 @xcite , on the basis of the resemblance between choanoflagellates and the choanocytes of sponges .",
    "the sister relationship between choanoflagellates and animals was further confirmed in the genomic era by molecular evidence @xcite .",
    "all choanoflagellates share the same basic unicell structure : a prolate cell body with a single beating flagellum that is surrounded by a collar of microvilli .",
    "the beating of the flagellum creates a current in the surrounding fluid that guides suspended prey such as bacteria through the collar @xcite where they can be caught and ultimately phagocytosed .",
    "the flagellar current also has the effect of causing the choanoflagellate cell to swim .",
    "m. cell body diameters are @xmath0 m .",
    "[ fig : colony ] ]    the choanoflagellate _",
    "salpingoeca rosetta _ can form colonies through incomplete cytokinesis @xcite . in the presence of certain bacteria",
    "@xcite , these colonies have an eponymous rosette - like shape as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colony ] .",
    "the colony morphology is variable , and the constituent flagella beat independently of one another @xcite .",
    "the random and independent flagellar motion argues against there being any coordination between cells in a colony , and as yet no evidence of any form of taxis for choanoflagellate colonies has been reported .    the geometry , cellular independence and lack of taxis observed in _ s. rosetta _",
    "colonies contrast with other lineages , such as the volvocales , a group of green algae @xcite .",
    "phototaxis is clearly observable in both unicellular ( _ chlamydomonas _ ) @xcite and colonial ( _ volvox _ )",
    "@xcite species , in order to maintain optimum light levels for photosynthesis .",
    "volvocalean phototaxis is _ deterministic _ , requiring precise tuning between the internal biochemical timescales and the rotation period of the organism as a whole .",
    "although _ s. rosetta _ colonies also rotate around an internal axis , due to the variable colony morphology and the independent beating of the individual flagella , this rotation rate will itself be random @xcite , rendering a strategy similar to that of the volvocales unlikely in",
    "_ s. rosetta_.    an alternative strategy is _ stochastic _ taxis , sometimes referred to kinesis .",
    "the classic example of stochastic taxis is the run - and - tumble chemotaxis of certain peritrichous bacteria @xcite . by spinning their left - handed helical flagella in different directions ,",
    "such bacteria can alternate between swimming in straight lines ( running ) and randomly reorienting themselves ( tumbling ) . through biasing tumbles to be less frequent when going up the gradient , the bacteria exhibit biased motion towards a chemoattractant without directly steering towards it @xcite .    here , we study _",
    "s. rosetta _ and show that it exhibits aerotaxis , _",
    "i.e. _ navigation along gradients of oxygen .",
    "we further examine and statistically analyze aerotaxis of _ s. rosetta _ colonies under spatio - temporal variations of oxygen at the level of total colony populations and at the level of the trajectories of individual colonies , and relate the two through mathematical analysis of a generalized keller - segel model @xcite and their demonstrate the internal consistency . from this analysis",
    "we establish two key features of the aerotactic response of choanoflagellates : they employ a stochastic taxis search strategy and the sensing of oxygen concentration gradients is logarithmic .",
    "the study of aerotaxis in bacteria has led to numerous methods for creating spatial oxygen gradients @xcite , one of which is the exploitation of soft lithography techniques @xcite . since pdms , the most commonly used material for microfluidic chambers , is permeable to gases , gas channels can be introduced in the devices to allow gaseous species to diffuse into the fluid .",
    "for example , an oxygen gradient can be created using a source channel flowing with normal air and a sink channel flowing with pure nitrogen .    our device , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : device ] , is a modified version of that used by adler , _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . viewed from above , the sample channel ( yellow ) consists of a wide observation chamber with thin inlet and outlet channels .",
    "the outlet leads to a serpentine channel that hinders bulk fluid flows . on each side of the sample channel",
    "are gas channels , the inlets of which are connected to a valve system allowing for the flow of air ( 20% oxygen ) and nitrogen .",
    "the flow of air and nitrogen can be conducted in any combination and configuration , _ e.g. _ oxygen in one channel and nitrogen in the other , and can be easily swapped over .",
    "the pdms chamber is plasma etched to a glass slide , and an extra glass slide is etched on top of the device , preventing air from diffusing in from the surrounding environment .",
    "m. [ fig : device ] ]        experiments were carried out immediately after plasma etching as the permeability of gases slowly decreases thereafter .",
    "cultures of _ s. rosetta _ were introduced at the inlet of the device , and both the inlet and outlet were then closed to prevent evaporative flows .",
    "a gradient of oxygen was set up by having air flowing in one of the side channels and nitrogen in the other .    ] .",

    "(  video_1_swap.avi  and  video_2_stay.avi)_.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]      our main experimental result , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : densityks]a , b , is the observation that _ s. rosetta _ colonies accumulate at the oxygen - rich side and away from the oxygen - poor side , _",
    "i.e. _ that they are aerotactic .",
    "this result has two main implications for choanoflagellates : first , they must have an oxygen - sensing mechanism .",
    "given their evolutionary proximity to animals in the tree of life , an interesting question is naturally the similarity to the oxygen - sensing mechanism of animals .",
    "secondly , choanoflagellates must have a mechanism to bias their swimming in order to swim towards oxygen - rich neighborhoods .",
    "we also found aerotaxis in the unicellular fast swimmer form @xcite of _ s. rosetta _ ( see si ) , showing that this is not an exclusive phenomenon to colonies .    with the present microfluidic device we can explore more details of choanoflagellate aerotaxis by dynamically changing the oxygen boundary conditions , for instance by flipping the gradient direction or by removing all oxygen influx after a uniform distribution has been reached .",
    "[ fig : densityks]c shows the result of such a dynamic experiment over the course of @xmath1 3.5 hours .",
    "the density is normalized for each frame resulting in some noise due to missing colonies in the tracking .",
    "many repetitions of the experiment show that the behavior in fig .",

    "fig : densityks ] supplement ) . for consistency",
    "the figures in the main text are based on this specific protocol .",
    "whenever one gas channel contains oxygen and the other nitrogen , the colonies swim towards the oxygen - rich side as further shown in video 1 of fig .",
    "[ fig : migrationvideos ] . in the time after a gas channel swap",
    ", the slope of the maximum density reveals the ensemble drift velocity @xmath2 . when there is oxygen in both gas channels , we observe that the density reaches an approximately uniform distribution within the time frame of the experiment .",
    "for periods in which nitrogen flows in both channels , this is not the case . under these experimental conditions ,",
    "the colonies accumulate in the middle of the chamber , where there is still some residual oxygen , as further shown in video 2 of fig .",
    "[ fig : migrationvideos ] .",
    "the fact that in this nitrogen - only configuration the colonies accumulate mid - chamber shows that accumulation does not depend on the presence of a nearby surface .",
    "with only nitrogen flowing , eventually there will be no oxygen gradient .",
    "nonetheless , we observed the colonies to stay in the middle of chamber even after 90 minutes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : densityks ] supplement ) . at that time ,",
    "the highest oxygen levels are estimated by the diffusion equation to be less than @xmath3 .",
    "this contrasting behavior between the oxygen - only and nitrogen - only configurations suggests an asymmetry in the aerotactic response , the nature of which can be made precise by studying the population dynamics .",

    "these results provide the input concentration field @xmath21 for the keller - segel model .        the simplest and widely - used response functional in the keller - segel model is linear in spatial gradients , @xmath22({{\\boldsymbol x}},t ) = \\beta\\bm{\\nabla } c({{\\boldsymbol x } } , t)$ ] , where @xmath23 is termed the _ taxis coefficient_. such a response can , however , reach unrealistic drift velocities , _",

    "most of the behavior of fig .",
    "[ fig : densityks]c can be explained by this model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : densityks ] supplement ) , but not the section where nitrogen is flowing in both side channels .",
    "the reason is the aforementioned asymmetry between the sensing - signalling in low versus high oxygen concentrations .",
    "many biological sensors exhibit logarithmic sensitivity to gradients .",
    "this is the case for the human senses such as hearing and sight , described by the weber - fechner law @xcite , and it is also found in certain bacteria @xcite .",

    "since the logarithmic sensing can not be maintained at infinitely small concentrations , there must naturally be some lower cutoff to this expression in absolute concentration levels .",
    "nonetheless , from a modelling perspective we can ignore this for the present experiments with nitrogen - only sections lasting less than 1.5 hours as discussed .",

    "( green curve ) at all times except in the nitrogen - only section , where the log - response function does not decay towards zero .",
    "a positive value of the response function means a positive ( @xmath26 ) drift velocity .",
    "the keller - segel equation with log - sensing is able to explain all sections of the experiment , as demonstrated in figure [ fig : densityks]d . the parameters obtained from a numerical fit include the drift velocity @xmath30 m/s ( which should be compared to the ensemble average speed @xmath31 ) and the diffusion constant @xmath32/s . using the ensemble - averaged speed , the diffusion constant can be related to an effective rotational diffusion constant @xmath33 .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 represents the coupling between the oxygen - gradient response and the resulting population drift , but it is a purely phenomenological quantity in which the underlying microscopic mechanism of aerotaxis is hidden .",
    "strategies of taxis can be categorized into two main classes : _ deterministic _ and _ stochastic_. in both strategies the swimming organism measures the attractant gradient ( for small organisms by some temporal filter @xcite ) .",
    "a deterministic strategy , then , is one in which the organism directly steers towards the attractant , such as seen in sperm cells that modulate their flagellar beat to adjust directly the curvature and torsion of its swimming path in the gradient direction @xcite . contrasting is a stochastic strategy such as bacterial run - and - tumble locomotion @xcite , where modulation of the frequency of random reorientations biases the motion in the gradient direction without directly steering towards it .",
