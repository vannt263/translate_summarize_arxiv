    "recently a new class of theories modifying general relativity ( gr ) has started to attract great attention mainly in order to explain observation data indicating the accelerated expansion of the late universe @xcite .",
    "it is based on the rather old theory attributed to einstein himself @xcite , however , forgotten for decades since it is in fact not a separate theory from the viewpoint of equation of motion , but rather a reformulation of gr . instead of torsion - free levi - civita connections it uses curvature free weitzenbck connections @xcite .",
    "it is well known that zero - curvature connections allow for the existence of a path - independent definition of vector parallel transport , so this theory has got the name of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) @xcite .",
    "what , however , has become clear rather recently is that the well - known modifications of gr , such as a theory of a scalar field nonminimally coupled to gravity , when constructed on the base of tegr , lead to different equations of motion ( for the reason of this see @xcite ) .",
    "such a theory has been intensively investigated in many papers during several recent years .",
    "generalizations of tegr are usually constructed in the same way as modifications of gr .",
    "it is possible to generalize the lagrangian replacing in it the torsion scalar @xmath0 with a function @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "different types of cosmological scenarios appear in scalar - torsion gravity , namely , in the class of models with nonminimal coupling between the torsion scalar and the scalar field @xmath2 of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a coupling constant , @xmath5 is some function of a scalar field @xcite .",
    "recently some other modifications of tegr including a nonminimal derivative coupling to torsion @xcite and analogs of the gauss - bonnet invariant have appeared @xcite .",
    "there are also modifications of tegr with no direct analogs of gr modification @xcite .    in our recent paper",
    "@xcite we applied dynamical system methods to scaler - torsion theory in order to find some cosmological asymptotic regimes and describe the corresponding phase portraits , focusing mainly on growing scalar field potentials .",
    "the main qualitative result of that paper is that scalar - torsion coupling leads to much less variety of possible dynamical regimes than scalar - curvature coupling @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we give an heuristic explanation of this feature , as well as show that more possibilities appears for decreasing scalar fields potentials , usually used in quintessence models .",
    "as such models have been created for a description of the late universe , when the usual matter is important as well , we add hydrodynamical matter to the scalar field . we will use units with @xmath6 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we present equation of motion in initial and expansion normalized variables , in sect .",
    "3 the analysis of stationary points and corresponding asymptotic solutions is given , and sect .",
    "4 gives a brief summary of results obtained .",
    "we start with describing basic objects of teleparallel gravity . in this theory",
    "the dynamical variables are the tetrad fields ( also called the vierbein fields ) @xmath7 ; here greek indices relate to space - time and capital latin indices belong to the tangent space - time .",
    "the metric tensor is expressed in terms of the tetrad as @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "for the definition of parallel transport of a vector the weitzenbck connection @xcite is used , @xmath10 then the torsion tensor and the torsion scalar are given by @xmath11 @xmath12 on the other hand , the curvature of the weitzenbck connection vanishes identically .",
    "we consider the cosmological model with the following action : @xmath13+\\mathcal{s}_m , \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the determinant of the tetrad ,  @xmath15 ,  @xmath2 is a canonical scalar field ,  @xmath16 its potential , and @xmath17 its arbitrary nonminimal coupling with the torsion scalar @xmath0 ,  @xmath18 is the matter action . in the classical scalar - curvature theory",
    "the action has the same form except for the curvature scalar @xmath19 replacing torsion scalar @xmath0 .    for the spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker tetrad @xmath20 +",
    "( the corresponding metric is @xmath21 ) the system of field equations is @xcite @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the scale factor , @xmath26 is the hubble parameter , the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "we have used that in the chosen tetrad @xmath27 .",
    "the matter equation of state is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 $ ] .      in the standard scalar - curvature theory of a nonminimal coupling the conformal transformation to einstein frame",
    "is often used . in the einstein frame",
    "the theory is equivalent to gr with a scalar field as a source , so the evolution of the scalar field in an expanding universe is , as usual , directed to the minimum of the potential , which is not true in the initial nonminimal formulation , called the jordan frame .",
    "this conformal transformation is usually divided into two steps : a redifinition of the potential via @xmath30 , where @xmath31 in our notations , and a redifinition of the scalar field in order to get the canonical kinetic term .",
    "the combination denoted here as @xmath32 is rather interesting by itself .",
    "it is a conformal invariant , so it is not changed by any conformal transformation @xcite .",
    "moreover , it can give important information as regards the dynamics of the system without the second step to the einstein frame ( which is usually much more technically complicated than very easily calculated first step ) .",
    "namely , de sitter solutions corresponds to minima of the effective potential , their stability is determined by sign of the second derivative of the effective potential in a standard way @xcite .    in the scalar - torsion theory",
    "the einstein frame does not exist @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible to introduce some analog of effective potential with the same properties as in the scalar - curvature theory .",
    "indeed , taking into account ( [ system1 ] ) we rewrite ( [ system3 ] ) for @xmath33 @xmath34 we see that the effective potential , of the form @xmath35 has a derivative with respect to @xmath2 @xmath36 which coincides with numerator of the last term in ( [ ddotphi ] ) .",
    "the de sitter solution @xmath37 , @xmath38 , in this model exists for @xmath39 from this system it is follows that @xmath40 now we add small perturbations to the de sitter solution : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , + @xmath43 . substituting these perturbations to ( [ ddotphi ] ) we get in the first order @xmath44 new variables @xmath45",
    ", @xmath46 are introduced and the first - order system of differential equations is written in the form @xmath47 we find eigenvalues for the system ( [ systems1s2 ] ) @xmath48 so , the de sitter solution is stable in the minima of the effective potential , as expected .",
    "it is worth to note that the second equation in eq .",
    "( [ conditionds ] ) is just the `` balanced solution '' studied in @xcite , so from computational point of view the effective potential gives nothing new .",
    "however , from heuristic point of view often it is much easier to visualize the locations of the minima of some function instead of doing calculations .",
    "for example , for positive power - law potential and coupling functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 de sitter solution exists only for negative @xmath51 with @xmath52 . this fact has been established computationally in @xcite and becomes now a trivial consequence of the form of @xmath53 .",
    "we introduce new dimensionless variables @xmath54 and also dimensionless parameters @xmath55 choosing the power - law function @xmath56 and the potential @xmath57 we get @xmath58 , @xmath59 .    note the useful relation between @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , namely , @xmath63 it is useful to introduce auxiliary variables @xmath64 which are expressed through dimensionless variables and parameters from the system ( [ system1])-([system3 ] ) , @xmath65 from ( eq . [ system1 ] ) using ( [ variables ] ) we get @xmath66 then @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath73 , then instead of ( [ xman ] ) , and ( [ xyn ] ) we have @xmath74 @xmath75 and the first - order system of differential equations @xmath76 we consider only the case of @xmath77 in the present paper .",

    "first of all , all regimes found above ( except the de sitter solution , which is an exact , and not only an asymptotic solution ) exist in the @xmath164 limit where we can neglect the einstein term in comparison with the term originating from a nonminimal coupling in the denominator of the expansion in normalized variables we use . when the field is small ( which is realized near a cosmological singularity for decreasing power - law potentials ) the universe expands according to gr , since the correction terms are less important .",
    "such regimes for quintessence potentials are well known and are not included in our analysis here . as for the large @xmath2 regimes , studied in the present paper , we require that the omitted terms in the equations of motion be negligible for large @xmath2 .",
    "otherwise the regime can not be realized as an asymptotic solution .",
    "for example , suppose we have a vacuum asymptotic solution .",
    "if the influence of matter grows with growing @xmath2 , this means that the asymptotic solution corresponding to this particular expansion dynamics is absent if we add any amount of matter .",
    "this does not mean that such a regime has no physical meaning at all  the universe may follow it as transient one , if the amount of matter is small enough .",
    "however , such a situation does not belong to the asymptotic regimes , and we will not list it in the following .",
    "the analysis described above ( with stability results got from the corresponding eigenvalues ) leads to the following results for vacuum solutions summarized in table 1 ( points @xmath165 and @xmath166 , being non - vacuum , are not included ) .",
    "we can see from this table that in the vacuum case there are three possible future stable regimes :    * for @xmath167 a de sitter solution exists and is stable . * for @xmath168 and @xmath169 the regime of point @xmath170 is stable . * for @xmath168 and @xmath171 the kinetic dominating regime of point @xmath123 is stable .",
    "when the matter is taken into account , the situation is described in the table 2 ( note that the de sitter solution in the presence of matter is an asymptotic solution ) .",

    "for @xmath176 the square root equals zero in the eigenvalues @xmath177 of point 6 ( see [ lambda6 ] ) .",
    "we see that point @xmath123 ( a kinetic dominating regime ) is absent  this situation is described in the beginning of this section as an illustration of what we call the existing asymptotic regimes . in this particular case matter with @xmath178 would inevitably destroy a vacuum regime of the point @xmath123 in late time .",

    "in the present paper we considered the evolution of the universe in a teleparallel version of a nonminimally coupled scalar field theory , focusing mostly on quintessence scalar field potentials . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite we already pointed out the radical differences in the dynamics of a `` classical '' and teleparallel cases of this theory .",
    "here we provided a qualitative explanation of this difference using the notion of an effective scalar field potential .",
    "it appears as a first step from a jordan to an einstein frame ( to be followed by redefinition of the scalar field in order to transform the kinetic term to the canonical form ) in the standard theory , though it already gives an intuitively clear picture of possible dynamical regimes without this second step .",
    "it is interesting that in the teleparallel version , where the einstein frame does not exist at all @xcite , the effective potential nevertheless can be introduced in the same manner .",
    "the difference in the forms of this effective potential ( being @xmath182 for the classical case and @xmath183 for the teleparallel case , where @xmath16 is the scalar field potential and @xmath184 is the coupling function which includes the einstein - hilbert term ) results in very different dynamics for the same scalar field potentials .    for the standard scalar - curvature coupling",
    ", the presence of @xmath184 [ which is usually taken in the form @xmath185 in the denominator leads to run - away solution for growing @xmath16 , corresponding to @xmath32 decreasing for large @xmath2 .",
    "this may happen if @xmath186 grows more rapidly than @xmath187 with @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in the boundary case of @xmath188 for large @xmath2 the effective potential is asymptotically flat , which is the reason for the existence of viable higgs inflation models @xcite .",
    "none of these features can exist for the effective potential in the form of @xmath189 as in scalar - torsion theory .",
    "for the usual quadratic coupling ( we study only this form of the coupling in the present paper ) @xmath32 is growing for an arbitrarly growing @xmath16 , so the dynamics inevitably pushes the scalar field toward zero , as we have seen in our previous paper . on the contrary , for the decreasing potentials studied in the present paper the effective potential can have a minimum , resulting in de sitter solution . for a quadratic coupling this happens if @xmath16 scales less steep than @xmath98 .",
    "this condition for a de sitter solution to exist has been obtained earlier in @xcite and in a more general context in @xcite , and we now have a very easy way to explain it .",
    "steeper potentials result in unlimited growing of the scalar field , similar to the quintessence scenario in gr .",
    "we have identified a tracker solution which is always an attractor in its range of existence .",
    "it is shown that when the coupling constant @xmath4 is low enough for the tracker to exist ( see the corresponding condition in table 2 ) , a vacuum regime is stable , so the scalar field dominates at late time .",
    "we also list several unstable asymptotic regimes .",
    "a full description of the scalar field dynamics requires matching solutions studied in the present paper with gr solutions valid for small @xmath2 .",
    "we leave this for future work .",
