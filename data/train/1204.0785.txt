    "did not get stuck in a local minimum , we ran the sed - fitter in two ways : first with all three parameters ( m@xmath27 , t@xmath27 , @xmath1 ) free to vary ; second by fixing the value of @xmath1 while allowing m@xmath27 and t@xmath27 to vary and repeating the process for all values of @xmath1 in the range 0.20 to 5.90 in 0.01 intervals , selecting the result with the lowest @xmath28 .",
    "both methods gave consistent results but we created the final maps of the dust properties by choosing the result with the lowest @xmath28 for each pixel .",
    "the spire calibration has an overall systematic uncertainty of 5% due to the uncertainty in the prime calibrator neptune , and a statistical uncertainty of 2% determined from instrumental reproducibility ; the spire observer s manual recommends linearly adding these to give an overall uncertainty of 7% . to implement this in practice in our fitting algorithm",
    "we increased the uncorrelated uncertainty to give the same overall uncertainty when the errors are added in quadrature .",
    "this is implemented in the sed fitting by using the full covariance matrix in the @xmath28 calculation .",

    "this method takes full account of all the wavelength - dependant effects associated with pacs and spire . in previous work @xcite we found that there is a significant contribution from a warmer component of dust at wavelengths @xmath470and so the _ spitzer _  flux at 70  is treated as an upper limit in the fitting ( i.e , if the flux value is higher than the model it does not contribute to @xmath28 ) .",

    "@xcite suggest that a warmer component could influence the dust emission up to wavelengths of 160 ; to test this we repeated the sed - fitting by treating the _ spitzer _  and pacs fluxes as upper limits and found it made a negligible difference to our results .    to estimate the uncertainties on the results of our fits we use a monte - carlo technique .",
    "for each pixel we create a set of 1000 artificial seds , created by taking the original flux densities and adding a random value selected from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation equal to the uncertainty in the measured flux ( the correlations between the calibration uncertainties for spire are also included ) .",
    "we estimate the error in the derived parameters for each pixel from the 1000 fits .",

    "while this potentially causes us to miss the very coldest dust due to weak emission in the shortest wavelength bands , we choose it as a conservative approach to ensure we have accurate estimates of temperature . in practice",

    "noise was then added to the simulated fluxes with a value equal to the errors in the real fluxes ( excluding the calibration errors ) for 2000 repetitions per t , @xmath1 combination .",

    "whether the transition in the dust parameters is due to the changing contribution to the isrf from the general stellar population and star formation or if there is another influence in the bulge is unknown .",

    "the drop in @xmath1 towards the center of the galaxy may be caused by increased sputtering or sublimation of mantles from an increased isrf .",
    "the origin of the high @xmath1 values at 3.1kpc from the center is less clear but may be indicative of either grain coagulation or an increase in the growth of icy mantles .",

    "we find no evidence for ` dark gas ' , using a similar technique as the _ planck _ team .",

    "we have used an alternative technique by constructing a gas - to - dust map after correcting for the radial gradient .",
    "we do find regions with enhancements ( i.e. , higher values of @xmath124 ) , which may show places where ` dark gas ' exists , or may be due to local variations in the gas - to - dust ratio .",
