    "nonlocality is a fundamental property of quantum states , and it has been the subject of intensive studies in the past decades  @xcite .",
    "a related topic of interest which has been recently discussed is the measurement - induced nonlocality  @xcite , originating from the superdense coding  @xcite .",
    "one of the key steps of the superdense coding is to apply a pauli matrix operation to half of a bell state , giving rise to another orthogonal bell state , while the reduced density matrices are invariant under this transformation .",
    "in such a case , the states of both two subsystems are not changed after the local unitary operation , but the state of the whole system is changed .",
    "this is a nonlocal effect , which was originally quantified by the hilbert - schmidt norm  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the local unitary invariant was generalized to the locally invariant measurements , and the measurement - induced nonlocality was defined via the hilbert - schmidt norm  @xcite , which is the so - called geometric nonlocality .",
    "they derived an analytical formula for any dimensional pure state and @xmath0 dimensional mixed states .",
    "recently , in  @xcite , the problem of evaluating measurement - induced nonlocality for general bipartite mixed states was discussed .",
    "the measurement - induced nonlocality provides a novel classification scheme for the bipartite states , and may be useful in the quantitative study of quantum state steering  @xcite . in this paper , we introduce an entropic measure of nonlocality for quantum states which is applicable for multipartite systems , and give an physical interpretation .",
    "this provides a consistent way to compare different correlations , such as entanglement , discord , classical correlations , and quantum dissonance  @xcite .    to quantify the nonlocal effect , we consider the relative entropy between the pre- and post - measurement states , and introduce the so - called relative entropy of nonlocality",
    "we then derive some basic properties of the relative entropy of nonlocality .",
    "this quantification leads to an operational interpretation for the nonlocality , which can be stated by maximal entropy increase in terms of the locally invariant measurement .",
    "we find that the relative entropy of nonlocality is upper bounded by the von - neumann entropy of the measured subsystem for arbitrary quantum states . as an application , we derive a closed formula for the maximal distance achievable for bell - diagonal states . in such a case , we find that the upper bound of relative entropy of nonlocality is saturated for some mixed bell - diagonal states .",
    "we choose entropic measures for the nonlocality , which is different from the geometric nonlocality based on the hilbert - schmidt norm  @xcite .",
    "we can prove that the relative entropy of nonlocality is always greater than or equal to the squared geometric nonlocality .",
    "several trade - off relations can be given by the quantum side information and the missing information .",
    "we also show that the relative entropy of nonlocality is equal to the maximal distillable entanglement between the measurement apparatus and the system if the von neumann measurement is performed on one part of the system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ren ] , we define the relative entropy of nonlocality and present its relevant properties . we illustrate the relative entropy of nonlocality by the bell - diagonal states . in sec .",

    "note that the relative entropy of nonlocality is different from the relative entropy of quantumness  @xcite and the one - way quantum deficit  @xcite .",
    "the relationships between the relative entropy of nonlocality and the one - way quantum deficit are the same as the relationships between the geometric nonlocality  @xcite and the geometric measure of quantum discord  @xcite . along with this way",
    ", the relative entropy of nonlocality is a meaningful and reasonable quantification , and it can be viewed as an indicator of the global effect caused by locally invariant measurements  @xcite .",

    "\\(iv ) @xmath28 for any entangled state @xmath7 .",
    "following the properties of relative entropy  @xcite , ( i ) and ( ii ) are easy to obtain . since the von neumann measurement @xmath10 does not disturb @xmath6 , @xmath11 , after some manipulation one obtains that each @xmath29=0 $ ] .",
    "this implies that the measurement @xmath10 are eigenprojectors of @xmath6 .",
    "another proof of this fact was recently given by luo  @xcite .",

    "this implies that @xmath33 is the only von neumann measurement that does not disturb @xmath6 .",

    "in general , a von neumann measurement induces entropy increase , and this change is described by the relative entropy .",

    "this result gives a meaningful physical interpretation of the measurement - induced nonlocality .",
    "more importantly , it allows us to derive a upper bound for the relative entropy of nonlocality .",

    "( [ eq : ren_3 ] ) . for bipartite pure state @xmath51 ,",
    "every post - measurement state of the subsystem @xmath16 is a pure state for any von neumann measurement on subsystem @xmath52 , which implies that @xmath53 .",
    "this shows that the relative entropy of nonlocality reduces to the entropy of the measured system entropy for pure states , which coincides with the relative entropy of quantumness and entanglement , but this is not true for general mixed states .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ren_3 ] ) , the relative entropy of nonlocality  ( [ eq : difference of entropy ] ) is also equal to the maximal value of difference of two conditional entropies  @xcite @xmath54,\\label{eq : difference of conditional entropy}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the von neumann conditional entropy and @xmath56 is quantum conditional entropy  @xcite .",
    "it is known that quantum discord  @xcite is equal to the minimal difference of two conditional entropies for any von neumann measurement  @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : difference of entropy ] ) is achieved .",
    "now , the main difficulty in calculating the relative entropy of nonlocality is to find an optimal locally invariant measurement for the degenerated measured subsystem .",
    "if the measured subsystem is degenerate , then a number of eigenstates share a common eigenvalue .",
    "these eigenstates can span the eigenspace of this eigenvalue .",
    "the linear combination of these eigenstates are still eigenstates in this eigenspace .",
    "then , we conclude that the maximal process is only obtained by taking maximal values in every degenerated eigenspace of the measured subsystem .    to give an intuitive understanding of the relative entropy of nonlocality , let us illustrate it by a fundamental example .",
    "we consider the bell - diagonal states , whose reduced states are degenerate , namely , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the identity operator on the subsystem @xmath59 , @xmath60 are real numbers and @xmath61 are pauli operators . to obtain the relative entropy of nonlocality , combined with eq .",
    "( [ eq : difference of conditional entropy ] ) , we only evaluate the maximal quantum conditional entropy under the locally invariant measurements on @xmath52 . following the approach in  @xcite , we have @xmath62 where the maximum is taken over all the von neumann measurements on @xmath52 ( since @xmath63 is degenerate , any von neumann measurement will leave @xmath31 invariant ) . here , the function @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "then , the relative entropy of nonlocality can be given as @xmath66 where @xmath67    in particular , taking @xmath68 , one has @xmath69 .",
    "in such a case , we have @xmath70 from this example , we find that the relative entropy of nonlocality is equal to the von neumann entropy of the measured subsystem for some two - qubit mixed states .",
    "we will compare @xmath71 and @xmath21 , the latter will be shown to majorize the former .",
    "the main result of this section is shown in the following .",
    "for any bipartite state @xmath72 , the relative entropy of nonlocality is always greater than or equal to the square of the geometric nonlocality , @xmath73    if there exists an optimal locally invariant measurement @xmath74 such that @xmath75 , then the closest @xmath76 achieves the maximum of the hilbert - schmidt norm @xmath77 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath78 we know from  @xcite that for any two quantum states @xmath72 and @xmath79 , the following inequality holds , @xmath80 thanks to eq.([eq : revshs ] ) , this yields @xmath81 from the definition of the relative entropy of nonlocality , we have @xmath82 combined eqs .",
