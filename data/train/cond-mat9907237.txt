    "nav@xmath0o@xmath1 has been reported to be the second inorganic spin - peierls compound @xcite , following cugeo@xmath9 , with a phase transition temperature t@xmath8=34 k. however , recent experimental findings suggest a different character for the phase transition of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 as compared to that of cugeo@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "nav@xmath0o@xmath1 is believed to be a nearly perfect realization of a quarter - filled low - dimensional system , with possible charge ordering below the critical temperature .",
    "such a scenario is supported by structural analysis @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance experiments @xcite and raman scattering studies @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that the v ions are equivalent at room temperature and in a mixed - valent state , v@xmath10 .",
    "when lowering the temperature below @xmath11 the v sites change their valence from uniform to alternating v@xmath12 and v@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "two different models for the electronic ordering in the low - temperature phase have been discussed .",
    "one is described as in - line @xcite with the v@xmath12 ions arranged along the legs of the ladder ( * b*-axis ) and the other one with the v@xmath12 ions arranged in a zig - zag manner along the * b*-axis @xcite .",
    "the first one requires an additional phase transition , like the ordinary spin - peierls transition , for an opening of the spin - gap . for the second one",
    "it is argued that a spin - gap appears due to the zig - zag ordering itself @xcite .",
    "however , in both cases the driving mechanism for a particular charge ordering has not been elucidated . in the raman spectra",
    "this transition manifests itself through the appearance of new modes whose origin is still not fully understood @xcite . in general ,",
    "raman scattering intensities are strongly correlated with the electronic structure of solids .",
    "their determination as a function of the laser photon energy yields information about the energies of interband transitions and their orbital character as has been highlighted recently by resonance raman measurements on high- temperature superconductors @xcite . having this in mind ,",
    "we have measured raman intensities as a function of the laser wavelength , both above and below the phase transition temperature . on the basis of the observed effects we discuss the origin of the resonances and the electronic structure of nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the measurements were performed on single crystals , with a size of approximately 1x3x1 mm@xmath14 along the * a * , * b * , and * c * axis , respectively , prepared as described in @xcite . as exciting source we used eight lines from ar@xmath15 and kr@xmath15 ion lasers , with photon energies between 1.55 to 2.71 ev .",
    "the laser beam , with an average power of 5 mw , was focused on the ( 001 ) surface of the crystals .",
    "the spectra were measured in back - scattering geometry using a dilor xy triple monochromator equipped with a ccd camera .",
    "comparable relative raman intensities were obtained by normalizing the measured spectra with respect to the calibrated spectral emission density of an ulbricht sphere system ( opto - electronik reiche gmbh ) , thus taking care of the varying spectral response of both spectrometer and detector over the large wavelength range investigated .",
    "the room temperature raman spectra in @xmath16 and @xmath17 polarized configurations are presented in fig . [ fig1]a ) and b ) . in the ( aa ) spectra seven phonon modes",
    "are clearly seen with an additional broad continuum peaked at 650 @xmath2 . in this geometry all modes , as well as the continum , decrease in intensity with decreasing laser photon energy . in the spectra measured with energies lower than 2 ev the appearance of an additional continuum centered at about 170 @xmath2 is observed .",
    "in contrast to the ( aa ) spectra , most peaks in the ( bb ) spectra do not vary much with the laser line used , except for the 534 @xmath2 mode . according to a lattice dynamical calculation @xcite , the 969 @xmath2 mode originates from apical oxygen vibrations ( v-@xmath6 stretching vibrations ) along the * c*-axis .",
    "the increase of its ( aa ) intensity with increasing laser energy can be related to the resonance of the incoming ( or scattered ) laser light with the strong electronic absorption band at 3.22 ev , observed by ellipsometry @xcite . according to lmto calculations",
    "@xcite this band represents the excitation of electrons hopping from the @xmath3(@xmath4 ) to the v(@xmath5 ) orbital .",
    "since the dielectric function along the c - axis has no structure in the 1.7 to 5.5 ev range , we conclude that plane bonds strongly couple with the apical oxygen leading to a large stokes - raman efficiency , @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , an electronic band related to @xmath3(@xmath19)-v(@xmath5 ) hopping is found along the * b*-axis at 3.73 ev @xcite .",
    "we thus expect a large intensity for the ( bb ) 969 @xmath2 phonon at a laser energy around 3.7 ev .",
    "one can use similar arguments for the resonant behavior of other phonons with displacements that influence the o - v hopping .",
    "the ( aa ) modes with energies of 448 and 534 @xmath2 overlap with the broad continuum centered at 650 @xmath2 and exhibit typical fano - type lineshapes @xcite .",
    "we analyse the lineshape of the 535 @xmath2 mode by fitting to the standard fano expresion @xcite .",
    "the fitting parametar @xmath20 is plotted vs. excitation energy in the inset of fig.[fig1 ] . from the linear extrapolation we obtain a resonance energy of @xmath21=0.9 0.2 ev .",
    "this energy can be associated with a large absorption band centered around 1 - 1.2 ev @xcite , observed in both the * e*@xmath22*a * and the * e*@xmath22*b * optical absorption spectra .",
    "this band has been tentatively assigned to d - d transitions @xcite . in the literature",
    "there is still no consensus as to whether the 1 ev band can be assigned to a d - d transition energy within the t - j model using a reasonable range of parameters , with @xcite or without @xcite charge disproportionation .",
    "an even more controversial issue concerns the existence of low energy excitations in these models , as a possible explanation for broad features found in ir and raman spectra @xcite .",
    "the low - temperature ( t=10 k ) ( aa ) and ( bb ) raman spectra are given in fig . [ fig2]a ) and b ) .",
    "we find new modes that become active below the phase transition temperature , t@xmath8=34 k , due to the doubling of the unit cell .",
    "this doubling can be explained by assuming the charge - ordering scenario with a zig - zag ordering pattern of the charges @xcite .",
    "almost all new modes show resonant behavior . the lowest frequency modes with energies at 66 and 106 @xmath2 , previously assigned to magnetic excitations @xcite , exhibit an increase in intensity by approximately an order of magnitude when using a laser photon energy around 1.85 ev ( with respect to that at 2.43 ev ) in ( aa ) polarized spectra .",
    "the intensity of the the 66 @xmath2 mode is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) ( aa - polarization ) and fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) ( bb - polarization ) as a function of the laser energy . in the same figures we show @xmath23 and @xmath24 for comparison , taken from @xcite , respectively .",
    "the peak at 1.85 ev of the 66 @xmath2 mode intensity in ( aa ) polarization occurs close to the broad structure centered around 2 ev .",
    "the electronic transitions around 2 ev consist of two bands centered at 2 and 2.1 ev .",
    "their low absorption strength , energy position and band separation of about 0.1 ev are typical for crystal- field transitions of d - elements .",
    "thus , it is possible that these two absorption bands correspond to crystal - field - excitations of @xmath25 ions from the ground xy state to @xmath26 and to @xmath27 states .",
    "the intensity behavior of the 66 @xmath2 mode in ( bb ) polarization is quite different : intensity is increasing with increasing laser energy and has a local minimum around 2.2 ev .",
    "again , such behavior is not easy to understand from simple comparisom with @xmath28 and more correct analyses are necessary to clarify these effects .",
    "the difference in the resonance behavior of the 948 @xmath2 mode in the ( aa ) and the ( bb ) spectra , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig4]c ) , is also of interest .",
    "while in the case of the ( aa ) spectrum this mode looses intensity with decreasing laser energy , its behavior in the ( bb ) spectra is exactly the opposite .",
    "the origin of this effect is not clear .",
    "however , it has been argued by riera and poilblanc @xcite that a zig - zag pattern of charges in a ladder can be stabilized by the holstein coupling and the nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion .",
    "this indicates the importance of electron - phonon interaction as a possible driving mechanism for charge - ordering in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "if the 948 @xmath2 phonon is somehow involved in charge ordering ( via electron - phonon coupling ) it would see such a particular electronic structure @xcite in its resonanace behaviour .",
    "finally , we discuss the possible antiresonant behavior around 2.2 ev , suggested by comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) and d ) .",
    "such an effect usually results from an cancellation of resonant and nonresonant contributions to the scattering amplitude .",
    "correspondingly , the cross section becomes very small below ( or above ) the critical point energy .",
    "however , it is also possible that there are two resonances , one at 1.7 ev and one around 2.5 ev . thus phonons are resonant either only at 1.7 ev ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , [ fig4]c ) , only at 2.5 ev ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]c ) , or at both energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b , d ) . to resolve these possibilities more acurate measurements are required .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented measurements of raman intensities as a function of the laser wavelength above and below the phase transition temperature . we have found that various phonons show significant resonances around 1.8 and 2.5 ev . the first one can be probably associated with weak crystal - field absorption bands around 2 ev , while the second one may corresponds to the band which represents the excitations of electrons hopping from the @xmath29 to the @xmath30 orbitals .",
