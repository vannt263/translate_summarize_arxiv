    "over the last few decades powerlaw distributions have attracted particular attention for their mathematical properties and appearances in a wide variety of scientific contexts , from physical and biological sciences to social and man - made phenomena @xcite . differently from normally distributed data ,",
    "empirical quantities that follow a powerlaw distribution do not cluster around an average value , and thus can not be characterized through the mean and standard deviation .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that some scientific observations can not be characterized as simply as other measurements is often a sign of complex underlying processes that deserve further study @xcite . a complete introduction to powerlaw distributions along with a statistical framework for discerning and quantifying powerlaw behavior in empirical data can be found in @xcite , whereas extensive discussions can be found in @xcite , and references therein .",
    "recent advances related to powerlaw fitting and statistical hypothesis testing can be found in @xcite .",
    "formally , a quantity @xmath1 follows a powerlaw distribution if its probability distribution is defined as @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is called the _ scaling parameter _ of the distribution .",
    "fitting these kind of heavy - tailed distributions requires care , since only few empirical phenomena show such a probability distribution for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , more often only values greater than some minimum value @xmath5 , i.e. the so called _ lower bound _ , follow a powerlaw distribution .",
    "the traditional lower bound estimation method introduced in @xcite is based on the computation of the kolmogorov - smirnov distances between the empirical and the theoretical cumulative distribution functions defined for values @xmath6 when @xmath1 is discrete ( @xmath7 when @xmath1 is continuous ) .",
    "once the kolmogorov - smirnov distances have been computed for all the eligible values of @xmath5 , the @xmath5 associated with the smallest distance is chosen as lower bound of the distribution . however , if applied to very large collections of data  e.g. the distribution of the number of views received by youtube videos",
    " such a method can be computationally demanding , and bootstrap techniques to address the uncertainty in the estimates and average over multiple estimations become unfeasible .    in this paper ,",
    "we propose two alternative methods with the aim to reduce the time required by the traditional estimation procedure .",
    "in particular , the first proposed method starts to compute the traditional kolmogorov - smirnov distance from a guess on the true value of the lower bound , and stops the procedure once a minimum is reached .",
    "the second proposed method is thought for the discrete case , where the computation of theoretical cumulative distribution functions involves the calculation of hurwitz zeta functions , which could be computationally binding .",
    "such a method uses the above - mentioned conditions to reduce the number of computations , and substitutes the cumulative distribution functions of the traditional kolmogorov - smirnov distance with the corresponding probability mass functions , i.e. it is based on the comparison between empirical and theoretical probabilities for each @xmath6 .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we provide some basic definitions about continuous and discrete powerlaw distributions . in section 3",
    "we first discuss the traditional estimation method , and then we introduce two alternative methods which can speed up the estimation procedure . in section 4",
    "we apply the three methods to large collections of data ( @xmath0 ) with varying values of the true lower bound , showing that both our proposed methods yield a significantly better performance and accuracy than the traditional method .",
    "section 5 is left for some concluding remarks .",
    "let @xmath1 represents a quantity whose distribution we are interested in .",
    "the probability distribution when @xmath1 is continuous is defined as    @xmath8    whereas in the discrete case , when @xmath1 can assume only positive integers , the probability distribution is defined as    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the lower bound , @xmath4 is the scaling parameter , and @xmath11    is the hurwitz zeta function .",
    "furthermore , the complementary cumulative distribution function in the continuous case is defined as    @xmath12    whereas in the discrete case is defined as    @xmath13    the complementary cumulative distribution function is often preferred to the cumulative distribution function since it allows to show powerlaw distributions in doubly logarithmic axes , and thus emphasize their upper tail behavior .",
    "the traditional method to estimate the lower bound of a powerlaw distribution has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "such a method is based on the kolmogorov - smirnov distance , which is defined as @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the empirical cumulative distribution function , and @xmath16 is the theoretical cumulative distribution function of the fitted powerlaw distribution for values @xmath6 when @xmath1 is discrete ( @xmath7 when @xmath1 is continuous , and hereafter we refer only to the discrete case for the sake of brevity ) . once the kolmogorov - smirnov distance has been computed for all the possible values @xmath5 , the @xmath5 associated with the smallest value of @xmath17 is chosen as the lower bound of the powerlaw distribution .",
    "in @xcite it has been proved that the estimation method based on the kolmogorov - smirnov distance outperforms alternative methods based on the bic ( bayesian information criterion ) and the anderson - darling statistics . nevertheless",
    ", when dealing with big data such a method can be computationally demanding for two main reasons :    1 .",
    "the algorithm needs to compute the kolmogorov - smirnov distance for each possible @xmath5 ; 2 .   in the discrete case ,",
    "the computation of the theoretical cumulative distribution function of the fitted powerlaw distributions involves the calculation of hurwitz zeta functions , which can be computationally binding when dealing with large data collections .      in this paper",
    ", we aim at introducing two lower bound estimation methods in order to tackle the above - mentioned drawbacks of the traditional method .",
    "we start from two simple observations .",
    "first of all , often there is no need to compute the kolmogorov - smirnov distance for all the eligible values of @xmath5 , since a graphical exploratory analysis is usually sufficient to rule out a substantial range of values . on the left panel of figure [ fig : example ] ,",
    "we show the complementary cumulative distribution function of a random generated distribution with powerlaw tail .",
    "notice that a quick look at the plot is sufficient to rule out some eligible values for the lower bound . when dealing with big data and large maximal values , we could rule out hundreds of possible values , thus reducing the required time to estimate the lower bound .",
    "moreover , we know by definition that the kolmogorov - smirnov statistics computed for all the possible values @xmath5 has a global minimum in correspondence to the true lower bound . on the right panel of figure [ fig : example ] , we show the values of the kolmogorov - smirnov distance in correspondence to subsequent values of @xmath5 .    taking into account these observations ,",
    "we propose a first estimation method which starts computing the kolmogorov - smirnov distances from the eligible value of @xmath5 that is closest to @xmath18    where @xmath19 is a guess on the true value of the lower bound , and @xmath20 $ ] is the confidence in such a guess .",
    "the computation of the kolmogorov - smirnov distances stops when all the differences between the last @xmath21 distances are positive ",
    "i.e. when a minimum is reached .",
    "the key ideas are two :    1 .",
    "since a quick graphical exploratory analysis is often sufficient to rule out a large amount of eligible values , we can start computing the kolmogorov - smirnov distances from the value we think it is the true lower bound ; 2 .",
    "if our guess is close to the true lower bound , the first minimum of the kolmogorov - smirnov statistics we meet is the global minimum associated with the true lower bound , and hence we can stop the computation once a minimum is reached .    moreover , since in the discrete case the computation of the theoretical cumulative distributions involves the calculation of hurwitz zeta functions , we propose a second estimation method that further modify the traditional method by substituting the empirical and theoretical cumulative distribution functions of the kolmogorov - smirnov distance with the corresponding probability mass functions , which are generally faster to compute .",
    "more formally , in the second proposed method the distance to be computed is defined as @xmath22    where the subscripts indicate that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , respectively , the empirical probability mass functions , and the theoretical probability mass function of the fitted powerlaw distribution for values @xmath6 .",
    "in this section , we illustrate and discuss the results of a simulation comparing the two proposed methods with the traditional estimation method .",
    "we refer to the traditional method as ` estimate_xmin `  the name of the lower bound estimation function provided by the r package ` powerlaw ` @xcite  and to our proposed methods as    1 .",
    "` getxmin ` : the first proposed method still based on the classical traditional kolmogorov - smirnov distance ; 2 .   `",
    "getxmin2 ` : the second proposed method based on distances between empirical and theoretical probability mass functions .",
    "both ` getxmin ` and ` getxmin2 ` are implemented for discrete powerlaw distributions on the r package ` statools ` @xcite , which is currently available on cran .    in order to test the three different methods , we generate synthetic data and examine both the accuracy and the performance in the estimation of the true lower bound .",
    "we use data drawn from a distribution with the form @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is a normalization constant .",
    "we apply the three estimation methods to large ( @xmath0 ) collections of data drawn from eq .",
    "[ eq : distr ] with true values of @xmath5 varying in @xmath26 .    in our simulation",
    ", we set @xmath19 equal to the true lower bound with a @xmath27 confidence , @xmath28 ",
    "e.g. when the true lower bound is @xmath29 , our proposed methods start to compute the corresponding statistics from the possible value of @xmath5 that is closest to @xmath30 , which is a feasible practice , thus assisting the user in making a good guess on the true value of the lower bound . ] and thus a reasonable assumption . moreover , both ` getxmin ` and ` getxmin2 ` stop to compute the corresponding statistics once a first minimum is reached , i.e. when all the differences between the last @xmath31 computed distances are positive .",
    "figure [ fig : simulation ] shows the estimated value of @xmath5 as a function of the true lower bound , indicating that both ` getxmin ` and ` getxmin2 ` outperform the traditional estimation method .",
