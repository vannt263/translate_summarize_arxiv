    "optical images are one of the most important means used to convey information .",
    "quantum fluctuations are inevitably present in the measurement performed on each of the pixels used to record the image .",
    "this results in a deterioration in the quality of the information that can be extracted from it .",
    "quantum fluctuations depend on the characteristics of the light used in the measurement , and specifically designed non - classical states of light must be used to reduce the quantum noise , extending the limits of information read - out from these images .",
    "the study of such quantum fluctuations and correlation in images , and of their applications , is now a topic of growing attention from the quantum optics community @xcite .",
    "the implementation of a general scheme to reduce quantum noise depends largely on the specifics of the information to be extracted from the beam .",
    "for instance , in order to improve the optical resolution ( i.e. reduce the size of the minimum detail distinguishable in the image ) , one requires the use of squeezed states of light in a large number of specific transverse modes @xcite or n - photon correlated states @xcite .",
    "these states of light are typically difficult to produce . however , the problem is greatly simplified when one possesses _ a priori _ knowledge about the image to be extracted .",
    "for example , _ a postiori _ information processing performed on the intensity values measured by each pixel of the detector can be implemented .",
    "this technique is widely used when measuring the motion of a microscopic transparent particle @xcite , macro - molecule @xcite and atomic scale surface structures @xcite .",
    "such measurements can yield sensitivity in the nanometer regime , beyond the wavelength of the light used .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the specific problem of light beam positioning .",
    "the average transverse intensity of the beam is assumed to be constant , but its position and orientation in the transverse plane are unknown .",
    "such measurements are widely used in many practical applications , especially in nanotechnology , where accuracy and reproducibility of positioning at atomic scales are required .",
    "if coherent light is used , the spatial randomness of photons introduces quantum fluctuations in the position measurement .",
    "the sensitivity of positioning is then at the quantum noise limit @xcite .",
    "it was proposed theoretically @xcite and later demonstrated experimentally ( in one @xcite and two @xcite dimensions ) that this limit could be circumvented by using light that has spatial ordering of the photons .",
    "the motivation of this paper is to present an overview of optical beam positioning , clearly identify the sources of noise , and then propose ways to improve on these measurements .",
    "this will enable us to demonstrate the optimisation of the measurement strategy .",
    "we finally present a detailed account of the experiment outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , and demonstrate that simultaneous below quantum noise measurements of the beam centre for two different spatial axes are possible .",
    "in many applications , such as atomic force microscopes or photonic force microscopes @xcite , beam positioning is measured using quadrant detectors .",
    "the sum and difference photocurrents between the quadrants give information on the relative position of the beam .",
    "this measurement delivers photocurrents whose mean value is the positioning _ signal _ , and fluctuations around the mean is _ noise _ which limit the accuracy of positioning .",
    "the theoretical treatment of quantum noise arising from 1d position measurements using split detector was first examined by _",
    "fabre et al .",
    "they showed that the quantum noise could be reduced using a squeezed vacuum field in a mode with a @xmath2 phase shift between the halves impinging on each side of the split detector .",
    "fields with such characteristic phase shifts have henceforth been termed _ flipped modes_. in this article , we provide another perspective on that result , demonstrating that the quantum noise can be reduced simultaneously for several orthogonal spatial measurements performed on the beam .",
    "we use the standard description of the positive frequency part of the electric field operator @xcite , whose transverse dependence is decomposed over a complete basis of orthogonal modes @xmath3 , within the paraxial approximation @xmath4e^{-i\\omega(t - z / c)}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is along the propagation direction , @xmath6 is the two - dimensional transverse co - ordinate , @xmath7 is the annihilation operator of a photon in mode @xmath8 and the operators satisfy the commutation relation @xmath9=\\delta_{ij}\\ ] ] we then consider the slowly varying envelope @xmath10 of the field incident on a plane of longitudinal position @xmath5 ( omitted in the equations ) , which can be expressed as @xmath11 the photon number operator at a position @xmath6 of the transverse plane ( proportional to @xmath12 ) is given by @xmath13 the general study of measurements performed with several detectors on the transverse plane will be the subject of a future publication . here",
    ", we present a specific approach applicable when the difference is taken between the intensities on two spatial areas of the beam .",
    "to be more specific we will assume that the measurement consists of the difference between the left and right sides of the beam .",
    "this restriction does not affect the generality of our results , one may simply change the integration domain to adapt them to any detector shape . for a split detector ,",
    "the photon number difference is given by @xmath14 where @xmath0 is the horizontal co - ordinate and @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 this equation shows that the pertinent quantities in the calculation of noise are the overlap integrals between the different transverse modes . in order to conveniently evaluate these integrals , we will choose an adapted transverse basis as proposed in ref .",
    "the first mode in our basis is chosen to match the transverse electric field profile of the beam under interrogation , which we denote by @xmath17 ( this may not necessarily be a tem@xmath18 mode ) . since the mean value of the electric field is completely contained in @xmath19 , the subsequent modes in our basis",
    "therefore have no coherent amplitude and only contain fluctuation terms .",
    "we now choose the mode @xmath20 to be @xmath21 where @xmath20 is referred to as the _ flipped mode _ of @xmath19 .",
    "as the origin of the transverse co - ordinate @xmath22 is chosen to be the centre of the detector , the flipped mode is orthogonal to @xmath19 only in the case when the beam is centred on the detector , i.e. when the intensities on the two areas considered are equal . as we would like to measure very small displacements to this configuration , we will consider here that the beam is perfectly centred .",
    "for any given spatial basis , eq .",
    "( [ flipped ] ) can be used to generate a corresponding _ flipped mode basis_. in this basis , we have seen that the mean values of the annihilation and creation operators are zero for all the modes except @xmath23 . hence only overlap integrals that contain the first mode , @xmath24 , contribute to eq .",
    "( [ nmoins ] ) . using eq .",
    "( [ flipped ] ) , overlap integrals are given by @xmath25 which means that only @xmath26 is non - zero . the noise contribution from all other modes",
    "are zero . using the linearised approximation , the noise in the differential measurement",
    "can then be written as @xcite @xmath27 hence , noise in this measurement arises only from a given quadrature ( namely @xmath28 ) of the flipped mode .",
    "it is important to note that this calculation was performed for a beam centred at the detector .",
    "however it is still valid for displacements small compared with the beam waist .    for several simultaneous position measurements performed , for instance with a quadrant detector",
    ", one can apply the same method to show that noise arises from the corresponding flipped mode associated with the differential measurement .",
    "it is then possible to write an equation similar to eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) for each differential measurement with its corresponding flipped mode .",
    "the orthogonality ensures that the reduction of measurement noise associated with each mode can be independently performed .      for a given measurement",
    ", the precedent analysis gives the requirement for improving the sensitivity .",
    "indeed , one has to determine the flipped modes involved in the measurement .",
    "these modes have then to be produced in a squeezed vacuum in order to reduce the noise in the displacement measurement .",
    "as they are orthogonal it is possible , at least theoretically , to spatially overlap them without any losses , and then to spatially overlap the resulting beam with the beam we would like to measure .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the flipped modes are orthogonal implies that it is necessary to use as many squeezed vacuum sources as the number of measurements we would like to improve simultaneously .    several strategies can be adopted to produce low intensity squeezed beams whose transverse profile is a flipped mode . shaping the phase of an optical beam can be easily done with a phase mask",
    ". however , these devices can be lossy . as we need only to perform @xmath2 phase shifts",
    "several schemes have been proposed - one involving a half wave plate , the other a sagnac interferometer @xcite .",
    "however , other devices such as the ones used in adaptive optics can be implemented @xcite .",
    "assuming that the flipped mode can be easily produced without losses ( as was the case in our experiment ) , a sensible strategy would be to produce a squeezed beam with an optical parametric amplifier , and then reshape its phase profile .",
    "however , for more complicated schemes , another possibility could be the initial production of a coherent state in the desired transverse mode followed by squeezing using for instance a multimode optical parametric amplifier @xcite .",
    "techniques to effectively spatially overlap the modes are , in general , dependent on the specific properties of the modes involved , and can be quite complicated .",
    "however , so long as the modes involved can be easily produced with wave - plates , any two modes can be overlapped with high efficiency using the mode dependence of an optical cavity .",
    "one example of this would be to design a ring optical cavity close to transverse degeneracy , but far enough away to have a good separation of the modes .",
    "the cavity can then be tuned to be resonant for the @xmath29 mode and far off resonance for all the other modes .",
    "with reference to fig .",
    "[ cavitymixing ] , the mixing of two transverse modes can be performed in the following way .",
    "we begin with one field already in its desired mode - shape , and the other in a tem@xmath30 mode transformable to its desired mode shape using the wave - plate @xmath31 .",
    "given that we only perform phase shifts , there exists a wave - plate @xmath32 that performs the reverse operation to that performed by @xmath31 .",
    "our @xmath33 mode is transmitted through an impedance matched cavity , and the wave - plate @xmath31 is placed after the cavity to produce the desired mode . the second mode is then reflected off the empty port of the cavity output mirror .",
    "however , as the mode will also go through wave - plate @xmath31 , it is thus necessary to transmit the mode through wave - plate @xmath32 prior to the cavity .",
    "the resulting effect of the wave - plate combination @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the identity operation ) on the second mode , is a preservation of its initial mode - shape . in this way , the transmitted and reflected modes are , in principle , perfectly spatially overlapped , with losses avoided by an appropriate design for the optical cavity .",
    "other schemes to spatially overlap the beams can be proposed for specific cases .",
    "for instance , it often appears that one needs to mix an odd mode with an even mode . in this case",
    ", a mach - zehnder like interferometer can be utilised , as used in the single photon community @xcite . in that article ,",
    "the mach - zender was used as a transverse - mode beam splitter .",
    "it is possible to use it the other way around , as a lossless transverse - mode beam mixer , demonstrated in our scheme .",
    "one of the main applications of precise laser beam positioning is the measurement of physical effects coupled to the beam displacement .",
    "for instance , in atomic force microscopy , a laser beam is reflected off a cantilever and its position is recorded by a quadrant detector .",
    "one can then examine the optimal methods to extract information from the physical system using that technique .",
    "the previous calculation demonstrated that , using a coherent beam , the quantum noise in the measurement depends only on the intensity of the beam .",
    "for a given intensity , and a given detector shape , a pertinent question is : how can we obtain the largest signal , and hence the largest signal to noise ratio ?    if we consider only @xmath33 gaussian beams , we have shown in a previous publication @xcite that , in the case of a coherent state impinging on an infinitely broad split detector , the displacement corresponding to a signal to noise ratio of one is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total number of photons and @xmath38 the beam waist . given this formula , for a fixed laser intensity , it appears that the relevant quantity is the displacement divided by the beam waist . using lenses to increase the beam size ,",
    "proportionally increases the relative displacement , and therefore does not change their ratio .",
    "the consequence of this is that the precision of the measurement will remain the same .",
    "the best configuration to measure a displacement induced by a physical system is to apply the displacement to the smallest beam possible to maximise this ratio @xcite .",
    "the maximum focussing is the wavelength divided by the numerical aperture of the optical system @xcite .",
    "the smallest measurable displacement induced by a physical system coupled to a coherent laser beam is therefore given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the wavelength and @xmath41 the numerical aperture of the focussing lens .",
    "let us now consider a detector whose two halves have a finite size @xmath42 with a gap @xmath43 in between , used to measure a beam displacement .",
    "changing the beam size with lenses does not affect the precision of the measurement only in the case of an infinite detector , however here the losses induced both by the gap and the detector size are important . the best signal to",
    "noise ratio occurs when minimum loss is experienced by the beam . in this case",
    "it it therefore important to optimise the beam waist size to minimise the total losses induced by the gap and the detector edges .      in practice , at low frequencies",
    "the quantum noise limit for displacement measurements is overwhelmed by classical noise arising from acoustic or seismic vibration sources coupling to the system .",
    "therefore measurements of the amplitude of periodic displacements ( i.e. displacement modulation ) were chosen to be made at high frequencies @xmath44 where such noise sources were negligible .",
    "an electronic spectrum analyser ( esa ) can be chosen to extract the spectral power density of the displacement signal .",
    "this corresponds to a measurement of the oscillation amplitude rather than an absolute displacement .",
    "the refined task is then to measure the square of the amplitude of the periodic displacement within a small frequency range of oscillations as a function of time .",
    "an esa has two parameters that require specification ( rbw and vbw ) .",
    "the resolution bandwidth ( rbw in units of khz ) determines the small range of frequencies included in the measurement around the central frequency @xmath45 .",
    "the band - passed signal is then demodulated at @xmath45 and its amplitude detected .",
    "the measurement time @xmath46 is given by the inverse of the rbw setting .",
    "@xmath37 photons are collected in this time , setting the level of noise power measured on the esa . in the absence of displacement modulations",
    ", this level corresponds to the quantum noise , and as such is used as a reference and calibration for further displacement modulation measurements .",
    "the response of an esa is non - trivial for the combination of gaussian noise and a signal @xcite . for a displacement modulation signal @xmath47 and noise @xmath48 of the same order @xmath49 , the response of the esa in units of displacement squared",
    "may be approximated as @xmath50 .",
    "the calibration from spectral noise power to displacement is determined as follows - for a laser beam of power @xmath51 , frequency @xmath52 , waist size @xmath53 , and an esa setting of @xmath54 , the number of photons collected per measurement is given by @xmath55 , which determines @xmath56 from eq .",
    "( [ dsql ] ) .    in order to set the calibration constant , a trace from the esa was obtained where @xmath47 was kept to zero , hence giving the noise power level corresponding only to the quantum noise limit contribution .",
    "another esa trace of @xmath57 where @xmath58 was non - zero was then obtained .",
    "the smallest identifiable displacement ( @xmath59 ) can be defined in terms of the statistical confidence that a displacement modulation has been observed .",
    "one complication of using an esa to identify displacement modulations is that the video bandwidth ( vbw in units of hz ) operation of an esa sets the averaging length over several @xmath60 oscillation cycles of @xmath61 , and thus changes the time response of our displacement measurement .",
    "however , for practical applications where we require a time resolution equal to the one set by the resolution bandwidth , we simply choose the video bandwidth equal to the resolution bandwidth .    in summary ,",
    "an efficient quantum noise limited displacement modulation measurement can be achieved by carefully focusing the beam on the sample and detector , and choosing appropriate spectrum analyser settings .",
    "after optimisation of these parameters , there remain only two ways to improve the quality of the measurement - increasing the mean power or using spatial squeezing .",
    "it is the latter solution that we implement and describe in the following section .",
    "our quadrant detector , composed of a @xmath62 array of separate square detectors of side 0.5  mm and adjacent separation of 25  @xmath63 m ( epitaxx etx 505q ) , allows us to perform 4 independent measurements ( see fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) @xmath64 the first measurement , @xmath65 corresponds to the sum of the four quadrants and gives the total intensity . @xmath66 and @xmath67 correspond respectively to horizontal and vertical positioning .",
    "finally , @xmath68 , which is the difference between the two diagonal , can be interpreted , to the first order , as an orientation measurement . indeed ,",
    "if the beam is for instance elliptical , @xmath68 is zero only if the axis of the ellipse is parallel to the quadrants .",
    "to each of these measurements corresponds a flipped mode defined by eq .",
    "( [ flipped ] ) . in the case of a @xmath29 input beam ,",
    "the three flipped modes are orthogonal , and it is then possible to improve all 3 differential measurements simultaneously .",
    "we will show here how we could improve any two of them simultaneously , in a configuration easily scalable to the three measurements .",
    "experimentally , the challenges in this process are to efficiently produce the correct spatial modes , to generate a pair of squeezed fields , and to combine these fields with the coherent horizontally flipped mode with maximum efficiency . our experimental setup , which overcomes these challenges , is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .      in our experiment a 1.5  w field at 1064  nm was generated by a non - planar ring - oscillator nd : yag laser .",
    "this field was split into two roughly equal parts .",
    "one part was used to pump a second harmonic generator ( shg ) , and the other was ultimately used to seed a pair of optical parametric amplifiers ( opas ) each generating a squeezed field , and to provide the coherent horizontally flipped field .",
    "the shg was constructed from a hemi - lithic mgo:@xmath69 crystal with curved surface ar coated at 1064  nm and 532  nm , and an input / output coupling mirror with 92  % reflectivity for 1064  nm light and @xmath70  % reflectivity for 532  nm light .",
    "an electro - optical modulation was applied to the mgo:@xmath69 crystal , resulting in a phase modulation on the intra - cavity field .",
    "an error signal for the length of the cavity was extracted by detecting the light transmitted through the cavity and mixing down at the modulation frequency .",
    "the shg was non - critically phase matched by holding the temperature of the mgo:@xmath69 crystal constant at @xmath71 .",
    "at this temperature , a conversion efficiency of @xmath72  % was achieved .",
    "this resulted in 350  mw of optical power at 532  nm , which was used to pump our opas .",
    "the second 1064  nm beam was passed through a mode cleaning cavity .",
    "this cavity had a line - width of 2  mhz and so acted to filter out noise on the laser above that frequency .",
    "consequently , the output field was quantum noise limited at frequencies above @xmath73  6  mhz .",
    "it was then used to seed both of our opas and to provide the horizontally flipped coherent field .",
    "the opas were of identical design to the shg , but with higher output coupler reflectivity at 1064  nm ( 96  % ) .",
    "as with the shg , the length of each opa cavity was controlled using an error signal generated through an intra - cavity phase modulation .",
    "each opa either amplified or de - amplified its seed field , depending on the relative phase between the pump and seed .",
    "the shg phase modulation resulted in a phase modulation on the opa pump fields , and consequently a modulation of the opa amplification .",
    "for each opa , an error signal could be extracted from this modulation , locking the opa to de - amplification . in this regime",
    "the opas each produced a @xmath74w amplitude squeezed field .",
    "these squeezed fields were observed to be 4  db and 3  db below the quantum noise limit , respectively .      at this stage",
    ", we had available all of the resources required to generate a 2d spatially squeezed beam , all that remained was to appropriately modify each beam s transverse mode - shape , to generate a spatial modulation , and to spatially overlap the beams . in our experiment , for practical reasons , instead of using a tem@xmath18 laser we chose to have the mean field in a horizontally flipped mode tem@xmath75 .",
    "hence , the flipped mode for horizontal positioning is simply a tem@xmath75 mode and the one for vertical positioning is a doubly flipped mode tem@xmath76 .",
    "to summarise , we required the bright coherent field to have a horizontally phase flipped mode - shape @xmath77 , and the dim squeezed fields to have @xmath78 , and both horizontally and vertically flipped @xmath79 mode - shapes , respectively .",
    "the required mode - shape modification could be achieved by phase flipping some quadrants of each field .",
    "this phase flipping was achieved using birefringent optical half wave - plates which were cut and assembled at appropriate @xmath80 angles ( csiro lindfield australia ) .",
    "a 2-quadrant wave - plate was used on the local oscillator beam so that its mode - shape was horizontally phase flipped , while a 4-quadrant wave - plate was used on one squeezed beam so that its mode - shape was both horizontally and vertically flipped . the other squeezed beam required no modification and",
    "was maintained as a @xmath33 gaussian mode .",
    "in order to gauge the quality of the phase flipped wave - plates fabricated , we interfered the flipped modes with either another flipped mode or the @xmath33 mode ( see fig . [ interference ] ) .",
    "this was performed using a mach - zehnder interferometer setup where one arm of the interferometer had a @xmath81 wave - plate and the other arm had either a @xmath82 wave - plate or no wave - plate .",
    "the input modes at the interferometer were of equal optical power and by scanning the relative phase between the beams in the two arms , interference fringes on each quadrant of the 4-quadrant detector ( labelled @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 here as defined in fig .",
    "[ interference ] ) were observed .",
    "we quantified the quality of the mode - matching via the interference fringe visibility @xmath87 where @xmath88 indicates perfect mode - matching and @xmath89 indicates no mode - matching .    when a @xmath33 mode was interfered with a horizontally flipped mode ( as shown in fig .",

    "since squeezing is highly sensitive to inefficiencies , it was critical that the efficiency of the process overlapping the squeezed modes was high .",
    "an element that accurately distinguished between different spatial modes was required to achieve this high efficiency . in our case",
    "we chose a specially designed optical cavity in a ring configuration as this element .",
    "cavities constructed using spherical mirrors decompose incident light fields into the tem@xmath98 modes .",
    "the gouy phase shift between the tem@xmath99 modes typically ensures that for a given cavity length some tem@xmath98 modes will be resonant , and others entirely non - resonant . in our case",
    ", we designed the cavity to be impedance matched , and have relatively low finesse ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the input and output couplers had 95  % reflectivity and the third mirror was hr coated .",
    "in this regime losses in the cavity were small compared to the input and output coupling , and resonant incident modes were transmitted with high efficiency . with a cavity length of 200  mm controlled such that the tem@xmath18 mode was resonant ,",
    "our tem@xmath18 squeezed beam was transmitted with @xmath101  % efficiency and a line - width of 25  mhz .",
    "we were interested in squeezing at sideband frequencies of @xmath102  mhz .",
    "this is well below the line - width of the cavity , ensuring efficient transmission of our squeezing .",
    "let us now consider the tem@xmath76 squeezed mode interacting with the cavity . since the cavity was in a ring configuration , reflection of this mode from the cavity output coupling mirror with appropriate imaging lenses achieved the desired spatial overlap with the transmitted tem@xmath18 mode ( see fig .",
    "[ cavitymixing ] ) . of course ,",
    "for this reflection to be efficient the tem@xmath76 had to be far way from the cavity resonance .",
    "the resonance condition of the tem@xmath76 mode for the ring - cavity can be examined by first expanding it in the @xmath103 basis @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "notice that there is no contribution to the tem@xmath76 mode from the tem@xmath18 mode .",
    "thus , these two modes are orthogonal , and there is no fundamental limitation on the efficiency with which they can be spatially overlapped . a number of cavity designs exist for which this overlap , in principle , approaches 100  % efficiency .",
    "the crucial factor is that when the tem@xmath18 mode is on resonance , all higher order tem@xmath98 mode with significantly large occupation @xmath107 are far off resonance . in the limit of high cavity finesse",
    "this condition is naturally satisfied .    in our case , however , a relatively low cavity finesse was chosen to ensure the efficient transmission of squeezing at 5  mhz on the tem@xmath18 squeezed mode . in this case ,",
    "a careful analysis of the resonance condition of each of the significant higher order tem@xmath99 modes is required . for each mode",
    ", this resonance condition is dictated by the gouy phase shift experienced by the modes , which can be optimised for a given cavity length through an appropriate choice of the radii of curvature of the cavity mirrors .",
    "for our cavity the input / output coupling mirrors were chosen to be flat and the third mirror to have a radius of curvature of 250  mm . with the cavity length controlled",
    "so that the tem@xmath18 mode was resonant , all higher order modes with @xmath108 were efficiently reflected .",
    "the contribution to our tem@xmath76 mode from tem modes with @xmath109 was insignificant with @xmath110 in all cases . for our cavity configuration ,",
    "therefore , the tem@xmath76 mode was efficiently reflected .",
    "we directly observed an efficiency @xmath111% for this process .",
    "[ cavity ] shows a comparison of the predicted and experimentally observed cavity reflection for a tem@xmath76 mode as a function of the cavity resonance condition .",
    "the cavity resonance condition was scanned by ramping the cavity length using a piezo - electric actuator ( pzt ) attached to the curved cavity mirror .",
    "when a tem@xmath98 mode was resonant , it was almost entirely transmitted , and the reflected power from the cavity dropped in consequence .",
    "the magnitude of the intensity drop was directly proportional to @xmath107 .",
    "[ cavity ] , therefore , illustrates the significance of each of the lower - order tem@xmath98 modes constituting the tem@xmath76 mode . the highest contribution came from the tem@xmath112 mode , and the significance of the modes dropped rapidly as @xmath113 increased . a comparison of fig .",

    "all that remained to generate a 2d spatially squeezed beam was to spatially overlap this combined beam with our bright coherent tem@xmath75 mode . since the second order statistical moments of coherent fields are insensitive to attenuation , this overlap could be achieved by utilising a 95/5 beam splitter .",

    "the level of squeezing exhibited by our spatially squeezed beam was examined by imaging the mode onto a quadrant detector .",
    "the horizontal beam displacement fluctuation was obtained by taking the difference between the photocurrents originating from the left and right halves of the quadrant detector , and the vertical beam displacement fluctuation was obtained from the difference of the photocurrents from the top and bottom halves of the detector .",

    "these measurements were limited to the quantum noise level as shown by the black trace in fig .",
    "[ result1 ] . introducing the squeezed fields , we observed simultaneous squeezing of both the horizontal and vertical displacement fluctuations as shown by the colour ( grey ) traces in fig .",
    "[ result1 ] .",
    "the optimum simultaneous squeezing for the vertical and horizontal displacement fluctuations were 2.0@xmath1160.1  db and 3.05@xmath1160.1  db , respectively .",
    "this corresponded to a reduction in the displacement fluctuations of the vertical and horizontal axes by 37  % and 50  % , respectively , with respect to the quantum noise level .          with a reduction in the noise levels of both the horizontal and vertical axes to below the quantum noise limit",
    ", we now examine the effects of an externally applied displacement modulation on the spatially squeezed beam .",
    "spatial squeezing should improve the resolution with which this modulation can be analysed .",
    "the external displacement modulation was applied to the @xmath81 local oscillator beam by reflecting the beam from a @xmath117 angled mirror mounted on a pzt modulated at 4.976  mhz .",
    "the pzt consisted of a stack of piezo - electric crystals .",
    "when a voltage was applied across the pzt , the pzt not only contracted / expanded in the principal axis but also tilted at an angle away from the principal axis .",
    "the resulting transverse modulation from the pzt was a diagonal displacement modulation , with horizontal and vertical components .    in order to demonstrate an improvement in the resolution measurement of our 2-dimensional spatially squeezed beam , we compared the results of a displacement modulation measurement between a coherent beam and our spatially squeezed beam .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ result2 ] .",
    "the squeezing levels obtained for the horizontal and vertical axes were 2.84  db and 1.80  db , respectively .",
    "the broad peak corresponded to the measured displacement modulation signal and we measured our signal to noise ratio ( snr ) from the maximum of the signal peak to the noise floor . for the quantum noise limited coherent beam ( curve ( i ) ) , the measured snr for the horizontal and vertical axes were 2.8 and 1.4 . for the 2-dimensional spatially squeezed beam ( curve ( ii ) ) , the measured snr for the horizontal and vertical axes were 5.2 and 1.9 .",
    "the improvement in the measurement of the displacement modulation signal obtained from the spatially squeezed beam over the coherent beam is given by the ratio of @xmath118 .",
    "the respective ratios obtained for the horizontal and vertical axes were 1.9 and 1.4 .",
    "we also examined the effects of ramping the displacement modulation amplitude over time . to determine the displacement modulation amplitude at an analysis frequency @xmath119",
    ", the photocurrents from the quadrant detector were analysed using a spectrum analyser .",
    "the spectrum analyser demodulated the modulation signal and then performed a measurement of the power spectral density .",
    "the displayed information was the sum of the squares of the quantum noise without modulation @xmath120 and the small transverse beam position modulation @xmath121 - i.e. @xmath122 ( see fig .",
    "[ noise]a ) . curve ( i ) is the result of the measurement performed using a coherent state and thus is the best classical measurement . curve ( ii ) was obtained by performing the same measurement , but with a spatially squeezed beam instead .",
    "@xmath123 per data point.,width=283 ]    the data obtained in fig .",
    "[ noise]a was then normalised to the respective noise levels for the coherent and the spatially squeezed beams , shown in fig .",
    "[ noise]b .",
    "the vertical axis is the difference between the measured signal , and noise without displacement .",
    "for the spatially squeezed beam the average of the signal trace crosses the threshold of confidence for a smaller modulation amplitude than for the coherent beam . the corresponding oscillation amplitude for the spatially squeezed and coherent beams were found to be 1.6    and 2.3    at the 99  % confidence level .",
    "thus the improvement for the spatially squeezed beam was a factor of 1.5 over the quantum noise limited coherent beam . since both traces increased linearly with the modulation amplitude , this improvement factor was independent of the choice of confidence levels .    for the sake of brevity",
    ", we have only included the results for the horizontal axis .",
    "it should be realised that an equivalent improvement for two simultaneous measurements performed in two orthogonal quadratures on the spatially squeezed beam has been achieved .",
    "an intuitive visualisation of our 2d spatial squeezed beam was obtained by analysing the vertical and horizontal normalised amplitude quadratures on a correlation diagram . to do this ,",
    "simultaneous measurements of the horizontal and vertical beam displacements were required .",
    "we achieved these measurements using a pair of simultaneously triggered spectrum analysers with identical settings .",
    "the results for the two axes could then be plotted against each other in conventional correlation diagrams .",
    "[ correlation ] shows the resulting correlation diagrams for a quantum noise limited beam ( fig .",
    "[ correlation ]  a ) and our spatially squeezed beam ( fig .",
    "[ correlation ]  b ) .",
    "each point in these diagrams can be interpreted as an instantaneous 2d measurement of the fluctuations of the displacement modulation .",
    "the standard deviation as a function of modulation angle could be calculated for each correlation diagram , and is displayed by the ellipses in the figure .",
    "we can directly see that the average displacement modulation fluctuation for all angles is smaller with our spatially squeezed beam than with a coherent beam .",
    "specifically , for the horizontal and vertical axes , the average fluctuation is reduced by a factor of 0.78 and 0.75 , respectively .",
    "the square of these values give the fluctuation variances of 2.2  db and 2.5  db for the horizontal and vertical axes , respectively .",
    "the ellipses in fig .",
    "[ correlation ] also allow an analysis of any correlation present between the horizontal and vertical displacement fluctuations .",
    "since in both cases the major and minor ellipse axes correspond well to the horizontal and vertical displacement axes , it is clear that no cross - axis correlation exists .",
    "sign at the centre of plot a. the blue and red circles indicate the standard deviations for the quantum noise and squeezing data , respectively .",
    "re - scaling was implemented such that the quantum noise standard deviation equalled one .",
    "the two spectrum analysers had settings of 0  hz span at 4.976  mhz , rbw = vbw = 1  khz , averaged over 6 traces.,width=321 ]      as discussed in the theory section , simultaneous enhancement of any two orthogonal spatial properties of a beam is possible given access to sufficient squeezing resources , and the ability to choose and combine appropriate spatial modes . in this section ,",
    "we demonstrate that principle by simultaneously generating horizontal and diagonal spatial squeezing , contrasting the horizontal / vertical spatial squeezing discussed throughout the majority of this paper .",
    "our bright coherent beam and tem@xmath18 squeezed beam were maintained in their original modes , and the 4-quadrant wave - plate in the tem@xmath76 squeezed beam was replaced by a 2-quadrant wave - plate , rotated by @xmath124 relative to the wave - plate for the coherent beam .",
    "this transformed the tem@xmath76 squeezed beam to a vertically flipped @xmath125 mode .",
    "so that , in this case , the beams involved were a bright coherent horizontally flipped @xmath90 beam , a vertically flipped @xmath125 squeezed beam and a @xmath33 squeezed beam . to measure the diagonal axis modulation displacement , the photocurrents from diagonal detector quadrants",
    "were summed , and the difference of the two resulting photon currents were analysed in a spectrum analyser .",
    "the resulting horizontal and diagonal displacement modulation spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ result3 ] .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the horizontal and diagonal axes were simultaneously squeezed by 2.2  db and 1.8  db , respectively .",
    "this corresponded to displacement fluctuation reductions with respect to quantum noise of 40  % and 34  % , for the horizontal and diagonal axes respectively .          in our original one",
    "dimensional ( 1d ) spatial squeezing work reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spatially squeezed beam was produced by overlapping a squeezed @xmath33 beam and a bright coherent @xmath81 beam using a 95/5 beamsplitter .",
    "the choice of 95  % reflectivity was motivated by the requirement to minimise loss in the @xmath33 squeezed beam , while ensuring a significant fraction of the coherent beam was transmitted . however , this resulted in an attenuation of the displacement signal encoded on the coherent beam , so that the achievable signal - to - noise ratio was lower than would be possible if the spatial overlap was achieved efficiently .",
    "we repeated that original experiment , using our cavity to efficiently spatially overlap the two beams .",
    "this resulted in a 1d spatially squeezed beam with minimal losses for both the squeezed and coherent beams .",
    "the measured squeezing was 2.5  db , which was also an improvement on the value of 2.34  db reported in ref .",
    "in this paper we have investigated , both theoretically and experimentally , the optimum displacement measurements that can be performed using a detector array .",
    "we demonstrated that , splitting the array into two arbitrary areas with equal optical power on each , enhancement of the difference measurement between the halves could be achieved using a @xmath2 phase - flipped squeezed mode .",
    "the location of the @xmath2 phase - flip was dictated by the detector areas under investigation .",
    "we then showed that an arbitrary number of such measurements could be enhanced simultaneously using multiple squeezed beams , so long as the squeezed beams had orthogonal spatial modes .    in our experiment , we were interested in enhancing measurements performed using an array detector with only four pixels , or in other words , a quadrant detector .",
    "such measurements can be interpreted as displacement measurements , and have many applications .",
    "our aim was to use squeezing to achieve simultaneous squeezing of multiple displacement measurements .",
    "one of the primary experimental challenges was to develop methods to spatially overlap two beams with orthogonal spatial modes efficiently .",
    "we achieved this overlap with approximately 95  % efficiency using a specially designed optical resonator .",
    "we used this resonator to spatially overlap a pair of quadrature squeezed beams with specifically configured mode - shapes . combining the resulting beam with a bright coherent beam , also with a specific mode - shape , produced a 2d spatially squeezed beam .",
    "this was demonstrated by simultaneous below shot noise fluctuations in both horizontal and vertical displacement measurements when the beam was imaged onto our quadrant detector .",
    "we introduced a spatial modulation to the beam and demonstrated that , using spatial squeezing , a modulation amplitude of 1.6    could be detected with 99  % confidence , a coherent beam , on the other hand , could only detect modulations with amplitude greater than 2.3   . to illustrate the generality of out results",
    ", we also demonstrated that horizontal and diagonal displacement measurements could be simultaneously enhanced .",
