    "the theory of @xmath0-categories , first developed by ghez , lima and roberts  @xcite in the mid - eighties , has found several useful applications during the last decades .",
    "most notably , it has been used by doplicher and roberts @xcite in the development of a duality theory for compact groups with important applications in algebraic quantum field theory and by davis and lck @xcite in order to include the baum - connes conjecture into their influential unified treatment of the @xmath7-theoretic isomorphism conjectures . several authors  see @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite   have subsequently picked up these strands of ideas and employed @xmath0-categories in various operator - theoretic contexts , often in relation to kasparov s @xmath8-theory . in most of the above situations @xmath0-categories are only to be considered up to _ morita equivalence _ , the natural extension of the classical notion of morita(-rieffel ) equivalence between @xmath0-algebras .",
    "hence it is of key importance to development the foundations of a morita theory of @xmath0-categories .    a @xmath9-functor @xmath10 between @xmath0-categories",
    "is called a _ morita equivalence _ if it induces an equivalence @xmath11 on the completions of @xmath12 and @xmath13 under finite direct sums and retracts .",
    "this operation @xmath14 , named _ saturation _ , can easily be performed without leaving the world of @xmath0-categories ; see   [ subsec : saturated ] .",
    "the first named author has initiated in  @xcite the study of @xmath0-categories via homotopy - theoretic methods , in particular by constructing the unitary model structure , where the weak equivalences are the unitary equivalences of @xmath0-categories . in the present article",
    "we take a leap forward in the same direction by establishing the foundations of the morita homotopy theory of @xmath0-categories . our first main result , which summarizes theorem  [ thm : morita_model ] , propositions [ prop : monoidal ] , [ prop : simplicial ] and [ prop : bousfield ] , and corollary  [ cor : fibrant_replacement ] , is the following :    [ thm : main1 ] the category @xmath2 of ( small unital ) @xmath0-categories and ( identity preserving ) @xmath9-functors admits a quillen model structure whose weak equivalences are the morita equivalences and whose cofibrations are the @xmath9-functors which are injective on objects .",
    "moreover , this model structure is cofibrantly generated , symmetric monoidal , simplicial , and is endowed with a functorial fibrant replacement given by the saturation functor .",
    "furthermore , it is a left bousfield localization of the unitary model structure .",
    "we have named this quillen model the _ morita model category _ of @xmath0-categories ( and denoted it by @xmath1 ) since two unital @xmath0-algebras become isomorphic in the associated homotopy category @xmath4 if and only if they are morita equivalent ( @xmath15  morita - rieffel equivalent ) in the usual sense ; see proposition  [ prop : morita_agreement ] .",
    "the morita homotopy category @xmath4 becomes then the natural setting where to formalize and study all `` up to morita equivalence '' phenomena .",
    "as an example we obtain an elegant conceptual description of the picard group ( see  [ sec : pic ] ) .",
    "[ prop : pic ] for every unital @xmath0-algebra  @xmath12 there is a canonical isomorphism @xmath16 between its automorphism group in the morita homotopy category and its picard group @xmath17 , as originally defined by brown - green - rieffel in @xcite using imprimitivity bimodules .    as a consequence ,",
    "the left - hand - side of furnishes us with a simple morita invariant definition of the picard group of _ any _ @xmath0-category .",
    "our second main result , which summarizes theorems  [ thm : semi - additive ] and  [ thm : map_sum ] , proposition  [ prop : morphisms_morita ] , and corollary  [ cor : new ] , is the following :    [ thm : main2 ] the homotopy category @xmath4 is _ semi - additive _ ,  it has a zero object , finite products , finite coproducts , and the canonical map from the coproduct to the product is an isomorphism .",
    "its hom - sets admit the following description @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the @xmath0-category of @xmath3-functors from @xmath12 to the saturation of  @xmath13 and the equivalence relation @xmath20 on objects is unitary isomorphism .",
    "moreover , the canonical abelian monoid structure thereby obtained on each hom - set @xmath21 is induced by the direct sum operation on  @xmath22 .    intuitively speaking , theorem",
    "[ thm : main2 ] shows us that by forcing morita invariance we obtain a local abelian monoid structure . by group completing each hom monoid we obtain then an additive category @xmath5 and hence a composed functor @xmath23 consult  [ sec : k0 ] for details .",
    "our third main result ( see theorem  [ thm : characterization ] ) is the following :    [ thm : main3 ] the canonical functor @xmath24 takes values in an additive category , inverts morita equivalences , preserves all finite products , and is universal among all functors having these three properties .",
    "our last main result , collecting theorem [ thm : co - representability ] and proposition [ prop : ring_comm ] , provides a precise link between our theory and the @xmath7-theory of @xmath0-algebras .",
    "note that , since @xmath1 is symmetric monoidal , its tensor structure descends to @xmath4 and then extends easily to the group completion @xmath5 .",
    "[ thm : main4 ] for every unital @xmath0-algebra  @xmath12 there is a canonical isomorphism @xmath25 of abelian groups , where the right - hand - side denotes the classical grothendieck group of  @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath26 is moreover commutative , the usual ring structure on @xmath27 ( induced by the tensor product of vector bundles ) coincides with the to one obtained on the left - hand - side by considering @xmath12 as a ring object in the symmetric monoidal category @xmath5 .    as a consequence the left - hand - side of provides us with an elegant morita invariant definition of the grothendieck group of _ any _ @xmath0-category .",
    "note that by theorem  [ thm : main3 ] this definition is completely characterized by a simple universal property . in remark  [ remark : ktheory ] we compare our approach with those of other authors .",
    "we use the symbol  @xmath28 to denote the base field , which is fixed and is either @xmath29 or  @xmath30 . except when stated otherwise , all @xmath0-categories are _ small _ ( they have a set  as opposed to a class  of objects ) and _ unital _ ( they have an identity arrow @xmath31 for each object  @xmath32 ) .",

    "since @xmath45 preserves products and inverts morita equivalences , we obtain the following isomorphism @xmath788_-{\\sim } &     f(a^\\natural_\\oplus ) \\times f(b^\\natural_\\oplus ) \\ar[rr]_-\\sim^-{(f\\iota \\times f\\iota)^{-1 } } & &     f(a ) \\times f(b ) } \\ ] ] between objects of  @xmath789 . as explained in the proof of theorem  [ thm : semi - additive ] , @xmath790 is the product of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in @xmath4 . as a consequence",
    "we observe that @xmath791 preserves products and thus that it is an additive functor .",
    "similarly , @xmath527 preserves the final object @xmath792 .",
    "hence , since @xmath789 is additive , we conclude that @xmath527 is additive .",
    "finally , a straightforward verification shows that the assignment @xmath793 gives rise to a functor which is quasi - inverse to .",
    "it is well - known that it does not matter whether we consider  @xmath12 as a unital @xmath0-algebra  and then compute its grothendieck group in terms of projections or hilbert modules  or as an ordinary algebra  and then compute its grothendieck group via idempotents or finitely generated projective modules . in the present paper",
    ", we have already seen an incarnation of this fact in remark  [ remark : idemp_agreement ] .",
    "( this of course ceases to be true for the higher @xmath7-theory groups ) .",
    "for the proof it will be convenient to use the customary picture of @xmath27 in terms of projections ; see  @xcite*4 . thus @xmath27 is the group completion of the abelian monoid @xmath795 of projections in the nonunital @xmath9-algebra @xmath796 with respect to the orthogonal sum @xmath797 $ ] and modulo unitary equivalence of projections , where @xmath65 and  @xmath153 are unitarily equivalent if and only if there exists a unitary matrix @xmath798 such that @xmath799 ( here we are considering @xmath800 as a subalgebra of @xmath801 via the corner inclusion @xmath802 $ ] ) .",
    "it is now clear that every element @xmath803 $ ] of @xmath804 corresponds to a unique ( unitary ) isomorphism class of objects in @xmath168 , and therefore , by proposition  [ prop : morphisms_morita ] , to a unique element of @xmath805 .",
    "hence we obtain a bijection @xmath806 which moreover identifies the sum operations  @xmath807 and the zero elements  @xmath79 of both sides .",
    "thus is an isomorphism of abelian monoids . by group",
    "completion we obtain then the required isomorphism , which moreover is natural with respect to unital @xmath9-homomorphisms (  @xmath9-functors ) @xmath808 .    [ remark : ktheory ] theorem [ thm : co - representability ] leads us naturally to define @xmath809 for every small unital @xmath0-category @xmath12 .",
    "one can already find in the literature a few definitions of the @xmath810-group of a @xmath0-category .",
    "hence let us briefly compare our definition with some of the extant ones .    1 .",
    "by forgetting structure , every ( additive ) @xmath0-category is a banach category and so one can study its topological @xmath7-theory in the sense of karoubi @xcite for which @xmath27 is simply the grothendieck group of  @xmath12 seen as an additive category .",
    "thus the group agrees with karoubi s @xmath810-group of  @xmath168 .",
    "in fact , for the purposes of karoubi s @xmath7-theory , banach categories are naturally assumed to be additive and idempotent complete .",
    "this provided the original motivation for defining the idempotent complete ( `` pseudo - abelian '' ) hull of an additive category .",
    "davis and lck  @xcite have introduced a nonconnective topological @xmath7-theory spectrum functorially associated to a @xmath0-category  @xmath12 .",
    "unfortunately , as pointed out in  @xcite , this spectrum is not well - defined because of a common mistake explained by thomason in @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , their @xmath810-group still makes sense and is defined to be @xmath811 ,  the path components of the classifying space of the quillen - grothendieck completion of the symmetric monoidal groupoid of isomorphisms in @xmath168 ; see @xcite*page217 .",
    "this is easily seen to be the grothendieck group of @xmath812 and thus coincides with .",
    "3 .   in order to circumvent the davis - lck construction ,",
    "joachim @xcite and mitchener @xcite have defined topological @xmath7-theory spectra ( and therefore @xmath7-theory groups ) for a @xmath0-category  @xmath12 by means of hilbert modules over  @xmath12 with additional data .",
    "both definitions are related to @xmath8-theory , which gives them a strong analytical flavor .",
    "it is unclear to the authors , even for @xmath810 , whether they agree with each other and with , although we expect this to be the case at least for a gentle enough @xmath0-category @xmath12 .",
    "kandelaki @xcite has adapted karoubi s @xmath7-theory to @xmath0-categories , and used it to compute kasparov groups @xmath813 as the @xmath7-groups of suitable saturated @xmath0-categories @xmath814 . here",
    "@xmath810 of a @xmath0-category  @xmath12 ( with direct sums ) is defined to be the grothendieck group of the abelian monoid of unitary isomorphism classes of its objects .",
    "therefore here too our group agrees with @xmath815 .",
    "[ lemma : add_tensor ] let @xmath817 be a semi - additive category @xmath689 endowed with a symmetric monoidal structure whose tensor product is additive in each variable . then , the associated additive category @xmath767 is endowed with a unique symmetric monoidal structure which is again additive in both variables .",
    "moreover , the canonical functor @xmath770 is strict symmetric monoidal .",
    "since @xmath767 is additive , proposition [ prop : universal ] applied to the semi - additive category @xmath818 implies that the functor @xmath819 admits a unique extension along @xmath820 . by composing it with the canonical isomorphism @xmath821",
    "we obtain a tensor product on @xmath767 : @xmath822_{\\alpha\\times\\alpha } \\ar[r]^-\\otimes \\ar[d]^\\alpha & { \\mathcal{c}}\\ar[d]^{\\alpha }   \\\\   { \\mathcal{c}}^{-1 } \\times { \\mathcal{c}}^{-1 } \\ar@/_3ex/[rr]_-\\otimes \\ar[r]^-\\simeq & ( { \\mathcal{c}}\\times { \\mathcal{c}})^{-1 } \\ar@{ .. >}[r]^-{\\exists ! } & { \\mathcal{c}}^{-1 } \\ , . } \\ ] ] when combined with @xmath823 and with ( the images in @xmath767 of ) the coherence isomorphisms of @xmath824 , this data specifies a symmetric monoidal structure as required .    by combining corollary [ cor : ho_tensor ] and lemma [ lemma : add_tensor ] we obtain on @xmath5 a well - defined symmetric monoidal structure  @xmath596",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be two @xmath0-categories . making use of this tensor product and of the natural isomorphisms",
    "we obtain a well - defined external pairing @xmath825    when @xmath826 is a commutative unital @xmath0-algebra , the multiplication map @xmath827 is a @xmath9-homomorphism , which extends uniquely to the @xmath0-algebraic tensor product @xmath828 . by @xcite*proposition 2.13 ,",
    "the usual maximal tensor product of two unital @xmath0-algebras coincides with their maximal tensor product when considered as @xmath0-categories .",
    "hence by applying @xmath829 to the @xmath9-functor @xmath830 we obtain an induced homorphism @xmath831 which we may then compose with to obtain a well - defined multiplication : @xmath832    [ prop : ring_comm ] let @xmath26 be a unital commutative @xmath0-algebra",
    ". then the multiplication map   identifies with the usual ring structure of @xmath27 induced by the tensor product of vector bundles .",
    "the multiplication in terms of vector bundles is the composition of the map @xmath833 , induced by the diagonal embedding @xmath834 , with the map @xmath835 induced by the external tensor product of vector bundles ; here @xmath836 denotes the grothendieck group of the additive category of vector bundles . via the swan - serre theorem and theorem [ thm : co - representability ] , the former identifies with and the latter with  .",
