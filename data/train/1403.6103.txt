    "the result of @xmath135 in the limit of strong disorder results from the complete decoupling of afm and sc orders since in this limit @xmath136 . note that our findings also imply the possibility of a disorder - induced transition from mutual exclusion to coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in the iron pnictides .",
    "these findings are summarized in fig .",

    "our treatment of the problem with a finite interband scattering rate @xmath61 in eilenberger formalism@xcite is analogous to the approach described in ref .  , and we consider a model with finite interband scattering rate @xmath61 and equal intraband scattering rates @xmath137 in the hole and electron bands as well .",
    "this approach allows for the expansion of the sc and afm gap equations which can , up to a factor , be identified with the first derivative of the free energy with respect to the order parameters .",
    "we extract the coefficients of the free energy expansion from the expanded gap equations . in presence of interband scattering , the coefficients contributing to the quantity @xmath138 which determines the nature of the multicritical point , read    @xmath139 \\nonumber \\\\       & \\qquad -\\tfrac{2{\\rho_{\\mathrm{f}}}\\tau_0}{\\pi t}\\left[\\left(1+t\\right)\\operatorname{\\psi_1}\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1+t}{4\\pi t\\tau_0}\\right)+t\\operatorname{\\psi_1}\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{t}{4\\pi t\\tau_{0}}\\right)\\right ]      { ~ , } \\\\      \\gamma_{++}&= -\\tfrac{8{\\rho_{\\mathrm{f}}}\\tau_0 ^ 2}{(1+t)^2}\\left[\\operatorname{\\psi_0}\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1+t}{4\\pi t\\tau_0}\\right)-\\operatorname{\\psi_0}\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\right ]       -\\tfrac{2{\\rho_{\\mathrm{f}}}\\tau_0}{\\pi t}\\tfrac{1}{1+t}\\left[\\operatorname{\\psi_1}\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1+t}{4\\pi t\\tau_0}\\right)-2\\operatorname{\\psi_1}\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\right ]      { ~ , } \\label{eq : interband - gamma++ }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath140 is the ratio of interband to intraband scattering rate . in the limit of @xmath92 ,",
    "this corresponds to the results discussed in section  [ sec : intraband ] , but with the intraband scattering rate doubled , since now the scattering rate in the electron band is finite , and equal to the scattering rate in the hole band .",
    "again , we find that afm and @xmath1  sc decouple in the limit of @xmath141 ( @xmath135 ) , resulting in a phase diagram exhibiting a region where afm and sc coexist microscopically whereas for @xmath0  sc , @xmath142 , and afm and sc exclude each other .        for finite interband scattering rates , afm and sc no longer decouple completely in the limit of strong disorder but the coupling @xmath143 is reduced in the case of @xmath1  pairing compared to the clean case .",
    "the stronger interband scattering is , the closer @xmath133 is to zero , but for all ratios @xmath144 we found @xmath145 , implying a phase diagram with a tetracritical point and coexistence of sc and afm .",
    "for @xmath0  pairing , in contrast , we find @xmath146 and @xmath147 , irrespective of the ratio  @xmath67 .",
    "furthermore , we found that in case of @xmath0  pairing , the interband scattering simply adds to the intraband scattering rate .",
    "thus , the qualitative behavior does not depend on @xmath67 , and we find @xmath148 , thus @xmath0  sc is not able to coexist microscopically with afm , not even in the presence of inter- and/or intraband scattering .",
    "these results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : result - interband ] .    in conclusion , for the @xmath1  pairing state , intraband scattering and interband scattering are antagonistic processes , but the effect of intraband scattering is always stronger , even in the limit of @xmath149 , whereas for the @xmath0  pairing state , the rates of these two scattering processes simply add up .",
    "thus in the presence of interband scattering , we find the @xmath0 pairing state to be inconsistent with phase diagrams revealing a regime of microscopic coexistence of afm and sc .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath1  state , in contrast , suggests that this order parameter symmetry will always result in a phase diagram exhibiting a regime of coexistence of afm and sc .",
    "still , a more detailed analysis including finite ellipticity and/or chemical potential could also lead to @xmath14 , thus allowing for both types of phase diagrams . since ellipticity and chemical potential yield only small corrections",
    ", they could not bring the @xmath0  state to coexists with magnetic order .",
    "therefore , the analysis of finite inter- and intraband scattering supports the reasoning based on phase competition against the @xmath0 as a suitable candidate for the pairing state in iron pnictides .",
    "we studied a model of iron pnictides and related iron - based superconductors and included impurity scattering in the microscopic model .",
    "we developed two complementary simplified models for impurity scattering in the iron pnictides motivated by experimental observations .",
    "model  a concentrates on the most important scattering process in the materials under consideration which is intraband scattering in the hole band .",
    "therefore , we neglected intraband scattering in the electron band and all types of interband scattering processes , since @xmath150 . model  b focuses on the interband scattering rate , neglected in model  a , yet makes the simplifying assumption that the intraband scattering rates of both bands are the same .",
    "we derived the full ginzburg - landau expansion of the free energy from this microscopic model . from the quadratic coefficients we find that the transition temperature of neither @xmath0 nor @xmath1  superconductivity is influenced by impurity scattering if we take only intraband scattering into account .",
    "this is in accordance with the anderson theorem . we further compared the coherence lengths obtained from the gradient terms in the expansion and found the coherence length of the magnetic order parameter more strongly reduced by impurity scattering than the coherence length of the superconducting order parameter .    from the quartic coefficients we concluded how impurity scattering affects the phase competition in the iron pnictides .",
    "our analysis supports the argument obtained in the clean case@xcite that @xmath0  superconductivity is inconsistent with phase diagrams that show microscopic coexistence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity .",
    "this behaviour occurs in models with and without interband scattering .",
    "thus the consideration of disorder provides an even stronger argument against the @xmath0 state to be realized in the iron pnictides and supports @xmath1  superconductivity or other sign - changing superconducting states .",

    "to illustrate the calculation of the diagrams for the coefficients in the free energy , let us provide here a detailed computation of the coefficient @xmath151 in the framework of our simplified model . in the absence of interband scattering",
    "there is one diagram that contributes to the coefficient @xmath151 . in the following ,",

    "the application of the eilenberger formalism to a system showing antiferromagnetism and @xmath1  superconductivity can be done in complete analogy to ref .  , using the same parametrization of the eilenberger green s function . in this appendix , we sketch the respective procedure for @xmath0  superconductivity . the mean - field hamiltonian can be written as @xmath158 where we summarized the fermionic operators in the two bands into @xmath159 and introduced the hamiltonian matrix consisting of noninteracting and mean - field parts , @xmath160 where @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 are the pauli matrices in nambu , band , and spin space , respectively .",

    ", we find self - consistently that for our model , the eilenberger green s function must be of the form @xmath168 this parametrization can be used to obtain an expansion of the gap equations for the order parameters @xmath9 and @xmath169 .",
    "such an expansion corresponds , up to an overall prefactor , to the first derivative of the free energy with respect to the order parameter , i.e. , the equation of state .",
    "therefore , we can extract the quadratic and quartic coefficients of the free - energy expansion .    by using the parametrization   in the self energy  ,",
    "we find that the self energy depends on intraband and interband scattering rate only via the total scattering rate @xmath170 for the @xmath0  pairing state .",
    "thus we expect no qualitatively new effects due to interband scattering here that were not already captured in the analysis of intraband scattering ."
