    "hence , the origin of de nuclei is generally reconducted to two possible mechanisms , both related to massive star clusters , e.g. ( a ) the decay of the orbit of a pre - existing globular toward the tip of the galactic potential well , driven by dynamical friction , or ( b ) the _ in situ _ formation of a giant cluster from gas fallen to the center of the galaxy ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we fully resolve , for the first time , the structure of the overdensity of sgr stars around m  54 , showing that sgr would appear nucleated independently of the presence of m  54 .",

    "this effect is somewhat obvious in the case of the m  54 and ms samples ( lower panels ) , which are dominated or at least largely contaminated by m  54 stars . on the other hand ,",
    "such a sharp concentration around m  54 is unexpected in the case of the sgr and bp samples ( upper panels ) where the contamination from m  54 stars is virtually negligible .    .",
    "in each panel the tidal radius of m  54 ( @xmath8=7@xmath5.5 ) is marked .",
    "the _  holes \" _ in the center of the right - hand panels are due to incompleteness effects .",
    ", width=317 ]    in figure [ duebis ] we show isodensity contours for m  54 ( light grey continuous curves ) and sgr ( heavy dotted - dashed curves ) .",
    "each contour set is normalized to the respective maximum density and for each sample we show isodensity curves ranging from 10% to the 90% of the peak value , in steps of 10% .",
    "the plotted area covers approximately @xmath9 .",
    "the m  54 contours show a compact , strongly peaked , symmetric structure , typical of a globular cluster .",
    "the surprising feature of figure [ duebis ] is that sgr shows a very similar structure centered ( at the best of our resolution , i.e. 6@xmath10 ) exactly on m  54 .",
    "the scale length of the sgr overdensity can be best appreciated by examining the radial density profile .",
    "density profiles are obtained by dividing the surveyed area into quadrants and by computing the density of stars ( star counts / area ) for each quadrant in annuli of variable dimension . for each annulus , the densities in the quadrants",
    "are then averaged to give the final density and standard deviation on the density estimates .",
    "we applied this procedure to stars in the m  54 and in the _",
    "sgr17 _ samples .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ uno ] , the two boxes select the brightest region of the rgb , hence the radial profiles can be directly compared . in order to obtain an higher signal in the outer part of the profile",
    ", we also computed the radial profile for stars in the sgr global sample , the sgr global sample and _ sgr17 _ radial profiles are perfectly consistent each other , therefore the m  54 contamination should be negligible .",
    "such contamination of m  54 stars do not affect any of the results presented in the paper . ] .",
    "then we _ shifted _ the sgr radial profile in order to match the _",
    "one in the region @xmath11 ( upper panel in figure [ norm ] ) . the adopted sgr profile is thus computed using _ sgr17 _ for r@xmath12 ( i.e. @xmath13 ) and the sgr sample ( normalized to the former ) for r@xmath14 ( lower panel in figure [ norm ] ) .",
    "as expected , the global sgr sample is heavily incomplete in the innermost region .",
    "the effect of incompleteness is expected to be significantly lower in the _ sgr17 _",
    "sample , however , to be conservative , we consider the inner points ( r@xmath1516@xmath10 ) only as lower limits , hence they are plotted with different symbols in figure  [ norm ] .            in order to compute the radial surface brightness profile we followed two different approaches :    1 .",
    "the brightness of each annulus ( see above ) has been computed as the sum of the luminosity of all the stars lying in it normalized to the annulus area . however , as expected , the brightness profile turns out to be quite noisy since it is affected by large fluctuations due to the small number statistics of few bright giants .",
    "2 .   on the other hand ,",
    "since the observed number of stars in any post - ms evolutionary stage is a function of the sampled luminosity and the duration of the considered evolutionary phase ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the star density , n / area , can be easily converted into surface brightness by the relation : @xmath16 , where the value of @xmath17 depends on the considered evolutionary phase . since both the m  54 and _ sgr17 _ selection boxes sample approximately the same portion of rgb ( see figure  [ uno ] ) , the same value of the constant _  c \" _ can be applied to both profiles .",
    "we derived the value of c by fitting the m  54 radial profile with a king model having the structural parameters tabulated in @xcite and normalizing the central surface brightness to @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the radial surface - brightness profile from procedure ( ii ) turns out to be fully consistent but less noisy than the one obtained from procedure ( i ) .",
    "the derived radial surface brightness profiles for m  54 and sgr are plotted in figure [ pro1 ] ( empty triangles and circles , respectively ) together with the m  54 best fit king model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* upper continuous curve ) .",
    "note that the surface brightness in the outer part of the sgr profile ( r@xmath1910@xmath5 , @xmath20 ) , is fully consistent with previous determinations by @xcite .",
    "we also fitted the inner sgr profile ( hereafter nuclear structure , sgr - ns ) with a king model ( lower continuous curve ) having r@xmath21=12@xmath10.6 ( which should be considered as an upper limit ) and r@xmath22=16@xmath5.7 as core and tidal radii , respectively .",
    "this king model can be used to derive a lower limit to the sgr - ns integrated magnitude .",
    "it is also important to stress that a satisfactory fit to the sgr - ns profile can not be obtained using r@xmath23 as tidal radius .",
    "thus , as a first result , we conclude that _ the sgr - ns and m  54 do not share the same profile _ , the sgr - ns being a more extended structure .    .",
    "dashed lines mark the plateau level reached in the most external regions of the profiles.,width=317 ]    indeed , the presence of the sgr - ns and the sgr field may have corrupted the r@xmath23 value derived by @xcite .",
    "however , the m  54 radial profile presented in figure [ pro1 ] , confirms that r@xmath23=7@xmath5.5 is a reasonable value . in any case , even if r@xmath23 was actually overestimated , our conclusions remain unchanged : the sgr - ns and m54 scale lengths and , hence , their radial profiles are different .",
    "in figure [ plms ] we plotted the radial profiles obtained also for the bp ( filled triangles ) and ms ( open circles ) samples selected in figure [ uno ] .",
    "once again , we see two significantly peaked structures with respect to a constant value reached in the external part of the profiles .",
    "we recall here that the ms sample is composed by a mix of the m  54 and sgr stellar populations while the bp sample is essentially composed by young and possibly metal rich sgr stars ( see figure [ uno ] and section 2 above and ls00 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the ms profile , the star density excess drops to zero at about @xmath2413@xmath5 , thereby it can not be due only to m  54 stars .",
    "the bp profile , with its peaked shape , confirms the existence of a nuclear structure in sgr .",
    "the bp profile seems to hold a density excess out to @xmath2415@xmath5 , even if with a low signal which prevents from drawing any firm conclusion .",
    "the bp in comparison with the ms profile seems to show a steeper decline .",
    "this somewhat unexpected trend may be , at least partly , due to the more severe incompleteness effect suffered by the fainter sample , i.e. the ms sample , in the most central regions .    in figure [ pro ] the surface brightness profile for the sgr population obtained here",
    "is combined with the king model obtained by @xcite for the external part of the sgr galaxy .",
    "the position of the core radius of the main body of the system ( r@xmath25=224@xmath5 ) is also shown in the figure ( large filled circle ) .",
    "figures [ pro ] and [ plms ] clearly show the presence of a central cusp in the sgr dsph as first suggested by ls00 and more recently by @xcite . in particular ls00 ( their figure  19 , panel c ) found a density excess of sgr rgb stars which drops significantly between 3@xmath5 to @xmath2412@xmath5 from the center of m  54 in agreement with the sgr profile in figure [ pro ] .",
    "they also find ( figure 20 , panel a ) that stars in the blue plume ( their _  1 gyr \" _",
    "sample ) show a star density excess which drops to zero between 12@xmath5 and 19@xmath5 from the m  54 center , consistently with our bp profile .",
    "in the previous section we demonstrated the presence of a strongly peaked structure in the densest region of sgr . this structure ( sgr - ns ) is made by stars belonging to the typical metal rich stellar population of sgr ( see figure [ uno ] ) and hence it is distinct from m  54 .",
    "its center , at best of our resolution , coincides with that of m  54 ( as can be seen from figure [ duebis ] ) , while the sgr - ns profile is more extended than the cluster one ( see figure [ pro1 ] ) .",
    "the sgr radial profile shown in figure [ pro ] is extremely similar to that of a nucleated dwarf galaxy ( i.e. the combination of a large scale profile and a central cusp , see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "in order to test the compatibility of sgr - ns with a dwarf elliptical nucleus , we now put some limit on its integrated magnitude ( m@xmath26 ) . from the inspection of figure  [ pro1 ] ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume @xmath27 - 10.01 @xcite as an upper limit .",
    "although the sgr radial profile is certainly affected by severe incompleteness ( in the innermost region , see figure  [ pro ] ) , it can be used to set a lower limit to the integrated magnitude of the sgr central cusp , m@xmath26 .    by integrating the sgr king model adopted in figure  [ pro1 ] ( lower curve ) we obtained @xmath28 which corresponds to m@xmath26=-7.8 by assuming m@xmath29=4.83 and the appropriate bolometric correction ( see , e.g. , table 5 by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as in section  2",
    ", we performed a consistency check by using star counts .",
    "first we selected a region in which the incompleteness effects are expected to be negligible ( 2@xmath30r@xmath154@xmath5 from the cusp center ) . by using the sgr king model adopted in figure [ pro1 ] we estimate that the annulus contains @xmath2416% of the global cusp luminosity .",
    "then we use the number of hb stars observed in the considered annulus in order to calibrate the total luminosity . in the considered annulus we counted 56 hb stars . from this number",
    "we estimate a total hb population of n@xmath31=56/0.16=350 stars in the central cusp . as already mentioned , the number of stars observed in any given post - ms evolutionary stage is connected to the global luminosity and the duration of the phase by the equation : @xmath32 , where n@xmath33 and t@xmath33 are the number of stars and the duration of the j evolutionary stage and b(t ) is the specific evolutionary flux for the considered stellar population ( @xmath34 for an old stellar population ) . by assuming @xmath35  yr and",
    "n@xmath31=350 we easily obtain the global luminosity : @xmath36 which corresponds to m@xmath26=-7.6 under the same assumption about m@xmath29 and the bolometric correction .",
    "thus , the two estimates are in close agreement .",
    "however , we will consider a conservative global uncertainty of @xmath37  mag for our estimate .",
    "we can now compare the photometric properties of the sgr / sgr - ns system derived above with those observed in de , n . in figure [ bri ] the surface brightness of the envelope ( at half light ) is plotted _ vs _ the nucleus luminosity for a sample of de , n in the fornax cluster ( filled circles , * ? ? ?",
    "the permitted range of parameter space for sgr - ns is represented by the shaded area , where we assumed as surface brightness of the envelope the one at the core radius of the main body of sgr , i.e. @xmath38 . as can be seen , in this plane _ the sgr - ns behaves exactly as a nucleus_.        as quoted in sect .  1 . , the possibility that m  54 represent the nucleus of sgr was already discussed in the literature . however , as noted by @xcite , galactic nuclei usually have colors similar to that of the surrounding galaxy field @xcite , even if a few nuclei bluer than the field do exist @xcite . at odds with m  54 , sgr - ns has the same color of the surrounding sgr field .",
    "moreover the sgr - ns shows a central surface brightness ( @xmath3919 ) more than 6  mag brighter than the central brightness of the main body of sgr ( @xmath4025 ) . this is a pretty typical value for a de , n .",
    "conversely , if m  54 is considered as the sgr nucleus it would have a @xmath41 more than 10  mag brighter than the brightness of the sgr envelope .",
    "note that none of the 5 de , n analyzed by @xcite and only one of the 14 analyzed by @xcite show such a large difference .",
    "it is therefore safe to conclude that the structural characteristics of sgr - ns seem _ more typical of a de nucleus _ than those of m  54 .",
    "the discovery of the nuclear structure presented here clearly demonstrates that _ the sgr galaxy has its own nucleus_. now the most intriguing property of the sgr nucleus is the spatial coincidence with m  54 , which poses the main question : which is the relation between the sgr - ns and the cluster m  54 ?",
    "by selecting a sample of sgr giants in the extensive cmd presented by @xcite we have demonstrated the existence of a nuclear structure in the sgr galaxy .",
    "the radial profile of the rgb overdensity ( sgr - ns ) is well reproduced by a king model and it appears different from the profile of m54 .",
    "we considered the characteristics of sgr - ns ( color , integrated magnitude , central surface brightness ) with respect to the underlying sgr field and we find that sgr - ns behaves as a typical faint dwarf elliptical nucleus . while m  54 has been claimed to be the sgr nucleus , the photometric properties of sgr - ns are more typical of a dwarf elliptical nucleus than those of m  54 .",
    "it is important to remark that _ the sgr dsph would appear as a nucleated galaxy even if m54 would be removed from its center_.    nevertheless , the spatial coincidence of m  54 and sgr - ns is impressive and needs to be explained .",
    "we can envisage three possible frameworks that may be consistent with the observations .",
    "first an _ in situ _ origin can be imagined for both m54 and sgr - ns . in this scenario",
    "the first generation of ( metal - poor ) stars of sgr formed a bright and compact nucleus at the bottom of the potential well of the galaxy ( m54 ) .",
    "the remaining enriched gas formed subsequent generations of stars following the same density profile , driven by a similar potential .",
    "hence , the recycled ( and chemically enriched ) gas accumulated within and around m54 and subsequently formed the observed sgr - ns .",
    "the difference in the density profiles of the two systems seems to militate against this hypothesis .",
    "further interesting clues in this sense may be obtained comparing the _ velocity dispersion _ profiles of the two rgb samples within @xmath42 .",
    "second , the sgr - ns can be made by star captured by m  54 from the sgr field ( a possibility already suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "a reliable , quantitative exploration of this scenario would require properly designed dynamical simulations that are clearly beyond the scope of the present analysis .    finally , m54 may be an ordinary globular that has been brought to the central nucleus of sgr by the dynamical friction .",
    "this hypothesis would naturally explain the spatial coincidence of the cluster and sgr - ns and the difference in the density profiles of the two structures that , in this case , would have different and independent natures .",
    "the viability of this scenario can be verified with simple analytical arguments .",
    "the dynamical friction ( df ) process is the deceleration experienced by a massive object due to the interactions with particles in the surrounding field .",
    "it is an n - body problem which does not admit an exact analytical solution .",
    "however , @xcite studied the orbital evolution of a massive object immersed in an isothermal halo . by means of a few assumptions , they were able to derive a simple formula for the total time , t@xmath43 , required for a body to spiral from an initial radius r@xmath44 to the bottom of the halo potential well . in figure [ dyn ]",
    "we plotted t@xmath43 as a function of r@xmath44 for two objects of 10@xmath45 ( the m  54 mass ) , and 10@xmath46 ( roughly the mass of the other sgr s globular clusters , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we assumed as initial velocity ( relative to the surrounding field ) the sgr central velocity dispersion as measured by @xcite , @xmath47=11.4 km  s@xmath48 .",
    "we also assumed the sgr tidal radius as maximum impact parameter of the massive body with a halo particle .",
    "we recall here that , assuming a distance modulus ( m - m)@xmath49=17.10 @xcite , the core and tidal radii of the sgr main body ( r@xmath50=224@xmath5 , r@xmath51=1801@xmath5 ) measured by @xcite correspond , respectively , to 1.7  kpc and 13.8  kpc .    from the inspection of figure [ dyn ] ,",
    "it is evident that a massive cluster like m54 would have been seriously affected by df in an hubble time ( assumed to be 13  gyr ) for any initial distance shorter than 3r@xmath50=5.1  kpc from the galaxy center .",
    "conversely the other sgr globulars , due to their smaller masses , would have been affected by df only for initial distances lower than 1r@xmath50 , while their actual positions are outside r@xmath50 ( for instance , ter  7 lie at about 3  kpc from m  54 ) .",
    "hence , the spatial coincidence of ns and m54 can be easily explained if sgr - ns was formed _ in situ _ in the tip of the sgr potential well and m  54 has been driven to the galaxy center by dynamical friction .",
