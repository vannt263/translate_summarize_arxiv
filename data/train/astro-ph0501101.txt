    "the decade of the 1990s saw the development of gravitational microlensing as a new method to detect objects in the planet through stellar mass range through their gravitational effect on light rays from background stars @xcite .",
    "applications of this method include such diverse topics as the search for baryonic dark matter in the milky way halo @xcite , the discovery of planets orbiting distant stars @xcite , limb darkening measurements of distant stars @xcite , and obtaining high s / n spectra of distant stars that would otherwise be possible only with future extremely large telescopes @xcite .",
    "the original proposal for this method was the suggestion by @xcite to use microlensing to determine if the milky way s dark halo is made up of brown dwarfs or jupiters .",
    "( dark matter objects that can be detected via microlensing are often referred to as massive compact halo object or machos . )",
    "the macho and eros groups have completed the microlensing survey proposed by @xcite , and their main result is the conclusion that the milky way s dark halo is _ not _ dominated by objects with masses in the planet - stellar mass range @xcite .",
    "objects in the entire mass range , @xmath0 are excluded from dominating the milky way s dark halo , with upper limits extending down to @xmath1% of the dark halo mass for sub - stellar mass objects .",
    "however , the macho project @xcite has found a microlensing signal above the expected background due to lensing by known stellar populations in the milky way and large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "this signal has a microlensing optical depth equivalent to a dark halo with a macho fraction of about 20% , although the total mass could be somewhat smaller with if the machos have a distribution that resembles a spheroid or a very thick disk rather than the dark halo @xcite .",
    "some of the first results from m31 microlensing observations appears to confirm this result @xcite .",
    "the timescale of the lmc microlensing events indicates a typical mass of @xmath2 , so the most plausible lens objects are white dwarfs , because main sequence stars of this mass would be much too bright to have previously escaped detection .",
    "however , there are a number of potential problems with the white dwarf explanation of this lmc microlensing excess @xcite . on the other hand , many of the constraints are evaded if most of the halo white dwarfs have helium atmospheres",
    ". it might also be possible to explain the macho results with a population dominated by lower mass objects @xcite .",
    "the leading alternative explanation for the lmc microlensing excess is that the lens objects are ordinary stars associated with the lmc @xcite .",
    "however , standard models of the lmc predict that macho should have detected only 2 - 4 events from known stellar populations @xcite , and there is a simple dynamical explanation for the small lmc self - lensing optical depth @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the lmc is not an isolated galaxy and may have had significant dynamical disturbances from the milky way @xcite , but current lmc models that include these effects still can not account for the observed microlensing events @xcite because most of the events do not occur in the regions of the highest predicted lmc self - lensing rate .",
    "the other logical possibility is that the background of microlensing events due to faint stars in the local galactic disk could have been underestimated , but the lens stars for such events should be readily observed in both high resolution and ir observations as event macho - lmc-5 has demonstrated @xcite in fact , most candidate milky way disk events are readily identifiable through their anomalous unmagnified colors in the macho data , and of the other published microlensing candidates , only macho - lmc-20 appears consistent with lensing by a low mass disk star .",
    "thus , this possibility appears to be less likely than halo or lmc lenses .",
    "of course , all of this assumes that the macho lmc microlensing results are correct .",
    "the eros collaboration has also monitored the lmc for microlensing events , but have detected fewer events than macho and reported an upper limit on the microlensing optical depth that is only barely consistent with the macho detection @xcite .",
    "a similar near - discrepancy holds for microlensing towards the galactic bulge , where macho also measured a higher microlensing optical depth @xcite than eros @xcite in this case , the macho result is clearly favored as it is more consistent with separate measurements by ogle @xcite and moa @xcite , as well as a completely independent measurement by macho @xcite .",
    "the difficulty with interpreting the lmc results combined with the near - discrepancy between the macho and eros results , has led @xcite ( hereafter bel ) to attempt to develop an independent microlensing event selection method for the macho data set . in an attempt to improve upon the macho event selection method , bel",
    "have introduced a method using neural networks instead of the series of simple cuts on statistics used by macho .",
    "this method seemed promising because neural networks should be able to find a set of event selection cuts that are more efficient at identifying microlensing events than can be easily obtained by more traditional trial - and - error methods .",
    "however , a major drawback of neural networks is their  black box \" nature : it is not obvious exactly why the neural network might make its event classification decisions .",
    "thus , a neural network could mysteriously fail to identify real microlensing events if there was some subtle difference between the real data and the example events used in the training set for the neural network , and it would be difficult to find such an error .",
    "this is the reason that neural networks were not used in the macho analysis , and it appears to have led bel and @xcite to over  interpret their results .",
    "in fact , the specific neural network implementation of bel has a number of serious flaws .",
    "ideally , one would simply feed the raw time series photometry and error estimates into the neural network , and let the neural network sort out how to find microlensing events . with hundreds or thousands of input values , such a neural network would be far too slow to be practical .",
    "a practical neural network implementation can be obtained if we reduce the raw light curve data to a much smaller number of statistics that can be calculated from the raw data .",
    "the choice of these statistics is , of course , critical to the success of the neural network classification method , and this is where the method of bel appears to fail . bel select a set of statistics that are based upon auto- and cross - correlation functions of the light curve data , with the time series treated as if they were sampled uniformly in time ( which they certainly are not ) .",
    "the bel statistics appear to ignore the measurement errors and to ignore much of the time history information , so it would be somewhat surprising if it could do as well as the macho selection method .",
    "finally , @xcite have identified a serious logical flaw in the argument of @xcite who claim that the lmc microlensing optical depth must be lower than the macho value .",
    "the bel analysis can not seriously be considered as a method to select microlensing events from a complete data set of millions of light curves , because its false alarm rate is 1 in @xmath3 , which is much higher than the microlensing rate for any plausible galactic model .",
    "thus , bel use their method in the only way that they can , they apply it to events that have already passed the macho selection criteria .",
    "thus , there is no chance that they could detect events that macho missed , so their detection efficiency is necessarily lower , contrary to the claim of @xcite .",
    "as we shall see in this paper , the bel method fails to confirm 3 events that are almost certainly microlensing events , while  confirming \" one microlensing candidate that is almost certainly a variable star .",
    "thus , it seems clear that the current version of the bel analysis does not help to identify actual microlensing events .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ data_phot ] describes the data sets used for our analysis and the photometry codes used to convert the images into photometric measurements .",
    "[ lc_fit ] describes our method for light curve fitting and comparison with hst photometry of the candidate microlensed source stars .",
    "the detailed modeling of the 4 individual events presented in this paper are presented in sub - sections [ event - lmc4][event - lmc23 ]",
    ". a detailed comparison of the results of bel s analysis with our results and other additional data is presented in sec .",
    "[ confront ] , and in sec .",
    "[ conclude ] , we discuss the implications of our results for the interpretation of the microlensing results towards the lmc .",
    "the events presented in this paper were all identified as microlensing candidates in @xcite , based upon photometry with the standard macho sodophot photometry routine .",
    "the sodophot photometry presented in this paper is essentially identical to that presented in @xcite .",
    "a subset of the macho images for these events were also reduced with the difimphot difference imaging photometry package @xcite . in very crowded star fields ,",
    "the difference imaging method is usually more accurate than the profile fitting method employed by sodophot @xcite . also , the sodophot and difimphot photometry codes are likely to produce different systematic errors , so a comparison of sodophot and difimphot photometry of the same images can reveal data points that might have be affected by these systematic errors .",
    "event macho - lmc-4 was the first lmc microlensing event discovered and announced in progress , and this occurred on 1994 , oct .",
    "it was discovered while staffing arrangements for macho / gman service observing on the ctio 0.9 m telescope were still being finalized , and as a consequence , it was not possible to take ctio data through the peak of the event .",
    "because of this problem with the ctio data , extra observations were scheduled with the macho survey telescope ( the 1.3 m  great melbourne \" telescope at mt .",
    "stromlo ) until observations from ctio could resume .",
    "the ctio data set for this consists of a single observation before the light curve peak , taken shortly after the event was discovered , and 155 observations taken after the light curve peak , including 10 baseline observations taken more than a year after the peak .",
    "these ctio data were reduced with the allframe package @xcite , and 0.5% was added in quadrature to the allframe error estimates to account for low level systematic errors such as flatfielding errors .",
    "( for the macho sodophot photometry , 1.4% is added in quadrature to the sodophot output errors as described in @xcite . )",
    "134 of these 156 measurements pass our data quality cuts @xcite and are included in this analysis .",
    "this is in addition to 730 macho - red band and 728 macho - blue band photometric measurements from sodophot which pass our data quality cuts , as well as 85 macho - red band and 78 macho - blue band images reduced with difimphot .",
    "the images reduced with difimphot were chosen to cover the region of the microlensing magnification as well as a bit of the baseline .",
    "microlensing event macho - lmc-13 was detected and announced on 1996 , feb .",
    "11 , near peak magnification as macho 96-lmc-1 .",
    "additional observations were immediately requested from the ctio 0.9 m , and 376 ctio r - band images were eventually obtained including 145 baseline measurements taken more than 180 days after the light curve peak .",
    "332 of these ctio measurements pass our data quality cuts .",
    "the data from the macho survey includes 1074 macho - red measurements and 1176 macho - blue measurements reduced with sodophot as well as 84 measurements covering the magnified part of the light curve in each macho band reduced with difimphot .",
    "in addition , there were 47 r - band and 64 v - band measurements from the utso 0.6 m telescope .",
    "these are included in our fits , but they have only limited time coverage and have larger error bars than the ctio measurements , and so they are not included in our figure .",
    "these data were reduced in the same way as the ctio and lmc-4 data .",
    "the final event in our sample is macho - lmc-15 which was detected and announced on 1997 , jan .",
    "15 as macho 97-lmc-1 , well before peak magnification .",
    "additional observations were again immediately requested from the ctio 0.9 m , and 74 ctio r - band images were obtained , including 26 baseline measurements taken more than 180 days after the light curve peak .",
    "60 of these ctio observations pass our data quality cuts .",
    "the macho survey data set consists of 475 macho - red and 586 macho - blue sodophot measurements as well as 47 macho - red and 49 macho - blue difimphot measurements .",
    "the difimphot data covers the magnified portion of the light curve along with the baseline immediately before and after the event .",
    "important constraints on our analysis of the light curve data come from the high resolution hst wfpc2 images of the microlensed source stars after the microlensing events were over .",
    "the reduction of the hst data and the identification of the microlensed source stars are discussed in @xcite .",
    "unlike many types of stellar variability , it is possible to calculate theoretical microlensing light curves with an accuracy that is much better than observational errors , and this makes light curve fitting an extremely powerful method for testing the hypothesis that a candidate microlensing event was indeed caused by microlensing .",
    "the light curve fitting method is extremely effective in discriminating against the largest background to microlensing events in the lmc , supernovae of type ia , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "this success is due to the fact that there exist accurate models for type ia supernova light curves .",
    "the situation is different for supernovae of type ii , which do not have an accurate light curve model .",
    "the macho project @xcite was also able to exclude its type ii sne background by doing fits to sn type 1a light curve models , but this method was only convincing because these same events also had detectable galaxy hosts visible in the macho images or in other ground based images with slightly higher resolution .",
    "( since type ii sne occur with young host stars and are usually fainter than type ia sne , they generally have much brighter host galaxies . )    after the removal of the supernovae , the confirmation of microlens candidates becomes a bit more difficult because little is known about the extremely rare types of variable stars that might mimic microlensing events .",
    "thus , we are limited to testing the microlensing model rather than comparing it against another model .",
    "this task is complicated by the fact that the photometric errors are mildly non - gaussian , although the macho and gman data have managed to remove most of the photometry outliers with cuts on a number of data quality flags .",
    "one model parameter that is particularly sensitive to systematic photometry errors is the baseline brightness of the source star . in the crowded fields observed by microlensing surveys , it is quite common for the source star to be blended with other stars within the same seeing disk .",
    "thus , the source star brightness is usually used as a fit parameter , but there is a near degeneracy in light curve shapes that can make this parameter difficult to determine from a fit .",
    "another complication is the fact that @xmath4% of microlensing events are ",
    "exotic \" events that do nt follow the standard paczyski  light curve . in some cases , such as caustic crossing binary lens events , the ",
    "exotic \" features are so unique to lensing that there can be no ambiguity in the interpretation of the event , such as a caustic crossing binary lens event like macho - lmc-9 @xcite . however , in other cases , such as macho - lmc-22 @xcite , non  microlensing variability can be fit with an exotic lens model .    in view of these considerations , we adopt the following series of steps in order to test the microlensing hypothesis for candidate microlensing events towards the lmc :    1 .",
    "we fit each event with a light curve constraining the macho - blue source star brightness to match the v magnitude from the hst observations .",
    "( the tranformation from macho - blue to the standard cousins v - band is only weakly dependent on the macho - red magnitude @xcite . )",
    "the best unconstrained fit should not have a fit @xmath5 that is significantly lower than the constrained fit  unless the source star itself is blended with the lens star .",
    "2 .   the @xmath6 values for the fit should be consistent with expectations for real microlensing event . of particular interest",
    "are the @xmath6 values for the follow - up ctio and difimphot data points , and the @xmath6 values in the light curve peak region ( defined as the region where the best fit magnification is @xmath7 ) .",
    "comparison of the different photometry data sets can indicate if an apparent deviation may be due to systematic photometry errors .",
    "if a standard paczyski  model is not a good fit to the data , is there an exotic model that gives a good fit with plausible parameters ?",
    "if so , are the number of candidates that must be fit with exotic models consistent with expectations ? 4 .",
    "the fit macho - red baseline magnitude for the source star is converted to the standard cousins r - band and compared to the hst r - band magnitude of the source star .",
    "if it does nt match , is it consistent with a blending model ?    when making a goodness of fit judgement , it is important to keep in mind that the photometry errors are non - gaussian , so gaussian probabilities do not apply . fig .",
    "[ fig - chi2 ] shows the distribution of fit @xmath6 values for a set of monte carlo events from the lmc efficiency analysis @xcite ( black outline histogram ) as well as the observed distribution for galactic bulge microlensing events found by the macho alert system @xcite ( red histogram ) .",
    "events that have been classified as ",
    "exotic \" microlensing events can be expected to have a poor fit to a standard paczyski  light curve , and these are indicated by the red outline histogram .",
    "note that all the events with @xmath8 have been displayed in the @xmath9 bin .",
    "the light curves for the events displayed in these histogram typically have 5002000 total data points ( including both macho - red and macho - blue observations ) , so the width of the @xmath6 distribution is somewhat larger than we d expect from gaussian statistics .",
    "while there is considerable overlap between the monte carlo and actual galactic bulge microlensing event fit @xmath6 distributions , the real data distribution extends to larger values because some types of systematic photometry errors are not captured by the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the fit @xmath6 values for the events presented in this paper are listed in table  [ tbl - fitpar ] and the fit @xmath6 values for the events we present in this paper , lmc-4 , 13 , and 15 , are in the 82nd , 64th , and 42nd percentiles , respectively , of the observed @xmath6 distribution for non - exotic galactic bulge events ( the solid red histogram in fig .",
    "[ fig - chi2 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the dubious microlens candidate , lmc-23 , is in the 91st percentile ( see sec .  [ sec - lmc23 ] .",
    "this alone is not enough to disqualify this event as microlensing , particularly because a microlensing parallax model gives a significantly better @xmath6 .    before proceeding to discuss the individual events",
    ", we should note that all the fits presented here are joint fits to the ctio data as well as both the sodophot and difimphot reductions of the macho data .",
    "this is necessary because only the sodophot reductions have been calibrated to the cousins system and because the difimphot photometry of the unmagnified portions of the light curves are limited .",
    "this means that the macho images that have yielded photometry by both methods are used twice , and we must be careful that this double counting does not affect our results . in order to correct for the effects of this double counting ,",
    "we have adjusted the error bars in table  [ tbl - fitpar ] to coincide with the fractional errors obtained by fitting only the sodophot+ctio data or the difimphot+ctio data ( whichever has smaller error estimates ) .",
    "also , the total @xmath10 values presented in table  [ tbl - delchi2 ] are the sum of the individual @xmath10 values for the ctio data plus the larger of the sodophot or the difimphot @xmath10 values .",
    "the full macho lmc-4 light curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - lmc4long ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - lmc4 ] shows a light curve close - up .",
    "the black curve in each plot is the best fit standard paczyski  light curve , while the fit parameters and @xmath5 values are given in tables [ tbl - fitpar ] and [ tbl - chi2 ] . the fit @xmath5 decreases by only @xmath11 with one additional degree of freedom , if the hst constraint on the baseline brightness in the macho - blue band is released . the data in fig .

    "have been combined into 8-day bins and the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - lmc4 ] are displayed in 2-day bins in order to show how well the data fits the model light curve .",
    "since there are as many as 5 observations per day for this event , a display without binning is easily dominated by the measurements with large error bars , and the strength of the signal is easily obscured ( as shown in @xcite ) .",
    "the difimphot photometry provides error bars that are @xmath12% of the sodophot error bars , and the fit @xmath6 values are similar .",
    "the ctio photometry has error bars that average @xmath13% of the sodophot error bars with @xmath14 , so the difimphot and ctio photometry clearly support the microlensing model .",
    "table [ tbl - delchi2 ] shows @xmath10 , which is the improvement in the fit @xmath5 over a constant brightness model . as we should expect from the size of the error bars , the @xmath10 values are about a factor of two larger for the difimphot data than with the original sodophot data .",
    "the @xmath10 contribution from the ctio data is smaller , despite the smaller error bars , because of limited coverage of the ctio observations .",
    "the one apparent discrepancy between the model and the data is the macho - blue point at the peak of the light curve , a bin which is the average of the 6 observations from the night of 1994 , oct .",
    "20 , and 2 observations from oct .  21 , when most of the night was clouded out .",
    "this high point is caused by 3 of these 8 unbinned measurements , which are between 2-@xmath15 and 3-@xmath15 above the best fit curve with the sodophot photometry .",
    "4 of the remaining measurements from these two days are within @xmath16 of the best fit curve , and the remaining point is about 1.8-@xmath15 below the best fit curve .",
    "the 3 high points are immediately preceded and followed by other observations on the same day that are within 1-@xmath15 of or below the best fit light curve . for the difimphot photometry , the 3 high points are between 1.5-@xmath15 and 2.2-@xmath15 above the best fit curve , but the point below the curve has moved much closer to the fit curve .",
    "so , although the difimphot photometry reduces the scatter , the average of the 8 data points is @xmath17-@xmath15 above the curve for both the sodophot and difimphot photometry .",
    "all evidence suggests that these high photometry points are due to a systematic photometry errors instead of some intrinsic change in blue - band brightness variation .",
    "the high points are not correlated in time , and they are not reproduced in the macho - red band despite the fact that the two macho passbands have some overlap in wavelength .",
    "this strongly suggests that this high point is due to a systematic photometry error , and observers report suggests a possible cause of such an error . the report from oct .",
    "20 began with the following description of the observing conditions : ` observing conditions fairly poor for most of the night , drifting cloud patches and a bright moon .",
    "seeing poor , 2.7``3.5 '' . ' these bright moon conditions did not affect any other part of the magnified part of the light curve , so we conclude that a systematic photometry error related to the bright sky background is the most likely cause of the macho - blue deviation at the peak of the light curve .",
    "the source star lies on the main sequence in the hst color - magnitude diagram @xcite , and its fit r - magnitude is within 1@xmath15 of the hst r - magnitude , so the microlensing model correctly predicts the source star color .",
    "( the uncertainty in the fit @xmath18 magnitude is the quadrature sum of the fit error ( 0.04 mag in this case ) , the 0.04 mag calibration uncertainty @xcite , and the uncertainty in the hst v - magnitude that the fit is normalized to ( 0.03 mag ) .",

    "stromlo data , the much better light curve coverage means that most of strength of the microlensing signal comes from the mt . stromlo data .",
    "the addition of the ctio data and the difimphot photometry strengthens the microlensing signal considerably , from @xmath19 ( from the sodophot photometry alone ) to @xmath20 ( from the difimphot photometry and ctio data ) , with no indication of a deviation from the paczyski  light curve ( aside from the apparent systmatic error at the light curve peak ) . the @xmath10 value for lmc-4 with the ctio and difimphot photometry ranks it second among on the macho lmc microlensing event candidates , behind lmc-14 @xcite and in an approximate tie with lmc-1 .",
    "[ fig - lmc13long ] and [ fig - lmc13 ] show the full light curve and a close - up of the lmc-13 light curve , which is displayed in 8 and 4-day bins , respectively .",
    "this event shows the greatest improvement with the difimphot photometry , with difimphot error bars that are , on average , @xmath21% of the sodophot error bars . also , in this case , ctio observations were able to begin shortly after the alert",
    ", just prior to peak magnificaiton , and the ctio data show that the light curve follows the microlensing model very accurately from peak magnification down to to the baseline .",
    "[ fig - lmc13 ] also reveals some apparent photometric errors in the sodophot macho - blue light curve .",
    "apparent deviations above the fit curve at the peak and near day 1575 disappear in the difimphot data set as does a low point with small error bars near day 1485 .",
    "these systematic errors also appear to interfere with the blending estimate from the light curve fit .",
    "an unconstrained fit predicts a source star v magnitude that misses the hst value by about 3.4 times the 1@xmath15 uncertainty , and the fit with the source star magnitude constrained to the hst magnitude increases the @xmath5 value of the fit by 7.08 which corresponds to a 2.7@xmath15 discrepancy .",
    "however , most of this @xmath5 is from the macho - blue sodophot photometry while the macho - blue difimphot photometry has an improved @xmath5 with the hst normalized fit .",
    "thus , we believe that the hst normalized fit is probably more accurate .    from table  [ tbl - fitpar ] , we can see that our fit matches the hst r - magnitude exactly , and the source star is on the main sequence of the hst color - magnitude diagram @xcite . while the difimphot photometry reduces the photometry error bars by a factor of 2/3",
    ", the ctio follow - up photometry has error bars that are , on average a factor of 5 smaller than the original sodophot photometry of the macho data .",
    "the fact that the paczyski  light curve shape is confirmed with photometry 5 times more accurate than the macho sodophot photometry that the event identification was based on provides strong support for the microlensing interpretation of this event .",

    "this event was the lowest signal  to  noise event to pass the stricter ",
    "criterion a \" of the macho lmc 5.7 year analysis .",
    "fortunately , the event was identified well before peak magnification , and very good light curve coverage was obtained from ctio that filled the gaps in the data from mt .",
    "furthermore , the error bars on the ctio measurements are , on average , a factor of 4 smaller than the macho - red error bars and a factor of 4.8 smaller than the macho - blue error bars , while the ctio @xmath6 is quite reasonable .",
    "so , the ctio data provides strong confirmation of the microlensing hypothesis .",
    "the difimphot photometry , on the other hand , provides only a modest improvement over sodophot with error bars that are @xmath22% of the sodophot error bars in the macho - red band and @xmath23% of the sodophot error bars in the macho - blue band .",
    "the fit parameters presented table  [ tbl - fitpar ] indicate that the fit r - band magnitude matches the hst value to better than @xmath24 , and the source star is also on the hst main sequence @xcite .",
    "also , the constraint that the macho - blue magnitude be fixed to match the hst v - band magnitude only causes @xmath5 to increase by @xmath25 , so the fit v - band magnitude also matches the hst v - band magnitude to better than 1@xmath15 .",
    "microlensing event candidate macho lmc-23 was not detected by the macho alert system , so there is no ctio data for it .",
    "some difimphot photometry does exist , with error bars that average @xmath26% of the sodophot error bars .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig - lmc23 ] that there are deviations from the standard paczyski  light curve fit .",
    "both the macho - red and blue data are brighter than the standard paczyski  light curve fit near days 1123 and 1163 , and this occurs for both the sodophot and difimphot photometry .",
    "all 4 data sets appear to be below the fit curve near day 1180 , as well .",
    "a microlensing parallax model ( the dashed green line ) provides a much better fit , and seems to fit the deviations at days 1163 and 1180 .",
    "there still appears to be a deviation near day 1123 , however .",
    "these qualitative observations are also reflected in the fit @xmath5 values shown in table  [ tbl - chi2 ] .",
    "for the standard paczyski  light curve fit , the peak @xmath6 values are quite large ranging from 3.229 for the macho - blue sodophot data to 5.814 for the blue difimphot data . for the microlensing parallax model fit ( labeled _",
    "lmc-23-p _ ) , the @xmath6 values drop to reasonable values for the sodophot photometry ( except perhaps the peak @xmath6 value for the macho - red data ) , but the difimphot values remain high at 2.434 and 3.012 , respectively , for macho - red and blue .",
    "this suggests that neither model is likely to be correct , but it is possible that a binary lens model might do better .",
    "another problem is that the fit r - band magnitudes do not match the hst r - band magnitude .",
    "they are off by @xmath27 , which is more than 4@xmath15 for both the standard and parallax fit .",
    "the source star is on the sub - giant branch of the hst color magnitude diagram @xcite , but the color at maximum brightness is more consistent with a main sequence star . on the other hand , the apparent redness of the source star could possibly be explained by blending in the hst images if the lens star were visible and redder than the source , as was the case for event 5 @xcite",
    ".    however , an additional complication is the fact that the eros collaboration has observed a subsequent brightening of this star approximately 2500 days after the one observed by macho @xcite .",
    "multiple brightening episodes can occur in binary lens or binary source microlensing events , such as macho 96-blg-4 @xcite , if the binary lens or source separation is large . however , the probability of detecting such an event decreases in proportion to the binary separation because alignment of both members of the binary with the single lens or source decreases with their separation .",
    "thus , while it might be possible to find a model that could explain this event as lensing , it would require several highly improbable occurrences for this single event : two different types of exotic lensing to explain the light curve shape in the macho data as well as the brightening seen by eros , plus a bright lens ( or unlikely hst blend by chance superposition ) .",
    "it is much more likely that macho lmc-23 is a variable star .",
    "this is currently the only macho lmc microlens candidate that we have any reason to suspect is not an actual microlensing event .",
    "the classification of the macho lmc events by the macho team and bel are listed in table  [ tab - class ] .",
    "this table also provides a  confirmation \" column which indicates the implication of additional data for the event classification .",
    "items that support the microlensing interpretation are listed in bold face , and items that tend to contradict the microlensing interpretation are presented in italics .",
    "the macho verdict refers to the classification given in a00 .",
    "events listed as @xmath28lens - a and @xmath28lens - b are candidate microlensing events that passed the strict criteria a , or only the looser b criterion .",
    "event 22 did pass criteria b , but a spectrum taken with the mssso 2.3 m telescope revealed that the source was an emission line galaxy at @xmath29 ( t.  axelrod , private communication ) .",
    "table  [ tab - class ] indicates that our expectation that the bel event selection method is unreliable has been borne out by our new data and analysis . of the 4 events that we have analyzed , the only one that bel",
    "classify as microlensing is event 23 , which is most likely a variable star .",
    "the other 3 events they classify as non  microlensing , but the new data confirms the microlensing interpretation , again contradicting bel .",
    "these 4 events probably provide the best test of the bel method , because these data had not been previously published , except in a phd thesis @xcite , and so , the additional data were probably not seen by bel when they were designing their method .",
    "in contrast , the original macho analysis @xcite is confirmed for the three events with additional photometric data during the microlensing event , but not for event 23 .",
    "the complete macho analysis identifies 25 events as either microlensing candidates or supernovae .",
    "( the events are numbered 1 , 427 , as events 2 and 3 from the first year analysis @xcite do not make the 5year cuts . ) of these 25 events , macho classifies 16 as microlensing candidates , 8 as background supernovae , and 1 as either an agn or a peculiar background supernova .",
    "the bel analysis identifies 10 of these events as microlensing , 5 as supernovae , and 9 as neither .",
    "event 9 , the lmc binary lens event @xcite , is not considered by bel .",
    "the bel analysis agrees with macho in the classification of 7 events as microlensing and 4 events as supernovae .",
    "we will now examine these classifications in light of other , non  light curve data .    of the 7 events identified by both macho and bel as microlensing ,",
    "event 1 has a follow - up spectrum consistent with the microlensing interpretation @xcite , and event 5 has been confirmed by hst observations that identified the lens star in the milky way disk and provided the first complete solution for a microlensing event @xcite .",
    "event 14 was confirmed with high signal - to - noise gman follow - up data which also enabled measurement of the microlensing  xallarap \" effect ( light curve oscillations due to the orbit of a binary source star ) and the determination that the lens is close to the lmc @xcite .",
    "we argue in sec .",
    "[ conclude ] that events 1 and 25 are very likely to be microlensing , as well , but we have seen that event 23 is probably a variable star although it was identified as a microlensing candidate by both macho @xcite and bel . thus , 4 of these 7 events can be considered to be confirmed , and 1 is rejected .",
    "three events are identified by bel , but not macho , as microlensing : events 10 , 22 , and 24 .",
    "they all have highly asymmetric light curves that suggest a non - microlensing origin , although in the case of event 22 , the asymmetry can be fit by a microlensing parallax model with plausible parameters .",
    "the macho photometry of event 10 is a near perfect fit to a supernova type ia light curve , and so this event is clearly a background supernova .",
    "it is near the blue end of the sn type 1a color distribution , and this is probably why bel s sn test fails .",
    "event 24 is also fit much better by a supernova type ia light curve than by standard microlensing , so it was also rejected as a microlensing candidate .",
    "the quality of the type ia fit for event 24 is poor , however , so it is more likely that this event is a type ii supernova .",
    "the source locations for each of these events correspond to background galaxies . for event 24 ,",
    "the galaxy is visible in the macho images , while the source  star \" for event 10 is revealed to be a compact galaxy in hst images @xcite .",
    "the source for lmc-22 appears slightly extended in a higher resolution ctio 4 m frame , and a spectrum of the source indicates that it is probably an active galaxy .",
    "thus , the microlensing interpretation is rejected for all three of these events classified by bel , but not macho , as microlensing .    of the 9 events classified by bel as neither microlensing nor supernovae , macho classifies 2 as supernovae , and 7 as microlensing ( events 4 , 7 , 8 , 13 , 15 , and 18 ) . in secs .",
    "[ event - lmc4][event - lmc15 ] , we have shown that the microlensing interpretations of 3 of these events ( 4 , 13 , and 15 ) are strongly confirmed by the additional photometry we have presented , but there exists no follow - up data that sheds light on the other events .",
    "however , event 8 is the lone event in the center of the lmc bar , where the lmc self - lensing probability is highest @xcite , so it seems likely that this event is microlensing , as well .",
    "thus , the bel classification fails for 3 of these events and is likely to fail for one other .",
    "it seems clear that the only category in which bel s event classification scheme appears to succeed , more often than not , is when it agrees with the macho classification .",
    "we have shown that their identification of events as  non - microlensing \" fails for the 3 events with new data presented in this paper , and in most cases where they disagree with macho , additional data strongly suggests that bel is wrong .",
    "we can only conclude that bel s selection method does not provide any help in separating real microlensing events from other types of variability that mimic microlensing .",
    "however , this does not mean that neural networks can not improve upon the macho analysis . instead , as we have argued in sec .",
    "[ nnet ] , that bel s method fails because of the weak set of statistics that they have relied upon .",
    "a neural network that uses the more powerful light curve fitting based statistics used by macho might indeed offer an improvement .",
    "the macho project s 5.7 year lmc analysis has identified a set of 16 candidate lmc microlensing events after removing the background supernovae . in this paper , we have analyzed additional photometry from gman follow - up observations with the ctio 0.9 m telescope as well as difimphot photometry of the original mt .",
    "stromlo macho observations for three of these events : macho lmc-4 , 13 and 15 .",
    "this additional photometry has errors that are smaller than the original macho photometry by a factor of 1.1 - 1.5 ( for difimphot ) and of 2.4 - 5 ( for the gman ctio photometry ) , and improves the light curve time coverage for these events .",
    "all three light curves with the improved photometry are well fit by a standard paczyski microlensing model .    for two of the three light curves ,",
    "the fit accurately predicts both the v and r  band magnitudes from high resolution hst observations of the microlensed source star . for the other event , lmc-13",
    ", the unconstrained paczyski  fit predicts a v  band magnitude that differs by the hst magnitude by 2.7@xmath15 , but the difference between the difimphot and sodophot photometry of the mt .",
    "stromlo data suggests that this may be affected by low level systematic photometry errors . a paczyski  light curve fit constrained to the hst",
    "v magnitude accurately predicts the hst r magnitude for event lmc-13 .",
    "thus , it is fair to say that the additional photometry provides a strong confirmation of the microlensing interpretation of these three events .",
    "in addition to these events , there are several other of the macho lmc microlensing candidates for which the microlensing interpretation seems very secure .",
    "event 14 has also been confirmed with gman photometry that provides evidence of the  xallarap \" effect @xcite , and event 5 is the first microlensing event in which the lens has been detected @xcite and has been completely solved yielding the mass , transverse velocity and distance of the lens @xcite .",
    "the consistency of the microlensing mass determination with the lens star brightness and colors provides a strong confirmation of the microlensing model for this event .",
    "events lmc-1 and lmc-25 are the two events which clearly have red clump giant source stars @xcite , and such stars have not exhibited the type of variability that could be confused with microlensing @xcite as observed in eros lmc-1 and 2 and macho lmc-2 and 23 @xcite . finally , event macho lmc-9 is well fit by a binary lens model @xcite and has a light curve shape that is different from other known forms of variability with the very rapid brightness variation that is characteristic of a binary lens caustic crossing .",
    "so , out of the 16 macho lmc microlensing candidates , 5 have been confirmed with additional data , and another 3 appear very likely to be microlensing . of the 5 events that have been confirmed with additional data ,",
    "4 have been selected by a completely independent method  their discovery by the macho alert system .",
    "all 4 of these events have been confirmed to be microlensing , which suggests that most of the macho lmc microlensing candidates are indeed due to microlensing .",
    "nevertheless , the example of macho lmc-23 suggests that some caution is warranted regarding the interpretation of 7 remaining macho lmc microlensing events that have not yet been confirmed .",
    "it is instructive to consider the results of @xcite who have done detailed predictions of the properties of lmc self - lensing events based upon some of the latest models of the lmc .",
    "( their classifications are listed in table  [ tab - class ] . )",
    "they identify 4 of the macho events that are good lmc self - lensing candidates : events 6 , 8 , 13 , and 14 . a straight  forward extension of their analysis also adds the binary lens event , 9 , to this list .",
    "this identification is strengthened by independent light curve analyses that suggest that events 9 and 14 both have lenses residing in the lmc @xcite . of the remaining 10 events",
    ", the event 5 lens star has been shown to be a disk star .",
    "it is most likely a member of the thick disk , but thin disk membership can not be ruled out @xcite .",
    "event 20 is also a disk lens candidate because it appears to be blended with a star that is much redder than other lmc stars of similar magnitude @xcite .",
    "( if event 20 is also a disk lens this would give us a total of 2 disk events when a total of 0.75 are expected from the combined thin and thick disks .",
    "the poisson probability to detect 2 or more disk events when 0.75 are expected is 17% . )",
    "this leaves 8 events as halo lens candidates : events 1 , 4 , 7 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 25 and 27 .",
    "two of these halo lens candidates ( 4 and 15 ) are confirmed by the photometry and light curve fitting presented here , and two others ( 1 and 25 ) are considered  solid \" events because of their red clump giant source stars .",
    "thus , there is little difference between the quality of the different categories of events .",
    "thus , the  confirmed \" events appear to be distributed about evenly among the disk , halo , and lmc  self lensing candidate events .",
    "our qualitative conclusion is that the puzzle of the excess lmc lensing events remains unresolved .",
    "our knowledge of the galactic disk and lmc suggest that most of the lenses must reside in a previously undiscovered population , and the milky way halo is the natural location for this , since the halo s mass is largely unaccounted for .",
    "but such a population presents a number of problems if it is composed of known objects like white dwarfs .",
    "the leading alternative explanation is that lmc self - lensing dominates , but this possibility gets no significant observational support from detailed lmc models or from the properties of the microlensing events themselves .",
    "( see @xcite for a different point of view . )",
    "a resolution of this puzzle will probably require additional data so that the distance to a representative sample of lmc lensing events can be determined .",
    "this could come from the microlensing key project for the sim mission @xcite , or from a deep impact mission extension ( dime ) @xcite , which would use the 30 cm telescope on the deep impact spacecraft to make microlensing parallax observations from a heliocentric orbit @xcite , if it is approved .",
    "microlensing experiments towards other lines of site could also shed some light on this issue @xcite .",
    "in addition , the supermacho @xcite and moa - ii @xcite surveys expect to substantially increase the detection rate of lmc microlensing events in order to provide alerts for sim and dime and to measure the spatial variation of the microlensing optical depth across the face of the lmc .",

    "<S> we present previously unpublished photometry of three large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) microlensing events and show that the new photometry confirms the microlensing interpretation of these events . </S>",
    "<S> these events were discovered by the macho project alert system and were also recovered by the analysis of the 5.7 year macho data set . </S>",
    "<S> this new photometry provides a substantial increase in the signal - to - noise ratio over the previously published photometry and in all three cases , the gravitational microlensing interpretation of these events is strengthened . </S>",
    "<S> the new data consist of macho - global microlensing alert network ( gman ) follow - up images from the ctio 0.9 telescope plus difference imaging photometry of the original macho data from the 1.3 m </S>",

    "<S> we also combine microlensing light curve fitting with photometry from high resolution hst images of the source stars to provide further confirmation of these events and to show that the microlensing interpretation of event macho - lmc-23 is questionable . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare our results with the analysis of belokurov , evans & le du who have attempted to classify candidate microlensing events with a neural network method , and we find that their results are contradicted by the new data and more powerful light curve fitting analysis for each of the four events considered in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the failure of the belokurov , evans & le du method is likely to be due to their use of a set of insensitive statistics to feed their neural networks . </S>"
