    "diffusion in disordered media has been an area of intensive research during the last two decades @xcite .",
    "transport in non - crystalline , disordered materials can not be explained by the classical theories of diffusion since anomalous behaviors ( relative to what happens in the euclidean domain ) are the rule here . in particular , the mean - square displacement of a random walker @xmath4 is no longer proportional to the time @xmath5 as occurs in uniform euclidean systems of any dimension ( fick s law ) , but the more general anomalous diffusion law @xmath6 holds for large times , @xmath7 being the euclidean distance from the position of the random walker at @xmath8 , @xmath9 the anomalous diffusion exponent , and @xmath10 the diffusion constant .",
    "as the geometrical structure of real disordered media is very complex and varied , it is usually modeled by stochastic fractal lattices . of these",
    ", the incipient percolation aggregate embedded in either two or three dimensions is the most widely used @xcite .",
    "statistical problems related to a single random walker have traditionally been the subject of more intensive research than those corresponding to @xmath11 interacting or independent random walkers @xcite .",
    "of course , problems in which the walkers interact can not be analyzed in terms of the single - walker theory .",
    "however , there also exist other multiparticle problems that can not be analyzed in terms of the single - walker theory even though the walkers are independent .",
    "these problems have begun to be the target of in - depth studies during the last decades @xcite .",
    "particular attention has been paid to ( i ) the evaluation of the average number of distinct sites visited up to time @xmath5 by @xmath12 independent random walkers all starting from the same origin in both euclidean and fractal lattices @xcite , and ( ii ) the description of the order statistic of the diffusion processes .",
    "this is the subject we address in this paper and can be stated as follows .",
    "a set of @xmath12 independent random walkers all initially placed at a given site ( the origin ) of a medium start to diffuse at time @xmath8 .",
    "eventually , at time @xmath13 a random walker of this set reaches for the first time a site separated from the origin by the distance @xmath14 .",
    "next , a second random walker reaches at time @xmath15 a site at the same distance @xmath14 from the origin , and so on @xcite .",
    "equivalently , we can understand @xmath16 as the time taken ( escape time or lifetime ) by the @xmath1th particle out of a set of @xmath17 to escape from a `` spherical '' region of radius @xmath14 centered at the starting site of diffusion .",
    "our goal in this paper is to calculate the escape - time moments @xmath18 when @xmath17 random walkers diffuse in a _ disordered _ medium .",
    "this order - statistic problem was solved for the one - dimensional lattice in ref .",

    "the full solution of this problem for euclidean media and for arbitrary @xmath23 and @xmath1 has been obtained recently @xcite .",
    "for all these media , the @xmath23th moment of the time @xmath0 spend by the @xmath1th random walker in reaching the euclidean distance @xmath7 was given in terms of an asymptotic series for large @xmath12 of the form @xmath24 where the coefficients @xmath25 depend on @xmath23 , @xmath1 and the substrate .",
    "the question we want to answer is whether this is also true for disordered media .    the prior knowledge of the _ short - time _ asymptotic expression of the survival probability @xmath26 , which is defined as the probability that a random walker who starts at an origin site has not arrived at a spherical boundary of radius @xmath14 in the time interval @xmath27 , was a key that allowed to find rigorously the full asymptotic approximation for @xmath28 for euclidean and some deterministic fractal media @xcite in refs .",

    "in this paper we deal with the order statistic of the diffusion process in disordered media following the procedure previously carried out in euclidean media @xcite and in ( some class of ) deterministic fractal lattices @xcite .",
    "therefore , our first step must be to propose a short - time asymptotic expression for the survival probability .",
    "the functional form we take coincides with that obtained for euclidean and renormalizable fractal lattices .",

    "this allows us to describe the order statistics of the diffusion process on many kinds of substrates ( namely , euclidean media , and deterministic and _ stochactic _ fractals ) with the same approach and formulae .",
    "a useful feature of the order statistics description is that it allows one to infer properties of the diffusive system ( diffusion constant , number of diffusing particles , concentration of traps , effective dimension of the diffusive substrate ,  ) from the analysis of the behavior of those particles that are trapped first .",
    "this could be an advantage when it is impractical or impossible to wait until the entire reaction is over .",
    "finally , it should be noted that our simulation results for the stochastic fractal we have studied ( the incipient percolation aggregate ) are insufficient to perform a completely reliable numerical fit to the general form of the mortality function @xmath60 with its dominant exponential _ and _ subdominant power - law terms simultaneously .",
    "indeed , even to find the true exponent value @xmath51 of the _ dominant _ term for the propagator is not at all easy as past controversies about that true value reveal . moreover , the value of a hypothetical power - law subdominant term [ equivalent to the term @xmath223 of eq .",
    "( [ hzxi ] ) ] is still a matter of discussion @xcite .",
    "hence , one must expect that to find a completely reliable description of the short - time mortality function will be similarly difficult , and this task will therefore require more detailed simulations on larger lattices , with longer simulation times and , of course , averaging over many more realizations of the lattice than those we have used here . this is simply too much for a common workstation , but we think the effort on more powerful systems would be worthwhile : first , because of the interest in the percolation aggregate as a model of disordered media @xcite , and , second , because simulation of the mortality function ( with circular boundary ) is easier than that of the propagator and , since the asymptotic coefficients and exponents of these two functions are related , estimation of these parameters for the mortality function would help to solve the long - standing controversy on the exact asymptotic form of the propagator in fractal media .",
