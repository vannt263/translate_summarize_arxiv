    "the discovery of the existence of remarkably high stellar velocities was achieved from the analysis of galactic rotation curves @xcite , plots of stellar velocities as a function of their distances from the galactic axis of rotation .",
    "theoretical approaches were devised in the investigation of this mystery , including mond ( see for e.g. @xcite ) and the proposal of dark matter ( see for e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the first introduces an alternative theory to that of newtonian gravity ( ng ) , while the second retains ng proposing the existence of a new kind of matter , designated as dark matter , to provide the extra driving force to induce the high velocities .",
    "another approach @xcite applies general relativity ( gr ) to fit the rotation curves .",
    "it is the general consensus of the great majority of the physics community that general relativity is our best theory of gravity .",
    "however , since in galaxies the gravitational fields are generally weak and their constituent stellar velocities , while very high by our terrestrial standards , are not relativistic , it is normally assumed that ng should suffice to describe galactic gravitational phenomena . while the constraints involving weak - fields and non - relativistic - velocities generally suffice for ng application , it has been shown @xcite that for freely gravitating extended systems of matter under rotation , the dynamical predictions arising from gr depart significantly from those employing newtonian gravity .",
    "our methodology has been vetted by others ( see , for e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "using gr , it was possible to fit four rotation curves @xcite and , subsequently , the approach yielded good fits to three additional galaxies @xcite , with all but one of the subsequent critiques addressed . from these fits ,",
    "the deduced masses were consistently lower than those proposals requiring large stores of dark matter .    in this paper",
    "we go beyond the previous works and utilize the now widely expanded store of observational rotational velocity data to probe galactic structures in greater detail while fitting the rotation curves of four galaxies using gr alone .",
    "we compare our results with observational data of stellar concentrations and the concordance fortifies our confidence in the correctness of the procedure . as in our previous studies , the galactic masses that we deduce",
    "continue to be less than those presented using ng . as a new feature in this paper",
    ", we highlight the mapping of the density as providing a means of determining unseen structures .",
    "the enhanced store of data has enabled us to further apply the criterion of optical galactic radius determination at the threshold density of @xmath0 kg m@xmath1 0.0026 m@xmath2 pc@xmath3 .",
    "this number is close to the average density of the interstellar matter in the vicinity of the sun in the densest molecular regions , where the density varies from@xcite @xmath4 kg m@xmath1 0.029 m@xmath2 pc@xmath3 to @xmath5 kg m@xmath1 0.00029 m@xmath2 pc@xmath3 .",
    "we suggest that the presence of this number in the model may be physically tied to the brightness of molecular clouds in the galaxies . applying this criterion to the milky way",
    ", we found that our own galaxy was indicated to be larger than is generally believed , in fact consistent with the recently announced observations of xu et al .",
    "@xcite the prediction of the larger mw fortifies our confidence in gr as the premier theory of gravity .",
    "besides producing well - fitted rotation curves , we found that the mass density at a radius of @xmath6 kpc from our galaxy s nucleus is @xmath7 kg m@xmath8 0.085 m@xmath2 pc@xmath3 .",
    "this value is close to the observed one@xcite of @xmath9 kg m@xmath1 0.094 m@xmath2 pc@xmath3 where our solar position is believed to lie , between @xmath10 and @xmath11 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "also , the density fall - off in the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane has good concordance with the observational data near our sun within the limits of applicability of the model .",
    "regarding the mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) , assuming that it equals 1 , we found that all galaxies in the sample are expected to present non - luminous matter in variable proportions .",
    "this detailed quantitative result was absent in @xcite and @xcite , although in those papers the role of dark matter within the rotation curve problem was questioned .",
    "we found that according to our gr model , the amount of non - luminous matter in the galaxies is notably smaller than the amount of dark matter expected in the context of newtonian gravity . as we argue in the text , this is a natural consequence of the fact that general relativistic effects are significant in the physics that yields rotation curves .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : intro ] , we introduce the primary general relativistic equations for developing the rotation curves and the underlying galactic density distributions that are used in the following studies .",
    "the details leading up to these equations and the rationale for invoking a stationary axially - symmetric model of a rotating pressure - free fluid as a basis to model a galaxy are dealt with in our earlier papers @xcite and is summarized in appendix [ ap:1 ] .    in sections",
    "[ sec:2403 ] , [ sec:2903 ] and [ sec:5055 ] , we respectively analyze galaxies ngc 2403 , ngc 2903 and ngc 5055 .",
    "each galaxy has its own particular characteristics that were useful to display .    in section [ sec : mw ] , we turn to the milky way , which has its particular challenges stemming from our inability to view it from outside",
    ". however , we have more detailed density data from our advantage in being within .",
    "this has enabled us to test our model .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "in our approach to the problem , we assume that a galaxy s components behave and interact like a low density , freely gravitating fluid without pressure , rotating in stationary , axially - symmetric motion .",
    "this represents an idealized approach to the actual detailed complex galactic dynamics that prevails but it allows a general relativistic solution .",
    "the use of axially - symmetric systems of stars in rotation to study galactic disks is not new @xcite and it provides a powerful tool for a lowest - order approximation .",
    "we present technical details on the approach in appendix [ ap:1 ] .",
    "the metric function relevant for the rotational motion , @xmath12 , can be related to a star s tangential velocity , @xmath13 , according to @xmath14 in the presence of weak fields .",
    "the cylindrical polar coordinates are @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the speed of light in vacuum",
    ".    a functional form can be found for @xmath17 by solving one of einstein s equations , yielding the following expression for @xmath18 : @xmath19 where the @xmath20 are the first - order bessel functions and @xmath21 are the zeroes of @xmath22 , the zeroth - order bessel functions at the @xmath23 limits of integration .",
    "this is the basic equation that we used to obtain our results . by applying actual data points @xmath24 to equation ( [ eq2 ] ) assuming @xmath25 ( invoking the standard approximation of positioning the stars in the galactic midplane ) , we found the corresponding @xmath26-coefficients through the use of the ` bestfit ` function of maple .",
    "these coefficients were substituted back into equation ( [ eq2 ] ) up to a chosen number of parameters ( @xmath27 ) and , using equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , the resulting equation yielded an approximate expression for @xmath12 .",
    "a galaxy s mass density function was calculated from equation ( [ eq : a5]),which can be rewritten as @xmath28 by substituting the partial derivatives ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) of the approximated expression obtained for @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being newton s gravitational constant . from equation ( [ eq3 ] ) we calculated , by volume integration , the galaxy s total mass .",
    "we also used the obtained density functions to check a hypothesis introduced and tested in previous works @xcite , where it was noted that a certain value of the mass density appeared to be related to the optical luminosity threshold for galaxies as tracked in the radial direction .",
    "in other words , for six galaxies investigated thus - far , the mass density was found to be @xmath33 kg m@xmath3 = 0.0026 m@xmath34 pc@xmath3 at @xmath25 and near the radius where the surface brightness in the _ r - band _ of the galaxies reached a minimum value .    in the present work we use the definition of the diameter of a disc galaxy given by the value of the logarithm of the length of the projected major axis of the galaxy at the isophotal limiting surface brightness of @xmath35 mag arcsec@xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this definition reduces all visual diameters to a common standard system . applying cataloged information to this definition , we calculated the optical radius of a galaxy from observed quantities , as we show in appendix [ ap:2 ] .",
    "this value was used in comparison with the value of the radius , @xmath37 , deduced from the position where @xmath38 occurred in our model , thus providing new tests to the hypothesis . in units of solar luminosities",
    "per squared parsec , in the _ r - band _",
    "one finds @xmath35 mag arcsec@xmath39 2.59 l@xmath34 pc@xmath36 .    as pointed out earlier , the density @xmath0 kg m@xmath3 is close to the average density of the interstellar matter in the vicinity of the sun in the densest molecular regions , where this density varies from @xmath4 to @xmath5 kg m@xmath3 .",
    "we , therefore , suggest that the presence of this number in the model may be physically tied to the brightness of molecular clouds in the galaxies , a prediction awaiting more observational evidence .    as to be expected , and as we witnessed in our earlier works , our general relativistic model predicts more mass than that which is predicted on the basis of the visible stellar matter alone .",
    "an excess in the form of non - luminous matter ( nlm ) has been referred to as dark matter ( dm ) by others who have estimated its extent on the basis of ng . moreover , because of the very large extent of the dm component predicted by ng , dm has come to be regarded as solely gravitationally interacting ( and at most possibly also weakly interacting ) matter outside of our known standard model lexicon . on the other hand , with our more modest galactic mass measures derived on the basis of general relativistic dynamics , one might consider the more conservative suggestion that the excess nlm could be undetected normal baryonic matter after all .",
    "we adopt the nlm designation as opposed to the usual dm one to underline our maintaining an open mind as to the true nature of this extra matter .",
    "the rotation curve ( rc ) of ngc 2403 was studied with other approaches @xcite and has a substantial number of data points available @xcite . all the data sets which we used are listed in appendix [ ap:3 ] .",
    "we also use this galaxy as an example and the procedures we used with it , detailed below , were applied to the other galaxies which we will present .    one essential issue to address was the determination of the ideal number of parameters ( @xmath27 ) to limit the expansion in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) and best - fit the rc . after checking the curve fit with a number of parameters",

    "very low density rings are present at radii where the galaxy displays very low brightness .    a particular detail",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : results2403 ] , where the infrared - bright region near the core coincides with the high density region in the theoretical density plot : the densest area extends from the center up to a radius of @xmath52 kpc , followed by a less dense region up to @xmath53 kpc ; beyond this , low - density theoretical rings become the norm .    as noted earlier",
    ", the density in the @xmath42-direction diminishes steeply as is to be expected for a spiral galaxy .",
    "therefore , not only is the rc very well - fitted by our model , but also the theoretical galactic density provides a reasonable insight into the actual structure of ngc 2403 , particularly at radii internal to its minor axis , where the galaxy becomes more circular .",
    "it is noteworthy that , at the galactic midplane , the density curve shows in fig .",
    "[ fig : results2403 ] , a steep descent near the nucleus .",
    "this strong fall - off is an interesting property that arises naturally from the rc data applied to the model , and it repeats in the other galaxies of this study .",
    "its quality resides in the fact that luminosity densities of galaxies also present a strong fall - off and we adhere to the generally - accepted view that galactic luminosity and density are intimately related .",
    "we investigated this relationship within our model by comparing the galactic surface density as calculated from our density expression with luminosity data from de blok et al .",
    "@xcite the result is shown in figure [ fig : lum ] . in order to obtain this figure",
    ", we integrated the gr mass density in @xmath42 up to a value beyond which the surface density did not change significantly .",
    "the figure on the left shows that the surface density curve follows a contour similar to the surface brightness data , reinforcing the qualitative mapping that was presented above .",
    "as well , it shows that @xmath54 is greater than 1 , particularly for large radii indicating the existence of matter in the galaxy that is not observed through luminosity data .",
    "this is the matter that we previously referred to as excess nlm . in what follows",
    "we calculate the total galactic mass as well as the value of the nlm contribution to it , showing that the latter is significantly less than the dark matter mass obtained using ng .",
    "the solid lines correspond to surface density curves , @xmath55 ( in m@xmath2 pc@xmath36 ) , on the left , and their respective log10 curves on the right , for the galaxies ngc 2403 , ngc 2903 and ngc 5055 , calculated with the gr galactic model .",

    "we obtained this value by numerically calculating the surface density for different z - values until a good visual match was found between the surface density curve and the surface brightness data points .",
    "the cut - off z@xmath59 is 4.3@xmath60 of the radius of the last rc data point , @xmath61 kpc ( @xmath62 ) and it signals a limit in the galaxy , in the @xmath42 direction , where visible light would be observed . beyond this point matter is expected to contribute little to the observed luminosity .    with regard to the total galactic mass , integration of the mass density function up to the radius of the last rc data point yielded @xmath63 m@xmath34 , a value that , while larger than that derived by mond @xcite , is considerably lower than others that apply ng @xcite .",
    "we estimated the mass associated with the luminous part of the galaxy by integrating the mass density function within a disk of radius equal to the last rc data point and with height given by two times z@xmath59 , finding @xmath64 m@xmath34 , a value close to the total baryonic mass found in the literature @xcite .",
    "this implies that the mass of the nlm portion of the galaxy in this gr model is @xmath65 m@xmath34 , a value 37.0% smaller than the dm portion of the galaxy calculated by kent@xcite ( @xmath66 m@xmath34 ) .",
    "our result is consistent with the general - relativistic context in the sense that the flattened rc clearly bears the imprint of general relativistic effects that can not be neglected in the system under consideration , effects that are not present when applying newtonian gravity , as we discussed in our earlier papers and which we repeat in appendix [ ap:1 ] .",
    "our surface density result suggests that there may exist more matter in this galaxy than has been observed thus - far .",
    "it is to be noted that the amount of undetected matter indicated by gr is smaller than the dm which is required to fit the data when newtonian gravity is the chosen theory of gravity .",
    "this difference merits further investigation .",
    "clearly the perfect fluid source in our gr model does not differentiate between stars , dust or gas .",
    "there are ongoing efforts to pursue such identification .",
    "for example , regarding the milky way , analysis by gupta et al.@xcite presents the possibility of the existence of a very large , highly massive reservoir of gas in the galaxy , extending to over @xmath67 kpc in galactocentric radius . on the other hand ,",
    "it is noteworthy that this gr model reduces significantly the amount of nlm necessary to fit the galactic rc if one assumes that both the model and the data are sufficiently accurate .",
    "our final note on ngc 2403 refers to the minimal density hypothesis .",

    "one might argue that within the context of astrophysical accuracy , our value is consistent with the contributions from bulge , disk and arms alone .",
    "sofue et al.@xcite had to assume an additional mass contribution from dm in order to fit the galactic rotation curve , which significantly increased their value for the total mass of the milky way ( total mass of 12.5 @xmath131 10@xmath132 m@xmath2 within a radius of 10 kpc and of 20.4 @xmath131 10@xmath132 m@xmath2 within a radius of 20 kpc ) , shown in table [ tab:1 ] . _",
    "the need for dm in this case is between 3 and 6 times the need for nlm in the gr model . _    in @xcite , working with a smaller number of the then available data points for the milky way but using data with radii as far as the 30 kpc range , we witnessed the following for the log 10 density plot ( in figure 7.a of @xcite ) :    1 .   a first crossing of the threshold log 10 density value of -21.75 at a radius of 19 kpc followed by 2 .   a very close hovering below -21.75 with a re - crossing of the threshold value at 21 kpc followed by 3 .",
    "an almost equally close hovering above the threshold value , re - crossing the threshold value at a radius of approximately 23 kpc .",
    "4 .   beyond 23 kpc , the dip below the threshold density value was substantial .",
    "thus , while we reported then an optical radius range of 19 - 21 kpc , arguably it could have been registered as 19 - 23 kpc , based on the above . in the present work",
    ", we had the advantage of access to considerably more data and we concentrated on fitting our curves to match this data .",
    "we focused on the data up to a radius of 15 kpc as the now larger store of available data beyond 15 kpc was rather erratic and not sufficiently meaningful to attempt a fit .",
    "however , using the reliable range up to 15 kpc , we note from figure [ fig : densmw ] that apart from two very narrow ( and hence insignificant ) spikes below the threshold density , the log 10 density plot for the milky way remains above the threshold density value through the entire range up to 15 kpc .",
    "based upon the experience from the other galaxies , it is thus clear that the optical radius of the milky way lies considerably above 15 kpc .",
    "hopefully a greater number of reliable data will become available in the future to extend the detailed rotation curve beyond 15 kpc to enable us to ascertain the value of the threshold crossing point .",
    "assuming that the _ optical _ radius of the galaxy lies in the neighbourhood of 20 kpc , it is possible , based on the general pattern of the other galaxies , that its _ total _ radius lies near @xmath133 kpc .",
    "we predicted this larger radius for the galaxy in communications to conferences in 2013 ( 20@xmath134 grg ) and 2014 ( neb 16 ) .",
    "the very recent publication by xu et al.@xcite includes observational evidence that our galaxy has a radius of at least 20 kpc .",
    "this confirmation of our theory - based prediction lends confidence to the present gr model in the description of galactic dynamics .",
    "assuming that the milky way has a 30 kpc radius , our 29-parameter fit yields a total mass of @xmath135 m@xmath2 while using dark matter in the context of the model by sofue et al.@xcite , we found a total galactic mass of nearly @xmath136 m@xmath2 for this radius .",
    "this indicates that in this case the amount of nlm in the gr context is 33% less than the amount of dm under ng .",
    "the rotation curves for the galaxies generated with our gr model display good fits to the data , which would have been impossible if the newtonian approach were used with our general relativistic mass densities , as we showed .",
    "our model is based upon the assumption of a continuum of pressure - free fluid in perfectly axially symmetric distribution about an axis of rotation .",
    "the reality of a galaxy is that it is only , to a highly varying degree depending upon the galaxy chosen , approximately axially symmetric , although this approximation has yielded many good results in studies of galaxies .",
    "moreover , it is not a continuum but rather consists of concentrations of mass in the form of stars .",
    "these two factors alone must necessarily alter the gravitational field being idealized and hence impose _ a priori _ limitations on what can be expected from our model . in spite of this ,",
    "the concordance with reality that we have witnessed is rather remarkable , considering its inherent limitations .",
    "the gr model can be improved in several ways : first , using a metric that includes more detailed structure of the galaxy , such as bulge and arms ; in the case of the bulge it would be interesting to consider other star velocity patterns , such as the cylindrical rotation pattern which apparently occurs in the milky way@xcite .",
    "second is the use of a particulate structure for the galaxy rather than a fluid , for which we foresee a massive use of numerical computations .",
    "third could be the employment of other solutions instead of ( [ eq : a10 ] ) , as proposed by balasin and grumiller@xcite .",
    "however , even with the solution that we use , other improvements could be applied such as the use of values of @xmath42 other than zero in the determination of rcs .",
    "related to symmetry constraints , while we have @xmath23 and @xmath42 dependence in our functions , @xmath42 dependence in data points is not recorded and @xmath137 dependence is not present in our functions and not present in the data . while the lack in @xmath42 dependence might be seen as not very important ( the disks are fairly compactified ) , the lack of @xmath137 dependence means that we are performing an averaging which is also weighted by our data sampling , according to the @xmath137 sector that is most readily accessible , particularly for observations from our position in the milky way .    of particular note , the theoretical density zones appear to match the images of the galaxies .",
    "this leads us to propose that our method presents a practical first - order mapping of galaxies .",
    "as well this could be viewed as a test of gr beyond the solar system .",
    "the model also allows the determination of the galactic optical radius since the working hypothesis introduced in an earlier paper was confirmed with the galaxies investigated here .",
    "we suggest that the effectiveness of the model in this aspect may be physically tied to the brightness of molecular clouds in galaxies .    moreover , the indications from the modeling point to the milky way having a larger diameter than is generally admitted , a result that was derived from a mass density function that provided good concordance with the local mass density determined by @xcite .",
    "this concordance is one of the improvements that this work makes to @xcite .    also regarding the milky way , as new , more accurate data points become available for radii beyond @xmath138 kpc",
    ", we expect that our rotation curve will present an even a better fit , particularly for larger radii .",
    "our good matching of the milky way rotation curve led to a predicted density of matter in our solar neighbourhood that is close to the observed density . on the other hand ,",
    "newtonian gravity modeling still requires some dm even at our position in the galaxy@xcite .    by investigating the galactic m / l",
    ", we concluded that a significant amount of yet - unseen matter ( nlm ) is expected to be present in galaxies .",
    "we calculated this fraction and compared it to the fraction of dm estimated using newtonian gravity .",
    "we found that the amount of nlm is significantly less than the amount of dm .",
    "therefore , while at this stage we can not know the precise nature of the nlm that we have deduced to be present , it is considerably more modest in extent than the dm extent claimed on the basis of newtonian gravitational dynamics .",
    "this leads us to feel more comfortable with the hypothesis that it will ultimately be shown to be normal matter within the standard model of particle physics .",
    "finally , the indications from the modeling point to the milky way having a larger diameter than is generally admitted , a result that was derived from a mass density function that provided good concordance with the local mass density@xcite .",

    "these constraints encompass a degree of clumping of matter in the form of rings which , in more detailed future studies , may evolve into the arms which we actually observe . the absence of pressure is physically justified by the usually very low matter densities present in the galactic environment .    from the outset",
    ", we apply general relativity , having seen in earlier work @xcite that the non - linearities come into play in the description of the galactic dynamics for a continuum of particles in free - fall .",
    "many years ago it was shown in @xcite that the spacetime in the interior of an axially - symmetric distribution of particles rotating in stationary motion around an axis of symmetry had a particular metric form .",
    "we adopt this metric here and rewrite it conveniently as @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath17 are functions of the cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath23 , @xmath42 .",
    "the cylindrical polar angle in this system is @xmath137 and @xmath16 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "we adopt the convention @xmath141 for the minkowski metric , with spacetime indices running from 0 to 3 so that @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 .    because of the stationary , axially - symmetric constraint , particles will only display different angular velocities for different values of the @xmath23 and @xmath42 coordinates .",
    "since we are interested in studying variations in stellar linear velocities with their distances to the galactic center , we first determine those angular velocities .    by adopting a system of reference relative to which the matter is at rest , i. e. , to a system that is comoving with the matter , the actual angular velocity , @xmath146 , of a particle located at a given position @xmath147 relative to the local non - corotating frame",
    "can be found by locally diagonalizing the metric , yielding @xmath148    in the limit @xmath149 , which is the case for the low density fluids that we are dealing with , the local angular velocity admits the simple form    @xmath150    equation ( [ eq : a3 ] ) is the link between the key metric function @xmath31 and the actual rotational motion of the fluid .",
    "it is to be noted that with the large galactic sizes involved , we treat the stars as well as the constituents of the intergalactic gas as particles as a first approximation .",
    "a star s tangential velocity , @xmath13 , is given in the non - rotating frame by @xmath151    this expression shows that from the knowledge of @xmath31 we can determine a galaxy s rotation curve ( the star s velocity as a function of its galactocentric distance ) , for different heights , @xmath42 , relative to the galactic midplane .",
    "we obtain this function as well as information on the galaxy s mass density with the aid of einstein s equations .    for the system under the above conditions , and with terms retained up to the order of the first power of @xmath32 ( newton s gravitational constant ; @xcite presents details on this approximation criterion ) , einstein s equations yield the following expression for n : @xmath152 where the subscripts @xmath23 and @xmath42 denote partial differentiation with respect to the respective coordinates .",
    "this equation reveals the non - linear relation between the pressureless , stationary , freely gravitating rotational motion ( embodied in the field @xmath17 ) and the mass distribution ( represented by @xmath153 ) .",
    "einstein s equations also give @xmath154 solving this equation yields the @xmath17 function required for the determination of the rotation curve of the galaxy from equation ( [ eq : a4 ] ) .    by defining @xmath155 equation ( [ eq : a6 ] )",
    "can be expressed in the form of laplace s equation @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the flat - space laplacian operator .",
    "this shows that @xmath158 , the generator of the @xmath17 field by definition , is composed of flat - space harmonic functions , which also relate to the stars velocities , according to equation ( [ eq : a4 ] ) , as @xmath159 the determination of the rotation curve is tied to the determination of @xmath158 .    since equation ( [ eq : a8 ] ) is linear , we can choose a linear superposition of harmonic solutions as @xmath160 where @xmath161 are the zeroth - order bessel functions and the @xmath26 are constants dependent upon the galaxy s characteristics .",
    "in our analysis we use equation ( [ eq : a10 ] ) in the @xmath162 direction alone and , to include the whole range in @xmath42 , we mirror the @xmath162 result into the @xmath163 region , following the natural simplifying approximation of galactic reflection symmetry relative to the @xmath41 plane .",
    "bessel functions of integer order are common in many problems which are solved in cylindrical polar coordinate systems .",
    "they are solutions to bessel s equation , which arises when finding separable solutions to laplace s equation @xcite .",
    "the constants @xmath21 are the zeroes of @xmath22 at the range of integration and are calculated from the orthogonality relation that these functions must satisfy .",
    "they are readily obtainable in computational packages such as maple .",
    "a solution like equation ( [ eq : a10 ] ) , presented in the literature previously , focused on solving einstein s equations with lanczos metric @xcite but with motivations other than the rotation curve problem . here",
    "the linear superposition given by the summation over a number of parameters , @xmath27 , allows us to calculate @xmath158 up to the level of accuracy required with rotation curve matching as the focus .",
    "the solution ( [ eq : a10 ] ) applied to equation ( [ eq : a9 ] ) yields @xmath164 where the @xmath20 are the first - order bessel functions .",
    "this is the basic equation that we used to obtain our results . by applying real data",
    "points @xmath165 to equation ( [ eq : a11 ] ) assuming @xmath25 ( invoking the standard approximation of positioning the stars in the galactic midplane ) , we found the corresponding @xmath26-coefficients through the use of the ` bestfit ` function of maple .",
    "these coefficients were then substituted back into equation ( [ eq : a11 ] ) up to a chosen number of parameters and the resulting equation yielded an expression for @xmath31 using equation ( [ eq : a4 ] ) .",
    "finally , the galaxy s density was calculated from equation ( [ eq : a5 ] ) , determining , by volume integration , the galaxy s total mass . in the density plots we noted that there is an increase in density at the largest radius , which is a computational feature at the boundary rather than a physical characteristic of the object .",

    "<S> we map the density contours of the galaxies , achieving good concordance with observational data . in our solar neighbourhood </S>",
    "<S> , we found a mass density and density fall - off fitting observational data satisfactorily . from our gr results , using the threshold density related to the observed optical zone of a galaxy , we had found that the milky way was indicated to be considerably larger than had been believed to be the case . to our knowledge , this was the only such existing theoretical prediction ever presented . </S>",
    "<S> very recent observational results by xu et al . have confirmed our prediction . as in our previous studies , galactic masses </S>",
    "<S> are consistently seen to be higher than the baryonic mass determined from observations but still notably lower than those deduced from the approaches relying upon dark matter in a newtonian context . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the non - luminous fraction of matter for our sample of galaxies that is derived from applying general relativity to the dynamics of the galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence points to general relativity playing a key role in the explanation of the stars high velocities in galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> mapping galactic density contours directly from the dynamics opens a new window for predicting galactic structure . </S>"
