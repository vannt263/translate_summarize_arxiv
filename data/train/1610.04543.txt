    "recently , the gravitational waves which are the solutions of the einstein equations and are the part of the most interesting astrophysical events were observed by ligo @xcite .",
    "the einstein equations are sets of the nonlinear partial differential equations with constraints , numerical calculations are the realistic tools to study these equations for the actual physical events in the universe such as the gravitational waves . analyzing the einstein equations",
    "numerically is called `` numerical relativity '' , these studies made a substantial contribution to observe the gravitational wave events .",
    "these discoveries must open new physical fields to survey of lots of astrophysical events .",
    "therefore , it is important to improve numerical techniques to make high accuracy numerical results .",
    "although , there are some researches of the suitable numerical schemes of the einstein equations(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) , it is not enough to perform precisely simulations .",
    "however , it would be hardly to make best discretized equations of the einstein equations because of the strong nonlinearity .",
    "in addition , some of the characteristics in the continuous system are often lost in the process of transforming the continuous equation to the discretized one .",
    "there are some discretized schemes of preserving properties of the continuous equations .",
    "one of the schemes is the discrete variational derivative method ( dvdm ) .",
    "dvdm was proposed and has been extended by furihata , mori , matsuo , and yaguchi @xcite , and this method is one of the structure - preserving methods @xcite .",
    "the method of formulating a discrete system using dvdm is similar to the variational principle . in the variational principle",
    ", we provide a generator function such as the lagrange density and we can obtain a continuous system using the functional derivative of the function . on the other hand , in dvdm , we provide a discretized generator function of the system and we can obtain a discrete system using the discrete variational derivative . the crank - nicolson scheme ( cns ) and",
    "the runge - kutta scheme are general methods of discretizing equations , these schemes often use in numerical relativity . on the other hand",
    ", dvdm is a specific method of preserving constraints and diffusion characteristics in the continuous system .",
    "since the einstein equations include the constraints , dvdm can provide a discretized einstein equations with constraint preserving properties .    before we try to make the discretized einstein equations using dvdm , we studied the discretized maxwell s equations using the method because of the complexities of the einstein equations@xcite .",
    "the maxwell s equations are classified the hyperbolic equations with constraints , the characters of the system are similar to those of the einstein equations . in @xcite",
    ", the authors studied the numerical stabilities for the maxwell s equations using dvdm , and showed that dvdm is effective to perform stable simulations in the system .    in this letter , indices such as @xmath0 run from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "we use the einstein convention of summation of repeated up - down indices .",
    "now , we review the processes of the standard method of discretized equations using general schemes and the new way using dvdm .",
    "the discrete values of the variable @xmath3 are defined as @xmath4 .",
    "the upper index @xmath5 and lower index @xmath6 denote the time components , and space components , respectively .",
    "the details of this are in ref .",
    "we adopt only the canonical formulation in this letter , so that these processes are only shown in the case that the generator function is the hamiltonian density .",
    "first , we introduce the process of the general case of constructing the discrete equations such as cns and the runge - kutta scheme .",
    "( a ) : we set a hamiltonian density @xmath7 with the variables @xmath8 and the canonical conjugate momenta @xmath9 .",
    "( b ) : the dynamical equations are given as @xmath10 then we discretize the continuous equations following the ideas of the schemes such as cns and the runge - kutta scheme .",
    "next , the processes of discrete equations using dvdm are as follows : ( a@xmath11 ) : we set a discrete hamiltonian density @xmath12 with the discrete variables @xmath13 and the discrete canonical conjugate momenta @xmath14 .",
    "( b@xmath11 ) : the calculation of the discretized system using dvdm is @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are calculated as @xmath18",
    "the lagrangian density of the einstein equations is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is lapse function , @xmath22 is the determinant of the three - metric @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the three - scalar curvature .",
    "@xmath25 is the extrinsic curvature , @xmath26 .",
    "the word gr means the general relativity . with the variables @xmath23 and the canonical momenta @xmath27 , the hamiltonian formulation of the einstein equations can be constructed .",
    "this formulation was given by arnowitt , deser , and misner ( adm ) , this is the first successful decomposition of the einstein equations to space and time @xcite .",
    "if we discretize the equations of the formulation with dvdm , we face to two difficulties .",
    "first is discretizing of @xmath22 .",
    "the variational of @xmath22 in continuous case is @xmath28 it is hard to make the above relation in discretized case .",
    "then , we use the conformal transformation such as @xmath29 to vanish @xmath22 in the lagrangian density . these relations are derived from following two conditions : ( i ) the lagrangian density @xmath30 does not include @xmath31 , ( ii ) the evolution equation of @xmath32 does not include @xmath31 .",
    "if these conditions are satisfied , the @xmath31 is not also included in the expression of the hamiltonian density @xmath33 derived from the legendre transformation of the lagrangian density .",
    "thus , the canonical formulation using @xmath33 does not include @xmath31 . with",
    ", the lagrangian density can be expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the scalar curvature of @xmath32 , @xmath36 is the connection of @xmath32 , + @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "note that the expressions of @xmath30 and @xmath39 are different , but they are same , that is to say @xmath40 .",
    "the relation can be derived in straightforward .",
    "then the hamiltonian density is defined as @xmath41 next is construction of suitable discretization of the @xmath24 .",
    "this is defined as in continuous case such as @xmath42 note that there are the same relations between @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath32 .",
    "this means that the conformal transformation does not overcome the difficulty of @xmath24 .",
    "therefore we treat only @xmath19 to simplify @xmath24 in this letter .",
    "if @xmath33 is the function of only @xmath19 , then the density can be expressed as @xmath43 the evolution equations are @xmath44 and the constraint equation is @xmath45 in the adm formulation , the constraint values are the hamiltonian constraint @xmath46 and the momentum constraints @xmath47 , thus there are four constraints .",
    "however , there is only one equation of constraint in the above set of equations .",
    "this is because we treat the case of @xmath33 as only @xmath19 function .",
    "if we treat the case of @xmath48 as @xmath49 function , there are four constraint equations in the new formulation .",
    "the evolution equation of can be derived as @xmath50 then the hamiltonian constraint is satisfied in the evolutions .",
    "we call the evolution equation of constraint as constraint propagation ( cp ) .",
    "we set the discrete hamiltonian density as @xmath51 then , the discretized evolution equations with dvdm are @xmath52 the discretized cp is derived as @xmath53 thus , the discretized cp of dvdm is the same as the continuous case .      to compare with the numerical stability of the discrete system using dvdm , we select the crank - nicolson scheme ( cns ) which is used in the numerical relativity .",
    "the discrete evolution equations with cns are @xmath54 and the discretized cp with the scheme is @xmath55 this is not equal zero in general because that the terms @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are not equal zero .",
    "therefore , the constraint values would be changed of initial values using the cns .",
    "we perform some simulations to study differences of the constraint violations using the two schemes .",
    "then , we adopt the initial condition as @xmath60 this is the kasner solution which is one of the exact solutions of the einstein equations .",
    "this solution expresses the expanding universe , and there is a singularity at @xmath61 .",
    "then the initial conditions of @xmath21 , @xmath23 , and @xmath25 are given by @xmath62 and using the relations of becomes as @xmath63 in addition , it is hardly to make constraint violations in the above condition .",
    "then , we add perturbations such as @xmath64 the other conditions in these simulations given by    * initial time : @xmath65 . * time steps : @xmath66 .",
    "* @xmath21(gauge condition ) : exact solution of . *",
    "boundary condition : periodic .",
    "there are @xmath67 time step variables in the discretized evolution equations using dvdm and cns ( - and - , respectively ) . in the simulations ,",
    "the variables are calculated in iterative because of the nonlinearlity , then we set the numbers of times of iteration as fourth order in both schemes .",
    "and horizontal axis means time .",
    "the solid line is drawn by dvdm and the dotted line is by cns .",
    "the line of cns is grow up after initial time . on the other hand ,",
    "the one of dvdm is horizontal in the simulations .",
    "[ fig : hamiltonain ] ]    fig.[fig : hamiltonain ] is the constraint violations using dvdm and cns . in this figure ,",
    "the solid line which is drawn by dvdm is horizontal , and the dotted line which is drawn by cns is rising .",
    "this means that the values of the constraint @xmath48 of dvdm is unchanged in the evolution . on the other hand",
    ", that of cns is increasing from the initial values .",
    "therefore , these results are consistent with the results of analyzing cp in sec.[sec : discretizedeqs ] .",
    "we derived suitable discretized equations of the einstein equations using the discrete variational derivative method ( dvdm ) . in the process of the discretization , there are two difficulties .",
    "one is the existence of the determinant of @xmath23 , @xmath22 , in the lagrangian density , and the other is the complexity of the scalar curvature @xmath68 included in the density . for the existence of @xmath22 , we eliminated it by the conformal transformation of the variables . for the complexity of @xmath68 , we restricted the coordinate as only @xmath19",
    ". then , we derived the discretized evolution equations of the variables and constraint in dvdm and the crank - nicolson scheme ( cns ) , showed the discrete constraint of dvdm is unchanged and the one of cns is changed .",
    "in addition , we performed some simulations using the discretized equations of the dvdm and cns . then , the constraint values using the dvdm were conserved . on the other hand ,",
    "the values using cns were not conserved .",
    "these results are consistent with the analysis of the discretized evolution equations of the constraint using the dvdm and cns .",
    "therefore the dvdm is the validity to perform stable simulations in the numerical relativity .    in this letter",
    ", we restricted the coordinates to simplify the complexities of the scalar curvature @xmath24 . to perform realistic simulations",
    ", we should handle the @xmath24 in the coordinates @xmath49 .",
    "so we would like to try it in the future work .",
