    "bilayer membranes self - assembled from amphiphilic molecules are important components of biological and physiochemical systems . in particular , bilayers self - assembled from lipids are ubiquitous in the cell , separating the cell from the exterior environment as well as encasing its internal organelle structures .",
    "numerous biological functions are associated with the deformation , fusion and fission of lipid membranes @xcite .",
    "amphiphilic molecules , or apmphiphiles , are molecules composed of hydrophilic and hydrophobic components .",
    "examples of amphiphiles include lipids , surfactants and block copolymers .",
    "due to the competing hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions , amphiphilic molecules in aqueous solution spontaneously self - assemble into a variety of structures including spherical micelles , cylindrical micelles , and bilayers @xcite .",
    "one extremely interesting and important self - assembled structure is the bilayer , in which the hydrophilic parts are located on the outer surface of the bilayer whereas the hydrophobic blocks are hidden in the interior of the membrane . at the molecular scale ,",
    "the lateral arrangement of the molecules in a bilayer membrane is disordered , thus the membrane could be regarded as a two - dimensional fluid . at the mesoscopic scale ,",
    "bilayer membranes could be regarded as two - dimensional surfaces embedded in the three - dimensional space .",
    "the unique structure of self - assembled bilayers results in several intriguing properties @xcite : the bilayers can form closed membranes without edges , such as vesicles and cell walls ; they are extremely flexible and highly deformable ; and despite their flexibility , they keep their structural integrity even under strong deformations .",
    "the morphology formed by the self - assembled bilayer membranes is strongly affected by the property of the amphiphilic molecules .",
    "phenomenologically , a bilayer membrane could be modelled as a two - dimensional surface .",
    "the formation and stability of membrane morphologies could then be understood by considering the mechanical property of this surface .",
    "assuming the deformation from equilibrium state is small , the energy of a deformed bilayer membrane can be described by a linear elasticity theory , resulting in the celebrated helfrich model of membranes @xcite .",
    "specifically the elastic energy of the helfrich model of an open membrane is given by , @xmath0 { \\mathrm{d}}a + \\int \\sigma { \\mathrm{d}}l,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the local mean and gaussian curvatures of the deformed bilayer ( @xmath3 are the two principal curvatures ) .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : helfrich ] ) represents the edge energy of an open membrane , and it vanishes for closed membranes .",
    "@xmath4 is the surface tension ( surface energy per unit area ) of the membrane . for a tensionless membrane @xmath5 .",
    "the energetics of a bilayer is specified by the elastic constants , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , corresponding to the spontaneous curvature , the bending modulus , the gaussian modulus and the edge line tension , respectively .",
    "it should be noticed that the helfrich free energy is a linear elastic model , which includes only the lowest - order contributions to the free energy from the curvatures .",
    "higher - order contributions should be included if the curvature of the membrane is high .",
    "the mechanical property of the membrane within this surface model are characterized by a set of mechanical parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ , the surface tension @xmath4 , spontaneous curvature @xmath6 , bending modulus @xmath7 , and gaussian modulus @xmath8 . for an open membrane ,",
    "its energetic depends further on the line tension @xmath9 , which is the edge energy per unit length of the membrane .",
    "the elastic properties can be used to analyze and explain numerous phenomena associated with vesicle shape and deformation , membrane fusion , and other relevant membrane activities @xcite .",
    "the line tension of an open edge is a key parameter for understanding the processes of disc - to - vesicle transformation @xcite , vesicle - pore formation @xcite and membrane fusion @xcite .    in the study of bilayer membranes ,",
    "one of the main objectives for experimentalists and theorists is to determine these elastic parameters and to understand their physical origins . in particular ,",
    "a great number of theoretical and experimental studies have focused on the relationship between the molecular properties , such as composition , geometrical shape and interactions between lipid species , of the amphiphilic molecules and the mechanical properties of the self - assembled membranes @xcite .",
    "experimentally a number of techniques have been developed for the measurement of bending moduli of lipid membranes @xcite .",
    "a large body of knowledge about the elastic properties of lipid membranes has been obtained from these experiments , although uncertainties about these properties remain @xcite . besides experimental measurements",
    ", simulation methods have been developed to obtain the elastic constants of bilayer membranes @xcite . because free energy is not available directly from most of the simulation techniques , studying the elastic constants of membranes in simulations",
    "largely depends on either monitoring the thermal fluctuations of a membrane , or by integrating the local contributions from the pressure tensors .",
    "furthermore , measuring the gaussian modulus presents a challenge to simulations since the change of the gaussian curvature contribution to the free energy of close membranes only occurs when there are topological changes of the system .",
    "an alternative strategy to obtain the elastic constants of membranes is to compare the free energy of membranes with different shapes of definite curvatures . by studying bilayers in different geometries ( _ e.g. _ planes , cylinders , spheres )",
    ", it is possible to obtain several elastic constants simultaneously .",
    "this approach requires an accurate computation of the free energy of the curved membranes , which can be implemented using different coarse - grained model of the amphiphilic molecules . among the different theoretical frameworks developed for amphiphilic molecules , the self - consistent field theory ( scft )",
    "provides a versatile platform for the study of self - assembled bilayer membranes . the self - consistent field theory is originally developed for the study of inhomogeneous polymeric systems @xcite .",
    "it has been shown by numerous researchers in the past decades that the scft provides a flexible and accurate framework for the study of self - assembled structures included the ordered phases of multiblock copolymers @xcite and complex micelles @xcite .",

    "furthermore , numerical calculations using the self - consistent field theory have been carried out to study the elastic properties of bilayers , using diblock copolymer / homopolymer blends as a coarse - grained model to mimic the amphiphile / solvent system @xcite . in these theoretical studies ,",
    "the focus has been on relating the elastic properties to the molecular parameters of the amphiphilic molecules .    in this paper , we review recent application of self - consistent field theory to the study of the mechanical properties of self - assembled bilayer membranes .",

    "we focus on a coarse - grained model in which the molecule species are modelled as flexible polymers @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this formulation of the self - consistent field theory is that the single - molecular partition function can be computed by solving a modified diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that the amphiphilic molecules can also be modelled using lattice models @xcite or rotational isomeric state models @xcite . in the scft formulation ,",
    "the bilayer membrane is described by a microscopic model of flexible amphiphilic chains ( ab diblock copolymers ) dissolved in hydrophilic solvent molecules ( a homopolymers ) .",
    "free energy of self - assembled bilayer membranes with specific shapes is obtained by solving the corresponding scft equations .",
    "the mechanical parameters of the membranes can be extracted by fitting the scft free energies of membranes with different geometries to an appropriate energy expression for the continuum elastic model @xcite .",

    "we then give a brief review of the self - consistent field theory formulated in grand canonical ensemble @xcite , which is used to compute the free energy of a self - assembled bilayer membrane .",
    "finally we describe the implementation of scft in different geometries , which is used to extract the elastic constants .",
    "there are many types of amphiphilic molecules ranging from small molecular surfactants to macromolecular analogues such as diblock copolymers . despite the variation of the molecular details ,",
    "the self - assembly behaviour of the amphiphilic molecules are determined mainly by a few common features of the molecules , _",
    "i.e. _ the relative strength of the hydrophilic - hydrophobic interactions and the relative size of the two components .",
    "it has been demonstrated that coarse - grained model of amphiphilic molecules could provide useful information about the thermodynamic behaviour of the self - assembled bilayer membranes @xcite . in this review",
    "we will focus on one particularly useful coarse - grained model in which the molecular species are modelled as flexible polymers @xcite .",

    "extension of this simple model to include electrostatic interactions and more complex block copolymer architectures @xcite , as well as to multicomponent bilayer membranes @xcite , is straightforward .    in the simplest polymeric model of an amphiphilic molecule ,",
    "the hydrophilic and hydrophobic part is represented by the a and b blocks , which are connected at their ends to form a single diblock copolymer chain .",
    "the molecular parameters characterizing an ab diblock copolymer chain are its total length , or the degree of polymerization , @xmath11 and the lengths of the hydrophilic ( a ) and hydrophobic ( b ) blocks , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "equivalently the composition of the amphiphile can be described by the volume fraction of the hydrophilic blocks in the amphiphile , @xmath15 . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that both the copolymers and the homopolymers have equal chain length characterized by a degree of polymerization @xmath11 .",

    "the interaction between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers is described by the flory - huggins parameter @xmath19 .      for the specific coarse - grained model or the ab / a mixtures ,",
    "the task is to , first of all , demonstrate that self - assembly does occur in the model system leading to the formation of bilayer membranes",
    ". then the free energy of the self - assembled membranes should be obtained so that the mechanical constants of the membrane could be extracted from the theory . the polymeric self - consistent field theory ( scft )",

    "the scft of polymers was originally developed to study the thermodynamic behaviour of inhomogeneous polymer phases .",
    "due the efforts of a large number of researchers , efficient methods to solve the scft equations have been developed , enabling the study of complex ordered phases of block copolymers as well as micellar morphologies of block copolymer solutions .",
    "one advantage of scft is that the theory provides an accurate calculation of the free energy of the system .",
    "details of the general theory of scft are found in a number of review articles and monographs @xcite . in what follows",

    "for example , proper description of the orientational order of the lipids tails would require extending the flexible polymeric model to semiflexible chain model .",
    "when a non - gaussian polymer model is used , the scft field theory should be extended to properly account the conformational statistics and the scft equations should be modified accordingly . secondly many membrane configurations may be metastable or even unstable , thus requiring an extension of the theory to non - equilibrium structures .",
    "for example , the lipid composition of the inner and outer leaflets of many biological membranes are different .",
    "the asymmetric composition arises naturally in cell membranes when the lipids are generated and initially inserted into the inner leaflet , and the asymmetry often persists over long periods of time because the spontaneous flip - flop of lipids between two leaflets is extremely slow @xcite . the current scft model in general deals with thermodynamical equilibrium",
    "thus it is challenging to treat dynamic processes .",
    "techniques exploring the free energy landscape @xcite could provide useful information for the understanding of morphological transitions of membranes .",
    "thirdly , many biological processes involve protein - membrane interactions @xcite .",
    "it is therefore desirable to develop coarse - grained models for proteins and membranes .",
    "application of scft to coarse - grained model of proteins and lipids could lead to insights on how different proteins affect the curvature and structure of membranes .",
    "finally , the computation of the elastic constants is done by fitting the excess free energy to the helfich model .",
    "it would be useful to derive the helrich model from the scft theory , so that these elastic constants could be calculated from the knowledge of the scft solutions of the bilayers .",
    "such a theoretical framework would also provide useful insights into the factors affecting the elasticity of the bilayers .",
    "we are grateful to jiajia zhou , ashkan dehghan and jianfeng li for many valuable discussions .",
