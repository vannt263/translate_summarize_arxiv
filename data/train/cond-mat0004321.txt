    "<S> meanders are considered distinct up to any smooth deformation leaving the line fixed . </S>",
    "<S> this problem seems to date back at least to the work of poincar on differential geometry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since then it has from time to time been studied by mathematicians in various contexts such as the folding of a strip of stamps @xcite or folding of maps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently it has been related to enumerations of ovals in planar algebraic curves @xcite and the classification of 3-manifolds @xcite . during the last decade or </S>",
    "<S> so it has received considerable attention in other areas of science . in computer science meanders </S>",
    "<S> are related to the sorting of jordan sequences @xcite and have been used for lower bound arguments @xcite . in physics meanders </S>",
    "<S> are relevant to the study of compact foldings of polymers @xcite , properties of the temperley - lieb algebra @xcite , matrix models @xcite , and models of low - dimensional gravity @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a _ closed meander _ of order @xmath0 is a closed self - avoiding loop crossing an infinite line @xmath4 times ( see figure  [ fig : meanclose ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the meandric number @xmath5 is simply the number of such meanders distinct up to smooth transformations . </S>",
    "<S> note that each meander forms a single connected loop . </S>",
    "<S> the number of closed meanders is expected to grow exponentially , with a sub - dominant term given by a critical exponent , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the exponential growth constant @xmath7 is often called the _ connective constant_. thus the generating function is expected to behave as    @xmath8    and hence have a singularity at @xmath9 with exponent @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the first meandric numbers are @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> one can extend the definition to _ multi - component systems of closed meanders _ </S>",
    "<S> , where we allow configurations with several disconnected closed loops . </S>",
    "<S> the meandric numbers @xmath14 are then the number of meanders with @xmath4 crossings and @xmath15 independent loops .     a few examples of closed meanders of order 2 and 3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> ]    an _ open meander _ of order @xmath0 is a self - avoiding curve running from west to east while crossing an infinite line @xmath0 times . </S>",
    "<S> the number of such curves is @xmath16 and we can define a generating function for this problem in analogy with ( [ eq : meangen ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted @xcite that @xmath17 , and hence the critical exponent is identical to that of closed meanders and the connective constant is @xmath7 .    finally , instead of looking at intersections with an infinite line one could consider a semi - infinite line and allow the curve to wind around the end - point of the line @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a _ </S>",
    "<S> semi - meander _ of order @xmath0 is a closed self - avoiding loop crossing the semi - infinite line @xmath0 times . the number of semi - meanders of order @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath18 and we define a generating function as in ( [ eq : meangen ] ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> a further interesting generalization is to study the number of semi - meanders @xmath19 which wind around the end - point of the line exactly @xmath20 times . </S>",
    "<S> again we could also study systems of multi - component semi - meanders according to the number of independent loops . </S>",
    "<S> two semi - meanders are shown in figure  [ fig : meansemi ] .     two examples of semi - meanders . </S>",
    "<S> the first one has a single loop , wind around the origin once , and contain 7 crossings . </S>",
    "<S> the second semi - meander has 4 loops ( labelled a  </S>",
    "<S> d ) , wind around the origin 3 times , and again contain 7 crossings . ]    in a recent paper it was argued that the meander problem is related to the gravitational version of a certain loop model @xcite . from the conformal field theory of the model , </S>",
    "<S> conjectures were proposed for the exact critical exponent of closed and open meanders , @xmath21 , as well as the exponent for semi - meanders , @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this work has recently been extended to multi - component systems of closed and semi - meanders @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> conjectures were then given for the critical exponents as functions of the loop - fugacity @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> these were checked numerically @xcite and found to be correct within numerical error . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we analyse extended series for the meander generating functions . using differential approximants we obtain accurate estimates for the exponents and find that the conjecture for the semi - meander exponent is unlikely to be correct , while the conjecture for closed meanders is not inconsistent with the results from the analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty in the enumeration of most interesting combinatorial problems is that , computationally , they are of exponential complexity . </S>",
    "<S> initial efforts at computer enumeration of meanders were based on direct counting . </S>",
    "<S> lando and zvonkin @xcite studied closed meanders , open meanders and multi - component systems of closed meanders , while di francesco _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite studied semi - meanders . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we use a new and improved algorithm @xcite , based on transfer matrix methods , to enumerate various meander problems such as closed , open and semi - meanders . </S>",
    "<S> the method is similar to the transfer matrix technique devised by enting @xcite in his pioneering work on the enumeration of self - avoiding polygons . </S>",
    "<S> the first terms in the series for the meander generating function can be calculated using transfer matrix techniques . </S>",
    "<S> this involves drawing an intersection perpendicular to the infinite line . </S>",
    "<S> meanders are enumerated by successive moves of the intersection , so that one crossing at a time is added to the meanders . </S>",
    "<S> a preliminary description of the algorithm can be found in @xcite and further details will appear elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> a very closely related algorithm was used and described in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> .[tab : closed ] the number , @xmath5 , of connected closed meanders with @xmath4 crossings . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we analyzed the series by the numerical method of differential approximants @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of the critical point and critical exponents were obtained by averaging values obtained from inhomogeneous differential approximants chosen such that most , if not all , series terms were used . </S>",
    "<S> some approximants were excluded from the averages because the estimates were obviously spurious . </S>",
    "<S> the error quoted for these estimates reflects the spread ( basically one standard deviation ) among the approximants . </S>",
    "<S> note that these error bounds should _ not _ be viewed as a measure of the true error as they can not include possible systematic sources of error . in table  [ </S>",
    "<S> tab : analysis ] we have listed the results from this analysis . </S>",
    "<S> our first observation is that the critical points of open and semi - meanders are identical , and thus so are the connective constants @xmath7 for all the problems ( recall that for closed meanders @xmath9 ) </S>",
    "<S> . clearly the most accurate estimates are obtained from the semi - meander series and from this we estimate , conservatively , that @xmath24 and thus @xmath25 . secondly , as expected open and closed meanders have the same critical exponent , which we estimate to be @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this could , though only marginally , be consistent with the conjectured value @xmath21 . for semi - meanders we estimate @xmath27 , </S>",
    "<S> which is not consistent with the conjecture @xmath22 .     </S>",
    "<S> estimates of the critical exponents of the semi - meander generating function , @xmath28 , and the open meander generating function , @xmath29 , vs. the number of terms from the series used by the differential approximants . </S>",
    "<S> each point represents an estimate obtained from a particular 2 . </S>",
    "<S> order differential approximant . ]    in order to gain a better understanding of the behaviour of the exponent estimates it is useful to plot them against the number of terms used to form the differential approximant . in particular we can check whether or not the estimates asymptote or whether they are drifting with the length of the series . in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ntexp ] we have done this for semi - meanders and open meanders . </S>",
    "<S> these plots strongly reinforce the comments made above . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent estimates for semi - meanders increase as more terms are used and appear to settle down to an asymptotic value above the conjectured value . for open meanders </S>",
    "<S> the exponent estimates decrease and approach the conjectured value as more terms are used . </S>",
    "<S> it is quite likely that with a longer series the estimates would actually converge to the conjectured value , though it is also possible that the estimates could settle at a value just above the conjectured value . </S>",
    "<S> if we look at the estimates in table  [ tab : analysis ] we note that for both open and closed meanders the exponent estimates decrease as the critical point estimates increase . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that as @xmath30 approaches the estimate obtained from semi - meanders the exponent estimates approach the conjectured value . to check this we plotted ( in figure  [ fig : crpexp ] ) the exponent estimates vs the critical point estimates for open and closed meanders . </S>",
    "<S> the solid lines are the conjectured exponent value and the best estimate for the critical point based on the semi - meander analysis . </S>",
    "<S> clearly the estimates pass extremely close to the intersection between the solid lines , lending further support to the possibility that the conjecture for @xmath31 is correct .     </S>",
    "<S> estimates of the critical exponents for open ( left panel ) and closed meanders vs. the corresponding critical point estimates . ]    </S>",
    "<S> next we looked for non - physical singularities and found that both the open and semi - meander generating functions have a singularity at @xmath32 with an exponent whose value is consistent with @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> these generating functions also have a pair of singularities in the complex plane at @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent estimates are quite poor , but consistent with the value @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we turned our attention to the `` fine - structure '' of the asymptotic behaviour of the meandric numbers ,    @xmath34 , \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> this corresponds to the case where there are only analytic corrections - to - scaling terms . </S>",
    "<S> the leading amplitudes @xmath36 are of special interest , and for closed , open and semi - meanders we found the values 0.339(1 ) , 11.45(3 ) , and 0.688(1 ) , respectively . </S>"
