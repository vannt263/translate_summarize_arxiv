    "the importance of the study of top quark physics at the current stage in particle physics can hardly be overemphasized .",
    "apart from its crucial role in the test of the standard model ( sm ) at the loop level , the closeness of the top mass to the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) scale accord it a special role in virtually any alternative to the higgs mechanism .",
    "thus , the production of top quarks at the colliders can be a * low * energy probe of the * high * scale physics that might be triggering the ewsb . already at the tevatron , this is a topic of much attention  @xcite and a top factory such as the lhc would provide valuable information on the smas well as physics beyond it  @xcite .    in our work",
    "@xcite , we revisit the issue of strongly interacting spin one gauge bosons and their contribution to @xmath0 production at hadronic colliders .",
    "we consider two classes of models : 1 ) flavour universal colorons which are present in theories of extended color gauge theories and 2 ) axigluons which exist in theories of chiral colour .",
    "although neither of these have preferentially larger couplings to the @xmath0 pair , unlike kaluza klein gluons  @xcite or extended technicolour models , we demonstrate that even the current data on @xmath3 production yield very competitive constraints on the masses and coupling of these gauge bosons .",
    "arising in unifiable models of chiral colour  @xcite , axigluons are massive , strongly interacting gauge bosons with an axial vector coupling @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are the usual gell - mann matrices . in the simplest models , a high scale strong interaction gauge group of @xmath6",
    "is broken to the familiar @xmath7 , resulting in massive states with the aforementioned coupling .",
    "this carries through for all generalisations of chiral color .",
    "embedding this in a unified group implies @xmath8 gev and hence was searched for very actively at the tevatron .",
    "flavour universal colorons  @xcite arise in models with an extended colour gauge group .",
    "the latter were part of the general effort to understand the mechanism of ew symmetry breaking and the large mass of the top in the same framework .",
    "with a top quark condensate enhancing @xmath9 as well as driving ewsb , specific examples of this idea are topcolor  @xcite and topcolor assisted technicolor  @xcite .",
    "the colour group at the high scale is @xmath10both being vector - like which then breaks to @xmath11 giving rise to the massive ` colorons ' .",
    "variants of the model essentially differ in the way generations couple to the colorons .",
    "the one we consider is the simplest and is characeterised by a universal coupling ( @xmath12 ) to _ all _ the quarks .",
    "these models can be be grafted into a single higgs doublet model and has a * naturally * heavy top .",
    "understandably , ew precision measurements restrict the model in the mass - coupling ( @xmath13@xmath14 ) plane .",
    "the broad , strongly interacting axigluon and coloron resonances , @xmath15 , can be copiously produced at a hadronic collider and thus could show up as an additional , resonant contribution to the dijet production cross - section ( @xmath16 ) . at the tevatron , the dominance of the @xmath17 flux implies that these contributions can be quite large . at the time of writing the paper  @xcite , the best available limits on the axigluon and coloron masses came from the dijet sample  @xcite which rules out an axigluon of mass less than @xmath18 gev .",
    "the same limit is quoted for coloron for @xmath19 for the flavour universal case . in the approximation of neglecting the width and interference with background ,",
    "the limit on coloron masses can get only stricter with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "note , though , that the axigluon and coloron cases differ in a crucial manner : while the @xmath20-channel coloron exchange amplitude can interfere with a similar qcd amplitude ( for simplicity , let us consider @xmath21 ) , this is nonexistent for the axigluon . for small masses , the resonance is narrow ; with the difference being negligible , the limits for axigluon and coloron with @xmath19 would be nearly identical .",
    "however , as we will see shortly , the approximation may not be justified for higher mass resonances and it would be interesting to examine how the limits obtained from dijet analysis are affected .    in this work , we are interested in @xmath0 production . at the tree level ,",
    "the presence of either @xmath22 or @xmath23 can affect @xmath0 production only as far as the @xmath24-initiated subprocess is concerned , leaving the @xmath25-initiated subprocess unaltered .",

    "furthermore , the partial widths into a top - pair are different even for @xmath32 .",
    "the large widths imply that the ( narrow - width ) approximation of resonant production and subsequent decay is no longer a good one .",
    "this is borne out by fig.[widths_cs : f1]@xmath33 , wherein we compare the narrow - width contribution to @xmath0 production , viz . @xmath34 with the exact result , namely @xmath35 .",
    "the effect is indeed substantial . for the dijet case",
    "the effect will be smaller , but may still be non - negligible and hence might affect the limits on axigluon / coloron masses obtained from the dijet data .",
    "further , it is to be noted that the axial coupling of the @xmath22 gives rise to a forward - backward asymmetry for the @xmath36 quark  @xcite . for colorons , of course ,",
    "no such asymmetry can exist .    in figure  [ widths_cs : f1]@xmath37 , the results of the @xmath0 cross - sections expected fot the coloron / axigluons at the tevatron are shown as a function of the mass of the boson and for different values of @xmath14 .",
    "a few facts are to be noted .    * for axigluon case due to the different parity of the sm amplitude and the axigluon amplitude",
    ", the interference term does not contribute to the total rate .",
    "+ * for coloron the intereference term contributes and also changes sign as @xmath17 subprocess energy passes through @xmath13 , depending on @xmath14 .",
    "+ * for masses of massive gluon above @xmath38 not just the inteference term but the squared contribution of the new amplitude are different for coloron and axigluon .    the data indicated by the horizontal lines in figure  [ widths_cs : f1]@xmath37 and taken from  @xcite corresponds to : @xmath39 using these , we get for the axigluon @xmath40 gev at @xmath41 c.l . , whereas for the coloron , for @xmath19 , @xmath42 * and * @xmath43 are allowed at the same c.l .",
    "these limits are quite competitive with those available from the dijet analysis and are in fact different for the coloron and the axigluon even for @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , the coloron mass limits depend on @xmath14 non - monotonically ( a consequence of the interference term ) , as is evident in both figs .",

    "@xmath44 plane using the @xmath0 data at tevatron  @xcite .",

    "note that the consistency of certain regions in the paramter space with the data can not be interpreted as evidence for the colorons as the same data are consistent with the sm  as well .",
    "the parity violating axigluon coupling would also lead to a forward - backward asymmetry at the tevatron as shown in figure  [ exclusion : f3]@xmath37 .",
    "two things are to be noted here .",
    "our calculation corrects a mistake in ref .",
    "secondly for the masses accessible at the tevatron these are quite sizable and substantially larger than the the one expected due to qcd radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "this agrees with the detailed comparisons of the latter with those expected for axigluon contribution performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which appeared soon after our work .",
    "in fact the asymmetry caused by the axigluon resonance will have a different dependence on the phase space variabels from those caused by qcd effects . with this",
    ", one could in fact use these asymmetries ( or absence thereof ) to obtain constraints on the axigluons .",
    "with the tevatron pushing the limits on the axigluon and coloron masses higher , it is natural to investigate the prospects at the lhc . as gluon fluxes would dominate over @xmath17 , it is imperative to look at differential distributions , in particular that in the invariant mass of the @xmath0 pair .",
    "we see from the right panel of figure[asymmetrylhc : f4 ] that , for the first peak , assuming even only a @xmath48 efficiency , there will be about @xmath49 events with @xmath50 fb@xmath51 and thus a good chance of being able to see them at the lhc . for such masses , the effect of @xmath9 on the decay width is negligible and , for @xmath19 , the differential cross sections are virtually the same at the resonance .",
    "spectrum at the lhc in presence of either axigluons or colorons of a specified mass , along with the sm expectations.[asymmetrylhc : f4 ] ]    unfortunately , lhc being a @xmath52 machine , no fb asymmetry can be constructed for the axigluon case . however , the correlation between helicities of @xmath36 and @xmath53 carry the information on the heavy gluon contribution .",

    "these are , in essence , like the spin - spin correlation measurements which have been suggested for the study of @xmath57/spin properties of a resonance which can decay into a @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "in fact , this can then provide an additional handle to distinguish between the two cases at hand .     as a function of the boson mass .",
    "the two panels correspond to different values of @xmath58 .[lrasym : f5 ] ]",
    "in conclusion , constraints on the axigluons and colorons obtained from @xmath0 production at the tevatron are indeed competetive with those from dijets .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry at the tevatron can help constrain the axigluon further .",
    "nature of interference term with the sm amplitude are different for axigluon and coloron cases .",
    "the limits obtained from @xmath0 production on coloron masses depend on @xmath14 non monotonically . the zero width approximation too crude at larger masses and mass limits obtained for dijets for coloron",
