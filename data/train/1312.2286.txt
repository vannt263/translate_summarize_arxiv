    "<S> hopfield and ninio @xcite proposed a non - equilibrium `` kinetic proofreading '' mechanism which enhances the effect of the binding energy difference on reaction rates . as a result , reactions with the weakly binding substrate are suppressed to a much larger extent than one would expect at equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> kinetic proofreading has been evoked to explain very low error rates in a host of biochemical reactions despite the similarity of competing substrates ; in dna replication despite the similarity of the four nucleic acids , in protein synthesis despite the similarity of t - rna molecules @xcite , in immune response that discriminates between native and foreign proteins @xcite and in many other biological phenomena @xcite . in all of these cases , proofreading enhances discrimination between competing substrates by making the occupancy of a biochemical state more sensitive to changes in its energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the central proposition of our paper is that non - equilibrium systems like proofreading mechanisms can be designed to have co - existing regimes of varying discrimination . in the context of proofreading , </S>",
    "<S> some undesirable substrates can be highly discriminated against while other substrates of even weaker binding energy can actually be promoted . </S>",
    "<S> the number and properties of such co - existing discriminatory regimes are constrained by the topology of the network of paths connecting the system s states . within these constraints </S>",
    "<S> , we can design variable discrimination through an appropriate choice of kinetic parameters that might be `` hardwired '' , for example , in the structural and dynamical properties of molecules .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> non - equilibrium steady states are always powered by external sources of free energy , such as atp hydrolysis in the case of proofreading . </S>",
    "<S> we find that merely changing the chemical potential of these external sources can change the discrimination characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to tune such characteristics on the fly , without having to change any hardwired properties , raises interesting ways in which natural and synthetic systems can respond to the environment . </S>"
