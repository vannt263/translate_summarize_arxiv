    "the light - matter interaction has been subject of central interest since the early years of quantum mechanics . in @xmath0 , one of the first attempts to explain the results coming from experiments was the rabi model , that describes the simplest dipole semiclassical interaction between light and matter  @xcite , and is reduced to a pseudospin-@xmath1 system driven by a monochromatic classical radiation field .",
    "however , the advent of quantum technologies such as cavity qed  @xcite , have allowed us to access the quantum regime of the radiation field , where the dynamical description is given by the celebrated jaynes - cummings model ( jcm )  @xcite .",
    "this model predicts collapses and revivals of the population inversion , the appearance of jaynes - cummings doublets as a consequence of the excitation number conservation , and it has found a testbed in several hybrid setups such as trapped ions  @xcite , quantum dots  @xcite , and circuit quantum electrodynamics ( circuit qed )  @xcite .",
    "circuit qed has been growing both theoretically and experimentally , and their complex proposals such as the generation of multipartite entanglement  @xcite rely on the fundamentals of the jcm and the tavis - cummings model  @xcite .",
    "this can be justified because ratios between the coupling strength @xmath2 and the resonator frequency @xmath3 may grow from typical quantum optical values of @xmath4 to circuit qed values of @xmath5 .",
    "note that , in the latter , the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) can still be applied .",
    "nowadays , two key experiments with superconducting circuits  @xcite have made a significant improvement in the coupling strength , reaching values @xmath6 in the so - called ultrastrong coupling ( usc ) regime  @xcite . in this case , the rwa is not longer valid and all dynamical and statical properties have to be explained through the quantum rabi model ( qrm ) h_r=_z + a + g_x(a+ ) , [ hamr ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are pauli matrices , @xmath9 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator , @xmath10 is half of the qubit energy , @xmath3 is the resonator frequency , and @xmath2 stands for the coupling strength .",
    "in addition , a recent proposal considers the case where the coupling strength @xmath2 becomes comparable or larger than the mode frequency @xmath3 , @xmath11 , which is called deep strong coupling ( dsc ) regime  @xcite . in this case , the dynamics can be intuitively explained as photon number wavepackets propagating along a defined parity chain .",
    "although the state - of - the - art in circuit qed does not provide this coupling strength yet , the main features of the dsc regime have been observed in an analog quantum simulation  @xcite .",
    "the qrm described by the hamiltonian  ( [ hamr ] ) , has substantial differences as compared to the jcm , in fact only recently the properties of the qrm have been completely understood  @xcite . in the qrm",
    ", a discrete @xmath12-symmetry replaces the continuous @xmath13-symmetry of the jcm .",
    "therefore the excitation number is no longer a conserved quantity and the hilbert space splits into two infinite - dimensional invariant subspaces , the parity chains  @xcite .",
    "each eigenstate can be labeled with a @xmath12-quantum number , the parity @xmath14 , taking values @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to give analytical expressions for these eigenstates as elements of the bargmann space  @xcite , that allows the well - defined computation of their norms and overlaps with eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator , without truncation of the hilbert space  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to present a new insight of the quantum rabi model by stressing the use of dynamical correlation functions coming from the analytical solution obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this manner , we are able to explain relevant features such as the validity of the rwa in two well - defined regions , ranging from the jc regime to higher - coupling regimes of the quantum rabi model . in addition , as the coupling strength @xmath2 enters into the dsc regime , we find that the true eigenstates of the system can be well approximated by the shifted oscillator basis in each invariant parity chain without the need for a more complicated basis .",
    "this fact is supported by the calculation of the wigner function of the eigenstates , whose unexpected fidelity can be understood in terms of the analytical form of the eigenfunctions  @xcite , resembling closely to fock states . in this context",
    ", we also find stationary schrdinger cat - like states in the dsc regime .",
    "finally , we present our concluding remarks .",

    ", respectively .",
    "the first region comprises the jc regime , where the rwa holds , together with the perturbative usc regime , where small deviations from the jc occur ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the second identified region comprises a jump towards the higher - coupling regime , @xmath17 , and forms a precursor of the dsc regime ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the intermediate region , that is for @xmath19 , determines a kind of _ dark zone _ where no intuitive physics has been identified up to now .",
    "we begin by studying a suitable dynamical observable , the time average photon number |n_0 = _ t_0^tt",
    "n_0(t ) , [ time - av ] which measures the break of the @xmath13-symmetry in the jcm .",

    "<S> in particular , through time - dependent correlation functions , we give a quantitative criterion for classifying two regions of the quantum rabi model , involving the jaynes - cummings , the ultrastrong , and deep strong coupling regimes . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find a stationary qubit - field entangled basis that governs the whole dynamics as the coupling strength overcomes the mode frequency . </S>"
