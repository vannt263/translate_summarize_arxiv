    "deep inelastic scattering in nuclei has been a subject of intense study in the past years , which was stimulated by the discovery of the emc effect @xcite .",
    "different reviews on the subject have incorporated the advances on the experimental and theoretical sides @xcite . with ups and downs",
    "several conventional effects have remained as important ingredients explaining the basic features of the experiment : pionic effects for the enhancement of the ratio of the @xmath10 nuclear structure function to the one of the deuteron @xcite around @xmath11 , binding effects for the depletion of that ratio around @xmath12 @xcite and fermi motion for the increase of the ratio for @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "relativistic effects were also shown to be relevant @xcite and the use of spectral functions was advocated in refs .",
    "@xcite as an important tool to accurately account for fermi motion and binding effects .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "a theoretical framework was developed which accounts very accurately for all these effects .",
    "it uses a relativistic formalism from the beginning and follows a feynman diagrammatic many body scheme , where all the input from the nucleons or pions is incorporated via their respective propagators in the nuclear medium .",
    "the cloud from @xmath14-mesons was also found relevant in @xcite and helped improve the agreement with experiment . the scheme provided a good reproduction of the emc data for different nuclei outside the shadowing region which was not explored .    on the other hand",
    ", interest has been growing in the region of @xmath9 .",
    "this region , inaccessible for free nucleons , clearly indicates nuclear effects and the fermi motion is certainly the first candidate @xcite . in these latter works",
    "it was noted that a nonvanishing value of the nuclear structure functions at @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 the fermi momentum ) would indicate the presence of momentum components beyond the fermi momentum and this is actually the case experimentally .",
    "the high momentum components of the nucleus are generated by the nuclear correlations .",
    "for this reason the importance of these correlations in generating the structure function at large values of @xmath4 has been emphasized repeatedly @xcite , although the relevant information on the spectral functions was not readily available at that time @xcite .",
    "however , it is very dangerous to try to relate physical quantities to the occupation number , @xmath17 , since the high momentum components are strongly correlated with the energy of the nucleon and in physical processes one has conservation of fourmomentum .",
    "the importance of using the nucleon spectral function , @xmath18 , which provides the probability of finding a nucleon with a certain energy @xmath19 and a momentum @xmath20 , was pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a thorough study of the region of deep inelastic scattering for was done for several nuclei .",
    "several spectral functions were used .",
    "one of them @xcite was calculated for infinite nuclear matter using a microscopic brueckner - hartree - fock scheme and the @xmath21 interaction from realistic obe potentials @xcite .",
    "a second one was calculated semiphenomenologically @xcite , evaluating the nucleon selfenergy diagrams in a nuclear medium but using input from @xmath21 experimental cross sections and the polarization of the @xmath21 interaction in the medium to circumvent the use of the nucleon - nucleon potential and the ladder sums . in both cases",
    "the local density approximation was used to evaluate the structure functions for finite nuclei .",
    "another approach used a spectral function for finite nuclei @xcite for the case of @xmath22o . an interesting result from ref .",
    "@xcite is that the results with the local density approximation and those of the finite nuclei differ by less than @xmath23 in the region of the emc effect and at values of @xmath24 or bigger the differences are also less than @xmath25 .",
    "the differences between the results with the two spectral functions of nuclear matter are of the same order of magnitude or smaller than those quoted above .",
    "this gives us confidence to rely upon the method in order to explore the @xmath9 region where the information provided by the spectral function is essential .",
    "indeed , it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that usual approximations , like the use of the non interacting fermi sea , or the use of the momentum distribution @xmath17 provided by the same spectral function , but taking @xmath26 ( the free nucleon energy ) , or even an average energy @xmath27 weighted by the spectral function , gave rise to results which differed by two or three orders of magnitude from the accurate calculation and the experiment .",
    "the realistic calculation using the spectral functions was compared with the only experiment at @xmath9 in the deep inelastic region @xcite and the results agree within @xmath28 .",
    "the data of ref .",
    "@xcite explore only the region of @xmath29 , and beyond 1.16 the data are only upper bounds .",
    "it was also found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the region of @xmath30 was only sensitive to the high momentum and binding components provided by the nuclear correlations and that the shell model part of the nuclear spectral function gave a negligible contribution in that region .",
    "it is thus clear that more data in the @xmath9 region are necessary to further study these interesting dynamical properties of nuclei beyond the simple shell model picture @xcite .",
    "this is the same conclusion raised in ref .",
    "@xcite , which states that high @xmath5 data at high @xmath4 should be a top priority .    on the other hand ,",
    "many more data at lower values of @xmath5 exist , mostly measured at slac @xcite , which could shed light on the same nuclear issues , and others are planned at tjnaf @xcite .",
    "however , it was soon noticed that these data have a large contamination of quasielastic contribution where one nucleon of the nucleus is knocked out but there is no particle production from this individual nucleon @xcite .",
    "the presence of this quasielastic background helped interpret the  accidental \" @xmath31 scaling observed in these reactions @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite three different regions are differentiated : the quasielastic , the inelastic and the deep inelastic regions .",
    "the first one corresponds to one nucleon removal , the second one to the excitation of low lying resonances which decay by pion emission and the third one to deep inelastic where more particles are produced . as quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite these three regions are never completely separated although one can find the dominance of some of these channels in different regions .",
    "the investigations of ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that the region of @xmath9 and @xmath32 gev@xmath3 is dominated by the quasielastic process and that @xmath33 gev@xmath3 is a safe region where the deep inelastic process would dominate at @xmath34 .    the work of refs .",
    "@xcite improves over the method used in refs .",
    "@xcite in the use of a relativistic framework which makes unnecessary the flux factor proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and used in refs .",
    "@xcite in order to introduce relativistic effects in the nonrelativistic calculations .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the latter procedure led to different numerical results than the consistent relativistic calculation . in addition , the work of ref .",
    "@xcite included the contribution from the modification of the meson cloud in the medium , however , this feature is irrelevant in the @xmath9 region since the mesonic effects become negligible beyond @xmath35 .    with the advent of future experiments at intermediate energy machines like tjnaf , or possible ones in proposed facilities like elfe , it becomes important to make an exploration of that region in order to assess the dominance of the different processes at different @xmath5 and @xmath4 and the characteristics of the different processes .",

    "the quasielastic contribution is dominant in all the range of the figure and peaks around @xmath81 ( for on shell nucleons at rest we would have a @xmath89 function ) .",
    "the spread of the quasielastic contribution is due to fermi motion and binding .",
    "the inelastic plus deep inelastic contribution is small ( we will call it inelastic for simplicity in what follows ) in all the range of the figure compared to the quasielastic contribution . however , at values of @xmath90 the inelastic contribution becomes more relevant .",
    "in fact one can see in the figure that at @xmath91 the inelastic contribution is about 70 @xmath92 of the quasielastic one , and its inclusion is necessary to obtain a good agreement with the data in that region . for values of @xmath93 the strength of the structure function",
    "is completely dominated by the quasielastic contribution .",
    "the agreement with experiment is rather good up to values of @xmath94 and from there on our results start diverging from the data .    the region of @xmath95 in the figure can be filled up by excitation of @xmath96 components , either by renormalizing the final nucleon propagator ( we have taken a free propagator for the ejected nucleon ) or incorporating meson exchange currents ( mec ) into the approach .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath96 excitation is favoured in the @xmath95 with respect to the @xmath97 excitation . indeed , by splitting the fourmomentum @xmath98 into two equal halves with @xmath99 for each @xmath100 excitation as an average",
    ", we see that this latter combination is kinematically much more suited than the excitation of a @xmath100 component with @xmath98 .",
    "the contribution of these @xmath101 components has been the subject of intense investigation at lower electron energies @xcite .",
    "it is a genuine many body contribution which is not accounted for by the inelastic contribution and hence is additional to the quasielastic and inelastic channels studied here ( the final nucleon renormalization actually redistributes the strength and is not an additive channel , contrary to the case of the mec )",
    ".    we will not discuss further this subject since our purpose here is to make a comparison of the quasielastic with the inelastic contribution as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath4 to establish the regions where the inelastic contributions dominate in the cross sections .    in fig .",
    "4 we find similar features to those discussed above except that we see that the contribution of the inelastic channels is relatively more important than in the former case . indeed , at @xmath102 the quasielastic and inelastic contributions are about the same",
    ". once again we can see that the inelastic contribution is essential to describe quantitatively the data below @xmath81 and at @xmath103 the inelastic contribution dominates the structure function .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the results for the recent experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite taken at higher electron energies and @xmath5 . at this value of @xmath5",
    "we see that the quasielastic and inelastic contributions are similar around @xmath104 but at higher and lower values of @xmath4 the inelastic contribution is larger , particularly at @xmath105 where it becomes clearly dominant .",
    "we can see from all these figures that the agreement of our results with the data in the regions of dominance of the inelastic or quasielastic channels is rather good and we then extrapolate the results to make predictions for values of @xmath5 still unexplored .",
    "one interesting finding of ref .",
    "@xcite is the sensitivity to the nuclear spectral function @xmath106 of the results for the structure functions @xmath67 at @xmath9 and @xmath5 large , and how some common approximations made in the study of the emc effect badly fail at values of @xmath107 .",
    "here we want to carry out a similar test for the quasielastic channel and for the inelastic one at these lower values of @xmath5 .    in fig .",
    "6 we show the results of the quasielastic channel calculated with the spectral function and with two approximations :    \\1 ) non interacting fermi sea , for which the spectral function can be written as @xcite    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the occupation number of a non interacting fermi sea of local density @xmath110 .",

    "( [ eq:17 ] ) is a selfenergy which is chosen such as to provide the exact experimental binding energy of each particular nucleus @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) momentum distribution . in this case",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) , with a momentum distribution @xmath112 which is the actual momentum distribution in the nucleus given by    @xmath113    this approximation misses the correlations of the momenta with the energy and we shall call it uncorrelated momentum distribution .    in fig .",
    "6 we see that the use of the non interacting fermi distribution leads to similar results ( slightly bigger ) of the structure function around the peak of the distribution ( at @xmath81 ) than those using the spectral function .",
    "however , as @xmath4 increases , the results with the non interacting fermi sea fall faster than the other ones .    the spectral function accounts for larger momentum components than the non interacting fermi sea and this is the reason for the extended contributions at @xmath114 . we also show in the figure the results obtained by using the uncorrelated momentum distribution of eq .",
    "( [ eq:20 ] ) .",
    "we can see that this approximation fails to provide the main features of the quasielastic peak , which are well given by the non interacting fermi sea calculation or the one using the spectral function .",
    "we also observe that at @xmath115 the approximation gives rise to an important contribution which is not substantiated by the accurate calculation with the spectral function .",
    "this is due to the contribution of large momentum components which , however , are uncorrelated with similarly large binding energies , as the spectral function would give @xcite .    in fig .",
    "7 we see similar results but for the inelastic contribution corresponding to the data of fig .  5 .",
    "in this case the roles are reversed .",
    "we can see that the non interacting fermi sea gives results smaller than those with the spectral function at @xmath93 and the uncorrelated momentum distribution gives rise to results much bigger than those obtained with the spectral function at @xmath9 .",
    "the discrepancies are rather large , such that none of these approximations can be advocated as a fair substitute of the use of the full spectral function .",
    "particularly , the results obtained with the momentum distribution are rather bad in both channels , the quasielastic and the inelastic .    another way of expressing these ideas is to say that the inelastic contribution at @xmath9 is rather sensitive to the nuclear spectral function and carries information on this magnitude , particularly , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , about the `` background '' contribution which is tied to the dynamical features of the nucleus .",
    "now we proceed to extrapolate the results at higher @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "8 we show the results for the quasielastic and inelastic contributions at @xmath81 as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "we use three different parametrizations of the nucleon structure function , one of them which we have used so far @xcite , and which is indicated for relatively low @xmath5 and other two , @xcite ( mrs ) and @xcite ( cteq ) , which are more suited for large @xmath5 values in the bjorken scaling region .",
    "the figure is significative because we see that the results obtained for the inelastic contribution are very sensitive to the parametrization used for the nucleon structure function . at @xmath116",
    "gev@xmath3 the results obtained with different nucleon structure functions differ by about a factor 5 .",
    "however , at values of @xmath117 gev@xmath3 the differences are about a factor 50 .",
    "a discussion of the assumptions made in these structure functions and their range of validity is hence in order .",
    "the structure function from cteq which we use is meant to be used at large @xmath5 in the bjorken scaling region , since we do not implement @xmath5 corrections important at small @xmath5 .",
    "the structure function of mrs is meant to work at high values of @xmath5 and also at low values and hence , in principle , should cover the range of @xmath5 in fig .",
    "however , data at small @xmath5 and large @xmath4 are not included in the fit of mrs .",
    "indeed , the largest @xmath4 considered is @xmath118 and the data for this value of @xmath4 go down to @xmath119 gev@xmath3 only .    on the other hand , the parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite is precisely meant for low values of @xmath5 and it contains the contribution from excitation of resonances ( the so called inelastic part ) plus a background of deep inelastic .",
    "this parametrization is done with precission , observing also the thresholds .",
    "for instance @xmath120 vanishes before @xmath81 as it should be : indeed , we have    @xmath121    since we need to create at least a pion in the inelastic contribution .",
    "hence , in the limit @xmath122 , we have @xmath123 and the limit of @xmath81 can be approached as much as one wishes .",
    "however , for @xmath5 of the order of a few gev@xmath3 there is a cut off at values of @xmath90 , for example at @xmath124 gev@xmath3 , we have @xmath125 .",
    "the parametrization of @xcite has a structure function vanishing in the forbidden region , while the one of mrs provides a smooth function of @xmath4 which reaches the limit @xmath81 for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "since the nuclear structure function @xmath67 calculated at @xmath9 picks up its contribution from @xmath126 for values of @xmath65 close to 1 , it is then clear that the structure function of mrs should not be used for such purposes for low values of @xmath5 . instead",
    ", the nucleon structure function of @xcite should be used in this case .",
    "but the latter one should not be used at large values of @xmath5 .",
    "a compromise region can be @xmath127 gev@xmath3 below which the @xcite results should be taken and beyond which the mrs should be used .",
    "the problems with the mrs and cteq parametrizations to describe the large @xmath4 region can be further exposed in figs .",
    "9 , 10 , 11 .    in fig .",
    "9 we show the results for @xmath67 at @xmath91 with the three parametrizations .",
    "we see now a better agreement between the mrs and @xcite parametrizations in the region of 3 gev@xmath128 gev@xmath3 . below @xmath129 gev@xmath3",
    "we see again that the mrs gives a sharp increase with respect to @xcite which again must be attributed to the artificial large @xmath4 dependence of @xmath126 . at values of @xmath8 gev@xmath3",
    "the cteq and mrs parametrizations start converging .    the discrepancies between the results of @xmath67 , calculated with the different nucleon structure functions at @xmath81 in fig .",
    "8 , become even worse at higher values of @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "10 we show the results at @xmath130 . discarding the results obtained with the cteq parametrization in that region",
    ", we still see that there are large discrepancies between the mrs and @xcite results with a gap in the region of @xmath131 67 gev@xmath3 which should in principle be the dividing region for the two results .",
    "it is difficult to draw firm conclusions in the region of 4 gev@xmath132 gev@xmath3 , but we can safely claim that at values of @xmath6 gev@xmath3 the quasielastic contribution dominates the nuclear structure function , while at @xmath8 gev@xmath3 the inelastic part dominates .",
    "the situation becomes even worse at @xmath133 ( not shown here ) .",
    "once again it is difficult to make up one s mind in the intermediate region of @xmath5 , but in any case one could conclude rather safely the dominance of the inelastic channel at @xmath134 gev@xmath3 and of the quasielastic one at @xmath32 gev@xmath3 .",
    "these results agree with those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is clear that going to values of @xmath95 would make the results even more sensitive to the parametrization of @xmath126 , thus increasing more the intrinsic uncertainties of the nuclear structure function and not allowing the extraction of useful nuclear information .",
    "there is , however , good news if one goes to high values of @xmath5 in the bjorken region . indeed , as we show in fig .  11 , at @xmath135 gev@xmath3 the nuclear structure function @xmath67 is all due to the inelastic contributions and the results obtained with different parametrizations agree",
    "remarkably among themselves , which gives us great confidence in the results . we have carried out the calculations using three parametrizations : the mrs , the one of cteq and the one of duke and owens @xcite .",
    "the differences are of the order of 10@xmath92 or less .",
    "we also show in the figure the experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite the results agree with the data within 30@xmath92 in the range of @xmath136 . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite the results of @xmath67 at @xmath93 are essentially due to the `` background '' part of the nuclear spectral function , with a negligible contribution of the bound states of the shell model .",
    "the structure function hence contains a very rich information on `` nuclear correlations '' in the generalized sense of nuclear structure beyond the mean field approximation .    coming back to our discussion about the accuracy of the different nucleon structure functions to provide @xmath67 at @xmath93 we show in fig .",
    "12 the results obtained for @xmath137 gev@xmath3 ( at @xmath81 ) with the mrs structure function .",
    "we can see that the addition of the inelastic contribution to the quasielastic one leads to poor agreement with the data .",
    "this confirms our previous statements that at low @xmath5 the mrs should give an overestimate of @xmath67 because it does not respect the thesholds in @xmath4 .    on the other hand , in fig",
    "13 we show the results calculated with the mrs structure function at @xmath88 gev@xmath3 ( at @xmath81 ) .",
    "the agreement with the data in this case is of the same quality as with the stein structure function @xcite , slightly better at high values of @xmath4 and slightly worse at smaller @xmath4 .",
    "this figure substantiates our statement that @xmath127 gev@xmath3 is the dividing line for the validity of the two parametrizations and values of @xmath4 around 1 or below . at larger values of @xmath4 we saw , however , that in that region there are discrepancies between the results with the two structure functions .",
    "another message of our results is that if one wants to extract useful nuclear information at values of @xmath138 from the intermediate @xmath5 region ( 3 gev@xmath139 gev@xmath3 ) , a reliable nucleon structure function in the region of @xmath4 close to 1 is absolutely necessary .",
    "this call is important in view that this range is bound to be covered in future experiments at tjnaf .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results with those found in ref .",

    "@xcite . however , our discussion and the use of different nucleon structure functions served to show that at present there are large uncertainties in the intermediate @xmath5 region tied to the behaviour of the structure functions at @xmath4 close to 1 , which prevent us from drawing firm conclusions in that region .",
    "we have made a thorough study of the quasielastic and inelastic contributions to the nuclear structure functions in the region of @xmath140 and for values of @xmath5 ranging from 1- 20 gev@xmath3 .",
    "this is the region where both mechanisms compete and we have shown the regions in the @xmath141 variables where one or the other of the mechanisms dominates . as discussed in the former section , in some cases we reconfirm results obtained by other authors before , but there are a few novelties in the present work . with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite , where only deep inelastic scattering at high @xmath5 was studied , we study here the region of small and intermediate @xmath5 and include the quasielastic contribution which was negligible at high @xmath5 .",
    "this has allowed us to compare our theoretical predictions with many existing data , which had not been done before , and also has allowed us to make some prospects of what can be learned and what should then be measured in present facilities like tjnaf .    with respect to the similar work of refs .",
    "@xcite our results include relativistic corrections .",
    "furthermore , our study has shown that there is no precise information available on the nucleon structure functions around @xmath142 in order to make reliable predictions in the region of @xmath143 gev@xmath144 gev@xmath3 .",
    "we also give arguments which set clear limits to the region of validity of present parametrizations of the nucleon structure functions .",
    "on the other hand , even if we have different numerical results at @xmath145 than in @xcite , the `` safe '' conclusions obtained here ( taking into account the uncertainties ) about the regions of dominance of the quasielastic or deep inelastic contributions are the same .",
    "we describe now with some more details the main findings of the present work .    on general grounds",
    "we can say that at @xmath81 the quasielastic contribution dominates below @xmath32 gev@xmath3 while for @xmath146 gev@xmath3 the inelastic contribution is already an order of magnitude bigger than the quasielastic one .    for values of @xmath138 we found that in the region of 3 gev@xmath147 gev@xmath3 the results for the inelastic contribution obtained with different nucleon structure functions were very different .",
    "this does not allow one to draw strong conclusions from the data in that region .",
    "we also observed that at values of @xmath135 gev@xmath3 the results obtained for @xmath148 at @xmath9 with different nucleon structure functions were very stable .",
    "this fact , together with the sensitivity of these results to the region of large momenta and binding energies of the nuclear spectral function , makes the measurement of @xmath67 in that region an excellent tool to learn about dynamical aspects of the nucleus , beyond its approximate shell model structure .",
    "even with the uncertainties about the inelastic contribution in the intermediate @xmath5 region , we can make some relatively safe statements by claiming that for @xmath7 the inelastic contribution is dominant for @xmath134 gev@xmath3 while the quasielastic contribution is dominant for @xmath6 gev@xmath3 .",
    "these results confirm the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our determination of the quasielastic contribution is rather precise in the region of @xmath149 gev@xmath3 .",
    "this means that if experiments are done in that region , our results can be used to separate the inelastic contribution to the structure function from the data .",
    "these results would be useful to unravel the discrepancies between different models for @xmath126 at @xmath4 close to 1 .",
    "certainly , precise measurements of @xmath126 in that region would also be needed simultaneously if one wishes to asses the validity of the many body methods used here .",
    "taking into account that this range of @xmath5 is the one likely to be investigated at tjnaf , both types of experiments are called for .    with respect to the reliability of the method used ,",
    "there are two regions where our predictions for the inelastic contribution are safe : the region of @xmath150 gev@xmath3 where the parametrization for @xmath126 of @xcite used here is rather reliable , and the one in the deep inelastic region at @xmath151 gev@xmath3 where the results obtained are rather stable , quite independent of the parametrization used .    at large @xmath5",
    "the agreement of our results with the only existing data is fair . at low values of @xmath5",
    "the agreement of our results with the data is rather good and by changing the range of @xmath5 and @xmath4 we change the strength of the inelastic and quasielastic contributions , obtaining in all cases a good agreement with the data ( at @xmath152 gev@xmath3 ) .",
    "this gives us some confidence in our method to describe both the quasielastic and inelastic contributions in those regions .",
    "another interesting information which one could get experimentally is the separation between the quasielastic contribution and the inelastic one . here , however , we must give an anticipated warning about how the comparison should be made . in the evaluation of the quasielastic contribution we did not look at final state interaction ( fsi ) .",
    "this is fine is one wishes to obtain the contribution from this channel to the @xmath67 structure function , which sums the contributions of all possible final states . in practice",
    ", the strength of the quasielastic channel evaluated by us would be redistributed in other channels due to final state interaction of the emerging nucleon with the nucleus , and hence some events which were quasielastic originally will become inelastic ones in the nucleus due to fsi .",
    "this is in complete analogy with the process of photon absortion in nuclei , which can proceed either through direct photon absorption by pairs ( or trios ) of nucleons or indirectly via pion production and pion reabsorption in the nucleus @xcite . in this case ,",
    "events which were pion production originally become nuclear absorption events , but the important thing is that the inclusive cross section can be calculated by looking only at the first step processes . the fsi does not change the cross sections obtained in that way , it simply redistributes the strength in other channels .",
    "certainly , one of the possible measurements would be one nucleon emission and the rest of the nucleus in its ground state .",
    "this is not a trivial measurement since it requires a good energy resolution to guarantee that the final nucleus is not further excited .",
    "provided this experiment is done , the comparison of our results with this data would require the use of distorted waves for the emitted nucleon , instead of the implicit plane wave calculation which we have done . on the other hand , if what one wishes is to separate the inelastic contribution to be compared with ordinary evaluations of the deep inelastic nuclear structure function , what one must subtract from the data is not this experimental one ( and only one ) nucleon removal contribution , but the quasielastic scattering contribution evaluated by us , corresponding to the first step quasielastic scattering on one nucleon .",
    "summarizing our thoughts on future perspectives : the measurements at @xmath9 in the high @xmath5 region , @xmath153 gev@xmath3 should be encouraged .",
    "they offer a clean measure of the deep inelastic contribution and they provide direct information on the dynamical aspects of the nucleus , loosely speaking , about nuclear correlations",
    ". certainly other theoretical calculations should be most welcome .",
    "the region of low @xmath5 , @xmath150 gev@xmath3 and @xmath105 seems to be rather well under control theoretically but there the quasielastic contribution is large .",
    "the quasielastic contribution at low values of @xmath5 is only sensitive to nuclear correlations for @xmath95 where other contributions would be important , hence it can not be considered an important source of information on the dynamical aspects of the nucleus .",
    "conversely , the inelastic and deep inelastic contributions , even at intermediate values of @xmath5 carry this relevant information",
    ". the existence of experimental facilities where this region of @xmath5 will be explored can rend this information easily accessible .",
    "however , for the purpose of capitalizing the information contained in these data , the measurement of nuclear structure functions at @xmath154 in that region should be accompanied by precise measurements and accurate parametrizations of the nucleon structure function at @xmath4 close to 1 .",
