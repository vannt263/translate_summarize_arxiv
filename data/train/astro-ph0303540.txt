    "the stellar populations of galaxies carry a record of their star forming and chemical histories , from the epoch of formation to the present .",
    "the global properties of galaxies are determined by the nature and evolution of their stellar components .",
    "their studies thus provide a powerful tool to explore the physics of galaxy formation and evolution ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for local group galaxies and some very nearby galaxies that can be resolved into individual stars with hst and 10-m class telescopes ,",
    "the stellar population properties may be studied by means of direct observations . however , for objects at larger distances , individual stars ( except for some giants ) are unresolved , even with 10-m class telescopes .",
    "the integrated light of such galaxies is expected to contain valuable information about their physical properties .",
    "the most common approach used to interpret the integrated spectrophotometric properties of galaxies is _ stellar population synthesis_. there are two main types of population synthesis studies : evolutionary population synthesis and empirical population synthesis ( eps hereafter ) . both types of studies require a complete library of input ( observed or model atmosphere ) spectra of stars or star clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the evolutionary population synthesis approach , pioneered by tinsley ( 1967 ) ,",
    "the main adjustable parameters are the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , the star formation history and , in some cases , the rate of chemical enrichment .",
    "assumptions about the time evolution of these parameters allow one to compute the age - dependent distribution of stars in the hertzsprung - russell diagram , from which the integrated spectral evolution of the stellar population can be obtained . in recent years",
    ", a number of groups have developed evolutionary population synthesis models , which allow one to investigate the physical properties of observed galaxies ( @xcite ; arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; buzzoni 1989 ; bressan , chiosi & fagotto 1994 ; worthey 1994 ; weiss , peletier & matteucci 1995 ; fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ; mas - hesse & kunth 1999 ; moeller , fritze - v .",
    "alvensleben & fricke 1999 ; leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ; and bruzual & charlot 1993 , 2003 ) .",
    "such models are convenient tools for studying the spectral _ evolution _ of galaxies , as they allow one to predict the past and future spectral appearance of galaxies observed at any given time .",
    "however , modern evolutionary population synthesis models still suffer from serious limitations ( e.g. , charlot  1996 ) .",
    "the empirical population synthesis approach , also known as ` stellar population synthesis with a data base ' , was introduced by faber ( 1972 ) . in this technique ,",
    "one reproduces the integrated spectrum of a galaxy with a linear combination of spectra of individual stars or star clusters of various types taken from a comprehensive library .",
    "the empirical population synthesis approach has been employed successfully by several authors to interpret observed galaxy spectra ( faber 1972 ; oconnell 1976 ; pickles 1985 ; bica 1988 ; pelat 1998 ; boisson et al .",
    "2000 ; cid fernandes 2001 ) .",
    "an appealing property of this approach is that the results do not hinge on a priori assumptions about stellar evolution , the histories of star formation and chemical enrichment , nor  in the case of a library of individual stellar spectra  the imf .",
    "in return , it does not allow one to predict the past and future spectral appearance of galaxies . in 1996 , a workshop devoted to the comparison of various evolutionary population synthesis and empirical population synthesis codes showed broad agreement in general and a number of discrepancies in detail ( leitherer et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use the empirical population synthesis approach to constrain the stellar content and star formation histories of a sample of 73 blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) .",
    "our approach builds on earlier studies by bica ( 1988 ) and cid fernandes ( 2001 ) , and we adopt the library of observed star - cluster spectra assembled by bica & alloin ( 1986 ; see also bica 1988 ) .",
    "our primary goal is to illustrate the constraints that can obtained on the ages and metallicities of the stellar populations of bcgs that can not be resolved into individual stars , on the basis of their integrated spectra . in a forthcoming study",
    ", we will use the results of this analysis to model the spectral evolution of bcgs using evolutionary population synthesis models .",
    "another goal of the present work is to refine previous measurements of the balmer emission - line fluxes of the bcgs in our sample , through an accurate modeling of the underlying stellar absorption spectrum .",
    "this issue is critical to spectroscopic analyses of bcgs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly review the principle of the empirical population synthesis approach .",
    "we describe the properties of the bcg spectral sample in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we estimate the stellar components in bcgs by fitting the observed equivalent widths and continuum colors with the empirical population synthesis approach . in section 5",
    "we discuss the age - metallicity degeneracy and the possible application of our results .",
    "section 6 summarizes our main results .",
    "in a recent paper , cid fernandes ( 2001 ) revisit the classical problem of synthesizing the spectral properties of a galaxy by using a ` base ' of star - cluster spectra , approaching it from a probabilistic perspective .",
    "their work improves over previous eps studies at both the formal and computational levels , and it represents an efficient tool for probing the stellar population mixture of galaxies . to provide a quantitative description of the stellar components in the nuclear regions of bcgs",
    ", we will apply this eps method to our bcg sample .",
    "it is based on spectral - group templates built from star clusters of different ages and metallicities , and on bayes probabilistic theorem and the eps metropolis algorithm . in this section ,",
    "we first describe the star cluster base .",
    "we then briefly review bayes probabilistic formulation and the eps metropolis algorithm",
    ".      empirical population synthesis by with a data base ( a base of @xmath0 spectra of stars or star clusters ) is a classical tool designed to study the stellar population of galaxies .",
    "the recent eps algorithm of cid fernandes ( 2001 ; see also bica 1988 ) relies on a data base of star - cluster spectra rather than on one of individual stellar spectra .",
    "the star cluster base used by cid fernandes ( 2001 ) was introduced by schmidt ( 1991 ) .",
    "it consists of 12 population groups , spanning five age bins  10 gyr ( representing globular cluster - like populations ) , 1 gyr , 100 myr , 10 myr and ` hii'-type ( corresponding to current star formation )  and four metallicities  0.01 , 0.1 , 1 and 4 times z@xmath1 ( see table 1 of cid fernandes 2001 ) .",
    "all metallicities are not available for clusters of all ages .",
    "in particular , spectra of star clusters younger than 1 gyr are only available for the metallicities z@xmath1 and 4z@xmath1 .",
    "since blue compact galaxies are expected to have predominantly low abundances , the base of star - cluster spectra used by cid fernandes ( 2001 ) is not optimal for our analysis .",
    "the base of 35 star - cluster spectra used by bica ( 1988 ; see also bica & alloin 1986 ) is better appropriate for our purpose , as it contains spectra of young star clusters with metallicities down to @xmath2 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "each component , corresponding to a specific age and metallicity , is characterized by a set of six metallic features (  k  @xmath33933 , cn  @xmath34200 , g  band  @xmath34301 ,  @xmath35175 ,  @xmath38543 ,  @xmath38662 ) and three balmer lines ( , , and ) , as well as @xmath4  continuum fluxes at selected pivot wavelengths ( 3290 , 3660 , 4020 , 4510 , 6630 , 7520 and 8700  ) , which are normalized at @xmath35870  .",
    "the library contains an hii region component corresponding to current star formation .",
    "this is represented by a pure continuum based on the spectrum of 30 dor , which is used at all metallicities ( see the recent description by schmitt 1996 ) .",
    "table 1 lists the ages and metallicities of each of the 35 components of the bica ( 1988 ) base of star - cluster spectra .",
    "the top line lists the ages of the components , while the rightmost column lists the metallicities , with [ z / z@xmath1 ] = log(z / z@xmath1 ) .",
    ".ages ( in units of yr ) , metallicities and numbering convention for the star clusters in the base . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      the results of our analysis are summarized in tables 3 and 4 for the galaxies with asymptotic ( young - star ) metallicities [ z / z@xmath1]=0.5 and 0.0 , respectively . for each galaxy , we report the percentage contributions from each age - metallicity component to the integrated flux at @xmath6  .",
    "the first and second lines of each table indicate the metallicities and the ages of the different stellar components . for reference",
    ", the third line indicates the indices of the stellar components in the cluster data base of table 1 . for each galaxy",
    ", we also list the inferred @xmath7-band attenuation @xmath8 and the absorption equivalent widths of , ,  and , as measured from the synthetic stellar population spectra .",
    "figure [ eqw - syn - obs ] shows the equivalent widths ( @xmath9 ) of all the stellar absorption features used to constrain the fits in the model spectra against those in the observed spectra ( @xmath10 , for @xmath11  ) , for all 73 bcgs in our sample .",
    "clearly , the feature strengths in the model spectra are in very good agreement with those in the observed spectra .",
    "a first noticeable result in tables 3 and 4 is that all bcgs show an underlying component of stars older than @xmath12 .",
    "the fractional contribution of this component to the total light at @xmath35870   exceeds 15% for most galaxies , except for some low - luminosity bcgs , such as i zw 18 , ii zw 40 , which have very strong emission line spectra , and have a marginally detected old component .",
    "we note that the spectra used here sample the inner regions of the galaxies .",
    "the contribution from old and intermediate - age stars to the integrated light could be even larger in the extended ( off - nuclear ) regions of galaxies .",
    "the presence of significant populations of old and intermediate - age stars indicates that blue compact galaxies have experienced substantial episodes of star formation in the past .",
    "this supports the results from deep imaging observations of the color - magnitude diagrams of a few nearby bcgs that these are old galaxies ( see section 5.2 below ) .",
    "as expected , stars younger than @xmath13 tend to dominate the emission at 5870  , consistent with the observational character of bcgs , i.e. blue colors and strong emission lines .",
    "another interesting result of tables 3 and 4 is that blue compact galaxies present a variety of star formation histories . in ii zw 67 and i",
    "zw 56 , for example , stars with age 10 gyr contribute as much as 20 per cent of the flux at @xmath35870  .",
    "in contrast , in iii zw 43 and mrk 57 , old stars do not contribute significantly to the flux at @xmath35870  , that is produced in half by intermediate - age stars .",
    "the galaxies i zw 18 and ii zw 40 differ from these cases in that their emission at @xmath35870   is accounted almost entirely by young stars .",
    "the star formation history of bcgs , therefore , appears to vary significantly on a case by case basis .    for simplicity , in what follows",
    "we arrange stars into four age bins : * old * stars with age @xmath14 ( proportion ) ; * int*ermediate - age stars with ages between @xmath12 and @xmath15 ( proportion ) ; * y*oung * s*tars with ages between @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( proportion ) ; and newly - born stars in  regions ( proportion ) .",
    "hence + + + = 1 .",
    "figure [ fig - age ] illustrates graphically the variety of star formation histories reported in tables  3 and 4 for the 73 galaxies in our sample . in each panel",
    ", the horizontal axis represents , , , and  ( from left to right ) , while the vertical axis shows the percentage contributions at 5870  of stars in these four age bins .",
    "stars younger than @xmath17 dominate the emission in most bcgs , but the galaxies also contain substantial fractions of older stars .",
    "figure  [ fig - spec ] illustrates the results of the spectral fits obtained for four galaxies in our sample .",
    "also shown are the contributions to the integrated spectrum by stars in the four age groups defined in section 4.3 above ( the relative contributions by the different stellar components to the total flux at @xmath35870   are those listed in tables 3 and 4 for these galaxies ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - spec ] shows that the synthetic spectra ( * syn * ) inferred from our population synthesis analysis provide good fits to the observed spectra of bcgs ( * obs * ) .",
    "the absorption wings of ,  and  in the observed spectra are also well reproduced by the models ( the synthetic spectra do not include nebular emission lines ) .",
    "we find that , for some strong star - forming galaxies , the synthetic spectra do not provide very good fits to the observed continuum spectra at wavelengths between 4300 and 4800  .",
    "this may arise from the presence of wolf - rayet ( wr ) features , such as features at @xmath34511  4535 , @xmath34565 , @xmath34605 , 4620 , and @xmath34686 , in the observed spectra .",
    "we plan to investigate this small discrepancy using evolutionary population synthesis models in a future paper .",
    "the range of star formation histories inferred for the bgcs in our sample may be interpreted in terms of an evolutionary sequence . following cid fernandes ( 2001b ) ,",
    "we represent graphically the histories of star formation of the galaxies in figure [ fig - ed ] , in a plane with abscissa = +  and ordinate .",
    "also shown as dashed lines in the figure are lines of constant  ( + + = 1 ) .",
    "the main result from figure  [ fig - ed ] is that the 73 bcgs in our sample define a sequence in  and  over a relatively small range of .",
    "the range in  is slightly smaller for galaxies with asymptotic ( young - star ) metallicity [ z / z@xmath1]=0.5 ( stars ) than for those with asymptotic metallicity [ z / z@xmath1]= 0.0 ( squares ) .",
    "some galaxies with ` extreme ' stellar populations are labelled in fig .",
    "[ fig - ed ] . in i",
    "zw 56 and ii zw 67 , for example , old stars contribute up to @xmath18% of the integrated flux at @xmath35870 ( see section 4.3 above ) .",
    "the galaxy iii zw 43 is that where intermediate - age stars contribute the most to the optical continuum emission .",
    "in contrast , some galaxies , such as i zw 18 , ii zw 40 , appear to be almost ` pure starbursts ' .",
    "the small percentage of old and intermediate - age stars found here for these galaxies is consistent with the results from other recent studies , e.g. , smoker  ( 1999 ) , aloisi  ( 1999 ) ( see section 5.2 below ) .",
    "since the location of an individual galaxy in figure  [ fig - ed ] reflects the evolutionary state of its stellar population , we can interpret the _ distribution _ of galaxies in this diagram as an _",
    "evolutionary _ sequence .",
    "in particular , starbursting galaxies whose spectra are entirely dominated by young massive stars ( bottom right part of the diagram ) will presumably evolve toward larger /values ( top left part of the diagram ) over a timescale of a few @xmath19 , once their bursts have ceased .",
    "this interpretation is supported by several observational facts .",
    "first , metal absorption - line features become stronger and galaxy colors become progressively redder as one moves from large  to large  along the sequence .",
    "second , galaxies with large  ( such as i zw 56 , ii zw 67 ) have spectra typical of a `` post - starburst '' galaxies , with pronounced balmer absorption lines characteristic of a - type stars and with no strong emission lines .",
    "finally , most bcgs in which wr features have been detected are located in the large-  region of the diagram , consistent with the young burst ages implied by the presence of wr stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "accurate measurements of the h - balmer emission lines are crucial to constrain the attenuation by dust , the star formation rate , the gas - phase abundances of chemical elements and the excitation parameter in galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to measure with accuracy the balmer emission - line fluxes of bcgs , we must account for the contamination by underlying stellar absorption .",
    "different approaches have been used to correct balmer emission - line fluxes for underlying stellar absorption in bcgs .",
    "the simplest approach consists in adopting a constant equivalent width ( 1.52  ) for all the balmer absorption lines ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another standard correction consists in determining the absorption equivalent width through an iterative procedure , by assuming that the equivalent width is the same for all balmer lines and by requiring that the color excesses derived from / , / , and /  be consistent ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in reality",
    ", however , the absorption equivalent width may not be the same for all h - balmer lines .",
    "the advantage of the empirical population synthesis method used above to fit the observed spectra of bcgs is that it provides simultaneous fits to the continuum and stellar absorption features of the galaxies .",
    "we have measured the absorption equivalent widths of , , , and  in the synthetic spectra fitted to all 73 galaxies in our sample ( last four columns of table 3 and 4 ) .",
    "figure [ fig - abs ] shows the distributions of the equivalent widths of the four lines .",
    "the equivalent widths of , , and  range typically between 2   and 5   ( the distributions have different shapes for different lines ) , while that of  is typically less than 2  .",
    "hence , figure [ fig - abs ] indicates that adopting a constant absorption equivalent width for all h - balmer lines is only a crude approximation .",
    "our results are consistent with those of mas - hesse & kunth ( 1999 ) and olofsson ( 1995 )",
    ".    we can correct with accuracy , therefore , the fluxes of balmer emission lines for underlying stellar absorption in the spectra of bcgs . in a forthcoming study",
    ", we will exploit the nebular emission - line spectra ( obs  syn in figure  [ fig - spec ] ) of bcgs to constrain the rates of star formation and gas - phase chemical element abundances in these galaxies .",
    "it is worth noting that the reason why we are able to constrain simultaneously the ages and metallicities of the different stellar components in bcgs is that our approach is based on fitting stellar absorption lines , in addition to continuum fluxes .",
    "age and metallicity have similar effects on the continuum spectra of galaxies .",
    "however , some stellar absorption features such as , ,  and the g - band have been shown to depend mostly on age , while others , such as  and fe@xmath35709 , have been shown to depend mostly on metallicity ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use the  k @xmath33933 ,   @xmath34102 , cn @xmath34200 , g band @xmath34301 ,   @xmath34340 and  @xmath35176 absorption features to determine the stellar population of bcgs .",
    "these include both age - sensitive and metal - sensitive features",
    ". some of these absorption features may not be available in some spectra , which may lack , for example ,  and .",
    "also , some absorption features may be very shallow , and hence difficult to measure with high accuracy .",
    "for most galaxies , however , we find that the results of the empirical population synthesis analysis provide coarse but useful constraints on the histories of star formation and metal enrichment .      the most straightforward way to observe the star formation history of galaxies is through deep single - star photometry .",
    "this allows one to directly identify stars in various evolutionary phases through their positions in a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) containing the fossil record of the star formation history . during the past few years",
    ", intense activity has focused on the reconstruction of the star formation histories of nearby galaxies using this approach .",
    "several of these studies were performed on bcgs and led to new constraints on the ages of the oldest stars present in these galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the general conclusions from these studies are that bcgs contain evolved stellar populations , and that their star formation histories have been discontinuous .",
    "the basic shortcoming of this approach is that it can not be used in galaxies at large distances .",
    "in addition , the cmd - analysis method is also subject to several uncertainties such as distance determination , extinction , and contamination of stellar colors by gaseous emission .",
    "our results of the eps analysis of 73 bcgs are consistent with those of the cmd analysis of a few nearby galaxies , supporting the finding that bcgs are old galaxies with intermittent star formation .",
    "the evolutionary diagram constructed in figure  [ fig - ed ] above shows that the eps method is not only able to recognize composite systems from a handful of observable absorption - line features and continuum fluxes , but also to provide a rough description of the evolutionary state of the stellar components .",
    "therefore , the eps method provides a convenient tool for the study of stellar components and star formation histories of galaxies .",
    "it can be easily applied to the spectra gathered by large spectroscopic galaxy surveys .",
    "we have presented the results of an empirical population synthesis study of a sample of 73 blue compact galaxies . our main goal was to study the stellar components of bcgs .",
    "we have constrained the star formation histories of bcgs by comparing observed stellar absorption features and continuum fluxes with a library of star cluster spectra .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows :    bcgs present a variety of star formation histories , as inferred from the wide spread in stellar absorption equivalent widths and continuum colors from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "bcgs are typically age - composite stellar systems , in which different stellar components are clearly distinguished : the current starburst , an underlying older population , and some intermediate - age population .",
    "a quantitative analysis indicates that the nuclei of some bcgs are dominated by young components and the star - forming process is still ongoing . in most of bcgs ,",
    "stars older than 1  gyr contribute significantly to the integrated optical emission .",
    "the contribution by these stars can exceed 40% in some cases .",
    "overall , the stellar populations of bcgs suggest that they are old galaxies undergoing intermittent star formation episodes ; a typical bcgs is not presently forming its first generation of stars .",
    "we also find that the attenuation by dust is typically very small in the bcgs in our sample .",
    "our results are consistent with the results from deep imaging observations using hst and large ground - based telescopes .",
    "the virtue of the eps approach is that it is applied to integrated galaxy spectra .",
    "this method should be useful , therefore , for interpreting the spectra garthered by large spectroscopic galaxy surveys .",
    "the eps approach also provides accurate spectral fits of observed galaxy spectra . from these spectral fits , it is possible to measure with accuracy , in particular , the absorption strengths of stellar balmer lines and to correct the observed balmer emission - line fluxes for underlying stellar absorption .",
    "the pure emission - line spectra of the bcgs in our sample , resulting from the subtraction of the synthetic spectral fits from the observed spectra , will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
