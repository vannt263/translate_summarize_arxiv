    "the first successful simulations of binary black hole merger and coalescence @xcite marked a massive break - through in the field of numerical relativity . since then , numerous simulations of black hole binaries have produced important results , including predictions of the emitted gravitational wave forms for various binary configurations .",
    "many of these simulations have been performed with some version of the baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura ( bssn ) formulation  @xcite .",
    "their success depends crucially on the use of suitable coordinate conditions . for simulations of compact objects ,",

    "these studies showed that dynamical evolutions of a schwarzschild black hole result in spatial slices that do not encounter the central singularity , and instead asymptote to a finite areal radius . in a penrose diagram , these slices connect spatial infinity in one universe with time - like infinity in the other . in an embedding diagram (",
    "see , e.g.  fig .",
    "2 in  @xcite ) the slices resemble a trumpet , which explains why they are called  trumpet \" slices .",
    "it is not obvious that , in general , moving - puncture coordinates work well for regular initial data that collapse to a black hole . following earlier work  @xcite ,",
    "two independent calculations  @xcite considered stellar collapse and found that , in the cases considered , moving - puncture coordinates can indeed lead to stable evolution , with the newly - formed black hole expressed in a trumpet geometry .",
    "the primary motivation for this paper is to answer the question : _ in what scenario , if any , can the collapse of gravitational waves to a black hole be followed in moving - puncture coordinates ? _ to do this we consider axisymmetric vacuum data of two types , namely brill and teukolsky waves @xcite .",
    "a secondary motivation comes from the context of critical collapse ( see @xcite for reviews . ) critical collapse in gravitational systems was first discovered by choptuik  @xcite , who considered scalar fields in spherical symmetry .",
    "parametrizing the strength of the initial data with some parameter , say  @xmath0 , it is found that for sufficiently small  @xmath0 the fields ultimately propagate to infinity and leave behind flat space , possibly after interacting in a nonlinear fashion . above a critical value  @xmath1 of the amplitude ,",

    "so by choosing the parameters in the brill wave data carefully we can obtain evolutions comparable to those we had with teukolsky initial data .",
    "we presented numerical simulations of nonlinear gravitational waves .",
    "we adopted two different types of initial data  brill and teukolsky waves  and evolved them with two independent numerical codes .    we consistently find that positive amplitude brill waves , most commonly evolved in the literature , fail to produce long - term stable evolutions with the moving - puncture gauge , unless the initial amplitude is small . evolving these data with this gauge leads to steep gradients in metric functions , which ultimately spoil the numerical evolution . comparing with earlier studies it seems most likely that the failure is a coordinate singularity . for positive - amplitude brill waves we are also unable to locate black hole horizons , even for data that we believe do form black holes .    on the other hand , we find that teukolsky waves do allow a stable , long - term evolution in moving - puncture coordinates , unless the initial amplitude is close to critical .",
    "we followed the evolution of the waves and their collapse to a black hole , tracking the newly formed horizon , and confirming that the spatial slices settle down to a trumpet geometry .",
    "the primary motivation was therefore to provide one more example of successful simulations with moving - puncture coordinates that track the collapse of regular initial data to a black hole .",
    "another motivation is to point out the surprising , qualitative differences between brill and teukolsky wave initial data .",
    "we speculate that the choice of initial data has significantly contributed to the fact that the original studies of criticality in the collapse of nonlinear waves  @xcite have been so difficult to reproduce . in retrospect , it is surprising that none of the studies after  @xcite considered teukolsky waves .",
    "apart from choosing brill waves for technical convenience , this may appear justified because critical phenomena are not expected to depend on details of the initial data , which is an aspect of universality found in many studies .",
    "however , wave collapse in axisymmetry also marks a departure from spherical symmetry often used in other studies .",
    "axisymmetry opens up the possibility that new geometric aspects matter , and the present study is an example .",
    "our findings also raise new questions .",
    "in particular , it would be desirable to understand why brill and teukolsky waves behave so differently .",
    "we discussed a characterization of twist - free , axisymmetric data as either geometrically prolate or oblate .",
    "while this characterization does point to qualitative differences in the respective geometries , our analysis is incomplete in the sense that it does not consider the time - dependence of the characterization .",
    "we believe that it would be well - worth to further pursue this or similar approaches in order to gain a deeper insight into the geometries of these waves . on the basis of this characterization , as an attempt to make the brill wave data as close as possible to the teukolsky evolutions , we evolved off - center negative amplitude brill waves .",
    "we found that we were once again able to evolve such data through apparent horizon formation , and furthermore as they settle down to a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "unfortunately , our simulations still break down , even for teukolsky waves , in the most interesting regime , namely close to the critical amplitude .",
    "this prevents us from analyzing critical phenomena with our current simulations .",
    "we believe that this failure occurs because of the lack of sufficient spatial grid resolution .",
    "as one approaches the critical point , the evolution leads to oscillations on increasingly small scales . at least with moving - puncture coordinates ,",
    "the under - resolution of these oscillations causes the lapse to become negative , which then spoils the numerical evolution .",
    "the need for increasingly fine spatial resolution in the vicinity of the critical point is not a new revelation , of course ; it explains , for example , why a well - adjusted adaptive grid - refinement proved so crucial in the original simulations of choptuik @xcite .",
    "we also can not exclude the possibility that the moving - puncture coordinates themselves fail close to the critical point , irrespectively of resolution .",
    "in either case , we plan to develop techniques ( for example unequal grid - spacing in our spherical - coordinate code ) , and experiment with the slicing and gauge conditions , in order to study critical phenomena in the collapse of nonlinear waves in the future .",
