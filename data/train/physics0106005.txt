    "in this paper we consider the applications of a new numerical - analytical technique based on local nonlinear harmonic analysis ( wavelet analysis , generalized coherent states analysis ) to quantum / quasiclassical ( nonlinear ) beam / accelerator physics calculations .",
    "the reason for this treatment is that recently a number of problems appeared in which one needs take into account quantum properties of particles / beams .",
    "our starting point is the general point of view of deformation quantization approach at least on naive moyal / weyl / wigner level [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .",
    "the main point is that the algebras of quantum observables are the deformations of commutative algebras of classical observables ( functions ) [ 1 ] .",
    "so , if we have the poisson manifold @xmath0 ( symplectic manifolds , lie coalgebras , etc ) as a model for classical dynamics then for quantum calculations we need to find an associative ( but non - commutative ) star product @xmath1 on the space of formal power series in @xmath2 with coefficients in the space of smooth functions on @xmath0 such that @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the poisson brackets , @xmath5 are bidifferential operators .",
    "kontsevich gave the solution to this deformation problem in terms of formal power series via sum over graphs and proved that for every poisson manifold m there is a canonically defined gauge equivalence class of star - products on m. also there are nonperturbative corrections to power series representation for @xmath1 [ 1 ] .",
    "in naive calculations we may use simple formal rule : @xmath6 in this paper we consider calculations of wigner functions ( wf ) as the solution of wigner equations [ 2 ] ( part 2 ) :    @xmath7    and especially stationary wigner equations . our approach is based on extension of our variational - wavelet approach [ 3]-[14 ] .",
    "wavelet analysis is some set of mathematical methods , which gives us the possibility to work with well - localized bases in functional spaces and gives maximum sparse forms for the general type of operators ( differential , integral , pseudodifferential ) in such bases .",
    "these bases are natural generalization of standard coherent , squeezed , thermal squeezed states [ 2 ] , which correspond to quadratical systems ( pure linear dynamics ) with gaussian wigner functions .",
    "so , we try to calculate quantum corrections to classical dynamics described by polynomial nonlinear hamiltonians such as orbital motion in storage rings , orbital dynamics in general multipolar fields etc . from papers [ 3]-[14 ] .",
    "the common point for classical / quantum calculations is that any solution , which comes from full multiresolution expansion in all space / time ( or phase space ) scales , is represented via expansion into a slow part and fast oscillating parts ( part 3 ) .",
    "so , we may move from the coarse scales of resolution to the finest one to obtain more detailed information about our dynamical classical / quantum process .",
    "in this way we give contribution to our full solution from each scale of resolution .",
    "the same is correct for contributions to power spectral density ( energy spectrum ) : we can take into account contributions from each level / scale of resolution . because affine group of translations and dilations ( or more general group , which acts on the space of solutions ) is inside the approach ( in wavelet case ) , this method resembles the action of a microscope .",
    "we have contribution to final result from each scale of resolution from the whole underlying infinite scale of spaces .",
    "in part 4 we consider numerical modelling of wigner functions , which explicitly demonstrates quantum interference of generalized coherent states .",
    "according to weyl transform , quantum state ( wave function or density operator ) corresponds to wigner function , which is the analog of classical phase - space distribution [ 2 ] .",
    "we consider the following form of differential equations for time - dependent wf , @xmath8 : @xmath9\\cdot hw\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let @xmath10 be the density operator or projection operator corresponding to the energy eigenstate @xmath11 with energy eigenvalue @xmath12 . then time - independent schroedinger equation corresponding to hamiltonian @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an arbitrary polynomial function ( related beam dynamics models considered in [ 3]-[14 ] ) on @xmath15 , is [ 2 ] : @xmath16 after weyl - wigner mapping we get the following equation on wf in c - numbers : @xmath17 or @xmath18 after expanding the potential @xmath19 into the taylor series we have two real partial differential equations . in the next section",
    "we consider variation - wavelet approach for the solution of these equations for the case of an arbitrary polynomial @xmath20 , which corresponds to a finite number of terms in equations ( 7 ) up to any finite order of @xmath2 .",
    "let l be an arbitrary ( non)linear differential operator with matrix dimension @xmath21 , which acts on some set of functions @xmath22 from @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "let us consider now the n mode approximation for solution as the following ansatz ( in the same way we may consider different ansatzes ) : @xmath26 we shall determine the coefficients of expansion from the following variational conditions ( different related variational approaches are considered in [ 3]-[14 ] ) : @xmath27 so , we have exactly @xmath28 algebraical equations for @xmath28 unknowns @xmath29 .",
    "but in the case of equations for wf ( 7 ) we have overdetermined system of equations : @xmath30 equations for @xmath31 unknowns @xmath29 ( in this case @xmath32 ) . in this paper we consider non - standard method for resolving this problem , which is based on biorthogonal wavelet expansion .",
    "so , instead of expansion ( 9 ) we consider the following one : @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the bases dual to initial ones .    because wavelet functions are the generalization of coherent states we consider an expansion on this overcomplete set of basis wavelet functions as a generalization of standard coherent states expansion .",
    "so , variational approach reduced the initial problem ( 8) to the problem of solution of functional equations at the first stage and some algebraical problems at the second stage .",
    "we consider the multiresolution expansion as the second main part of our construction .",
    "we have contribution to final result from each scale of resolution from the whole infinite scale of increasing closed subspaces @xmath35 : @xmath36    the solution is parametrized by solutions of two reduced algebraical problems , one is linear or nonlinear ( 10 ) ( depends on the structure of operator l ) and the others are some linear problems related to computation of coefficients of algebraic equations ( 10 ) .",
    "these coefficients can be found by some wavelet methods .",
    "we use compactly supported wavelet basis functions for expansions ( 9 ) .",
    "we may consider different types of wavelets including general wavelet packets .",
    "now we concentrate on the last additional problem , that comes from overdeterminity of equations ( 7 ) , which demands to consider biorthogonal wavelet expansions .",
    "it leads to equal number of equations and unknowns in reduced algebraical system of equations ( 10 ) .",
    "we start with two hierarchical sequences of approximations spaces : @xmath37 @xmath38 and as usually , @xmath39 is complement to @xmath40 in @xmath41 , but now not necessarily orthogonal complement .",
    "functions @xmath42 generate a multiresolution analysis .",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 are synthesis functions , @xmath45 , @xmath46 are analysis functions .",
    "synthesis functions are biorthogonal to analysis functions .",
    "scaling spaces are orthogonal to dual wavelet spaces .",
    "biorthogonal point of view is more flexible and stable under the action of large class of operators while orthogonal ( one scale for multiresolution ) is fragile , all computations are much more simple and we accelerate the rate of convergence of our expansions ( 9 ) . by analogous anzatzes and approaches",
    "we may construct also the multiscale / multiresolution representations for solution of time dependent wigner equation ( 4 ) [ 14 ] .",
    "so , our constructions give us the following n - mode representation for solution of wigner equations ( 7 ) : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 may be represented by some family of ( nonlinear ) eigenmodes with the corresponding multiresolution / multiscale representation in the high - localized wavelet bases :    @xmath50    our ( nonlinear ) eigenmodes are more realistic for the modelling of nonlinear classical / quantum dynamical process than the corresponding linear gaussian - like coherent states . here",
    "we mention only the best convergence properties of expansions based on wavelet packets , which realize the so called minimal shannon entropy property . on fig .  1 we present the numerical modelling [ 15 ] of wigner function for a simple model of beam motion , which explicitly demonstrates quantum interference property . on fig .  2 we present the multiscale / multiresolution representation ( 11 ) for solution of wigner equation .",
    "we would like to thank the u.s . civilian research & development foundation ( crdf ) for support ( grants tgp-454 , 455 ) , which gave us the possibility to present our nine papers during pac2001 conference in chicago and ms.camille de walder from crdf for her help and encouragement .",
