    "single - photon sources are a very important resource in optical quantum communication and computation , and are currently at the forefront of the experimental effort in optical quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "in particular , sources that generate entangled multi - photon states are very useful , for example in cryptography @xcite , linear optical quantum computing @xcite , and heisenberg - limited metrology and quantum lithography @xcite .",
    "in addition , entanglement between qubits of a different physical nature ( e.g. , light and matter ) is crucial for distributed quantum computing .    here , we consider three alternative representations for encoding qubits in photonic states .",
    "qubits can be encoded in the polarization , dual - rail , and time - bin degree of freedom .",
    "the first two are equivalent in that linear optical elements ( polarization beam - splitters , polarization rotators ) transform between the two deterministically . here the qubit degree of freedom is the population of two distinct modes , either two orthogonal polarization modes or two spatial modes , so a maximally entangled two - qubit state is written as @xmath0 energy level configuration ) , and mapping the entanglement onto polarization - encoded photonic qubits , have also recently been proposed @xcite .",
    "the scheme presented here uses an alternative energy level scheme , and is also naturally suited to creating time - bin encoded states .",
    "the matter system that we consider here is illustrated in fig .",
    "the system consists of an atom - like system comprising three energy levels , with two low - lying levels denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 that are ( near ) degenerate , and one excited state @xmath3 , which is separated from the low - lying levels by an optical transition .",
    "we assume that the optical transition only couples the levels @xmath4 , and that the transition @xmath5 is forbidden , e.g. due to a selection rule .",
    "the low lying states @xmath1 and @xmath2 may be thought of as a qubit degree of freedom .",
    "we assume that arbitrary unitary operations can be performed on this qubit , and furthermore , that one can perform single shot measurements of the qubit in the computational basis , @xmath6 .",
    "[ r]@xmath7-pulse    the existence of the optical transition means that the matter system can also act as an on - demand single photon source .",
    "the three level system is placed in an optical cavity , such that the cavity mode couples to the @xmath8 . applying an optical @xmath7-pulse ( e.g. using a classical laser field ) to the system , tuned to the optical transition ,",
    "induces the transformation @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "provided that spontaneous emission into modes other than the cavity mode can be neglected , the matter qubit - cavity system will emit a single photon into the desired mode , with an emission rate approximately given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the jaynes - cummings coupling between the @xmath13 transition and the cavity mode @xcite .",
    "we define a time @xmath14 which is the length of time that one should wait for the observation of a photon in a photo - detector after the optical @xmath7-pulse has been applied .",
    "provided @xmath15 , and the initial state of the source was @xmath16 , a single photon wavepacket will be emitted into the desired mode with probability very close to one .",
    "note that the emission of a photon from this system is conditional on the initial state of the qubit degree of freedom . in some physical implementations",
    ", it may be advantageous to use a fourth auxiliary level , such that the @xmath13 transition is replaced by a stirap process in a @xmath17 configuration of three levels @xcite .",
    "matter qubits ( with a computational basis @xmath6 ) can be prepared in entangled states using the _ double - heralding _",
    "technique described in @xcite .",
    "we briefly review this technique here .",
    "we entangle two qubits by first preparing two atoms in separate cavities in the separable state latexmath:[$(|\\up\\rangle +    optical @xmath7-pulse to each atom , and wait for a time @xmath14 .",
    "this yields the total state @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively denote the vacuum and a single photon wavepacket in the freely propagating optical mode leaving the cavity .",
    "when these two modes interact in a 50:50 beam splitter , the total state becomes @xmath22 \\ ; .",
    "\\nonumber\\ ] ] note that the beam splitter must be placed in such a way that the spatio - temporal photon modes overlap at the beam splitter , in order to erase the ` which path ' information .",
    "detecting both the outgoing modes of the beam splitter , each with a realistic detector ( i.e. a detector with finite efficiency , and which can not discriminate between optical states with one or more photons ) , gives the following state of the qubits ( given just a single detector click ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the relative phase in @xmath25 is determined by the detection signature , ( `` click'',``no click '' ) or ( `` no click'',``click '' ) for the two detectors .",
    "the state in eq .",
    "( [ intermediate ] ) is an incoherent mixture of a maximally entangled state and the separable state @xmath26 .",
    "however , we can remove this separable part by first applying a bit flip operation @xmath27 to both matter qubits .",
    "we subsequently apply a second @xmath7-pulse to each matter system .",
    "the separable part can not generate photons .",
    "thus , conditional on observing another single detector click , the final two qubit state @xmath28 is obtained .",
    "the total success probability of this procedure is @xmath29 .",
    "note that we can also make _ any _ pure two - qubit state by using the initial states @xmath30 ) , which of course represents an idealization of the state of the two qubit system after the _ double - heralding _ operation . in real systems , physical imperfections can reduce the fidelity of the state .",
    "perhaps the most important such imperfection is that of photon loss , for example by emission into unwanted modes , absorption in the optical elements , or detector inefficiency .",
    "it turns out that such losses do not affect the fidelity of our entangled output states , but merely reduce the success probability of the protocol @xcite .",
    "mismatch in the cavity parameters @xmath12 and @xmath31 between different cavities can reduce the fidelity .",
    "however this scheme is reasonably robust to such losses : a mismatch of a few percent leads to a reduction in fidelity of less than @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "decoherence of the qubit degrees of freedom can also reduce fidelity .",
    "however this can be mitigated by choosing a system whose intrinsic decoherence time is long compared to @xmath14 ; examples of such systems were given in @xcite .",
    "we can now create entangled states between the matter qubits and photons by applying more @xmath7-pulses ( and bit flips ) .",
    "this type of ` hetero - entanglement ' ( entanglement between systems of a different physical class ) can be very useful , for example in quantum key distribution via the ekert protocol @xcite . in that case",
    ", it is sufficient for alice and bob to share _ any _ maximally entangled two - qubit state , such as @xmath33 denote polarized photons ) .",
    "alice can measure her matter qubit in a spin basis of her choice , while bob uses photo - detection in a polarization basis that he chooses .",
    "alice and bob can share hetero - entanglement using time - bin photons , polarized photons , or dual rail photons . to generate time - bin entanglement , let alice hold a cavity with a matter qubit in the state @xmath34 . after applying an optical @xmath7-pulse , waiting for a time @xmath14 , applying a bit flip , applying another optical @xmath7-pulse , and waiting for a second time window @xmath14",
    ", the total state will be given by @xmath35a ) .",
    "note that , when qubits are represented by such time - bin photons , alice and bob must share some classical timing reference information , such that both parties agree on the definition of ` early ' and ` late ' time bins .",
    "this information could be provided by , for example , a shared classical laser pulse or electronic signal .",
    "alternatively , we can entangle the qubit with the polarization degree of freedom of a photon .",
    "this variant requires two matter qubits : alice first prepares the two matter qubits in the maximally entangled state @xmath36 .",
    "this is formally equivalent to a _",
    "qubit @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the next step in generating hetero - entanglement is then to apply a @xmath7-pulse to the two matter qubits , and waiting for a time @xmath14 for a photon to be emitted . by construction",
    ", a photon will be emitted by one and only one of the matter systems .",
    "at this point we have generated hetero - entanglement between the composite qubit system and a dual - rail photon .",
    "assuming that the outgoing photon has a definite polarization ( e.g. , horizontal ) , one of the modes undergoes a polarization rotation , and the two modes are combined with a polarization beam splitter ( see fig .  [ fig2]b ) .",
    "the total system will be in the state @xmath39 , as may be required for some applications .",
    "however , it is possible to remove one of the physical qubits by performing a measurement in the @xmath40 basis , where @xmath41 .",
    "note that this state contains only one matter qubit , which can be manipulated using single qubit operations .",
    "the relative phase between the terms is determined by the outcome of the physical qubit measurement .",
    "this conditional phase can be corrected using a single qubit operation on either the matter qubit or the photon , provided sufficiently fast classical switching is available .",
    "alternatively , it is sufficient in many applications just to keep a ( classical ) record of the relative phase , and take it into account when interpreting the results of individual measurements of the entangled qubits .",
    "the entangled states of matter qubits can also be used to make entangled states of light .",
    "suppose we want to make time - bin entanglement of the form @xmath42 .",
    "we start with the two - qubit state @xmath36 and apply a @xmath7-pulse to the two cavities . after a time @xmath14 the total state is then @xmath43 that is",
    ", the early photon wavepacket @xmath44 has left the cavities .",
    "we then perform a bit - flip on the qubits , after which we apply the second @xmath7-pulse to both cavities . after a further time @xmath14 , this yields the highly entangled state @xmath45 this",
    "may be thought of as four - party hetero - entanglement .",
    "when we want two - photon entanglement , we have to _ disentangle _ the photons from the matter qubits . to this end",
    ", we apply a hadamard operation to both matter qubits .",
    "the total state then becomes @xmath46 a measurement of the matter qubits in the computational basis will then reveal which particular form of entanglement we have prepared . as in the case of hetero - entanglement between matter qubits and polarization qubits ,",
    "when the measurement outcome is @xmath47 or @xmath48 , the relative minus sign can be directly corrected using a fast - switching phase shift on one of the qubits , or by taking account of the relative phase when interpreting subsequent measurement outcomes . when the output of the two cavities is sent to alice and bob ,",
    "respectively , they will share maximal two - photon time - bin entanglement ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .    in order to make maximal dual rail and polarization entanglement",
    ", we need four matter qubits in four separate leaky cavities ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "a @xmath7-pulse applied to each of these systems will yield the following transformation , after a time @xmath14 : @xmath49 where we have used the composite qubit systems @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the states @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote a single photon with a dual - rail degree of freedom .    the four matter qubits must first be prepared in the state @xmath54 .",
    "this state corresponds to a ghz state of four matter qubits which , as noted above , may be generated by first preparing a larger cluster state and subsequently performing single qubit measurements .",
    "subsequently , applying a @xmath7-pulse to each matter qubit generates a highly entangled state @xmath55 again , we have to transform each of the four matter qubits with a hadamard gate , and perform a measurement of the four matter qubits in the computational basis .",
    "up to correctable relative phases , we have obtained the required entangled state .",
    "there is a duality between the dual - rail representation and the time - bin representation . in the dual - rail ( or polarization ) representation ,",
    "we need @xmath56 matter qubits in a suitable state to create an @xmath57-photon entangled state @xmath58 . on the other hand , in the time - bin representation",
    "we need only @xmath57 matter qubits , but we need to apply the @xmath7-pulse twice ( with an intermediary bit flip on all the qubits ) . in their respective computational bases ,",
    "these representations are thus completely equivalent .",
    "the definition of @xmath50 and @xmath51 is particularly fruitful , in that it immediately suggests a generalization of the schemes presented here .",
    "we consider the generation of polarized photonic states .",
    "let @xmath59 be a string of @xmath57 photonic qubit states in the computational basis ( for example , when @xmath60 , the four strings @xmath59 for polarized photons are @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ) .",
    "any pure ( entangled ) state can then be written as @xmath65 in order to create such a state , we need to create a @xmath56-qubit state @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a string of @xmath57 bipartite qubits @xmath50 and @xmath51 and @xmath68 the vacuum of @xmath57 spatial modes . if such a state can be obtained with a quantum computer , we can use the technique in @xcite to create the appropriate cluster state and do the computation .",
    "the final state is then given by eq .",
    "( [ multi ] ) .    a @xmath7-pulse into all @xmath56 cavities",
    "will then create the photons , which are still heavily entangled with the qubits : @xmath69 applying local hadamard operations to all matter qubits and measuring them in the computational basis then yields the desired state up to local single - photon transformations .",
    "@xmath70 , \\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the detector signature of all @xmath56 matter qubits , and @xmath72 is the hadamard transform of a single matter qubit .",
    "there are @xmath73 possible detector outcomes ( indexed by @xmath74 ) , and the output state @xmath75 can be transformed into @xmath58 with phase shifters and polarization rotations .",
    "the procedures described above for generating dual rail or time - bin entanglement can similarly be generalized to the multi - qubit case .",
    "it is worth noting briefly the effect that photon loss has on the scalability of the scheme .",
    "photon loss can , ultimately , be detected , since in many applications , all the photons can be detected at the end of the experiment .",
    "thus photon loss in itself need not degrade the fidelity of the resulting entangled states .",
    "however , the total success probability ( i.e. the probability of detecting all @xmath57 photons ) scales exponentially with @xmath57 .",
    "this will ultimately place an upper limit on @xmath57 in a practical experiment .",
    "nevertheless , even relatively small numbers of entangled photonic qubits can be a useful resource in quantum information processing tasks such as cryptography @xcite and heisenberg - limited metrology @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they can be used as a resource in linear optical quantum computing schemes @xcite , which are in principle scalable .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown how the double - heralded entangling operation introduced by barrett and kok @xcite can be used to create multi - partite photonic entanglement . in particular",
    ", we can create any ( entangled ) state of photonic qubits that can be written as the outcome of a universal quantum computer .",
    "this works in the polarization and dual rail basis , as well as in the time - bin degree of freedom .",
    "in addition , we can generate hetero - entanglement between ( many ) qubits of a different physical nature .",
    "this is crucial for distributed quantum computing , where local clusters of matter qubits can be connected via optical ( flying ) qubits .",
    "2 truecm _ acknowledgments _ : pk and sdb have contributed equally to this work .",
    "we thank rob thew for bringing the virtues of time - bin entanglement to our attention , and yuan liang lim and almut beige for fruitful discussions .",
