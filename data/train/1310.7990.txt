    "true three - body collision processes ( a+b+c ) are vitally important in a number of physical and chemical contexts,@xcite , yet theoretical studies have been far less extensive than the vast literature that exists for two - body entrance channels ( ab+c ) .",
    "classical trajectory methods are based on the assumption that the motion of each of the nuclei in a chemical systems is governed to a good approximation by the laws of classical mechanics on the quantal potential energy surface given by the adiabatic electronic energy of the system .",
    "these methods have been successfully applied to calculations of scattering observables ( e.g. the differential cross section , the reaction probability and the integral or total cross section ) in many different chemical systems , often showing good agreement with experimental results and with quantum calculations.@xcite perhaps surprisingly , the classical trajectory methods can in some cases describe demanding properties of the chemical systems , such as the kinetic isotope effect observed in muonic isotopologues of the h + h@xmath4 reaction.@xcite    in general , the agreement between classical trajectory methods and quantum mechanical calculations deteriorates at lower collision energies , where a low number of partial waves contribute .",
    "one might imagine that this issue would prevent us from studying cold and ultracold collisions by means of classical trajectory methods .",
    "however , in these situations it is informative to capitalize on the intuitive framework provided by the classical trajectory methods to analyze the role of the quantum effects and compare with newtonian predictions .",
    "recently , li and heller@xcite have applied classical trajectory calculations to simulate buffer - gas cooling experiments with helium atoms and large rigid asymmetric - top molecules at a temperature as cold as 6.5 k. that treatment enabled the authors to calculate the lifetimes of long - lived orbiting resonances associated with the motion of an atom around a large molecule.@xcite they also predict that the production of cold molecules could be made more efficient by increasing the density of the buffer - gas.@xcite this exemplifies the potential utility of classical trajectory calculations for understanding the collision dynamics , even for cold systems .    at the same time , different mechanisms have been postulated at different times for three - body recombination .",
    "one of these is direct three - body recombination , which is closest to the class of processes considered in the present work .",
    "a second class of mechanisms involves indirect or  two - step pathways , in which two of the particles initially collide and form a transient resonant state of vibration and/or rotation , followed by a subsequent de - excitation of the resonant state into a bound dimer in a second collision between the dimer and a third atom .",
    "this second class has been considered extensively in the literature and there are a number of different versions of it depending on which degree of freedom is initially excited in the first resonant collision .",
    "it is variously termed the  lindemann - hinshelwood mechanism , or when formulated more specifically for three - atom collisions , one frequently sees reference to this as the  rbc mechanism after the authors roberts , bernstein , and curtiss.@xcite    while a `` direct '' three - body recombination collision would seem to be fundamentally different from these two - step mechanisms , one study has claimed that all of the alternative three - body mechanisms are equivalent and should produce identical three - body recombination rate coefficients.@xcite the present study of helium three - body recombination can indirectly test this assertion , because the @xmath5he dimer has only one bound state and no discernible resonances on the electronic ground state potential .",
    "thus the lindemann - hinshelwood or rbc mechanism predicts a vanishing three - body recombination rate , whereas both the quantal and classical calculations presented below produce direct recombination rates at low energy that exceed @xmath6@xmath7/s .",
    "it remains unclear how this might be reconciled with the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "the long , scholarly study by pack , walker , and kendrick@xcite also raised doubt as to the practical applicability of this claimed equivalence of indirect versus direct mechanisms .",
    "the continuing development of both classical@xcite and nonperturbative quantum mechanical descriptions@xcite of this fundamental process is also interesting in view of recent approximate theory that computes quantum mechanical ternary rates in various approximations .",
    "one such application@xcite has recently been applied to the crucial astrophysical problem of hydrogen atom three - body recombination .",
    "the hydrogen results presented appear to represent the current state of the art for three - body recombination in this system , but the main approximation utilized in that study ( an energy sudden approximation ) should be assessed critically .",
    "to explore other theoretical studies of recombination or its time - reverse process ( collision - induced dissociation , cid ) and the validity of various approximation methods , see also refs.@xcite    the present paper implements a general method to study classical collisions in @xmath0-dimensions .",
    "this method utilizes classical trajectory calculations to calculate the three - body recombination rate ( tbrr ) for helium atoms in a framework related to the pioneering formulation of f. t. smith.@xcite the collision treated range from ultracold energies 10@xmath8 k to the thermal range 10@xmath9 k. the classical calculations are compared with quantum results that we have computed for the tbrr in the @xmath1=@xmath2 symmetry only .",
    "the quantum calculations are based on the combination of the adiabatic hyperspherical representation@xcite and the r - matrix method to obtain the scattering properties.@xcite the hamiltonian is represented in a discrete variable representation ( dvr),@xcite with some modifications for a better description of the nonadiabatic couplings at short - range distances.@xcite among the key results obtained are the classical threshold law for tbrr as a function of the collision energy and a relationship between the classical and quantum predictions for high collision energies . in particular , we find a result that can be interpreted as an @xmath0-dimensional generalization of the shadow scattering in two - body collisions.@xcite",
    "this section presents our method for studying classical collisions in an arbitrary number of dimensions @xmath10 .",
    "this method emerges from a simple generalization to @xmath0-dimensions of the concepts necessary to formulate the scattering problem in classical mechanics , i.e. the impact parameter and the cross section . as an illustration of the method ,",
    "the cross section for the hard - sphere model in @xmath0-dimensions is derived .",
    "this calculation generalizes the two - body hard - sphere collision formulas , an essential model that is useful for characterizing high energy collisions .      in classical scattering",
    ", the collision between two particles can be seen in two equivalent ways : either a particle impinges upon a scattering center or two particles approach to each other with some interaction . after removing the ignorable center - of - mass ( cm ) motion and formulating the collision in the relative motion coordinate ,",
    "the second situation is identical to the first one .",
    "this generalizes the notion of single particle scattering to @xmath0-dimensions .",
    "( for @xmath11 particles colliding in ordinary three - dimensional space in the absence of an external field , note that the total dimensionality of the collision is equal to @xmath12 . )    in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) collision , a particle with a defined momentum moves towards a scattering center .",
    "the cross section for a collisional process is defined as the area drawn in a plane perpendicular to the initial momentum , which the relative motion of the particles needs to cross if a collision is to take place.@xcite the impact parameter vector , @xmath13 , basically determines the scattering , and it is defined as the component of the vector position that lies in the plane perpendicular to the momentum before the collision.@xcite both the impact parameter vector and the scattering cross section are readly extended to the @xmath0-dimensional scattering . however , instead of dealing with a plane we must work with an @xmath14-dimensional hyperplane , perpendicular to the direction of the initial momentum .",
    "thus an integral over the impact parameter will be equivalent to the hyperarea of the hyperplane ( in 3d we use the concept of area ) perpendicular to the initial momentum .",
    "if one attaches the opacity function @xmath15 that counts the number of trajectories that contribute to the specific collision process of interest ( e.g. chemical reaction , elastic scattering , etc . )",
    ", then the integral will give the hyperarea over such hyperplane weighted by those trajectories involved in the process , i.e. the cross section .",
    "it can be expressed as    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the differential solid angle element of the hyperangles of @xmath13 and @xmath14 indicates the dimensionality of the hyperspace where @xmath13 is defined .",
    "the opacity function , @xmath18 is the probability that a trajectory with particular initial conditions leads to the process under study .",
    "classical trajectory calculations are performed in order to determine the opacity function , which is the key function required in order to obtain the cross section .",
    "( [ s-1 ] ) yields the cross section for a particular orientation of the momentum , but the main quantity of interest in our present exploration is the cross section for a particular magnitude of the momentum , @xmath19 .",
    "it is done by averaging eq .",
    "( [ s-1 ] ) over the hyperangles associated with the momentum , i.e. ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 represents the hyperangles of the canonical mass - weighted momentum vector @xmath22 in the @xmath0-dimensional space .",
    "this method is readily applied to a hard - sphere model collision in @xmath0-dimensions .",
    "we introduce the hard - hypersphere opacity function as    @xmath23    this expression of the opacity function is independent of the orientation of @xmath13 and @xmath22 ( owing to the spherical symmetry of the model ) and it only leads to a collision event when the magnitude of the impact parameter @xmath24 is less than a certain threshold distance @xmath25 , the interaction radius of the hard - hypersphere .    inserting eq.([hs-1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ s-2 ] ) , the cross section is expressed as    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the solid angle subtended by a @xmath14-dimensional sphere ( in the geometrical sense ) .",
    "taking into account the general expression for the solid angle for a @xmath28-sphere @xmath29,@xcite where @xmath30 is the gamma function and @xmath28 represents the dimension of the sphere , we finally obtain    @xmath31    eq .",
    "( [ hs-3 ] ) generalizes of the well - known expression of the cross section of the hard - sphere model in 3d , namely @xmath32 , to @xmath0-dimension . to understand this relationship more deeply",
    ", one can visualize the circle as the intersection between a 3d sphere and a plane , and on the other hand the @xmath14-dimensional sphere is the intersection of an @xmath0-dimensional sphere and an @xmath14-dimensional hyperplane .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional classical scattering method assisted by classical trajectory calculations is now implemented to calculate the tbrr for helium atoms as a function of the collision energy from ultracold energies , 10@xmath8 k , to thermal energies , 1000 k. the classical trajectory calculations consist of a detailed implementation of the ideas pioneered by felix t. smith,@xcite with monte carlo ( mc ) sampling of trajectories used to calculate the opacity function and the three - body recombination cross section ( tbrcs ) , which leads to the tbrr as is explained in this section .",
    "the results we obtain by applying this @xmath0-dimensional classical scattering method to three - body collisions include the classical ultracold threshold law for tbrr as a function of the collision energy .",
    "another result that emerges is the relationship between the classical and quantum elastic three - body cross sections , resulting in an expression similar to the shadow scattering present in two - body collision.@xcite      next consider the classical scattering of three particles .",
    "their motion of three particles in a potential energy landscape , @xmath33 is governed by the hamiltonian    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the momentum and the vector position of the @xmath37 particle , respectively . in order to simplify the hamiltonian we introduce the jacobi coordinates ( see fig.1 ) defined by the relations    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the total mass of the system .",

    "@xcite a 6d position vector is constructed form the two jacobi vectors @xmath47 and @xmath48 as    @xmath55    hereafter , 6d vectors are represented in hyperspherical coordinates .",
    "the mass - scaled 6d canonical momentum vector can be written as    @xmath56    where @xmath57 . now that the position vector and the momentum in a 6d space have been defined , the concept of impact parameter as the projection of the position vector in a hyperplane perpendicular to the initial momentum is clear . and",

    "this is not an essential aspect of the method , however , and it is possible for future studies to complete these calculations using a full three - body potential energy surface . in particular these calculations adopt the helium atom - atom interaction of aziz et al . , designated hfd - b3-fci1@xcite , which has been tested on measurements of the transport coefficients and the second order virial coefficient , with demonstrated accuracy in the predictions of this interaction potential .",
