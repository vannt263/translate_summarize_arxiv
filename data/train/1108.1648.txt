    "the nature of the ground state phases in interacting quantum many body systems is often strongly influenced by the spatial dimensionality .",
    "this is a direct consequence of enhanced quantum fluctuations that result in novel quantum phases in systems with reduced dimensionality that are not present in the isotropic limit .",
    "a prominent example of this phenomenon is the haldane gap phase in spin-1 heisenberg antiferromagnetic ( hafm ) chains .",
    "haldane proved that the ground state of the one - dimensional spin-1 hafm is gapped  @xcite whereas there is strong numerical evidence that the ground state in higher dimensions is the gapless ne ' el state  @xcite .    in this paper , we study the emergence of the haldane phase as the quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) limit is approached , starting from the isotropic spin-1 hafm and varying the interchain coupling continuously .",
    "the quasi - two - dimensional ( q2d ) limit is also explored by varying the inter - layer coupling in a continuous manner .",
    "the zero - field 1d phase diagram has been well mapped  @xcite , and the 1d field - dependence has also been reported  @xcite .",
    "the 2d phase diagram is also well known  @xcite . here , we attempt to extend this knowledge to the q1d and q2d limits , and to make a connection to the isotropic 3d limit .",
    "in addition to elucidating the nature of the emergence of the effects of reduced dimensionality , our results have direct relevance to recent experiments on q1d and q2d ni - based spin-1 heisenberg quantum antiferromagnets .",
    "the hamiltonian for a spin-1 heisenberg antiferromagnet on an anisotropic cubic lattice is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the applied magnetic field , @xmath2 is a single - ion anisotropy parameter , and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) represents nearest neighbor spin pairs with in - plane ( out - of - plane ) bonds .",
    "the saturation field can be determined by a zero energy cost to flip a single spin in the fully polarized ground state , and is given by @xmath5 .",
    "we define a dimensional anisotropy parameter @xmath6 as the ratio @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) for q1d ( q2d ) systems .",
    "thus , in either the q1d or q2d case , the low - dimensional limit is achieved as @xmath6 approaches zero .",
    "we have performed large - scale numerical calculations of the above hamiltonian using the stochastic series expansion quantum monte carlo method with operator - loop updates  @xcite . in all our simulations , either @xmath9 or @xmath10",
    "is always set to 1 , so that the inverse temperature , @xmath11 , is in units relative to the isotropic interaction strength ( @xmath9 in the q1d regime and @xmath10 in the q2d regime ) .",
    "in figure  [ 1d2d ] we show the magnetization curves as we approach the q1d ( left panel ) and q2d ( right panel ) limits . shown in the insets",
    "is the uniform static susceptibility , @xmath12 , which displays a peak just before the saturation field .",
    "the height of this peak increases as @xmath6 is diminished , the effect being most pronounced for the q1d system . additionally , for the q1d system with @xmath13 , a haldane gap appears in the magnetic response at low fields .",
    "next , we turn our attention to the low - field behavior of the q1d systems , where a spin - gapped haldane phase is expected for 1d systems  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ crossover ] we plot the uniform magnetization at low field for systems ranging from the isotropic 3d limit to the q1d limit . in the extreme q1d limit ( @xmath14 ) ,",
    "a spin gap is clearly seen in the magnetic response to applied field . in the other limit for @xmath6 near the isotropic 3d value ,",
    "no gap is present .",
    "thus , we see a crossover from 3d to 1d behavior at a critical value of the anisotropy , @xmath15 , that we estimate to be @xmath16 , as this value separates the two observed limits . whether or not there is a haldane gap precisely at @xmath17 is difficult to determine due to possible finite - size and finite - temperature effects .",
    "now we determine the effect of adding an easy - plane anisotropy to the zero - field q1d system in the effective 1d limit ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the haldane gap phase is destroyed as the value of @xmath2 is increased , as shown in figure  [ dd ] .",
    "here we note that this occurs rather rapidly , as no gap is seen for @xmath18 , when it is known that in 1d the gap persists up to @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "finally , we show the full field behavior for @xmath20 in the q1d and q2d limits in figure  [ 1dd2dd ] .",
    "we find that the peak in @xmath12 near the saturation field increases with increasing @xmath2 for both q1d and q2d systems .",
    "a broad , shallow peak also emerges in the q1d system for @xmath21 .",
    "this may be associated with the approach of a quantum paramagnetic phase at large @xmath2 .",
    "this spin - gapped phase is seen in the q1d system at @xmath22 and in the q2d system for @xmath23 .",
    "in the haldane phase at zero field , there is a spin gap @xmath24 to magnetic excitations .",
    "this gap closes under an applied field @xmath25  @xcite . below this critical value of the magnetic field",
    "the ground state magnetization is zero . in 1d",
    "the haldane gap is well known to be @xmath26 , in units of @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath27 or , utilizing @xmath28 in 1d , @xmath29 .",
    "we can estimate @xmath30 for our q1d calculations from figure  [ crossover ] .",
    "taking into account thermal effects , we find @xmath31 in the effective 1d limit .",
    "this is slightly below , but in general agreement with , the pure 1d result .",
    "we can also compare our estimate of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 , see figure  [ crossover ] ) with a mean field theory ( mft ) result of @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the difference between our value and the mft calculation can be attributed to two likely causes .",
    "one is that we are using relatively small system sizes , which will tend to show finite size gaps .",
    "the other is a tendency for the mft to overestimate order , implying that @xmath15 from mft may be a lower bound  @xcite .",
    "we have shown a crossover from 3d to q1d physics as the in - plane spin couplings are reduced towards zero ( relative to the easy - axis spin couplings ) .",
    "the result is the emergence of the haldane phase for @xmath33 .",
    "the behavior of the magnetization curve in the q2d limit was also calculated .",
    "the susceptibility peak near the saturation field was found to increase with decreasing @xmath6 .",
    "this same effect appears in the q1d limit , though much more pronounced .",
    "we also showed the effect of an easy - plane single - ion anisotropy .",
    "in addition to sharpening the susceptibility peak , a gapped phase appears for large values of @xmath2 .",
    "these results are relevant to understanding the magnetization processes in real materials .",
    "in particular , the gapless states of the q1d and q2d systems are expected to help characterize the magnetic behavior of a class of low - dimensional ni compounds .",
    "we have already seen promising qualitative agreement with our q2d simulations .",
    "we would like to thank paul goddard for stimulating our interest in this work as well as for discussions regarding the experimental relevance of this model to ni - based quantum magnets .",
