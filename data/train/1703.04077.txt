    "the ultimate goal of studying relativistic heavy ion collisions is to extract from experimentally measured final particle momentum distributions quantitatively precise information on the transport properties and dynamical evolution of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) generated in these collisions .",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy of particle emission in the transverse plane , known as anisotropic flow , is one key observable suggesting that qgp behaves like an almost perfect liquid @xcite .",
    "using an azimuthal fourier expansion of the single particle distribution up to harmonic order @xmath3 , this anisotropy can be characterized by @xmath4 parameters : the flow magnitude @xmath5 and the flow angle @xmath6 relative to the reaction plane which is often called @xmath7-th order event plane angle ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "they are combined into the complex flow vectors @xmath9 .",
    "due to quantum mechanical fluctuations in the initial conditions created in heavy - ion collisions , the flow vectors @xmath10 fluctuate from event to event , even for identical impact parameters and collision systems .",
    "correlations between anisotropic flow vectors of different orders have been studied both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "examples are correlations between flow angles ( a.k.a , event - plane correlations ) @xcite , correlations between the magnitudes of the flow harmonics @xcite , and nonlinear mode coupling effects between flow vector contributing to @xmath10 for @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "these correlations may shed light on the fluctuating initial conditions , but their strength is also affected by dissipative effects ion the dynamical evolution of the qgp . form . ]",
    "since measurements of such correlations are very statistics - hungry , existing correlation studies are almost exclusively for the integrated flows , using the flow vectors of all charged particles in a centarin rapidity window without differentiating them according to their transverse momentum .",
    "given the continuously increasing number of collected data we here ask the question what would change if one performed this studies differentially in transverse momentum .",
    "we present a systematic study of the correlation between differential flows of differerent harmonic orders for pb+pb collisions at 2.76 tev , using the vish2 + 1 hydrodynamic code @xcite to describe the dynamical evolution of the collision .",
    "admittedly , our study does not suffer from the same kind of statistical limitations faced by experimentalists : we use the cooper - frye prescription to compute the final particle spectra from the hydrodynamic output , which yields a continuous final particle momentum distribution , corresponding to the limit of an infinite number of particles emitted from each event .",
    "therefore , our results are affected only by fluctuations associated with the fluctuating initial conditions ( which we sample by evolving 2000 events per centrality class through the hydrodynamic code ) and not by finite number statistical fluctuations in the final state that arise in real experiments from the fact that nature , due to the limited energy content of each event , can sample the final momentum distribution only with a finite number of particles .",
    " we here use the mc - glauber initial conditions as input , start the hydrodynamic evolution at @xmath12 fm/@xmath13 without pre - equilibrium flow , and end it on an isothermal freeze - out surface of temperature @xmath14 mev .",

    "the results are discussed and summarised in sec .",
    "some studies elucidating the meaning of the linear part ( previously called the `` linear response part '' ) of higher harmonic flows are presented in the appendix .",
    "correlations between different flow angles are usually called event plane correlations whereas the correlations between the angles associated with the corresponding initial spatial eccentricities are known as participant plane correlations .",
    "these multi - plane correlations have yielded insight into the initial conditions and hydrodynamic evolution of heavy ion collisions @xcite .    to calculate the event plane correlations we use the scalar product definition which does not depend on the event - plane resolution @xcite : @xmath16 here ,",
    "@xmath17 is chosen as an example of a two - plane correlation , and @xmath18 as an example of a three - plane correlation : @xmath19 from this definition we see that @xmath20 in fact equals the pearson correlation coefficient between @xmath1 and @xmath21 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath22 does not equal the pearson correlation coefficient between @xmath2 and @xmath23 unless the fluctuations of the elliptic and triangular flows are uncorrelated and factorize as follows : @xmath24 . while this may be a reasonable assumption for @xmath25 and @xmath26 because @xmath26 is dominated by initial state fluctuations",
    "whereas @xmath25 has generally a strong geometric component , it is certainly not justifiable for the correlation between @xmath27 and @xmath28 which are correlated with each other by the deformed initial collision geometry in non - central collisions .",
    "this geometric correlation between the elliptic and quadrangular flow magnitudes affects the three - plane correlation @xmath29 .",

    "( this is different from the usual definition of second- or third - order @xmath0-differential flow cumulants ( see e.g. @xcite ) where only one particle comes from the selected @xmath0 bin and its flow vector is correlated with others constructed from all charged hadrons . )",
    "red circles denote event - plane correlations of differential flows from ideal hydrodynamic evolution , and the red shaded bands show the corresponding @xmath0-integrated event - plane correlations of integrated for the same events for comparison",

    "the upper ( lower ) panels are for central ( 0 - 5% centrality ) and mid - peripheral ( 40 - 50% centrality ) collisions .",
    "similar to what was observed for the @xmath0-integrated flows , the event plane correlations between the @xmath0-differential flows increase with impact parameter from central to semi - peripheral collisions .",
    "shear viscosity increases the strength of the event - plane correlation as previously found by yan @xcite and qiu @xcite for @xmath0- integrated flows .",
    "the shear viscous strengthening of the correlations is relatively more pronounced in central than in more peripheral collisions , but it appears to disappear at higher @xmath0 values . at low @xmath0 ,",
    "the differential event plane correlations are much weaker than those of the integrated flows and almost negligible .",
    "increasing with @xmath0 , the differential event plane correlations become approximately equal to those of the integrated flows around @xmath31 gev/@xmath13 ; at even larger @xmath0 , however , for viscous evolution the @xmath0-differential correlations drop below the @xmath0-integrated values , indicating that the viscous strengthening of the event - plane correlations operates only at thermal transverse momenta and disappears for harder @xmath0 .",
    "the differences between differential and integrated event plane correlations can to a large extent be explained as a consequence of the decorrelation between the flow angles at different @xmath0-values .",
    "as noted in @xcite , in general the flow angle @xmath6 depend on @xmath0 and , as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath32 wanders around the ` average angle ' @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath0-averaged event - plane correlator thus closely represents the @xmath0-differential one only in the @xmath0-region in which the majority of particles are emitted . at small @xmath0 ,",
    "the variance @xmath33 is quite large for all @xmath7 due to the fluctuating @xmath32 .",
    "this is the likely reason for the much weaker event - plane correlations of the @xmath0-differential flows at small @xmath0 compared to the @xmath0-averaged ones : at small @xmath0 , the directions of the complex flow vectors are almost uncorrelated @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we will mostly ignore the low-@xmath0 region in the rest of the paper .",
    "there are mainly two ways to describe the correlations between flow magnitudes : one way is to study the correlation between @xmath34 and @xmath5 via the event - shape selection method , suggested by the atlas collaboration @xcite and already tested with the hydrodynamic model @xcite .",
    "the other way is using the symmetric 2-harmonic 4-particle cumulant ( or moment ) @xmath35 to evaluate the correlation between @xmath34 and @xmath5 , suggested by the alice collaboration @xcite and tested with hydrodynamic , transport and hybrid models .",
    "in particular , the authors of @xcite studied the @xmath0 dependence of the normalized correlators @xmath35 , ie .",
    "@xmath36 , between the magnitudes of the differential flows @xmath37 and @xmath38 at 20 - 30% centrality with the vish2 + 1 and ampt models . they found that for both models , @xmath39 and @xmath40 change sign from negative to positive with increasing @xmath0 around at @xmath41gev/@xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , niemi and collaborators studied the linear correlation coefficient @xmath42 of the differential flows @xmath37 and @xmath38 as a function of transverse momentum for 20 - 30% au+au collisions at @xmath43 gev with the hydrodynamic model @xcite . in their calculation , @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "also exhibit a sign change with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "however , they argued that at 20 - 30% centrality , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are not linearly correlated since @xmath48 .",
    "they also suggested that the differential @xmath49 is sensitive to shear viscosity and decoupling temperature and is strongly affected by @xmath50 in the initial state .    in this paper",
    ", we use the event - shape selection method to study the correlations between differential flows @xcite .",
    "building on previous work reported in @xcite , 42000 hydrodynamically generated events were divided into 14 equal centrality classes according to multiplicity , then ordered by @xmath51 and subdivided by percentile into 6 bins per centrality class ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) where @xmath54 ( with @xmath55 ) . the differential flow magnitude is calculated as @xmath56 ; here @xmath5 is @xmath7-th order integrated flow coefficient and @xmath57 denotes the average over events in one @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 ) bin .    before discussing the correlations between the differential flow magnitudes further",
    "we would like to emphasize that the event shape selection based on @xmath51 yields equivalent event classes for different @xmath0 ranges . as seen in fig .",
    "6 in @xcite for @xmath60 and 3 , @xmath5 for the range @xmath61 gev shows approximate linearity with @xmath5 in the range @xmath62 gev , for different @xmath51 bins and in all centrality classes .        fig .",

    "the solid black circles connected by dotted lines are the @xmath0-integrated @xmath63 correlations for comparison .    since the differential @xmath34 and @xmath5 all increase with @xmath0 in the @xmath0 ranges shown here , and the integrated flows are the yield - weighted averages of the differential flows , the @xmath0-integrated black lines are in the middle of the colored lines representing @xmath0-differential correlations .",

    "@xmath73 and @xmath74 are both positive . using @xmath58 or @xmath59 in the event - shape selection",
    "leads to some differences in the fitted parameters for @xmath66 .",
    "the new information from the @xmath0-differential analysis is that @xmath70 increases while @xmath68 decreases with increasing @xmath0 , for all @xmath7 .",
    "this means that , as @xmath0 increases , the linear contribution @xmath75 increases in sync with @xmath38 whereas the strength of the non - linear mode coupling described by @xmath76 decreases .",
    "another interesting observation is that @xmath73 and @xmath74 of the @xmath0-integrated flows are larger than those of the @xmath0-differential flows , in all @xmath0 ranges and at all collision centralities .",
    "we will discuss this further in the next section .",

    "<S> a systematic analysis of correlations between different orders of @xmath0-differential flow is presented , including mode coupling effects in flow vectors , correlations between flow angles ( a.k.a . </S>",
    "<S> event - plane correlations ) , and correlations between flow magnitudes , all of which were previously studied with integrated flows . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mode coupling effects among differential flows largely mirror those among the corresponding integrated flows , except at small transverse momenta where mode coupling contributions are small . </S>",
    "<S> for the fourth- and fifth - order flow vectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 we argue that the event plane correlations can be understood as the ratio between the mode coupling contributions to these flows and and the flow magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that for @xmath1 and @xmath2 the linear response contribution scales linearly with the corresponding cumulant - defined eccentricities but not with the standard eccentricities . </S>"
