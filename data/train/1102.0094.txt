    "the einstein field equation has two parameters - the gravitational constant @xmath0 and the cosmological constant @xmath1 . the newtonian constant of gravitation @xmath0 plays the role of a coupling constant between geometry and matter in the einstein field equations . in an evolving universe",
    ", it appears natural to look at this `` constant '' as a function of time .",
    "numerous suggestions based on different arguments have been proposed in the past few decades in which @xmath0 varies with time [ 1 ] .",
    "dirac [ 2 ] proposed a theory with variable @xmath0 motivated by the occurrence of large numbers discovered by weyl , eddington and dirac himself .",
    "many other extensions of einstein s theory with time dependent @xmath0 have also been proposed in order to achieve a possible unification of gravitation and elementary particle physics or to incorporate mach s principle in general relativity [ 3 ] .",
    "+ from the point of view of incorporating particle physics into einstein s theory of gravitation , the simplest approach is to interpret the cosmological constant @xmath1 in terms of quantum mechanics and the physics of vacuum [ 4 ] .",
    "the @xmath1 term has also been interpreted in terms of the higgs scalar field [ 5 ] .",
    "linde [ 6 ] proposed that @xmath1 is a function of temperature and related it to the process of broken symmetries .",
    "gaspirini [ 7 ] in this regard argues that @xmath1 can also be interpreted as a measure of temperature of a vacuum which should decrease like the radiation temperature with cosmic acceleration . by considering the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor of matter and vacuum",
    "take together , many authors have invoked the idea of a decreasing vacuum energy and hence a varying cosmological constant @xmath1 with cosmic expansion in the frame work of einstein s theory .",
    "+ @xmath1 as a function of time has also been considered by several authors in various variable @xmath0 theories in different contexts [ 8 ] . investigating the distance dependence of gravity under very general conditions , wilkins [ 9 ] found that the gravity field at a distance @xmath2 from a point mass has two components : one varying as @xmath3 , the other as @xmath2 ( hookian field ) .",
    "the latter component is identifiable with the weak field limit of the @xmath1 term in einstein s equation .",
    "his analysis allows one to consider both the gravity fields - the hookian field , coupled to @xmath1 and the newtonian one coupled to @xmath0 - on an equal footing . with this in view , several authors [ 10 , 11 ] have proposed linking the variation of @xmath0 with that of @xmath1 in the framework of general relativity .",
    "this approach preserves conservation of the energy - momentum tensor of matter and leaves the form of the einstein field equations unchanged .",
    "though this approach is non - covariant , it is worth studying because it may be a limit of some higher dimensional fully covariant theory [ 10 , 12 ] .",
    "+ recent observations of the luminosity of type ia supernovae indicate [ 13 , 14 ] an accelerated expansion of the universe and lead to the search for a new type of matter which violates the strong energy condition i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "the matter consent responsible for such a condition to be satisfied at a certain stage of evolution of the universe is referred to as a _",
    "dark energy_. there are different candidates to play the role of the dark energy .",
    "the type of dark energy represented by a scalar field is often called quintessence . the simplest candidate for dark energy",
    "is cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "in particular one can try another type of dark energy , the so - called chaplygin gas which obeys an equation of state like [ 15 ] @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the pressure and energy density .",
    "subsequently the above equation was generalized to the form [ 16 ] @xmath8 .",
    "there are some works on modified chapligin gas obeying equation of state [ 17 , 18 ]    @xmath9    at all stages it shows a mixture .",
    "this is described from radiation era to @xmath1cdm model .",

    "+ the energy - momentum tensor for perfect fluid is    @xmath12    where @xmath7 and @xmath6 are energy density and isotropic pressure respectively and @xmath13 .",
    "+ the einstein field equations with variable @xmath0 and @xmath1 is given by    @xmath14    i.e. , we have two equations as    @xmath15    and @xmath16    from ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) we have    @xmath17    we assume the law of conservation of energy ( @xmath18 ) giving    @xmath19    from ( 7 ) and ( 8) we have    @xmath20    this implies @xmath21 or @xmath22 according as @xmath23 or @xmath24 i.e. , @xmath0 increases or decreases according to whether @xmath1 decreases or increases .",
