    "one of the main goals in the study of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhic ) is to understand the conditions realized in the center of such a collision .",
    "if the created system is sufficiently thermalized , one can in principle link measurements with information coming from lattice simulations about the equation of state ( eos ) of hot qcd matter ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , in order to make use of the eos , some information on the spatial expansion pattern of the matter is extremely helpful .",
    "hbt correlation measurements can provide at least part of this information ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "however , such measurements can only reveal the correlation lengths of the source , which result from a complex interplay of temperature , flow pattern and true geometrical shape .",
    "commonly , simple ( often gaussian ) parameterizations of the emission source are used to interpret the experimental information and extract the geometrical ( gaussian ) radius of the source @xmath4 , its transverse expansion velocity @xmath5 , from the longitudinal correlation radius @xmath6 the source lifetime @xmath7 and from @xmath8 its emission duration @xmath9 . in @xcite",
    "( discussing hbt measurements of pb - pb collisions at sps ) , these parameters are found to be @xmath10 fm , @xmath11 fm/@xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 fm/@xmath12 for an assumed temperature at breakup of @xmath15 mev .",
    "these numbers point to a rather rapidly expanding and decaying system .",
    "however , there is a subtle problem with this interpretation : if the system expands from a root mean sqare radius @xmath16 of about @xmath17 fm ( as found by a calculation of the overlap of the colliding nuclei ) to the measured @xmath16 of about @xmath18 fm ( assuming @xmath19 fm ) , while at the same time the fireball front ( for a gaussian distribution , take e.g. @xmath16 for the front ) expands to a velocity of @xmath20 , we may expect the following equations to approximate the problem @xcite : @xmath21 solving for @xmath22 and @xmath7 we find @xmath23 fm / c , clearly incompatible with the lifetime extracted from @xmath6 .",
    "what is wrong here ?    in @xcite , it has been pointed out that the relation @xcite @xmath24 ( with transverse mass @xmath25 and @xmath26 the transverse momentum of a particle with mass @xmath27 ) linking the measured @xmath6 and @xmath7 is based on a backwards extrapolation of the measured freeze - out state , assuming that the longitudinal expansion takes place with the same velocity at all times before @xmath7 . however , this relation ceases to hold if the system undergoes accelerated longitudinal expansion also ( in this case , the lifetime can be significantly longer than extracted from ( [ e - sinyukov ] ) ) , so the estimate done from the transverse dynamics is probably more reliable .",
    "this , however , immediately gives rise to the following question : if a thermal source expands for @xmath28 fm / c , how can it be that its apparent emission duration is only @xmath29 fm / c ? in order to answer this question , one needs to specify the space - time evolution of the source beyond the schematic parameterization used in @xcite .",
    "we will employ a description of this evolution based on bulk thermodynamic properties of the fireball to investigate this question .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after an introduction to the fireball expansion model , we discuss in greater detail why longitudinal acceleration helps to match the timescales extracted from @xmath6 and @xmath2 . then we specify how this model is used to calculate the relevant hbt parameters .",
    "we subsequently compare the results to the measured data and explicitly demonstrate the differences to the standard parameterizations .",
    "then we discuss the modifications to our scenario which are required to obtain good agreement with the data .",
    "finally we investigate the physics behind the observed long fireball lifetime and the small difference between @xmath1 and @xmath2 and discuss the impact of the modifications introduced before to previous results obtained within the same framework .",
    "in this section , we briefly outline the general framework of the fireball evolution model which we use in the following as a starting point for the calculation of hadron emission and ultimately the calculation of hbt radius parameters .",
    "our fundamental assumption is to treat the fireball matter as thermalized from an initial proper time scale @xmath30 until breakup time @xmath7 . for simplicity , we assume a spatially homogeneous distribution of matter . since some volume elements move with relativistic velocities , it is sensible to choose volumes corresponding to a given proper time @xmath31 for the calculation of thermodynamics , hence the thermodynamic parameters temperature @xmath32 , entropy density @xmath33 , pressure @xmath34 , chemical potentials @xmath35 and energy density @xmath36 become functions of @xmath31 only for such a system . in the following ,",
    "we refer to @xmath31 as the time measured in a frame co - moving with a given volume element .    in order to make use of the information coming from lattice qcd calculations , we proceed by calculating the thermodynamical response to a volume expansion that is parametrized in such a way as to reproduce the experimental information about the flow pattern and hbt correlations as closely as possible .    as a further simplification",
    ", we assume the volume to be cylindrically symmetric around the beam ( z)-axis . thus , the volume is characterized by the longitudinal extension @xmath37 and the transverse radius @xmath38 and we find @xmath39    in order to account for collective flow effects , we boost individual volume elements according to a position - dependent velocity field . for the transverse flow",
    ", we make the ansatz @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the root mean square radius of the fireball at @xmath31 and @xmath42 the transverse rapidity at @xmath16 .    for the longitudinal dynamics , we start with the experimentally measured width of the rapidity interval of observed hadrons @xmath43 at breakup . from this , we compute the longitudinal velocity of the fireball front at kinetic freeze - out @xmath44 .",
    "we do not require the initial expansion velocity @xmath45 to coincide with @xmath44 but instead allow for a longitudinally accelerated expansion .",
    "this implies that during the evolution @xmath46 is not valid ( with @xmath47 and @xmath48 the spacetime rapidity @xmath49 ) in contrast to the non - accelerated case .",
    "the requirement that the acceleration should be a function of @xmath31 and that the system stays spatially homogeneous for all @xmath31 determines the velocity field uniquely once the motion of the front is specified .",
    "we solve the resulting equations numerically @xcite and find that for not too large rapidities @xmath50 and accelerations volume elements approximately fall on curves @xmath51 and that the flow pattern can be approximated by a linear relationship between rapidity @xmath52 and spacetime rapidity @xmath48 as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the rapidity of the cylinder front . in this case , the longitudinal extension can be found calculating the invariant volume @xmath56 as @xmath57 with @xmath58 the spacetime rapidity of the cylinder front .",
    "this is an approximate generalization of the boost - invariant relation @xmath59 which can be derived for non - accelerated motion .",
    "a more detailed description of the expansion can be found in @xcite .      in order to proceed , we have to specify the longitudinal acceleration @xmath60 at the fireball front ( which in turn is used to calculate @xmath58 numerically ) , the initial front velocity @xmath45 and the expansion of the radius @xmath38 in proper time .",
    "we make the ansatz @xmath61 which allows a soft point in the eos where the ratio @xmath62 gets small to influence the acceleration pattern . @xmath63 and @xmath45 are model parameters governing the longitudinal expansion and fit to data .    since typically longitudinal expansion is characterized by larger velocities than transverse expansion , i.e. @xmath64 , we treat the radial expansion non - relativistically .",
    "we assume that the radius of the cylinder can be written as @xmath65    the initial radius @xmath66 is taken from overlap calculations .",
    "this leaves a parameter @xmath67 determining the strength of transverse acceleration which is also fit to data .",
    "the final parameter characterizing the expansion is its endpoint given by @xmath7 , the breakup proper time of the system .",
    "we assume that entropy is conserved throughout the thermalized expansion phase .",
    "therefore , we start by fixing the entropy per baryon from the number of produced particles per unit rapidity ( see e.g. @xcite ) . calculating the number of participant baryons ( see @xcite ) we find the total entropy @xmath68 . the entropy density at a given proper time is then determined by @xmath69 .",
    "we describe the eos in the partonic phase by a quasiparticle interpretation of lattice data which has been shown to reproduce lattice results both at vanishing baryochemical potential @xmath70 and finite @xmath70 @xcite ( see these references for details of the model ) .",
    "in the hadron gas phase , we calculate thermodynamic properties at kinetic decoupling where interactions cease to be important . here , we have reason to expect that an ideal gas will be a good description . determining the eos at this point",
    ", we choose a smooth interpolation from here to the eos obtained in the quasiparticle description .",
    "this is described in greater detail in @xcite .    with the help of the eos and @xmath71 ,",
    "we are now in a position to compute the parameters @xmath72 as well .",
    "since the ratio @xmath73 appear in the expansion parametrization , we have to solve the model self - consistently .      in order to adjust the model parameters , we compare with data on transverse momentum spectra and hbt correlation measurements . in @xcite ,",
    "a similar model is fit to a large set of experimental data , providing sets of parameters @xmath74 at freeze - out .",
    "although the present model uses a different ( box vs. gaussian ) longitudinal distribution of matter , we use the parameters from this analysis as a guideline for the transverse dynamics where this difference should not show up and determine @xmath75 separately .",
    "specifically , we use the set * b1 * from @xcite for the transverse dynamics .    by requiring @xmath76 and @xmath77",
    "we can determine the model parameters @xmath67 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath63 is fixed by the requirement @xmath78 .",
    "the remaining parameter @xmath45 now determines the volume ( and hence temperature ) at freeze - out and can be adjusted such that @xmath79 .",
    "the model for 5% central 158 agev pb - pb collisions at sps is characterized by the following scales : initial long .",
    "expansion velocity @xmath80 , thermalization time @xmath81 fm / c , initial temperature @xmath82 mev , duration of the qgp phase @xmath83 fm / c , duration of the hadronic phase @xmath84 fm / c , total lifetime @xmath85 fm / c , r.m.s radius at freeze - out @xmath86 fm , transverse expansion velocity @xmath87 .",
    "we have chosen the above model framework in such a way that it allows to account for the apparent mismatch in timescales derived from eqs .",
    "( [ e - tside ] ) and ( [ e - sinyukov ] ) .",
    "this is done by allowing for initial compression of the matter in longitudinal direction and subsequent re - expansion .",
    "the longitudinal flow pattern of matter is schematically indicated in fig .",
    "[ f - expansion ] .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that a measurement of the conditions around the freeze - out hypersurface @xmath88 ( where the bulk of hadronic emission takes place ) would not be able to distinguish between an accelerated or non - accelerated longitudinal evolution history .",
    "this has also been pointed out in @xcite .",
    "hence , incorporating accelerated longitudinal expansion we have the freedom to select @xmath7 accoring to eq .",
    "( [ e - tside ] ) without being in contradiction with ( [ e - sinyukov ] ) .",
    "( since we in practice adjust the model to @xmath6 and the observed multiplicity distribution in rapidity , a detailed discussion of @xmath6 in this paper is not fruitful ) .    in our model ,",
    "the parameter controlling the initial amount of compression is @xmath80 .",
    "this has profound consequences for the initial state : if we set @xmath89 ( and hence use the scenario underlying eq .",
    "( [ e - sinyukov ] ) ) , the initial temperature of the fireball drops by @xmath90% .",
    "this in turn has consequences for the emission of real photons .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that a scenario very similar to the one discussed here can account for the measured amount of photon emission , especially in the momentum region between 2 and 2.5 gev where no significant prompt photon contribution is expected . assuming a scenario without longitudinal acceleration , the yield of direct photons at 2 gev drops by a factor 8 for the standard choice of the equilibration time of @xmath91 fm / c in striking disagreement with tha data .",
    "this can not fully be compensated even for a choice of the equilibration time as low as 0.1 fm / c .    in conclusion , the longitudinally",
    "accelerated pattern advocated earlier to explain the difference between the timescales extracted from ( [ e - tside ] ) and ( [ e - sinyukov ] ) is strongly favoured by the direct photon data .",
    "therefore , we will assume in the following that the relevant timescale of the fireball evolution can be inferred from transverse dynamics only and focus on the remaining question of the apparent mismatch of the source evolution time @xmath28 fm / c and its emission duration @xmath29 fm / c . in order to investigate this",
    ", we have to specify the emission function of the fireball .",
    "one contribution to the total emission of particles from the fireball comes from the final breakup of the thermalized system .",
    "the corresponding freeze - out hypersurface is characterized by a timelike normal .",
    "we calculate particle emission from this phase with the help of the emission function    @xmath92    in this expression , the momentum @xmath93 is parametrized in terms of longitudinal rapidity @xmath94 , transverse mass @xmath95 and transverse momentum @xmath96 the factor @xmath97 corresponds to the thermal distribution of particle species @xmath98 ( with corresponding chemical potential @xmath35 and mass @xmath99 ) where the product @xmath100 takes care of evaluating the distribution in the rest frame of matter moving with four - velocity @xmath101 as seen from a particle with momentum @xmath93 and the @xmath102 sign holds for fermions ( bosons ) . @xmath103 and @xmath104 describe the distribution of matter in radial and longitudinal direction using the radius @xmath105 and spacetime rapidity @xmath48 .",
    "finally , the factor @xmath106 can be seen as a smearing of a sudden decoupling occuring at proper time @xmath7 into an extended breakup time period characterized by @xmath9 .",
    "the single particle spectrum for particle species @xmath98 is calculated from this emission function as    @xmath107    with @xmath108 .",

    "the transverse correlation radii @xmath113 follow from the emission function as @xmath114 @xmath115 with @xmath116 the transverse velocity of the emitted pair , @xmath117 and @xmath118 an average with the emission function .    in @xcite , expressions ( [ e - singlespectrumbase ] ) , ( [ ersidebase ] ) and ( [ eroutbase ] )",

    ", we assume a box profile @xmath121 for the radial distribution of thermalized matter .",
    "we use @xmath122 throughout this paper .",
    "in addition to particle emission at the final breakup of the fireball described by ( [ e - timelikeemission ] ) , there is also continuous emission of particles throughout the whole lifetime of the system .",
    "such emission is characterized by a freeze - out hypersurface with spacelike normal .    since the correlation radius @xmath1 probes not only the geometrical radius of the source , but also the duration of particle emission ( see eq .",
    "( [ eroutbase ] ) ) , it may well be that such a contribution significantly change the ratio @xmath8 ( which is known to be small experimentally ) as compared to the use of only the emission function ( [ e - timelikeemission ] ) .    in order to investigate this question ,",
    "we consider in addition to ( [ e - timelikeemission ] ) also the emission function    @xmath123    which describes the emission of particles with transverse velocity @xmath124 from the fireball surface moving at @xmath5 ( with @xmath125 the angle between surface and the momentum vector of the emitted particle ) at @xmath126 between the space - time rapidity extent of the fireball from @xmath127 to @xmath128 between initial time @xmath129 and freeze - out time @xmath7 .",
    "the factor @xmath130 ensures that emission only takes place for particles moving faster than the emission surface and no negative contribution of backward emission are counted .",
    "we assume that the expanding fireball can be described as a hot core and a ( thin ) boundary region from which the emission takes place .",
    "this region is assumed to be characterized by an average temperature @xmath131 .",
    "we do not require @xmath132 , but leave this as a free parameter , however we do require that the boundary is characterized by the same pion density as the whole fireball at breakup , which fixes @xmath133 for given @xmath131 .    to a first approximation , we describe the total particle emission by the sum of both emission throughout lifetime and final breakup as @xmath134 .",
    "the experimental results for the correlation radius @xmath2 are often fit by a function of the form    @xmath135    this expression comes from an approach where only the final breakup of the fireball is taken into account , the matter distribution @xmath103 is assumed to be gaussian with width @xmath136 , and boltzmann statistics instead of bose - einstein statistics is used .",
    "in contrast , in this paper we study a model with a long duration of the emission ( throghout the complete fireball lifetime of @xmath137 fm / c ) , and a final breakup , which is characterized rather by a box - shaped transverse distribution .",
    "in addition , we use the bose - einstein ( fermi - dirac ) distribution where appropriate .",
    "evidently , the analytic expression ( [ e - r_side_simple ] ) is only able to determine the ratio @xmath138 . assuming @xmath15 mev , the fit yields @xmath139 fm corresponding to @xmath140 fm and @xmath141 for the most central collisions at 158 agev @xcite .",
    "( compare with the parameters in our fireball evolution scenario @xmath142 mev , @xmath143 and @xmath144 fm . )    for the sake of clarity , we start by presenting the result of evaluating ( [ ersidebase ] ) using @xmath145 only , i.e. we neglect all emission throughout the fireball lifetime .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - box_vs_gauss ] .    clearly , the overall normalization ( set by the @xmath16 radius ) appears too small in the model and the falloff with transverse pair momentum @xmath96 too steep .",
    "the latter effect can be explained by the observation that the gaussian distribution allows for a ( small ) component of the total amount of matter to be at large radii and hence to be boosted with large radial velocities if a flow profile as in eq .",
    "( [ e - flowprofile ] ) is chosen , whereas the box profile used in the present scenario does not .",
    "this discrepancy is significantly reduced by using the full emission function @xmath146 instead of @xmath145 .",
    "this is due to the fact that emission of fast particles is preferred for a freeze - out hypersurface with spacelike normal , leading to an enhancement of the correlation radii at larger @xmath96 also ( fig .",
    "[ f - box_vs_gauss ] , right panel ) .",
    "in addition , we have some freedom to adjust @xmath131 ( the average temperature of the emitting region in @xmath147 ) within reasonable limits .",
    "the data prefer a rather large value @xmath148 mev .",
    "this should not come as a surprise , since the temperature of the emitting layer may well be large in the initial stages of fireball evolution .",
    "guided by the success of the gaussian parametrization , we drop the unphysically sharp cutoff of the box profile @xmath149 and use instead a woods - saxon distribution ( retaining the value of @xmath150 mev in the following )    @xmath151}\\ ] ]    we find that the data prefer rather small values of @xmath152 of the order of @xmath153 fm ( see fig .",
    "[ f - ws ] , left panel ) .",
    "this is reassuring since it gives some justification for the use of a box profile in the calculation of dilepton and photon emission .",
    "finally , we also calculate the model - independent corrections @xcite to ( [ ersidebase ] )    @xmath154    which primarily affect the low momentum region .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - ws ] , right panel .",
    "these corrections are small , however , they tend to improve agreement with data slightly in the low @xmath96 region .    in summary , including the emission throughout the fireball lifetime and all correction terms , we achieve a good description of the experimental data",
    ".      it is commonly deduced from ( [ ersidebase ] ) and ( [ eroutbase ] ) that the duration of pion emission can be calculated as @xmath155 with @xmath156 the velocity of the emitted pair @xmath157 . however , there are in fact two different timescales related to the duration of the emission in our model : a ) the total lifetime of the fireball of order @xmath137 fm / c and b ) the duration of the final breakup , which is a priori unknown , but can be expected to be of order of at most a few fm / c for the whole evolution scenario to make sense .",
    "we therefore expect the actual difference between @xmath1 and @xmath2 in our model to be characterized by a mixture of these two scales , weighted with their respective contribution to the total pion emission .",
    "we start the investigation of @xmath1 by fixing all parameters at the value used to describe @xmath2 and evaluating ( [ eroutbase ] ) with different values of @xmath158 , the final breakup duration . in all following calculations",
    ", we also include the correction term for @xmath1 @xcite @xmath159 the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - r_out_dt ] .    clearly , the overall magnitude of the calculated @xmath1 is in agreement with data , provided that a rather sudden breakup time of the order of 13 fm / c is choosen .",
    "this indicates that that the difference @xmath160 does not reflect the full fireball lifetime @xmath161 but rather is dominantly influenced by @xmath9 only ( otherwise one would expect the difference to be significantly larger ) .",
    "we will argue later on that this is so because the numerical contribtion from continuous emission throughout the fireball lifetime is small compared to the contribution from final breakup .",
    "the shape of the falloff with @xmath96 , however , is not well reproduced for any choice of @xmath9 .",
    "( in fact , the shape appears similar to the falloff of @xmath2 and rather insensitive to variations of @xmath9 . )",
    "this suggests that the data ( albeit the systematic errors are rather large ) indicate the need for a more refined freeze - out scenario .    in @xcite ,",
    "such a more detailed scenario based on the ( momentum - dependent ) mean free path of pions inside the hot matter is described .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the present paper to show that this freeze - out criterion is able to describe the data , however , we will argue that it leads to the correct qualitative behaviour of the calculated @xmath1 .    the essential observation made in @xcite ist that the freeze - out is different for high momentum pions than for low momentum pions : high momentum pions",
    "are expected to escape earlier .",
    "if we want to incorporate this into our calculation , we have to make either @xmath9 or @xmath7 ( or both ) dependent on @xmath96 , the idea being that the final breakup of the fireball occurs earlier for high momentum pions and happens faster .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ f - r_out_dt ] , we demonstrate that the dependence of @xmath9 is able to qualitatively improve the agreement with data . to obtain an estimate for the qualitative behaviour , we assume @xmath162 fm / c for @xmath163 mev and @xmath164 fm / c for @xmath165 mev and interpolate linearly inbetween . in view of the large systematic uncertainties , however",
    ", we do not push this idea further by trying to aim at a perfect description of the data .    as for the dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath96",
    ", we observe that earlier freeze - out leads in general to smaller @xmath1 at larger @xmath96 , since one probes a radially less expanded system .",
    "a suitable variation of @xmath9 might then be able to lead to a good description of the data .",
    "again , in view of the large uncertainties we refrain from a further examination of this scenario .",
    "the main result of the previous section is that @xmath1 does not seem to reflect the order of magnitude of the fireball lifetime @xmath7 , even if continuous emission of pions is taken into account .",
    "this is a rather surprising result , and in this section we will investigate the relevant emission function @xmath166 further in order to answer the following questions :    * why is @xmath9 and not @xmath7 the dominant timescale in @xmath1 ? * does the continuous loss of pions ( and nucleons ) have any effect on the thermodynamics of the fireball ( and hence invalidate the findings of e.g. @xcite ) ?    in order to answer these questions , we investigate the transverse velocity distributions in the c.m .",
    "frame of pions and nucleons emitted before @xmath7 ( which can be easily calculated by integrating ( [ e - spacelikeemission ] ) over the fireball lifetime ) .",
    "the reason for choosing this particular distribution is the following : we may well imagine a process where a particle is emitted in the initial stage of the expansion .",
    "such particle can be emitted with relatively small velocity ( as seen in the c.m .",
    "frame ) , since the fireball initially does not expand in radial direction .",
    "if the emission velocity of such a particle is , however , smaller than the radial velocity of the fireball at @xmath7 , there is a chance that this already emitted particle re - enters the thermalized region .",
    "the condition reads : @xmath167 with emission time @xmath168 and emission velocity @xmath169 measured in the c.m .",
    "this condition is most easily implemented using the transverse velocity distribution of emitted particles .",
    "the resulting transverse velocity distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ f - dndv ] .",
    "several important observations can be made : for the emission of pions , the recapturing process is not very efficient .",
    "this is due to the fact that the mass of the pions is of order of the temperature of the emitting layer , hence the transverse velocity distribution is peaked towards large velocities where recapture can not take place . on the other hand ,",
    "the total number of pions emitted before the final breakup of the fireball is small as compared to the total number of observed @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "this explains partially the observed insensitivity of @xmath1 to the fireball lifetime .    turning to nucleons , we observe that the recapturing process is somewhat more efficient due to the large nucleon mass leading to reduced emission velocities . the total number of emitted nucleons , however , is also small as compared to the total number of participants ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "note in addition that most of the emission takes place close to @xmath7 anyway , since the area of the emitting surface grows strongly with time as the fireball expands and the total number of emitted particles per unit time is proportional to this area .",
    "this is enhanced by the fact that the fireball in this scenario undergoes accelerated expansion in both in longitudinal and transverse direction , thus the emitting surface is for the larger part of the evolution significantly smaller than its final value",
    ".    we can incorporate the early loss of pions schematically into the calculation of dilepton emission ( see @xcite)(the observable which is presumably most affected by this effect ) by lowering the value of the pion chemical potential @xmath173 during the hadronic evolution stage ( in @xcite , we assumed a linear rise with proper time of @xmath173 from 0 at the phase transition to a value consistent with the observed number of pions at thermal freeze - out .",
    "now , we choose the endpoint such that the number of pions from both continuous emission and final breakup agrees with the observed number .",
    "we find @xmath174 110 mev ) .",
    "the calculation reveals that the dilepton yield in the low invariant mass region between 300 and 700 mev is reduced by @xmath175 by the correction ( this is hardly visible in a logatithmic plot , therefore we do not show a graph ) . above 1 gev",
    "invariant mass , the dilepton yield is dominated by drell - yan pairs and emission from the hot qgp , consequently this domain remains almost unaltered be the correction .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that it is sufficient for the description of gross thermodynamical properties of the expanding matter to approximate the fireball as a closed system which does not emit strongly interacting partcles before @xmath7 .",
    "we have investigated the effect of particle emission prior to the fireball breakup time @xmath7 in a framework based on gross thermodynamic properties of hot qcd matter , which is nevertheless able to account for a large number of experimental observables and discussed the connection to the hbt parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    calculating the emission of pions from the fireball boundary and breakup",
    ", we computed @xmath1 and @xmath2 and compared to measurements by the ceres collaboration .",
    "we found that @xmath2 can be well decribed within the present framework .",
    "regarding @xmath1 , we identified two timescales which potentially enter this quantity , the fireball breakup time @xmath9 and the total lifetime @xmath7 .",
    "however , in the present framework , only @xmath9 was shown to significantly influence @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , we found that a momentum - independent freeze - out criterion does not provide the best description of the data .",
    "we argued qualitatively that a more refined criterion ( e.g. as suggested in @xcite ) improves the agreement with data .",
    "finally , we demonstrated that the scenario discussed here does not invalidate our previous results where we did not include the effects of continuous emission of particles from the thermalized matter .",

    "<S> the common interpretation of hbt data measured at top sps energies leads to apparent source lifetimes of 68 fm / c and emission duration of approximately 23 fm / c . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate a scenario with continuous pion emission from a long - lived ( @xmath0 16 fm / c ) thermalized source in order to show that it is not excluded by the data . starting from a description of the source s spacetime expansion based on gross thermodynamical properties of hot matter ( which is able to describe a number of experimental observables ) , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the pion emission function with a contribution from continuous emission during the source s lifetime and another contribution from the final breakup and proceed by calculating the hbt parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared with experimental data measured at sps for 158 agev central pb - pb collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we achieve agreement with data , provided that some minor modifications of the fireball evolution scenario are made and find that the parameter @xmath1 is not sensitive to the fireball lifetime , but only to the duration of the final breakup , in spite of the fact that emission takes place throughout the whole lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly demonstrate that those findings do not alter previous results obtained within this framework .     </S>",
