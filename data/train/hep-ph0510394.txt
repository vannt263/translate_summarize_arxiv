    "because the higgs boson predicted in the standard model(sm ) has not been found experimentally and the mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking(ewsb ) is still unknown , one believes that the sm is only an effective theory of the underlying theory at the tev energy scale . such underlying theory beyond the sm",
    "is called the new physics model .",
    "there are several candidates of new physics models(such as : the minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm ) , the technicolor ( tc)@xcite model , the top sea - saw model @xcite and extra dimensions model@xcite ) .",
    "one of the most important tasks of the future high energy colliders is to search for the higgs in the sm or to test the new physics models , furthermore , to reveal the mystery of electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism . in all case , it is likely that the lhc running in 2007 will see first signals of the mechanism at work .",
    "however , the complementary information from the linear colliders is needed to understand the underlying theory .",
    "several laboratories in the world have been working on the linear @xmath4 collider projects with an energy from several hundred gev up to several tev and the yearly expected luminosity being more like @xmath5 or a little more .",
    "these are nlc(usa)@xcite , jlc(japan)@xcite , tesla(europe)@xcite .",
    "the running of these high energy and luminosity linear colliders will open an unique window for us to understand the basic theory of particle physics .    as a dynamical breaking theory ,",
    "the technicolor(tc ) model was introduced by weinberg and susskind in the late 1970s@xcite , it can avoid the shortcomings of triviality and unnaturalness@xcite arising from the elementary higgs field . among the various tc models ,",
    "the topcolor - assisted technicolor model(tc2)@xcite is a more realistic one .",
    "one of the most general predictions of the tc2 model is the existence of three isospin - triplet pseudo goldstone bosons called top - pion(@xmath6,@xmath7 ) and an isospin - singlet boson called top - higgs(@xmath1 ) .",
    "these bosons can be regarded as the typical feature of the tc2 model .",
    "thus , study of the production mechanism of these typical particles can provide us the useful information to probe them at the future high - energy colliders .",
    "the discovery of these new particles can be regarded as the direct evidence to test the tc2 model .",
    "the new particles predicted by the tc2 model can be probed directly via its decay modes .",
    "the decay modes of the neutral top - pion are the tree - level decay processes @xmath8(if this is kinetically allowed ) , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the processes @xmath11 through an internal top quark loop",
    ". the branching ratios of these possible decay modes have been calculated in detail@xcite .",
    "the results show that the neutral top - pion almost decays to @xmath12 if the mass of neutral top - pion @xmath13 is larger than @xmath14 . if @xmath15 , the flavor - changing mode @xmath9 will become the dominant decay mode and the branching ratio can be over @xmath16 .",
    "such flavor - changing mode can play an important role in the search of the neutral top - pion due to the clean background . for the top - higgs ,",
    "the difference case is that there exist tree - level decay modes @xmath17 . for the charged top - pions ,",
    "its decay modes have been studied in reference @xcite .",
    "the main modes are the tree - level @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the alternative way to probe the top - pions and top - higgs is to study the production mechanism of these particles .",
    "recently , we have systematically studied some single top - pion production processes in the high energy @xmath4@xcite , @xmath20@xcite and @xmath21@xcite collisions . for the neutral top - pion",
    ", we found that the cross section of @xmath22 is over 10 fb , and the cross sections of the production modes @xmath23 in @xmath24 collision and @xmath25 in @xmath26 collision are at the level of a few fb . with the high luminosity at the planned linear colliders",
    ", the signals should be enough for us to observe the neutral top - pion .",
    "specially , with the large cross section , the process @xmath22 can not only give us more information about the tc2 model but also provide an unique way to distinguish the tc2 model from the sm and other new physics models . at @xmath4 colliders ,",
    "the main single charged top - pion production processes are @xmath27 and @xmath28 with the cross section at order of 10 fb for @xmath29 and a few fb for @xmath30 . because the sm predicts the existence of one neutral higgs boson , the distinguish of higgs - like neutral top - pion with the higgs in the sm need more precise measurement , but any observation of charged higgs or higgs - like particles will mean the signal of new physics .",
    "therefore , the probing of charged top - pions is more important to test the tc2 model . besides the single top - pion production mechanism discussed above , the pair productions @xmath31 and @xmath32 can occur at the tree - level in the @xmath4 collision .",
    "these pair productions might provide more typical information of the tc2 model via the multi - jets .",
    "for the heavy top - pions and top - higgs , such processes can only occur at the planned high energy colliders . in this paper , we study these pair production modes at the planned @xmath33 colliders .",
    "we find these two processes can provide enough number of distinct signals and the sm background can be efficiently reduced .",
    "these processes can provide a feasible way to test the tc2 model .",
    "as it is known , the @xmath34 , @xmath1 and @xmath35 look like the heavy @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 in two - higgs doublet model(2hdm ) , respectively . ,",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are very similar to that of @xmath34 , @xmath1 and @xmath35 . for example , like @xmath1 , @xmath37 can also be produced via @xmath39 and decay to @xmath40 . ] to distinguish the scalar in the tc2 model from the higgs sectors in the 2hdm , we need to point out what differnt features exist between them .",
    "model and the higgs sectors in the 2hdm .",
    "firstly , the yukawa couplings of top - pions and top - higgs to quarks are larger than these of higgs sectors which can make the signals of the tc2 model become more significant . secondly , in the tc2 model ,",
    "the couplings of top - pions to the three family fermions are non - universal and the top - pions and top - higgs have the large yukawa couplings to the third family , without the gim , there exist large flavor - changing couplings , such as : @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the flavor - changing processes in the tc2 model is very important for us to search for the scalars in the tc2 model and distinguish such scalars from the higgs sectors .",
    "thirdly , we find that there are some difference in the production between the scalars in the tc2 model and higgs sectors .",
    "for example , there exist flavor - changing production processes @xmath42 which can produce enough signals to observe the @xmath43 . such flavor - changing production processes for higgs sectors can be ignored due to the gim . on the other hand , due to the large yukawa couplings between @xmath7 and top quark , the loop - level @xmath44 become more important than the similar process @xmath45 . finally , there are also some difference in the decay modes between them .",
    "if @xmath12 mode is forbidden , with large branching ratio , @xmath46 become the main decay mode for @xmath7 and @xmath1 .",
    "but such decay mode does not exist for higgs sectors .",
    "it should also be noted that @xmath47 is an important decay mode for higgs sectors with large @xmath48 , but for the scalars in the tc2 model , such decay mode can be ignored due to the small coupling of scalars to @xmath47 .",
    "the above discusion can help us to distinguish the scalars in the tc2 model from the higgs sectors in 2hdm .",
    "the rest parts of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we firstly present a brief review of the tc2 model and then calculate the cross sections of the processes @xmath49 and @xmath3 .",
    "the numerical results are also discussed in section ii .",
    "the conclusions are given in section iii .",
    "the large top quark mass is suggestive of new dynamics associated with electroweak symmetry breaking . in order to solve the heavy top quark and the ewsb problems ,",
    "the topcolor model was proposed @xcite . in the topcolor model ,",
    "the top quark participates in a new strong interaction(topcolor ) which is spontaneously broken at some high energy scale @xmath51 .",
    "the strong dynamics leads to the formation of a condensate @xmath52 and gives rise to a large dynamical mass for top quark .",
    "if this top condensate is to be an adequate source of electroweak symmetry breaking , and at the same time , gives a reasonable top quark mass , the scale @xmath51 must be very high(@xmath53 gev ) .",
    "i.e. , the topcolor model suffers unnatural problem .",
    "another dynamical breaking theory , technicolor model , can solve the problem related to higgs field in the sm , but such theory has been unable to provide a natural and plausible understanding of why the top quark mass is so large .",
    "the tc2 model@xcite , incorporating the best features of the technicolor and topcolor , offers a new insight into possible mechanism of ewsb and the origin of heavy top quark mass . at ewsb scale , this model predicts two groups of scalars corresponding to the technicolor condensates and topcolor condensates , respectively .",
    "either of them can be arranged into a @xmath54 doublet@xcite , and their roles in tc2 model are quite analogous to the higgs fields in the model proposed in ref.@xcite which is a special two - higgs - doublet model in essence . explicitly speaking ,",
    "the doublet @xmath55 which corresponds to the topcolor condensates plays a minor role in ewsb and only couples to the third generation quarks , its main task is to generate the large top quark mass . while the doublet @xmath56 which corresponds to the technicolor condensates is mainly responsible for ewsb and light fermion masses , it also contributes a small portion of top quark mass . the vacuum expectation value(vev ) of the top quark pair condensate @xmath57 can be given by the pagel - stokar formula .",
    "for condensation around the ewsb scale of 1 tev , @xmath57 should be near 60 gev .",
    "once @xmath57 is fixed , the vev of the technifermion condensates , @xmath58 , is uniquely determined by the ewsb requirement @xmath59 . for @xmath60 gev , we must have @xmath61 gev .",
    "we linearize the theory and rearrange the pions in two orthogonal linear combinations to form the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the weak gauge bosons and a triplet of top - pions , @xmath0 , which become physical degrees of freedom .",
    "the top - pions are analogous to the neutral cp - odd and charged higgs scalars of two - higgs doublet model(2hdm ) .",
    "the theory loosely predicts top - pions to lie in the mass range of 200 gev . besides physical top - pions",
    ", there are another two cp - even higgs modes , labeled @xmath1 and @xmath62 , are known as the `` top - higgs '' boson and the `` techni - higgs '' bosons , respectively .",
    "their masses can be estimated in the nambu - jona - lasinio(njl ) model in the large @xmath63 approximation .",
    "for the top - higgs boson this is found to be on the order of @xmath64 ; for the techni - higgs boson it is much higher .",
    "however , it only serves as a rough guide . from the kinetic terms of the effective tc2 lagrangian in linearized form@xcite @xmath65 we know there exist tree - level couplings @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 which can induce the tree - level production processes @xmath69 and @xmath3 , but the cross section of such process is strongly depressed by the factor@xmath70 and heavy @xmath62 . on the other hand ,",
    "techni - higgs is not the typical particle of the tc2 model , so , we do not study this process in this paper . ] .",
    "these couplings can be written as : @xmath71 where , @xmath72 is the weinberg angle ) .      with the coupling @xmath66",
    ", the process @xmath73 can be induced at tree - level via @xmath74 exchanging .",
    "the feynman diagram of the process is shown in fig.1(a ) .",
    "the production amplitude of the process can be written directly : @xmath75 where , @xmath76 denotes the propagator of the particle , @xmath77 and @xmath78 denote the momenta of outcoming top - higgs and neutral top - pion , @xmath79 . with the above production amplitude ,",
    "we can directly obtain the production cross section of the process @xmath49 .    to obtain numerical results of the cross section , we fixed the input parameters as : @xmath80 gev , @xmath81 , @xmath60 gev , the mass of top - higgs @xmath82 gev(@xmath83 ) .",
    "the electromagnetic fine - structure constant @xmath84 at a certain energy scale is calculated from the simple qed one - loop evolution with the boundary value @xmath85 .",
    "although the theory predicts top - pions to lie in the mass range of 200 gev , this can be only regarded as a rough guide . in order to give a general prediction",
    ", we expand the mass range to 150 - 400 gev . to show the influence of the center of mass energy(@xmath86 ) on the cross section , we take @xmath87 gev",
    ", respectively(@xmath86=500 is too small to produce @xmath31 ) .",
    "the numerical results of the cross section are shown in fig 2 .",
    "the plots show that the cross section decreases with @xmath13 due to the phase space depression and falls more sharply for @xmath88 gev .",
    "the cross section is not sensitive to @xmath13 when @xmath89 gev .",
    "the change of the cross section with @xmath86 is not monotonous because the influence of @xmath86 on the phase space and z - propagator is inverse . in general",
    ", the production rate is at the level of a few fb .",
    "we find that @xmath88 gev is an ideal energy to probe light top - pion .",
    "for the light top - pion , the production rate can be near 10 fb in the case of @xmath88 . with yearly expected luminosity about @xmath5 ,",
    "there are @xmath90 @xmath31 signals can be produced after several running of @xmath4 colliders .",
    "as has been discussed , the possible decay modes of @xmath7 are the tree - level decay modes : @xmath91(if @xmath92 ) , @xmath46 , @xmath93 and loop - level decay modes : @xmath94 , @xmath20 , @xmath95 .",
    "as it is known , the couplings of top - pion to the three generation fermions are non - universal and therefore do not possess a glashow - iliopoulos - maiani(gim ) mechanism , this non - universal feature results in a large flavor - changing coupling @xmath96 .",
    "so , in the case of light @xmath7 , the main decay mode should be @xmath97 . in the sm ,",
    "the cross section of the process with @xmath98 production is strongly depressed by gim mechanism .",
    "therefore , @xmath97 might provide the typical signals of the tc2 model . with @xmath64",
    ", the main decay modes of top - higgs should be tree - level modes @xmath46,@xmath99 and @xmath100(@xmath101 might be forbidden or its decay width is very small when @xmath102 is near @xmath14 ) . with above discussion , we know that the most interesting signals of the @xmath31 production should be the four quark flavor - changing jets : @xmath103 which can provide distinct signals to identify the @xmath31 production with the large production rate and clean sm background are very small due to the gim mechanism . ] . on the other hand , @xmath69 can produce a large number of @xmath104 which can also be produced via @xmath105 in the 2hdm , but the different pole structure make it possible for us to distinguish them , the pole structure can be easily detected at the @xmath4 colliders .",
    "this means that reconstructing the neutral top - pion from @xmath46 will be important both as a means for measuring the mass of top - pion and also as a means for identifying the neutral scalars via flavor - changing @xmath46 jet .    in the 2hdm",
    ", there exists a similar process @xmath106 . to distinguish the scalars in the tc2 model from the higgs in the 2hdm via @xmath69 , we should compare the cross sections of @xmath69 and @xmath106 .",
    "the process @xmath106 has been studied in reference@xcite .",
    "we find the the cross section behavior of @xmath106 is similar to that of @xmath69 .",
    "the cross sections values of such two processes are not significantly different for the same parameters .",
    "for example , @xmath107 for @xmath87 gev and @xmath108 gev , @xmath109 for @xmath87 gev and @xmath110 gev .",
    "we should distinguish the neutral @xmath111 depending on their different feature of decay modes and pole structure .",
    "@xmath112 can provide the typical signals of the tc2 model . for neutral higgs boson ,",
    "@xmath113 are important decay modes , specially for large @xmath114 , but the decay modes @xmath47 can be ignored and @xmath115 does not exist for @xmath111 . on the other hand , the neutral higgs boson can decay to supersymmetric particles and there are not similar decay modes for @xmath111 .      the charged top - pion pair @xmath32 can be produced in @xmath4 annihilation via virtual @xmath116 or @xmath74 exchanging as shown in figs.1(b ) .",
    "such process is very important in searching for the charged top - pions because it can produce the distinct signals of the charged top - pions .",
    "the production amplitudes are : @xmath117 @xmath118    we ignore the electroweak contribution to the masses of charged top - pions and take @xmath119 .",
    "the cross section of @xmath3 is shown in fig.3 .",
    "it is shown that the behavior of the cross section plots of @xmath3 versus @xmath13 is similar to that of @xmath69 . for @xmath120 gev , the cross section falls sharply to a very small rate with @xmath13 increasing .",
    "so , the energy 500 gev is not suitable to search for the heavy charged top - pion pair . in the most case ,",
    "the cross section is at the order of tens fb which is significantly larger than that of @xmath73(the process @xmath3 includes an extra @xmath121propagator contribution ) .",
    "such production rate corresponds about @xmath122 @xmath32 pairs with the luminosity @xmath123 .",
    "this abundant production allows to enforce tight requirements on the event pre - selection and the mass reconstruction .",
    "the most promising decay modes to search for the charged top - pions are @xmath124 and the flavor - changing mode @xmath125 . in the case of @xmath124 ,",
    "the signals of the charged top - pion pair production is @xmath126 . in order to efficiently distinguish the signals from the underlying backgrounds and to measure the top - pion mass ,",
    "it is important to obtain a clean charged top - pion signal in the mass distribution of the multi - jet final states . to identify the production mode @xmath126",
    ", we insist on 8 jets or 1 lepton plus 6 jets(in particular , fewer than 10 visible lepton / jets so as to discriminate from the 4 t final states ) and possibly require that one w and the associated t be reconstructed .",
    "in particular , since final states contain at least four b jets , in order to eliminate any residual qcd background , we need one or two b - tags without incurring significant penalty .",
    "such b - tagging should have efficiency of @xmath16 or better .",
    "for the light charged top - pions , the branching ratio of @xmath125 can be comparative to that of @xmath124 . in this case",
    ", @xmath125 is also an important mode which induces the signals @xmath127 .",
    "although @xmath125 is a flavor - changing decay mode , @xmath127 production is not the flavor - changing process .",
    "therefore , the sm background can not be ignored .",
    "the major irreducible background should come from @xmath128 .",
    "the mistagging of b - quark and s - quark will make the @xmath129 become important which significantly enhances the background .",
    "so , the efficient b tagging and mass reconstruction of the charged top - pion is very necessary to reduce the background .    to compare the cross section of @xmath3 with that of similar process @xmath130",
    ", we find that the former is significantly larger than the latter=21.51 , 15.09 fb with @xmath87 gev and @xmath13=300 gev , @xmath131=10.02,8.1 fb with @xmath86=800,1600 gev and @xmath132=300 gev . ] which provide some useful information to distinguish the charged top - pions from charged higgs .",
    "the @xmath133 is the main decay mode for both charged top - pions and charged higgs , such mode is not suitable to distinguish these particles . to obtain the identified signals of the charged top - pions , we should probe charged top - pions via the flavor - changing decay mode @xmath134 .",
    "@xmath135 can also provide the identified signals of charged higgs which does not exist for the charged top - pions .",
    "the production rates of the processes @xmath69 and @xmath3 are studied in this section . in order to give a believable prediction of the yearly event rate",
    ", we also need to consider the overall efficiency factor for detector coverage and for experimentally isolating and detecting these modes .",
    "such efficiency can be reasonable estimated as @xmath136 . on the other hand",
    ", the mass reconstruction and b - tagging will also reduce the efficiency to detect the signals . considering these efficiencies",
    ", we can safely estimate that there should be abundant signals can be identified with the high luminosity at the planned linear colliders , and furthermore , the masses of these new particles might be measured with high accuracy .",
    "in the framework of the tc2 model , @xmath31 and @xmath32 pair productions at the planned @xmath33 colliders are studied in this paper .",
    "we find that the production rates are at the level of a few fb for @xmath137 production and tens",
    "fb for @xmath32 production .",
    "these pair productions can produce multi - jet final states and the sm background can be efficiently reduced .",
    "we conclude that the top - pions and top - higgs predicted by the tc2 model should be experimentally observable via these processes at the planned colliders with high luminosity",
    ". therefore , @xmath31 and @xmath32 pair productions at @xmath138 colliders are very promising production mechanism of the top - pions and top - higgs .",
