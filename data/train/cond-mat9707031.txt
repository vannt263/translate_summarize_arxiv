    "as a class of materials promising for applications in all - optical devices for communication and data processing , conjugated polymers have been a subject of great research interest.@xcite conjugated polymer such as pda has long been recognized to exhibit large nonresonant third - order optical nonlinearities.@xcite most of the theoretical works on the nonlinear optics of these materials are based on the perturbative sum - over - state formula@xcite that suits _ nonresonant _ pumping well ( but is inappropriate for resonant pumping ) .",
    "a fair agreement between experiments and theories has been achieved for a variety of nonresonant spectra , including two - photon absorption , third - harmonic generation , and electroabsorption.@xcite in addition , eom approach has also been employed in these studies.@xcite the eom for polarization , which is similar to the semiconductor bloch equation originally used for inorganic semiconductors@xcite , is a general tool whose validity goes beyond the perturbative regime@xcite and will be used in this paper .    for conjugated polymers under _ resonant _ pumping ,",
    "most of the optically excited electrons and holes remain bound at room temperature and form an exciton gas , instead of a plasma as in the iii - v semiconductors.@xcite this is because the magnitude of the exciton binding energy in conjugated polymers ( of the order of 1 ev ) is much larger than that in inorganic semiconductors ( a few mev ) .",
    "this presents a difficult situation for the calculation of resonant nonlinearity .",
    "even though there are a lot of experimental works , few theory has been devoted to this subject .",
    "a simple and heuristic explanation of this nonlinearity based on phase - space - filling ( psf ) has been proposed , and the result agrees quantitatively with experiments.@xcite the esssence of psf is that when there is a finite concentration of excitons , the phase space for further excitons to form is reduced because of the exclusion principle , and henceforth the probe absorption signal is reduced .",
    "the limitation of psf is that it can not predict the whole spectral response of the electric susceptibility , nor the effects of temperature , strength of electron - electron interaction ... etc .",
    "motivated by the desire to have a more accurate theoretical tool to understand this phenomenon , we present a detailed analysis of the nonlinear susceptibility based on eom .",
    "we will utilize the technique developed by haug , koch , and schmitt - rink to make a connection between exciton populations and the electron populations that appear in the eom.@xcite however , since the link is suitable for dilute exciton gas only , we shall concentrate our study in this regime .",
    "furthermore , from the comparison between the lineshapes of time - resolved and cw photoluminescence spectra , the typical intraband scattering time is estimated to be less than picosecond in polymers.@xcite therefore , it is possible to consider a simpler situation where the exciton gas is in quasi - thermal equilibrium , whose population is determined by the intensity of the pump wave . because of these approximations , phenomena such as exciton - exciton interaction , excited - state absorption , and off - equilibrium momentum distribution are not considered .    in this paper",
    "we have done extensive studies on the optical nonlinearity of pda .",
    "there are several advantages in choosing this material : first , it has the largest nonresonant third - order nonlinearity of all polymers and very large resonant nonlinearity .",
    "second , it is one of a few conjugated polymers that can form high quality single crystals and is more amenable to theoretical analysis .",
    "third , its chain - to - chain distance is large because of large side groups and therefore the inter - chain interaction is less important .",
    "various aspects of the nonlinear spectra are investigated . by choosing a reasonable value of the coulomb interaction strength ,",
    "the resonant optical kerr coefficient @xmath0 being calculated agrees very well with experiments .",
    "furthermore , the effect of electron - electron interaction on the height and position of the exciton absorption peak is studied .",
    "we also study the influence of temperature , as well as the relative populations of singlet and triplet excitons , on the probe spectra .",
    "this work provides a systematic analysis of the influence of various microscopic parameters on the optical nonlinearity and may serve as a guide for the search of optical materials with larger resonant nonlinearities .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the equation of motion for polarization in conjugated polymers is derived . in section iii ,",
    "the coulomb potential matrix elements and electron occupation numbers are calculated .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section vi , and sec .",
    "v is the conclusion .",
    "a conjugated polymer is a macro - molecule with many electronic and ionic degrees of freedom .",
    "there have been several attempts to include both types of degrees of freedom in calculations on the electronic and optical properties of conjugated polymers .",
    "this is a very difficult task . to date ,",
    "an exact solution for chains longer than 20 sites is still lacking.@xcite it is especially challenging to calculate _ resonant _ optical nonlinearity by including the effects of electrons ( including excitons ) and phonons simultaneously . in this paper , we choose a modest approach and focus only on the electronic contribution to the nonlinearity . by doing so ,",
    "we will not , for example , be able to produce satellite phonon peaks next to the main resonant absorption peak.@xcite our main goal is to calculate the optical nonlinearity due to the exciton gas , which is derived from the dependence of the magnitude of the main absorption peak on the exciton populations .",
    "in fact , greene _ et al _ @xcite have demonstrated that the psf model , whose origin is purely electronic , can explain major features of the spectra well .",
    "furthermore , we consider only the dynamics of @xmath2-electrons ; the @xmath3-electrons are tightly bound to the ions and has little influence on the dynamical response .",
    "however , they do contribute to the renormalization of the interaction between @xmath2-electrons , and between ions and @xmath2-electrons .",
    "these effects appear implicitly through the parameters in the @xmath2-electron hamiltonian .",
    "our calculation is based on the ssh - like hamiltonian with electron - electron interactions , @xmath4 , where h_0=_k(_cka_ck^a_ck + _",

    "@xmath9 describes the coupling between polarization and the _ probe _",
    "field @xmath10 along the chain .",
    "the influence of the pump field will be accounted for when calculating the conduction electron populations in the next section .",
    "the potential matrix elements are    _ _ 1_2_3_4^k_1 k_2 k_3 k_4 = d^3 d^3 __1 k_1^*()__2 k_2^*( ) v_ee(-)__3 k_3()__4 k_4 ( ) ,    2 where @xmath11 is the screened coulomb interaction between the @xmath2-electrons , and @xmath12 are the bloch states solved from @xmath13 .",
    "the usual practice is to neglect , from the very beginning , the terms that do not conserve electron numbers in each band , which include half of the sixteen terms that do not have equal numbers of @xmath14 indices and @xmath15 indices , plus @xmath16 and @xmath17.@xcite this is reasonable in metals or inorganic semiconductors where the coulomb interaction is weak , but is not necessarily valid in conjugated polymers where the coulomb interaction is much stronger , as indicated by the large exciton binding energies .",
    "therefore , these terms will be kept in the derivation until they are proven negligible .",
    "it will be shown later that the terms without equal numbers of @xmath14 and @xmath15 indices indeed make no contribution , but the @xmath18 and @xmath19 terms can not be ignored .",
    "in fact , unlike all the other terms , these two terms do not conserve the electron and hole spin individually , thus are essential to the lifting of the four - fold degeneracy in the spin subspace of the exciton states .    in the following ,",
    "we derive the eom for @xmath20 . the total polarization @xmath21 , which is equal to @xmath22 , can be easily obtained by integration over all @xmath23 s . in general , terms of the form @xmath24",
    "are encountered in the derivation . by using the rpa , the mean values of the product of four operators",
    "can be factorized ,    a^__1 k_1 a^__2 k_2  a__3",

    "k_1 k_3 _ k_2 k_4 _ . after a straightforward but tedious calculation , we have [ main0 ] i & = & ( _ vk-_ck)p_k + e(t ) _ vc(k)(n_vk - n_ck ) & - & _ k p_k&+ & _ k(n_vk - n_ck)&+ & _ k(n_vk - n_ck ) ,    2 where @xmath25 are the one electron occupation numbers in conduction or valence band , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are abbreviations for the coulomb terms , @xmath28 , and the exchange terms , @xmath29 , respectively . the terms that are quadratic in @xmath30 are neglected in eq .",
    "( [ main0 ] ) , because only the linear response of the probe wave is considered .",
    "also , relations such as @xmath31 and @xmath32 have been used , which are based on the symmetry between conduction band and valence band in the present model .",
    "note that the potential matrix elements with unequal numbers of @xmath14 and @xmath15 indices result in the last line of eq .",
    "( [ main0 ] ) .",
    "these matrix elements are multiplied by terms quadratic in electron or hole occupations , which under resonant pumping may be large .",
    "notwithstanding , because of inversion symmetry , it can be shown that for thermalized exciton gas , these terms actually have no effect on the dynamics ( see appendix a ) .",
    "consequently , eq .  ( [ main0 ] ) becomes    [ main1 ] & & |p_k ( ) & = & e()_vc(n_vk - n_ck)&- & _ k|p_k()&+ & _ k(n_vk - n_ck ) ,    2 where @xmath33 , and a damping term @xmath34 has been added .",
    "notice that @xmath35 because @xmath36 is not hermitian .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ main1 ] ) has to be solved in conjunction with the equation satisfied by @xmath37 , which is similar to eq .",
    "( [ main1 ] ) but with @xmath38 replaced by @xmath39 and @xmath40 replaced by @xmath37 .",
    "the meaning of the various parts on the right hand side of the equation is explained below : the first square bracket , after being summed over @xmath41 , contributes to the band gap renormalization .",
    "the magnitude of renormalization depends on the strength of inter - electron interaction , _ as well as _ the electron populations .",
    "inside the second square bracket , the @xmath42 term is most crucial to the formation of excitons ; the @xmath43 term is related to the singlet - triplet splitting of the exciton levels and leads to an unusual coupling between positive and negative frequency components of the polarization . for the exchange terms",
    ", it will be shown in the next section that @xmath44 because of charge neutrality condition .",
    "therefore , there is no exchange effect in the first square bracket .",
    "we can also show that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are simply constants and can be treated as corrections to @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the only unknowns in eq .",
    "( [ main1 ] ) are @xmath49 .",
    "all of the other quantities , including the potential matrix elements and the electron populations , can be obtained given physical conditions such as the strength of electron interaction , the intensity of pump wave  etc .",
    "this is derived in the next section .",
    "a natural choice for the interaction potential between electrons is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is given by @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the intra - chain dielectric constant , and @xmath54 is the average distance between neighboring sites .",
    "the position @xmath55 , being dimensionless now , is measured in units of @xmath54 . to calculate @xmath56 ,",
    "the unperturbed eigenstates are expanded by localized wannier functions,@xcite _ k()=_j=1,2 u_j(k ) ( _ m=1^m e^2ikmw_2(m-1)+j ( ) ) , where @xmath57 is the number of unit cells .",

    "when calculating the matrix elements of @xmath61 , only the integrals involving wannier functions at the same site are kept ( zero differential overlap approximation).@xcite to improve upon this , we need to know the shape of atomic orbitals , which will not be considered here . for the same site , there is a finite on - site energy @xmath62 .",
    "since the exact form of the wannier function is not known , @xmath63 is treated as a parameter independent of @xmath51 .",
    "so our choice of the potential is essentially of the pariser - parr - pople form . defining v_1(q)&=&_m v_ee(2m+1)e^-i(2m+1)q , v_2(q)&=&_m v_ee(2m)e^-2imq",

    "note that the conduction band bottoms are at @xmath87 .",
    "the ground state makes major contribution since all the other levels are far off resonance and barely occupied .",
    "according to abe s single configuration interaction ( sci ) calculation,@xcite the ratio @xmath88 determines whether the singlet exciton level ( @xmath89 ) or the triplet exciton level ( @xmath90 ) is lower in energy .",
    "they found that , for @xmath91 and @xmath92 , @xmath90 is lower than @xmath89 , and vice versa .",
    "all the even - parity @xmath93 states are lying at higher energies .",
    "however , it is found in some finite - chain calculations that the lowest excitation is actually an even parity state.@xcite this would have a significant effect on the efficiency of luminescence since the optically excited electrons at @xmath89 may relax to the @xmath93 state first , then release their energy via non - radiative channels .",
    "nontheless , it has been shown that the relaxation rate from the 1@xmath94 exciton to the @xmath95 exciton is much smaller than the relaxation rate to the ground state.@xcite furthermore , from the point of view of phase space filling , both @xmath96 and @xmath95 excitons contribute almost equally to the reduction of phase space .",

    "the inter - chain distance for ppv is about 4 ,@xcite the absorption coefficient for ppv at 400 nm is @xmath163/cm at room temperature , and the total exciton lifetime for ppv film is 0.32 ns.@xcite from these data and the change of refraction index being calculated , we find that the optical kerr coefficient for ppv to be @xmath164 .",
    "this is of the same order as the value for pda .",
    "however , in actucal practice , ppv is rarely used in the study of optical nonlinearity , whether it is resonant or off - resonant .",
    "this may be related to engineering or chemical problems in growing high quality single crystals .",
    "these aspects are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "even if a high quality single crystal for ppv can be obtained , the inter - chain distance will be much smaller in ppv ( 3 to 4 @xmath162 , comparing to 10 @xmath162 for pda ) . under this circumstance ,",
    "the effect of inter - chain coupling probably will invalidate our result presented here .",
    "another complication for ppv is that , for the intensity of @xmath165 , we probably have entered the regime where exciton - exciton annihilation is significant.@xcite also , because of the high concentration the possibility of excited - state absorption increases .",
    "thus , actual pumping efficiency should be lower than that reported here .",
    "all of these reasons will more or less make our calculation futile for ppv .    on the other hand ,",
    "exciton - exciton annihilation may not play a significant role in pda below pump intensity @xmath166 .",
    "a recent paper by schmid showed that the susceptibility of pda does not deviate from a pure @xmath167 behavior until the peak intensity @xmath168.@xcite this seems to indicate that , neither exciton - exciton annihilation , nor excite - state absorption , is appreciable within the range of our consideration .",
    "one possible reason for the higher threshhold of exciton - exciton annihilation is that the exciton radius in pda ( about 10 @xmath162 ) is much smaller than that in ppv ( about 50 @xmath162 ) and has higher saturation density .",
    "this explains to some extent why the same formalism works so well for pda , but not for ppv .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that simple estimates on the exciton density without such annihilation effect has been quite consistent with the experiments@xcite .",
    "resonant optical nonlinearity for conjugated polymers can be understood using the simple picture of psf , in which the probe signal is reduced because the phase space for final states has been occupied by the excitons .",
    "this model provides only an order of magnitude estimate and fails to produce more details such as the probe response over the whole spectral range ( eg . the band edge absorption ) , the position of the exciton peak , the effect of temperature and coulomb interaction ... etc .",
    "the present study is able to access the effects of various microscopic parameters by using the eom method .",
    "we produced the electric susceptibility @xmath113 that contains the information about the positions and oscillator strength of exciton level and conduction band edge . by varying the exciton populations",
    ", we can observe the change of the resonant oscillator strength and the trend is consistent with the psf model ( eq.([psf ] ) ) .",
    "we also calculated the optical kerr coefficient @xmath0 and the value obtained @xmath169 agrees well with observations .",
    "it has to be reminded that several complications in a real polymer system have been left out to simplify the discussion .",
    "we have used a rigid and infinite polymer chain while in actual experiments it is finite and maybe flexible .",
    "the phonon degrees of freedom will contribute to extra features in the absorption curve such as the phonon side - bands.@xcite we have also used the quasi - equilibrium condition for the exciton gas . in future research , the dynamical evolution of exciton density can be included by coupling the equation of motion to the rate equation of the electron population . finally , the present theory has to be modified at high exciton density when exciton - exciton interaction plays a more important role and the rpa is no longer valid .",
    "this may lead to exciton - exciton annihilation , formation of bi - excitons , and even the existence of a gain threshold beyond which lasing can happen.@xcite    m.  c.  c. wishes to thank t.  m.  hong and m.  f.  yang for many helpful discussions .",
    "this work is supported by the national science council of taiwan under contract nos .",
    "nsc86 - 2112-m-007 - 026 and nsc86 - 2112-m-009 - 001 .",
    "the support from the national center of high - performance computing of taiwan is also acknowledged .",
    "based on the symmetry of inversion , we can show that the terms that are quadratic in @xmath170 in eqs .",
    "( [ main0 ] ) do not affect the dynamics of the total polarization .",
    "first , the inversion properties of the bloch states are , _",
    "ck(-r)&=&-_c - k(r),_vk(-r)&=&_v - k(r ) .",
    "this leads to the following identities : _",
    "vc(-k)=_vc(k ) , and _ _ 1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 ^ -k - k & = & v__1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4^kk _ _ 1__2__3__4,__1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 ^ -k - k & = & _ _ 1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4^kk _ _ 1__2__3__4 , where @xmath171 , @xmath172 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath173 changes sign when the number of @xmath14 indices does not equal to the number of @xmath15 indices .",

    "iii b ) , and using the fact that @xmath176 , it is not difficult to see from eq .",
    "( 3.8 ) that n_c , v - k = n_c , vk .    because of the symmetries in eqs .  ( a2 ) , ( a3 ) , and ( a4 ) , the equation for @xmath177 has the same form as the equation for @xmath178 ( see eq .",
    "( [ main0 ] ) , with @xmath23 and @xmath41 being replaced by @xmath179 and @xmath180 ) except that the signs of the terms quadratic in @xmath170 are changed .",
    "consequently , they do not contribute to the total polarization @xmath21 , in which @xmath181 and @xmath177 appear through the combination of @xmath182 only .",
    "notice that the conclusion may not be valid if the electron population is not in thermal equilibrium .",

    "this choice is the same as in ref .",
    "the susceptibility being calculated is not sensitive to this parameter .",
    "for example , if @xmath106 is increased by @xmath185 , the height of an absorption peak is changed by less than 10@xmath186 and the shift of peak position is insignificant .",
    "this is reasonable since dominant contribution to the exciton formation comes from states near the inner band edges ."
