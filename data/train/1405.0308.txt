    "the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) mission is described in detail by @xcite ; i only briefly summarize it here . the instrument measures four infrared bands centered on 3.4 @xmath2 ( w1 ) , 4.6 @xmath2 ( w2 ) , 12 @xmath2 ( w3 ) , and 22 @xmath2 ( w4 ) , using hgcdte arrays for the shorter w1 and w2 bands , and si : as for w3 and w4 .",
    "survey operations began 2010 jan 14 .",
    "coverage of the full sky was completed 2010 jul 17 .",
    "observations continued until 2010 aug 6 , when the solid hydrogen cryogen ran out and the longest band , w4 , became unusable .",
    "`` three - band '' observations using the remaining w1 , w2 , and w3 channels continued until 2010 sep 29 , and the `` neowise post - cryo '' program @xcite continued observations in the shortest w1 and w2 bands until 2011 feb 1 .",
    "the wise telescope is 40 cm and provides a field of view 47 by 47 arcmin which is imaged simultaneously via dichroics on the four detectors .",
    "exposure time was 7.7 sec ( w1 and w2 ) and 8.8 sec ( w3 and w4 ) .",
    "the sky was scanned from ecliptic pole to pole , with roughly 90% overlap from scan to scan . over 99% of the sky",
    "has 11 or more exposures in w3 and w4 , and 23 or more exposures in w1 and w2 .",
    "median coverage is 33 exposures in w1 and w2 , 24 in w3 , and 16 in w4 .",
    "coverage increases toward the ecliptic poles , with over @xmath3 exposures in each band at the poles",

    "the method presented here includes a number of heuristics to handle the imperfections in real data .",
    "these heuristics include noise estimation for image weighting ; masked - pixel patching ; background estimation ; and masking of transients and defects in the imaging .",
    "i weight each image in a coadd based on an estimate of an image - wide ( scalar ) noise estimate .",
    "i did not want to use pixel - wise error estimates ( which incorporate a poisson noise term from the source as well as the sky ) since these lead to biased estimates ( pixels with fewer counts get a smaller error estimate and hence more weight ) . using",
    "an error estimate based only on the baseline background and read - noise should result in weights that optimize the detectability of faint ( background - dominated ) isolated point sources .",
    "i chose a simple heuristic for estimating this scalar error estimate : i take the median of the unmasked uncertainty pixels from the wise single - frame pipeline . since these uncertainty pixels include a component due to poisson noise from the signal as well as read noise , the median value is slightly biased high .",
    "i could instead attempt to estimate the mode of the uncertainty distribution in the same way i estimate the background level .",
    "since i resample the input frames using the lanczos kernel , masked pixels in the input images would lead to large holes ( as large as the support of the kernel ) in the resampled images .",
    "since several percent of the pixels in typical wise images are masked , this would have resulted in unacceptably large losses , so i chose to `` patch '' pixels .",
    "my crude approach is simply to average neighboring valid pixels .",
    "other approaches for patching defects include the linear predictive filter used by the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "patching pixels can be seen as redistributing the weights of the interpolation kernel from the masked pixel to its neighbors .",
    "i mask the resampled pixel closest to the patched pixel , so it is not included in the `` masked '' coadds , @xmath4 .",
    "nearby resampled pixels also include some contribution from the patched pixel ; i chose to include these since their effect should be rather small .",
    "a more principled ( but much more expensive ) approach to patching images would be to fit a forward model to a small image patch and take the model prediction ( with the model fit to unmasked pixels ) as the patched pixel value .",
    "this would take into account the point - spread function , nearby sources , and many nearby pixels , resulting in predictions that were consistent with the modelled astrophysical scene .    for the w1 and w2 bands ,",
    "i assume flat backgrounds and estimate a single scalar background level . for w3 and w4 ,",
    "i found it helpful to fit a varying background , and i chose to use a spatial median filter for this purpose .",
    "if i had a better model for the backgrounds ( from astrophysical and instrumental sources ) and could fit or marginalize over this model , that would comes closer to producing ideal coadds .",
    "a median filter should generally remove trends on spatial scales of order the filter size and preserve features smaller than the filter , but will introduce biases near bright sources and crowded regions ; see  [ fig : badmedfilt ] for example",
    ". it would perhaps be better to avoid including in the median estimate any pixels that appear to be `` contaminated '' by sources ( for example , by skipping pixels that are significantly different than their neighbors ) , though this is just a further heuristic rather than a real solution to the problem of estimating backgrounds .",
    "i am currently exploring possible approaches to reducing the highly depressed background level around bright structures ( as shown in  [ fig : badmedfilt ] ) .",
    "one option would be to also median - smooth on a larger spatial scale and add those filtered values back in , though this would likely still result in artifacts around structures in a range of scales .",
    "another option would be to find the median or some other statistic of the _ stack _ of median - smoothed values , adding this back to the coadd .",
    "this way , extended structures that are _ consistent _ in many individual exposures would appear in the coadd . yet",
    "another approach would be to match the large - scale variations to those found in other data sets , as done by @xcite ; indeed , their maps , with point sources and other small - scale structures removed , could be ideal for repairing the large - scale structures damaged by my median filtering .",
    "the allwise atlas images were created using a `` background - matching '' approach for removing frame - to - frame variations in the background level . in this approach , as a frame is being accumulated into the coadd , its median value is matched to that of the existing coadd , in the region where they overlap .",
    "this approach tends to produce backgrounds that are smooth on large scales ( see  [ fig : badmedfilt ] ) , even in the presence of bright objects , since it uses no explicit estimation of the background level . however , it has the disadvantages that it is order - dependent  the first few frames accumulated into the coadd have disproportionately large influence on the final background  and also depends on the extent of the coadd tile : shifting the tile boundaries results in different backgrounds .",
    "i attempt to mask transients and defects in the individual exposures by building an initial coadd to estimate the mean and variance of the input frame pixels contributing to each coadd pixel .",
    "this approach of storing only summary statistics is in contrast to the approach used in the allwise release , of keeping in memory the full list of input frame pixels contributing to each coadd pixel , and then performing operations on those pixel lists . using robust statistical estimates , the wise team s approach should allow nearly 50% of the input frames to be contaminated without affecting the results .",
    "this power presumably comes at significant computational cost and complexity . my simpler and cheaper approach of accumulating only the mean and variance ( and removing an input frame s contribution to these estimates before evaluating that frame ) should be expected to work well at flagging a single moderate outliers in each pixel , or multiple extreme outliers if the number of contributing frames is large .",
    "if there is more than a single outlier , the sample variance estimate will be inflated by the outlier , and moderate outliers will no longer deviate from the mean enough to be flagged . despite these expected shortcomings ,",
    "i have found that my simple approach seems to work well in practice .",
    "possible improvements would be to detect pixels whose sample variance is larger than would be expected from a poisson noise model , and do more careful outlier detection there .    in attempting to remove artifacts such as satellite trails and cosmic rays , we also remove fast - moving sources and clip sources that vary in brightness .",
    "one would expect variable sources to induce a larger sample variances than a non - varying source of the same mean magnitude , and this might be a simple way of flagging such sources . in general ,",
    "though , these coadds should be used for the non - transient sky only .",
    "one might ask why i felt it necessary to write a new code to produce these coadds when publicly available codes such as swarp @xcite already exist .",
    "the core coaddition ( image warping and interpolation ) could indeed have been implemented using swarp , but the detection and masking of transients and defects ( which i do by creating first - round coadds ) would have required first running swarp to do the interpolation and first - round coadds , then detecting and masking transients in the `` temporary '' files written by swarp , then running the second - round coadds on these altered files .",
    "i felt it would be simpler to reimplement the warping and interpolation functionality .",
    "the wise team should be commended on their timely , high - quality data releases .",
    "one shortcoming i have attempted to address in this work is that the atlas images are blurred by convolution by the point - spread function .",
    "i present a new set of coadded images that preserve the resolution of the original exposures .",
    "i use a theoretically justified resampling method with some approximations . in the process of validating my results",
    ", i found that my pixelwise sample variances , and likely the allwise release atlas images as well , include a @xmath53% systematic uncertainty in addition to the expected statistical uncertainty .",
    "these images , and the code used to produce them , are publicly available at http://unwise.me[_http://unwise.me_ ] .",

    "<S> the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; @xcite ) satellite observed the full sky in four mid - infrared bands in the @xmath0 to @xmath1 @xmath2 range . </S>",
    "<S> the primary mission was completed in 2010 . </S>",
    "<S> the wise team have done a superb job of producing a series of high - quality , well - documented , complete data releases in a timely manner . however , the `` atlas image '' coadds that are part of the recent allwise and previous data releases were intentionally blurred . convolving the images by the point - spread function while coadding results in `` matched - filtered '' images that are close to optimal for detecting isolated point sources . </S>",
    "<S> but these matched - filtered images are sub - optimal or inappropriate for other purposes . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we are photometering the wise images at the locations of sources detected in the sloan digital sky survey @xcite through forward modeling , and this blurring decreases the available signal - to - noise by effectively broadening the point - spread function . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents a new set of coadds of the wise images that have not been blurred . </S>",
    "<S> these images retain the intrinsic resolution of the data and are appropriate for photometry preserving the available signal - to - noise . </S>",
    "<S> users should be cautioned , however , that the w3- and w4-band coadds contain artifacts around large , bright structures ( large galaxies , dusty nebulae , etc ) ; eliminating these artifacts is the subject of ongoing work . </S>",
