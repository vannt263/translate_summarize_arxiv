    "springer varieties are a collection of varieties that arise in two mathematical areas : geometric representation theory and low - dimensional topology .",
    "springer varieties were originally investigated because their cohomology carries a graded representation of the symmetric group @xmath0 and their top - dimensional cohomology is irreducible .",
    "many geometric constructions of the springer representation exist ; @xcite has a survey .",
    "one thing geometric constructions share is that explicit calculations are impossible outside of special cases .    in important",
    "recent work @xcite khovanov studied a family of rings related to an invariant of tangle cobordisms .",
    "he discovered the center of each ring was isomorphic to the cohomology of the springer variety corresponding to the partition @xmath4 , which we call @xmath1 .",
    "he conjectured that @xmath1 could be realized as a subspace of the @xmath5-fold product of spheres @xmath6 , with components homeomorphic to @xmath7 and indexed by noncrossing matchings ; this follows from recent work of cautis - kamnitzer @xcite as shown in the appendix of this paper .",
    "permutation representations arise in the work of khovanov et alia , but for the group @xmath8 rather than @xmath0 .",
    "this paper brings together the two themes of geometric representation theory and low - dimensional topology .",
    "we obtain an explicit geometric and combinatorial construction of the springer action for @xmath1 .",
    "unlike other presentations of springer representations , our construction is clear and elementary  both geometrically and combinatorially .",
    "we use this explicit construction to identify the springer representations in _ every _ degree of homology and to identify the kazhdan - lusztig basis explicitly and simply in top - degree homology .",
    "the variety @xmath2 and its homology have a natural @xmath0-action given by permuting the copies of @xmath9 .",
    "we use an antipodal map @xmath10 to embed @xmath1 in the product of spheres and prove that @xmath0 restricts to a permutation action on the image @xmath11 .",
    "not every geometric map @xmath12 satisfies this property ; indeed if @xmath13 is the identity embedding then @xmath14 is in general not an @xmath0-subrepresentation of @xmath15 .",
    "we prove four main theorems in this paper :    * that there is a well - defined @xmath0-action on @xmath16 ( theorem [ well - defined representation ] ) ; * that the geometric representation is described combinatorially as an action of @xmath0 on noncrossing matchings that permutes the strands of the matchings ( theorem [ well - defined representation ] ) ; * that the @xmath0-action on @xmath11 is the springer representation ( theorem [ springer repn ] ) ; * and that the springer representation on @xmath17 is the irreducible representation corresponding to the partition @xmath18 ( theorem [ springer repn ] ) .",
    "a search of the literature shows that  the springer representation \" can mean any of : springer s original representation on the cohomology of springer varieties @xcite , any other construction of the same representation , a construction of springer s representation tensored with the sign representation @xcite , or a homology representation that is isomorphic to springer s cohomology representation @xcite .",

    "we prove it is the springer representation by comparing it explicitly with the de concini - procesi construction of springer representations @xcite , using tools from garsia - procesi s combinatorial analysis of de concini - procesi s work @xcite . our description of the homology of the springer variety @xmath1 uses techniques from skein modules developed by russell in @xcite , unlike de concini - procesi s presentation , which relies on borel s quotient presentation of the cohomology of the flag variety .",
    "we exploit two different antipodal maps @xmath19 in section [ antipodal embeddings ] .",
    "the first is a geometric embedding of the entire variety , defined to be the identity on even coordinates and the antipodal map on odd coordinates .",
    "the second is an embedding of each component of @xmath1 ; it is more natural in topological contexts and useful for computations but does not extend to all of @xmath1 .",
    "corollary [ finally ] proves the image @xmath16 is the span of the images of antipodal maps on each component , permitting us to use both types of antipodal maps in our calculations .",
    "the product basis of @xmath15 allows us to identify the @xmath0-representation on @xmath16 with a subspace of young tabloids , a classical construction of @xmath0-representations .",
    "the tabloid sums corresponding to basis elements in @xmath16 are not the classical basis for specht modules ; our methods allow us to conclude that we obtain the kazhdan - lusztig basis in top degree , and we conjecture that this is true in all degrees .",
    "we show that for each @xmath20 the appropriate specht module intersects @xmath21 nontrivially .",
    "the dimensions of the two subspaces agree , so the image @xmath21 is irreducible and the @xmath0-representation we defined on @xmath3 is the springer representation .",
