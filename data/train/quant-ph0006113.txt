    "the superposition principle and nonlocality are aspects of quantum mechanics that have teased and enticed the scientific and general communities alike since its development earlier this century .",
    "more specifically , conceptual difficulties arise when one tries to reconcile these features with the behaviour of the macroscopic , everyday world with which we are most familiar .",
    "these difficulties are exemplified by the classic schrdinger cat @xcite and einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) @xcite paradoxes .",
    "the boundary between the quantum and classical worlds remains a very active area of research , with , in particular , the atomic physics and quantum optics communities recently providing a number of significant experimental demonstrations .",
    "these include the preparation of mesoscopic superposition states  in particular , superpositions of small - amplitude coherent states  of a material oscillator ( a trapped atom ) @xcite and of a cavity radiation field @xcite , and the generation of quantum - mechanically entangled internal states of pairs @xcite and quadruplets @xcite of atoms .",
    "these experiments open the door to detailed and highly - controlled investigations of quantum measurement , quantum decoherence , and nonlocality in mesoscopic systems and with massive particles .",
    "further along these lines , in this work we consider a combination of the technologies used in the above demonstrations , that is , single - atom trapping and cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , to propose a scheme for the preparation of , arguably , a yet more exotic quantum state  a delocalised mesoscopic superposition state of two or more distantly - separated trapped atoms ; that is , a state of the form @xmath0 denotes a coherent state ( in one dimension ) of the _ motion of the atom _ at the @xmath1-th site , and @xmath2 is a normalisation factor .",
    "the term ` mesoscopic ' is used because the coherent state @xmath3 is a ` classical - like ' state , for which the mean number of quanta , @xmath4 , may be relatively large ( within the constraints of our scheme ) .    before continuing ,",
    "we make note of proposals that exist for the preparation of separated _ light fields _ in states of the form ( [ state ] ) with @xmath5 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "again though , it should be emphasised that here we are dealing with the states of _ massive particles_.",
    "central to the proposed scheme is the ability to exchange quantum states between the motion of a trapped atom and a light field , allowing long - distance transmission of quantum information .",
    "as described in recent work @xcite , this can be done using a set of interactions in cavity qed , which we now summarise .",
    "the basic setup used was originally considered by zeng and lin @xcite .",
    "this setup consists of a two - level atom ( or ion ) confined in a harmonic trap located inside an optical cavity .",
    "the atomic transition of frequency @xmath6 is coupled to a single mode of the cavity field of frequency @xmath7 and is also driven by an external ( classical ) laser field of frequency @xmath8 .",
    "the physical setup and excitation scheme are depicted in fig .  1",
    ", with the relevant internal atomic levels being @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the cavity is aligned along the @xmath11-axis , while the laser field [ laser a in fig .",
    "1(b ) ] is incident from a direction in the @xmath12-@xmath13 plane .",
    "the additional lasers b , c , and d and internal atomic levels @xmath14 and @xmath15 will be discussed later , but can be ignored for the moment .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the atom - cavity system takes the form ( in a frame rotating at the laser frequency @xmath8 ) @xmath16 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\;\\;\\ ; + \\ , \\hbar g_0 \\sin ( k\\hat{x } ) ( \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{\\sigma}_- + \\hat{\\sigma}_+\\hat{a } )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\;\\;\\ ; + \\ ,   \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{\\upsilon}_{\\rm c } +   \\hat{\\upsilon}_{\\rm c}^\\dagger \\hat{a } + \\ ,   \\hat{\\sigma}_+ \\hat{\\upsilon}_{\\rm a } +   \\hat{\\upsilon}_{\\rm a}^\\dagger \\hat{\\sigma}_- \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath17 are the harmonic oscillation frequencies along the principal axes of the trap , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are annihilation operators for the quantised atomic motion and cavity field , respectively , @xmath20 is the atomic lowering operator for the @xmath21 transition , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 is the ( time - dependent ) amplitude of laser field a. the single - photon atom - cavity dipole coupling strength is given by @xmath25 , while the sine function describes the standing wave structure of the cavity field ( we assume that the centre of the trap is located at a _ node _ of the cavity field ) , with @xmath26 the wavenumber of the field and @xmath27^{1/2}(\\hat{b}_x+\\hat{b}_x^\\dagger ) $ ] .",
    "finally , the last line in ( [ h ] ) describes the coupling of the internal cavity field mode to the ` reservoir ' of external field modes ( with @xmath28 the ` reservoir annihilation operator ' ) , which produces damping of the cavity field , and the coupling of the atomic transition to ( vacuum ) radiation field modes other than the cavity mode , which gives rise to free - space spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "note that we neglect any forms of motional decoherence associated with the trap itself .    in @xcite",
    "a number of assumptions and approximations are made in order to simplify the model .",
    "in particular :    1 .",
    "the detunings of the light fields from the atomic transition frequency are assumed to be very large [ that is , @xmath29 , enabling atomic spontaneous emission to be neglected and the internal atomic dynamics to be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "the size of the harmonic trap is assumed to be small compared to the optical wavelength ( lamb - dicke regime ) , enabling the approximations @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the lamb - dicke parameter for the @xmath11-axis .",
    "note that this assumption ultimately places a restriction on the mean excitation numbers @xmath33 associated with the vibrational state of the atom , since the atomic wavepacket broadens with increasing @xmath34 .",
    "we will return to this point in the discussion when we consider the experimental feasibility of the scheme 3 .",
    "the cavity and laser fields are tuned so that @xmath35 ; that is , the fields are tuned to drive raman transitions between neighbouring vibrational levels [ see fig .",
    "4 .   the trap frequency @xmath36 and cavity field decay rate @xmath37 are assumed to satisfy @xmath38 .",
    "the first inequality allows a rotating - wave approximation to be made with respect to the trap oscillation frequency , while the second inequality enables an adiabatic elimination of the cavity field mode .",
    "given these conditions one can show that the description of the motional mode dynamics in the @xmath11 direction can be reduced to the simple quantum langevin equation @xmath39 \\hat{b}_x + e^{i\\phi_{\\rm a } } \\sqrt{2\\gamma ( t ) } \\ , e^{-i\\nu_xt } \\hat{a}_{\\rm in}(t)\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath40 ^ 2 .\\ ] ] the operator @xmath41 obeys the commutation relation @xmath42 = \\delta ( t - t^\\prime ) $ ] and describes the quantum noise input to the cavity field ( in a frame rotating at the cavity frequency ) through the partially transmitting input / output mirror [ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ] .",
    "the significance of eq.([qle ] ) is that it amounts to a simple coupling of the motional mode to propagating light modes external to the cavity .",
    "more precisely , from the input - output theory of optical cavities @xcite , it can be shown that the cavity output field is given , under the present circumstances , by @xmath43 where we have set @xmath44 for simplicity . following work by cirac _",
    "et al_. @xcite ( see also @xcite ) on the transmission of a qubit between two nodes of a quantum network , it is shown in @xcite that if the output field from one of our atom - cavity configurations is incident on a second such atom - cavity configuration , with the coupling between systems being _ unidirectional _ , then with suitably tailored laser pulses @xmath45 and @xmath46 applied at the two sites one may realise the motional state transfer ( assuming both atoms to be in the internal state @xmath9 ) @xmath47 is an _",
    "arbitrary _ quantum state describing the motion along the @xmath11-axis .",
    "such a state transfer configuration is illustrated schematically in fig .  2 ,",
    "while example pulse shapes , specified through the effective coupling rates of the motional modes to the external light fields , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , are @xcite @xmath50 assuming the transfer starts at @xmath51 and concludes at @xmath52 , with @xmath53 a constant [ equal to the maximum value of @xmath54 $ ] @xcite .",
    "armed with this capability , we are able to distribute quantum states of a material oscillator , and generate entanglement , between macroscopically - separated locations , leading to some fascinating possibilities , one of which we now consider .",
    "in addition to the atom - cavity coupling , our scheme for the preparation of a delocalised coherent state utilises auxiliary lasers b , c , and d and internal atomic levels @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "lasers b and c induce coherent raman transitions between the internal states @xmath14 and @xmath9 , and their frequency difference is chosen to be resonant with the transition frequency @xmath55 , so that the motional state of the trapped atom is unaffected @xcite .",
    "it is further assumed that if the atom is in the internal state @xmath14 then it does not ` see ' the cavity field or the coupling laser a. hence , the motional state transfer described above only occurs when the atoms are in the internal state @xmath9 .",
    "laser field d , when switched on , resonantly excites the transition @xmath56 ; detection ( absence ) of fluorescence from this transition projects the system onto the internal state @xmath14 ( @xmath9 ) @xcite . finally ,",
    "while we focus on the ( quasi - classical ) coherent state @xmath57 , it should be noted that the scheme outlined below will work for an arbitrary motional state @xmath58 .        by adding another atom - cavity system to the cascade of fig .",
    "2 , it is straightforward to extend the above scheme to prepare a motional coherent state delocalised between _ three _ atoms . taking now the initial state of the system to be @xmath65 a suitable pulse is then applied by lasers b2 and c2 to atom 2 , causing the internal state transformation @xmath66 lasers b1 , c1 and b2 , c2 are finally applied to atoms 1 and 2 to generate the internal state transformations @xmath67 , after which the overall state becomes @xmath68 internal state detection of atom 2 in the level @xmath61 ( via laser d2 ) projects the system onto a state where , once again , correlated with each internal state of atom 1 is a delocalised motional coherent state , only now the state is delocalised between three atoms .",
    "a further internal state projection onto @xmath69 will of course disentangle internal and external degrees of freedom to yield the state @xmath70   other possibilities ---------------------    the cases considered above clearly represent only a small subset of the state manipulations that are in principle possible with the trapped - atom - cavity configuration .",
    "other combinations and sequences of internal state transformations and motional state transfers can produce a wide variety of entangled and delocalised quantum states . while we have not explored the possibilities exhaustively , two particular examples seem worthy of note .",
    "consider the situation in which the initial motional state of atom 1 is prepared as the simple superposition of fock states @xmath75 following the procedure outlined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq1][2atom ] ) the ( nonmaximally ) entangled motional state that results is @xmath76 which is an example of what may be called a _ hardy state _",
    "note that , for the purpose of preparing such a state , @xmath77 could be replaced by any fock state @xmath78 with @xmath79 , or indeed by any ( possibly mesoscopic ) state orthogonal to @xmath80 .",
    "the delocalised states prepared by the present scheme evidently offer a number of very interesting possibilities in a variety of different contexts , particularly given the exquisite control with which the states of trapped atoms can now be manipulated ( see , for example , @xcite ) , and the flexibility and efficiency that is in principle possible with regards to measurements ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it is also worth emphasising again the ability to transfer the states of the motional modes onto propagating light fields with well - defined spatial and temporal properties [ eq.([aout ] ) ] .",
    "the resulting delocalised light fields could of course be subjected to standard optical manipulations and measurements .      1 .",
    "_ tests of quantum mechanics versus local realism _ : + the ghz and hardy states just discussed allow for measurement outcomes from a _ single _ set of observations that are forbidden by theories based on local realism ( ` nonlocality without inequalities ' ) . entangled coherent states of the form @xmath81 is a fock state , are also relevant to the idea of reversible measurements on a quantum system , or ` quantum jump inversion ' @xcite , which is in turn of relevance to quantum error correction in quantum computing @xcite .",
    "investigations of perceptual processes _ : + if , for example , having prepared a state of the form @xmath82 , one switches on lasers a1 and a2 and separates the two cavity output fields in space , then the result will be a 10-photon light pulse delocalised between two distinct paths @xcite . if these light pulses should be directed from distinct regions of space towards the retina of a single ( possibly human ) observer , then ghirardi @xcite has suggested the possibility of new investigations into the linearity ( or nonlinearity ) of quantum mechanics and the formation of definite perceptions",
    "limits in interferometry _ : + the state @xmath83 is known to allow the optimum @xmath84 phase sensitivity in a two - mode interferometer @xcite and so is potentially of interest in the context of precision measurements .",
    "entangled light fields of this form ( which could be generated in the manner described in the previous application ) have also been proposed for use in interferometric optical lithography , where they allow one in principle to beat the diffraction limit and write features much smaller than the optical wavelength @xcite .      the validity of , and constraints set by , the assumptions made in deriving the motion - to - light state exchange model that is central to the present work are discussed and examined in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "briefly , some of the more significant of these assumptions are as follows .    1 .",
    "_ lamb - dicke assumption _ : + taking into account the spread of the atomic wave function with increasing mean excitation number @xmath85 , the approximation @xmath86 can be associated with a condition of the form @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the variance of the number state distribution @xcite .",
    "if we consider , for example , a coherent state of mean excitation number @xmath89 , this condition reduces to @xmath90 .",
    "trap frequency and cavity linewidth _ : + simulations of the atom - cavity configuration and the state transfer procedure show that the rotating - wave approximation ( with respect to the trap frequency ) requires that @xmath36 be at least five to ten times larger than the cavity field decay rate @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "atomic spontaneous emission _ :",
    "+ finite population in the atomic excited state leads to a finite degree of atomic spontaneous emission . for the effects of spontaneous emission on the atomic motional state",
    "to be negligible for the duration of the state transfer process ( which occurs on a timescale of the order of @xmath91 ) , the condition @xmath92 is desirable @xcite .",
    "this is simply the condition of strong coupling in cavity qed .",
    "4 .   _ propagation losses _ : + throughout this work we have of course assumed ideal ( i.e. , lossless ) propagation of the light fields from one cavity to another .",
    "photon losses will clearly degrade the fidelity of the state transmission ; some investigation along these lines is presented in @xcite , where , in particular , reflection of photons from the second cavity is allowed for .",
    "it is also noted , however , that photons ` lost ' from the system in this way can in principle be detected and so postselection could be used to isolate ` successful ' transmissions .",
    "satisfying all of these conditions and constraints obviously constitutes a tremendous experimental challenge , although there is reason to be hopeful .",
    "lamb - dicke parameters of the order of 0.1 or smaller , and trapping frequencies of several mhz to tens of mhz are now routinely achieved in ion - trapping experiments ( see , for example , @xcite ) . optical dipole traps or magnetic traps",
    "are also capable of confining neutral atoms in the lamb - dicke regime with frequencies in the mhz range ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    also encouraging are the first generation of experiments in which single ( neutral ) atoms are trapped inside optical cavities in the regime of strong coupling cavity qed @xcite .",
    "these experiments were not in a regime where the effective trapping frequency is larger than @xmath37 ( although effective lamb - dicke parameters along the cavity axis were small ) , but given the aforementioned possibilities for trapping and given probable further improvements in mirror technology ( that is , higher cavity finesses ) , it seems reasonable to expect that future experiments trapping single atoms or ions inside optical cavities will be able to meet the various criteria of our scheme simultaneously .    with regards to intercavity propagation of possibly nonclassical light fields , one can point , for example , to the experiment of turchette _",
    "et al_. @xcite , in which squeezed light from an optical parametric oscillator was transported through free space over a distance of several metres to a cavity - qed experimental configuration .",
    "transmission and mode - matching efficiencies in excess of 90% were achieved .",
    "an estimate for likely timescales involved in the present scheme can be given ; if , for example , one assumes a trap frequency of @xmath93 and a cavity field decay rate of @xmath94 , then an estimate for the rate of state transfer might be @xmath95 , or @xmath96 .",
    "note that the other basic operations involved in the scheme using the auxiliary lasers b , c , and d are routinely performed with very high efficiency in trapped - ion experiments , while the timescale for decoherence of motional states of single trapped ions is typically of the order of milliseconds or even longer @xcite .",
    "this intrinsically slow decoherence rate of the motional state would allow for ( relatively ) long - lived delocalised quantum superpositions , which is an important and attractive feature of the proposal put forward in this work .",

    "he also thanks the quantum optics groups at the university of innsbruck and the california institute of technology for support and hospitality during visits when part of this work was carried out .",
    "note that , as shown in @xcite , it is also possible to to design pulse shapes to produce the state transfer ( [ statetransfer ] ) in the case where the cavity mode dynamics is retained in the model ; that is , when the cavity modes are not adiabatically eliminated from the system dynamics .",
