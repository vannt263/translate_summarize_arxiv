    "clusters of galaxies are believed to be the only closed chemically evolving systems in the universe , in the sense that they do not lose matter into the intercluster space . inside them , however , violent processes of matter and energy exchange between the galaxies and the intracluster medium should occur .",
    "this conclusion comes from the fact that heavy elements , which are nearly equally distributed between galaxies and the icm , can only be produced within galaxies in the course of ` normal ' stellar evolution ( e.g. renzini @xcite ) .",
    "since in recent years the number of the icm abundance determinations and their accuracy have increased significantly , the interest to the field of the chemical evolution of galaxy clusters has raised , too .",
    "several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the metal transport from the galaxies to the icm . among them",
    "are enriched gas ejection during the merging of protogalactic fragments ( protogalaxies ) in the early universe ( gnedin @xcite ) , ram - pressure stripping of enriched gas both from spiral and elliptical galaxies ( gunn & gott @xcite ; himmes & biermann @xcite ; fukumoto & ikeuchi @xcite ) , and the hot galactic wind from ellipticals ( matteucci & vettolani @xcite ; david et al .",
    "@xcite ; matteucci & gibson @xcite ; renzini @xcite ; gibson & matteucci @xcite ; and others ) .    from these , the last mechanism draws more and more attention as an ultimate explanation of the icm @xmath0-abundance .",
    "moreover , as arnaud et al .",
    "( @xcite ) pointed out , it was the hypothesis about the galactic wind from ellipticals , which led to prediction of heavy element existence in the icm ( larson @xcite ; larson & dinerstein @xcite ) .",
    "this hypothesis arises from the assumption that ellipticals began their history with the strong starburst followed by multiple supernova events .",
    "these explosions after a very short time expelled all the interstellar matter into the icm , having provided it with heavy elements and thermal energy . at the same time",
    ", hot galactic wind is thought to be responsible for establishing the correlation of luminosity ( mass ) and metallicity , observed in ellipticals .    as several theoretical studies of this process",
    "have shown , mass loss from ellipticals is effective enough to explain @xmath0-abundance in the icm , though this mechanism , according to some of these studies , requires the imf of high @xmath1 galaxies to be richer in massive stars than today ( matteucci & vettolani @xcite ; david et al .",
    "@xcite ; matteucci & gibson @xcite ; okazaki et al .",
    "@xcite ) . futhermore , arnaud et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found observational confirmation of the ellipticals being the dominant source of intracluster metals in the apparent increase of the iron mass in galaxy clusters with the growth of the combined e+s0 luminosity . from this",
    "they concluded that the role of spiral galaxies in the icm enrichment is negligible .",
    "this possibly explains why spiral galaxies lack attention as a potential source of the intracluster metals , though , as fukumoto & ikeuchi ( 1996 ) argued , a single spiral galaxy could be as effective in the icm enrichment as an elliptical one , and correlation of iron mass with the combined luminosity of ellipticals and lenticulars is caused by that early - type galaxies outnumber spirals .",
    "furthermore , recently kauffmann & charlot ( @xcite ) suggested that metals in the icm had been ejected from the primordial population of spirals that have later merged to form present - day early - type galaxies . in their model ,",
    "spiral galaxies are not the dominant , but the only source of heavy elements in hot intracluster gas .",
    "recently we also argued that disk galaxies suffer significant @xmath0-loss ( shustov et al .",
    "@xcite ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "we considered two processes leading to heavy element expulsion from disk galaxies : hot galactic wind and dust expelling by the stellar radiation pressure .",
    "it was shown that these processes are rather effective and may result in the luminosity - metallicity correlation observed in disk galaxies . in this paper",
    "we extend these calculations to the integration of heavy - element production in disk galaxies of various masses over the galactic mass function , thus assessing @xmath0-loss from all disk galaxies in a typical cluster .    in section  2",
    "we briefly describe the chemical evolution model used for computation of heavy element loss from a disk galaxy . in section  3",
    "results of integration of oxygen and iron losses over the galactic mass function are presented and compared with the analogous data for elliptical galaxies .",
    "they are discussed in section  4 .",
    "a conclusion follows that a disk galaxy enriches the icm as effective as an elliptical one of the same mass .",
    "model of galactic evolution used here is outlined in paper  i and wiebe et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "its primary feature is that in addition to the conventional mass conservation equations for a total gas mass and for a particular element ( tinsley @xcite ) we solve the energy equation , based on a balance between the turbulent energy input from supernova explosions and its dissipation in cloud - cloud collisions . in paper",
    "i we have successfully used this model to show that disk galaxies suffer significant loss of heavy elements , while in wiebe at al .",
    "( @xcite ) we showed that this model is good in reproducing main characteristics of our galaxy .",
    "as in wiebe et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , here we model the evolution of oxygen and iron . for the oxygen production we interpolate metallicity - dependent yields of maeder ( @xcite ) .",
    "iron is assumed to originate both in core - collapse and ia supernovae .",
    "its production is taken into account according to thielemann , nomoto & hashimoto ( @xcite ; sn  ib+ii ) and tsujimoto et al .",
    "( @xcite ; sn  ia ) .",
    "each ia  supernova is assumed to produce 0.6@xmath2 of iron .",
    "time delay for these sne is taken to be equal to @xmath3  years ( tutukov & yungelson @xcite ) .",
    "we use salpeter - like initial mass function with limits 0.1 and 100@xmath2 .    within the context of the present paper",
    "it is important to remind how we take into account heavy element loss from disk galaxies .",
    "we consider two processes ejecting @xmath0 into the icm .",
    "they are hot galactic wind and dust expelling by the stellar radiation pressure .",
    "heavy element loss rates due to both processes depend a on galaxy mass , in the sense that low - mass galaxies lose their metals more effectively .",
    "hot galactic wind forms from merged galactic fountains produced by multiple supernova explosions in ob - associations ( mac low et al .",
    "@xcite ; norman & ikeuchi @xcite ; igumentschev , shustov , & tutukov @xcite ) .",
    "only a fraction @xmath4 of this wind is lost into the circumgalactic space . combining observational and theoretical results , we derived in paper  i linear dependence of @xmath4 on the galaxy mass .",
    "this dependence is based on two theoretical and several observational points . according to igumentschev et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , @xmath5 for galaxies with masses greater than @xmath6 .",
    "de young & gallagher ( @xcite ) showed that in a galaxy of @xmath7 @xmath8 . in paper",
    "i we supplied these theoretical limits with several intermediate observational points , assuming that the surface filling factor of supershells produced by the multiple explosions can be a natural estimate for @xmath4 .",
    "resultant dependence of @xmath4 on the logarithm of the galaxy mass is well fitted by a straight line ( see paper  i for details ) .",
    "the second process leading to @xmath0-loss from a disk galaxy is dust expelling by the stellar radiation pressure .",
    "existence of extended dust halo around disk galaxies is demonstrated in a number of observations ( zaritski @xcite ; howk & savage @xcite ) .",
    "using numerical model elaborated by shustov & wiebe ( @xcite ) , we estimated dust loss dependence on a galaxy mass .",
    "it turns out that effectiveness of dust expelling decreases with galactic mass , again approaching nearly zero for galaxies with masses @xmath9 .",
    "a new important feature is included in the present version of our model . in its previous version ,",
    "described in wiebe et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the galaxy forms at once that leads to high star formation rate in the early galaxy life . to make our model more realistic , in its present version we change the initial conditions by adding the initial accretion phase .    in a collapsing ( protogalactic ) cloud",
    ", the rate of matter accretion onto the cloud core depends only on the cloud initial temperature ( e.g. massevitch & tutukov @xcite ) .",
    "we assume in our standard model that the accretion rate is 100@xmath2 yr@xmath10 .",
    "that corresponds to the accretion time @xmath11 years . during this time mass of",
    "the galaxy grows with constant rate ; when it equals to @xmath12 , the accretion stops .",
    "this makes the starburst lower and smoother .",
    "we perform calculations as follows . using our galaxy as a standard",
    ", we find proper values of free parameters to reproduce its main properties , including dependence of metallicity on the height above the galactic disk and [ o / fe][fe / h ] correlation .",
    "after that , adopted values of parameters are kept fixed and used further to model galaxies of different masses .",
    "we investigate the evolution of oxygen and iron ejection from galaxies with masses between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "less massive galaxies also eject heavy elements into the icm , however , as we noted in wiebe et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , our model probably does not work for them , mainly because the assumption of the self - regulated star formation is not valid in small systems .",
    "in order to compare our results with existing estimates of heavy element ejection from elliptical galaxies we compute two models : salpeter imf ( @xmath15 ) and flat imf ( @xmath16 ) .    shown in fig .",
    "[ ofe1 ] is a time dependence of ejected oxygen and iron mass from the galaxy with @xmath17 for the two different cases ( throughout the paper the standard cosmological model with @xmath18 is adopted ) .",
    "introducing in the model the flat imf with higher proportion of massive star increases both oxygen and iron production nearly by an order of magnitude .    in fig .",
    "[ ofe2]a our results for oxygen loss ( integrated over time to @xmath19 years ) are presented in comparison with predictions of david et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and matteucci & gibson ( @xcite ) .",
    "[ ofe2]b depicts results for iron ejection according to the same papers . in all cases upper curve corresponds to",
    "the flat imf , and lower curve corresponds to the ` ordinary ' imf ( @xmath15 for this paper and matteucci & gibson ; @xmath20 for david et al . ) .    as it is demonstrated by fig .",
    "[ ofe2 ] , disk galaxies with masses less than @xmath21 are as effective in enriching the icm with o and fe as ellipticals .",
    "specific feature of our model is steep decrease in the heavy element ejection rate for more massive galaxies .",
    "this is caused by the adopted form of dependence of the ejection efficiency on the galactic mass , as explained above .",
    "the similar decrease of the heavy element ejection rate for massive disk galaxies was argued also by kauffmann & charlot ( @xcite ) . in their model ,",
    "galaxies with circular velocities greater than 250 km s@xmath10",
    "( i.e. , slightly more massive than the galaxy ) eject only 20 per cent of the intracluster metals .    to assess the overall production of o and fe in disk galaxies one has to integrate mass of the element ejected from a single galaxy over the galactic mass function .",
    "it is now widely assumed that the present galactic luminosity function ( lf ) can be described by schechter ( @xcite ) law with reasonable accuracy .",
    "we take schechter function in its original form , assuming that the spiral luminosity function is proportional to it ( universality of lf for all morphological types was recently confirmed by andreon @xcite and marzke et al .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath22 \\mbox{d}\\left({l\\over l_*}\\right ) , \\label{schechter}\\ ] ] with limits @xmath23 and @xmath24 being the minimum and maximum luminosities , expressed in units of @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 is a number fraction of spirals and @xmath27 is cluster richness , as defined by schechter ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the quantities computed in our model is final galaxy luminosity . comparing it with the galaxy mass",
    ", we find that in our model the present - day mass - luminosity relation fits the power law @xmath28 substituting it in ( [ schechter ] ) , we obtain the present - day mass function @xmath29 \\mbox{d}\\left({m\\over m_*}\\right),\\\\\\ ] ] where @xmath30 are mass limits mentioned above and @xmath31 .",
    "now we may write the formula for the mass of this element ejected by all galaxies in the cluster @xmath32m_{\\rm z } \\mbox{d}\\left({m\\over m_*}\\right ) , \\label{eje}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the mass of heavy elements ejected by the galaxy of the mass @xmath34 . using this function",
    "we can compute the evolution of the intergalactic oxygen and iron produced in disk galaxies .",
    "results of integration are presented in fig .",
    "[ ofe3 ] where oxygen and iron yields are shown as functions of redshift .",
    "they are computed with @xmath35 and @xmath25 corresponding to absolute magnitude @xmath36 ( rich cluster case from matteucci & gibson @xcite ) . as it was the case for a single galaxy , again the amount of the ejected element",
    "is increased by an order of magnitude for the flat imf .",
    "note that to convert numbers on @xmath37-axis into the total mass of the element ejected in the icm by all disk galaxies in the cluster , one should multiply them by @xmath38 .    to compare our results with the predictions about o and fe ejection from elliptical galaxies presented by matteucci & gibson ( @xcite ) we computed two models corresponding to their cases of a rich and poor cluster .",
    "parameters of these models and their results are listed in table  [ tabref ] .",
    "it is obvious that elliptical galaxies are the dominant source of heavy metals in rich clusters , while in poor clusters , rich in spirals , the latter ones catch up with ellipticals in iron production and exceed them in oxygen production .",
    "we shall return to this point in the next section .",
    "to check dependence of our results on the adopted parameters of the lf we computed oxygen and iron yields with @xmath39 and @xmath25 from marzke et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "evolution of o and fe ejected mass for this lf is also shown in fig .",
    "[ ofe3 ] . in this case production of both iron and oxygen",
    "is decreased by an order of magnitude . however , predicted mass of o and fe ejected into the icm by ellipticals would decrease , too , so this can not change results of comparison for the two morphological types .    [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ imlr ] we show iron and silicon mass in the clusters versus partial luminosity of spirals , ellipticals , and lenticulars ( all data needed to compute these quantities were taken from fukazawa et al . and arnaud et al . ) .",
    "these two plots reveal the surprising fact : both iron and silicon masses follow nearly the same path for all morphological types , with the only exception of ( perseus cluster ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that according to andreon ( @xcite ) the number of spirals in this cluster is underestimated by a factor of 2 or 3 .",
    "however , one might argue that the fact that iron ( or silicon ) mass in the cluster correlates with a partial luminosity of any morphological type is not so meaningful .",
    "renzini et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggested that it is the ratio of iron mass to cluster luminosity ( imlr ) that does make sense in studying the icm chemical evolution . if we plot fraction of spirals versus total luminosity for galaxies from arnaud et al .",
    "( @xcite ) sample ( fig .  [ fracspil ] ) , we see that in the range of luminosities from @xmath40 to @xmath41 fraction of spirals drops from 0.5 to approximately 0.1 .",
    "one might expect that the imlr should decrease in spiral - rich clusters because of decreasing number of metal sources .    to check if this is the case , we plot in fig .",
    "[ frac ] the icm iron mass to light ratio ( imlr ) and silicon mass to light ratio ( smlr ) versus fraction of spirals in galaxy clusters . in both cases",
    "there is an apparent correlation between these two values .",
    "however , it rests mainly upon the cluster which we have already mentioned .",
    "so , if we drop this cluster from consideration , figs  [ imlr ] and [ frac ] reveal that , first , iron and silicon masses in the galaxy clusters increase with the luminosity of _ any _ morphological type .",
    "second , there is no clear correlation between the imlr ( or smlr ) and a fraction of spirals in the cluster .",
    "in this paper we investigate the role played by disk galaxies in the chemical evolution of the icm .",
    "we show that if a mass of the galaxy does not exceed @xmath42 it contributes nearly the same amount of metals into the icm as an elliptical galaxy of comparable mass .",
    "however , we have found that massive spirals are able to retain their heavy elements and thus do not participate in the icm enrichment .",
    "integration of the heavy element yields of galaxies over the galactic mass spectrum shows that while ellipticals do play the determining role in the chemical evolution of rich clusters , spirals can be significant source of @xmath0 in poor clusters .",
    "we should mention briefly some moments which are important for future improvement of our model : there are evidences that the galactic mass function changed in time ( e.g. because of coalescense of early galaxies ) ; new important data on abundance of other chemical elements are expected from space experiments ; dynamical interaction of gas and galaxies in the clusters seems to be important and it should be investigated in more details ."
