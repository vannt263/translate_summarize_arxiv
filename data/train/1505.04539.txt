    "_ entanglement _ is a very special notion appearing only in quantum mechanics , which had been considered as what causes  spooky actions \" @xcite . however over these three decades it has gained a completely opposite impression , mainly thanks to the fact that it plays a central role in quantum information science .",
    "a particularly important application of entanglement in our context is the _ quantum metrology _ @xcite .",
    "its basic formulation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ q metrology ] .",
    "the goal is to estimate an unknown parameter @xmath0 contained in the system .",
    "a standard estimation method is first to send a known input state and then measure the output state containing the information about @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ q metrology ] ( a ) ) ; in this case the estimation error has a strict lower bound called the _",
    "standard quantum limit ( sql)_. in the quantum metrology schematic depicted in fig .",
    "[ q metrology ] ( b ) , on the other hand , an entangled state is chosen as an input and its one portion interacts with the system while the other portion does not ; then by measuring the combined output fields , we obtain more information about @xmath0 than the standard case ( fig .  [ q metrology ] ( a ) ) and thus can beat the sql in the estimation error .",
    "this schematic was experimentally demonstrated in several optical settings , e.g. @xcite .",
    "what we learn from the quantum metrology theory is that , in a broad sense , a quantum estimator could have better performance if assisted by entanglement .",
    "therefore it should be a reasonable idea to employ such an entanglement - assisted estimator in the measurement - based quantum feedback control @xcite , which is now well established based on the quantum filtering theory @xcite . actually , if the quantum filter gains more information by constructing a similar configuration depicted in fig .",
    "[ q metrology ]  ( b ) , it is highly expected that it offers a better estimate and as consequence a better control performance .",
    "the idea of this _ entanglement - assisted feedback control _ is briefly mentioned in the recent publication @xcite , but in fact there have been no study in the literature to examine how much it would be beneficial .",
    "( a ) standard setup for estimating an unknown parameter @xmath0 . ( b ) quantum metrology setup using an entangled input . ]    in this paper , for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the entanglement - assisted feedback control , we conduct a case study in the following setup .",
    "we consider a general linear quantum system such as an optical cavity and a large atomic ensemble @xcite , in which case the filter is simplified to the quantum kalman filter @xcite .",
    "the input is given by an optical entangled state generated by combining a squeezed field and a coherent field @xcite .",
    "the control goal is to minimize a quadratic - type cost function .",
    "that is , we consider the quantum linear quadratic gaussian ( lqg ) optimal control problem ; fortunately , we can analytically solve this problem by almost the same way as in the classical case @xcite .",
    "a clear advantage of this formulation is that a strict lower bound of the cost , which is achievable by employing the so - called _ cheap control _",
    "@xcite , is represented by a function of only the estimation error .",
    "hence the ultimate achievable limit of the lqg control cost can be evaluated by only examining the filter .    here",
    "we describe two important features of the proposed control configuration .",
    "first , we explicitly take into account the amount of usable energy for generating the input field ; this allows us to compare the performance of the entanglement - assisted feedback control scheme to that of the standard method with a non - entangled input state yet having the same amount of energy .",
    "second , the model contains an optical loss in the system s output channel .",
    "in fact , for some systems such as a super - conductivity circuit , the system s output field can easily get diminished along the output waveguide before arriving at the detector .",
    "based on the above - mentioned formulation , we examine a numerical simulation . the system is a nano - mechanical oscillator @xcite , which is cast as an important platform demonstrating several quantum information processing . for those purposes",
    "it is necessary to reduce ( i.e. _ cool _ ) the energy of the oscillator toward its motional ground state .",
    "in fact we demonstrate that the entanglement - assisted feedback control has effectiveness in this cooling problem , particularly when the system s output field is lossy .",
    "finally , we note that the scheme presented in this paper differs from that studied in the recent paper @xcite , which considers the use of system s _ internal _ entanglement to enhance the cooling .",

    "@xmath2 : @xmath3 identity matrix .",

    "@xmath5 : @xmath6 zero matrix .",
    "we here review the general theory of quantum kalman filtering and lqg optimal control .",
    "in this paper we deal with a linear quantum system , whose general form is given as follows .",
    "the system variables are collected in a vector of operators @xmath7^\\top$ ] , where the infinite - dimensional operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 have physical meanings of position and momentum .",
    "they satisfy the canonical commutation relation ( ccr ) @xmath10 ( we set @xmath11 ) , which are summarized as @xmath12.\\ ] ] the system variables are governed by the linear dynamics @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a vector of classical ( i.e. non - quantum ) signal representing the control input .",
    "further , we have an associated measurement signal : @xmath15    equations and have some special features that do not appear in the classical case . first , the noise term @xmath16 is a vector of operators @xmath17^\\top$ ] that satisfies the following ito rule : @xmath18 .",
    "( the mean is zero : @xmath19 . )",
    "the correlation matrix @xmath20 is @xmath21 block - diagonal hermitian , and their @xmath22th block matrix ( i.e. the correlation matrix of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) is in general written as @xmath25.\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 satisfy @xmath28 .",
    "also note that @xmath29 .",
    "another feature is that , due to the ccr of @xmath30 , the system matrices of eqs .   and",
    "have specific structure represented by @xmath31 @xmath32 is the @xmath33-dimensional block diagonal matrix defined by @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 is @xmath36 real symmetric and @xmath37 is @xmath38 real ; they are determined by the system s hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath39 is an @xmath40 real matrix satisfying @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 does not have special structure . for more details , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "note that , when @xmath43 , the output is simply a noise process @xmath44 , implying that the dynamics must be subjected to a noise if we want to gain some information about the system .",
    "let us consider the situation where we want to estimate the system variable @xmath30 through the output signal @xmath45 .",
    "it is indeed possible that , thanks to the quantum filtering theory , we can rigorously define the quantum conditional expectation @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the @xmath48-algebra composed of the collection of @xmath45 up to time @xmath49 .",
    "note that @xmath50 is a classical random variable and is the least mean squared estimate of @xmath30 .",
    "the recursive equation updating @xmath50 is given by the following quantum kalman filter : @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "likewise the classical case , @xmath53 represents the innovation process .",
    "also @xmath54 is the error covariance matrix defined as @xmath55 @xmath54 evolves in time according to the following riccati differential equation : @xmath56      in the infinite horizon lqg control problem , we consider the following cost function : @xmath57         = \\lim_{t\\rightarrow \\infty }            \\frac{1}{t }            \\biggl \\langle             \\int_0^t ( { \\hat x}_t^\\top q { \\hat",

    "the goal is to design the feedback control law of @xmath14 that minimizes the cost , i.e. @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "now the point is that , due to the tower property @xmath61 , the cost function can be represented in terms of the filter variable as @xmath62        = \\lim_{t\\rightarrow \\infty }            \\frac{1}{t }           \\biggl \\langle             \\int_0^t \\big ( \\pi(\\hat{x}_t)^\\top q \\pi(\\hat{x}_t )                          + u_t^\\top ru_t \\big)dt \\biggr \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{5em }       \\mbox { }             + { { \\rm tr}\\hspace{0.07cm}}(qv_\\infty).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second term is constant , since @xmath54 does not depend on @xmath14 .",
    "hence , our problem is to find @xmath14 minimizing the first term of eq .   under the condition",
    "this is exactly the classical lqg control problem , thus the solution is given by @xmath63 note that @xmath64 is a function of the optimal estimate @xmath50 , implying that we can design the optimal estimate and control separately ; this is called the separation principle as in the classical case .",
    "the minimum value of the cost is given by @xmath65         = { { \\rm tr}\\hspace{0.07cm}}(k_\\infty d\\re(\\theta ) d^\\top k_\\infty^\\top p_\\infty )           + { { \\rm tr}\\hspace{0.07cm}}(qv_\\infty).\\ ] ]      let us take @xmath66 in the cost function ; this means that no penalty is imposed on the magnitude of the control input @xmath14 , and thus the resulting optimal control is called the cheap control .",
    "then , if the system is minimum phase and right invertible , the first term of the minimum cost can be arbitrarily made small by the cheap control ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the strict lower bound of the minimum lqg cost is given by @xmath67 = { { \\rm tr}\\hspace{0.07cm}}(qv_\\infty).\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "this means that the stationary energy @xmath68 can be ultimately reduced , by the ideal cheap control , to @xmath69 , which is a function of only the optimal estimation error and can not be further suppressed by any control .",
    "the entanglement - assisted feedback control configuration considered in this paper is depicted in fig .  [ general setup ] .",
    "this model has the following special features .",
    "\\(i ) the system is linear and has a single input - output channel .",
    "\\(ii ) the entangled optical field is produced by combining a coherent squeezed field @xmath70 with fixed squeezing level @xmath71 and a coherent field @xmath72 , at a beam splitter ( bs1 ) with reflectivity @xmath73 .",
    "it is known that , for all @xmath74 , the output fields of bs1 are entangled . as shown in the figure , one portion of this entangled field couples with the system , while the other portion does not and will be measured directly .",
    "we can change the entanglement level by tuning @xmath75 , while maintaining the total amount of energy for creating the squeezed state .",
    "hence we can conduct a fair comparison of the entanglement - assisted method and the standard method without entanglement , given the same amount of energy .",
    "note that the amplitude of @xmath70 and @xmath72 are changed depending on @xmath75 , so that each output field of bs1 has a constant amplitude .",

    "@xmath82 and @xmath83 are the phases of homodyne detectors .",
    "the signal path from the controller to the system is not shown . ]",
    "in this section we conduct a numerical simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed entanglement - assisted feedback control scheme .",
    "the system of interest is a nano - mechanical oscillator connected to an optical cavity shown in fig .",

    "in addition , we assume that the oscillator is subjected to a thermal environment with its mean photon number @xmath122 .",
    "this brings modification of some system matrices ; particularly in our case we need to change the @xmath96 matrix to @xmath123 and the constant term in the ricatti equation  , @xmath124 , to @xmath125 , where @xmath126 represents the system - environment coupling strength and @xmath127 .",
    "finally we assume that the oscillator can be directly controlled , for instance by applying an auxiliary laser field , so that the system satisfies the conditions for the cheap control ; equivalently , we assume the existence of the matrix @xmath42 satisfying those conditions .",
    "nano - mechanical oscillator coupled to the entangled field . ]",
    "our control goal is to cool the oscillator toward its motional ground state ; i.e. , we want to minimize the stationary energy ( more precisely , the effective stationary excitation number ) of the oscillator , which is defined by @xmath128 as described in sec .",
    "ii - d , this can be ultimately reduced , by the ideal cheap control , to @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the above - defined diagonal matrix and @xmath131 is the stationary solution of the riccati equation . in the simulation",
    "we evaluate eq .   with several parameters .",
    "the system parameters are set to typical values found in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) ; in the unit of @xmath132 , we take @xmath133 , @xmath134 ( bad cavity regime ) , and @xmath135 ( red detuned driving ) . the oscillator is subjected to a thermal noise with mean photon number @xmath136 with coupling strength @xmath137 , implying that the oscillator has a high q factor and is subjected to a very low temperature environment .",
    "the squeezed coherent field has squeezing level @xmath138 ( 10 db squeezing ) , which is enough achievable in the current technology .     the achievable lowest energy of the oscillator , @xmath139 , versus the reflectivity of bs1 in the case @xmath140 .",
    "the red solid line shows the case @xmath86 ( local measurement ) , while the black dotted line shows the case @xmath141 ( global measurement ) . ]",
    "figure  [ sim fig ] shows @xmath139 as a function of the reflectivity of the first beam splitter , @xmath73 , in the case @xmath140 ; that is , the system s output field is very lossy .",
    "the reflectivity @xmath73 represents how much the squeezed light field is split into two arms , which determines the amount of entanglement .",
    "note that when @xmath142 or @xmath143 , the input light fields are not entangled .",
    "in particular , @xmath143 corresponds to the standard case where only the coherent light field is injected to the system ; hence the value of @xmath139 in this case has the meaning of sql , which is now @xmath144 as indicated in the figure .",
    "@xmath139 is calculated by solving the ricatti equation , and further , it is minimized with respect to the phases of the two homodyne detectors ( i.e. @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) at each @xmath75 . in the figure the red solid line and the black dotted line correspond to the case @xmath86 ( local measurement ) and @xmath147 ( global measurement ) , respectively .",
    "notably , in both cases the minimum of @xmath139 is attained at around @xmath148 , in which case the input field is entangled .",
    "hence the entanglement - assisted feedback method realizes further cooling below the sql .",
    "note that controlling with the local measurement ( @xmath86 ) shows better performance over the global one ( @xmath141 ) ; in fact in the simulation we found that the local measurement is the best strategy to reduce the energy . in general",
    "a global measurement has a meaning of  quantum measurement \" in the sense that it can cause non - classical effects such as entanglement ; but in our scenario such quantum measurement is not useful .",
    "finally , we should remark that simply injecting the squeezed field into the system without entanglement ( i.e. @xmath142 ) is the worst case having no benefit in cooling .",
    "next fig .",
    "[ sim fig 2 ] shows the case @xmath149 , i.e. we assume that the optical loss in the output channel is relatively small . in this case , we found in the simulation that , for any choice of @xmath150 , the sql ( @xmath151 ) provides almost the lowest energy , as particularly indicated by two lines corresponding to the cases @xmath86 and @xmath141 .",
