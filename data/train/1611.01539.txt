    "<S> belitz - kirkpatrick - vojta ( bkv ) theory shows in excellent agreement with experiment that ferromagnetic quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) in clean metals are generally first - order due to the coupling of the magnetization to electronic soft modes , in contrast to the classical analogue that is an archetypical second - order phase transition . for disordered metals bkv theory </S>",

    "<S> our low - temperature magnetization study identifies the ferromagnetic qpt in the disordered metal  as the first clear example that exhibits the associated critical exponents predicted by bkv theory .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) have been a topic of intense research efforts for several decades @xcite . here the earliest theory of a qpt was provided by stoner in 1938 for itinerant ferromagnets @xcite . due to the exotic behavior frequently observed in the vicinity of ferromagnetic qpts in metals , such as unconventional spin - triplet superconductivity  @xcite , partial magnetic order @xcite , and topological non - fermi liquid behavior @xcite , </S>",

    "<S> however , at the turn of the century , an extension of the hertz - millis theory by belitz , kirkpatrick and votja ( bkv ) demonstrated in remarkable agreement with experiments that a qpt in two and three dimensions from a paramagnetic to homogeneous ferromagnetic state is generically discontinuous ( or first - order ) provided that the underlying metal is sufficiently clean @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the responsible mechanism is the coupling of the magnetization to electronic soft modes that universally exist in metals , which in turn leads to a fluctuation - induced first - order transition . </S>",
    "<S> we note that fluctuation - induced first - order transitions are broadly important in solid - state physics and even beyond  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> bkv theory further reveals the existence of a tricritical point that separates a line of first - order transitions at low temperature from a line of second order transitions at higher temperatures when the non - thermal control parameter @xmath0 that provides access to the qpt is varied . including the effects of an external magnetic field @xmath1 in the bkv calculations generates tricritical wings that emerge from the tricritical point as a function of magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting unique temperature @xmath2 vs @xmath0 and @xmath1 phase diagram has been observed in experiments on many clean ferromagnetic metals , making bkv theory one of the most successful theories of qpts @xcite .    because in a large number of itinerant ferromagnets the qpt may be accessed via chemical substitution , and some materials show incipient disorder , considering the effect of disorder on the nature of a ferromagnetic qpt is crucial . if the disorder is sufficiently strong , the nature of the electronic soft modes changes from ballistic to diffusive . </S>",
    "<S> this slowing - down of the itinerant electrons promotes ferromagnetism . according to bkv theory , this results in the suppression of the tricritical point to zero temperature and </S>",
    "<S> the resulting qpt is second - order  @xcite , with critical exponents that suggest the transition is even more continuous than in hertz - millis theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although most disordered ferromagnetic metals exhibit second - order qpts , the critical exponents predicted by bkv theory ( reviewed below ) have never been observed consistently .    in this letter , we demonstrate that the critical behavior observed at a ferromagnetic qpt in  that is accessed via chemical substitution of co with fe is in excellent agreement with bkv theory .  </S>",

    "<S> the observed increased values of the residual resistivity ( @xmath11  420  @xmath12cm)@xcite suggest a significant amount of disorder making  an ideal candidate to look for the critical exponents predicted by bkv theory for disordered metals . in our previous study , the magnetization near the qpt was found to scale as @xmath13(@xmath14  k , @xmath1 )  @xmath15 as function of @xmath1 . here </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding critical exponent was determined to be @xmath16  3/2 in agreement with bkv theory for a disordered qpt . because strictly speaking the exponent @xmath17 takes on the value associated with the qpt only for @xmath18 , this has motivated our present study of @xmath13(@xmath2 , @xmath1 ) down to much lower temperatures . </S>",

    "<S> the eds analysis ( see supplemental material @xcite ) shows that they are indeed chemically homogeneous , where in particular the nominal fe concentration @xmath0 agrees with the fe concentration @xmath20 within the error bar . </S>",

    "<S> that it will determine the observable behavior over sizable regions of the phase diagram in many disordered materials @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> however , because the phase transition rapidly becomes extremely broad for @xmath60 , the scaling of @xmath58 near @xmath10 can not be precisely determined .    to summarize , the salient findings of our study are : ( i ) the critical exponent @xmath17 defined via @xmath13(@xmath26 , @xmath1 )  @xmath15 is equal to 3/2 for the critical fe concentration @xmath45 and is significantly smaller than 3/2 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 slightly away from the qpt ; ( ii ) our data are in excellent agreement with the critical exponents @xmath37 and @xmath38 that describe the temperature - scaling of @xmath13(@xmath2 , @xmath1 ) being 1 and 1/2 for @xmath25 , and 3/4 and 5/8 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ; ( iii ) our results are consistent with the qpt being at or in the very near vicinity of @xmath45 ; ( iv ) the asymptotic and pre - asymptotic regions are situated at fe concentration @xmath61 and @xmath57 , respectively ; ( v ) the @xmath6 is found to scale as @xmath43 for a wide range of @xmath0 with @xmath44 consistent with a hertz s fixed point and in agreement with bkv theory . </S>",
    "<S> this establishes that  is the first metal that exhibits critical behavior near a ferromagnetic qpt accessed by chemical substitution that is in complete agreement with the predictions of bkv theory for a metal with significant disorder .    for completeness </S>",
    "<S> , we note that a critical exponent @xmath34 has already been observed in uru@xmath62re@xmath63si@xmath64  @xcite and sr@xmath65a@xmath63ruo@xmath66 @xcite at @xmath2 = 1.8 k and @xmath67  k , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> however , these results were obtained at finite temperature , whereas the result of bkv theory is only valid for @xmath26 and in immediate vicinity of the qpt . </S>",
    "<S> notably , for uru@xmath62re@xmath63si@xmath64 , the qpt is situated at @xmath68 but @xmath34 was obtained for @xmath69  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , all other exponents @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath56 either do not agree with bkv theory  @xcite or were not determined .    in conclusion , our results demonstrate that metals with significant disorder exhibit second - order ferromagnetic qpts that are more continuous than in hertz - millis theory . </S>",
    "<S> this establishes for the first time that bkv theory not only describes clean materials extremely well , but is also able to calculate the critical exponents for disordered metals . </S>",
    "<S> our work also identifies several reasons why no other disordered materials have been reported to show bkv critical exponents . </S>",
    "<S> most notably , it is difficult to achieve the right amount of disorder to observe such behavior ; for too small disorder , the tricritical point remains at non - zero temperatures and no quantum critical behavior occurs . in contrast , for too strong disorder , quantum griffiths effects that compete with the critical behavior are expected  @xcite . moreover , there is currently no clear method of determining disorder quantitatively to allow for comparison with theory , and choosing a suitable material is challenging . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the often used residual resistivity ratio is only useful in comparing the disorder for different specimens of the same material , and is not meaningful for distinct materials . </S>",
    "<S> further , as shown in detail here , special diligence is required to obtain meaningful critical exponents , as typical magnetization measurements are too insensitive to choose a single set of critical exponents ( see supplemental material @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , for , we have shown that the asymptotic scaling is only observed in a tiny region around the qpt  @xcite , which implies that great care is required to identify this region . </S>",
    "<S> however , our study may provide a recipe for identifying further disordered metals that exhibit bkv critical exponents near a ferromagnetic qpt .    </S>",
