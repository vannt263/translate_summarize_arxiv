    "for many decades , the kondo model has attracted a great amount of interest in condensed matter physics .",
    "the kondo effect was first discovered@xcite and analyzed@xcite in bulk metals which contain magnetic impurities , where the exchange coupling @xmath1 between a localized spin-@xmath2 and the conduction electrons leads to a screening of the spin and to an increased resistivity at low temperatures ( see ref .   for a review ) .",
    "more recently , it was first predicted theoretically@xcite and then confirmed experimentally@xcite that the kondo effect also occurs in quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime , where the net spin on the dot can form a single impurity that is exchange - coupled to the conduction electrons in two or more reservoirs .",
    "it turns out that the kondo effect causes an enhancement of the conductance through the quantum dot at low temperatures , and that the conductance can reach the unitary value @xmath3 for very low temperatures and zero bias voltage.@xcite quantum dots do not only permit us to control the coupling between the impurity to the conduction electrons , but also allow us to study the behavior of the impurity in a nonequilibrium setup by applying a finite bias voltage.@xcite      from a theoretical point of view , the kondo model can be deduced from the single impurity anderson model by integrating out the charge degrees of freedom using the schrieffer - wolff transformation.@xcite various methods have been applied to the anderson and kondo models in three different regimes :    [ [ equilibrium . ] ] equilibrium .",
    "methods that have been applied successfully to the anderson and kondo models in equilibrium include fermi - liquid theory,@xcite the bethe ansatz,@xcite conformal field theory,@xcite and the numerical renormalization group@xcite ( nrg ) .",
    "an important result is that the zero bias conductance @xmath4 through a single impurity at finite temperature is unitary at @xmath5 , @xmath6 and is a universal function of the ratio @xmath7 , where the kondo temperature @xmath8 is a characteristic energy scale that governs the low - energy behavior of the impurity . in two - loop poor man scaling methods @xcite it",
    "is defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the band width of the reservoirs , and @xmath11 is the exchange coupling between the impurity spin and the conduction electrons .",
    "the kondo temperature is related to the width of the peak in @xmath4 at @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , a precise definition of a characteristic low - energy scale is the temperature for which the conductance drops to half its maximum value : @xmath12 we denote this energy scale by @xmath13 , in contrast to @xmath8 which is not uniquely defined in the literature .",
    "[ [ expansions - in - the - strong - coupling - regime . ] ] expansions in the strong coupling regime .    in the case that both temperature and voltage are much smaller than the kondo temperature , fermi liquid theory has been used@xcite to obtain an expansion of the differential conductance up to second order in @xmath7 and @xmath14 .",
    "the result is @xmath15 where the ratio of the coefficients @xmath16 and @xmath17 is @xmath18 for the ratio of @xmath16 and @xmath17 it is not important which definition of @xmath8 is chosen . if one uses the energy scale @xmath13 instead of @xmath8 in the expansion we write @xmath19 this defines uniquely the coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which are universal numbers ( i.e. independent of the details of the high - energy cutoff function ) of @xmath22 .",
    "recently , the coefficient @xmath20 has been determined from very precise numerical renormalization group calculations with the result @xcite @xmath23 which serves as a quality benchmark for the reliabilty of other many - body methods in the regime of very low energies .",
    "a delicate issue for the precise calculation of these coefficients is the fact that the band width @xmath10 has to be many orders of magnitude larger than the kondo temperature @xmath8 in order to obtain universal results in the scaling limit @xmath24 numerically , as explained in ref .",
    ", it is very difficult to achieve this for the kondo model whereas for the underlying anderson impurity model it has only recently become possible to extrapolate the universal value of @xmath20.@xcite in this paper , we will show that our analytical method allows for a different way to achieve universality directly for the kondo model .",
    "[ [ weak - coupling - regime . ] ] weak coupling regime .",
    "if there is an energy scale in the system , such as the temperature , the voltage , or the magnetic field , which is much larger than the kondo temperature , perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) methods can be used .",
    "they perform an expansion of the physical quantities in terms of a renormalized , but still small , coupling , provided that the rg flow of the coupling does not cause divergencies .",
    "these methods were pioneered by poor man s scaling@xcite and include the following :    * scaling methods that include a phenomenological decay rate @xmath25 as a cutoff for the rg flow.@xcite * the flow equations method , where the competition between terms of different orders in the coupling constant prevents divergencies during the rg flow.@xcite * the real time renormalization group ( rtrg ) , which , unlike the previous methods , can explain the emergence of a decay rate @xmath25 even in the lowest order truncation of the rg equations .",
    "the rtrg has been used with either the reservoir bandwidth@xcite or an imaginary frequency cutoff , which cuts off the matsubara poles of the fermi distribution function,@xcite as the flow parameter .",
    "recently , attempts have been made to fill the gap between the well - understood strong coupling and weak coupling regimes of the nonequilibrium kondo model .",
    "the rtrg , which had been applied earlier to the kondo model in the weak coupling regime , has recently been used with the fourier variable @xmath26 as the flow paramter to consider the kondo model at arbitrary voltage and zero temperature , and vice versa.@xcite this @xmath26-flow scheme of the rtrg is able to reproduce the nrg results for the equilibrium conductance up to deviations of a few percent , and yields results for the nonequilibrium conductance which are consistent both with fermi - liquid theory in the strong coupling regime , and with weak coupling expansions .",
    "the results were also in agreement with measurements of the differential conductance in an inas nanowire quantum dot.@xcite moreover , ref .",
    "predicted that the nonequilibrium differential conductance @xmath27 at zero temperature and a voltage that matches the energy scale @xmath13 as defined by eq .",
    "is approximately two thirds of the unitary conductance : @xmath28 this prediction , which has been confirmed by recent experiments,@xcite provides an alternative way to determine the kondo temperature @xmath13 of a system in an experiment , which is usually much simpler to perform because all measurements can be done at constant temperature . using the @xmath26-flow scheme of rtrg , similiar results were recently obtained for the @xmath29 kondo model,@xcite where eq .",
    "changes to @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , from the voltage dependence of the conductance at zero temperature one can define an energy scale @xmath31 as the voltage for which the conductance drops to half its maximum value @xmath32 correspondingly one can define fermi liquid coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 by taking the scale @xmath31 as reference scale @xmath35 an interesting issue is the determination of the universal ratio of the two energy scales @xmath13 and @xmath31 , from which one can determine the absolute values of the universal fermi liquid coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 via @xmath36    a keldysh effective action theory has recently been applied to a highly unsymmetrical anderson model , which prohibits double occupancy of the impurity .  @xcite the method supports the prediction   and has recently been extended to the situation where the temperature , the voltage , and the magnetic field are",
    "all non - zero.@xcite    another perturbative method to describe universal scaling at low and intermediate energy scales has been proposed in ref .  , where the @xmath37 approximation within the @xmath38 formalism has been used for the symmetric anderson model .",
    "they predicted a value for the ratio @xmath39 , which is quite close to the result @xmath40 obtained by our method .",
    "other studies of the nonequilibrium anderson impurity model exist ( see , e.g. , refs .   and for reviews ) .",
    "however , these suffer from the problem that the coulomb interaction can not be chosen arbitrarily large , or , equivalently , the corresponding kondo exchange coupling @xmath11 can not be made arbitrarily small .",
    "this hinders achievement of universality in the scaling limit .",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold . in the first part",
    ", we will describe in all detail the idea of the @xmath26-flow scheme of the rtrg , as proposed in ref .  .",
    "we note that this scheme is essentially different from the one developed in ref .  , where a cutoff of the matsubara poles of the fermi functions was used , and the rg equations were derived by the principle of invariance when reducing the cutoff . in contrast , the @xmath26-flow scheme uses the fourier variable @xmath26 itself as flow parameter , yielding a physical result for all quantities at each stage of the rg flow .",
    "the technical derivation of the rg equations is very different compared to ref .   since one does not make use of the principle of invariance .",
    "instead , one can set up directly a systematic and well - defined perturbative expansion of the derviatives of all physical quantities w.r.t .",
    "@xmath26 in terms of the effective two - point vertex .",
    "since @xmath26 can be considered in the whole complex plane , the rg equations can be solved along arbitrary paths in the complex plane .",
    "this provides a natural scheme to define analytic continuations of all retarded quantities into the lower half of the complex plane , even on a pure numerical level . for these reasons ,",
    "the @xmath26-flow scheme is a natural rg scheme capable of addressing the physics of nonequilibrium stationary states , together with the full time evolution starting from an initially uncoupled system from the reservoirs ( for more general initial conditions for quantum quenches and time - dependent hamiltonians , see refs .   and  ) .",
    "technically , the @xmath26-flow scheme allows for a systematic resummation of all logarithmic divergencies at high and low energies ( i.e. , short and long times ) simultaneously and provides the possibility to solve the rg flow also starting from the infrared regime .",
    "as we will explain below , the latter turns out to be important to determine the universal part of the solution . the supplementary part of ref .   contains a short description of the ideas of the @xmath26-flow scheme , whereas the present paper will reveal all technical details .",
    "moreover , we will also go beyond ref .   and develop a scheme which can be generalized to all orders and we will show that it is sufficient to set up a systematic power series in terms of the frequency - independent two - point vertex only .",
    "we will focus on fermions and consider the case of a generic quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime ( i.e. , charge fluctuations are suppressed ) which is coupled to noninteracting reservoirs with a flat density of states ( dos ) .",
    "other extensions for charge fluctuations or frequency - dependent dos are also possible and have recently been started in connection with the interacting resonant level model @xcite and the ohmic spin - boson model.@xcite    an important issue of this paper concerns universality , i.e. , the way how one can set up the scaling limit , which determines that part of the solution which is independent of the specific choice of the high - energy cutoff function . whereas the limit @xmath41 can be performed directly for the rg equations ( since all frequency integrals are convergent )",
    ", it is necessary to find appropriate universal initial or boundary conditions to solve the differential equations .",
    "this is achieved by using a perturbative calculation for various quantities at high energies , together with the boundary condition of unitary conductance for @xmath42 . in this way ,",
    "no specific form for the high - energy cutoff function is needed . in comparison to ref .",
    ", we propose an improved scheme to set up the initial conditions which , for the kondo model , guarantees universality already for exchange couplings of the order of @xmath43 , i.e. , by using eq .  , for @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , we will discuss critically the crucial issue why the @xmath26-flow scheme can sometimes even provide quantitatively reliable information for the strong coupling regime although the rg equations are truncated in a perturbative manner .",
    "we will explain why this issue is related to the complex nature of the flow parameter @xmath26 such that the stationary case is not related to any fixed point of the rg but corresponds to some intermediate point in the rg flow where the solution is still analytic in @xmath26 .",
    "in contrast , the fixed points correspond to a flow parameter @xmath45 , where @xmath46 are the oscillation frequencies and @xmath47 the relaxation / decoherence rates of the time evolution .    in the second part of the paper",
    ", we will apply the @xmath26-flow scheme to the special case of the isotropic spin-@xmath0 and @xmath48-channel kondo model in nonequilibrium at zero magnetic field .",
    "in contrast to ref .  , we will consider the general case that both temperature and voltage are non - zero ( and not only one of these scales ) and analyze the interplay between temperature and voltage .",
    "we discuss situations where this interplay leads to a nonmonotonic temperature - dependence of the conductance at fixed finite voltage , and compare our results to recent experiments .",
    "furthermore , due to our improved scheme for the inital conditions , we will present a new result for the universal coefficient @xmath21 and compare it to the known result .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the deviation in third order truncation is only @xmath49 , providing evidence that our solution for the nonlinear conductance is reliable in the whole range of voltages .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "as shown below this expansion can be achieved by a unique resummation of certain subclasses of diagrams which has also the effect that only the full effective liouvillian @xmath180 occurs in this series .",
    "most importantly , we will show that if the second derivative is taken for the effective liouvillian , the resulting series does no longer contain any logarithmic divergence at high energies , such that we can take the limit @xmath41 to calculate the frequency integrals of any diagram in any order of the effective vertices .",
    "the same can be shown to hold for the _ first derivative _ of the effective vertices such that the rg equations within the @xmath26-flow scheme can be symbolically written as @xmath181 where @xmath182 denote some functionals which have to be determined from the diagrammatic rules , see the next section .",
    "we note that the rg equations involve only the two - point vertex @xmath177 , whereas in ref .",
    "a set of coupled rg equations for all @xmath156-point vertices occur .",
    "moreover , as we will see in the next section , it can be shown that the right - hand side of the rg equations can be rewritten as a well - defined power series in terms of the _ frequency - independent _ two - point vertex only ( i.e. the index @xmath48 no longer involves the frequency ) .",
    "this simplifies the analysis of the rg equations in higher order truncation schemes beyond third order .",
    "similar rg equations can be set up to calculate the effective current kernel and vertex . since the limit @xmath41 can be taken , these rg equations are universal , i.e. , are independent of the specific choice of the high - energy cutoff function .",
    "if this limit is taken , the rg equations are only valid in the regime @xmath183 and a corresponding initial condition has to be set up in this regime . in principle , it is also possible to include the high - energy cutoff function on the right - hand side of the rg equations and , such that the rg equations are valid for all values of @xmath26 in the complex plane and can include a specific microscopic choice to describe the physics at high energies . in this case , the initial conditions of the rg equations at @xmath184 with @xmath185 are just given by the bare values of the liouvillian and the vertices .",
    "however , the advantage of the @xmath26-flow scheme is that the scaling limit can be built in directly such that the limit @xmath41 can be performed from the very beginning before solving the rg equations , and only the universal part of the solution is obtained . to achieve this",
    ", we need to find an appropriate initial condition for @xmath186 . in this regime and",
    "neglecting terms of @xmath187 , the bare perturbation series will contain the band width @xmath10 only within the logarithmic terms @xmath166 .",
    "all these logarithmic terms are generated by the universal rg equations , if @xmath188 is used as initial value .",
    "therefore , in order to set up universal initial conditions , we set @xmath188 in the bare perturbation series _",
    "after _ having neglected all terms of @xmath189 , in order to remove all logarithmic and nonuniversal terms in the initial condition .",
    "furthermore , @xmath10 is taken much larger than all other physical energy scales to avoid nonuniversal terms of @xmath190 .",
    "in addition , we consider only those lowest order terms of the perturbative expansion which are universal , i.e. , independent of the choice of the high - energy cutoff function .",
    "if the lowest - order term is non - universal we take zero for the initial condition . as a consequence of this procedure ,",
    "only the universal part of the solution is picked out and the band width @xmath10 enters only as initial value @xmath188 of the fourier variabe but does not appear explicitly in the initial value of the liouvillian or the vertices .",

    ", the effective liouvillian can be decomposed in two terms @xmath192 where @xmath193 contains all terms proportional to some physical scale except @xmath26 , and @xmath194 contains all terms proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "the quantities @xmath195 and @xmath196 are slowly varying logarithmic functions in @xmath26 , and the above procedure to determine the initial condition at @xmath188 can be applied to them .",
    "however , setting @xmath188 in leads to a term @xmath197 proportional to @xmath10 itself",
    ". furthermore , it turns out that the coefficient in front of this term is non - universal for the kondo problem .",
    "neglecting this term in the initial condition would lead to a large error since the term diverges linearly in @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , we have to find a different way to set up the initial condition for @xmath137 .",
    "one way is to set up directly rg equations for the quantities @xmath195 and @xmath196 as proposed in ref .  , which can be used very effectively for a generic weak - coupling solution of the rg equations .",
    "@xcite however , the decomposition is not unique and some ambiguity is left to describe problems in strong coupling .",
    "therefore , for the kondo problem , we choose here a different strategy by first solving the rg equations , when all other physical scales @xmath162 are set to zero , and starting the rg flow at @xmath173 .",
    "this point corresponds to the stationary case , and it is known exactly that the conductance is unitary at this point .",
    "this boundary condition is used as an input to fix the unknown initial condition of the liouvillian .",
    "the rg flow is then first solved for @xmath198 starting from @xmath173 up to @xmath188 and the result is used as initial condition for the rg flow at finite @xmath199 .",
    "since the rg equations involve the liouvillian and the two - point vertex at the shifted variables @xmath200 , an initial condition is needed for all these values . in ref .  , the same initial condition has been taken at all these points but , for the kondo model , it turns out that for this choice the solution of the rg equations in the low energy regime @xmath201 is not independent of the initial value @xmath188 even if @xmath10 differs by many orders of magnitude from the physical scales @xmath202 .",
    "the problem is that there is an instability of the low - energy solution against exponentially small changes ( of the order of @xmath8 ) of the liouvillian at high energies .",
    "therefore , the relative difference between @xmath137 and @xmath203 , with @xmath204 , is important and can not be neglected for large @xmath26 at fixed voltage @xmath79 . in this paper",
    ", we will solve this problem by solving the rg equations at @xmath205 from @xmath173 up to @xmath188 and , subsequently , from @xmath188 to @xmath206 , providing different initial conditions for all quantities at the shifted variables . using this procedure",
    ", one finds that the scaling limit is achieved already for values of the exchange coupling of the order of @xmath43 , i.e. , by using eq .",
    ", for @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath26-flow scheme is a new concept in rg methods , since it uses a complex flow parameter .",
    "this allows the solution of the rg equations along an arbitrary path in the complex plane and all effective quantities can be analytically continued from the upper to the lower half of the complex plane .",
    "only if a branching point is encircled the solution does not return to the same value .",
    "thus , even numerically one can determine the precise position of all branching points and can fix the shape of the branch cuts in a convenient way . to calculate the time evolution",
    "it is not necessary to calculate the integrals in eqs .   and along the real axis which is numerically not very convenient due to strongly oscillating integrands .",
    "choosing the shape of the branch cuts along the negative imaginary axis starting from a branching point / pole of the resolvent @xmath147 $ ] at position @xmath207 , one can close the integration contour of and in the lower half of the complex plane and can address each individual term of the time evolution separately by calculating the integration around each individual branch cut .",
    "this requires the knowledge of the effective liouvillian for @xmath208 , with @xmath209 , which can be determined by solving the rg equations along the path @xmath210 starting at @xmath211 down to @xmath212 .",
    "using for @xmath94 , the branch cut integral leads to a term @xmath213 for the time evolution , where the position of the branching point / pole determines the exponential and @xmath214 is a pre - exponential function given by @xmath215 a similar equation holds for the time evolution for the current by using eq .  .",
    "due to the exponentially decaying integrand , the long time behavior of @xmath214 can be determined by analyzing the scaling behavior of the liouvillian close to the branching point @xmath216 .",
    "@xcite since each term of the time evolution has a different oscillation frequency and a different decay rate due to different positions of the branching points , it is very hard to distinguish the different terms if a method is used which can only calculate the sum of all terms .",
    "thus , the @xmath26-flow scheme is a very natural and effective scheme for a systematic determination of the time dynamics for problems in dissipative quantum mechanics .    within the @xmath26-flow scheme , also",
    "the notion of fixed points of the rg flow has to be generalized . in conventional rg methods ,",
    "the flow parameter is a real cutoff @xmath217 and the fixed points are defined as those points where the rg flow of all quantities stops for @xmath218 . within the @xmath26-flow scheme , there is no unique path for the flow parameter . for",
    "each given set of initial conditions , there is a certain set of branching points @xmath216 in the lower half of the complex plane where the rg flow stops .",
    "thus , if the rg flow is solved along the path @xmath219 , the fixed point is defined as the value of all quantities which is obtained for @xmath218 .",
    "this means that the fixed point itself is associated with @xmath216 such that @xmath216 can be equivalently called a fixed point .",
    "if the initial conditions are changed then also the position of the branching points can change , i.e. , it makes no sense in general to associate several fixed points with a single branching point .",
    "therefore , in the following , we will denote the branching points as fixed points of the rg . as already mentioned above",
    ", the scaling behavior around these fixed points determines the long - time behavior of pre - exponential functions for the time evolution .",
    "the stationary solution requires only the knowledge of the effective liouvillian ( or the effective current kernel ) close to @xmath173 , see eqs .   and .",
    "around this point the effective liouvillian is analytic for the isotropic @xmath48-channel kondo model , where the branching points are located at @xmath220 .",
    "therefore , in contrast to other rg methods , the rg flow is still sufficiently away from the fixed points , and the expansion in @xmath26 , @xmath133 , or @xmath79 is analytic around this point .",
    "this is the reason why even for the strong coupling case @xmath221 , there is some hope that the stationary conductance @xmath222 can be quite close to the exact value even if the rg equations are truncated perturbatively in the effective vertices .",
    "although this truncation is not controlled in a strict mathematical sense since the effective vertices are still of order @xmath223 at @xmath173 and @xmath221 , one can check the reliability of the method by comparing the results in second and third order truncation . despite the fact that it can not be anticipated whether the result will converge by increasing the truncation order , a nearly identical result in second and third order gives some hint that an asymptotic series may be present leading to a very good result already in a low - order truncation . as we will see , this is indeed the case for the isotropic @xmath48-channel kondo model , where we can additionally check the quality of our results by comparing with the temperature dependence of the conductance at zero voltage obtained from numerically exact nrg calculations .",
    "close to the branching points @xmath216 , the situation is very different . here , the liouvillian is non - analytic and no finite - order truncation scheme will lead to a reliable result in the strong coupling case , where the vertices are of @xmath22 close to the branching point .",
    "this can indeed be checked for the kondo model at @xmath205 , where completely different results are obtained in second and third order truncation for the time evolution.@xcite the same holds for quantum - critical models , like the @xmath224-channel kondo model , where the branching point starts at @xmath173 , such that even stationary quantities can not be calculated by a perturbative truncation scheme . only for weak - coupling problems , where the effective vertices stay small close to the branching points ,",
    "a truncation in finite order is controlled . for such models ,",
    "the @xmath26-flow scheme is a useful method to resum systematically all powers of logarithmic terms @xmath225 in leading or sub - leading order to calculate the long - time behavior , where @xmath226 is some small dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "this has been demonstrated recently for the ohmic spin - boson model , @xcite , where different power - law exponents have been obtained for the time evolution compared to previous results . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is not possible within any other rg method at the moment .    as already noted in ref .",
    ", the values of the effective vertices close to the branching points can be of order @xmath22 even if they are small at the stationary point @xmath173 .",
    "this is the case , e.g. , for the @xmath48-channel kondo model at large bias voltages compared to the kondo temperature .",
    "thus , weak - coupling problems for stationary quantities can turn into strong - coupling ones concerning the long - time evolution .",
    "the physical reason is that the long - time dynamics is not cut off by any decay rate @xmath227 since the cutoff parameter of the rg flow determining that term of the time evolution associated with the branching point @xmath216 is given by the linear combination @xmath228 which tends to zero for @xmath229 .",
    "we will now derive the basic rg equations and for the effective liouvillian and the effective vertices .",
    "we start from the diagrammatic representation of the effective liouvillian in terms of the bare vertices as derived in ref .  .",
    "each diagram consists of a sequence of vertices connected by dot propagators denoted by the resolvents @xmath230 where we have already resummed all self - energy insertions to obtain the full effective dot propagator .",
    "the reservoir field operators of the vertices are connected by reservoir contractions @xmath231 as defined in eq .  .",
    "the diagrammatic series can be written as @xmath232 here , @xmath233 and @xmath234 are the bare liouvillian and the bare vertices as defined in eqs .   and .",
    "the resolvents @xmath235 with @xmath236 are determined by the set of indices @xmath237 which are associated with the reservoir lines crossing over the corresponding resolvent , where each index is taken from the vertex connected to this line and standing left to the resolvent .",
    "@xmath238 is the number of crossings of reservoir lines and @xmath239 is a symmetry factor arising if two vertices are connected by @xmath240 reservoir lines .",
    "@xmath241 denotes the product over all reservoir contractions , where the subindex @xmath242 means that only connected diagrams without any self - energy insertions are allowed . using eq .",
    ", we see that only pairs of indices @xmath243 can be connected by reservoir lines .",

    "implicitly we sum always over all indices and integrate over all frequencies @xmath246 .",
    "similar to the effective liouvillian , one can also set up a diagrammatic series for the effective vertex @xmath247 , which is defined by the sum of all connected diagrams with @xmath156 free reservoir lines with indices @xmath248 and keldysh indices @xmath249 . in the following",
    ", we will call these objects @xmath156-point vertices .",
    "since we consider here only bare vertices with @xmath250 , the effective vertices must have an even number of external lines .",

    "this minus sign accounts correctly for the minus sign from crossings of external lines if an effective vertex is used in a certain diagram instead of a bare vertex .",
    "\\(iii ) if the external lines are associated with different vertices , one has to sum over all permutations of the external lines .",
    "if two external lines are associated with the same vertex , only one sequence of the indices has to be considered .",
    "\\(iv ) the external vertices are normal - ordered , i.e. , if an effective vertex is used instead of a bare one in a certain diagram it is not allowed to connect the effective vertex with itself .",

    "if we want to exhibit the frequency dependence of the effective vertices explicitly we will also use the representation @xmath257 where on the right - hand side the indices @xmath258 do no longer contain the frequency variable .",
    "furthermore , when omitting the keldysh indices , we define by @xmath259 the @xmath156-point vertex averaged over the keldysh indices .",
    "once the effective vertices are defined , one can use them instead of bare ones in the diagrammatic series by resumming subclasses of connected diagrams . according to rule ( i ) , within a certain diagram the energy argument of",
    "the effective vertex has to be chosen identical to the one of the resolvent standing left to this vertex , i.e. , the combination @xmath260 will occur . if the first vertex from the left in a diagram is replaced by an effective one it has the energy argument @xmath26 .",
    "for example , replacing both vertices in eq .   by effective ones ,",
    "we obtain the expression @xmath261 however , we note that because of double - counting , it is not possible to replace all bare vertices by effective ones in the diagrammatic series and omitting certain diagrams .",
    "for example , when inserting eq .",
    "for the two two - point vertices into eq .  , we find a double counting of third order diagrams for the effective liouvillian .",
    "the same happens for the diagram of the two - point vertex when we replace the two bare vertices by effective ones . only for all @xmath156-point vertices with @xmath262",
    "a straightforward inspection shows that all diagrams can be resummed in a unique way such that only two - point vertices remain .",
    "furthermore , as will be explained below , after this resummation all internal frequency integrations are well - defined in the limit @xmath41 .",
    "this is the reason why we need a reformulation of the diagrammatic series in terms of the rg equations and only for the effective liouvillian and the two - point vertices .    using similar proofs as in ref .",
    ", one can show that the effective vertices have the following properties for fermions and @xmath156 even ( the case which we consider here ) @xmath263 where the @xmath264-transformation is defined in matrix notation by @xmath265 .",
    "in particular , @xmath266 guarantees the important property that the reduced density matrix @xmath94 given by eq .",
    "is hermitian , which is related to the hermiticity of the original hamiltonian.@xcite the property @xmath267 guarantees conservation of probability , @xmath268 .",
    "furthermore , we note that all @xmath156-point vertices are analytic functions in the upper half of the complex plane w.r.t . the fourier variable @xmath26 and the external frequencies @xmath246 .",
    "this follows from the fact that these variables occur only in the argument of the resolvents standing between the bare vertices in the form @xmath269 together with the property that the resolvent is an analytic function in the upper half of the complex plane .",
    "here we have assumed that the bare vertices are frequency independent . if an effective vertex is used instead of a bare one in a diagram it appears in the form ( after integrating out all @xmath270-functions between the internal frequencies of connected vertices ) @xmath271 where the indices @xmath272 and @xmath273 belong to the contractions which point to the left or to the right direction , respectively . using the diagrammatic series for eq .",

    "the convergence of the frequency integrals at high energies can easily be checked by counting the number of integrations and resolvents .",
    "for example , for the diagram of the effective liouvillian we have two frequency integrations and thus we need three resolvents for convergence . however , since there is only one resolvent present , we see that we need at least two derivatives w.r.t .",
    "@xmath26 to obtain a convergent integral . for the diagram of the two - point vertex",
    "we have one frequency integral , so we need two resolvents for convergence . since there is only one resolvent present , we need one derivative w.r.t .",
    "@xmath26 for convergence .",
    "this is the reason why we consider a perturbative expansion for @xmath176 and @xmath282 to perform the limit @xmath41 .",
    "using the diagrammatic representation , the @xmath26-derivative can only act on the resolvents @xmath283 occurring between the bare vertices .",
    "if a specific resolvent of a certain diagram is chosen for the derivative , one can classify the diagrams by the number of contractions running over this resolvent , i.e. , contractions which connect vertices standing left to the resolvent with vertices standing right to it . cutting all these contractions virtually , the diagram splits into two parts and one can subsequently resum all connected diagrams to the left and to the right of the resolvent .",
    "this resummation leads to effective vertices such that no contraction is left which connects effective vertices both standing either left or right to the resolvent . as a result",
    ", we obtain diagrams which contain only the effective vertices instead of bare ones .",
    "moreover , only diagrams are allowed where all internal contractions connect effective vertices which are on different sides of the resolvent where the derivative is taken .",

    "therefore , instead of writing complicated coupled rg equations for all higher - order effective vertices , it is more convenient to directly resum the diagrams for @xmath299 , such that only two - point vertices occur left and right to the resolvent where the derivative is taken .",
    "a straightforward inspection shows that this leads directly to the diagrams of eq .   in @xmath291 , and in all orders",

    "therefore , we will restrict ourselves to the rg equations and in the following .",
    "nevertheless , if desired , the systematic construction of the rg equations allows straightforwardly to go beyond third order truncation schemes .    since the limit",
    "@xmath41 has been performed , all internal frequency integrations for any diagram of the rg equations of the effective liouvillian or the two - point vertex can be replaced by the sum over the matsubara poles of the antisymmetric part of the fermi function , see eq .  . in particular",

    "this is very helpful for practical calculations and an important advantage over other nonequilibrium formalisms , such as the keldysh formalism , where the whole matrix structure in keldysh space has to be taken into account .",

    "we now consider temperatures and voltages much smaller than the kondo temperature and calculate numerical approximations for the coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which appear in the fermi liquid result  , using the differential conductance obtained in the second and third order truncation schemes .",

    "our result for the coefficient @xmath20 is the same as in ref .  ,",

    "temperature and voltage at @xmath205 , @xmath705 analogously , one can write the fermi liquid coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 , defined by eq .  , as @xmath706 as a consequence , the absolute values of the fermi liquid coefficients relate energy scales close to @xmath8 ( represented by @xmath13 or @xmath31 ) to energy scales very far below @xmath8 ( represented by @xmath707 or @xmath708 ) , i.e. they probe the correlation between different energy regimes .",
    "in contrast , the ratio of the fermi liquid coefficients @xmath709 probes only the energy regime very far below the kondo temperature , analog to the ratio @xmath672 , which probes only the energy regime close to @xmath8 .    since only the ratios of the various energy scales @xmath710 and @xmath708 are universal , conclusions about the reliability of the method are not unambigious when comparing the known results and @xmath711 to the results in second order truncation @xmath712 or to the ones in third order truncation @xmath713 the fact that @xmath714 is quite close to the correct result in second order truncation , whereas @xmath715 is very precise in third order truncation , might be an accident since the ratio of two energy scales can have a significantly different error than the energy scales themselves .",
    "overall we observe that all ratios depend significantly on the truncation order and , if the ratio of two energy scales from the same energy regime is taken , the result improves when increasing the truncation order .",

    "this is also in accordance with the fact that the result is in agreement with experiment and in agreement with another recent effective action method @xcite .",
    "moreover , as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : cond_finite_tv ] , our result for the ratio @xmath719 is very close to the result of ref .  .",
    "this provides evidence that our results in third order truncation are quite reliable for temperatures and voltages close to the kondo temperature .",

    "in contrast , the poor result for @xmath714 in third order truncation indicates that @xmath721 deviates significantly from the correct result , i.e. the temperature dependence is not so well described for @xmath722 .",
    "therefore , it seems that the rather precise result for @xmath714 in second order truncation is an accident and originates from the fact that both @xmath13 and @xmath707 are incorrect by approximately the same factor , whereas , in third order truncation , @xmath13 is more precise than @xmath707 , leading to the counterintuitive effect that the quality of @xmath714 decreases with increasing truncation order .    in summary ,",
    "we have presented arguments that the voltage dependence of the conductance seems to be quite reliable in third order truncation , whereas the temperature dependence needs to be improved in the regime @xmath722 .",
    "nevertheless , our arguments are partially based on speculations and need further substantiation by improved calculations for the nonequilibrium kondo model in the strong coupling regime .",
    "furthermore , we note that the third order rg scheme is in principle capable of reproducing the fermi liquid result @xmath723 exactly when an analytical solution of the rg equations is done for either @xmath560 and @xmath722 or @xmath5 and @xmath720 , and @xmath724 is expanded systematically in orders of @xmath1 , see ref .   for details .",

    "in this paper , we presented a real time renormalization group approach that extends the flow scheme introduced in ref .  , which uses the fourier variable as the flow parameter .",
    "we showed how universal rg equations can be set up in all orders and that only an expansion in the frequency - independent effective two - point vertex is needed to guarantee convergence of all frequency integrals .",
    "the rg equations can be solved in various truncation orders providing a consistency check for the reliability of the results .",
    "whereas in this paper the rg equations have been solved explicitly up to third order truncation for the kondo model , we have also outlined the procedure how to determine all terms in fourth order truncation .",
    "this might be helpful for future applications to test the reliability of the results even further .",
    "we have shown that universality can be achieved for the kondo model by using appropriate boundary conditions including the universal stationary conductance at zero temperature and zero bias voltage . with our procedure",
    "it is possible to arrive at stable results already for initial cutoffs which are about six orders of magnitude larger than the kondo temperature .",
    "this is a significant improvement compared to other methods trying to solve directly for the universal properties of the kondo model instead of the more involved anderson impurity model .",
    "we applied the method to the nonequilibrium spin-@xmath0 kondo model at zero magnetic field but arbitrary temperature and voltage .",
    "we found that the temperature - dependent conductance @xmath677 at fixed voltage @xmath79 exhibits non - monotonic behavior . the height and width of the appearing local peak were shown to scale linearly with the applied voltage over approximately six orders of magnitude in units of the kondo temperature .",
    "we compared our results to recent experiments and found good agreement in the regime where the kondo model is expected to describe the experimental system accurately .",
    "to characterize the temperature and voltage dependence of the conductance in different energy regimes close and far below the kondo temperature , we have defined four different energy scales @xmath13 , @xmath31 , @xmath707 , and @xmath708 .",
    "the scales @xmath707/@xmath708 are defined from the curvature of @xmath4/@xmath27 at @xmath5/@xmath560 , and the scales @xmath13/@xmath31 by the half width at half maximum of the peak of @xmath4/@xmath27 at @xmath5/@xmath560 .",
    "all these energy scales are proportional to the kondo temperature @xmath8 .",
    "we found that the shape of the conductance @xmath222 is independent of the truncation order when @xmath133 and @xmath79 are scaled in units of @xmath13 and @xmath31 , respectively , providing evidence for the reliability of our result for the temperature and voltage dependence of the conductance .",
    "however , an interesting issue is the determination of the three independent universal ratios of the four characteristic energy scales , which turn out to depend crucially on the truncation order .",
    "the ratio @xmath731 is known exactly from fermi liquid relations , relating the temperature and voltage dependence for @xmath664 .",

    "concerning future directions , the @xmath26-flow scheme offers a systematic method to avoid @xmath736 and logarithmic divergencies by resumming self - energy insertions and vertex corrections . since approximation schemes in different truncation orders can be defined , its reliability can be tested by itself , in particular in those regimes where the vertices start to grow .",
    "so far , applications were successful for @xmath224-level models where the dynamics of the local system is driven by spin fluctuations ( kondo model ) , energy fluctuations ( spin - boson model ) or charge fluctuations ( interacting resonant level model ) . in the future , it is of particular interest to understand the interplay between these fluctuations , as described , e.g. , by the anderson impurity model ( spin and charge fluctuations ) or by quantum dots coupled to a bosonic environment ( charge / spin and energy fluctuations ) . in particular , the anderson impurity model is expected to be a suitable model to extract the universal behavior in the kondo regime without resorting to the boundary condition of universal conductance , as used in this paper .",
    "this is motivated by recent nrg studies,@xcite where it was shown that universality is reached much faster for the anderson impurity model compared to the kondo model .",
