    "the threshold for zero pion mass occurs for @xmath74 with the value about 0.75 . the value of @xmath67 increases with @xmath74 , corresponding to a decreasing binding energy , which means that the intensity of the short - range interaction , that dominates the ground state , diminuishes .",

    "the vector meson mass is associated to the sum @xmath82 . in that sense ,",
    "the vector meson mass does not have the contribution of the strong attractive hyperfine interaction , and the coulomb effective attraction produces a binding energy too small compared to the mass , which we have desconsidered here . in figure 3 , the results of the difference of the squared masses @xmath83 of the ground state of the vector mesons and pseudo - scalar mesons as a function of the mass of the ground state of the pseudo - scalar mesons @xmath84 are shown .",

    "the linear raising behaviour of the difference @xmath83 with @xmath84 observed in figure 3 , is due to the saturation of the binding energy when @xmath86 .",
