    "it is widely believed that magnetism is a fundamental ingredient to explain the origin of high - temperature superconductivity in several materials .",
    "in fact , there is experimental evidence that the superconductivity in many heavy fermion ( hf ) compounds is mediated by spin fluctuations.@xcite mechanisms for superconductivity based on antiferromagnetism have been extensively discussed for the cu - based high - temperature superconductors as well.@xcite recently , considerable excitement has been generated by the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in the iron pnictides.@xcite except for the cuprates , the iron - based superconductors now have the highest superconducting ( sc ) critical temperature @xmath4 of any material ( see for example ref . ) . as in hf systems and cuprate superconductors , in the pnictides",
    "there is also evidence that the superconductivity is not mediated by the electron - phonon interaction.@xcite    magnetism and superconductivity can appear in different ways .",
    "in some hf compounds , superconductivity and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order co - exist,@xcite while for the cuprates the superconductivity emerges after the long - range afm order is destroyed by doping.@xcite in some hf systems , it is the superconductivity and ferromagnetism ( fm ) ( as opposed to afm order ) that co - exist.@xcite in this work , we will be interested in detecting a clear evidence of pairing of extra charges that are added to the undoped limit where magnetic order exists . using a two - orbital model and two - leg ladders",
    ", it will be shown that a possible region for the robust coexistence of ( spin triplet ) pairing together with magnetic order is where ferromagnetism develops .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with previous investigations carried out using one - dimensional systems.@xcite our effort should be considered simply as providing the first steps in relating pairing and magnetism in a complex two - orbital model via computational techniques on ladder geometries .",
    "antiferromagnetic order , as found in the pnictides , could also be favorable for pairing tendencies in the spin singlet channel , as discussed recently.@xcite    in principle , a theoretical investigation based on model hamiltonians for strongly correlated materials starts with an effective tight - binding model , containing the minimum ingredients to describe the physics of the materials under investigation . however , even if a well - defined reasonable model is used , it is still highly non - trivial to extract the ground state properties of these effective models in two or three dimensions using unbiased numerical methods .",
    "in fact , at present there are no accurate techniques to study hubbard - like models in dimensions two and three .",
    "thus , in order to get at least some insight on the ground states properties of theses models , it is common practice to study the model hamiltonians in quasi - one - dimensional geometries . in particular , a very popular route that has been used for several theoretical investigations is to study strongly correlated electronic systems using `` ladder '' geometries.@xcite the @xmath5-leg ladders consist of @xmath5 chains of length @xmath6 coupled by some parameter ( as , for example , fermionic hopping terms ) .",
    "the two - dimensional system can in principle be obtained by considering the limits of both @xmath5 and @xmath6 sent to infinity , although in practice this is difficult to do .",
    "this ladder - based procedure has been used to investigate models for the high temperature superconductors @xcite and for the hf systems .",
    "@xcite some important results were obtained with this method .",
    "for example , research based on microscopic models for the high @xmath7 superconductors,@xcite as well as research on hf models,@xcite indicate that superconductivity mediated by antiferromagnetic fluctuations can be stabilized , in agreement with several experiments .",
    "thus , the use of ladders appears to be an important ingredient to unveil dominant ground state tendencies .",
    "moreover , the hopping amplitudes that will be used in our investigations below include next - nearest - neighbor diagonal hoppings that are only possible when plaquettes exist in the lattice under consideration .",
    "note that microscopic models that may present superconductivity induced by antiferromagnetism , such as the one - orbital hubbard model and the kondo lattice model , have been extensively studied by several authors .",
    "however , microscopic models for _ superconductivity in a ferromagnetic spin background _ have been much less explored , with the exception of studies using one - dimensional chains.@xcite this may be caused in part by the perception that superconductivity and ferromagnetism , as opposed to antiferromagnetism , can not coexist.@xcite however , this perception has been challenged by the discovery of superconductivity and fm in the hf compounds uge@xmath8@xcite and urhge.@xcite moreover , sc and fm were also observed@xcite in the @xmath9-band metal zrzn@xmath8 .    motivated by the discovery of superconductivity in the hf compound uge@xmath8 , a few years ago karchev _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a one - band model to study the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism.@xcite however , other researchers have argued that the treatment used to investigate that model , as well as the model itself , were not appropriate to describe the coexistence of these phases.@xcite    due to the lack of studies of microscopic models for superconductivity mediated by ferromagnetic fluctuations beyond one - dimensional chains,@xcite in this work we have decided to investigate a microscopic ladder model where the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism appears possible . in fact , it will be shown below that the two - orbital model that has been originally proposed to describe the low - energy physics of the iron - based superconductors@xcite actually leads to the coexistence of pairing and spin ferromagnetic tendencies .",
    "qualitative our results are compatible with those reported using chains.@xcite although the model considered here may not be a proper effective model for superconducting ferromagnets such as uge@xmath8 , we believe that the mechanism that bounds together the charges carriers ( see section iii.b ) is so simple and generic that our calculations may also apply in a variety of other models as well .",
    "in these studies , we have considered the following hamiltonian defined on a two - leg ladder geometry @xmath10 where @xmath11 creates an electron with spin projection @xmath12 in the orbital @xmath13 ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively ) at the rung @xmath16 and leg @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the electron spin density operator , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the hopping amplitudes are : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , if @xmath25 , and zero otherwise . to avoid a proliferation of extra parameters in our analysis , we have decided to fix the values of these hoppings from considerations previously used in the pnictide context .",
    "our use of models originally devised for pnictides is simply based on the pragmatic observation that some pairing tendencies and ferromagnetic regions at large @xmath2 were already observed in those models.@xcite it should be clear though , that our research is mainly motivated by heavy fermion phenomenology .    following this strategy , then the hopping amplitudes @xmath26 @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29",

    "we have investigated the model defined above using a two - leg ladder of size 2@xmath42@xmath6 , by means of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique,@xcite under open boundary conditions ( obc ) , and keeping up to @xmath43=1400 states per block in the final dmrg sweep .",
    "we have carried out @xmath44 sweeps , and the discarded weight was typically @xmath45 at the final sweep . in our dmrg procedure ,",
    "the center blocks are composed of 16 states .",
    "we have used a fortran dmrg code to calculate most results , and a c++ dmrg code for additional validation.@xcite we have also confirmed some of our results against lanczos exact diagonalization techniques , when possible .    in this work",
    ", we will focus on the region of hubbard and hund parameters where @xmath46 , although a few results for positive values of @xmath47 will be presented as well . as shown below , in the region where @xmath48 there is a robust evidence of binding of holes / electrons close to density @xmath0 .",
    "in this regime @xmath3 .",
    "this inequality may not seem realistic at first sight , since the on - site spin triplet formation favored by @xmath2 ( hund s rules ) has its origin in the alleviation of the coulombic energy penalization caused by @xmath49 .",
    "however , while in the full five - orbital model for fe - based compounds @xmath3 is unphysical for the reason stated above , the two - orbital model is an _ effective _ model and it is unclear how the main parameters are affected by the projection from five to two orbitals .",

    "if tendencies toward the pairing of the extra charges are unveiled , they would be an indicator that this model could become superconducting in a two dimensional geometry , for the couplings here considered .",
    "let us start with the calculation of the binding energy of two doped holes / electrons .",

    "as it will be argued below , and as it was discussed in previous investigations for one - dimensional chains,@xcite in this regime the binding of hole / electrons is clearly present .    for completeness ,",
    "let us address this limit in detail , although it is clear that large @xmath2 compared with @xmath49 leads to an effective attractive interaction.@xcite let us denote the states of the one - site problem via the symbol @xmath85 , where the `` arrows '' @xmath86(@xmath87 represent the electrons ( with their spins projections ) at the orbital @xmath64(@xmath63 ) .",
    "for this one - site problem with two electrons and the limit considered here where @xmath2 is large , the ground state energy is degenerate .",
    "its value is @xmath88 , and the three corresponding eigenstates are @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and [ @xmath91 + @xmath92/@xmath93 . since @xmath94 , we can approximate the hamiltonian as @xmath95 , and the ( highly degenerate ) ground state energy of the two - leg model becomes @xmath96 .",
    "below , the dominant spin arrangement in the ground state at density @xmath0 is shown to guide the discussion @xmath97 using only the up and down projections of the spin one states at every site for simplicity .",
    "such a state is to be expected since for @xmath98 the alignment of the two spins at the two orbitals in the same site will occur , and as @xmath99 then having two electrons in the same orbital is not allowed .",
    "of course , any other configuration ( such as a fully ferromagnetic state ) is also equally likely as the one shown in the figure for @xmath94 .",
    "however , the hopping terms will lift the large degeneracy , and our numerical results for the spin - spin correlations presented before indicate that hopping terms favor the @xmath1 afm configuration , for a wide range of couplings in the undoped limit . for this reason , here",
    "we have chosen to present the dominant spin arrangement of the ground state as a stripe - like afm state , but it could be fully fm as well . regardless of this detail , the arguments we will use below to obtain the energies @xmath78 will hold true both for a stripe - like afm state , as well as for a fm state .",
    "let us now add two extra electrons to the undoped system . in the limit being considered here , where the hopping amplitudes are negligible , the best way for the system to minimize its energy is to have the two electrons located on the same site , since in this way less on - site ferromagnetic links are broken .",
    "the on - site hubbard @xmath38 energy penalization is the same whether the doubly occupied orbitals are at the same site or not , and since @xmath49 is negligible with respect to @xmath2 in the limit considered , then the ( effectively attractive ) hund coupling determines the location of the extra charge , leading to the double occupation of both orbitals at the same site.@xcite in this case , the dominant spin arrangement of the ground state is    @xmath100 once again , a stripe - like amf background is used , since for @xmath101 and close to the density @xmath0 our numerical data show ( see fig .  [ fig:4](a ) ) that the @xmath1 afm order is the dominant one , but it could have been fm as well . in the limit of couplings considered here ,",
    "the ground state energy for the doped two - electron system is @xmath102 note that if the two extra electrons that are in the state @xmath103 were to move in opposite directions ( after considering the presence of small but nonzero hopping terms ) they would break two ferromagnetic on - site links .",
    "such a state would have a large energy and it is therefore `` forbidden '' for @xmath94 .",
    "however , if the two extra electrons move `` together '' ( i.e. @xmath104 ) in the same direction , forming a spin triplet , then no other on - site fm links are broken .",
    "thus , to minimize the energy the two - electrons added to the system must form a bound state , at least in the limit where the hoppings amplitudes are very small compared with the hubbard and hund couplings ( the same spin dominant picture works when instead of adding electrons we remove two electrons , i.e. for the two - hole problem ) .",
    "this argument , known from previous investigations using chains,@xcite explains the binding of electrons in the limit @xmath94 .",
    "more explicitly , the binding energy of the doped two - electrons / holes system in the limit considered here is given by @xmath105    based on the discussion above we conclude that for @xmath94 , there is an indication of pairing , and perhaps superconductivity , in the two - orbital model .",
    "in fact , the on - site interorbital pairing state found here in this extreme regime results to be a spin triplet and transforms according to the irreducible representation @xmath106 of the group @xmath107.@xcite interestingly , exact diagonalization calculations in two - dimensional clusters , still in the fm state of the model but @xmath108 , found indications of a pairing state with the same characteristics and symmetry but with electrons at distance of one lattice spacing from each other.@xcite the argument presented above for this pairing is actually valid in any dimension , and also it works for the two doped holes case , as already mentioned . to confirm these argumentations ,",

    "<S> using the density matrix renormalization group and two - leg ladders , we investigate an electronic two - orbital hubbard model including plaquette diagonal hopping amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to search for regimes where charges added to the undoped state form pairs , presumably a precursor of a superconducting state . for the electronic density @xmath0 , i.e. the undoped limit , our investigations show a robust @xmath1 antiferromagnetic ground state , as in previous investigations . </S>",
    "<S> doping away from @xmath0 and for large values of the hund coupling @xmath2 , a ferromagnetic region is found to be stable . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , when the interorbital on - site hubbard repulsion is smaller than the hund coupling , i.e. for @xmath3 in the standard notation of multiorbital hubbard models , our results indicate the coexistence of pairing tendencies and ferromagnetism close to @xmath0 . these results are compatible with previous investigations using one dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> although further research is needed to clarify if the range of couplings used here is of relevance for real materials , such as superconducting heavy fermions or pnictides , our theoretical results address a possible mechanism for pairing that may be active in the presence of short - range ferromagnetic fluctuations . </S>"
