    "repulsive gravitational effects are an essential ingredient of the standard cosmological model ( scm ) , where they are evoked to overcome the difficulties faced by the friedmann model , such as the horizon , flatness , and origin of the primordial density fluctuations problems @xcite , as well as the observed late - time accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite . according to general relativity ( gr ) , when the minimal coupling principle is enforced , repulsive gravitational effects can only be generated by fluids with negative pressure .",
    "such fluids are invariably behind inflationary models ( see @xcite and references therein ) and dynamical dark energy models @xcite .    a series of attempts to overcome the cosmological singularity problem , arguably the most severe difficulty faced by the friedmann model ( see @xcite and references therein ) , were proposed in the past in which the alternative concept of repulsive gravitational effects generated by fields non - minimally coupled to gravity was introduced @xcite . in @xcite , in particular , a conformally coupled higgs - like field with a potential @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) was responsible for a reversal of the effective gravitational constant in the early universe , when the density reached a critical value @xmath2 .",
    "such model was later ruled - out on stability grounds , since as @xmath3 the effective gravitational constant diverges , @xmath4 @xcite . despite that",
    ", this idea paved the way for inflationary models based on non - minimally coupled higgs - like scalar fields @xcite ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and was the source of other gravitational repulsion models ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "as we shall see , that criticism does not apply here .    in the present work we revisit a model @xcite in which ordinary matter ( radiation )",
    "can generate repulsive gravitational effects by intervention of a conformally coupled scalar field .",
    "the main idea can be synthesized in the following steps :    * we assume the existence of a scalar field @xmath5 which has a quartic self interaction potential with the form @xmath6 ( we call attention to the relative sign ) ; * this scalar field couples non - minimally to gravity ; * we select among all possible candidates of such a coupling a conformal one ; * matter interacts with the scalar field only through gravity ; * the symmetry of the theory is broken by a state @xmath7 constant ; * when the field is in the broken symmetry state , the net result on the equation for the metric is to produce an effective gravitational constant which , under certain conditions , has the opposite sign of the bare newton s gravitational constant , provided that the energy - momentum tensor for the matter fields is traceless ( @xmath8 ) . * it will be shown that a necessary consequence of this process is that a ordinary radiation ( @xmath8 ) dominated universe exhibits a bounce .",
    "in what follows , we adopt the space - time metric with signature @xmath9 . the theory considered here",
    "is defined by a lagrangian with a scalar field non - minimally ( conformally ) coupled to gravity @xmath10 , \\label{lagrangian}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 are the components of the metric field , @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the ricci scalar , @xmath14 is the reduced gravitational constant ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 is the matter lagrangian density , and the self - interaction potential of the scalar field is given by @xcite @xmath17 we call attention for the fact that this potential differs from the usual ones employed in @xcite or in inflation models ( see @xcite ) by the relative sign between the mass term , @xmath18 , and the quartic self - interaction term , @xmath19 .",
    "the set of field equations obtained from the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) are    @xmath20 , \\label{grav_field_eq }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the energy - momentum tensor of the matter fields , and    @xmath26    is the  improved \" energy - momentum tensor of the scalar field . taking the trace of the field equation ( [ grav_field_eq ] ) , and using equation ( [ scalar_field_eq ] )",
    ", it follows that the ricci scalar can be expressed as follows @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "this enables us to rewrite equation ( [ scalar_field_eq ] ) in the form @xmath29      it is clear from equation ( [ grav_field_eq ] ) that in the case where the ground state of the scalar field potential vanishes , @xmath30 , the improved energy - momentum tensor of the scalar field @xmath31 is irremediably not conserved . following callan et al .",
    "@xcite , however , we can define the conserved energy - momentum tensor @xmath32 we now look for a constant solutions of equation ( [ scalar_field_eq_b ] ) which correspond to stable vacua of the scalar field .",
    "clearly , equation ( [ scalar_field_eq_b ] ) only admits a constant solution in the special case where the trace of the energy momentum - tensor of matter fields is a constant .",
    "we stress the fact that the symmetry breaking process is only possible in this case , otherwise no nontrivial ground state solution of equation ( [ scalar_field_eq_b ] ) exists .",
    "let us concentrate , from now on , on matter fields described by a traceless energy - momentum tensor , @xmath8 .    according to expressions ( [ em_complex])-([em_scalar ] ) , for a constant solution @xmath33 the energy density @xmath34 corresponding to the energy - momentum tensor ( [ em_complex ] ) has the form @xmath35 on the other hand , for @xmath36 equation ( [ scalar_field_eq_b ] ) admits , besides the trivial solution @xmath37 , two constant solutions @xmath38 the constant nontrivial solutions which minimizes the energy density functional ( [ energy_func ] ) , and satisfies relation ( [ relation ] ) , are given by @xmath39 the resulting behavior of the energy density @xmath40 exhibits three uncommunicating regions , two of them containing the stable local minima at @xmath41 , to which correspond @xmath42 , the other containing two unstable maxima and a metastable minimum at @xmath37 ( see fig [ energy_fig ] ) .",
    "consequently , when the energy - momentum tensor for the matter fields is traceless ( @xmath8 ) , and the field is in a non - trivial stable ground state ( [ const_sol ] ) , the gravitational field equation ( [ grav_field_eq ] ) assumes the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the renormalized gravitational constant .",
    "the term multiplying the energy - momentum tensor of matter ( ordinary radiation ) in equation ( [ grav_field_eq_2 ] ) can , thus , be viewed as a `` renormalized '' gravitational constant . clearly ,",
    "in the regime where the relation @xmath45 is satisfied ( _ i.e. _ either the mass @xmath46 of the scalar field has to be very small , or @xmath47 has to be very large ) , gravity is reversed , _ i.e. _ @xmath48 .",
    "we now investigate what cosmological solutions are compatible with the model discussed above .",
    "we assume spatial homogeneity and isotropy , and adopt a friedmann metric for the space - time @xmath49 , \\label{friedmann_metric}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the scale factor and @xmath51 determine the geometry of the spatial section . in order to be the source of the friedmann metric ( [ friedmann_metric ] ) the scalar field must depend on the cosmic time only ,",
    "@xmath52 . we consider a radiation - dominated universe , @xmath53 ( @xmath36 ) . in the regime",
    "@xmath54 the field equations reduce to    [ cosm_eq ] @xmath55",
    "@xmath56    where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the density and pressure of the radiation fluid . in this case , if condition ( [ condition_mass ] ) holds , gravity is reversed , @xmath59 , and the field equations ( [ cosm_eq ] ) only admit a solution for an open spatial section @xmath60 .",
    "form energy conservation we have @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a constant , so that the system of equations ( [ cosm_eq ] ) yield @xmath63 this equation can be readily integrated , and we obtain the following form for the scale factor @xmath64 therefore , the universe in this model exhibits a bounce around @xmath65 , the constant @xmath66 being the minimum value attainable by the scale factor .",
    "interestingly , the bouncing solution obtained above coincides with a model based on a non - minimally coupled vector field proposed by one of the authors @xcite , even though the two models differ considerably ( see appendix a ) .",
    "in the present work we revisited a model @xcite in which a scalar field conformally coupled to gravity can generate repulsive gravitational effects when only ordinary matter with traceless energy - momentum tensor ( radiation ) is coupled to gravity .",
    "it was shown that , in a radiation - dominated universe , when the scalar field is in a non - trivial ground ( broken symmetry ) state the only solution admissible by the field equations is a bouncing universe .",
    "we include here a short review of the bouncing cosmological model proposed in @xcite and the one presented above for an easy comparison between them .",
    "the lagrangian describing a vector field non - minimally coupled to gravity employed in @xcite is @xmath67 ,   \\label{lagrangian_d}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is a constant , and @xmath69 .",
    "the field equation are    [ field_eq_app ] @xmath70",
    "@xmath71    where @xmath72 is the improved energy - momentum tensor of the vector field .    in a friedmann geometry determined by the metric ( [ friedmann_metric ] ) , making the choice @xmath73 , and defining @xmath74 , the set of field equations ( [ field_eq_app ] ) assume the form    @xmath75    @xmath76    @xmath77    a particular solution for an open spatial section , @xmath60 , furnishes a scale factor with the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the minimum value of the scale factor .",
    "although this is the same solution ( [ scale_fac_bounce ] ) obtained for the scalar field , the two models differs in crucial points .",
    "first , the quantity @xmath80 , which is analogous to the effective gravitational constant of the model discussed in the main text , is not a constant but a function of the cosmic time ( although a model similar to the one considered in the main text would arise in the special case @xmath81 constant ) .",
    "second , here the non - minimally coupled vector field alone can be the source of the geometry , while in the bouncing model induced by the scalar field , in the absence of matter fields and for the scalar field in the non - trivial ( broken symmetry ) ground state , the gravitational field equations reduce to the vacuum einstein equations .",
