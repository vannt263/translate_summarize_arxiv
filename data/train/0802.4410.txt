    "the most noted power law in economics is perhaps the pareto law , first observed by vilfredo pareto @xcite more than a century ago .",
    "it was found that in an economy the higher end of the distribution of wealth @xmath1 follows a power - law @xmath2 and @xmath3 is an exponent ( now known as the pareto exponent ) which pareto estimated to be @xmath4 .",
    "for the last hundred years the changes in value @xmath5 3/2 in time and across the various capitalist economies seem to be small .",
    "this implies that there is inequality in the wealth distribution , and only a few persons hold the majority of wealth .    in 1931",
    ", gibrat @xcite suggested that while pareto s law is valid only for the high wealth range , the middle wealth range is given by the probability density @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a mean value and @xmath8 is the variance .",
    "the factor @xmath9 is also know an as the gibrat index , and a small gibrat index corresponds to a uneven wealth distribution .",
    "an unequal wealth distribution is associated not only to these functions , but also to any other one which is not of the form a dirac @xmath10-function .",
    "the problem of the appearance of inequalities seems therefore to be rather general and not necessarily related to a particular shape ",
    "e.g. the power - law form of the pareto law  of the wealth distribution , despite distributions can vary from case to case assuming qualitatively different shapes .",
    "in fact wealth distribution has always been a prime concern of economics .",
    "classical economists such as adam smith , thomas malthus and david ricardo were mainly concerned with factor wealth distribution , that is , the distribution of wealth between the main factors of production , land , labor and capital .",
    "modern economists have also addressed this issue , but have been more concerned with the distribution of wealth across individuals and households .",
    "important theoretical and policy concerns include the relationship between wealth inequality and economic growth .",
    "wealth inequality metrics or wealth distribution metrics are techniques used by economists to measure the distribution of wealth among the participants in a particular economy , such as that of a specific country or of the world in general .",
    "these techniques are typically categorized as either absolute measures or relative measures , and in the literature one of the most important debates is on the issue of measuring inequality .",
    "while one type deals with the objective sense of inequality , usually employing some statistical measure of relative variation of wealth , the other type deals with some indices that try to measure inequality in terms of some normative notion of social welfare for a given total of wealth .    _",
    "absolute criteria_. absolute measures define a minimum standard , and then calculate the number ( or percent ) of individuals below this threshold .",
    "these methods are most useful when determining the amount of poverty in a society .",
    "examples include the poverty line , which is a measure of the level of wealth necessary to subsist in a society .",
    "it varies from place to place and from time to time , depending on the cost of living and people s expectations .    _",
    "relative criteria_. relative measures compare the wealth of one individual ( or group ) with the wealth of another individual ( or group ) .",
    "these measures are most useful when analyzing the scope and distribution of wealth inequality .",
    "examples include the gini coefficient , which is a summary statistic used to quantify the extent of wealth inequality depicted in a particular lorenz curve .",
    "the gini coefficient is a number between 0 and 1 , where 0 corresponds with perfect equality ( where everyone has the same wealth ) and 1 corresponds with perfect inequality ( where one person has all the wealth , and everyone else has zero wealth ) .",
    "however , it has to be noted that `` wealth '' is here understood differently respect to its common meaning : it represents the total amount of goods and services that a person receives , and thus there is not necessarily money or cash involved .",
    "services like public health and education are also counted in , and often expenditure or consumption ( which is the same in an economic sense ) is used to measure wealth .",
    "thus , it is not clear how wealth should be defined .",
    "there is also the question that `` should the basic unit of measurement be households or individuals ? ''",
    "the gini value for households is always lower than for individuals because of wealth pooling and intra - family transfers .",
    "the metrics will be biased either upward or downward depending on which unit of measurement is used . these and many other criticisms need to be addressed for the proper use of inequality measures in a well - explained and consistent way .    in the attempt to answer some such basic questions and provide a foundation to the complex issues related to the appearance of wealth inequalities ,",
    "various authors have independently formulated minimal models of wealth exchange @xcite which , while being general enough to catch some universal features of economic exchanges , are simple enough to be simulated numerically in detail and studied analytically . in these models a set of agents @xmath11 ,",
    "representing individuals or companies whose state is defined by the respective wealth @xmath12 , interact with each other from time to time by exchanging ( a part of ) their wealths .",
    "such exchanges are defined by laws depending on the @xmath13 and also contain some random elements , as detailed below .",
    "a striking analogy was recognized  and actually motivated the introduction of some of these models  between the statistical mechanics of molecule collisions in a gas and these minimal models of economy , which are therefore referred to sometimes as _",
    "kinetic wealth - exchange models_. such an analogy , rather than for its peculiarity , should be noticed since it signals a possible universal statical mechanism in action in the dynamical evolution of systems composed by single units , from gas composed of molecules colliding with each other exchanging their energy to economic societies in which single units interact by exchanging wealth .",
    "this analogy is being analysed here in more details than done previously @xcite , and represents the goal of the investigations presented here .",
    "we begin by recalling the main features of kinetic wealth - exchange models in sec .",
    "[ features ] , concentrating on an example of model with a fixed _ saving propensity _ @xmath14 . in sec .",
    "[ variational ] it is shown how the fact that for a saving propensity @xmath15 one obtains an equilibrium @xmath0-distribution @xmath16 of order @xmath17 , instead of the boltzmann law @xmath18 obtained for @xmath19 , actually strengthens the kinetic analogy between economy systems and a gas in @xmath20 dimensions , with @xmath20 a known function of @xmath14 @xcite : through a general variational approach based on the boltzmann entropy it is shown that the @xmath0-distribution @xmath16 of order @xmath17 is the equilibrium canonical distribution of a system with a quadratic hamiltonian @xmath21 and @xmath22 degrees of freedom @xmath23 .",
    "the analogy is further discussed in sec .",
    "[ kinetic ] , this time through a complementary microscopic approach based on the analysis of the dynamics of particle collisions in an @xmath24-dimensional space . through mechanical considerations",
    "only based on momentum and energy conservation , it is shown that collision dynamics in @xmath24 dimension can be recast in the form of the evolution laws of kinetic wealth - exchange models , both for @xmath19 and in the case with saving propensity @xmath15 , corresponding to a number of effective dimensions @xmath25 .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ conclusion ] , conclusions are drawn .",
    "simple social models of wealth exchange have been shown to well reproduce many features of real wealth distribution .",
    "for instance , the exponential law @xmath26 observed at intermediate values of wealth is reproduced by a many - agent model system composed of @xmath27 agents , who are assumed to exchange wealth in pairs at each iteration , according to the wealth - conserving evolution equations  @xcite @xmath28 here @xmath29 is a uniform random number in @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the labels of two agents chosen randomly at each iteration , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent the corresponding wealths before and after a trade , respectively .    more general versions of this model assign a ( same ) saving propensity @xmath15 to all agents , which represents the minimum fraction of wealth saved during a trade  @xcite .",
    "as an example , in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite the evolution law is @xmath35 it is to be noticed that while the total wealth is still conserved during a trade , @xmath36 , only a fraction @xmath37 of the initial total wealth is reshuffled between the two agents during the trade .",
    "these models relax toward an equilibrium distribution well fitted by a @xmath0-distribution @xmath16 , as also noted by angle  @xcite , @xmath38 where the scaling parameter is @xmath39 and the parameter @xmath40 , as shown below , represents an effective dimension of the system and is explicitly given by  @xcite @xmath41 as the saving propensity @xmath14 varies in @xmath42 , the effective dimension @xmath20 continuously assumes the values in the interval @xmath43 .        a comparison between results of numerical simulation of wealth exchange models and the @xmath0-distribution is shown in fig",
    ".  [ realdata3 ] , together with some real data for uk . the the zero - saving propensity model of eqs .",
    "( [ sp1 ] ) is described by the exponential curve for @xmath19 .",
    "the main difference of the curves with @xmath15 respect to the exponential distribution is the appearance of a peak : while the average wealth is unchanged ( the system is closed and one still has @xmath44 , where @xmath27 is the total number of agents ) the number of agents with a a wealth close to the average value increase or , in other words , the wealth distribution becomes more fair for larger @xmath14 s and therefore larger values of the effective dimension @xmath24 .",
    "eventually , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath45 for @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) thus becoming a perfectly fair distribution . as a consequence , measures of the inequality of the wealth distribution , such as the gini coefficient ,",
    "decrease for increasing @xmath14 and tend to zero for @xmath46 . in the rest of the paper",
    "we discuss the statistical mechanical interpretation of the equilibrium @xmath0-distribution defined by eqs .",
    "( [ f - global ] ) and ( [ n ] ) .",
    "it may seem that in going from the exponential wealth distribution obtained for @xmath19 to the @xmath0-distribution corresponding to a @xmath15 the link between wealth - exchange models and kinetic theory has been lost .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0-distribution @xmath48 represents but the maxwell - boltzmann equilibrium kinetic energy distribution for a gas in @xmath24 dimensions , as shown in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "a more general derivation of the @xmath0-distribution @xmath48 is presented , in which it is shown , solely using a variational approach based on the boltzmann entropy , that @xmath48 is the most general canonical equilibrium distribution of an @xmath24-dimensional system with a hamiltonian quadratic in the coordinates .",
    "entropy - based variational approaches have been suggested ( e.g. by mimkes , refs .",
    "@xcite ) to be relevant in the description and understanding of economic processes .",
    "for instance , the exponential wealth distribution observed in real data and obtained theoretically in the framework of the dragulescu - yakovenko model discussed above , can also be derived through entropy considerations . considering a discrete set of @xmath27 economic subsystems which can be in one of @xmath49 possible different states labeled with @xmath50 and characterized by a wealth @xmath51",
    ", one can follow a line similar to the original boltzmann s argumentation for the states of a mechanical system  @xcite , by defining the total entropy as @xmath52 where @xmath53 represents the occupation number of the @xmath32-th state ; by variation of @xmath54 respect to the generic @xmath53 , with the constraints of conservation of the total number of systems @xmath55 and wealth @xmath56 , one obtains the canonical equilibrium distribution @xmath57 where @xmath58 defines the temperature of the economic system .    here",
    "we repeat the same argumentation for an ensemble of systems described by a continuous distribution @xmath1 , to show that this approach not only can reproduce the exponential distribution , but also the @xmath0-distribution obtained in the framework of wealth - exchange models with a saving parameter @xmath15 , a natural effective dimension @xmath59 being associated to systems with @xmath15 .",
    "the representative system is assumed to have @xmath24 degrees of freedom @xmath23 and a homogeneous quadratic hamiltonian , that for convenience is written in the rescaled form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the distance from the origin in the @xmath24-dimensional @xmath62-space . as a mechanical example",
    ", one can think of the @xmath24 momentum cartesian components @xmath63 and the corresponding kinetic energy function @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the particle mass ; or of the cartesian coordinates @xmath23 of an isotropic harmonic oscillator with elastic constant @xmath66 and potential energy @xmath67 . it can be checked  e.g. using the stirling approximation for the factorial function  that in the limit of large occupation numbers , the discrete version ( [ w ] ) of the boltzmann distribution becomes proportional to @xmath68 , where the continuous variable @xmath69 replaces the discrete label @xmath32 .",
