    "in our previous paper @xcite we introduced a cohomology over a symmetric finite tensor category @xmath1 and we constructed an infinite exact sequence a la villamayor - zelinsky which contains three types of cohomology groups .",
    "these three types of groups repeat periodically in the sequence and we consider the sequence so that in each level there are three groups of different types . in @xcite",
    "we interpreted the middle term in the second level of this sequence , obtaining the group of quasi @xmath1-coring categories .",
    "these results generate to the setting of symmetric finite tensor categories our results from @xcite , which were done in the context of commutative algebras over a commutative ring @xmath5 . in the author s ph.d .",
    "thesis @xcite and a paper which emerged out of it together with stefaan caenepeel we proceeded the former construction to commutative bialgebroids over @xmath5 .",
    "the idea of the present paper is to bring these constructions to the context of symmetric finite tensor categories and investigate how far we may get in this setting .",
    "we introduce bialgebroid categories over a finite tensor category @xmath1 . in @xcite",
    "we introduced @xmath1-comonoidal categories as coalgebra objects in the 2-category @xmath6 .",
    "we define a bialgebroid category @xmath3 as a @xmath1-bimodule category which is monoidal and @xmath1-comonoidal with certain compatibility conditions .",
    "intuitively , these conditions require that the commultiplication and the counit functors from the comonoidal structure are monoidal , though some caution is needed , as @xmath7 in general is not a monoidal category . to tackle this issue , we present two definitions , one for a non - braided and the other for a braided category @xmath3 , which obviously coincide in the braided setting .",
    "we concentrate on the case where both @xmath1 and @xmath3 are symmetric as monoidal categories .",
    "then we introduce a new cohomology over @xmath3 , called harrison cohomology , which for @xmath8 coincides with the amitsur cohomology over @xmath1 from @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a suitable functor from symmetric tensor categories to abelian groups ( or symmetric monoidal categories ) .",
    "thus @xmath11-cocycles over @xmath3 are @xmath12-cocycles over @xmath1 .",
    "we record that there exists an analogous infinite exact sequence as in the latter article , which is constructed following _ mutatis mutandis _ the ideas from therein . in order to interpret the middle cohomology group in the third level of this sequence , we consider quasi - monoidal structures on the bicategory of representations @xmath4 .",
    "these are tensor products on 0-cells with an associativity constraint which satisfies the pentagonal axiom up to a natural equivalence . in general these associativity constraints",
    "are not identities and this is why we deal indeed with a bicategory , rather than a 2-category @xmath4 .",
    "we call these structures `` quasi - monoidal '' as we are not interested at this point in the unit object , nor the corresponding unity constraints and other axioms for a monoidal bicategory structure on @xmath4 .",
    "we generate quasi - monoidal structures on @xmath4 using ( additive ) autoequivalences of @xmath13 . for this purpose",
    "we develope an eilenberg - watts - type theorem for 2-categories .",
    "we do this in two stages .",
    "firstly , in theorem  [ th : pre - ew ] we start with the ( 2-)category @xmath14 of pseudo - functors @xmath15 and construct a functor to the ( 2-)category @xmath16 .",
    "we show how the hexagonal coherence diagram for the monoidal structure of a pseudo - functor @xmath17 corresponds to the pentagonal axiom for the right @xmath1-module category structure of @xmath18 , while the pentagonal coherence for a pseudo - natural transformation @xmath19 of pseudo - functors @xmath20 corresponds to the pentagonal axiom for the right @xmath1-linearity of the functor @xmath21 .",
    "the functor @xmath22 induced in this way is cleary essentially surjective , though it is not full and fails to be an equivalence of categories . in theorem",
    "[ th : ew ] we restrict to the category @xmath23 of 2-functors which preserve arbitrary coproducts and cokernels and we prove that it is equivalent to @xmath16 . for a consequence , taking @xmath24 and considering invertible cells on both levels , we deduce that every autoequivalence of @xmath0 is equivalent to @xmath25 for some @xmath26\\in{\\operatorname{brpic}}({{\\mathcal c}})$ ] , where @xmath2 denotes the brauer - picard group introduced in @xcite .    finally , we prove that the quasi - monoidal structures on @xmath4 that we study form a monoidal category , whose grothendieck group is isomorphic to the group @xmath27 of 2-cocycles in our harrison cohomology with values in @xmath28 .",
    "for @xmath8 we get an interpretation of the 3-cocycles over @xmath1 . given a braided finite tensor category @xmath1 , we denote by @xmath29 the category of invertible one - sided @xmath1-bimodule categories .",
    "one - sided bimodule categories were studied in @xcite .",
    "the grothendieck group @xmath30 of @xmath29 is a subgroup of @xmath2 . in @xcite",
    "we proved that when @xmath1 is symmetric , the category @xmath31 is symmetric monoidal and thus the group @xmath30 is abelian .",
    "this fact underlies our construction of the amitsur cohomology over symmetric finite tensor categories in @xcite and the harrison cohomology over symmetric bialgebroid categories in the present paper . due to (",
    "* proposition 2.7 ) we know that any symmetric finite tensor category @xmath1 is equivalent to a category of finite - dimensional representations of a finite - dimensional triangular weak quasi - hopf algebra @xmath32 .",

    "we deduce a relation between the composition of successive morphisms acting between certain invertible objects in @xmath1 , on the one hand - side , and their tensor product , on the other .",
    "this will be of big importance in theorem  [ th : asoc - coc ] .",
    "section  [ se : ew ] is dedicated to the eilenberg - watts theorem for 2-categories , section  [ se : bialgebroids ] to the bialgebroid categories and section  [ se : harrison ] to our version of the hsrrison cohomology over symmetric bialgebroid categories @xmath3 . in the last section we study certain quasi - monoidal structures in @xmath4 . in theorem",

    "the obtained equivalence of categories finally yields the corresponding group isomorphism .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with the notions of a finite tensor category , a left / right / bimodule category over a finite tensor category , ( bi)module functors , deligne tensor product of finite abelian categories , tensor product of bimodule categories .",
