    "short of explicit temperature dependence in our phenomenological model , we consider two approaches : ( a ) we assume implicit temperature dependence of all symmetry allowed phenomenological parameters used in fitting the low temperature ( @xmath69k ) data ; ( b ) we assume the dominant effect of temperature is to introduce static damping due to thermal fluctuation .    assuming implicit @xmath80- dependence of fitting parameters",
    ", we fit the momentum dependent neutron scattering data taken at temperatures @xmath89k and @xmath91k . for the fits shown in fig .",

    "( 3 ) of text ) , we interpret the @xmath91k fit to be above the crossover temperature scale @xmath9 below which the structure factor shows a double peak . assuming @xmath131 , the system is then in a nematic phase with anisotropic structure factor at @xmath90k and above the crossover to the low temperature fluctuating stripe behaviour .",
    "consider the second approach to fitting mentioned above . since @xmath132 for the neutron energy transfer of @xmath81mev , sizable damping due to thermal fluctuation is expected at @xmath130k compared to @xmath69k .",
    "hence , we incorporate thermal fluctuation driven damping into the effective action through @xmath133 such that @xmath134 : @xmath24= \\frac{1}{g}\\int\\frac{d^2 \\mathbf{q } d\\omega}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\left(i\\gamma_0+i\\gamma |\\omega|+\\omega^2-\\delta^2\\left(\\mathbf{q}\\right)\\right )    % \\label{eq : action1}\\ ] ] it turns out both @xmath93k data and @xmath130k data can be fit by fixing all other parameters except overall intensity to their 5k values and setting @xmath135 mev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fitting2 ] ) .",
    "this signifies enhanced damping as the main difference between these data sets .",
    "both the experimental resolution and the phenomenological nature of our theory make it difficult for a multi parameter fit to be deterministic .",
    "however , the above demonstrates that our theory offers a sensible fit to the data for multiple line cuts in momentum space and the temperature dependence of the neutron scattering structure factor .",
    "in particular , these finite temperature fits demonstrate that @xmath9 in the range of @xmath136 and additional thermal fluctuation at @xmath130k compared to @xmath137 are consistent with the data .."

    "<S> as long as @xmath75 is small and the spin waves are gapped , so that we may use the quadratic action of eq . , the @xmath76 dependence of @xmath77 in eq . is valid to leading order in @xmath78 . by inserting @xmath74 to eq </S>",

    "<S> ( we also include symmetry allowed quartic terms of the form @xmath87 to fit high @xmath22 part of data @xcite . ) note that this momentum dependence fit at @xmath81mev is insensitive to the relative strength between damping and gap energy scales @xmath88 . only the frequency dependence is sensitive to this ratio . </S>",

    "<S> both figs.[fig : fit_momentum ] and [ fig : fit_frequency ] show good agreement with data . </S>",
    "<S> however given quite a few parameters , we should stress that fitting is more of a check rather than the main result of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the frequency dependence allows us to estimate @xmath95 giving a reasonable fit . note </S>",
    "<S> that while one expects the spinwave to be well defined inside superconductor due to lack of low - energy excitations to scatter off , the data of ref.@xcite appears to indicate significant amount of damping . </S>",
    "<S> speculating the source of this damping is beyond the scope of our paper but this might be consistent with existence of the low - energy excitations reported in superconducting underdoped @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ effect of other ordering tendencies _   for completeness </S>",
    "<S> , we also consider the effect of two other competing orders possibly proximate to the regime of our interest : the charge stripe(smectic ) and d - wave superconductivity </S>",
    "<S> .    for charge stripe ordering with wave vector @xmath96 the order parameter is @xmath97 where the spin index @xmath98 is summed over . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore find an additional contribution to the spinwave action @xmath99 from eq . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the existence of charge stripe shifts the spinwave gap by a constant ( @xmath100 term ) and it can also induce fluctuating and static spin stripe with incommensurability fixed by the charge stripe wave vector by @xmath101 ( @xmath102 term ) . however , incommensurability so induced will be @xmath80 independent since it is fixed by @xmath103 .    in the presence of @xmath104-wave pairing @xmath105 the leading additional contribution to the spinwave action </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath106 hence while @xmath104-wave superconductivity can also shifts the commensurate spinwave gap @xmath29 by a constant @xmath107 and enhance ( for @xmath108 ) or suppress ( for @xmath109 ) it can not lead to the observed @xmath80 dependent incommensurability either . these conclusions can be generalized to other pairing symmetries .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussions _   we have shown that the existence of charge nematic ordering can take a system proximate to afm and induce fluctuating spin stripe phenomena : incommensurate ins peaks . within a symmetry based phenomenological approach we explained the observed @xmath110 dependence of the incommensurability . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we established a concrete model connecting the spin and charge aspects of the electronic liquid crystalline behavior of . </S>",
    "<S> we further argued that this is a unique feature of charge nematic ordering .    </S>",
    "<S> one natural implication of our model is the possibility that _ outside _ but close to the charge nematic phase , impurities could stabilize fluctuating or even static spin stripes . </S>",
    "<S> since impurities break the crystal lattice symmetry , they naturally provide a symmetry breaking field which will induce a finite @xmath44 . in weak coupling , </S>",
    "<S> this would be given by @xmath111 where @xmath112 captures the orientational symmetry breaking of the impurities ( see ref . for a similar argument applied to charge stripes ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the response @xmath113 to this perturbation is expected to be large near a nematic phase , an @xmath44 larger than @xmath75 could be induced and fluctuating spin stripes will result . if it is further larger than @xmath64 , static spin stripes will be induced .    </S>",
    "<S> several future directions include , establishing a microscopic model which reproduces our phenomenological model in the long - wavelength limit and studying the effects of a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this latter question is particularly important in the context of observations of a magnetic field stabilizing static spin stripe phase@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since such a phase is accessible from our model , it will be interesting to include the effect of magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our analysis may provide a starting point for investigating the interplay between spin and electronic liquid crystalline ordering in other systems . by </S>",
