    "the characterization of the evolution of a quantum system is one of the main tasks to accomplish to achieve quantum information processing .",
    "a general class of methods , which have been developed in quantum information theory to accomplish this task is known as quantum process tomography ( qpt)- for a review of quantum tomography , see refs .",
    "[ @xmath0 .",
    "the various protocols of getting the complete information about the quantum process can be divided into two classes : the standard quantum process tomography ( sqpt ) [ 1,4,5 ] , with the central idea of preparing a set of linearly independent inputs and measuring the outputs via the quantum state tomography ( qst ) , works without requiring any additionally quantum resources .",
    "another is the so - called ancilla - assisted quantum process tomography ( aaqpt ) with the approach of encoding all information about the transformation into a single bipartite system - ancilla quantum state [ 6 - 8 ] .    as a known fact ,",
    "the complete characterization of a unknown quantum channel is a non - scalable task : for the @xmath1 @xmath2-level system , there are about @xmath3 elements to be decided .",
    "naturally , one may ask : can the number of experiment be scalable if partial information about the quantum process is to be characterized ? the average fidelity is an important quantity in qpt .",
    "it quantifies how well the quantum map preserves quantum information [ 9,10 ] .",
    "recently , it has been shown that it is possible to estimate the average fidelity via a technique known as twirling [ 9 - 15 ] .",
    "the haar - twirl channel can be produced by the so - called haar twirling procedure .",
    "it consists of applying a unitary , which is randomly chosen with the haar measure , before the process to be characterized , followed by the inverse of the same unitary .",
    "the average fidelity can be estimated by preparing an arbitrary pure state for the input of the haar - twirl channel and then measuring its survive probability ( the overlap between the input and output ) .",
    "another twirling procedure , where the unitary is sampled uniformly from the clifford group , has been proposed in [ 12 ] .",
    "the resulted clifford - twirl channel was shown to be equivalent with the haar - twirl one .",
    "still , the exact measurement of the average fidelity with the clifford twirling protocol , which involves finite but exponentially large resources , is a non - scalable task .",
    "however , to experimentally characterize the fidelity of a quantum process on @xmath4 qubits for a desired accuracy , an efficient protocol has been constructed with quantum circuits of size @xmath5 without requiring any ancilla qubits [ 12 ] .    besides the twirling protocol , another important ancilla - less way for deciding the average fidelity has also been developed .",
    "the average fidelity should be known if the survive probability of each state , which belongs to the state 2-design , has been decided [ 16 - 18 ] .",
    "furthermore , it was found that the state 2-design protocol can be also adapted to estimate an arbitrary element of the quantum process matrix .",
    "for the @xmath6-dimensional system , the state 2-design usually has more than @xmath7 elements in it .",
    "therefore , an efficient method to estimate a selected element , where the error scales as @xmath8 with @xmath9 the number for the repetitions of the experiment , has also been proposed in [ 16 - 18 ]",
    ".    the concept of the average fidelity can be generalized to the gate fidelity , a quantity characterizing how well the quantum map approximate a quantum gate [ 9 ] .",
    "it is demonstrated that twirling experiments previously used to characterize the average fidelity of quantum memories efficiently can be easily adapted to estimate the average fidelity of the experimental implementation of important quantum computation processes , such as untaries in the clifford group , in a practical and efficient manner[19 ] .    in present work",
    ", we shall develop a protocol to estimate the average fidelity of the quantum channel for a bipartite system .",
    "our work is motivated by such an interesting case : in the bell - type experiment , two spin-@xmath10 particles are initially prepared in an arbitrary state from a quantum source , then each particle is sent to alice and bob , the two users who are space separated , respectively . in general , we suppose that there exists a quantum map which relates the initial state ( for the two particles in the source ) to the final state ( for the two particles in the users hand ) .",
    "now , the average fidelity is still an important quantity to characterize the quantum process where the state should be kept unchanged .",
    "for such a case , the average fidelity is hard to be measured in a directly way : by its definition , one should measure the survive probability of an arbitrary state .",
    "however , the problem appears when the two particles are prepared in an entangled state . as a solution for it ,",
    "we introduce three directly measurable quantities , the average survive probability of the product state and the average survive probability of each subsystem , for the bipartite system and give a formula to estimate the average fidelity with the introduced quantities .",
    "furthermore , we show that our protocol can be also applied to decide an arbitrary selected element of the quantum process matrix .",
    "the rest content of present work can be divided into following parts . in sec .",
    "ii we shall give a brief review of the known ancilla - less methods used to estimate the average fidelity of the quantum channel .",
    "especially , we introduce the convenient tool where a bounded matrix is related to a vector in the enlarged hilbert space . as an application of it",
    ", we show that the average fidelity can be calculated as the expectation of the quantum process super operator with the separable werner state",
    ". in section iii we shall firstly define the three quantities , the average survive probability of the product state and the average survive probability of each subsystem , for the bipartite system and then design several protocols to measure them .",
    "a formula , where the average fidelity is related to the three average survive probabilities , should be constructed there . in sec .",

    "several ways of measuring these quantities are depicted in fig .",

    "a solution for this problem is to find an efficient approximated way where the error introduced by the approximation should depend on the number of operations irrespective of the dimension of the joint system .    in this section",
    ", we shall develop such an efficient way to measure of the average survive probabilities . in what follows",
    "we restrict ourself to the case where a set of product states , @xmath268 should be prepared as the inputs of the quantum channel @xmath97 while the average survive probabilities defined in ( 19 - 21 ) are approximated with the way like @xmath269,\\nonumber\\\\ \\bar{f}^{\\mathrm{appr}}_{a}=\\frac{1}{m^2}\\sum_{i , j,=1}^m\\mathrm{tr}[(\\psi_i\\otimes \\mathrm{i}_{d})\\lambda(\\psi_i\\otimes \\psi_j)],\\nonumber\\\\ \\bar{f}^{\\mathrm{appr}}_{b}=\\frac{1}{m^2}\\sum_{i , j,=1}^m\\mathrm{tr}[(\\mathrm{i}_d\\otimes \\psi_j)\\lambda(\\psi_i\\otimes \\psi_j)].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these average quantities can be also measured with the twirling procedures by letting @xmath270 with @xmath39 and @xmath271 to be a fixed state and the arbitrary unitary transformations in @xmath64 , respectively . by following the steps for getting the super operators in ( 33 - 35 ) , the above equations can be also expressed @xmath272 , ~~\\alpha = a , b , ab.\\ ] ] in which the super operators @xmath273 are defined as @xmath274    in above sections , we have shown that the average fidelity can expressed as the expectation of the super operator @xmath132 , which is defined in ( 31 ) , with the separable werner state @xmath208 , @xmath275 $ ] . with the expanding formula of the identity operation in ( 37 ) , one may rewrite @xmath208 as @xmath276 in which the operator @xmath124 is defined as @xmath277 now , the average fidelity is approximated in the way like @xmath278\\ ] ] with @xmath279 the approximated separable werner state , @xmath280    considering the fact that the super operator @xmath132 , which is decided by the quantum map @xmath97 , is usually unknown , for simplicity , we suppose that the accuracy of the approximation should depend on the difference between the separable werner state and its approximated form . as it has been done in [ 25 ] , we introduce the hilbert - schmidt norm of their difference , @xmath281,\\ ] ] to characterize how well the separable werner state is approximated . with the definitions from ( 62 ) to ( 64 ) , we simplify the above equation into the form @xmath282    in order to perform the above calculation in an easy way , we shall introduce the operators @xmath283 , @xmath284 and reexpress the operator @xmath285 in ( 65 ) with a more compact form @xmath286 with above formula , one may easily verify that @xmath287=\\mathrm{tr}[\\delta ( \\delta)^{\\dagger}_{\\mathrm{appr}}]=\\mathrm{tr}[\\delta_{\\mathrm{appr } } ( \\delta)^{\\dagger}]=\\frac{2(d^2 - 1)}{d^2}.\\ ] ] therefore , the hilbert - schmidt norm is @xmath288 where the quantity @xmath289 should be decided by our actual choice of the states @xmath290 .",

    "therefore , we conclude that the separable werner state is approximated in an efficient way : the upper bound of the error introduced by the approximation process scales better than @xmath297 with the number of repetitions @xmath298 of the experiment .",
    "in previous works , the state 2-design has also been defined in the way like : @xmath299=\\frac{\\mathrm{tr}[a]\\mathrm{tr}[b]+\\mathrm{tr}[ab]}{d(d+1)}.\\ ] ] one may check that the definition in ( 4 ) is consisted with it . applying the isomorphism introduced in ( 9 ) , we rewrite the left side of the above equation as @xmath299   = \\mathrm{tr}[(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{x=1}^{n } \\psi_x \\otimes \\psi_x^*)(a\\otimes b^{\\mathrm{t}})].\\ ] ] as it has been shown in section ii , from the definition of the state 2-design in ( 4 ) , we can get an extremely simple relation between the state 2-design and the separable werner state , @xmath300 with the results , @xmath301=\\mathrm{tr}[b^{\\mathrm{t}}]$ ] and @xmath302 $ ] , we have @xmath303=\\frac{\\mathrm{tr}[a]\\mathrm{tr}[b]+\\mathrm{tr}[ab]}{d(d+1)}.\\ ] ] from it , one may conclude that the definition in ( 4 ) is consisted with the one in ( 73 ) .",
    "finally , let s end our work with a short conclusion .",
    "for the bipartite system , we have introduced three directly measurable quantities , the average survive probability of the product states and the survive probability for each subsystem , and developed several protocols to measure them .",
    "these average quantities can be applied to estimate the average fidelity of the quantum channel and the selected element of the quantum process matrix .",
    "_ appendix .",
    "_ in section ii , we have introduced a super operator @xmath159 , @xmath304 , and stated that it should equal with the separable werner state defined in ( 17 ) .",
