    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has already delivered an integrated luminosity of more than 5  fb@xmath7 per experiment during its 7 tev run , and another 20  fb@xmath7 at 8 tev , and is well on its way to testing the standard model ( sm ) in detail .",

    "these measurements are used to constrain physics beyond the sm by parametrizing the @xmath12 and @xmath13 vertices with anomalous couplings @xcite and placing limits on the values of these couplings . although the anomalous coupling parametrization is completely general , it is a common practice to consider only the subset of couplings that conserve charge conjugation and parity ( and thus cp ) . in this paper",
    "we revisit the study of the subset of these couplings that violate cp along the lines of our previous analysis for the tevatron @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for this study is that our understanding of cp violation remains incomplete and constraining the cp violating anomalous couplings from the experimental perspective it is a simple extension of existing studies .    from measurements of the cross - section alone",
    "it is not possible to distinguish between the effects of the cp conserving or cp violating anomalous couplings , although we will show that the @xmath1 cross section is quite sensitive to cp violating couplings . in order to separate the two",
