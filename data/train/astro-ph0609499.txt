    "understanding how local galaxies of different hubble types we observe to - day have formed is one of the most challenging open problems in cosmology . among the different galaxy families ,",
    "elliptical ( es ) are the easiest to study and those that show the most precise regularities in their empirical properties , some times in the form of tight correlations among their observable parameters .",
    "the interest of these regularities lies in that they could encode a lot of relevant informations on the physical processes underlying e formation and evolution .    the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "2000 ) has substantially improved the statistics on e samples . the sample selected by bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , using morphological and spectral criteria , contains 9000 es to date in the redshift range @xmath5 and in every environment from voids to groups to rich clusters .",
    "analyses of their structural and dynamical parameters have shown that the distributions of their luminosities @xmath6 , radii at half projected light @xmath7 , and central line - of - sight velocity dispersions @xmath8 ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003b , 2003c ) , are approximately gaussian at any @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , a maximum likelihood analysis indicates that the pairs of parameters @xmath8@xmath6 and @xmath7@xmath6 , or their combinations , such as the mass - to - luminosity ratio within the effective radii @xmath10 and @xmath6 ( where @xmath11 is the dynamical mass defined as @xmath12 ) , show correlations consistent with those previously established in literature , obtained from individual galaxy spectra of smaller samples , such as the faber - jackson relation ( 1976 ) ; the @xmath13@xmath8 relation ( dressler et al . 1987 ) ; and the surface brightness @xmath14 relation ( kormendy 1977 , kormendy & djorjovski 1989 ) , among others .",
    "furthermore , early - type galaxies in the sdss have been found to have roughly constant stellar - mass - to - light ratios ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003a , 2003b ; padmanabhan et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the correlations involving two variables out of the three needed to fully characterise the structure and dynamics of an e galaxy , are projections of the so - called fundamental plane relation ( fp , djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al . 1987a ; faber et al .",
    "1987 ; kormendy & djorgovski 1989 ) , involving the three or some or their combinations .",
    "the fp relation can be written as    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the mean surface brightness within @xmath7 .",
    "the values of the fp coefficients for the sdss e sample are @xmath17 , similar in the four sdss bands , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ( see their exact values in bernardi et al .",
    "2003c , table 2 ) with a small scatter .",
    "these sdss results confirm previous ones , either in the optical ( lucey , bower & ellis 1991 ; de carvalho & djorgovski 1992 ; bender , burstein & faber 1992 ; jrgensen et al .",
    "1993 ; prugniel & simien 1996 ; jrgensen et al .",
    "1996 ) or in the near - ir wavelengths ( recillas - cruz et al . 1990 , 1991 ; pahre , djorgovski & de carvalho 1995 ; mobasher et al .",
    "1999 ) , even if the published values of @xmath20 show larger values in the @xmath21-band than at shorter wavelengths ( see , for example , pahre , de carvalho & djorgovski 1998 ) .",
    "the existence of the fp and its small scatter has the important implication that it provides us with a strong constraint when studying elliptical galaxy formation and evolution ( bender , burstein & faber 1993 ; guzmn , lucey & bower 1993 ; renzini & ciotti 1993 ) .",
    "the physical origin of the fp is not yet clear , but it must be a consequence of the physical processes responsible for galaxy assembly . these processes built up early type galaxies as dynamically hot systems whose configuration in phase space are close to equilibrium . taking an elliptical galaxy as a system in equilibrium , the virial theorem    @xmath22    where @xmath2 is its virial mass , @xmath23 is the average 3-dimensional velocity dispersion of the whole elliptical , including both dark and baryonic matter , @xmath24 the dynamical half - radius or radius enclosing half the total mass of the system , and @xmath25 a form factor of order unity , would imply a relation similar to eq .",
    "[ fp ] with @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( known as the virial plane , faber et al .",
    "1987 ) , should the dynamical mass - to - light ratios , @xmath28 , and the mass structure coefficients    @xmath29    be independent of the e luminosity or mass scale .",
    "the observational results described above mean that the fp is _ tilted _ relative to the virial plane , and , consequently that either @xmath28 or @xmath30 , or both , do depend on the e luminosity .",
    "different authors interpret the tilt of the fp relative to the virial relation as caused by different misassumptions that we comment briefly ( note that we can write @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the stellar mass of the elliptical galaxy ) .",
    "1.1 ) a first possibility is that the tilt is due to systematic changes of stellar age and metallicity with galaxy mass , or , even , to changes of the slope of the stellar initial mass function ( hereafter , imf ) with galaxy mass , resulting in systematic changes in the _ stellar_-mass - to - light ratios , @xmath33 , with mass or luminosity ( zepf & silk 1996 ; pahre at al .",
    "1998 ; mobasher et al .",
    "1999 ) . but",
    "these effects could explain at most only @xmath34 one third of the @xmath35 value in the @xmath36-band ( tinsley 1978 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ; prugniel & simien 1996 ; see also renzini & ciotti 1993 ; trujillo , burkert & bell 2004 ) .",
    "furthermore , early - type galaxies in the sdss have been found to have roughly constant stellar - mass - to - light ratios ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003a , 2003b ) .",
    "anyhow , the presence of a tilt in the @xmath21-band fp , where population effects are no important , indicates that it is very difficult that the tilt is caused by stellar physics processes alone , as bender et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , renzini & ciotti ( 1993 ) , guzmn et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , pahre et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , among other authors , have suggested .",
    "a second possibility is that @xmath28 changes systematically with the mass scale because the total dark - to - visible mass ratio , @xmath37 changes ( see , for example , renzini & ciotti 1993 ; pahre et al . 1998 ; ciotti , lanzoni & renzini 1996 ; padmanabhan et al . 2004 ) .",
    "otherwise , a dependence of @xmath30 on the mass scale could be caused by systematic differences in :    2.1 ) the dark versus bright matter spatial distribution ,    2.2 ) the kinematical segregation , the rotational support and/or velocity dispersion anisotropy in the stellar component ( dynamical non - homology ) ,    2.3 ) systematic projection or other geometrical effects .",
    "taking into account these effects in the fp tilt demands modelling the galaxy mass and velocity three - dimensional distributions and comparing the outputs with high quality data .",
    "bender et al .",
    "( 1992 ) considered effects iii ) and iv ) ; ciotti et al .",
    "( 1996 ) explore ii ) - iv ) and conclude that an systematic increase in the dark matter content with mass , or differences in its distribution , as well as a dependence of the srsic ( 1968 ) shape parameter for the luminosity profiles with mass , may by themselves formally produce the tilt ; padmanabhan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find evidence of effect ii ) in sdss data .",
    "other authors have also shown that allowing for broken homology , either dynamical ( busarello et al . 1997 ) , in the luminosity profiles ( trujillo et al .",
    "2004 ) , or both ( prugniel & simien 1997 ; graham & colless 1997 ; pahre et al .",
    "1998 ) , brings the observed fp closer to eq .",
    "observational methods suffer from some drawbacks to study in deph the physical origin of the fp tilt .",
    "for example , a drawback is the impossibility to get accurate measurements of the elliptical three - dimensional mass distributions ( either dark , stellar or gaseous ) and another is that the intrinsic 3d velocity distribution of galaxies is severely limited by projection .",
    "only the line - of - sight velocity distributions can be inferred from galaxy spectra . and , so , the interpretation of observational data is not always straightforward . to complement the informations provided by data and circumvent these drawbacks , analytical modelling",
    "is largely used in literature ( kronawitter et al . 2000 ; gerhard et al . 2001 ; romanowsky & kochanek 2001 ; borriello et al . 2003 ; padmanabhan et al .",
    "2004 ; mamon & lockas 2005a , 2005b ) .",
    "these methods give very interesting insights into mass and velocity distributions , as well as the physical processes causing them , but are somewhat limited by symmetry considerations and other necessary simplifying hypotheses .",
    "these difficulties and limitations could be circumvented should we have at our disposal complete informations on the phase - space of the galaxy constituents .",
    "this is not possible through observations , but can be attained , at least in a virtual sense , through numerical simulations .",
    "capelato , de carvalho & carlberg ( 1995 ) first addressed the origin of the fp through numerical simulations . by analyzing the remnants of the dissipationless mergers of two equal - mass one - component king models , and varying their relative orbital energy and angular momentum ,",
    "they show that the mergers of objects in the fp produces a new objects in the fp .",
    "this result was extended by dantas et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who used one- and two - component hernquist models as progenitors , gozlez - garca & van albada ( 2003 ) , based on jaffe ( 1983 ) models and by boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who used hernquist+nfw models .",
    "nipoti , londrillo & ciotti ( 2003 ) show , in turn , that the fp is well reproduced by dissipationless hierarchical equal - mass merging of one- and two - component galaxy models , and by accretion with substantial angular momentum , with the merging zeroth - order generation placed at the fp itself . they also found that both the faber - jackson and the kormendy relations are not reproduced by the simulations , and conclude that dissipation must be a basic ingredient in elliptical formation . in agreement with this conclusion ,",
    "dantas et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and dantas et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have shown that the end products of dissipationless collapse generally do not follow a fp - like correlation .",
    "bekki ( 1998 ) first considered the role of dissipation in elliptical formation through pre - prepared simulations .",
    "he adopts the merger hypothesis ( i.e .. , ellipticals form by the mergers of two equal - mass gas - rich spirals ) and he focuses on the role of the timescale for star formation in determining the structural and kinematical properties of the merger remnants .",
    "he concludes that the slope of the fp reflects the difference in the amount of dissipation the merger end products have experienced according with their luminosity ( or mass ) .",
    "recently , robertson et al . (",
    "2006 ) have confirmed this conclusion on the role of dissipative dynamics to shape the fp , again through pre - prepared mergers of disk galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we go a step further and we analyse the tilt of the fp in samples of virtual ellipticals formed in a cosmological context through self - consistent hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "this numerical approach provide a convenient method to work out the clues of regularity and systematics of elliptical galaxies , and to find out their links with the processes involved in galaxy assembly in a cosmological context .",
    "the point important for our present purposes is that they _",
    "directly _ provide with complete 6-dimensional phase - space informations on each constituent particle sampling a given galaxy - like object formed in the simulation , that is , they give directly the mass and velocity distributions of dark matter , gas and stars of each object .",
    "taking advantage of these possibilities , we have analysed ten self - consistent hydrodynamical simulations run in the framework of a flat @xmath38cdm cosmological model , characterised by cosmological parameters consistent with their last determinations ( spergel et al .",
    "galaxy - like objects of different morphologies form in these simulations at @xmath0 : irregulars , disc - like objects , s0-like objects and elliptical - like objects ( hereafter , elos ) .",
    "elos have been identified as those objects having a prominent dynamically relaxed , roughly non - rotating stellar spheroidal component , with no extended disks and very low cold gas content ; the stellar component has typical sizes of no more than @xmath1 10 - 40 kpc , it dominates the mass density at these scales ( hereafter , _ elo or baryonic object scale _ ) and it is embedded in a halo of dark matter typically ten times larger in size ( hereafter , _ halo scale _ ) . in a forthcoming paper ( oorbe et al .",
    ", in preparation ) we report on an analysis of the mass and velocity distributions of the different elo components : dark matter , stars , cold gas and hot gas . in this paper",
    "we focus on the quantitative characterisation of these mass and velocity distributions through their corresponding parameters , both at the elo and at the halo scales . at the baryonic object scale , to characterise the structural and dynamical properties of elos , we will describe their three dimensional distributions of mass and velocity through the three intrinsic ( that is , three - dimensional ) parameters ( the stellar mass at the baryonic object scale , @xmath39 , the stellar half - mass radii at the baryonic object scale , @xmath40 , defined as those radii enclosing half the @xmath39 mass , and the mean square velocity for stars , @xmath41 ) whose observational projected counterparts ( the luminosity @xmath6 , effective projected size @xmath7 , and the stellar central l.o.s .",
    "velocity dispersion , @xmath8 ) enter the definition of the observed fp ( eq . [ fp ] ) . to help the reader , in table  [ tabnombres ] we give a list of the parameter names and symbols and in table  [ tabnombres2 ] a list of the profiles and ratios .",
    "these intrinsic parameters have been measured on elos , and their correlations have been looked for , and more specifically , the lower  dimensional regions ( i.e. , _ dynamical planes _ ) they fill in the three dimensional space of the @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 parameters , because the observational manifestation of these dynamical planes is the fp relation . these informations , combined with that on the mass , size and velocity dispersion parameters at the halo scale , allows us to test whether or not the @xmath30 coefficients and the @xmath37 ratios do systematically depend on the mass scale , so that the tilt and the scatter of the observed fp can be explained in terms of the regularities in the structural and dynamical properties of elos formed in self - consistent hydrodynamical simulations .    fully - consistent gravo - hydrodynamical simulations as a method to study e assembly has already proven to be useful .",
    "an analysis of elo structural and kinematical properties that can be constrained from observations ( i.e. , stellar masses , projected half - mass radii , central line - of - sight velocity dispersions ) , has shown that they have counterparts in the local universe as far as these properties are concerned ( siz 2003 ; siz , domnguez - tenreiro & serna 2004 , hereafter sdts04 ) , including the fp relation and some clues about its physical origin ( oorbe et al . 2005 ) , and its lack of dynamical evolution ( domnguez - tenreiro et al .",
    "2006 , hereafter dtal06 ) .",
    "also , elo stellar populations have age distributions showing similar trends as those inferred from observations ( domnguez - tenreiro , siz & serna 2004 , hereafter dss04 ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in @xmath422 we briefly describe the simulations , the elo samples and their generic properties .",
    "the elo size and mass scales and their relations are analysed in @xmath423 .",
    "@xmath424 is devoted to kinematics and in @xmath425 we report on the intrinsic dynamical plane of elos and its comparison with the observed fundamental plane , and we analyse its physical origin .",
    "finally , in @xmath426 we summarise our results and discuss them in the context of theoretical results on halo structure and dissipation of the gaseous component .",
    "we have analysed elos identified in ten self - consistent cosmological simulations run in the framework of the same global flat @xmath38cdm cosmological model , with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the normalisation parameter has been taken slightly high , @xmath46 , as compared with the average fluctuations of 2dfgrs or sdss galaxies ( lahav et al .",
    "2002 , tegmark et al . 2004 ) or recent results from wmap ( spergel et al .",
    "2006 ) to mimic an active region of the universe ( evrard , silk & szalay 1990 ) .",
    "we have used a lagrangian code , ( deva , serna , domnguez - tenreiro & siz , 2003 ) , particularly designed to study galaxy assembly in a cosmological context .",
    "gravity is computed through an ap3m - like method , based on couchman ( 1991 ) .",
    "hydrodynamics is computed through a sph technique where special attention has been paid to make the implementation of conservation laws ( energy , entropy and angular momentum ) as accurate as possible ( see serna et al .",
    "2003 for details , in particular for a discussion on the observational implications of violating some conservation laws ) .",
    "entropy conservation is assured by taking into consideration the space variation of the smoothing length ( i.e. , the so - called @xmath47 terms ) .",
    "time steps are individual for particles ( to save cpu time , allowing a good time resolution ) , as well as masses .",
    "time integration uses a pec scheme . in any run , an homogeneously sampled periodic box of 10  mpc side has been employed and 64@xmath48 dark matter and 64@xmath48 gas particles , with a mass of @xmath49 and @xmath50m@xmath51 , respectively , have been used .",
    "the gravitational softening used was @xmath52 kpc .",
    "the cooling function is that from tucker ( 1975 ) and bond et al .",
    "( 1984 ) for an optically thin primordial mixture of h and he ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) in collisional equilibrium and in absence of any significant background radiation field with a primordial gas composition . each of the ten simulations started at a redshift @xmath55 .",
    "star formation ( sf ) processes have been included through a simple phenomenological parametrisation , as that first used by katz ( 1992 , see also tissera et al .",
    "1997 ; siz 2003 and serna et al .",
    "2003 for details ) that transforms cold locally - collapsing gas at the scales the code resolves , denser than a threshold density , @xmath56 , into stars at a rate @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a characteristic time - scale chosen to be equal to the maximum of the local gas - dynamical time , @xmath59 , and the local cooling time ; @xmath60 is the average star formation efficiency at resolution @xmath61 scales , i.e. , the empirical kennicutt - schmidt law ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that , in the context of the new sequential multi - scale sf scenarios ( vzquez - semadeni 2004a , 2004b ; ballesteros - paredes et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) , it has been argued that this law , and particularly so the low @xmath60 values inferred from observations , can be explained as a result of sf processes acting on dense molecular cloud core scales when conveniently averaged on disc scales ( elmegreen 2002 ; sarson et al .",
    "2004 , see below ) .",
    "supernova feedback effects or energy inputs other than gravitational have not been _ explicitly _ included in these simulations .",
    "we note that the role of discrete stellar energy sources at the scales resolved in this work is not yet clear , as some authors argue that stellar energy releases drive the structuring of the gas density locally at sub - kpc scales ( elmegreen 2002 ) .",
    "in fact , some mhd simulations of self - regulating snii heating in the ism at scales @xmath62 250 pc ( sarson et al .",
    "2004 ) , indicate that this process produces a kennicutt - schmidt - like law on average .",
    "if this were the case , the kennicutt - schmidt law implemented in our code would already _ implicitly _ account for the effects stellar self - regulation has on the scales our code resolves , and our ignorance on sub - kpc scale processes would be contained in the particular values of @xmath56 and @xmath60 .",
    "five out of the ten simulations ( the sf - a type simulations ) share the sf parameters ( @xmath63 gr @xmath64 , @xmath65 = 0.3 ) and differ in the seed used to build up the initial conditions . to test the role of sf parameterisation",
    ", the same initial conditions have been run with different sf parameters ( @xmath66 = @xmath67 gr @xmath64 , @xmath65 = 0.1 ) making sf more difficult , contributing another set of five simulations ( hereafter , the sf - b type simulations ) .",
    "elos have been identified in the simulations as those galaxy - like objects at @xmath68 having a prominent , non - rotating , dynamically relaxed spheroidal component made out of stars , with no extended discs and very low cold gas content .",
    "it turns out that , at @xmath0 , 26 ( 17 ) objects out of the more massive formed in sf - a ( sf - b ) type simulations fulfil this identification criterion , forming two samples ( the sf - a and sf - b elo samples ) partially analysed in sdts04 , in dss04 and in dtal06 . in oorbe",
    "et al . ( 2005 ) it is shown that both samples satisfy dynamical fp relations .",
    "elos in the sf - b sample tend to be of later type than their corresponding sf - a counterparts because forming stars becomes more difficult ; this is why many of the sf - b sample counterparts of the less massive elos in sf - a sample do not satisfy the selection criteria , and the sf - b sample has a lower number of elos that the sf - a sample .",
    "a visual examination of elos indicates that the stellar component is embedded in a dark matter halo , contributing an important fraction of the mass at distances from the elo centre larger than @xmath69 kpc on average .",
    "elos have also a hot , extended , x - ray emitting halo of diffuse gas ( siz , domnguez - tenreiro & serna 2003 ) .",
    "stellar and dark matter particles constitute a dynamically hot component with an important velocity dispersion , and , except in the very central regions , a positive anisotropy . in table",
    "[ tabhaloscale ] and table  [ tabetloscale ] different data on elos in the samples are given .",
    "in these tables , the criterion introduced in siz et al .",
    "2001 , elos have been labelled by a three  digit code formed by rounding their @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath9 coordinates in units where the simulated box has , at any redshift , a length of one .",
    "the number of particles of each species sampling each elo in the sample can be easily determined from these tables and the values of the masses of dark and baryonic particles .",
    "the spin parameters of the elo samples have an average value of @xmath72 .",
    "elo mass function is consistent with that of a small group environment ( cuesta - bolao & serna , private communication ) .",
    "the simulations show the physical patterns of elo mass assembly and star formation ( sf ) rate histories ( see dss04 and dtal06 for more details ) .",
    "elos form out of the mass elements that at high @xmath9 are enclosed by overdense regions whose mass scale ( total mass they enclose ) is of the order of an e galaxy total ( i.e. , including its halo ) mass .",
    "analytical models , as well as n - body simulations indicate that two different phases operate along halo mass assembly : first , a violent fast one , where the mass aggregation rates are high , and then , a slower one , with lower mass aggregation rates ( wechsler et al .",
    "2002 ; zhao et al . 2003 ; salvador - sol , manrique , & solanes 2005 ) .",
    "our hydrodynamical simulations indicate that the fast phase occurs through a multiclump collapse ( see thomas , greggio & bender 1999 ) ensuing turnaround of the overdense regions , and it is characterised by the fast head - on fusions experienced by the nodes of the cellular structure these regions enclose , resulting in strong shocks and high cooling rates of their gaseous component , and , at the same time , in strong and very fast star formation bursts that transform most of the available cold gas into stars .",
    "consequently , most of the dissipation involved in the mass assembly of a given elo occurs in this violent early phase at high @xmath9 .",
    "the slow phase comes after the multiclump collapse . in this phase ,",
    "the halo mass aggregation rate is low and the mass increments result from major mergers , minor mergers or continuous accretion .",
    "our cosmological simulations show that the fusion rates are generally low , and that a strong star formation burst and dissipation follow a major merger only if enough gas is still available after the early violent phase .",
    "this is very unlikely in any case , and it becomes more and more unlikely as the elo mass increases ( see dss04 ) . and so , these mergers imply only a modest amount of energy dissipation or star formation , but they play an important role in this slow phase : an @xmath1 50% of elos in the sample have experienced a major merger event at @xmath73 , that result in the increase of the elo mass content , size , and stellar mean square velocity .",
    "so , our simulations indicate that most of the stars of to - day ellipticals formed at high redshifts , while they are assembled later on ( see de lucia et al .",
    "2006 , for similar results from a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation grafted to the _ millennium simulation _ ) .",
    "this scenario shares some characteristics of previously proposed scenarios ( see discussion and references in dtal06 ) , but it has also significant differences , mainly that most stars form out of cold gas that had never been shock heated at the halo virial temperature and then formed a disk , as the conventional recipe for galaxy formation propounds ( see discussion in keres et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) .",
    "the virial radius describes the elo size _ at the scale of its dark matter halo_. it roughly encloses those particles that are bound into the self - gravitating configuration forming a given elo system ( i.e. , a dark matter halo plus the main baryonic compact object plus the substructures and satellites hosted by the dark matter halo ) .",
    "the virial radii have been calculated using the bryan & norman ( 1998 ) fitting formula , that yields , at @xmath0 , a value of @xmath74 for the mean density within @xmath75 in units of the critical density .",

    "we discuss the tilt and the scatter of the dynamical fp separately .",
    "we first address the tilt issue .",
    "we use at this stage for the @xmath94 and @xmath96 variables the averages over three orthogonal l.o.s .",
    "projections , to minimize the scatter in the plots caused by projection effects .",
    "figure  [ kappa ] plots the @xmath106 versus @xmath107 ( top ) and @xmath108 versus @xmath107 ( bottom ) diagrams for elos in both the sf - a and sf - b samples .",
    "we also drew the 2@xmath109 concentration ellipses in the respective variables , as well as its major and minor axes , for the sdss early - type galaxy sample in the sdss @xmath9 band ( solid lines ) and in the @xmath89 band ( point lines ) as analysed by bernardi et al .",
    "2003b , 2003c .",
    "the most outstanding feature of this figure ( upper panel ) is the good scaling behaviour of @xmath106 versus @xmath107 , with a very low scatter ( see the slopes @xmath110 in table  [ tabfp ] ; note that the slopes for the sf - a and sf - b samples are consistent within their errors , while the zero - points depend on the sf parameterisation through the elo sizes ) .",
    "another interesting feature of figure  [ kappa ] is that it shows that most of the values of the @xmath111 coefficients are within the 2@xmath109 concentration ellipses in both plots for elos formed in sf - a type simulations , with a slightly worse agreement for elos in the sf - b sample .",
    "this means that elos have counterparts in the real world ( siz et al .",
    "it is worth mentioning that these results are stable against slight changes in the values of the @xmath112 , @xmath113 or @xmath114 parameters ; for example , we have tested that using their preferred wmap values ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) shows results negligibly different to those plotted in figure  [ kappa ] .",
    "finally , we note that either the dynamical or the observed fps are not homogeneously populated : both sdss ellipticals and elos occupy only a region within these planes ( see figure  [ kappa ] lower panel , see also guzmn et al .",
    "1993 ; mrquez et al .",
    "this means that , from the point of view of their structure and dynamics , elos are a two - parameter family where the two parameters are not fully independent . moreover ,",
    "concerning elos , the occupied region changes when the sf parameters change .",
    "the reason of this change is that the elo sizes decrease as sf becomes more difficult , because the amount of dissipation experienced by the stellar component along elo assembly increases .",
    "we now turn to consider the scatter of the dynamical fp for the elo samples and compare it with the scatter of the fp for the sdss elliptical sample , calculated as the square root of the smallest eigenvalue of the 3@xmath1153 covariance matrix in the @xmath116 ( or @xmath117 ) , @xmath118 and @xmath119 variables ( saglia et al . 2001 ) . as figure  [ kappa ] suggests ,",
    "when projection effects are circumvented by taking averages over different directions , the resulting three dimensional orthogonal scatter for elos is smaller than for sdss ellipticals ( @xmath120 and @xmath121 for the sf - a and sf - b samples , respectively , to be compared with @xmath122 for the sdss in the @xmath123 and @xmath124 variables ) . to estimate the contribution of projection effects to the observed scatter",

    "the scatter ( @xmath125 and @xmath126 for the sf - a and sf - b samples ) increases , but it is still lower than observed .",

    "1998 ; trujillo et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we now address the issue of the physical origin of the tilt of elo idps relative to the virial relation . as discussed in @xmath42[intro ] , a non - zero tilt can be caused by a mass dependence of the mass - to - light ratio @xmath28 , of the mass structure coefficients @xmath127 , or of both of them .",
    "we examine these possibilities in turn .",
    "\\i ) we first note that the mass - to - light ratio can be written as :    @xmath128    where @xmath129 is the stellar mass - to - light ratio , that , as already explained , can be considered to be independent of the e galaxy luminosity or elo mass scale .",
    "figure  [ cmvirmob4.5 ] and the values of the @xmath130 slopes given in table  [ tabfp ] , indicate that the dark to bright mass content of elos increases with their mass , contributing a tilt to their idps .",

    "we see that the main contribution to the homology breaking comes from the @xmath138 coefficients ( i.e. , spatial homology breaking , see @xmath42[resbarobj ] and oorbe et al .",
    "2005 ) , while , as previously discussed , no dynamical homology breaking ( see @xmath42[glolosvdpar ] ) or projection effects are important in our elo samples .",
    "we present an analysis of the sample of elos formed in ten different cosmological simulations , run within the same global flat @xmath38 cosmological model , roughly consistent with observations .",
    "the normalisation parameter has been taken slightly high , @xmath46 , as compared with the average fluctuations of 2dfgrs or sdss galaxies to mimic an active region of the universe .",
    "newton laws and hydrodynamical equations have been integrated in this context , with a standard cooling algorithm and a star formation parameterization through a kennicutt - schmidt - like law , containing our ignorance about its details at sub - kpc scales .",
    "no further hypotheses to model the assembly processes have been made .",
    "individual galaxy - like objects naturally appear as an output of the simulations , so that the physical processes underlying mass assembly can be studied .",
    "five out of the ten simulations ( the sf - a type simulations ) share the sf parameters and differ in the seed used to build up the initial conditions . to test the role of sf parameterisation",
    ", the same initial conditions have been run with different sf parameters making sf more difficult , contributing another set of five simulations ( the sf - b type simulations ) .",
    "elos have been identified in the simulations as those galaxy - like objects at @xmath68 having a prominent , non - rotating dynamically relaxed spheroidal component made out of stars , with no extended discs and very low gas content .",
    "these stellar component is embedded in a dark matter halo that contributes an important fraction of the mass at distances from the elo centre larger than @xmath139 kpc .",

    "2003b for a similar result in sdss galaxies and dekel & birnboim 2006 , and cattaneo et al .",
    "2006 for a possible physical explanation ) .",
    "elos have also an extended halo of hot , diffuse gas .",
    "stellar and dark matter particles constitute a dynamically hot component with an important velocity dispersion , and , except in the very central regions , a positive anisotropy .",
    "the informations about position and velocity distributions of the elo particles of different kinds ( dark matter , stars , cold gas , hot gas ) provided by the simulations , allows a detailed study of their intrinsical three dimensional mass and velocity distributions , as well as a measure of the parameters characterising their structure and dynamics . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we report on the three dimensional mass density , circular velocity and velocity dispersion profiles , as well as the projected stellar mass density profiles and the los velocity dispersion profiles . in this paper",
    "we focus on a parameter analysis to quantify some of the previous results .",
    "mass , size and velocity dispersion scales for their different components have been measured in the elo samples , both at the scale of their halo and at the scale of the baryonic object ( a few tens of kiloparsecs ) . at the _ halo scale _ ,",
    "the masses of both cold gas and stars , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively , have been found to be tightly correlated with the halo total mass , @xmath2 , with the ratios @xmath142 and @xmath143 decreasing as @xmath2 increases ( that is , massive objects miss cold baryons within @xmath75 when compared with less massive elos ) , presumably because gas gets more difficulties to cool and fall as @xmath2 increases .",
    "the overall half - mass radii , @xmath24 shows also a very tight correlation with @xmath2 .",
    "half - mass radii for the cold baryon or stellar mass distributions have a more complex behaviour , as in these cases gas heating in shocks and energy losses due gas cooling are in competition to determine these distributions .",
    "a very important result we have found when analysing elos at the _ scale of the baryonic object _",
    ", is that @xmath2 plays an important role to determine the elo structure also below a few tens of kiloparsecs scales .",
    "in fact , both the masses of cold baryons @xmath144",
    "( i.e. , those baryons that have reached the central regions of the configuration ) , and of stars @xmath39 , show a good correlation with @xmath2 , and , moreover , the @xmath145 and @xmath146 ratios ( i.e. , the relative content of cold baryons or stars versus total mass ) decrease as @xmath2 increases .",
    "this is the same qualitative behaviour shown by these ratios observationally in the sdss data , and , also , by elos at the halo scale .",
    "the dependence of @xmath144 or @xmath39 on the sf parametrisation is only very slight , with sf - a type elos having slightly more stars than their sf - b type counterparts .",
    "the half - mass radii for cold baryon and stellar masses , @xmath147 and @xmath40 , show also a good correlation with @xmath2 , but now the values of the sf parameters also play a role , because their change implies a change in the time interval during which gas cooling is turned on , and this changes the elo stellar mass distribution , i.e. , its lenghthscale , so that elo compactness increases from sf - a to sf - b type simulations .",
    "another important result is that , regardless of the sf parametrizations used in this work , the relative distributions of the stellar and dark mass components in elos show a systematic trend measured through the @xmath148 ratios , with stars relatively more concentrated as @xmath2 decreases ( i.e. , a quantification of the spatial homology breaking ) .",
    "note that to compare with observational data , the relevant parameters are the _ projected _ half - mass radii , @xmath94 .",
    "we have checked that they show an excellent correlation with the corresponding three dimensional half - mass radii , with the @xmath149 ratios showing no significant dependence on the elo mass scale .    concerning kinematics ,",
    "a useful characterisation of the elo velocity dispersion is the central stellar line - of - sight velocity dispersion , @xmath3 , whose observational counterpart can be measured from elliptical spectra .",
    "a very important result is the very tight correlation we have found between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , confirming that the observationally measurable @xmath8 is a fair virial mass estimator .",
    "in addition , @xmath3 is closely related to the mean square velocity of both , the whole elliptical at the halo scale ( including the dark matter ) , @xmath23 , and the stellar component of the central object , @xmath41 .",
    "we have also found that the @xmath150 or the @xmath151 ratios are roughly independent of the elo mass scale . and",
    "so , elos do not show dynamically broken homology , even if their stellar and dark components are kinematically segregated ( i.e. , @xmath152 ) .",
    "this could lead to inaccurate determinations of the total mass of ellipticals when using stellar kinematics .",
    "a very important result is that , irrespective of the sf parameterisation , the ( logarithms of the ) elo stellar masses @xmath39 , stellar half - mass radii @xmath40 , and stellar mean square velocity of the central object @xmath41 , define _ intrinsic dynamical _ planes ( idps ) .",
    "these planes are tilted relative to the virial plane and the tilt does not significantly depend on the sf parameterisation , but the zero point does depend .",
    "otherwise , the intrinsic dynamical plane is not homogeneously populated , but elos , as well as e galaxies in the fp ( guzmn et al .",
    "1993 ) , occupy only a particular region defined by the range of their masses .      to make sure that the results we report in this paper are not unstable under resolution changes , a control simulation with 128@xmath48 dark matter and 128@xmath48 baryonic particles , a gravitational softening of @xmath153 kpc and the other parameters as in sf - a type simulations ( the s128 simulation ) , has been run .",
    "the results of its analysis have been compared with those of a 2 @xmath154 simulation ( the s64 simulation ) , whose initial conditions have been built up by randomly choosing 1 out of 8 particles in the s128 initial conditions , so that every elo in s128 has a counterpart in the lower resolution simulation and conversely . due to the very high cpu time requirements for s128",
    ", the comparison has been made at @xmath155 .",
    "the results of this comparison are very satisfactory , as figure  [ comcoc ] illustrates ( compare with figure  [ cmvirmob4.5 ] ) .",
    "the intrinsic dynamical planes and their occupations ( see   [ summary ] ) reflect the fact that dark matter haloes are a two - parameter family ( for example , the virial mass and the energy content or the concentration ; see , for example , hernquist 1990 ; navarro , frenk & white 1995 , 1996 ; manrique et al . 2003 ; navarro et al .",
    "2004 ) where the two parameters are correlated ( see , for example , bullock et al .",
    "2001 ; wechsler et al . 2002 ; manrique et al . 2003 ) .",
    "adding gas implies that heating and cooling processes also play a role at determining the mass and velocity distributions , and , more particularly , the length scales .",
    "however , as explained above , we have found that both , the relative content and the relative distributions of the dark and baryonic mass components show systematic trends with the elo mass scale , that can be written as power - laws of the form @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "a first consequence of the regularity of the trends with the mass scale found in this paper is that no new parameters are added relative to the dark matter halo family , so that the baryonic objects are also a two - parameter family , and elo structural and dynamical parameters define also a plane .",
    "a second consequence is that the plane is tilted relative to the halo plane ( i.e. , the virial plane ) because @xmath158 .",
    "finally , the plane is not homogeneously populated because of the mass - concentration halo correlation , that at the scale of the baryonic objects appears for example as a mass  size correlation .",
    "this explains the role played by @xmath2 to determine the intrinsic three dimensional correlations . in this paper",
    "we also show that @xmath3 is a fair empirical estimator of @xmath2 , and this explains the central role played by @xmath8 at determining the observational correlations .",
    "the fundamental plane shown by real elliptical samples is the observationally manifestation of the idps when using projected parameters @xmath94 , @xmath3 and luminosity variables instead of stellar masses @xmath39 .",
    "we have taken advantage of the constancy of the stellar - mass - to - light ratios of ellipticals in the sdss ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003a , 2003b ) to put the elliptical sample of bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003b , 2003c ) in the same projected variables we can measure in our virtual ellipticals .",
    "we have found that the fps shown by the two elo samples are consistent with that shown by the sdss elliptical sample in the same variables , with no further need for any relevant contribution from stellar population effects to explain the observed tilt .",
    "these effects could , however , have contributed to the scatter of the observed fp , as the idps have been found to be thinner than the observed fp .",
    "we now turn to discuss the physical origin of the trends given by the power laws @xmath156 and @xmath157 . as explained in section 2 ,",
    "the simulations provide us with clues on the physical processes involved in elliptical formation ( see also dss04 and dtal06 ) .",
    "they also indicate that the dynamical plane appears at an early violent phase as a consequence of elo assembly out of gaseous material , with cooling and on short timescales , and it is preserved during a later , slower phase , where dissipationless merging plays an important role in stellar mass assembly ( see more details in dtal06 ) .",
    "our simulations show that the physical origin of the trends above lie in the systematic decrease , with increasing elo mass , of the relative amount of dissipation experienced by the baryonic mass component along elo stellar mass assembly ( dtal06 ; oorbe et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this possibility had been suggested by bender et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , guzmn et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and ciotti et al .",
    "bekki ( 1998 ) first addressed it numerically in the framework of the merger hypothesis for elliptical formation through pre - prepared simulations of dissipative mergers of disk galaxies , where the rapidity of the star formation in mergers is controlled by a free efficiency parameter @xmath159 .",
    "he shows that the star formation rate history of galaxies determine the differences in dissipative dynamics , so that to explain the slope of the fp he _ needs to assume _ that more luminous galaxies are formed by galaxy mergers with a shorter timescale for gas transformation into stars .",
    "recently , robertson et al . ( 2006 ) have confirmed these findings on the importance of dissipation to explain the fp tilt .    in this paper",
    "we go an step further and analyze the fp of virtual ellipticals formed in a cosmological context , where individual galaxy - like objects naturally appear as an output of the simulations .",
    "our results essentially include previous ones and add important new informations .",
    "first , our results on the role of dissipation to produce the tilt of the fp essentially agree with those obtained through dissipative pre - prepared mergers , but it is important to note that , moreover , more massive objects produced in the simulations _ do have _ older means and narrower spreads in their stellar age distributions than less massive ones ( see details dss04 ) ; this naturally appears in the simulations and need not be considered as an additional assumption .",
    "second , the preservation of the fp in the slow phase of mass aggregation in our simulations also agrees with previous work based on dissipationless simulations of pre - prepared mergers ( capelato et al . 1995 ; dantas et al . 2003 ; gozlez - garca & van albada 2003 ; boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "2005 ; nipoti , londrillo & ciotti 2003 ) .",
    "moreover , elliptical properties recently inferred from observations ( for example , the appearence of blue cores , menanteau et al . 2004 , and the increase of the stellar mass contributed by the elliptical population since higher @xmath9 , bell et al . 2004 ; conselice , blackburne , & papovich 2005 ; faber et al . 2005 ; see more details in dtal06 ) can also be explained in our simulations .",
    "we conclude that the simulations provide an unified scenario where most current observations on ellipticals can be interrelated .",
    "in particular , it explains the most important results relative to the physical origin of their fp relation ( i.e. the fp tilt is due dissipative dynamics , and disipationless merging in the slow growth phase of mass assembly does not change the tilt ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this scenario shares some characteristics of previously proposed scenarios , but it has also significant differences , mainly that most stars in elliptical galaxies form out of cold gas that had never been shock heated at the halo virial temperature and then formed a disk , as the conventional recipe for galaxy formation propounds ( see discussion in keres et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) .",
    "the scenario for elliptical formation emerging from our simulations has the advantage that it results from simple physical laws acting on initial conditions that are realizations of power spectra consistent with observations of cmb anisotropies .",
