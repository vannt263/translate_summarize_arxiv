    "[ mr ]    while rhic and lhc have been excellent laboratories to study hot and high energy qcd , neutron stars are unique cosmic laboratories to study cold dense qcd . solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation for a given qcd equation of state",
    ", one can predict neutron star mass - radius ( @xmath6-@xmath7 ) relations which are observable .",
    "this procedure is invertible @xcite ; one can directly reconstruct the qcd equation of state once the @xmath6-@xmath7 relation is established from observation .",
    "although the @xmath6-@xmath7 curve is not determined precisely because of uncertainties in the radius determinations , current observations already provide tight constraints on equations of state .",
    "our objective in this talk is to delineate properties of qcd matter , in light of equations of state inferred from current neutron star constraints .",
    "as discussed by lattimer and prakash @xcite , the features of the @xmath6-@xmath7 curve are determined by the pressures at different densities , see fig .",
    "[ mr ] ( left ) .",
    "the overall radii are correlated with equations of state at , baryon density ; @xmath8 , nuclear saturation density ; @xmath9 , quark chemical potential ; @xmath10 , pressure ; @xmath11 , energy density ; @xmath12 , speed of sound ) ; @xmath13 , temperature ; and @xmath14 , nucleon mass .",
    "we take natural units , @xmath15 . ]",
    "@xmath2 ; stiffer ( softer ) equations of state lead to larger ( smaller ) radii at given @xmath11 , not to be confused with @xmath10 at given @xmath9 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ mr ] ( right ) . ] . at higher density",
    "the @xmath6-@xmath7 curve increases upward in the vertical direction without significant change in the radius ; its slope is determined by the pressure at @xmath16 .",
    "the maximum mass is determined by the pressure at @xmath17 . in fig.[mr ] ( right ) we also indicate the stiffness in terms of @xmath18 .    the above discussion can be combined with three constraints : ( i ) the existence of two neutron stars of two solar masses ( @xmath19 ) @xcite requires stiff equations of state at @xmath17 ; ( ii ) the recent indications in neutron star radii analyses of rather small star radii @xmath20 @xcite , suggesting soft equations of state at @xmath2 ; and ( iii ) thermodynamic and causality constraints on the speed of sound , @xmath21 . while the analyses are not as precise as the mass determinations , soft equations of state at low density are actually consistent with danielewitz s constraint @xcite obtained from heavy ion data and recent monte - carlo many - body calculations @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile all these constraints simultaneously by constructing an equation of state that is soft at low density and stiff at high density . by definition ,",
    "stiff equations of state have larger @xmath10 at given @xmath11 .",
    "thus the curve connecting these soft and stiff domains tends to contain rather large @xmath22 and has the danger of violating constraint ( iii ) . in this way , the three conditions impose constraints one another .",
    "if we ignored , for instance , the radius constraint ( ii ) , then we have only to construct an equation of state which is stiff from low to high densities and thereby satisfy the constraints ( i ) and ( iii ) .",
    "but in this work all these constraints are included in constructing equations of state .",
    "following masuda - hatsuda - takatsuka @xcite , we consider the 3-window modeling of the qcd matter in which three domains are separately discussed ( fig.[fig:3-window ] ) : ( a ) at @xmath23 , nuclear matter is dilute and nucleons exchange only few mesons , allowing one to use sophisticated nuclear many - body calculations ; ( b ) at @xmath24 , nucleons start to exchange many mesons ( or quarks ) and many - body forces become increasingly important . with many quark exchanges",
    "it is natural to expect modifications of hadronic wavefunctions .",
    "it is also in this density region where hyperons begin to emerge , causing softening problems ; ( c ) at @xmath25 baryon wavefunctions spatially overlap and quarks begin to travel around ( percolation ) , forming quark matter .",
    "nevertheless the matter is strongly correlated ; in fact perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations predict that the weak coupling expansion @xcite does not converge well below @xmath26 , indicating that non - perturbative gluons are still important at densities relevant for neutron stars , @xmath27 .    in practice",
    ", we use for the purely nuclear descriptions below @xmath28 , the sly equation state for @xmath29 @xcite and the akmal - pandharipande - ravenhall ( apr ) equation of state @xcite for @xmath30 . for percolated",
    "quark matter above @xmath31 , we use quark models inspired from hadron and nuclear physics . in the intermediate region",
    ", we construct an equation of state by simply interpolating the apr and quark model equations of state .",
    "the interpolation variable is @xmath18 , and we match it to apr and quark pressures at @xmath32 and @xmath33 such that @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively ( e.g. , fig.[mr ] ( right ) ) .",
    "the matching conditions are imposed up to the second derivative of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath9 . for details ,",
    "@xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the 3-window modeling is quite different from the conventional hybrid modeling based on a maxwell construction . in the latter , hadronic and",
    "percolated quark matter equations of state are considered as distinct , and as @xmath9 increases , the quark matter pressure @xmath36 must intersect with the hadronic pressure @xmath37 from below and then stay larger than @xmath37 .",
    "( this is necessary to have hadronic matter at low density and quark matter at high density . ) for this to happen , the quark pressure must grow sufficiently fast as @xmath9 increases , but such equations of state are soft .",
    "thus conventional modeling excludes stiff quark pressure curves .",
    "in particular , if we choose a soft hadronic equation of state , as implied by the radius constraint , it is very difficult to make quark equations of state stiff enough to satisfy the @xmath19 constraint .",
    "the conventional hybrid construction , however , has fundamental weakness ; as we noted , purely hadronic and percolated quark matter pictures are valid in different domains so that it is not quite possible to reliably compare the two pressures .",
    "especially it is not reasonable to use the _ extrapolated _ hadronic pressure at high density to reject stiff quark matter equations of state .",
    "in contrast , the 3-window construction does not utilize an extrapolated hadronic pressure , and one can construct stiff quark equations of state independent of the extrapolated hadronic pressure .",
    "an example is shown in fig.[mr ] ( right ) .",
    "this allows us to consider quark equations of state that have not been fully explored .",
    "it is instructive to quote an example where the difference between the conventional and 3-window constructions appear clearly : qcd at finite @xmath13 . at low @xmath13 the qcd pressure",
    "is described well by a non - interacting hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model .",
    "but at @xmath38 , the pseudo - critical chiral phase transition temperature , the hrg pressure starts to overshoot the qcd pressure calculated in the lattice qcd .",
    "this occurs because near @xmath39 thermally excited hadrons begin to overlap and the interactions among them become important . on the other hand , at high @xmath13 pqcd calculations",
    "seem to work , but when we extrapolate the results toward low temperature , around @xmath40 pqcd the pressure starts to overshoot the lattice qcd pressure ; the lack of confining effects allows colored excitations to contribute to the pressure .",
    "if we treated the hrg and pqcd pressures as real at all @xmath13 we would unrealistically find the deconfined phase at low @xmath13 and the hadronic phase at high @xmath13 .",
    "this example illustrates the danger of trusting that the extrapolated pressure describes real physics . on the other hand ,",
    "the 3-window construction restricts the use of the hrg pressure to @xmath41 and pqcd pressure to @xmath42 , and then interpolates between them to reproduce the qualitatively correct result .",
    "we expect a similar utility for cold dense qcd .",
    "[ njl ]      we use the hatsuda - kunihiro parameter set for ( @xmath51 ) , the uv cutoff @xmath52 , and current quark masses @xcite . the diquark and vector couplings ( @xmath47 , @xmath53 )",
    "are treated as free parameters .",
    "because of medium effects , in principle the parameters in the percolated domain can be different from their vacuum counterparts .",
    "our goal is to constrain these parameters at @xmath3 by neutron star constraints , and then delineate properties of strongly correlated matter from the behaviors of these parameters @xcite .",
    "the impact of each term is as follows : ( i ) with the standard njl model alone , our 3-window equations of state can not pass the @xmath19 constraint .",
    "( ii ) increasing @xmath53 from zero can increase the stiffness ( fig .",
    "[ njl ] left ) .",
    "however , the large @xmath53 also introduces a problem when we interpolate between the low and high density pressures ; the quark model pressure at larger @xmath53 tends to appear at higher @xmath9 , so that the interpolating curve tends to have inflection points , and thus a region of negative curvature , @xmath54 . in this region",
    "the compressibility is negative , @xmath55 , and the system is unstable ; the interpolating curve must be regarded as unphysical .",
    "( iii ) the problem of the negative curvature can be cured by increasing @xmath47 which shifts the quark pressure curve toward low @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ njl ] right ) . this shift can be expected if one recalls the @xmath56-@xmath57 splitting in the constituent quark models , where the attractive force reduces the constituent quark mass of @xmath58 to ( or below ) one - third of nucleon mass .",
    "sufficiently large @xmath47 erases the inflection points .    at @xmath59",
    ", one can construct pressure curves that satisfy three conditions discussed in sec.1 .",
    "the radius is about @xmath60 which is mainly determined by the apr equation of state .",
    "the @xmath19 constraint can be satisfied by taking @xmath61 .",
    "the thermodynamic and causality constraints require larger @xmath47 for larger @xmath53 to remove the inflection points ; @xmath47 should be @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "note that the neutron star constraints require model parameters at @xmath63 as large as the vacuum njl coupling @xmath64 .",
    "this is the main finding from our exercise .",
    "we claim that this is a signal that the gluons remain non - perturbative as in the qcd vacuum , since quark models reflect the gluon dynamics in terms of effective couplings ; if gluons become perturbative , the quark model couplings should be much smaller than the vacuum values , causing severe softening problems .",
    "these problems include chiral restoration at low @xmath9 and the necessity to add the gluon bag constant , both of which substantially soften equations of state .",
    "thus we infer the existence of quark matter with non - perturbative gluons , which was conceptualized by mclerran and pisarski @xcite .    in the present study we used smooth curves for the interpolation , assuming the crossover from hadronic to quark matter .",
    "this possibility is feasible especially when we demand neutron star radii to be small , @xmath65 , or equations of state to be soft at low density and stiff at high density .",
    "this condition disfavors strong bending in the interpolated pressure which would appear at a first order phase transition point . if the radii turn out to be large , @xmath66",
    ", one can allow very stiff hadronic pressure with which the quark pressure can remain stiff even after the first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "the precise radius estimates , which still need confirmation , have direct implications on the nature of qcd phase diagram .",
