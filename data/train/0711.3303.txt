    "the suppression of single inclusive high @xmath0 hadrons in heavy - ion collisions as compared to the scaled expectation from p - p collision has long been regarded as caused by energy loss of high @xmath2 partons into a dense partonic environment @xcite . at rhic ,",
    "the nuclear suppression factor @xmath1 for pions in central au - au collisions has been measured out to 20 gev @xcite and a factor @xmath3 suppression observed .",
    "the hope of using hard probes such as the single hadron suppression in the context of heavy - ion collisions is to infer properties of the medium and its density evolution from induced changes relative to the corresponding known hard process in p - p collisions .",
    "there is , however , growing evidence that single hadron suppression is not enough to unambiguously determine even the distribution of energy / momentum shifts of partons traversing the medium @xcite .",
    "however , if energy loss can not be determined reliably in momentum space , there is little hope to try to infer the qcd matter density distribution in position space .",
    "back - to - back correlations of hard hadrons @xcite are a more differential hard process . due to the different geometrical averaging in the case of single hadron suppression vs. back - to - back suppression",
    ", one may hope to obtain information about the spatial distribution of dense medium from combining the two observables .",
    "while theoretical studies for back - to - back correlations as measured at rhic have been done @xcite , they seem to indicate that for rhic kinematics the amount of additional information is not substantial , in essence various models for the energy loss mechanism and for the density evolution which describe single hadron suppression also perform well when compared with dihadron suppression .",
    "the notable exception is a class of energy loss models based on a purely linear dependence of the energy loss with pathlength  those seem to be strongly disfavoured by back - to - back correaltions @xcite .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , the reason why there is only little sensitivity to the qcd matter density distribution at rhic kinematics may be that the lever - arm in momentum is not large enough to probe substantial shifts in parton momentum  for a steeply falling parton spectrum , even a moderate shift in parton momentum effectively resembles an absorption of partons , and this fact greatly reduces the sensitivity . at the lhc however where the partonic @xmath2 range is large this ceases to be a problem and consequently the suppression of hard back - to - back correlated hadrons becomes a promising probe .    in this paper , we aim to provide a baseline prediction for the per - trigger yield in hard back - to - back correlations .",
    "this complements a baseline prediction of the nuclear suppression factor @xmath1 @xcite made within the same model framework .",
    "we compare with the calculation at rhic kinematics and point out similarities and differences .",
    "as in @xcite we calculate the correlation strength of hadrons back to back with a hard trigger in a monte - carlo ( mc ) simulation .",

    "@xcite it has been demonstrated that leading order ( lo ) perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) is rather successful in describing the @xmath0-spectrum of inclusive hadron production over a wide range in @xmath4 when supplemented with a @xmath4-dependent @xmath5-factor to adjust the overall normalization .",
    "this factor parametrizes next - to - leading order effects .",
    "since we are in the following only interested in ratios of @xmath0-distributions , i.e. yields per triggered hadron , any factor independent of @xmath0 drops out .",
    "hence , in the following we use lo pqcd expressions without trying to adjust the absolute normalization .",
    "the production of two hard partons @xmath6 with transverse momentum @xmath2 in lo pqcd is described by    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 stand for the colliding objects ( protons or nuclei ) and @xmath10 is the rapidity of parton @xmath11 .",

    "while summing over all allowed combinations of @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath22 where @xmath23 stands for any of the quark flavours @xmath24 we find the relative strength of different combinations of outgoing partons as a function of @xmath2 .    for the present investigation , we require @xmath25 , i.e. we consider only back - to - back correlations detected at midrapidity . in the first step ,",
    "we sample eq .",
    "( [ e-2parton ] ) summed over all @xmath6 to generate @xmath2 for the event . in the second step",
    "we perform a mc sampling of the decomposition of eq .",
    "( [ e-2parton ] ) according to all possible combinations of outgoing partons @xmath6 at the @xmath2 obtained in the first step .",
    "we thus end with a back - to - back parton pair with known parton types and flavours at transverse momentum @xmath2 .    to account for various effects , including higher order pqcd radiation , transverse motion of partons in the nucleon ( nuclear ) wave function and effectively also the fact that hadronization is not a collinear process , we fold into the distribution @xmath26 an intrinsic transverse momentum @xmath27 with a gaussian distribution , thus creating a momentum imbalance between the two partons as @xmath28 .",
    "we use a value of @xmath29 gev for rhic kinematics @xcite and observe a sensitivity of less than 10% of the away side yield to changes of this number by @xmath30% . while @xmath27 is expected to rise at lhc conditions , in the momentum region we wish to explore , i.e. @xmath31 gev there is no sensitivity of the calculation to the choice of intrinsic transverse momentum .",
    "before we can count hadrons above certain trigger or associate - momentum threshold , we have to convert the simulated partons into hadrons .",
    "more precisely , in order to determine whether there is a trigger hadron @xmath32 above a given threshold , given a parton @xmath33 with momentum @xmath2 , we need to sample @xmath34 , i.e. the probability distribution to find a hadron @xmath32 from the parton @xmath33 where @xmath32 is _ the most energetic hadron of the shower _ and carries the momentum @xmath35 .    in previous works @xcite we have approximated this by the normalized fragmentation function @xmath36 , sampled with a lower cutoff @xmath37 which is adjusted to the reference d - au data .",
    "this procedure can be justified by noting that only one hadron with @xmath38 can be produced in a shower , thus above @xmath39 the distributions @xmath40 and @xmath34 are ( up to the scale evolution ) identical , and only in the region of low @xmath41 where the fragmentation function describes the production of multiple hadrons do they differ significantly .",
    "however , for a fixed cut in the hadronic momentum @xmath0 , low @xmath41 implies probing the high @xmath2 part of a steeply falling parton spectrum , thus this region is suppressed .",
    "empirically , sampling @xmath40 has provided a good description of the baseline @xcite .",
    "however , at the lhc energies , keeping the same lower cutoff @xmath37 is not acceptable as it would imply that there is no perturbative production of hadrons in the range below , say , 8 gev from a 100 gev parton .",
    "presumably , a viable solution would be to readjust the cutoff to a measured set of reference data from p - p collisions . in the absence of such a data set ,",
    "we have chosen a different path by extracting @xmath34 from shower simulations of quarks and gluons in pythia @xcite .",
    "this moreover has an additional advantage , since there is a subtle point with the scale dependence of the hadronization functions . while @xmath40 is an empirical function where the scale is set by the produced hadron and the function",
    "is folded with the full parton spectrum ( so that @xmath42 ) , @xmath34 is an object where the scale is set by the given parton energy and the outcome of the folding is a distribution of hadron momenta .",
    "the latter is more appropriate for the situation realized in the mc simulation in which the partonic @xmath2 is fixed before hadronization .    in fig .",

    "the differences are sizeable at higher @xmath41 .",
    "we do not wish to enter a discussion of the physics origin of these differences at this point but rather accept @xmath49 from pythia as a trial ansatz which needs to be tested against data .",
    "using @xmath34 on both outgoing partons from the primary pqcd vertex ( see eq .",
    "[ e-2parton ] ) we find the two most energetic hadrons from both showers .",
    "following the experimental analysis procedure , out of the two we define the harder one to be the trigger hadron if it passes a set momentum cut , otherwise we ignore the event .",
    "the direction of the trigger hadron is taken to be the @xmath50 direction and the hemisphere corresponding to this direction is referred to as near side , the opposite hemisphere is then defined to be the away side.    in order to compute the strength of hadrons correlated with a trigger on the away side , the leading contribution is found by considering the leading hadron produced from the away side parton for which @xmath51 is sufficient . however , in order to determine the correlation strength on the near side , the production of ( at least ) one more energetic hadron in the shower needs to be considered as the leading contribution here corresponds to the trigger hadron itself . thus , note that to the same level of approximation of the shower development the near side correlation is only found at next - to - leading ( nl ) fragmentation whereas an away side correlation appears already at leading fragmentation and receives a correction at next - to - leading fragmentation .    in our framework",
    ", we treat this next - to - leading contribution through the conditional probability density @xmath52 which for fixed @xmath53 corresponds to a probability density , i.e. @xmath54 .",

    "we have re - run the simulation taking into account only the leading fragmentation term @xmath49 and find that this contribution alone seems to do well with the data .    since the trigger is always chosen to be the most energetic hadron in the simulation",
    ", there is considerable bias towards the trigger parton being a quark , as the quark fragmentation is harder ( cf .",
    "[ f - ffcomp ] ) . in the kinematical range probed , the @xmath116 subprocess is rather important , thus there is a bias towards a gluon being the away side parton .",
    "we note from fig .",
    "[ f - ffcomp ] that the discrepancy between the gluon fragmentation function and @xmath117 is larger than for quarks .",
    "quite likely , this discrepancy also propagates into the extraction of @xmath118 from pythia and is the reason that the present calculation shows differences here relative to the data ( and to previous results @xcite ) .",
    "the eventual solution to this discrepancy would be to find a different way to extract @xmath49 and @xmath52 than pythia shower simulations .",
    "however , since the overall description of the data seems to be reasonable , we proceed with the hadronization procedure as introduced above , but assign an uncertainty to the simulations of the heavy - ion case which we estimate by calculating the results with and without @xmath52 on the away side .      in the next step ,",

    "the resulting yields per trigger as a function of associate hadron momentum for near and away side are shown in fig .",
    "[ f - auau ] .",
    "we observe that the yield on the near side is almost identical to the calculated yield in d - au collisions and systematically below the data",
    ". one way of resolving the discrepancy while retaining agreement with the d - au data could be the inclusion of nnl fragmentation processes . due to the large errors in the d - au measurement",
    ", this would not destroy the agreement with the baseline . while a full computation of the nnl conditional fragmentation probability distribution @xmath119 is very involved , we have checked that the approximation    @xmath120    produces the right order of magnitude to agree with the data .",
    "a different possibility is a sizeable contribution of coalescence processes @xcite in the au - au case to the near side hadron yield which is not included in the calculation .",
    "if coalescence processes are relevant , one would expect to systematically underestimate the data . given the large uncertainty of the baseline d - au measurement and the theoretical uncertainty in the shower modelling using pythia",
    ", it is unfortunately impossible to make a definite statement what the relevant physics process underlying the discrepancy is .    on the away side ,",
    "the calculation shows good agreement in both the 4 - 6 gev and the 6 + gev momentum bin .",
    "however , given that the calculation overshoots the d - au baseline in the lower momentum bin , one has to conclude that the agreement in this bin is accidental .",
    "this is clearly confirmed by omitting nl fragmentation on the away side ( which restores agreement with the baseline ) : doing so results in an underprediction of this bin just as observed in our previous calculation @xcite which is consistent with the observation that coalescence processes @xcite play a substantial role for hadronization in this momentum region .    in fig .",
    "[ f - z_t ] , we show the distribution of @xmath121 on the away side in d - au and central au - au collisions and compare with data .",
    "we observe a general tendency that the calculation slightly underestimates the data in the high @xmath61 region .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that there is a trend that the calculation may underestimate the higher associate momentum window slightly .",
    "however , within errors , the results are compatible .",
    "we compute the expected correlation strength pattern for an energy of 5.5 atev for p - p collisions and pb - pb collisions as expected to take place at the cern lhc . for the trigger range",
    ", we assume 50 - 70 gev to probe a regime which can be accessed at lhc but is beyond the reach of the rhic experiment .    since our formalism includes shower development only to the second term @xmath52 , the associate hadron momentum cuts can not be too low , otherwise the main contribution to hadron production can not be assumed to be dominated by the leading and next to leading hadron .",
    "thus , we start considering associate hadron production for 20 gev and above up to the trigger energy in 5 gev momentum windows . in order to account for the uncertainty with regard to the nl fragmentation on the away side",
    "as discussed earlier , we carry out the simulation both including and excluding this contribution to provide an error estimate .    in fig .",
    "[ f - pbpb ] we show the resulting yield per trigger on the near and away side .",
    "let us first focus on the away side ( right panel ) .",
    "regardless if one uses nl fragmentation contributions or not , there is a suppression of the away - side yield when going from p - p to pb - pb collisions of about a factor 3 .",
    "this is comparable with the factor 4 suppression observed at rhic .",
    "the similarity is not quite unexpected , since in the range of the trigger momentum the same model predicts a single hadron suppression factor of about the magnitude seen at rhic @xcite .",
    "the underlying reason is that the ratio between the typical scale of energy loss vs. the momentum scale probed is similar and the change in characteristic length scales between central au - au and central pb - pb is negligible .",
    "up to a momentum scale of about 35 gev , there is an uncertainty associated with nl fragmentation , for higher momenta the uncertainty goes away .",
    "let us now focus on the near side ( left panel in fig .",
    "[ f - pbpb ] ) : here we observe that the yield per trigger is enhanced by 10 - 20% in pb - pb relative to to p - p collisions . at first glance , this seems to be surprising .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the model still includes a strong suppression of trigger hadrons , only the per - trigger yield is enhanced .",
    "these findings can be reconciled by the observation that the dense medium at lhc acts like a gluon filter and in essence enhances the relative abundance of quarks escaping the medium to gluons escaping the medium .",
    "the underlying reason is that gluons , due to their different color charge , couple more strongly to the medium than quarks and consequently lose more energy .",
    "however , due to the harder leading and nl fragmentation , quark jets on average produce harder associated yield than gluon jets , which is precisely what is seen in the simulation .    finally , in fig .  [ f - pshift ] we take a closer look at the momentum spectrum of hadrons recoiling from the trigger . to first order ,",
    "one finds the reduction by a factor three mentioned above when going from p - p to pb - pb collisions .",
    "this would be consistent with complete absorption of 2/3 of all partons whereas 1/3 passes the medium without any energy loss .",
    "however , as a closer comparison reveals , there is a momentum dependent distortion of the spectra in heavy - ion collisions which is associated with events in which an away - side parton emerges from the medium after a finite energy loss @xmath95 . from this @xmath2",
    "dependent shift of the spectrum , one can in principle derive constraints about the averaged energy loss probability @xmath122 and hence about the medium density distribution .",
    "we have made a baseline prediction for the expected per - trigger yield of associate hadrons as a function of transverse momentum in central pb - pb collisions at 5.5 atev for a trigger energy of 50 - 70 gev .",
    "we have demonstrated that the effect of the medium is expected to leave a characteristic imprint in the observables .    on the near side",
    ", we expect enhancement of the associate hadron yield as compared to the p - p case due to the fact that energy loss of gluons is stronger , hence there is some bias towards quarks leading to a trigger hadron , and the fact that the nl fragmentation for quarks is harder leads to a slight enhancement in the relevant momentum region .    on the away side",
    ", we expect a substantial suppression of the yield as compared to the p - p case , although the suppression we find is in relative terms smaller than what is currently observed at rhic .",
    "we have further shown that the shape of the momentum spectrum of away - side hadrons is not equal to the momentum spectrum expected for p - p collisions .",
    "this is because the medium does not only act by absorbing partons , but one gets a chance to observe the characteristic shift in parton energy induced by the medium .",
    "this allows a more detailed view on the geometry - averaged energy loss probability distribution . in this respect ,",
    "the observable shows a potential which may not be accessible at rhic kinematics .",
    "there are multiple uncertainties associated with this prediction at each step of the mc simulation . in the lo pqcd calculation",
    ", both nlo corrections and the choice of the nuclear parton distribution functions result in an uncertainty , especially as the role of gluon shadowing can not be reliably extrapolated to the lhc regime .",
    "however , we have tested that the difference between the npdf @xcite and the eks98 @xcite nuclear parton distribution sets is smaller than the statistical errors of the mc simulation . while the yield of partons at given @xmath2 is sensitive to the nuclear parton distribution ,",
    "the associated per - trigger yield is not since many uncertainties cancel in the ratio .",
    "there is likewise an uncertainty associated with the choice of the hadronization scheme .",
    "we have tried to show the magnitude of this uncertainty by comparing with available rhic data and by indicating the relative magnitude of the leading and next - to - leading fragmentation term in the prediction .",
    "a large uncertainty must also be assigned to the hydrodynamical prediction of the underlying medium evolution . at present , neither entropy production and the distribution in the initial state nor the equilibration process or the equation of state governing a hydrodynamical expansion are precisely known .",

    "<S> the suppression of high transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) inclusive hadron spectra in heavy - ion collisions as compared to the scaled expectation of high @xmath0 hadron production in p - p collisions is the most direct manifestation of the interaction of hard partons with the soft bulk medium produced in heavy - ion collisions which is absent in p - p collisions . yet </S>",
    "<S> the measured nuclear suppression factor @xmath1 is a very averaged quantity and hence only a limited amount of information about the medium evolution and the nature of the interaction with the medium can be deduced from @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of hard back - to - back hadron correlations in 200 agev au - au collisions at rhic have opened a new window to study the energy loss of partons in a medium in a more differential way and for a different distribution of in - medium pathlengths than in the case of @xmath1 . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we present an extrapolation of our results for back - to - back yields at rhic energies to 5.5 tev pb - pb collisions at the cern lhc . </S>",
