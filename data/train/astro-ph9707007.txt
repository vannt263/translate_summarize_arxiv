    "35 is a pair of galaxies catalogued in zwicky ( 1971 ) as a 16th  magnitude compact blue double .",
    "its systemic velocity , based on observations of co emission ( @xcite ) , is 8289  ( heliocentric , optical definition ) , corresponding to a distance of 110mpc ( @xmath6mpc ; 1mas is equivalent to a projected separation of 0.53pc ) .",
    "optical and ir images ( @xcite ) show two components separated by @xmath7 along a position angle of @xmath8 . in optical images ,",
    "the northern galaxy is brighter and redder than the southern , and emits the majority of its energy in the far infrared ; _ iras _ measured its @xmath9 m luminosity to be @xmath10 , with a spectral energy distribution consistent with thermal emission from dust at 65k .",
    "chapman  ( 1990 ) classify the northern galaxy as either a liner or seyfert  2 , based on optical emission line ratios .",
    "the nucleus of the northern component of 35 is the site of strong oh maser emission .",
    "the total luminosity in the 1667mhz transition , assuming isotropic emission , is @xmath11 , with a ratio of flux density in the 1667 and 1665mhz spectral peaks of 9:1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 1667mhz spectrum has two peaks at approximately @xmath12  from the systemic velocity .",
    "the maser extends in doppler velocity over about 100 , but there is also faint ( @xmath13mjy ) blueshifted emission extending more than 500  from .",
    "baan , haschick , & henkel ( 1989 ) interpret the blueshifted wings in this and other oh maser galaxies to be due to molecular outflows .",
    "chapman  ( 1990 ) imaged the @xmath14 cm continuum emission from 35 with the vla and merlin and measured a flux density of @xmath15mjy and an angular size of @xmath16mas ( @xmath17k ) .",
    "the centroid of the maser emission was observed to coincide with that of the 18 cm continuum to within @xmath18 . assuming the maser acts as an unsaturated amplifier and completely covers the continuum",
    ", they inferred an apparent peak oh optical depth @xmath19 .",
    "montgomery & cohen ( 1992 ) mapped the oh maser emission with merlin and observed an extended ( @xmath20mas ) structure with an apparent velocity gradient of 2.5pc  along a position angle of @xmath21 .",
    "they interpreted the gradient to be the signature of a rotating molecular disk in the nucleus of 35 .",
    "we observed 35 on 25 march 1995 at @xmath14 cm with the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) in spectral  line mode . only the stations at fort davis , kitt peak , los alamos , north liberty , owens valley and pie town provided useful data .",
    "the baseline fringe spacings ranged from 17 to 200mas .",
    "the data were recorded in both left and right circular polarization , in two 8mhz passbands centered on @xmath22 and 7000 .",
    "the former covers both the 1667mhz and the 1665mhz transitions of oh , while the latter was tuned to lie outside the known range of maser emission .",
    "the data were correlated at nrao ; each passband was divided into 512 spectral channels , yielding a doppler velocity spacing of 2.8 .",
    "all further processing was undertaken with aips at the cfa .",
    "after initial calibration of the amplitudes , fringe rates , and delays , the visibilities were phase  referenced to the channel of the peak line emission , at 8245 .",
    "analysis of residual fringe rates established the position of the maser peak : @xmath23 , @xmath24 . an error in this reference position during processing resulted in a systematic error in the positions of spectral features that scales linearly with frequency offset from the maser peak .",
    "the magnitude of this error is @xmath25masmhz ; the resulting systematic errors are @xmath26mas in the 1667mhz line profile , and @xmath27mas in the 1665mhz line profile .",
    "the 1@xmath28 noise level in a uniformly  weighted spectral channel image was 3.8mjy / beam .",
    "spectral channels in the lower  frequency passband were averaged to produce continuum visibilities .",
    "the 1@xmath28 noise level in a uniformly  weighted continuum image was 0.18mjy / beam .",
    "figure  1 shows the distribution of 1667mhz oh maser emission in the nucleus of 35 .",
    "we detected emission in two clumps , with a projected separation of 90mas ( 50pc ) along an axis with a position angle of @xmath29 .",
    "the spectral peak of the maser emission is in the southern clump .",
    "figure  2 shows expanded views of the northern and southern clumps .",
    "the positions of the 1665mhz line peaks are also plotted . in the single ",
    "channel images , the maser features were unresolved ; we place an upper limit of 17mas on their angular sizes , which implies a peak brightness temperature @xmath30k .",
    "figure  3 compares the imaged flux density in both clumps with the single  dish spectrum of staveley ",
    "smith  ( 1987 ) . note that @xmath31 of the total maser flux density was resolved in our vlba images .",
    "sensitivity limitations did not permit us to image the full range of blueshifted emission , which extends @xmath32  from the systemic velocity at a level of less than 10mjy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the northern clump has a projected extent of @xmath33pc ( figure  2a ) .",
    "it consists of multiple spectral features , over a velocity range of @xmath34  ( figure  3 ) .",
    "we observed an east  to  west velocity gradient of 11pcover @xmath35pc in the velocity range @xmath36   ( figure  1 , _ inset _ ) .",
    "between 8230 and 8290 , we did not detect a gradient ; all of the emission in this range lies in a compact ( @xmath37pc ) cluster at the se end of the clump ( figure  2a ) . a recent high ",
    "resolution intercontinental vlbi observation revealed a north  south gradient in this cluster of @xmath38pc  ( p. diamond , private communication ) .",
    "lower sensitivity and angular resolution prevented us from detecting a gradient of this magnitude .",
    "the brightest emission is in the southern clump .",
    "the imaged line profile is well fit by a gaussian function with a peak of 130mjy at 8245  and a fwhm of 30 , with line wings extending @xmath39  from the peak at a level of @xmath40mjy .",
    "most of the emission in the southern clump is confined to a region approximately 3pc across ( figure  2b ) ; however , emission in the line wings extends @xmath35pc se and nw of the maser peak .",
    "evidence for a velocity gradient is ambiguous within the compact part of the southern clump , but emission from the line wings suggests a velocity gradient of about 10pc , increasing along a position angle of @xmath41 .",
    "this gradient is of roughly the same magnitude as that in the northern clump , but in the opposite direction ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we imaged 1665mhz maser emission in both the northern and southern clumps .",
    "the southern clump has two spectral peaks , at 8232 and 8258 , both with flux densities of @xmath33mjy .",
    "these two peaks straddle the 1667mhz peak in doppler velocity ( figure  3 ) . both of the southern 1665mhz features are coincident with the compact component of the 1667mhz clump within the position errors ( figure  2b ) . in the northern clump",
    ", we detected one 1665mhz feature , also with a peak flux density of @xmath33mjy .",
    "the velocity of this feature is 8353 , which is near the red edge of the 1667mhz profile .",
    "moreover , while the velocity of the 1667mhz emission increases to the west in the northern clump , this 1665mhz feature lies at its eastern end ( figure  2a ) .",
    "it appears that the two oh maser clumps differ in their relative distributions of 1667 and 1665mhz emission , both in angle and in velocity .",
    "note that the features we attribute to the 1665mhz transition could be redshifted ( @xmath42 ) 1667mhz features .",
    "dish spectra ( , @xcite ) do show faint emission filling the gap between the main 1667mhz profile and the putative 1665mhz profile .",
    "however , the near angular and doppler velocity coincidence of emission in the two profiles suggests we are detecting the 1665mhz transition in both clumps , rather than highly redshifted 1667mhz features .",
    "we did not detect any 18 cm continuum emission in the nucleus of 35 with the vlba .",
    "we imaged various subsets of the data with a variety of weighting schemes to confirm this non  detection .",
    "we place a @xmath43 upper limit on the continuum flux density of 1mjy / beam .",
    "the visibility amplitudes , averaged over the entire observation , were consistent with @xmath44mjy noise on all baselines ( 1802200 km ) .",
    "the concentration of maser emission into two compact clumps is likely a result of inhomogeneity in the distribution and excitation of oh in the inner 100pc of 35 , and not to compact structure in the background continuum .",
    "chapman  ( 1990 ) observed a @xmath14 cm continuum source with a flux density of @xmath45mjy with merlin .",
    "the non  detection of the continuum on our shortest vlba baselines places a lower limit on the angular size of a 30mjy gaussian source of 170mas , or an upper limit on the continuum brightness temperature , @xmath46k .",
    "this suggests that the 18 cm nuclear continuum structure is smooth on the angular scale of the maser clump separation .",
    "it is also possible that filamentary compact continuum sources of @xmath26mjy are being amplified by the northern and southern maser clumps .",
    "however , the components of the northern clump show a clear gradient of velocity with position , suggesting that they sample a coherent , possibly rotating , region of molecular gas ( figure  1 , _ inset _ ) .",
    "50% of the total maser flux density was resolved in our vlba images ( figure  3 ) , which may indicate an extended halo component of maser emission .",
    "smoothly distributed molecular gas could act as a low  gain amplifier of an extended continuum source .",
    "alternatively , there may exist a population of compact maser clumps , each with a flux density below our detection limit .    if the velocity gradient of 11pc  that we observe over 5pc in the northern clump ( figure  1 ; _ inset _ ) is due to rotation of a homogeneous , gravitationally bound cloud , the implied mass density is @xmath1pc@xmath2 ( total enclosed mass @xmath3 ) .",
    "the gradient suggested in the line wings of the southern clump could be produced by rotation of a cloud of similar density .",
    "a difficulty in interpreting gradients in spectral images arises when two or more distinct components are close in angle ( less than a beamwidth ) and velocity ( less than a linewidth ) .",
    "blending of the individual components can simulate a smooth velocity gradient in an extended feature .",
    "the merlin observations of @xcite had a beamwidth of 280mas and a channel spacing of 14 ; at this resolution , spectral blending between the two distinct maser clumps appeared as a gradient .",
    "true gradients can only be indentified with adequate resolution . with this caution in mind ,",
    "we note that the s  shaped structure in the northern maser clump ( figure  2a ) could be produced by four or more blended , unresolved features .",
    "even so , these features would still display a correlation between velocity and position .",
    "baan , haschick , & henkel ( 1989 ) noted that the apparent luminosity of extragalactic oh masers scales approximately as @xmath47 .",
    "they interpret this correlation to imply that pumping by nuclear fir radiation produces a column density of inverted oh that is proportional to @xmath48 , which then acts as a low  gain amplifier of the 18 cm radio continuum , itself proportional to @xmath48 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the apparent optical depth estimated for the oh maser in 35 , @xmath49 , was based on the assumption that the maser completely covers the background continuum ( @xcite ) .",
    "our observation indicates that the true covering factor is significantly less than unity .",
    "we place an upper limit on the brightness temperature of the 18 cm background continuum , @xmath50k , and a lower limit on the peak brightness temperature of the maser , @xmath30k . assuming the maser is unsaturated , we derive a lower limit on the apparent optical depth , @xmath5 .",
    "if we assume that the maser is an unsaturated amplifier of background continuum emission , that the excitation temperatures of the 1667 and 1665mhz transitions are equal , and an lte optical depth ratio @xmath51 , then the ratio of 1667 to 1665mhz line peaks in single  dish spectra of 9:1 implies @xmath52 ( @xcite ) . however , the two transitions do not peak at exactly the same velocities , and the resulting variation in line ratios suggests @xmath53 across the emission profile .",
    "( 1995 ) compared the observed main  line and satellite  line ratios with models of extragalactic oh emission regions , and found that the oh line ratios are sensitive to a number of properties of the molecular gas , including density , dust temperature and the presence of velocity gradients .",
    "the observed range of 1667 to 1665mhz line ratios may be due to variations of these quantities within the maser clumps .",
    "our lower limit on the peak apparent optical depth , @xmath54 , is consistent with the range of optical depths implied by the mainline flux ratios .",
    "it therefore appears that low ",
    "gain models of extragalactic oh masers ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) do not apply in 35 .",
    "one possible explanation for the angular structure of this oh maser is that the clumps trace edge  on segments of molecular shocks .",
    "shocks are expected to be associated with energetic molecular outflows , such as those inferred from the blueshifted line wings in several oh maser galaxies , including 35 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the positions of oh masers in several galactic star  forming regions , _ e.g. _ , w3(oh ) ( @xcite ) , w75n ( @xcite ) and g5.890.39 ( @xcite ) , have been observed to coincide with shock fronts in molecular outflows .",
    "the abundance of oh can be significantly enhanced in a post  shock medium ( see , , @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , unlike most extragalactic oh masers , those in galactic star  forming regions typically have 1667 to 1665mhz line ratios less than one ( @xcite ) .",
    "mirabel , rodrguez , & ruiz ( 1989 ) have observed extended ( pc  scale ) , weak oh maser emission in a number of star ",
    "forming regions that exhibits line ratios closer to those seen in extragalactic masers , and suggest that the two phenomena may be related ; if so , then a shock origin for the observed maser structure would appear less likely .",
    "detailed modelling ( @xcite ) also suggests that the brightest extragalactic oh masers may arise in pc  scale clouds with h@xmath55 densities on the order of @xmath56cm@xmath2 .",
    "we note that images of oh absorption toward the center of our galaxy ( @xcite ) reveal a number of `` wideline clouds '' that exhibit velocity widths in excess of 100 , and intrinsic velocity gradients .",
    "however , the typical size of these clouds is rather larger ( @xmath58pc ) , and their velocity gradients at least an order of magnitude smaller , than in the maser clumps in 35 .",
    "although the continuous structure inferred by montgomery & cohen ( 1992 ) was probably a result of spectral blending , it is still possible that the two maser clumps lie in a rotating disk .",
    "we can not rule out the presence of emission in the region between the two clumps , given that 50% of the total maser flux density was resolved .",
    "the velocity separation of the maser peaks could be indicative of rotation about a central mass of @xmath59 .",
    "a difficulty with this model is that the line profiles of the two clumps overlap in velocity by more than 50 , which would imply superimposed non  rotational velocities comparable to the disk rotational velocity .",
    "furthermore , the velocity gradients we observe are more than an order of magnitude greater than what we would expect from differential rotation alone .",
    "more elaborate models , such as a warped disk , or emission on the surface of a thick torus , can not be ruled out by this observation , but are difficult to quantify .",
    "it is possible , despite the similar angular and velocity structure of the clumps , that they are physically unconnected structures , , counter  rotating , gravitationally bound molecular clouds , or shocks associated with a molecular outflow .",
    "we have used the vlba to image the oh maser in the nucleus of 35 .",
    "we detect maser emission in two clumps , with a projected separation of 50pc along a position angle of @xmath29 .",
    "the northern clump is extended , and exhibits a west  to  east projected velocity gradient of @xmath60pc .",
    "the brightest maser emission arises in the southern clump , which is mostly compact ( @xmath61pc ) ; however , faint emission from the line wings suggests a velocity gradient of similar magnitude to that in the northern clump , but in the opposite direction .",
    "we detected no 18 cm continuum emission in the nucleus , which places a lower limit on the apparent maser optical depth , @xmath5 , assuming the maser is unsaturated and is amplifying continuum radiation .",
    "this is the highest apparent gain yet determined for an extragalactic oh maser",
    ". the observed flux ratios of the 1667 to 1665mhz oh maser lines are consistent with optical depths of this magnitude or greater",
    ". variations of the line ratio with angular position and velocity suggest that physical conditions are not uniform within the maser clumps .",
    "we did not find evidence for a 100pc rotating , edge  on molecular structure , as reported by montgomery & cohen ( 1992 ) ; however , since 50% of the total maser flux was resolved , there is likely an extended or clumpy component of maser emission in 35 that does not appear in our images .",
    "velocity gradients within the clumps may indicate rotation on smaller scales ( 310pc ) .",
    "the observed gradients could be produced by two counter  rotating , gravitationally bound molecular clouds , each with an average density of roughly @xmath62pc@xmath2 .",
    "alternatively , the maser clumps could be segments of molecular shocks viewed edge  on ."
