    "the dirac - weyl 2d electron system ( dw-2des ) is nominally `` half - filled '' , with the @xmath9 band unoccupied , ( see fig .  [ figcones ] ) and has spin and valley degeneracies , with a berry phase associated with the valley index@xcite .",
    "the above picture assumes a perfect 2-d sheet of c atoms in a honeycomb lattice held in place by the @xmath11-bonding structure of the c framework . in practice , since defects are favoured by the entropy term in the free energy , some carbon atoms may be missing , forming vacancies ; they may also be substituted with other defect atoms .",
    "the surface itself may be covered with adsorbed gases .",
    "hence the nature of the density of states ( dos ) near the fermi energy in systems with vacancies and substituted atoms needs to be considered@xcite . removing a carbon atom effectively removes four valance electrons from the system , and the resulting vacancy may or may not lead to a magnetic , conducting or insulating ground state . replacing a c atom by , say",
    ", a nitrogen atom provides five valance electrons .",
    "we find that at typical concentrations of 3% or more , the dirac - weyl picture fails , and the fermi energy moves into a bandgap or to regions with a high density of states .",
    "however , if less extreme situations are considered ( e.g , adsorbed gases on graphene ) , the dw picture is found to hold true .     and @xmath8 bands cross . in ( a )",

    "the vanishing of the density of states and the effective mass of the electrons in dw-2des near the fermi points implies that the strict fermi - liquid picture breaks down in perfect graphene .",
    "the dw-2des can be doped to contain carrier electrons ( in the @xmath9 band ) , or holes as well ( in the @xmath8 band ) , and provides a rich system which retains the massless - fermion character , as long as the material is not strongly modified . however , electron - electron interactions in the dw-2des may modify the @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands , lift the sublattice ( valley ) degeneracies , or stabilize spin - polarized phases ( spp ) in preference to the unpolarized state , if the doping level or the strength of the coulomb interaction could be varied .",
    "the effect of electron - electron interactions has been most extensively studied in fermi - liquid - like electron systems found in gaas / alas interfaces or si / sio@xmath18-inversion layers .",
    "the spp in such gaas / alas - based 2des , predicted to appear at low coupling ( @xmath19 ) if perturbation methods are used , get pushed to high coupling ( @xmath20 ) if non - perturbative theory ( npt ) were used@xcite .",
    "the two - valley 2des does _ not _ show a spp in npt , unlike for one - valley systems , presumably because of the preponderance of the ( three times as many ) direct coulomb interactions over the exchange interactions@xcite .",
    "the exchange and correlation energy @xmath21 in the 4-component si / sio@xmath18 electron system were calculated in ref . using the classical - map hyper - netted - chain ( chnc ) technique , accurately recovering the quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) results in every coupling regimes@xcite .",
    "chnc provides the pair - distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xmath22 as a function of the coupling strength .",
    "then @xmath21 is evaluated via a coupling constant integration , providing a fully non - local , transparent approach .",
    "the method has been successfully applied to the 2des@xcite , 3des@xcite , the 2-valley 2des in sio@xmath18 interfaces@xcite , the thick quasi-2des in higfets@xcite , and the electron - proton system@xcite .",
    "however , the full non - local treatment of exchange and correlation in graphene involves an @xmath23 matrix of two - component pdfs because of the spin , and valley indices as well as the presence of @xmath24 bands .",
    "hence in this study we first consider the exchange energies via an analytic evaluation of the non - interacting pdfs .",
    "the correlation energies are estimated by appealing to our results for the spin - polarized four - component two - valley 2-d electron system ( 2v-2des ) of si - mosfets .",
    "the non - interacting pdfs of the dw-2des , @xmath25 involve two components , the first being a bessel function as in the ordinary 2des , while a second , associated with the cosine of the angle of e - e scattering , involves products of bessel and struve functions .",
    "the exchange energy enhancement of the sipn - polarized phase nearly cancels the kinetic energy enhancement , implying that the correlation energy plays the dominant residual role .",
    "we find that while there are stable spps in an exchange - only approach , including the correlation energy using the 2v-2des data stabilizes the graphene-2des in the unpolarized state .",
    "this conclusion is not surprising since the coulomb coupling strength in graphene is @xmath0 2 - 3 , and no ssps are found in electron liquids at such low coupling , except as artifacts of low - order theories .    in the following section we present first - principles calculations for pure graphene , graphene with @xmath0 3% , and @xmath0 12 % vacancy concentrations , and",
    "show that the dw - model is inapplicable to such systems .",
    "we also consider systems with n - substitution as the lattice distortion effects are smaller here .",
    "nevertheless , even here the dw - model does not seem to be applicable .",
    "however , if we consider a graphene layer having a metastable sheath of n@xmath18 molecules adsorbed on it , with no disruption of the @xmath11-bonding network , the dw - model does remain applicable .",
    "thus , having established the limits of the dw - model , we proceed to examine the exchange and correlation effects among dw - fermions , and show that a stable spin phase transition is found only in `` exchange only '' models which neglect electron correlation effects .",
    "simple tight - binding models(tbm ) can be trusted only if they are validated by more detailed calculations and experiments . while tbm can be successfully exploited within a limited energy window for pure graphene , the effect of vacancies and lattice substituants etc .",
    ", needs detailed consideration .",
    "a vacancy removes 4 valence electrons , distorts the bond lengths and angles around the vacancy , creating pentagonal networks and compensating larger networks , localizing electrons near the vacancy and changing the structure of the electronic density of states ( dos ) .",
    "the bond - lengths and the network structure is better preserved with n substitution . here an extra electron is added to the graphene system for every n substitution . attempting to treat such effects using tight - binding methods augmented by , say , @xmath26-matrix theory etc . , to account for impurity effects are well known to be strongly model dependent . nevertheless , some insight has already been gained from short - ranged scatterer models where lattice relaxation and other very important issues are not handled@xcite however , density - functional theory ( dft ) has an excellent track record in just such problems where electronic and ionic energy minimization can be carried out until the hellman - feynman forces on atoms around the vacancy or the substituant are reduced to zero .",
    "there are a number of such dft calculations already in the literature@xcite , mainly concerned with energetics and bonding . here",
    "we examine the bands and dos of these systems , with an eye on the limits of validity of the dw-2des model .",
    "we have used the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp)@xcite which implements a spin - density functional periodic plane - wave basis calculation .",
    "the projected augmented wave ( paw ) pseudopotentials@xcite have been used for c and n. the c pseudopotential has already been used in several graphene - type calculations ( e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "the n pseudopotential was also further tested by a study of the n@xmath18 dimer where an equilibrium bond distance of 1.11 angstroms was obtained , in good agreement with other dft calculations as well as results from detailed configuration interaction studies etc.@xcite , where a value of 1.095 @xmath27 is reached .",
    "the @xmath0 3% and @xmath0 12% vacancy calculations were done with 32-atom and 8-atom graphene - like unit cells .",
    "these systems are thus _ not _ truly disordered , but provide reference densities of states which acquire smearing when some disorder is introduced by sampling other configurations using larger simulation cells@xcite .",
    "when vacancies are introduced into graphene , the large stresses are relieved by the neighbours ( c - atoms near the vacancy ) moving towards the vacancy .",
    "the distortion persists to at least the third neighbours , and generates a bond - length distribution varying from about 1.398@xmath28 to 1.45 .@xmath27 if the vacancies are replaced by n substitution , the structural distortions are smaller but the changes in the dos can be equally drastic , as we show below .",
    "yuchen ma et al.@xcite have found that n@xmath18 molecules may form a metastable layer near carbon nanotubes and graphene .",
    "iyakutti et al@xcite have also found similar stabilization , where the n@xmath18 layer is less stable than if it were at infinity , but held in place by an energy barrier .",
    "although this is a weakly adsorbed state , the interaction energy between the graphene layer and the n@xmath18 layer is about as strong as between two graphene sheets .",
    "hence we have looked at the band - structure and dos of such a fully n@xmath18 covered graphene sheet as well . here",
    "the dirac - weyl behaviour is preserved . in fig .",
    "[ c2n2b ] we show the band structure of pure graphene ( top panel ) , and also a graphene sheet with a layer of n@xmath18 molecules , with each n@xmath18 aligned on every kkul - bond position ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the sheet of n@xmath18 molecules is positioned about 3@xmath27 above the graphene sheet .",
    "the interaction energy per carbon ( or per n ) is about 0.2 ev . the regime of d - w linear dispersion around the * k * point is reduced from that of pure graphene .",
    "this is in contrast to the interaction between two graphene sheets , where the bands near the * k*-point become parabolic@xcite .",

    "the fermi energy is at e@xmath29=0 .",
    "conduction bands are shown in red .",
    "the bands obtained from a standard @xmath30 tight - binding scheme are compared with the dft bands for graphene in the top panel . , width=302,height=396 ]    however , when vacancies or n atoms are introduced into the graphene network at relatively significant concentrations ( e.g. , 3%-12 % ) , the dos modifies and shifts to produce a large density of states near the fermi energy @xmath10 .",
    "this is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "the calculation is for an ordered system with 1/8 or 1/32 alloying of vacancies or n , and may be used as reference points for a consideration of a disordered system .",
    "the calculations used exchange - correlation functionals based on the ceperley - alder type@xcite , and no spin polarized states are expected for a conductive system with an enhance dos , as seen in the figure . on the other hand , the existence of such an enhanced dos near @xmath10 in graphene with 12% vacancies ,",
    "would be of importance to possible superconductivity of these systems .",
    "the electronic density of states for a lower density vacancy system , i.e. , with one vacancy per 32 carbon atoms , is shown in the lower panel . here",
    "the system _ acquires a gap _ near @xmath10 , and the material is an insulator . if the vacancy concentration is further decreased , we expect the energy gap to slowly decrease and recover the dirac - weyl model in the limit of pure graphene .",
    "but , as seen from the dos at 12% vacancies , we see that as the vacancy concentration is increased from 3% , the energy gap closes and @xmath10 positions to a high - dos region .",
    "meanwhile , an energy gap opens about 1 ev below the fermi energy .",
    "thus we see that a _",
    "vacancy induced metal - insulator transition _ is possible ( see however , ref .  ) .",
    "this picture becomes considerably less sharp if the vacancies are not considered to form a periodic array . in any case",
    ", our conclusion that the dirac - weyl model is inapplicable even at 3% vacancy concentrations probably remains valid . the observations of the quantum hall effect and other signatures of the dw model clearly indicate that good low - vacancy regions of graphene foils are the subject of these experiments .",
    "another aspect of low - density vacancies or substituents in graphene is the issue of spin - polarized ground states .",
    "the reported results depend on the size and edge structure of finite sheet fragments@xcite , or the possibility of further c - adatom adsorption on n - substituted sites@xcite .",
    "the calculations are sensitive to the treatment of exchange and correlation , as in first - principles theories of magnetism in transition - metal oxides .",
    "hence a reliable discussion of magnetism in graphene - like systems would require an assessment of coulomb interactions in dirac - weyl electrons .",

    "a full evaluation of the 4-component jellium 2des from the interacting pdfs has been carried out and the correlation energy is given in parametrized form in eq .  5 of ref .  .",
    "in transferring from the 2v-2des to the dw-2des we note that @xmath51 which is unity in 2v-2des becomes @xmath152 in the dw-2des .",
    "the correlation energy enhancement is : @xmath153 the correlation energies in jellium-2des are evaluated from pdfs whose non - interacting forms are bessel - type pdfs , where as the dw-2des contain only about 1/2 the number of bessel - type pdfs , while the other are struve - type pdfs which bringing in a minor contribution",
    ". thus an upper bound would be to use the estimate of @xmath154 given above , while a lower - bound would be about 1/2 the above estimate .",
    "the @xmath155 calculated from the jellium 4-component system using the above scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ jelcorr ] .",
    "the total energy difference inclusive of the kinetic energy , @xmath75 , and the estimated @xmath76 , between the polarized and unpolarized phases is shown in in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ jelcorr ] .",
    "sice the kinetic - energy enhancement of the polarized phase is compensated by the exchange enhancement , the total energy enhancement is determined by the correlation effects .",
    "thus we see that the inclusion of the correlation energy suppresses the spin - polarized phase found in the exchange - only calculation .    in this work",
    "we have kept the coulomb coupling fixed at @xmath49 typical of graphene , unlike in other studies@xcite where the coupling strength @xmath156 is taken as a tunable parameter , in the spirit of hubbard - model studies . if dielectric screening is taken into account@xcite , the coupling is reduced and many - body effects become smaller .",
    "we do not see a practical experimental scheme for increasing the value of the coulomb coupling strength @xmath48 beyond 2.7 in the graphene system .    even in the one - valley 2des ,",
    "the spp of low - order theories is pushed to @xmath157 . in the 2v-2des ,",
    "direct terms predominate over exchange interactions , and the spp is not found in chnc@xcite or qmc@xcite calculations .",
    "we see that the inclusion of correlations within a reasonable scheme suppresses the exchange - driven spp in the graphene-2des as well .",
