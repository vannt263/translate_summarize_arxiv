    "`` water fountain '' stars ( wfs ) are evolved objects that show high - velocity water masers , with at least some maser components tracing collimated jets ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) . the velocity spread in their water maser spectra is typically @xmath1 km s@xmath0 , and can be as large as @xmath2 km s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these spectra indicate the presence of motions with velocities much higher than those of the expanding circumstellar envelopes of objects in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , which are estimated to be @xmath3 km s@xmath0 , based on the velocity separation between the the components in double - peaked oh maser spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "wfs are in the short transition phase between the agb and the planetary nebula ( pn ) stage of low- to intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath4 m@xmath5 ) .",
    "their being in this particular evolutionary stage , together with the short dynamical timescales of the maser jets ( 5 - 100 yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their relatively strong optical obscuration @xcite indicate that wfs may represent one of the first manifestations of collimated mass - loss in evolved stars . therefore , they are key objects to understand when and how the spherical symmetry seen in agb stars and earlier stages is broken to give rise to the spectacular variety of morphologies displayed in the pn phase .    only around 15 sources have been identified so far as possible wfs @xcite . of these , 13 have been confirmed with interferometric observations .",
    "the rest have been identified as candidate wfs with single - dish spectra . a usual criterion to identify the possible presence of high - velocity gas in these cases",
    "is the detection of water maser emission outside the velocity range of oh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , considered to trace the expansion of the circumstellar envelope . this criterion is useful even in the cases where the jet traced by the water maser emission moves close to the plane of the sky and thus , the measured spread of radial velocities of water masers are modest ( @xmath6 km s@xmath0 ) .",
    "however , given the relatively low angular resolution of single - dish observations , it is impossible to ascertain whether the multiple water maser peaks , spread over large velocities , actually arise from the same source or they are the superposition of emission from close , but different sources .",
    "interferometric observations , with a high positional accuracy , are necessary to ascertain that all maser components are associated with the same evolved object .",
    "the confirmation of new objects as wfs is important , given the scarcity of members of this class .",
    "this small number of members may indicate either that the wf phase is short , and/or that only a small fraction of stars become wfs . increasing the database of this type of objects may help us to understand unsolved questions , such as whether most low and intermediate - mass stars go through a wf phase .",
    "moreover , monitoring of the identified objects would give us clues as to whether wf characteristics occur during a very limited time in stellar evolution , or whether they are recurrent episodes along a longer period of time .",
    "in this paper we present interferometric water maser observations toward four sources that are considered to be wf candidates , given the presence of high - velocity water maser emission in single - dish spectra , but for which no interferometric confirmation was yet available .",
    "our observations were carried out on 2014 september 28 with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in its h214 configuration , under the observational project c2954 .",
    "we used the compact array broadband backend ( cabb ) correlator @xcite in its cfb 1m-0.5k mode , which provides , in each of the two available intermediate frequency bands ( ifs ) , a broad bandwidth of 2 ghz sampled over 2048 channels of 1-mhz width , plus up to 16 spectral zooms to study spectral lines with a resolution of 0.5 khz . in the case of our l",
    "/ s - band observations , we centered the 2 ghz broad band of cabb at 2100 mhz for both ifs ( thus providing redundant data ) , and twelve of the broadband channels ( four groups of 3 channels ) were zoomed in to observe spectral lines . with this setup",
    ", we observed the oh ground - level transitions of rest frequencies 1612.2309 , 1665.4018 , 1667.3590 , and 1720.5299 mhz , with an effective frequency range of 2 mhz each , sampled over 4096 channels of 0.5 khz ( total velocity coverage and resolution of 381 and 0.09 km s@xmath0 at 1612 mhz , respectively ) . for our k - band observations ,",
    "the two ifs were centered at 20000 and 22000 mhz .",
    "we combined 16 zoomed - in broadband channels to observe the @xmath7 transition of the h@xmath8o molecule ( rest frequency 22235.08 mhz ) , providing a total velocity coverage and resolution of 114 and @xmath9 km s@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "these h@xmath8o - maser data were hanning - smoothed , up to a velocity resolution of 0.066 km s@xmath0 .",
    "source pks 1934 - 683 was used to set the absolute flux scale at all frequencies , whereas the spectral response of the instrument was calibrated with sources pks 1934 - 638 and 3c 279 at l / s and k bands , respectively .",
    "a summary of other observational parameters is given in table [ tab : obs ] .",
    "note that the source iras 19067 + 0811 was not observed at l / s band .",
    "the velocities in this paper are given with respect to the kinematic definition of the local standard of rest ( lsrk ) .",
    "oh emission at 1612 mhz from iras 15514 - 5323 ( oh 328.225 + 0.042 ) , iras 15535 - 5328 ( oh 328.4 - 0.2 ) , and iras 15552 - 5316 ( oh 328.7 - 0.2 ) has been reported before ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although our data have a higher spectral resolution .",
    "the emission at these frequencies seems to arise from several individual sources .",
    "however , their relative distances are smaller than the size of the synthesized beam in our images , so it is impossible to obtain a spectrum for each of the individual sources . however , the relative positional accuracy of each individual spectral feature is enough to discriminate their positions .",
    "[ fig : spec_i15oh1665 ] shows the spectra at 1665 and 1667 mhz . both spectra represent the combined emission from the different sources within the synthesized beam .",
    "the emission at these frequencies was better resolved by @xcite using a more extended atca configuration .",
    "it corresponds to sources 328.237 - 0.547 and 328.254 - 0.532 in that paper , and it could be associated with mid - infrared sources 49 , 50 , and 51 in @xcite .",
    "these are sites of methanol maser emission @xcite and therefore , they are likely to be high - mass star - forming regions ."
