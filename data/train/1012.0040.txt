    "<S> approach for the fabrication of these nanostructures uses nanoparticles as elementary building blocks . under some specific conditions </S>",
    "<S> the nanoparticles self - organize into the desired structures @xcite . a well - known and widely explored possibility to induce </S>",
    "<S> this self - organization is to use the capillarity forces which appear during the drying of a liquid suspension of nanoparticles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , regular and irregular two - dimensional polystyrene nanosphere arrays on silica substrates are generated by such methods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these patterns are used then as a convenient mask in the nanosphere litography ( nsl ) method .    </S>",
    "<S> carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) are attractive materials for nanotechnology because of their interesting physico - chemical properties and molecular symmetries . in order to make them appropriate for certain applications , </S>",
    "<S> proper initial cnt configurations have to be built , and specific conditions have to be found which enable their controlled self - organization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a very ambitious and challenging task , which can be made easier by elaborating working computer models for the self - organization of cnts on substrates . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , not only experimental , but also computational studies can advance the field of nanoengineering .    in the work of chakrapani et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite an experimental procedure is presented in which capillary self - organization of cnts leads to puzzling cellular patterns . after the collapse and reassembly of the highly ordered , anisotropic , elastic cnts , shrinkage and crack formation occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting cellular foams are visually striking , stable patterns .    , width=283 ]    the experimental procedure @xcite may be shortly summarized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> multi - walled nanotube arrays are grown on rigid silica surface by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) based on the decomposition of ferrocene and xylene . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting nanotubes have a wall thickness of ca . </S>",

    "<S> 30 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the average distance between two nanotubes is ca . </S>",
    "<S> 50 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained nanotube bristle is oxidized in an oxygen plasma at room temperature and 133 pa pressure for 10 minutes and immersed in a wetting fluid . </S>",
    "<S> after the liquid evaporates , characteristic cellular type patterns are formed , i.e. the ends of nanotubes self - organize in compact walls .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig1 ] . shows scanning electron microscope images of some typical structures . from the figures we learn that a wide variety of structures are engineered in such manner . </S>",
    "<S> both statistically symmetric polygonal cells and rather elongated ones can be obtained by chaning the experimental conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> these micrometer scale structures have many advantageous features . </S>",
    "<S> they can be elastically deformed , transferred to other substrates or floated out to produce free - standing macroscopic fabrics . </S>",
    "<S> thus , they might find potential applications as shock absorbent reinforcement in nanofiltration devices , elastic membranes and fabrics , and containers for storage or growth of biological cells .    </S>",
    "<S> despite of its applications and the existence of well elaborated production protocols , the exact mechanisms responsible for self - organization of cnts into vertically aligned cellular structures is not clearly understood . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been argued that although we lack some basic information regarding the self - organization of cnts within a bristle , this process can be approximated with the self - organization of arrays of cnt micropillars of micron - scale diameters @xcite each consisting of thousands of cnts . </S>",
    "<S> this observation enables the construction of a computationally tractable model which operates instead of stand - alone cnts with micropillars .    in the present work a simple mechanical spring - block type model defined at mesoscopic micropillar level is considered for understanding the capillarity driven self - organization of nanobristles ( or so called `` cnt forests '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> the aim is to build a model that is able to qualitatively reproduce the variety of experimentally produced patterns .    </S>",
    "<S> the model used here for describing the self - organization process of nanobristles is a mesoscopic one and is based on the mechanical spring - block stick - slip model family . </S>",
    "<S> this model family appeared in 1967 , when r. burridge and l. knopoff @xcite constructed a simple mechanical model for explaining the guttenberg - richter law for the distribution of earthquakes after their magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the basic elements of the model are blocks and springs that interconnect in a lattice - like topology . </S>",
    "<S> the blocks can slide with friction on a planar surface . </S>",
    "<S> the original system introduced by burridge and knopoff ( bk ) is a one - dimensional model . </S>",
    "<S> it can be studied numerically and it exhibits self - organized criticality @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the bk model gained new perspectives with the strong development of computers and computer simulation methods . </S>",
    "<S> variants of the bk model proved to be useful in describing complex phenomena where avalanche - like processes are present , pattern formation phenomena and mesoscopic processes in solid - state physics or material sciences @xcite .    recently , by using this model , we have succesfully explained the patterns obtained in capillary self - organization of nanospheres @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this success , hereby we propose to map the capillarity driven self - organization of nanotube bristles to a spring - block system , and to understand the pattern selection process by means of computer simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> , width=283 ]    first , let us consider the three - dimensional ( 3d ) model , which is very similar to the real nanotube arrangement . </S>",
    "<S> as sketched in figure [ fig2](a ) , the micropillars composed by thousands of nanotubes having fixed bottom ends are modeled by flexible strands . </S>",
    "<S> their capillary interactions are represented by non - classical springs that connect the neighboring pillars . </S>",
    "<S> the evaporation of the liquid is simulated by the stepwise increase of tension in the springs . </S>",
    "<S> this will result in the agglomeration of micropillar ends creating the final structure in the studied system .    as shown in figure [ fig2](b ) , this 3d model can be easily mapped into a two - dimensional ( 2d ) one by projecting the micropillars top ends on the surface . in the projection plane </S>",
    "<S> the micropillars bottom ends are represented as dots , and their positions are fixed on a predefined lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the movable top ends are modeled by the disk shaped blocks which can slide with friction on the 2d simulation surface . for visual purposes only , each block is connected by an extensible string with its bottom end showing the micropillars trunk . in our simplest approach there is no restriction imposed to the length of these extensible strings which means that nanotubes with infinite length are used . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the real case when the nanotubes length is much grater than the linear size of the cells in the final patterns . </S>",
    "<S> the blocks ( top of micropillars ) are connected with their nearest neighbors through special springs that model the resulting forces acting between the micropillars .        </S>",
    "<S> .[fig3 ]    these special springs are one key ingredient of our computational model . </S>",
    "<S> they represent the resultant interaction force acting between two micropillars immersed in suspension . </S>",
    "<S> the tension force in the spring has a complex variation with the spring - length , it s form is sketched with a red line in the top panel of figure [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this force is the resultant of the capillary force , the electrostatic repulsion and the van der waals attraction between the micropillars . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the capillary force acting between two micro - scale rods wetted by a liquid was measured experimentally and deduced analytically , too @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> electrostatic repulsion and van der waals attraction are successfully described by the derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the capillary force decays inversely proportionally with distance @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant of all these forces reduces to zero for long distances and it has a maximum @xmath1 at distance @xmath2 of micropillars .    </S>",
    "<S> our model approximates this resulting force . the special spring - force used in simulations </S>",
    "<S> is shown with solid line in the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ] . for small elongations </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 this spring acts as a classical spring with @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the spring constant and @xmath6 is its equilibrium length . for elongations </S>",
    "<S> longer than @xmath2 the spring force decays as @xmath7 where the constant @xmath8 is selected in such way that the force - elongation curve is continuous at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of the spring force at @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly with our previous models of drying granular materials @xcite or self - organizing nanosphere systems @xcite , the effects created by the evaporation of the liquid is introduced through these springs . as the liquid evaporates the meniscus accounting for the capillarity forces gets more accentuated . </S>",
    "<S> this is modeled by a step - by - step increasing of the spring constant @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it has to be noted that through the drying process the maximum force in the spring @xmath1 remains unchanged since the electrostatic forces are not affected . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , with the increasing of @xmath5 the @xmath2 value has to be proportionally lowered .    </S>",
    "<S> the second key ingredient of our spring - block model ( necessary to get realistic structures ) is the capillary force resulting from the non - vertical orientation of micropillars . </S>",
    "<S> once the micropillar becomes inclined , the meniscus radius of the liquid surface in contact with the micropillar becomes grater on the top side than on the bottom side . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an unstable state because a resulting net force @xmath9 pointing vertically downwards will act at the crossing point between the liquid surface and the micropillar @xcite , tending to incline even more the tube . here </S>",
    "<S> we denoted by @xmath10 the angle between the vertical and the tangent to the micropillar at the liquid level .    in our spring - block approach this force which is monotonically increasing with the inclination angle </S>",
    "<S> is approximated by a simple linear repulsion force @xmath11 acting between the block and its fixed bottom end ( @xmath12 denotes their distance in the simulation plane and @xmath13 is the repulsion constant ) .    </S>",
    "<S> there is an additional almost hard - core  type repulsion @xmath14 which forbids blocks to interpenetrate . </S>",
    "<S> this is taken into account by the repulsive part of a lennard  jones type force which acts only when the distance between two blocks becomes smaller than @xmath6 ( dashed line on the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> additionally to the presented forces , damping forces are considered to stabilize the dynamics . a friction ( pinning ) between blocks and surface </S>",
    "<S> is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> it can equilibrate a net force less than @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> whenever the total force acting on a block exceeds @xmath15 , the block slips with an over - damped motion .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics leading to pattern formation consists of the following relaxation steps . </S>",
    "<S> first , the system is initialized . </S>",
    "<S> blocks are placed on a triangular lattice with lattice constant @xmath16 and their corresponding bottom ends are fixed at the same positions . then , the blocks are slightly dislodged in a random direction with a small random shift not grater than the half of the empty space between blocks . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , the initial imperfectness of the nanobristle is modeled . </S>",
    "<S> next , the interconnecting spring - network is build . </S>",
    "<S> the spring constant @xmath5 is selected in such way that in the initial system the spring forces are not exceeding the pinning force @xmath15 that acts on each block . </S>",
    "<S> an initially prestressed spring - block network is thus constructed .    during each simulation </S>",
    "<S> step the spring constant is increased by a small amount @xmath17 representing the increase of tension due to the evaporation of water and the system relaxes to an equilibrium configuration . in this configuration the total net force acting on each disk is lower in magnitude than the pinning threshold @xmath15 .    similarly with the modelling of drying nanosphere suspensions @xcite , the relaxation dynamics </S>",
    "<S> is realized through an over - damped molecular dynamics simulation using a fixed time - step . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium state in a viscous medium can be found by moving the blocks in each simulation step in the direction of the net force acting on them , and with a displacement which is proportional to the magnitude of the resultant force @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes a viscosity .    since </S>",
    "<S> the simulation steps will be chosen small enough , this simplified dynamics is able to replace the newtonian solution without loss of significant information . </S>",
    "<S> we remind here that we are not interested in the dynamics , but in the final equilibrium configuration . </S>",
    "<S> a relaxation step is finished when no disk slipping event occurs for the given spring constant value . </S>",
    "<S> it usually takes a very long time to achieve a perfect relaxation , therefore we introduce a tolerance ( @xmath20@xmath21 ) , and assume that the relaxation is completed when the largest displacement per unit time is smaller than this value . </S>",
    "<S> after relaxation is done , we proceed to the next simulation step and increase all spring constants by @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this dynamics is repeated until a final , stable configuration of the blocks is reached .    </S>",
    "<S> when implementing the above relaxation dynamics , several types of boundary conditions can be considered . however , as it was shown in @xcite the boundary conditions ( free , fixed or periodic ) will influence the final stable structure only in the vicinity of boundaries . in the bulk , </S>",
    "<S> the obtained structures are rather independent of this choice . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , in the present simulations fixed boundary conditions are used and snapshots from the bulk are taken for later investigations .    the above presented model has many parameters . here , their values for our present simulations are given . </S>",
    "<S> the disk shaped blocks are considered with radii @xmath22 , and it defines the unit length in the system . after fixing the diameter of the circular simulation area @xmath23 , </S>",
    "<S> the blocks are placed on the triangular lattice having a lattice constant @xmath24 . the density ( or space filling ) of micropillars is implicitly defined by this lattice constant . </S>",
    "<S> the block sliding dynamics is governed by the viscosity @xmath25 used in the equation ( [ overdamped ] ) and the pinning threshold @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the springs used in simulations are characterized by two parameters , namely the initial spring constant @xmath27 and the equilibrium distance of springs @xmath6 . by these parameters </S>",
    "<S> the unit force in our model system is defined . in order to simulate a quasi - static drying process the spring constant increasing step </S>",
    "<S> has to be a small one @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the central capillary repulsion constant @xmath29 is set to be small enough that in the initial system , where the micropillars are almost vertical , not to affect the cell formation dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> later , when the walls are forming ( and the micropillars are no longer vertically aligned ) , this force becomes grater and it helps the wall formation and stabilization process . </S>",
    "<S> the used lennard  </S>",
    "<S> jones force has its standard parameters set to @xmath30 and @xmath31 expressed in simulation units . </S>",
    "<S> all results presented in the following are obtained with the above choosed parameter values , unless it is otherwise specified in figure captions .    , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 and @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation time step @xmath34 is noted below the snapshots.[fig4],width=283 ]    the presented algorithm can be easily implemented and systems up to 300000 nanotubes can be simulated in reasonable computational time . as observable from the time - sequence in figure [ fig4 ] , </S>",
    "<S> the cellular patterns are formed after nucleation of voids in the spring - block network ( time step @xmath35 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a preliminary void is enlarged by the tensioned springs ( time step @xmath36 ) until the top of micropillars arrange in a final and stable cellular structure ( time step @xmath37 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained dynamics resembles the pattern formation mechanism known from experimental in - situ observations @xcite .     and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice constant is @xmath39 for the top left panel , @xmath40 for the top right panel and @xmath41 for the bottom left panel . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained structures are magnified on the bottom right panel.[fig5],width=283 ]    furthermore , the effect of nanotube density on final patterns is computationally investigated . </S>",
    "<S> simulations with the same parameter set are preformed for systems initialized with different lattice constants @xmath16 . by this , the space filling of the micropillar system @xmath42 is varied . here </S>",
    "<S> , it has to be noted that the micropillar density and implicitly the micropillar lattice constant are linearly connected to the real nanotube density @xmath43 and the nanotube lattice constant @xmath44 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> if a micropillar is composed by @xmath34 nanotubes , then by simple geometrical calculations it can be shown that @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the radius of a nanotube .    in figure [ fig5 ] three different type of simulated structures are presented . for high space filling @xmath47 corresponding to lattice constant @xmath39 polygonal cellular structures are obtained similar to those on the left hand side of figure [ fig1 ] . as one can observe on the magnified cell image , at the center there is a clean area formed by radially outgoing micropillars . for intermediate space filling @xmath48 which corresponds to a lattice constant @xmath40 the micropillars self - organize into elongated cellular structures . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained structures are in qualitative agreement with the experimental structures presented in the right hand side sem images of figure [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> when interpreting the image , one has to take into account that the length scale of this snapshot is @xmath49 times smaller than the length scale of the previously discussed one . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the typical size of the simulated elongated structures is @xmath50 times grater than the typical size of the polygonal structures . for low space filling @xmath51 corresponding to a lattice constant @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> the micropillars form bundled clusters resembling the recent experimental patterns of sequential assembly of self - similar nanotube clusters @xcite .    , </S>",
