    "many cosmological models , including ` inflation ' , predict that the large scale structure of the universe arose from the gravitational collapse of gaussian primordial fluctuations .",
    "these models have a strong physical motivation ( in inflation , the primordial perturbations are just quantum fluctuations ) , require few free parameters ( the two - point correlation function provides a complete statistical description of the field ) , and have many observable properties which can be modeled with simple physics . given these attractive features , gaussian models are a natural starting point for the investigation of structure formation .    a number of theories however , including ` defects ' ( kibble 1976 , vilenkin & shellard 1994 ) and certain exotic forms of inflation ( peebles 1983 , 1997 , 1998a , b ; la 1991 ; amendola & occhionero 1991 ; amendola & borgani 1993 ) , predict that the primordial fluctuations were not gaussian .",
    "these theories possess many of the attractive features of gaussian models : defect models , for instance , are well motivated and require few free parameters .",
    "unlike the gaussian case , however , making robust predictions in non - gaussian models is often very difficult . in defect theories , this is because the physical processes which must be modeled are complex and highly non - linear .",
    "more generally , the parameter space available to non - gaussian models is infinitely larger , because specifying the statistics of the primordial fluctuations requires not just the two - point correlation function , but all higher @xmath1-point correlation functions as well .",
    "previous studies of non - gaussian structure formation ( e.g. , weinberg & cole 1992 ; borgani et  al .",
    "1994 ; park , spergel & turok 1991 ) have tended to concentrate on specific models , making predictions for observable properties in each case . due to the infinite range of possible parameters , and the difficulties of making robust predictions",
    "even within well specified models , we turn here to a different approach : we start from a property of non - gaussian models which can be fully quantified by a small number of parameters , the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the density field over the range of scales relevant to galaxy cluster formation .",
    "while knowledge of the pdf does not fully specify the non - gaussian nature of the distribution ( which would require knowledge of all the higher @xmath1-point correlation functions ) , we show that it provides us with sufficient information to make robust predictions for a very interesting observable quantity : the redshift evolution of the cluster number abundance .",
    "we do this by demonstrating that the cluster evolution in non - gaussian n - body simulations can be accurately described by a version of the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) modified to allow for non - gaussianity ( chiu , ostriker & strauss 1997 ) , which requires only the pdf as input .",
    "the result of this work is a powerful tool with which we can use observations of galaxy clusters to constrain the primordial pdf in the universe , without reference to any specific non - gaussian models or the uncertainties which may be inherent to them .",
    "the work presented here validates a number of previous studies which have used the non - gaussian press - schechter formalism , but have not tested it ( chiu et  al .",
    "1998 , robinson , gawiser & silk 1998 , van de bruck 1998 ) .",
    "other work ( robinson , gawiser & silk in preparation ) discusses in detail the strong model - independent constraints we can place using this tool .",
    "in  [ sec - ps ] we describe the ps formalism , and we extend the derivation in the non - gaussian case to allow for a scale dependent probability distribution function . section  [ sec - nongauss ] describes our non - gaussian models and the realization of the initial density fields in each case . in  [ n - body ] we give details of our n - body simulations .",
    "finally , in  [ sec - results ] we present our results and in  [ sec - conclusions ] we discuss our conclusions .",
    "the press - schechter ( ps ) formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) is a simple semi - analytic tool for predicting the expected number density of clusters in an evolved density field , given the linear initial conditions .",
    "extensive work has shown that this formalism can give a good fit to the cluster abundance observed in n - body simulations of gaussian structure formation models .",
    "though the ps formula has mainly been applied to gaussian fluctuations , there is a straightforward way to generalize it to the non - gaussian case : here , the statistics of the underlying density field are quantified by specifying its pdf @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the probability that the primordial field at a given point in space has an overdensity between @xmath4 and @xmath5 after a top hat smoothing of scale @xmath6 .",
    "we can rewrite @xmath2 in terms of a rescaled pdf @xmath7 which has zero mean and _ rms _ one : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the _ rms _ overdensity in spheres of radius @xmath6 . for many non - gaussian models",
    "it should be a reasonable assumption that only the _ rms _ value of @xmath4 varies as a function of scale ( for instance , in defect theories where the fluctuations are layed down in a scale invariant manner ) , so that @xmath7 is in fact independent of @xmath6 .",
    "the press - schechter formula for this case has been derived by chiu et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) and used to make predictions for a number of non - gaussian scenarios ( robinson et  al . 1998 ; van de bruck 1998 ) .",
    "in this work , we rederive the formula for the more general case that the form of the pdf does depend on scale , since we will see later that the assumption of scale independence is valid for some but not all of the models we consider .",
    "the press - schechter formalism starts from the assumption that clusters with mass greater than some value @xmath10 at redshift @xmath11 form in regions of the primordial density field whose overdensity smoothed on scale @xmath12 and extrapolated using linear gravity to redshift @xmath11 is greater than some critical value @xmath13 .",
    "the scale @xmath12 is chosen to be the radius of a sphere containing mass @xmath10 in the primordial homogeneous universe , which satisfies @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the comoving matter density of the universe .",
    "the critical threshold @xmath13 is taken from an analytic solution for the collapse of a spherically symmetric overdensity , which gives @xmath16 for a critical universe ( for a derivation of the weak cosmological dependence , see lacey & cole 1993 , eke et al .",
    "1996 ) .    from this starting point",
    ", it is possible to derive the cluster mass function .",
    "the probability @xmath17 of a point in space forming part of a cluster with lagrangian radius larger than @xmath6 is equal to the probability of the density field , after smoothing on scale @xmath6 , having an overdensity larger than the critical overdensity @xmath13 .",
    "that is , @xmath18 to obtain the probability @xmath19 of a point in space forming part of a cluster with lagrangian radius between @xmath6 and @xmath20 , we differentiate the above expression with respect to @xmath6 and take the absolute value , @xmath21 we can obtain the number density of such clusters @xmath22 by dividing by the cluster lagrangian volume , @xmath23 where we have also multiplied by a correction factor @xmath24 , whose value we will fix by ensuring that final mass function accounts for the entire mass of the universe .",
    "the integrated mass function @xmath25 is then given by @xmath26 to fix the value of the correction factor @xmath24 , we use the following expression for the integrated mass density @xmath15 of the universe : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the cluster mass corresponding to lagrangian radius @xmath6 . substituting using equation",
    "[ eq - mass - r ] and  [ eq - nr ] , we find @xmath29 which does indeed give @xmath30 for gaussian fluctuations , as originally proposed by press & schechter .",
    "we comment briefly on some computational issues : we can rewrite the mass function in a convenient form using integration by parts , @xmath31 for each model and for each redshift we compute and store the function @xmath17 for a range of values of @xmath6 . each computation of @xmath25 ( eq .  [ eq - ngtm ] ) then requires only a single integration over these stored values .",
    "finally , we note that the redshift dependence of the mass function arises through the dependence of @xmath17 on redshift , which for conciseness we have not labelled explicitly here .",
    "for the purposes of this work , we consider three classes of non - gaussian model ; peebles isocurvature cold dark matter ( icdm ) model , cosmic string models , and primordial void models .",
    "these models are all physically motivated , and each one represents an interesting structure formation scenario in its own right . however , each model has a number of uncertain features . in the cases of icdm or voids",
    ", there is a wide range of possible model parameters to consider , and in the case of cosmic strings , there are extreme computational difficulties involved in realistically evolving a string network . here",
    "we will not be concerned with these uncertainties , since our goal is simply to pick a diverse set of concrete non - gaussian models , and use these examples to test the applicability of the non - gaussian ps formalism . to the extent to which the formalism works , we will have a tool with which we can make specific predictions for cluster evolution in a wide class of non - gaussian models , taking as input only the initial pdf @xmath2 ( which is what enters into the ps calculation ; see  [ sec - ps ] ) .",
    "we will then be able to use cluster evolution to constrain the initial pdf of the universe without referring to any specific non - gaussian models , a possibility which will be extremely useful given the difficulty of making robust predictions in so many non - gaussian scenarios .",
    "we now explain the motivation for each of the models , and present the computational details of realizing initial density fields in each case .",
    "the first non - gaussian structure formation scenario we consider is the peebles icdm model ( peebles 1983 , 1997 , 1998a , b ) .",
    "this is an inflationary model which gives rise to non - gaussian isocurvature fluctuations in the matter distribution .",
    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) in this model is a field @xmath32 with mass density @xmath33 which survives as a relic at the end of inflation .",
    "perturbations in this cdm field grow from quantum fluctuations which are frozen during the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the perturbations in @xmath32 are gaussian , with power spectrum @xmath34 over a broad range of scales , where the spectral index @xmath35 depends on the details of the model .",
    "the corresponding fluctuations in @xmath36 are non - gaussian , and it is easy to show that they have an initial power spectrum @xmath37 with @xmath38    due to the isocurvature nature of the fluctuations , the cdm density does not evolve until the matter era , and then only on scales which are inside the horizon . those modes which have crossed the horizon before matter - radiation equality will all start to grow at that time , while those modes which enter the horizon later will be increasingly suppressed . for our investigation of cluster formation",
    "we are interested mainly in the former , smaller scales , so it will be sufficient to assume scale - independent linear growth of the initial fluctuations .",
    "we consider two values of the initial spectral index of the gaussian field @xmath35 .",
    "first , we consider a model ( which we denote icdm-2.4 ) with @xmath39 , in a background cosmology with @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this set of parameters has been suggested as an interesting starting point by peebles ( 1998b ) since it gives power spectra in reasonable agreement with large scale structure and cmb data .",
    "second , we consider a model ( icdm-2.0 ) with @xmath42 , in a background cosmology with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we do not expect this model to give a particularly good fit to the large scale structure data , but we introduce it since the degree of non - gaussianity is intermediate between that of ( icdm-2.4 ) and a gaussian distribution , and it therefore allows us to test the press - schechter formalism over a wider range of models .    for each icdm model , we generate a @xmath45 realization of a gaussian random field @xmath32 with the appropriate power spectrum @xmath46 .",
    "we then compute @xmath47 , and the corresponding density perturbation @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the mean density , given by @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the number of points on the lattice . finally , we rescale the density contrast so that the density field will have the correct value of @xmath52 when linearly evolved to @xmath53 .",
    "the second class of non - gaussian model we consider is that of cosmic strings . here , structure is seeded gravitationally by an evolving network of string - like ` defects ' , topological relics of a symmetry breaking phase transition in the very early universe ( kibble 1976 ; vilenkin & shellard 1994 ) .",
    "recent work suggests that cosmic strings in a critical universe do not give a viable theory of structure formation ( allen et al 1997 ; albrecht , battye & robinson 1997 ) , although strings in a universe with a significant cosmological constant may be able to give a good fit to existing large scale structure data ( battye , robinson & albrecht 1998 ; avelino et  al 1998 ) . for the purposes of this work , we shall not be concerned by the many uncertainties in the details of realistic string dynamics .",
    "instead , we shall take a simple representative model and use it as a testing ground for our study of cluster evolution .",
    "our string - seeded density models use the string simulations of ferreira ( 1995 ) .",
    "these simulations evolve a network of strings in flat space , where an exact solution of the equations of motion exists ( smith & vilenkin 1987 ) .",
    "although the string simulations are carried out in a flat space background , the network evolution demonstrates many of the important properties which are seen in expanding universe simulations , the most important of which is the ` scaling ' of the string density , ensuring that the induced density perturbations will be roughly scale invariant on the largest scales .    following veeraraghavan & stebbins ( 1990 ) ,",
    "the matter overdensity @xmath4 induced by the network can be computed by convolving a component @xmath54 of the string stress - energy with a suitable green function , and integrating over time .",
    "that is , @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the initial and final times in the simulation , @xmath58 is the fourier transform of the induced overdensity , @xmath59 is a transfer function taken from veeraraghavan & stebbins ( 1990 ) , @xmath60 is the conformal time , @xmath61 is the cosmological scale factor , and the last term is a ` compensation factor ' , with compensation scale @xmath62 , included to ensure artificially that the density evolution conserves stress energy on the largest scales .    we carry out our flat space string simulations on a @xmath45 lattice , choosing the side of our box to be @xmath63 mpc .",
    "we work out the conformal time @xmath64 at each time - step by equating it to the simulation horizon size ( which is zero at the initial time and grows by one lattice spacing at each time - step ) . at each step , we compute the appropriate component @xmath65 of the string stress energy tensor on the lattice , fourier transform to obtain @xmath66 , and multiply by @xmath67 ) .",
    "the final density contrast is then given by the sum of individual contributions from each time - step , as in eq .",
    "[ eq - vs ] .",
    "since all significant perturbations are induced at a time when the fluctuations are still linear , it is sufficient to use linear gravity in this way to compute the initial density field , and only consider the effects of non - linear gravity in the subsequent evolution .",
    "we choose two representative string models .",
    "first , we consider a model with an @xmath43 hot dark matter ( hdm ) background with one species of massive neutrino accounting for the entire mass of the universe , and a hubble constant @xmath68 km s@xmath69 mpc@xmath69 with @xmath70 .",
    "we denote this model ` strings - hdm ' .",
    "second we consider a string network in an @xmath43 cdm background , also with @xmath70 , which we denote ` strings - cdm ' .      the final non - gaussian model we consider is one where the matter distribution has an enhanced network of primordial voids .",
    "the physical motivation for such models comes from an inflationary theory with two scalar fields ( la 1991 ) : one field drives inflation , while at the same time the second field undergoes a first order phase transition .",
    "the bubbles nucleated in this phase transition give rise to under - densities in the cdm distribution , superimposed on gaussian fluctuations which are also generated during the inflationary epoch .",
    "the detailed properties of the bubble distribution , including their sizes , shapes and profiles , will depend on the exact nature of the inflationary model , but for some range of parameters it is possible to produce bubbles which are large enough to have a significant impact on structure formation , yet still escape limits arising from current cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations ( amendola & occhionero 1991 ; amendola & borgani 1993 ) .",
    "a typical cosmologically interesting scenario would produce a dense network of bubbles with radii of order @xmath71@xmath72 mpc .",
    "for the purposes of this work , we generate a simple realization of such a model as follows : in a @xmath63 mpc box , we generate a @xmath45 realization of a gaussian density field @xmath73 , with a power spectrum @xmath74 .",
    "this spectral index is chosen so that the density field has a very similar power spectrum to that in the icdm-2.4 model , thus ensuring that our simulations primarily compare the effect of varying the amount of non - gaussianity in the fluctuations , rather than that of varying the spectral index .",
    "we then superimpose on this a distribution of @xmath75 randomly located voids , where the voids are spherically symmetric top - hat under - densities with radius @xmath76 mpc .",
    "the total density field is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the amplitude of the void under - density , @xmath79 is the centre of the @xmath80 void and @xmath81 is the window function in real space of a spherical top - hat with radius @xmath6 , that is : @xmath82 we dial the amplitude of the void under - density @xmath78 to ensure that the resulting matter field has a significant degree of non - gaussianity , without completely swamping the gaussian component of the distribution .",
    "we find @xmath83 is a suitable value , where @xmath84 is the _ rms _ value of the gaussian component , after top - hat smoothing on a scale of @xmath85 mpc .",
    "we choose @xmath86 , and generate the void centres @xmath87 by picking points at random , discarding any choices which would give rise to overlapping voids , and repeating until the number of acceptable centres equals @xmath75 .",
    "finally we rescale the field @xmath88 to ensure that it has the chosen normalization @xmath52 .",
    "in  [ sec - nongauss ] we have explained the motivation for our non - gaussian models , and set out in detail the processes involved in generating density fields which realize these models .",
    "we now describe the techniques involved in transforming these linear density fields into initial conditions for n - body simulations . for each of the models in question we start from a density field @xmath88 defined on a @xmath45 lattice .",
    "the n - body simulations require initial conditions in the form of positions and velocities of some number @xmath89 particles , which we can generate from our density fields using the zeldovich approximation ( zeldovich 1970 ) .",
    "specifically , we define a displacement field @xmath90 via @xmath91 where the subscript zero denotes the density field extrapolated to the present day assuming linear growth .",
    "starting from a regular grid of particles , the position @xmath92 of each particle at redshift @xmath11 is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the linear growth factor at redshift @xmath11 , and @xmath95 is the initial coordinate of the particle . the comoving velocity of that particle is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the physical time .",
    "we can solve eq .",
    "[ eq - disp ] for the displacement field efficiently using fourier transforms , that is : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the fourier transform of the displacement field @xmath100 , @xmath101 is the appropriate green function , @xmath102 and @xmath103 is a smoothing function , whose form is chosen to optimize agreement between the power spectrum of the input density field @xmath88 and that of the mass distribution represented by the displaced particles ( which we can measure by resampling the particle distribution as a new density field on a lattice ) .",
    "we find the choice @xmath104 gives good agreement .",
    "we evolve each density field using p@xmath105 m simulations carried out on a grape-3af board attached to a sun workstation .",
    "the grape-3af is a special purpose computer which quickly evaluates pairwise forces , allowing a cosmological simulation with @xmath106 particles to be run in under a day .",
    "the code used for our simulations is based on the p3mg3a algorithm described by brieu , summers , & ostriker ( 1995 ) .",
    "each simulation contains @xmath107 particles with a particle mass of @xmath108 m@xmath109 .",
    "the effective force resolution @xmath64 is 0.128 times the mean inter - particle separation , or @xmath110 kpc for our @xmath63 mpc box length .",
    "the initial redshifts @xmath111 for each model , chosen in each case by ensuring that @xmath112 at the nyquist frequency , are given in table  [ tab - all ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in computing these errors we do not attempt to fit for points for which @xmath113 , since the ps formalism is known to break down for these masses in the gaussian case .",
    "we see that typical errors are less than of order @xmath114 in @xmath115 .",
    "the worst systematic error is for the voids model at @xmath116 , where @xmath117 .",
    "the worst _ rms _ error is for the strings - hdm model at @xmath53 , where @xmath118 . even in these worst cases ,",
    "the errors are of order or smaller than typical measurement errors in @xmath25 , and many orders of magnitude smaller than the amount by which predictions for different models can differ .",
    "we have carried out n - body simulations of a number of models with non - gaussian initial conditions , and verified that a modified version of the press - schechter formalism is able to give a good fit to the observed evolution of the cluster number abundance over a wide range of redshifts . while we have only tested the fit for a finite number of models , the models span a range of possible types of non - gaussian behaviour .",
    "the icdm and string models have a skew positive pdf , and typically give rise to more clusters of a given mass than would be expected in the corresponding gaussian case .",
    "the voids model has a skew negative pdf , and typically gives rise to fewer clusters than would be expected in the corresponding gaussian case .",
    "the icdm model is generated purely by a local transformation on a gaussian field , so might be thought most likely to agree with the ps prediction . the voids model , on the other hand ,",
    "is generated by a more complex non - local transformation of a gaussian random field , and the strings models are generated by an entirely different process altogether .",
    "quantitatively , the fits to the predicted mass function are slightly worse in the non - gaussian models than in the gaussian one .",
    "typical fits in the non - gaussian models have _ rms _ errors in @xmath119 of @xmath120 , corresponding to an error of roughly 25% in @xmath25 .",
