    "blends of  emission lines are often among the most prominent broad emission features in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and optical spectra of broad - lined active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and the integrated flux of  emission in quasars can be greater than that of any other single emission line , including ly  @xmath6 @xcite . despite more than three decades of observational and theoretical effort , the physical conditions that give rise to  emission have remained very difficult to determine .",
    "this is due in part to the complex energy - level structure of the fe@xmath7 ion and the very large number of individual  emission lines that appear in broad blends .",
    "recent spectral synthesis models for the fe@xmath7  ion include hundreds of energy levels and tens of thousands of individual transitions @xcite .",
    "a variety of processes in the broad - line region ( blr ) can contribute to  line production , including collisional excitation as well as continuum and line fluorescence @xcite .",
    "it is not yet fully determined whether the  production in agns occurs in gas heated solely by photoionization , or whether collisional ionization might play a significant or even dominant role @xcite .",
    "a particularly promising recent development has been the realization that anisotropy in the emission from high column density clouds can have a strong impact on the observed  spectrum , and models for the emission from the shielded side of photoionized clouds have shown significant improvements in fitting observed  spectra @xcite .",
    "the  emission lines are closely linked to several fundamental issues in agn physics and phenomenology . from principal - component analysis of quasar spectra ,",
    "the relative strength of  emission is one of the major characteristics of `` eigenvector 1 ''",
    "@xcite , the component which accounts for much of the variance among the quasar population .",
    "empirically , eigenvector 1 represents the anticorrelations between  and [ ] equivalent widths , and between  strength and h@xmath0  width .",
    "the fundamental physical driver of the eigenvector 1 sequence is the eddington ratio @xmath8 @xcite , but the physical mechanism responsible for the increase in  strength with eddington ratio is not fully understood .",
    "it may be linked to the presence of a soft x - ray excess at high eddington ratio , which would produce a larger partially ionized zone of warm , -emitting gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while orientation could play a secondary role @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue against the x - ray excess as the primary driver of  strength , proposing instead that differences in gas - phase iron abundance , driven by selective depletion of iron onto grains , are primarily responsible for the wide range of observed  line strengths in agns . in another interpretation proposed by @xcite and @xcite , the competing forces of gravity and radiation pressure set a critical column density for clouds to remain gravitationally bound within the blr , and at higher eddington ratio",
    ", the higher column density of surviving blr clouds would produce a larger /h@xmath0  flux ratio . for agns having extremely strong  emission ,",
    "it has also been suggested that the shock - heated gas associated with circumnuclear star formation may be responsible for the  enhancement @xcite .",
    "furthermore ,  emission is potentially valuable as a tracer of chemical evolution .",
    "the strength of the uv  emission relative to in quasar spectra has been used as a proxy for the iron to @xmath6-element abundance ratio in the blr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the sensitivity of / line ratios to factors such as gas density and microturbulence means that observed line ratios are not straightforward indicators of the underlying abundance ratios @xcite .",
    "improved understanding of the physical conditions responsible for  emission could have important ramifications for elucidating the history of metal enrichment in the densest regions of the universe at high redshift .",
    "a key quantity of interest is the spatial scale of the -emitting region .",
    "however , there are very few measurements available that directly constrain its size .",
    "@xcite carried out reverberation mapping of the uv  lines in ngc 5548 and found a lag of about 10 days , similar to that of ly@xmath6 , indicating that the uv  lines originate from within the blr .",
    "this has been the only measurement of a reverberation lag for the uv  lines to date . aside from reverberation mapping ,",
    "one additional direct constraint exists : a spectroscopic microlensing study of a lensed quasar by @xcite found evidence that the  emission originates largely in the outer portion of the blr .",
    "previous attempts at reverberation mapping of the optical  blends have generally not led to clear detections of reverberation lags . for the well - studied agn ngc 5548",
    ", @xcite examined 13 years of monitoring data and found that the  flux responded to continuum changes on timescales of less than several weeks , but the available data did not allow for a definite measurement of the lag .",
    "@xcite measured light curves for the  blends in ark 120 and found a long - term variability trend that followed the continuum changes , but the data did not yield a significant cross - correlation lag .",
    "they concluded that the  emission region in ark 120 was likely to be several times larger than the h@xmath0-emitting zone of the blr .",
    "an alternative possibility was that the  emission might be powered by collisional excitation rather than by photoionization , although they were unable to fit the  emission blends well with collisional excitation models .",
    "@xcite measured the  light curve for pg 1700 + 518 using monitoring data from @xcite . while they were able to detect evidence of reverberation in the  lines ,",
    "the cross - correlation analysis did not yield a highly significant peak , and the measured lag of @xmath9 days was very uncertain .",
    "variability of the optical  emission has been examined in other agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but most datasets have not been suitable for measurement of reverberation lags .",
    "the overall picture that emerges from these studies is that while optical  emission does respond to continuum variations at least over long timescales , it tends to have a lower amplitude of variability than h@xmath0 , and it does not generally show a clear reverberation lag signature .    in the absence of direct constraints on the relative sizes of the  and h@xmath0  emission regions , indirect clues have come from line - profile measurements . @xcite and @xcite found that the velocity widths of the  lines are generally similar to that of h@xmath0 , suggesting that  and h@xmath0  originate from the same region within the blr .",
    "subsequent work has uncovered subtle systematic differences between h@xmath0  and optical  widths , which hint at an origin for  in the outer portion of the blr or perhaps within an `` intermediate - line region '' corresponding to the transition between the blr and the dusty torus @xcite . for a sample of 4000 sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    "quasar spectra , @xcite found that the full - width at half maximum intensity ( fwhm ) of the optical  lines is typically about @xmath10 fwhm(h@xmath0 ) , albeit with substantial scatter , implying a size for the -emitting region that is typically about twice as large as the h@xmath0-emitting zone of the blr .    here , we present new  reverberation - mapping results for two nearby seyfert galaxies , ngc 4593 and mrk 1511 , from the lick agn monitoring project 2011 .",
    "section 2 gives a brief overview of our observing campaign .",
    "section 3 describes the fitting method used to isolate the continuum and emission - line components in the spectroscopic data and the measurement of light curves . in section 4",
    "we describe the cross - correlation lag measurements and the dependence of the lags on the choice of  template , and section 5 presents a discussion of the results . in an appendix , we present a brief discussion of results based on additional newly - available  templates . while the reverberation lag measurements are modestly sensitive to the choice of  template , both of these objects clearly show evidence of  reverberation in response to continuum variations .",
    "initial results from the lick agn monitoring project 2011 were previously presented by @xcite and @xcite , and full details of the spectroscopic and photometric observing campaigns , analysis procedures , and light - curve data for all targets will be presented in a forthcoming series of papers . here , we briefly review the key aspects of the observing program .      from early march through mid - june 2011 , we obtained queue - scheduled @xmath1-band images of ngc 4593 and mrk 1511 using the 0.76  m katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ) at lick observatory @xcite , the 0.9  m telescope at the brigham young west mountain observatory ( wmo ) , the faulkes telescope south at siding spring observatory , and the palomar 1.5  m telescope @xcite .",
    "our goal was to obtain nightly imaging for each target , but weather and scheduling issues led to some gaps in coverage , particularly during the initial portion of the campaign .",
    "the temporal sampling cadence of our observations is described in table [ lcstats ] .",
    "exposure times were typically 180300  s. all images were bias - subtracted and flattened , and cosmic - ray hits were removed using the la - cosmic routine @xcite .",
    "image - subtraction photometry was carried out using a version of the isis code @xcite modified by the high-@xmath11 supernova search team @xcite and with additional modifications by w.  li , and also using the ` hotpants ` package by a. becker , which is based on the methods described by @xcite .",
    "for each telescope , a high - quality template image was chosen , and the template was then aligned with each night s image and convolved with a spatially varying kernel to match the point - spread function of that image . after subtracting the scaled template image , the variable agn flux is left as a point source in the subtracted image , allowing for aperture photometry using the iraf daophot package . the photometric aperture radius used for each telescope",
    "was set to match the average point - source fwhm for images from that telescope .",

    "normalization was done by modeling the variability using gaussian processes to obtain a finely - sampled model version of the light curve for each agn , following the same procedure described by @xcite .",
    "additive and multiplicative scaling factors were applied to match the modeled light curve to each telescope light curve , using the wmo light curve as the reference data for the model .",
    "the normalization code simultaneously constrained all scaling factors to obtain the best fit between all the telescope light curves using a markov chain monte carlo algorithm .",
    "then , scaling factors determined from the modeling were applied to the image - subtraction light curves , to normalize the data from all telescopes to a common flux scale .",
    "the final light curve was prepared by taking a weighted average of observations taken within 6 hours of one another .",
    "the @xmath1-band light curves are shown in figure [ figlightcurves ] , in arbitrary units of differential flux .",
    "our spring 2011 observing campaign consisted of 69 nights at the lick 3-m telescope between 2011 march 27 and june 13 ut . observations were done using the kast dual spectrograph @xcite .",
    "a d55 dichroic was used to separate the blue and red beams with a crossover wavelength of about 5500  . in this paper , we discuss only measurements from the blue arm of the spectrograph , where we used a 600 lines mm@xmath12  grism over @xmath135520    at a scale of 1.0   pixel@xmath12 .",
    "all observations of these two agns were done with a 4-wide slit oriented at a position angle of 45 .",
    "standard calibration frames including arc lamps and dome flats were obtained each afternoon , and flux standards were observed during twilight .",
    "exposure times were normally @xmath14  s and @xmath15  s for ngc 4593 and mrk 1511 , respectively . the weather at mt .",
    "hamilton was somewhat worse than average during spring 2011 ; we were able to observe ngc 4593 on 43 of the 69 nights , and mrk 1511 on 40 nights .",
    "spectroscopic reductions and calibrations followed standard methods implemented in iraf and idl .",
    "a large extraction width of 103 was used in order to accommodate the full extent of the agn spatial profiles observed on nights with poor seeing .",
    "error spectra were extracted and propagated through the full sequence of calibrations . in the reduced spectra , the median signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) per pixel in the range 46004700   is 122 for ngc 4593 and 71 for mrk 1511 .",
    "the reduced spectra were first normalized to a uniform flux scale by employing the procedure of @xcite .",
    "this method applies a flux scaling factor , a linear wavelength shift , and a gaussian convolution to each spectrum in order to minimize the residuals between the data and a reference spectrum constructed from several of the best - quality nights .",
    "the scaling is determined using a wavelength range containing the [ ] @xmath16 line , which is assumed to have constant flux .",
    "the upper panels of figure [ figmean - veron ] show the mean of all scaled spectra for each object .    to assess the accuracy of the scaling procedure",
    ", we measured the light curve of the [ ] @xmath16 line in the scaled spectra and calculated the residual `` excess '' scatter @xmath17 in the [ ] light curve .",
    "we follow the usual definition for the normalized excess variance @xcite : @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the total number of observations , @xmath20 is the mean flux , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the individual flux values and their uncertainties",
    ". then @xmath17 gives a measure of the fractional scatter in the light curve due to random errors in flux scaling , over and above the scatter that would be expected based on the propagated photon - counting uncertainties .",
    "for ngc 4593 and mrk 1511 , we obtain an excess scatter of @xmath23 and 2.0% , respectively .",
    "these low values indicate that the scaling procedure worked well . as we describe below",
    ", these measures of residual scatter will be added to the error budget of the emission - line light curves to give a more realistic estimate of the total uncertainties .",
    "traditionally , broad emission - line fluxes in reverberation - mapping data have been measured by choosing continuum regions on either side of an emission line , fitting a line to the continuum , and integrating the flux above that line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , in agn spectra there may be no pure continuum regions at all surrounding h@xmath0 , because , , and other emission features are present .",
    "choosing continuum regions that contain some emission - line flux could potentially bias a reverberation lag measurement , particularly for velocity - resolved reverberation signals in the faint high - velocity wings of h@xmath0 .",
    "an alternative approach is based on decomposition of spectra into continuum and emission - line components , so that the flux contributions of individual emission features can be isolated .",
    "our multi - component fitting method was previously applied to mrk 50 @xcite and is similar to the method used by @xcite .",
    "we carry out fits over the wavelength range extending from just blueward of the h@xmath24  line ( @xmath25  ) up to 5470   near the dichroic cutoff . over this wavelength range ,",
    "each nightly spectrum was fit with a model consisting of several components : a power - law featureless continuum ( fc ) , a starlight template broadened in velocity by convolution with a gaussian , emission lines including h@xmath0 , [ ] @xmath26 ,  @xmath27 , and three lines ( 4471 , 4922 , and 5016  ) , and an  template broadened in velocity by convolution with a gaussian .",
    "for the starlight template , we use an 11 gyr - old simple stellar population model at solar metallicity from @xcite .",
    "we experimented with adding younger stellar population components , but the 11 gyr model provided a sufficiently good fit that more complex stellar population models are not warranted , and the flux of a young population component is usually not very well constrained over this limited wavelength range .",
    "we used two different templates to model the  lines , from boroson & green ( 1992 ; hereinafter bg92 ) , and vron - cetty et al .",
    "( 2004 ; hereinafter v04 ) .",
    "the overall quality of the fits is very similar with the two  templates , but there are some subtle differences that affect the reverberation lag measurements .",
    "we find that the v04 template produces better results than the bg92 template ( see section [ sec : templates ] ) , but we describe measurements and reverberation lags derived from both sets of spectral fits in order to illustrate the dependence of the results on the choice of  template .    the broad component of h@xmath0 , as well as the [ ] lines , are represented by fourth - order gauss - hermite functions , while gaussians were used to represent weaker features including narrow h@xmath0 , the broad and narrow components of , and the lines .",
    "we found that the complex shape of the h@xmath24 + [ ] @xmath28 blend was difficult to model , and instead of adding more model components we simply set the wavelength range subtended by this feature to have zero weight in the fit ( 42804395   rest wavelength ) .",
    "additionally , a uniform foreground extinction was applied to the model spectrum using the @xcite reddening law .",
    "this extinction correction represents the combined effects of galactic foreground extinction , extinction within the agn host galaxy , and wavelength - dependent slit losses resulting from the nonparallactic slit orientation @xcite . since these slit losses differ from night to night , we allowed the value of @xmath29 to vary freely in each fit .",
    "the full model includes 29 free parameters , and was fitted to the observed spectrum by @xmath30 minimization using a levenberg - marquardt technique @xcite . for each galaxy ,",
    "the fit was first carried out on the high - s / n mean spectrum , and then the parameters from the best fit to the mean spectrum were used as starting parameter estimates for the fit to each nightly spectrum .",
    "for both objects , the fit optimization always drove the flux of @xmath31 to zero , using either  template .",
    "however , inclusion of the other lines at 4922 and 5016   does significantly improve the fit quality compared to model fits that omit these lines , at least when using the v04 template .",
    "previous work has shown that these two lines can be important contributors to the `` red - shelf '' region redward of h@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the red shelf also contains some  emission @xcite and the i  zw  1 templates contain some  flux in this region .",
    "however , the relative amount differs between the bg92 and v04 templates , such that the v04 template has relatively weaker  emission in the h@xmath0  red shelf , and this leads to noticeably different fitting results for the two templates .",
    "using the v04 template , we found that the  template alone did not produce an adequate fit to the red shelf unless the lines were added as separate components .",
    "when fits are carried out using the bg92  template instead , the fluxes of the @xmath32 components in the h@xmath0  red shelf region go to zero or nearly zero , and essentially all of the flux in the h@xmath0  red shelf is taken up by the  template .",
    "another difficulty in fitting this region is that the @xmath33 line is degenerate with the red wing of h@xmath0 ; in order to achieve a consistent deblending of this spectral region into h@xmath0  and flux , we constrained the 4922   and 5016   lines to have identical fluxes ( following * ? ? ? * ) and identical velocity widths . in the fits",
    ", these two components essentially track the same shape as two broad bumps in the broadened  templates . due to the degeneracy between the several features contributing to the h@xmath0  red shelf , we are unable to determine a physically unique decomposition of this region into separate contributions from h@xmath0 , , , and [ ] .",
    "the fits are able to match the observed spectra well in this region using either  template , but the slight differences in the red shelf decompositions may be partly responsible for the dependence of the reverberation lags on the choice of template .",
    "the strength and broadening of the  component in the fit are primarily determined by the prominent blend around @xmath344700   containing several transitions from  multiplets 37 and 38 .",
    "the velocity - broadening width of  was allowed to vary independently to optimize the fit to each nightly spectrum , but the variation from night to night was relatively small . from the best fit to each night",
    "s data using the v04 template , the median velocity broadening ( i.e. , the dispersion of the gaussian broadening kernel ) applied to the  template is @xmath35 km  s@xmath12  for ngc 4593 and @xmath36 km",
    "s@xmath12  for mrk 1511 .",
    "the v04 template itself was constructed using lorentzian profiles for each line , with a width of fwhm = 1100 km  s@xmath12  to match the line profiles in i  zw  1 @xcite .",
    "we find a similarly small night - to - night scatter in the width of the  broadening kernel when using the bg92 template ( @xmath37 km  s@xmath12 ) , although the overall amount of broadening is substantially smaller due to the different template structure .",
    "the bg92 template is characterized by an intrinsic fwhm@xmath38900 km  s@xmath12  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but as an empirically - derived template it contains features with a range of widths , and shapes that do not correspond precisely to simple gaussian or lorentzian profiles . as a result , it is not straightforward to compare the inferred  widths as measured using the two different templates , but for each template the fitting procedure consistently converges on a value for the  broadening that varies only by a few percent from night to night .",
    "we comment further on the  profile widths in section [ discussion ] .",
    "figures [ figmean - veron ] and [ figmean - boroson ] show the mean spectrum for each agn with its best - fitting model , and the individual fit components , for the fits done using the v04 and bg92  templates .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) spectrum is constructed by taking the standard deviation of the scaled spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in each of these figures we show the rms spectrum , as well as a modified version constructed by subtracting the agn fc and stellar - continuum components from each nightly spectrum before calculating the rms .",
    "removing the continuum components gives an improved rms spectrum by eliminating small residual stellar absorption - line features @xcite , and the continuum - subtracted rms spectrum more accurately depicts the rms variability profiles of the emission lines . fits done using the bg92 template assign relatively more flux to  than fits with the v04 template .",
    "for the bg92 fits , the increased  flux ( at the expense of the fc component ) results in a higher rms flux in the continuum - subtracted rms spectra .      light curves were measured for individual emission lines from continuum - subtracted spectra . for h@xmath0  and the h@xmath24 + [ ] blend",
    ", we produced a residual spectrum by subtracting all other model components , and then measured the emission - line light curves by summation of the residual flux .",
    "the h@xmath24  and h@xmath0  integration regions were 43204450   and 48005000   for ngc 4593 , and 44204560   and 49205120   for mrk 1511 ( in the observed frame ) .",
    "the resulting light curves include the constant contributions of narrow h@xmath0  and h@xmath24  as well as [ ] @xmath28 blended with h@xmath24 .",
    "light curves for  @xmath27 were measured by summation of the best - fitting broad and narrow  model components .",
    "this produced a less noisy light curve than the alternate approach of calculating a  residual spectrum for each night by subtracting all of the other model components .",
    "however , for ngc 4593 the  emission was too weak to produce a useful light curve .",
    "the  light curves were computed by summation of the best - fitting  model over 44004900  , but any wavelength range would yield the same overall light - curve shape since the model fit assumes a uniform flux scaling factor for the  template .",
    "the fc light curves were measured by integration over the same wavelength range used for .",
    "as described above , the residual scatter measured from the [ ] light curves represents a major contribution to the error budget in the light - curve measurements .",
    "therefore , we combine the residual scatter ( 1.2% for ngc 4593 and 2.0% for mrk 1511 ) in quadrature with the measurement uncertainties in the individual light - curve points to obtain a more realistic estimate of the true overall uncertainties .",
    "the emission - line light curves displayed in figure [ figlightcurves ] are shown with these expanded error bars .",
    "addition of the residual flux - scaling scatter to the error budget widens the measurement uncertainties in the cross - correlation lags described below , but only slightly . in figure",
    "[ figlightcurves ] we show only the spectroscopic light curves measured using the v04 template fits because the light curves measured from the bg92 fits are extremely similar in overall appearance .",
    "observations of other agns have shown that the amplitude of  variability is typically somewhat smaller than that of h@xmath0 .",
    "for example , in ngc 5548 @xcite found that the  variation amplitude was @xmath39%75% of that of h@xmath0 .",
    "to characterize the variability amplitude in ngc 4593 and mrk 1511 , we use @xmath17 as defined in equation 1 , which gives a measure of the normalized rms variability , corrected for measurement uncertainties .",
    "based on the v04 fits , the results for ngc 4593 are @xmath17(h@xmath0)@xmath40 and @xmath17()@xmath41 , while for mrk 1511 we measure @xmath17(h@xmath0)@xmath42 and @xmath17()@xmath43 . with the bg92 template",
    "fits , the @xmath17 values for h@xmath0  are essentially unchanged , while @xmath17 ( ) increases by @xmath44 relative to the values determined from the v04 fits .",
    "thus , both objects show a somewhat higher amplitude of variability in h@xmath0  than , similar to the behavior seen in ngc 5548 @xcite .    for agns having a very low starlight fraction ,",
    "it is often possible to measure the agn continuum flux from the spectra directly , without carrying out a decomposition to separate the agn flux from the host galaxy contribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , this approach is much less successful for agns having a substantial host galaxy component in the spectra , since the starlight dilutes the variability of the agn continuum and introduces additional random noise due to nightly variations in seeing and target centering within the slit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given the substantial contributions of both stellar continuum and  in these two objects , the spectral decomposition method is necessary in order to measure the agn continuum flux without contamination or dilution by these other components .",
    "in order to measure the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) for unevenly sampled time series , we employ the interpolation cross - correlation function ( iccf ) methodology and monte carlo error - analysis techniques described by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "emission - line lags for h@xmath0 , h@xmath24 , , and  were measured relative to both the @xmath1-band and fc light curves .",
    "ccfs were computed over a temporal range of @xmath45 to @xmath46  days in increments of 0.25 days . for each ccf",
    "we compute two measures of the lag time : @xmath47 , which is the lag at the peak of the ccf , and @xmath2 , the centroid of the ccf for all points above 80% of the peak value @xcite .",
    "table [ xcortable ] lists the lag values .",
    "the quantity @xmath48  listed in table [ xcortable ] gives the peak amplitude of the ccf and is a measure of the significance of the correlation between the two light curves .",
    "we obtain higher @xmath48  values for ngc 4593 than for mrk 1511 , primarily owing to the higher s / n of the ngc 4593 light curves .",
    "lag values are given in the observed frame and can be converted to the agn rest frame by dividing by @xmath49 , where the redshifts are @xmath50 for ngc 4593 and @xmath51 for mrk 1511 .",
    "there are advantages and drawbacks to using either the @xmath1-band data or spectroscopic fc light curves in the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "the @xmath1-band light curves have more frequent sampling than the spectroscopic data , and better temporal sampling will always improve the determination of the ccf .",
    "additionally , the spectroscopic data suffer from systematic effects including variable slit losses due to miscentering and differential atmospheric refraction , while the photometric data are not susceptible to these problems .",
    "however , the @xmath1-band data include contributions of emission - line flux in addition to the agn continuum , while the spectroscopic decompositions can be used to produce a `` pure '' fc light curve without contamination by strong emission lines .",
    "a disadvantage of using the spectroscopic data in cross - correlation measurements is the effect of correlated flux - calibration errors between the emission - line and continuum light curves , which can introduce a spurious signal at zero lag .",
    "we find that using the @xmath1-band light curves produces consistently higher - quality results , but the reverberation lags are consistent when measured against either the @xmath1 band or fc light curves . for completeness , table [ xcortable ]",
    "presents all of the lag measurements based on the spectral decompositions using both the v04 and bg92  templates , and for cross - correlations computed with both the @xmath1-band and fc light curves .",
    "we tested the effect of detrending the data by subtracting a linear fit to the light curves before computing the ccfs .",

    "the v04 template , on the other hand , gives a better - behaved result and smaller lag uncertainties .",
    "the cause of this difference is not obvious , but it does appear that the v04 template gives a clearly superior result at least for ngc 4593 .",
    "an additional possible concern is degeneracy between the stellar and agn continuum components in the fit . for both objects",
    ", the light curves of the starlight component do not show any significant time - dependent features other than random noise .",

    "the resulting ccfs had very low peak amplitudes of @xmath113 and 0.43 for ngc 4593 and mrk 1511 , respectively , and had such irregular structure that no clear lag signal could be measured in either case .",
    "this provides further evidence that the spectral decompositions are properly separating the contributions of the continuum components .",
    "a small bias in reverberation lag measurements can occur when broad - band photometry is used for the continuum flux measurement , due to the contribution of emission - line flux to the photometric light curves .",

    "we simulated the effect of the emission - line flux in the @xmath1-band light curves by creating mock reverberation datasets having properties similar to those of our observed data . following the method of @xcite",

    "each light curve was generated over a total duration of 1000 days .",
    "a shorter segment of length 100 days was then selected randomly and normalized to have an rms variability equal to 15% of the median flux .",
    "the h@xmath0  and  lines were assumed to respond linearly to continuum variations , with a delta function as the transfer function for simplicity , and with lag times of 6 days for h@xmath0  and 9 days for .",
    "variability amplitudes for the emission lines were normalized so that h@xmath0  had the same 15% rms variability as the continuum , while  was set to have a lower rms variability amplitude of 12% .",
    "then , a `` contaminated '' @xmath1-band light curve was created by adding scaled versions of the h@xmath0  and  light curves to the fc light curve , in the relative proportions listed above for mrk 1511 .",
    "all of the light curves ( fc , @xmath1 band , h@xmath0 , and ) were then degraded to approximate the sampling and s / n of real data .",
    "from the finely sampled light curves , one flux point was chosen per night , randomly sampled from a window of @xmath118 hours relative to a uniform 24-hour cadence , and over a total spectroscopic monitoring duration of 80 days .",
    "weather losses were approximated by randomly removing 10% of the points from the fc and @xmath1-band light curves and 40% of the points from the emission - line light curves .",
    "random gaussian noise was added to attain s / n = 100 for the fc and @xmath1-band data , and s /",
    "n = 50 for the emission - line light curves .",
    "the  light curve was cross - correlated against both the pure fc light curve and the contaminated @xmath1-band light curve , to determine the typical level of the bias , and this procedure was repeated @xmath119 times to build up a distribution of lag measurements for different initial realizations of the light - curve shape .",
    "we compiled the values of @xmath2  for the subset of simulations that produced `` successful '' measurements of lag , meaning that the ccf had @xmath120 and yielded a nonnegative value of @xmath2 ; by these criteria 83% of the simulations were successful .",
    "for this subset , the median lag of  relative to the pure agn continuum is @xmath121 days , which is closely consistent with the input lag of 9 days .",
    "( the uncertainty of @xmath122 days represents the 68% confidence interval on @xmath2  for the set of successful simulations .",
    ") when the simulated  light curves are cross - correlated against the simulated @xmath1-band data including emission - line contributions , we find a median lag of @xmath123 days .",
    "as expected , this is shorter than the lag measured with respect to the pure agn continuum , but the difference of 0.7 days in the median measurements is smaller than the uncertainty in the measured  lag for either of our targets .",
    "thus , the impact of this bias on the emission - line lag measurements is fairly small , most likely below the level of the @xmath124 uncertainties in the  lags",
    ". the effect of emission - line contamination in the @xmath1-band light curves would be similar for all of the cross - correlation measurements for a given agn , so the inferred relative sizes of the  and h@xmath0  emission regions would be only modestly affected .      among the reverberation measurements listed in table [ xcortable ] , the strongest differences between results based on the v04 and bg92 template fits are in the lag of  relative to the @xmath1 band .",
    "the bg92 fits give @xmath2  values that are 23 days lower than the values measured from the v04 fits .",
    "this difference appears to stem from the different proportions of fc and  fluxes for the two sets of spectral fits .",
    "as can be seen in figures [ figmean - veron ] and [ figmean - boroson ] , the broadened v04 template approaches zero flux density for the  emission in the blue wing of h@xmath0 , as well as at the blue end of our fitting region . the broadened bg92 template ,",
    "on the other hand , does not reach zero flux density anywhere in our fitting region , producing a higher `` pseudo - continuum '' level from blended  lines and forcing the fc component to a lower overall flux than in the v04 fits .",
    "we suspect that the bg92 template fits are including a small amount of agn continuum flux into the  fit component .",
    "this small contribution of agn continuum flux in the  light curves would add a spurious signal at zero lag to the cross - correlations between  and the @xmath1-band data , slightly biasing the lags toward low values .",
    "these differences stem from the methods used to construct the  templates .",
    "the bg92 template is based on an observed spectrum of i  zw  1 .",
    "emission lines from several transitions other than  were removed , and the continuum was removed by fitting a polynomial to regions between strong emission lines , leaving an approximate  emission spectrum .",
    "the v04 template is also based on an observed spectrum of i  zw  1 , but was constructed by removing a much larger list of non-  emission features , and also removing narrow permitted and forbidden  lines which were found to be much stronger in i  zw  1 than in most typical seyfert 1 spectra .",
    "each  line in the remaining spectrum was then modeled with a lorentzian profile of fwhm@xmath125 km  s@xmath12 , producing a noise - free template .",
    "the more rigorous removal of non-  emission features and narrow  lines by v04 is a major reason to prefer the v04 template over the bg92 template for these fits .",
    "furthermore , the empirical and somewhat subjective procedure used to remove the agn continuum by bg92 may be responsible for the fitting degeneracy between the  and fc components described above .",
    "if the agn continuum were undersubtracted when constructing the bg92 template , there would be almost no noticeable impact on the quality of individual spectral fits that used the template , but the mixing of fc and  emission would likely bias the reverberation lags measured for the  component .    for ngc 4593 , the ccf measured between the  and fc light curves is certainly better when the v04 template is used , compared with the bg92 template .",
    "the reason for this difference is not clear , and it only appears to occur for ngc 4593 and not mrk 1511 , but it does add one additional reason to prefer the v04 template fits . for all of these reasons , we consider the measurements done using the v04 template fits to be our best - quality results .",
    "most importantly , our main results are independent of the template choice : in either case we find that  emission does show a strong reverberation response , with a lag time longer than that of h@xmath0 . as described in the appendix , we find similar results when using the newly released multi - component  templates of @xcite . with these new templates ,",
    "we obtain slightly different values of @xmath2  for the emission lines , but the  lags are still consistently longer than those of h@xmath0 , with @xmath2()/@xmath2(h@xmath0)@xmath126 .",
    "this further confirms that the larger size of the -emitting region ( compared with h@xmath0 ) is genuine and not an artifact of template choice .",
    "it is also worth noting that the different template fits yield differing amounts of  and emission underlying the broad h@xmath0  profile .",
    "the uncertain amount of blending of h@xmath0  with other emission features ( each having a different lag relative to the continuum ) could represent a limiting factor for the accuracy of high - fidelity reverberation measurements , particularly for velocity - resolved lag measurements which attempt to determine the distribution of lag across the velocity width of the line . any ambiguity in decomposing the h@xmath0  spectral region into different emission - line components",
    "should be considered as a source of systematic uncertainty in determining the h@xmath0  lag distribution across the line profile .",
    "this is the first time that such clear reverberation signals have been seen for the optical  blends in seyfert galaxies .",
    "our high - cadence monitoring data reveal that the  emission in these galaxies does reverberate on short timescales in response to continuum variations , with a well - defined cross - correlation lag time .",
    "this gives direct evidence for an origin of the  emission in photoionized gas in the blr .",
    "the ambiguity in previous  reverberation results for ngc 5548 @xcite and ark 120 @xcite might be attributable to the lower cadence of the monitoring data used in these studies , although in both cases the monitoring duration spanned several years .",
    "it is also possible that the  variability behavior in our two objects is not representative of the entire population of seyferts .",
    "measurement of  variability over a broad range of agn properties should be a high priority for future high - cadence reverberation - mapping programs . by exploring a broad range of luminosities",
    ", it might be possible to test whether the optical  emission follows a radius - luminosity relationship similar to that of the h@xmath0  line , with a luminosity dependence of approximately @xmath127 @xcite",
    ". it would be particularly interesting to test whether the ratio of  to h@xmath0  radii varies systematically along the eigenvector 1 sequence as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "if the -emitting gas is infalling toward the central engine , as proposed by @xcite , then there might also be observable correlations between the reverberation lag and the redshift of the  lines , although evidence for radial inflow remains controversial @xcite .",
    "the measured values of @xmath2  give an approximate mean radius for the zone from which each line is emitted within the blr .",
    "comparing the lags of  and h@xmath0  for the preferred v04 template fits , we find @xmath3()@xmath128(h@xmath0 ) @xmath129 and @xmath5 in ngc 4593 and mrk 1511 , respectively .",
    "this gives a direct indication that the  emission arises predominantly in the outer portion of the blr on larger scales than the h@xmath0  emission region .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with several other recent lines of evidence for an outer blr location for the  emission @xcite .",
    "we use the term `` outer blr '' to denote emission from a region having a larger mean size than the h@xmath0  emission zone . aside from ,",
    "the only broad emission lines seen to have lags longer than that of h@xmath0  are ] @xmath130 @xcite and h@xmath6  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the emission regions for these lines correspond to the outermost observable portion of the blr .",
    "the bg92 template fits give different ratios of  to h@xmath0  lag , but we find that @xmath2 ( ) @xmath131 @xmath2(h@xmath0 ) for either template .",
    "the longer lag of  relative to h@xmath0  does not mean that the h@xmath0  and  emission regions are physically distinct ; in fact , there must be a very substantial radial overlap between them .",
    "recent progress in transfer - function modeling for reverberation - mapping data has provided direct illustrations of the radial extent of the blr as seen in balmer lines . for arp 151 ,",
    "the transfer functions show that the h@xmath0  emission extends over a broad radial zone with an outer extent that is more than twice as large as @xmath132 , and the h@xmath6-emitting region is several times larger in extent than the mean h@xmath0  radius @xcite .",
    "if the ratios of  to h@xmath0  size for ngc 4593 and mrk 1511 are typical , then the -emitting zone would encompass the outer portion of the h@xmath0-emitting zone of the blr and beyond , probably corresponding roughly to the region emitting h@xmath6 .",
    "this echoes the recent finding by @xcite that quasar h@xmath0  profiles generically contain an intermediate - width component which may be emitted from the same region that produces , while the very broad component of h@xmath0  would be emitted from smaller radii .",
    "further support for a link between the  region and the outer portion of the balmer - line emitting zone of the blr comes from a new principal - component analysis of quasar spectra by @xcite .",
    "they demonstrate that one of the primary eigenspectra of their quasar sample is essentially the sum of two components : the  emission spectrum and an intermediate - width core component of the balmer lines , which are readily interpreted as arising from a similar spatial region .",
    "@xcite found that  line widths in sdss quasars are typically about 3/4 of the h@xmath0  widths . in order to test whether ngc 4593 and mrk",
    "1511 are consistent with this trend , we examine the results of the spectral fits done using the bg92  template , since this closely follows the fitting method used by @xcite .",
    "we assume that the total velocity width of fwhm is given by the quadrature sum of the fwhm of the broadening kernel from the fit and the fwhm of the line profiles in the template itself which we take to be 900 km  s@xmath12  for consistency with @xcite .",
    "we also correct the observed widths for an instrumental broadening of fwhm@xmath133 km  s@xmath12  @xcite .",
    "then , we obtain  widths of fwhm@xmath134 km  s@xmath12  for ngc 4593 and @xmath135 km  s@xmath12  for mrk 1511 , where the uncertainties are based on the night - to - night scatter in the width of the  gaussian broadening kernel determined by the fitting procedure",
    ". the broad - h@xmath0  component models for the two agns have fwhm = @xmath136 km  s@xmath12  for ngc 4593 and @xmath137 km  s@xmath12  for mrk 1511 . in both cases , then , fwhm()/fwhm(h@xmath0 ) is almost precisely 0.75 , closely consistent with the average result for the @xcite sample .",
    "however , we also find that the inferred  widths seem to be substantially dependent on choice of template .",
    "using our results from fitting with the v04 template , we obtain broader  widths of fwhm = @xmath138 km  s@xmath12  and @xmath139 km  s@xmath12  for ngc 4593 and mrk 1511 , in both cases broader than the h@xmath0  fwhm values .",
    "this appears to be the result of a combination of factors including different relative strengths for individual  lines between the two templates , and the fact that the v04 template is constructed using lorentzian models fitted to each line .",
    "one consequence of these lorentzian profiles is that the fwhm values of the template itself and of the gaussian broadening kernel do not simply add in quadrature to give the fwhm of the total line profile ; the fwhm of the gaussian - broadened template profile is broader than the quadrature sum of the template fwhm and broadening kernel fwhm .",
    "based on the fits done using the bg92 template , we can conclude that these two agns have fwhm()/fwhm(h@xmath0 ) ratios consistent with the mean value found by @xcite for a large sdss sample , so there is no evidence that they are outliers from the normal agn population .",
    "however , the absolute determination of  width seems to be subject to substantial systematic uncertainty due to the details of how the fit is performed and choice of template .",
    "further investigation of the cause of this discrepancy in  widths for different templates is beyond the scope of this paper , but this problem is likely to affect all inferences about  profile widths measured by template fitting , particularly when the individual  features are completely blended into a pseudocontinuum as is the case in these two objects .",
    "in addition to the systematic issues related to choice of  template , there are some additional and important caveats to note about the measured  lags .",
    "the ccf methodology only gives a single , simplistic measure of the lag time for an emission line , whereas in reality a given spectral line will be emitted over a broad range of radii .",
    "it might be possible to obtain more detailed information on the radial distribution of  emissivity by applying the geometric modeling methods described by @xcite or by applying techniques to extract the shape of the transfer function from the data @xcite .",
    "however , the  light curves are relatively noisy and higher - quality data might be required , perhaps over a longer monitoring duration , in order to go beyond the simple cross - correlation determination of the  lag presented here . furthermore , our spectral fits assume a uniform flux scaling for the entire  template , which results in an average lag measurement for the entire complex of  blends , but this method is unable to explore the possibility of different response times for different  lines .",
    "recent work has improved on traditional template - fitting methods by allowing for different behavior among different groups of  lines @xcite , and @xcite demonstrated that in ark 564 ,  lines from different multiplets showed differing levels of correlation with continuum variations .",
    "application of such methods to reverberation - mapping data could potentially detect or constrain differences in reverberation timescale for different  multiplets as well .",
    "the primary conclusions of this study are that measurement of the reverberation lag of the optical  blends is indeed possible in favorable cases , and that in these two agns the  emission responds directly to continuum variations with a lag time that corresponds to the outer portion of the blr , somewhat larger than the h@xmath0-emitting radius . with well - sampled data it is possible to detect this reverberation signature with a level of significance comparable to that of high - quality h@xmath0  reverberation measurements .",
    "detection of  reverberation does require some special circumstances , in particular a high amplitude of continuum variability , as well as relatively strong  emission overall . in all other objects from our 2011 sample ,",
    "either the  emission was too weak ( as in mrk 50 ; * ? ? ? * ) , or the overall flux variability was too low for measurements like these to be successful .",
    "finally , these results illustrate the value of carrying out spectral decompositions of reverberation - mapping data , in order to measure accurate light curves for , , and other weak or low - amplitude spectral features .",
    "application of these methods for measurement of emission - line light curves for our entire 2011 sample will be described in future papers in this series .",

    "we mourn the tragic passing of our friend and collaborator , weidong li , who devotedly oversaw the nightly operation of kait and taught us much about photometry .",
    "this work is dedicated to the memory of lick observatory staff member greg sulger .",
    "after this paper was submitted , the referee informed us that a public release of the multicomponent  templates from @xcite had recently been announced @xcite .",
    "although a full study of  variability using these new templates is beyond the scope of this paper , we carried out an initial examination by adapting our fitting method to use these templates .",
    "as described by @xcite and @xcite , the template set includes spectra describing  lines from four separate multiplet groups ( denoted as the _ f _ , _ g _ , _ s _ , and _ p _ groups ) , as well as an additional template containing other lines found in the",
    "i  zw  1 spectrum .",
    "carrying out fits using this set of five templates gives substantially more freedom to accurately fit observed  spectra than the monolithic templates of bg92 or v04 , at the cost of adding four additional free parameters to allow for the individual flux scaling of each  component .",
    "figure [ figmean - kov ] illustrates the fits to the mean spectra using these multicomponent templates .",
    "similar to the fits with the v04 and bg92 templates , the model reproduces the overall spectral shape well , but there are significant differences in the fit details compared with the monolithic templates .",
    "using the @xcite templates , the fit assigns relatively more flux to the starlight component and less to the fc . also , these fits force the fluxes of all three lines to zero , and the red shelf of h@xmath0  becomes dominated by , similar to the results from using the bg92 template .",
    "another notable difference is seen at the shortest wavelengths , below about @xmath140  . in this region , the primary  contribution is from the _ p _ group , and the fit forces the normalization of this component to zero .",
    "this is most likely a spurious result due to degeneracies in the model fitting process , but it occurs consistently when fitting each individual spectrum for both agns . these multicomponent templates are optimally suited for use with agn - dominated spectra having very strong  emission , such as the objects studied by @xcite and @xcite , but the high starlight fraction and relatively weaker  emission in our targets presents a more difficult case study for constraining the weights of the five - component  model .    in order to check for differences with respect to the previous spectral fits , we measured h@xmath0  and  light curves based on these decompositions following the same methods described previously , and carried out cross - correlations of these light curves against the @xmath1-band continuum .",
    "the  light curve was integrated over the same spectral region used for the monolithic templates , in this case corresponding primarily to flux from the _ f _ group template .    for ngc 4593",
    ", we find @xmath2(h@xmath0)@xmath141 days , and @xmath2()@xmath142 days . for mrk 1511 , the results are @xmath2(h@xmath0)@xmath143 days and @xmath2()@xmath144 days .",
    "these results are generally consistent with the measurements done using the bg92 and v04 template fits , with the largest disagreements only being at slightly greater than the @xmath124 level .",
    "the modest disagreements further highlight the fact that the reverberation results are somewhat sensitive to the different structures of the  templates . despite these differences ,",
    "our primary result is essentially unchanged : the  reverberation lags based on the new template fits are @xmath145 longer than those of h@xmath0 , pointing to an origin for the  emission in the outer portion of the blr . in future work , these multicomponent templates may prove to be most advantageous when fitting very high s / n spectra of agns having smaller starlight contributions and stronger  lines whose relative amplitudes can be more tightly constrained in the fits ."
