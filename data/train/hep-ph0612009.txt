    "fragmentation functions are used for calculating cross sections of high - energy hadron - production processes .",
    "they describe how a hadron is produced in the final state from a parent quark , antiquark , or gluon .",
    "recently , they are becoming increasingly important because semi - inclusive hadron - production processes are investigated for finding the origin of nucleon spin and properties of quark - hadron matters in lepton - nucleon scattering and hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "there have been studies of determining the functions from hadron - production data in electron - positron annihilation @xcite .",
    "it is known that determined functions are very different between the parametrization groups , for example kkp ( kniehl , kramer , and potter ) and kretzer .",
    "it is unfortunate that uncertainties of the functions were not estimated although they have been studied in parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the nucleon @xcite and nuclei @xcite .",
    "the major purpose of our work is to investigate the uncertainties of the fragmentation functions @xcite in both leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of the running coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "the fragmentation functions are determined by analyzing the data for charged - hadron production in electron - positron annihilation .",
    "the fragmentation function for hadron @xmath3 is defined by the cross section for @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 with the center - of - mass energy @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the total hadronic cross section .",
    "the variable @xmath2 is given by the hadron energy @xmath9 and the beam energy @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "the fragmentation process occurs from primary quarks , antiquarks , and gluons , so that the function is expressed by their contributions : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a fragmentation function of the hadron @xmath3 from a parton @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 is a coefficient function , and @xmath17 indicates a convolution integral @xcite .    in our analysis ,",
    "the functions are defined at fixed @xmath1 ( @xmath18 ) as @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are parameters . instead of @xmath20",
    ", we use a second moment @xmath23 as a parameter in our analysis because its physical meaning is clearer .",
    "they are related by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the beta function .",
    "the parameters are determined from a @xmath26 analysis of the data .",
    "the data are taken at large @xmath1 , typically @xmath27 , and the functions are evolved to experimental @xmath1 points by the timelike dglap equations .",
    "the parameters are determined by minimizing the total @xmath26 , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are experimental and theoretical fragmentation functions , and @xmath31 is an experimental error .",
    "the uncertainties of the obtained functions are calculated by the hessian method @xcite : @xmath32 ^ 2=\\delta \\chi^2 \\sum_{j , k } \\left ( \\frac{\\partial d_i^h ( z,\\xi)}{\\partial \\xi_j }   \\right)_{\\hat\\xi } h_{jk}^{-1 } \\left ( \\frac{\\partial d_i^h ( z,\\xi)}{\\partial \\xi_k }   \\right)_{\\hat\\xi } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the hessian , @xmath34 is a parameter , and the parameter set at the minimum @xmath26 is denoted by @xmath35 .",
    "the parameters are determined by fitting the data for @xmath36 . as an example , the obtained fragmentation functions in the nlo are compared with experimental data for the charged pions ( @xmath37 ) in fig .",
    "1 , where fractional differences @xmath38 are shown for the fragmentation functions at the experimental @xmath1 points . there are fourteen parameters in the pion analysis .",
    "the number of the data is 264 .",
    "the bands indicate the one-@xmath39 uncertainty ranges estimated by the hessian method .",
    "the data are generally well explained by our parametrization ; however , the delphi data significantly deviate from our fit .",
    "the total @xmath26 is 433.5 in the nlo analysis for the pion so that @xmath26/d.o.f .",
    "is 1.73 . in the lo analysis ,",
    "the total @xmath26 is slightly larger .",
    "determined fragmentation functions for @xmath40 are shown at @xmath1=1 gev@xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 in fig .",
    "the functions in the lo and nlo are indicated by the dashed and solid curves , and the uncertainties in the lo and nlo are shown by the light- and dark - shaded bands , respectively .",
    "it is important that the uncertainties are now shown in this work for the fragmentation functions . at small @xmath1 ( @xmath45 gev@xmath41 ) ,",
    "the uncertainties are large , especially in the lo .",
    "the uncertainty bands become smaller in the nlo .",
    "it is very difficult to determine the gluon function ; however , an improvement can be seen in the nlo because the uncertainty becomes much smaller .",
    "the functions are relatively well determined at large @xmath1 ( @xmath46 ) , where the @xmath47 data are taken .",
    "similar analyses have been done for the kaons and proton / anti - proton . in both cases ,",
    "the values of @xmath26/d.o.f .",
    "are about two , and the data are generally well explained by our parametrization . as an example , the functions for @xmath48 are shown in fig .",
    "3 with their uncertainty bands .",
    "the notations are the same as the ones in fig .",
    "the functions have large uncertainty bands also for the kaon at small @xmath1 .",
    "the large uncertainties suggest that the hadron - production cross sections have large ambiguities if they are calculated in the small @xmath49 region .",
    "the obtained functions for the proton as well as the detailed discussions on the pions and kaons are found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    from the @xmath26 analysis of the data for @xmath47@xmath50 ,",
    "the optimum fragmentation functions are determined for the pions , kaons , and nucleons .",
    "it is especially important that the uncertainties of the obtained functions are calculated in this work .",
    "the results indicate large uncertainties at small @xmath1 , which suggests large ambiguities in extracting information , for example on nucleon spin and quark - hadron matters from hadron - production cross sections in lepton - hadron and hadron - hadron reactions .",
    "in such studies , it is important to indicate reliable regions of the fragmentation functions by using the uncertainties .",
    "we supply our code for calculating not only the optimum fragmentation functions but also their uncertainties at given @xmath2 and @xmath1 for general users @xcite .",
