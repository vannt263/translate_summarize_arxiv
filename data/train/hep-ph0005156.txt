    "the light quark masses , @xmath2 , @xmath5 , are among the least well determined of the fundamental parameters of the standard model and , as such , have been the subject of much recent attention , in both the qcd sum rule  @xcite and lattice  @xcite communities .",
    "recent attempts to extract @xmath5 and @xmath2 via sum rule analyses of , in the former case , the light quark ( @xmath6 ) pseudoscalar correlator@xcite , and in the latter case , the light - strange ( @xmath7 ) scalar@xcite or pseudoscalar@xcite correlators , suffer from the problem that the relevant spectral functions are not fully determined experimentally in the region required for the analyses .",
    "analyses based on vector current correlators involving various pieces of the light quark electromagnetic ( em ) current suffer from analogous problems . in the case of narison",
    "s sum rule based on the difference of the flavor @xmath8 ( isovector ) and @xmath9 ( hypercharge , or isoscalar ) correlators  @xcite , the @xmath10-parity - based identification of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 contributions to the em hadroproduction cross - section , which would allow the difference of @xmath8 and @xmath9 spectral functions to be determined from experimental data , is valid only in the absence of isospin breaking ( ib ) .",
    "the high degree of cancellation ( to the level of @xmath11 ) between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 spectral integrals makes the analysis rather sensitive to the neglect of ib  @xcite .",
    "this sensitivity is compounded by the fact that a sum rule determination of the corrections required to remove the @xmath12 contributions from the experimental data shows that , for reasons which are easily understood  @xcite , the dominant corrections , associated with the @xmath13 contribution to the nominal @xmath9 spectral function@xcite , are larger than one would naively expect .",
    "the central value @xmath14  @xcite , obtained neglecting ib corrections , is reduced to @xmath15 when one applies the ib corrections obtained in the sum rule analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the necessity of determining the ib corrections theoretically thus prevents one from working with a sum rule whose spectral side is determined solely by experimental data .    a similar problem exists for the sum rule based on the difference of @xmath8 and @xmath16 vector current correlators  @xcite , since the portion of the em hadroproduction cross - section associated with the @xmath16 part of the em spectral function is not an experimental observable . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is assumed to be given by the cross - section for the production of the various @xmath17 resonances .",
    "this approximation , while no doubt a reasonable one , is exactly valid only if both ( 1 ) the zweig rule is @xmath18 satisfied and ( 2 ) the @xmath17 resonances are all pure flavor @xmath19 states .",
    "the close cancellation ( to the @xmath20 level ) between the @xmath8 and @xmath16 spectral integrals again makes the analysis sensitive to even small ( few @xmath21 ) zweig rule violations ( zrv ) . to illustrate this sensitivity ,",
    "let us take the deviation from ideal mixing in the vector meson sector as a measure of the natural scale of zrv ,     from ref .",
    "@xcite one has that the vector meson mixing angle is either @xmath22 or @xmath23 , depending on whether one uses the linear or quadratic mass formula .    and consider a scenario in which zrv occurs dominantly in the mass matrix and not in the vacuum - to - vector - meson matrix elements of the vector currents .",
    "the strange ( light ) quark part of the em current then couples only to the strange ( light ) part of any given resonance .",
    "if the flavor content of a given @xmath17 resonance is @xmath24 ( with @xmath25 and @xmath26 small ) , the ratio of the square of the full em @xmath17 decay constant to that of the decay constant describing the coupling only to the @xmath16 part of the em current is then @xmath27 . for either the linear or quadratic versions of mixing this ratio is less than @xmath28 ; including zrv corrections will thus increase the @xmath16 spectral function and hence lower the extracted value of @xmath2 . taking , to be specific , the case that the radius of the circular part of the fesr contour is @xmath29 , we find that , using an identical method of analysis and identical higher dimensional condensate values to those employed in ref .  @xcite ( and including , for completeness , the small ib isovector contribution to the @xmath30 em decay constant determined in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the central value of @xmath31 obtained ignoring ib and zrv  @xcite ( @xmath32 ) is lowered to @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) for the linear ( quadratic ) cases , respectively .",
    "we stress that the point of this exercise is not to attempt a realistic estimate of zrv corrections but rather to point out that , given the scale at which such violations are already _ known _ to occur , the uncertainties in the extraction of @xmath2 associated with the neglect of zrv are large , and , moreover , can not be significantly reduced without a major improvement in our theoretical understanding of the precise nature and magnitude of zrv .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the agreement of the @xmath8-@xmath9 and @xmath8-@xmath16 determinations of @xmath2 obtained ignoring ib and zrv , respectively , was taken as evidence against the size of the ib corrections obtained in ref .",
    "note , however , that ( 1 ) within errors , the latter result is compatible with either the ib - corrected or uncorrected @xmath8-@xmath9 determination , and ( 2 ) two inverse moment sum rule determinations of the @xmath35 order chiral low - energy constant , @xmath36 , one based on the @xmath8-@xmath9  @xcite , and one on the @xmath37-@xmath8 correlator difference  @xcite , are brought into almost perfect agreement once the ib corrections of ref .",
    "@xcite are applied to the former analysis .    in light of the fact that , in each of the analyses above , it is not possible to work with sum rules for which the hadronic spectral function is determined entirely by experimental data , we will , in this paper , instead construct finite energy sum rules ( fesr s ) based on the flavor - breaking difference between the sum of the @xmath6 vector and axial vector correlators and the corresponding sum of @xmath7 correlators ,",

    "this separation is straightforward at low @xmath1 but experimentally problematic above @xmath82 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , an attempt was made to circumvent this problem by assuming the validity , even in the region of non - convergence , of a relation between the integrated longitudinal ope vector and axial vector @xmath78 contributions valid in the region of convergence of the ope representations of both .",
    "if true , this would allow the longitudinal strange axial integral to be obtained from the longitudinal strange vector integral .",
    "the latter can be obtained using the model strange scalar spectral function of ref .",
    "@xcite . using appropriately - weighted fesr s for the strange pseudoscalar channel",
    ", we have now been able to test this assumption , and demonstrate that it is , in fact , incorrect .",
    "our inability to treat the ope representation of the longitudinal contributions in a reliable manner thus creates difficult - to - quantify uncertainties for any fesr involving significant longitudinal spectral contributions .",
    "existing analyses are included in this category since , for example , the central value for the difference of non - strange and strange spectral integrals from the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath83 corresponds to @xmath69 , longitudinal and higher dimension condensate contributions which are @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "another practical problem is the close cancellation between the rescaled @xmath7 and @xmath6 spectral integrals for the sum rules above , based on the kinematic weights , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite , for example , the cancellation is to the @xmath87 level , making the results very sensitive to both small variations in the input parameters and the sizeable experimental errors ( @xmath88 ) on the strange decay number distribution above the @xmath89 region .",
    "two features of the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite illustrate the former sensitivity .",
    "first , refs .",
    "@xcite employ @xmath90 , _ c.f .",
    "_ the pdg98  @xcite value @xmath91 .",
    "though compatible within errors , the squares of the two central values differ by @xmath92 ; use of the pdg98 value _",
    "decreases _ the flavor - breaking difference , @xmath93 , by @xmath94 .",
    "since one can not reliably employ the ope representation of the longitudinal contributions , moreover , the longitudinal spectral contribution ( which is dominated , at the @xmath95 level , by the @xmath96 pole term ) must be subtracted ; the shift in the inferred @xmath69 contribution ( used to determine @xmath2 ) is thus even larger ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "similarly , use of the pdg98 value @xmath98 in place of the aleph determination , @xmath99 lowers the inferred @xmath69 contribution to @xmath93 by a further @xmath100 .",
    "the combined impact on the central value for @xmath2 is thus extremely large , though the two central values are , of course , compatible within the ( large ) errors quoted in refs .",
    "the _ relative _ size of the residual statistical errors as a fraction of the resulting @xmath93 is , of course , also significantly increased by such a decrease in @xmath93 .",
    "it is thus highly desirable to choose , in place of the kinematic weights , weights which produce a less close cancellation between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 spectral integrals .",
    "the easiest way to accomplish this goal is to choose weight functions which fall off more rapidly through the region of the excited strange resonances .",
    "this has the happy consequence of also suppressing contributions from the region where both the errors on the strange spectral distribution are large and the transverse / longitudinal separation is experimentally difficult .",
    "the final difficulty to be dealt with is theoretical .",
    "suppose we are able to solve the longitudinal / transverse separation problem , and thus work with fesr s involving only the @xmath69 part of the flavour breaking difference , @xmath101 the leading ( @xmath78 ) @xmath2-dependent terms in the ope representation of @xmath102 are  @xcite @xmath103_{d=2}&= & -{\\frac{3}{2\\pi}}{\\frac { m^2_s(q^2)}{q^2}}\\left [ 1+{\\frac{7}{3 } } a(q^2 ) + ( 19.9332 ) a(q^2)^2+\\cdots \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv &   -{\\frac{3}{2\\pi}}{\\frac { m^2_s(q^2)}{q^2}}\\sum_{k=0}g_k\\ , a(q^2)^k \\ , \\label{d2trans}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath104 and @xmath105 the running coupling and running strange quark mass , both at scale @xmath106 , in the @xmath107 scheme .",

    "( [ d2trans ] ) is rather large ( @xmath110 ) , signalling potentially slow convergence ( with @xmath111  @xcite , the ratio of the @xmath109 and @xmath108 terms is @xmath112 at @xmath113 , and @xmath114 for @xmath115 below @xmath116 . ) in recent analyses  @xcite , this potential problem is brought under ( apparent ) control using the method of `` contour improvement ''  @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the logarithms in @xmath102 are first summed ( as has already been done in eq .",

    "are significantly improved by this procedure  @xcite . since ,",
    "relative to an expansion in terms of @xmath124 , for some fixed scale @xmath115 , contour improvement represents a resummation of the perturbative series , it is possible that this improvement is physically meaningful .    unfortunately , it turns out that the apparent improvement is not a general one , but rather the result of an accidental suppression of the @xmath125 integral . to see this ,",
    "let us , for illustrative purposes , imagine that the unknown coefficients , @xmath126 , for @xmath127 , in eq .",

    "@xcite employ a form of the @xmath69 fesr in which the ope integral has been partially integrated once in order to re - express it in terms of the difference of @xmath69 @xmath6 and @xmath7 adler functions .",
    "the contour - improved series for the adler function version differs term - by - term from that based on the direct correlator difference .",
    "though the agreement of the sums of the two versions to second order is excellent , the reader should bear in mind that the relative size of the terms of different order is not the same in the two cases .",

    "the results of this exercise , rescaled in each case by the corresponding @xmath133 value , are displayed in table i. in columns 2 - 4 we see the apparently favorable convergence of the @xmath122 terms already discussed .",
    "the results of the remaining columns , however , show that the smallness of the @xmath125 term is not the result of a favorable resummation ( which would lead also to improved convergence for the remainder of the series ) but rather a consequence of the fact that @xmath129}_k(m_\\tau^2)$ ] has a zero as a function of @xmath123 rather close to @xmath125 .",
    "the magnitudes of the @xmath127 terms are such that truncation of the series at @xmath125 would produce a significant theoretical error , one much larger in magnitude than the size of the @xmath125 term .",
    "one should bear in mind that , were one to work with the adler function version of the @xmath69 fesr , the assumption of geometric growth of the coefficients of the adler function difference is not the same as the assumption of geometric growth of the coefficients of the correlator difference itself .",
    "the potential convergence problem , however , may also be demonstrated to exist in the former case .",
    "the contour improved analysis employing fesr s based on the spectral weights thus has potentially significant theoretical uncertainties .    in light of the problems discussed above for those fesr s based on the spectral weights , @xmath134 , our goal in the next section will be to construct alternate weights which lead to fesr s which bring these problems under control .",
    "we begin our search for an alternate choice of weight function by attempting to understand the source of the potential slow convergence of the contour - improved series noted above . the goal will be to find a weight such that , even were the unknown @xmath126 , @xmath127 , to grow geometrically , as assumed above , the tail of the contour - improved series would be small relative to the known terms , in contrast to the behavior shown in table i for the series corresponding to the spectral weights , @xmath134 .",
    "if we succeed in doing so , the reliability of the standard approach , in which the truncation error is taken to be given by the size of the last known term ( in this case , @xmath125 ) , will , of course , be improved regardless of the actual behavior of the unknown @xmath126 .",
    "we will then attempt to simultaneously impose conditions which reduce the impact of the experimental errors .    to study the source of the slow convergence of the contour - improved series , it is useful to consider the behavior of the factor @xmath135 , appearing in the integrand of @xmath136}_k(s_0)$ ] , on the contour @xmath118",
    ". let @xmath137 , @xmath138 , be any analytic function real on the real @xmath1 axis , and @xmath139 ( @xmath140 thus correspond to timelike and spacelike points , respectively ) .",

    "we observe that both @xmath142 and @xmath143 have zeroes on the circle @xmath145 , and that these zeroes move with the order @xmath123 . moreover , while @xmath146 ( slowly ) decreases with increasing @xmath123 for all angles @xmath17 , the magnitude of @xmath143 is sizeable in the region @xmath147 even for @xmath148 .",
    "this slow convergence in the backwards ( spacelike ) direction is the origin of the slow convergence of the @xmath127 tails of the integrated series shown in table i , since the factor @xmath149 entering the weight @xmath134 has maximum modulus at the spacelike point on the contour , and is more and more sharply peaked in the backward direction as @xmath150 increases .",
    "in addition , the behavior of @xmath151 and @xmath152 happens to be just such that , combined with the changes of sign of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath134 , there is a very strong cancellation in the integral over @xmath17 ( particularly so for the case @xmath153 ) .",
    "this strong cancellation is the origin of the `` accidental '' suppression of the magnitude of the @xmath125 term .",
    "as we have already seen in table i , it is potentially dangerous to use weights for which the integrals @xmath154}_k(s_0)$ ] are small for a particular @xmath123 ( or for a small number of values of @xmath123 ) _ only due to such cancellations_. higher order contributions can then easily be large again , thereby spoiling the seemingly good convergence of the first few terms of the contour - improved series .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath142 and @xmath143 displayed in figure 1 allows one not only to understand the origin of the potential convergence problem but also to construct alternate sum rules which avoid it . from figure 1",
    "it is evident that convergence can be improved by avoiding weights which are large in the spacelike direction .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite also indicate that , for the fesr framework to be reliable at scales @xmath155 , it is necessary for the weight function to have a zero at @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "such a zero suppresses contributions from the ope representation in the region near the timelike real axis where , at scales @xmath155 and below , data shows that it breaks down  @xcite .",
    "we have found two approaches useful for implementing these constraints .",
    "the first involves the use of polynomials with `` shepherd '' zeros , i.e. , zeros either on , or near , the regions of the contour one wishes to suppress .",
    "the second involves the construction of weights , @xmath158 , with @xmath159 peaked on the contour at angles @xmath160 , thereby avoiding large contributions from @xmath143 , @xmath161 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "a convenient and effective choice is to take @xmath159 to have a gaussian form on the contour . choosing the width of the gaussian to be @xmath162 and the center to be @xmath163",
    ", good convergence of the @xmath127 tail of the integrated series can be obtained for any @xmath164 .",
    "technically , these profiles can be well represented using polynomials of degree @xmath165 @xmath166 the coefficients @xmath167 are determined , upon normalizing @xmath159 such that @xmath168 , by the fourier integrals @xmath169    to summarize : given the problems discussed above with those fesr s involving the spectral weights , @xmath170 , we would like to find , if possible , an alternate weight choice , @xmath137 ,    \\(1 ) such that @xmath137 is strongly suppressed in the region above @xmath171 , in order to ( a ) reduce the degree of cancellation between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 spectral integrals , ( b ) reduce the impact of the large experimental errors in the @xmath7 spectral distribution above the @xmath89 region , and ( c ) minimize the role of the longitudinal subtraction which must , at present , be performed theoretically ; and    \\(2 ) such that @xmath137 emphasizes those regions of the contour @xmath118 for which the convergence of the @xmath78 series is favorable .    it is , of course , not _ a priori _ obvious that there exist @xmath137 having the desired properties .",
    "we have , however , succeeded in constructing several polynomial weights which do .",
    "an important further restriction results from the observation that , in the fesr framework , higher dimension contributions are suppressed only by inverse powers of @xmath45 ; in order to avoid generating potentially large , and unknown , higher dimension contributions , therefore , the coefficients of the polynomials we construct should all be comparable in magnitude to the leading coefficient , @xmath172 .",
    "we have chosen to implement this constraint by keeping all coefficients less than @xmath173 in magnitude .    since , as we will see below ,",

    "as noted above , the weights have been chosen in such a way that , although theoretical input is required in order to subtract the longitudinal contributions to the experimental number distributions , and hence obtain the @xmath69 spectral functions , the effect of this subtraction on the final value of @xmath2 is negligible .",
    "we will quantify this statement below .",
    "once the @xmath69 spectral function has been determined , it is a straightforward matter to evaluate the weighted @xmath69 spectral integrals .",
    "the choice of steeply falling weights ensures that the strange spectral integrals are dominated by the @xmath96 and @xmath89 contributions , for which the experimental errors are much smaller than those of the rest of the strange number distribution .",
    "this plays a major role in reducing the impact of experimental errors on the final extracted value of @xmath2 . to get a realistic determination of these errors",
    "it is important to separate correlated and uncorrelated errors , and also to take into account the strong correlations between the spectral integrals involving different weights .",
    "the nature of the longitudinal subtraction differs significantly in the low-@xmath1 and high-@xmath1 ( @xmath200 ) regions . for low @xmath1 , the @xmath201 and @xmath96 pole subtractions are experimentally unambiguous . for high @xmath1 ( the resonance region ) ,",
    "the longitudinal contributions are proportional to @xmath202 , @xmath203 , for @xmath7 , @xmath6 , respectively , and hence dominated by the @xmath7 contributions .",
    "the longitudinal @xmath7 vector contribution is inferred from the strange scalar spectral function of ref .",
    "this procedure is consistent provided the value of @xmath2 resulting from the present analysis is compatible with that from the strange scalar channel  @xcite , which it turns out to be .",
    "the longitudinal @xmath7 axial vector contribution is similarly inferred from the spectral function of the strange pseudoscalar channel .",
    "the latter is obtained by fixing the excited resonance decay constants of a sum - of - resonances spectral ansatz through matching of the hadronic and ope sides of a family of `` pinch - weighted '' fesr s , in analogy to the analysis of ref  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding procedure works very well in the isovector vector channel , where the results can be checked against the well - known experimental spectral function  @xcite .",
    "a similar statement is true even in channels with strongly attractive interactions near threshold , for which the spectral function will be poorly represented _ near threshold _ by the tail of a breit - wigner resonance form with `` conventional '' @xmath1-dependent width .",
    "for example , using the value of @xmath2 obtained from the strange scalar channel analysis as input and redoing the strange scalar channel analysis , using now a sum - of - resonances spectral ansatz in place of the more realistic ansatz of ref .",
    "@xcite , one finds that the ansatz of ref .",
    "@xcite is well - reproduced in the region of the dominant @xmath204 peak .",
    "one can also use this approach to check the self - consistency between the assumed longitudinal contributions and the output @xmath2 value in kinematic - weight - based analysis of ref .",
    "it turns out that the high-@xmath1 longitudinal contributions assumed are more than a factor of @xmath205 smaller than would be expected based on the extracted value of @xmath2 .",
    "if one employs the pdg98 values for @xmath199 and @xmath196 , as discussed above , however , the assumed longitudinal contribution becomes compatible within the errors assigned to it in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the input value of @xmath2 required for this analysis should , in principle , be determined iteratively .",

    "@xcite , @xmath206 .",
    "this turns out to be consistent with our final result for @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , for the steeply - falling weights employed in our analysis , the sum of the high-@xmath1 @xmath207 and @xmath208 longitudinal subtractions is at the @xmath209 level of the @xmath7 spectral integral , and hence at the @xmath210 level in the @xmath6-@xmath7 difference . as such , even were our evaluation to be in error by @xmath18 , the effect on @xmath2 would be completely negligible on the scale of the other errors present in the analysis .",

    "as noted above , the ope contour integrals ( for all @xmath228 ) are performed using the contour improvement prescription .",
    "four - loop versions of the running mass and coupling are employed . to be specific , we have solved analytically for the running mass and coupling using the 4-loop truncated versions of the @xmath26  @xcite and @xmath229  @xcite functions , with the value determined in nonstrange hadronic @xmath0 decays , @xmath230  @xcite , as input . following conventional practice , we take the error associated with the truncation of the perturbative series for the wilson coefficient of the @xmath78 term at @xmath109 to be equal to the value of the last ( @xmath109 ) contribution retained . in light of the discussion above we consider this to represent an extremely conservative estimate .    from the point of view of uncertainties on the ope side , the @xmath191 sum rule",
    "is favored over the @xmath192 and @xmath193 sum rules for three reasons : ( 1 ) it has no @xmath177 contributions , ( 2 ) it has the smallest truncation error , and ( 3 ) it has the smallest errors associated with uncertainties in the input values of the @xmath212 and @xmath221 condensates .    combining the errors associated with truncation , the condensate input values , and the uncertainty on @xmath231 in quadrature , the resulting errors on @xmath2 are @xmath232 , @xmath233 and @xmath234 for @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 , respectively .    in table",
    "iii we display , as a function of @xmath45 , the extracted values of @xmath235 obtained from the @xmath191 sum rule , analyzed neglecting contributions of dimension 12 and higher .",
    "central values have been used for all input on the ope side and for the experimental spectral data . for the analysis to be self - consistent , the extracted value of @xmath2 should be independent of @xmath45",
    ". this will be true for @xmath45 sufficiently large that the @xmath236 contributions are negligible .",
    "as @xmath45 is decreased , the extracted @xmath2 values should eventually deviate from a constant , signalling the growth of the higher dimension terms . from the table",
    "we see that the range @xmath237 provides an extremely good window of stability . in view of the falloff begining around @xmath238",
    ", we will work in the range @xmath239 in the discussions which follow .",
    "it is worth stressing that the central values obtained from @xmath193 and @xmath192 sum rules , though having slightly larger theoretical errors , are nonetheless completely consistent with those above : in the window @xmath240 , one finds that the range of solutions for @xmath241 lies between @xmath242 and @xmath243 for @xmath193 , @xmath244 and @xmath245 for @xmath192 , and , as we saw already in table iii , @xmath246 and @xmath247 for @xmath191 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath66 sum rule , for which the longitudinal subtraction is important , and the @xmath78 convergence is not well under control , yields a range between @xmath248 and @xmath249 ( with , moreover , inconsistent solutions for @xmath227 )",
    ".    from the point of view of the impact of the errors present in existing experimental data , the theoretically favored @xmath191 weight is , unfortunately , no longer the favored one .",
    "the reason is that , although the impact of the errors in the high-@xmath1 region of the @xmath7 spectrum has been strongly suppressed by the rapid falloff of the weights employed , the @xmath6-@xmath7 cancellation is still rather close ( _ e.g. _ , at @xmath81 , to the level of @xmath250 for @xmath191 , @xmath251 for @xmath192 and @xmath252 for @xmath193 , to be compared with @xmath253 , @xmath254 and @xmath255 for the @xmath134 , @xmath132 . )",
    "although the dominant errors ( those from the @xmath89 region of the @xmath7 spectrum ) are reasonably small , they are still large enough that the _ relative _ size of the residual statistical error grows very rapidly with the increase in the degree of cancellation . thus , _ e.g. _ , at @xmath81 , the statistical error represents @xmath256 , @xmath97 , @xmath257 , @xmath258 , @xmath259 and @xmath260 of the @xmath6-@xmath7 spectral difference for the @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath261 , @xmath262 , and @xmath263 sum rules , respectively .",
    "because of the high degree of cancellation , reducing @xmath45 , which increases the degree of suppression of the ( already small ) high-@xmath1 @xmath7 contributions , still has a non - trivial effect ; _ e.g. _ , the relative statistical error for the @xmath193 sum rule is reduced from @xmath257 to @xmath264 when @xmath45 is lowered from @xmath80 to @xmath265 .      working with the @xmath193 sum rule in the window specified above",
    "we find , for our best fit , @xmath266 which is equivalent to @xmath267 where in both of eqs .",
    "( [ finalms ] ) and ( [ otherfinalms ] ) the first error is statistical , the second is due to the uncertainty on @xmath199 , and the third theoretical .",
    "the theoretical error has been obtained by combining the following in quadrature ( where we quote the numerical values corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ finalms ] ) to be specific ) : @xmath268 , associated with the error on @xmath269 ; @xmath270 , associated with the uncertainty in @xmath271 ; @xmath272 , associated with the variation of @xmath2 within the window @xmath273 ; @xmath274 , associated with the uncertainty in the vsa - violating parameter , @xmath223 ; and @xmath275 , associated with truncation of the @xmath78 series .",
    "the latter obviously remains the dominant source of theoretical error , despite the significant improvement produced by the use of the new weights .",
    "figure 2 displays the quality of the match between the ope and spectral integral sides of the @xmath193 sum rule corresponding to the fit above ; the agreement in the previously - established stability window , @xmath276 , is obviously excellent .",
    "the divergence of the ope and spectral integral curves below @xmath238 is precisely what one would expect based on the observation above that , for the @xmath191 sum rule , @xmath277 contributions , not included in the truncated ope representation , begin to become important in this region .    the result of eqs .",
