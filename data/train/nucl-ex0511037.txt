    "<S> recent experimental observations on the ` bulk ' features of particle production at high ( pseudo)rapidities will be reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> this kinematic region is of interest mostly because of its relevance to the theoretical description of initial state effects of nuclei at ultra - relativistic energies . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the charged hadron multiplicity density as well as the pseudorapidity dependence of the elliptic and directed flow exhibit a remarkable scaling property as a function of collision energy . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling seems to hold for pions and even photons and j/@xmath0-s , but is violated for protons . </S>",
    "<S> the special role of baryons will be discussed using selected results on nuclear transparency and baryon stopping . </S>"
