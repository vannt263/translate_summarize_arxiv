    "multi - dimensional ( multi - d ) radiative transfer ( rt ) is important to advance our understanding of the solar atmosphere . with the increase in the resolving power of modern telescopes , and the computing power of supercomputers ,",

    "i we presented a method of stokes vector decomposition , which helped to formulate an ` irreducible form ' of the polarized line transfer equation in a 3d cartesian geometry .",
    "such a formulation is advantageous because , the source vector and the mean intensity vector become angle independent in the reduced basis . also the scattering phase matrix becomes independent of the outgoing directions ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this property leads to several advantages in numerical work .",
    "it also provides a framework in which the transfer equation can be solved more conveniently , because the decomposition is applied to both the stokes source vector , and the stokes intensity vector . in (",

    "i and paper ii we considered the case of non - magnetic resonance scattering polarization . @xcite and @xcite solved the polarized rt equation in the presence of a magnetic field ( hanle effect ) , in multi - d media .",
    "their calculations used the assumption of complete frequency redistribution ( crd ) in line scattering . in this paper",
    "we solve the same problem , but for the more difficult and more realistic case of hanle scattering with prd .",
    "the physics of prd scattering is treated using the frequency - domain based approach developed by @xcite .",

    "the intensities reach saturation values in the interiors of the top surface and drop to zero at two of the visible boundaries ( where a boundary condition of zero intensity is imposed for our chosen ray emerging at the top surface ) .",
    "in figures  [ fig - surface - thread](b ) and ( c ) we see that @xmath226 and @xmath224 take values @xmath263% everywhere on the top surface .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath226 and @xmath224 for this case are relatively less than those for the semi - infinite 3d atmospheres ( compare with figure  [ fig - surface ] ) .",
    "this can be understood using the following arguments .",
    "we are showing the results for a ray with @xmath264 emerging from the top surface .",
    "the top surface for this figure refers to @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the optical depth measured inwards in the @xmath7 direction . using equations given in appendix  [ appendixa ] we can write approximate expressions for @xmath15 and @xmath16 at the top surface as @xmath267    @xmath268    @xmath101 is controlled by the element @xmath269 ( see appendix  [ appendixd ] ) which appears in the scattering integral for @xmath107 .",
    "the factor @xmath269 represents the probability of scattering of photons incident from the direction @xmath25 . for @xmath270 or @xmath271 ( vertical incidence )",
    "@xmath198 is larger in magnitude compared to the cases @xmath272 or @xmath273 ( lateral incidence ) .",
    "for @xmath258 the medium is effectively optically thin ( because @xmath274 ) in the @xmath7 direction , and therefore photons easily escape in this direction .",
    "thus there are smaller number of photons for incidence along the vertical direction when compared to the effectively thick case . for @xmath260 or @xmath275",
    "the medium is effectively optically thick ( because @xmath276 ) in the @xmath7 direction and therefore leaking of photons in this direction is reduced when compared to the case of @xmath258 . in this way , for large values of @xmath167 the probability of photons to be incident in the vertical direction is large .",
    "therefore , as @xmath167 increases the values of @xmath101 and hence @xmath226 increase .    for the chosen line of sight , stokes @xmath16 is generated mainly by @xmath194 and @xmath277 .",
    "they are controlled by @xmath206 and @xmath201 elements ( see appendix  [ appendixd ] ) both of which depend on the factor @xmath278 .",
    "this implies that @xmath206 and @xmath201 are zero for both vertical and lateral incidence of photons .",
    "these elements become larger when the incidence is predominant in the direction of @xmath279 or @xmath280 . using similar arguments as above we can understand the increase in the values of @xmath224 with increasing values of @xmath167 .",
    "the spatial distribution of @xmath226 and @xmath224 is inhomogeneous in both left and right panels for the chosen core frequencies , in contrast to the homogeneous distribution observed for semi - infinite 3d atmospheres .",
    "the extent of inhomogenity is larger for the left panels which correspond to smaller @xmath167 value than for the right panels .",
    "the spatial inhomogenity could also occur due to different optical thicknesses along the 3 spatial directions leading to different number of scatterings in the 3 directions ( unlike the case of figure  [ fig - surface ] where @xmath281 ) .",
    "in other words , the inhomogeneities in @xmath226 and @xmath224 can also be caused by a differential leaking of radiation in the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions .",

    "thirdly , we use the more efficient 2d and 3d short characteristics formal solutions , with appropriate generalizations to the present context . with the linear formal solver used in paper i , practically it is difficult to compute the solutions in semi - infinite media .",

    "the differences between the emergent , spatially averaged @xmath3 profiles in 2d and 3d media are negligible in @xmath226 , but noticeable in @xmath224 .    in the non - magnetic case , at line center , the spatial distribution of @xmath226 and @xmath224 is homogeneous in the interior of the top surface , but sharply raise near the edges .",
    "this is purely a multi - d geometric effect .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field modifies this distribution by causing a depolarization ( decrease in the magnitude ) or re - polarization ( increase in the magnitude ) of @xmath226 and @xmath224 .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the hanle effect . in the line wing frequencies , magnetic and non - magnetic spatial distributions",

    "<S> in the previous two papers , namely , @xcite and @xcite we solved the polarized radiative transfer ( rt ) equation in multi - dimensional ( multi - d ) geometries , with partial frequency redistribution ( prd ) as the scattering mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we assumed rayleigh scattering as the only source of linear polarization ( @xmath0 ) in both these papers . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we extend these previous works to include the effect of weak oriented magnetic fields ( hanle effect ) on line scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we generalize the technique of stokes vector decomposition in terms of the irreducible spherical tensors @xmath1 , developed in @xcite , to the case of rt with hanle effect </S>",
    "<S> . a fast iterative method of solution ( based on the stabilized preconditioned bi - conjugate - gradient technique ) , developed in @xcite , is now generalized to the case of rt in magnetized three - dimensional media . </S>",
    "<S> we use the efficient short - characteristics formal solution method for multi - d media , generalized appropriately to the present context . </S>",
    "<S> the main results of this paper are the following : ( 1 ) a comparison of emergent @xmath2 profiles formed in one - dimensional ( 1d ) media , with the corresponding emergent , spatially averaged profiles formed in multi - d media , shows that in the spatially resolved structures , the assumption of 1d may lead to large errors in linear polarization , especially in the line wings . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the multi - d rt in semi - infinite non - magnetic media causes a strong spatial variation of the emergent @xmath3 profiles , which is more pronounced in the line wings . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) the presence of a weak magnetic field modifies the spatial variation of the emergent @xmath3 profiles in the line core , by producing significant changes in their magnitudes . </S>"
