    "the positive solution of the yamabe problem @xcite tells us that if @xmath1 is a compact smooth manifold ( without boundary ) , then every conformal class @xmath2 of riemannian metrics on @xmath1 contains a metric ( known as a yamabe metric ) of constant scalar curvature with the following special property .",
    "its scalar curvature is the infimum of the scalar curvature @xmath3 , taken over all metrics in @xmath2 with constant scalar curvature and total volume @xmath4 .",
    "the value of this scalar curvature is called the yamabe constant @xmath5 of @xmath2 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath5 can be defined to be the minimum over metrics @xmath6 of the einstein - hilbert functional @xmath7 it is therefore natural to to ask if there is a `` best '' yamabe metric , and if so what its scalar curvature is . that motivates the following definition from @xcite .",
    "the yamabe invariant of @xmath1 is defined by @xmath8 this supremum is not always attained , so the answer to the question about whether @xmath1 has a `` best '' metric of constant scalar curvature might be `` no . ''",
    "the best that is known that there are singular metrics ( with singularities at a finite number of points ) which serve as the `` best '' approximation to an einstein metric on @xmath1 .    nevertheless , @xmath9 is a diffeomophism invariant of @xmath1 .",
    "it also turns out that @xmath10 if and only if @xmath1 admits a metric of positive scalar curvature , a much - studied condition ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xmath11 is possible even when @xmath1 admits no scalar - flat metric .    in dimension",

    "similarly , there is a conjectural connection between @xmath9 and `` geometrization '' when @xmath16 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "but even when @xmath16 , and especially when @xmath17 , it is not yet known if there are * any * manifolds with @xmath18 .",
    "( the obvious candidates for such manifolds are hyperbolic manifolds , but for all we know they could have vanishing yamabe invariant . ) in fact , petean @xcite has proved that @xmath19 for any simply connected manifold of dimension at least @xmath20 .    in this paper",

    ", we show that it is enough to study the case when @xmath21 is a finite abelian @xmath24-group . the central objects to understand here are the bordism groups @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and the proof amounts to the fact that all elements of these bordism groups may be represented by manifolds with nonnegative yamabe invariant .",
    "a computation of these groups is quite hard , and the actual answer is known only for elementary abelian groups of odd order and few other cases ( see @xcite ) .",
    "instead we use the knneth formula to build manifolds with nonnegative yamabe invariant to represent generators of these bordism groups .",
    "there are two types of `` building blocks '' : tensor products ( which are realized by direct products of manifolds ) and torsion products ( which geometrically are just toda brackets ) .",
    "we recall that toda bracket @xmath27 is defined when @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "then the manifold @xmath30 represents the toda bracket @xmath27 .    as usual , to prove new geometric results we have to employ some _ new geometric techniques_. roughly , we show ( under some restrictions ) that if @xmath9 and @xmath31 are @xmath32 ( resp . , @xmath33 )",

    "then @xmath1 has a metric of positive scalar curvature .    to put these results in context , it s worth recalling what is known about positive scalar curvature for manifolds with finite fundamental group . for such manifolds ( of dimension @xmath0 )",

    "in fact in @xcite , it was conjectured ( on the basis of extremely spotty evidence ) that the index theory of the dirac operator provides the only obstructions to positive scalar curvature on manifolds of dimension @xmath0 with finite fundamental group .",
    "this conjecture has sometimes been called the gromov - lawson - rosenberg conjecture . however",
    ", the `` stable '' theorem by itself does not actually answer the question of whether any _ particular _ manifold with vanishing dirac obstructions admits a metric of positive scalar curvature .",
    "it _ is _ known @xcite that for spin manifolds of dimension @xmath0 with finite fundamental group with periodic cohomology , the dirac obstructions are the only obstructions to positive scalar curvature .",
    "a similar theorem was proved by schultz @xcite , and independently by botvinnik and gilkey @xcite , for spin manifolds of dimension @xmath0 with fundamental group @xmath37 , @xmath24 an odd prime .",
    "but very little was previously known about positive scalar curvature for manifolds with elementary abelian fundamental group of rank @xmath38 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : thmb ] is based on a reduction to the results of @xcite , again using toda brackets .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",

    "the proof of this fact is based on the following _ surgery theorem _ :    [ thm : surgery]if @xmath1 is a closed manifold with connected components @xmath42 , and if another closed connected manifold @xmath43 can be obtained from @xmath1 by surgeries in codimension @xmath44 , and if @xmath45 for each @xmath46 , then @xmath47 .",
    "this is really three theorems in one .",
    "if @xmath48 for all @xmath46 , then @xmath1 admits a metric of positive scalar curvature , hence so does @xmath43 , by the surgery theorem of gromov - lawson and schoen - yau ( @xcite and @xcite  some of the details are carefully redone in theorem 3.1 of @xcite ) , and so @xmath49 . if @xmath1 is disconnected and @xmath50 for some components and @xmath51 for other components , then we may first replace @xmath1 by the connected sum of its components , which has @xmath52 by iterated application of case ( b ) of @xcite , theorem 1 .",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "this reduces us to the case where @xmath1 is connected .",
    "if @xmath1 is connected and @xmath53 , then the corollary to theorem 1 of @xcite says @xmath54 , so if @xmath9 is exactly @xmath15 , @xmath47 .",
    "in this paper we will discuss what can be learned about the yamabe invariant  for non - simply connected manifolds , using theorem [ thm : surgery ] .",
    "many of the basic facts about manifolds of positive scalar curvature , which are proved using the surgery theorem of gromov - lawson and schoen - yau , have obvious counterparts for manifolds with nonnegative yamabe invariant , obtained by substituting theorem [ thm : surgery ] in the proof .",
    "the proofs are almost identical to those in the positive scalar curvature  case , so while we will give complete statements of the results , we will be brief when it comes to details of the proofs .",
    "first we need to convert the surgery theorem , theorem [ thm : surgery ] , to a bordism theorem .",
