    "an external magnetic field enters a ( type ii ) superconductor as a collection of quantized magnetic flux tubes .",
    "the flux tubes with associated supercurrent vortices form a triangular lattice @xcite as is seen in conventional superconductors @xcite .",
    "deviations from this structure are of considerable interest . in conventional superconductors ,",
    "the observed deviations have been attributed to the anisotropy of the underlying one electron energy spectrum . in heavy fermion and high t@xmath12 superconductors ,",
    "an additional and potentially very interesting reason is the existence of an unconventional superconducting order parameter , with gaps which have nodes and change sign .",
    "indeed there is experimental evidence both in heavy fermion systems @xcite the exotic superconductor srruo@xmath13 @xcite and in cuprate superconductors @xcitethat the vortex lattice is not triangular ( for some field and temperature regimes ) .",
    "recently , measurements of small angle neutron diffraction from untwinned yba@xmath14cu@xmath15o@xmath16 single crystals shows a very well formed triangular lattice that undergoes an orientational transition from along @xmath8 axis to along @xmath17 axis for a @xmath18 magnetic field at @xmath19 to the @xmath2-axis@xcite . the reasons for possible nontriangular structure as well as for the structural transition are not fully established , and are the subject of considerable theoretical work @xcite .",
    "in high t@xmath12 superconductors , entropic effects , abetted by high transition temperature as well as weak interlayer coupling play an important role , and the classical statistical mechanics of interacting , meandering flux lines , of the vortex fluid phase , and the solid fluid transition has developed into a major theoretical and experimental subfield @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the nature of the flux lattice at temperatures well below the superconducting transition , where vortex configurational entropy effects mentioned above are negligible .",
    "the ground state structures and structural transition then directly reflect the electronic peculiarities of the superconductor , and thus probe the latter . for cuprate superconductors ,",
    "a number of measurements show that the superconducting gap @xmath20 has nodes @xcite , has a magnitude with a @xmath21 dependence on the two dimensional wave vector @xmath22 across the fermi surface @xcite and that transport lifetimes of quasiparticles are long @xcite for @xmath23 . thus one can assume well defined low energy , nodal quasiparticles , with an experimentally determined one electron dispersion @xmath24 @xcite and gap function @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the question of interest is the effect of the zero gap , anisotropic dirac like linear quasiparticle excitation spectrum on the interaction between vortices , and thus on vortex lattice structure .",
    "there is considerable evidence e.g. , from magnetic field dependent electronic specific heat @xcite , electronic thermal conductivity @xcite , and superfluid density @xcite measurements that an external magnetic field going in as vortices has a strong effect on electronic states , changing their density and lifetime .",
    "the relevant issue here is somewhat the reverse , namely the effect of the quasiparticles on interaction between vortices .",
    "the order parameter phase associated with the vortex , and the related magnetic vector potential together constitute the superfluid velocity field @xmath26 $ ] where the vortices are located at points @xmath27 .",
    "the extra superfluid kinetic energy , being quadratic in @xmath28 , clearly has a part that depends on two vortex coordinates and is thus structure sensitive .",
    "in addition to this ` diamagnetic ' term , which is the additional kinetic energy of the rigidly moving superfluid and which is minimized for a triangular lattice [ 1 ] , there is another ` paramagnetic ' term due to the perturbation of quasiparticles by the superfluid current via the term @xmath29 .",
    "this causes virtual particle hole excitations ; two vortices interact via the exchange of quasiparticle quasihole pairs .",
    "this polarization term depends on the quasiparticle excitation spectrum . in a clean @xmath30-wave superconductor",
    ", the process leads to an additional isotropic interaction between vortices of order @xmath31 relative to the diamagnetic term .",
    "however , in a @xmath32-wave superconductor where the excitation gap vanishes along some ( nodal ) directions , one expects the nonlocal polarizeability to be larger as well as anisotropic ; this gives rise to an interaction between vortices which depends on the orientation of the line joining them with the respect to crystaline axes , and consequently can be the cause of novel long range positional order .",
    "the ground state energy arising from quasiparticle / hole mediated interaction between vortices depends linearly on the nonlocal current susceptibility @xmath33 , for wave vectors @xmath34 equal to the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath35 of the vortex lattice .",
    "because the gap as well as density of quasiparticle states vanish linearly near the node , @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath36 or @xmath37 for small @xmath38 .",
    "this nonanalytic behaviour , noticed first by kosztin and leggett @xcite , has also been discussed by franz et al @xcite who were the first to analyze microscopically its effect , as well as of the anisotropy in @xmath39 , on vortex lattice structure at @xmath40 .",
    "these authors found a rich phase diagram in the field temperature plane , with a centered rectangular lattice at @xmath40 whose inner angle varies _ continuously _ as a function of field , as well as a sudden orientational transition at higher temperatures , and a transition to a centered square lattice for very high fields and low @xmath41 . in obtaining these results ,",
    "franz et al made a ",
    "local \" approximation for the gap function , i.e. , assumed @xmath42 , and more importantly they assumed a momentum independent quasiparticle current which leads to a response function @xmath43 .",
    "the anisotropy then enters only through @xmath44 .",
    "we carry out here a more detailed and realistic calculation of the nonlocal susceptibility , considering the strong @xmath22 dependence of the gap function @xmath25 and quasiparticle current @xmath45 properly , and using a realistic one electron dispersion .",
    "the diagonal terms @xmath46 and @xmath47 are unequal and large , and this anisotropy is seen to be the underlying cause of the transition .",
    "the contibution of the off diagonal susceptitiblity @xmath48 is smaller than that of the diagonal susceptibilities .",
    "our results for structural stability ( at @xmath40 ) are therefore quite different from those of franz et al @xcite .",
    "confining ourselves to @xmath40 , we find , as summarized in a phase diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ phase_n ] ) , that the stable lattice at low fields is triangular . at about 5 tesla ( for the parameters chosen ) the orientation of the smallest @xmath35 vector changes from being along one of the axes to being along the order parameter node direction , because the system is most susceptible to excitations with wave vector along the node .",
    "we have analyzed the driving force for this transition , both analytically and numerically , and find that it arises from a subtle balance between the term linear in @xmath49 and the quadratic term , which are slightly different for the two orientations .",
    "the field scale for the transition is approximately given by the condition @xmath50 which is natural on dimensional grounds .",
    "the fermi velocity is @xmath51 and the energy scale associated with the superflow @xmath52 with fourier component @xmath53 is therefore @xmath54 .",
    "the polarizability or susceptibility has an energy scale @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the gap magnitude which sets the scale for quasiparticle excitation energies .",
    "thus the dimensionless susceptibility of interest is @xmath57 . for realistic parameters @xmath58 , and @xmath56",
    "this translates @xmath59 $ ] to a field scale of 5.2 t .",
    "we find that the node oriented triangular lattice is stable till about 28 t , whereupon a discontinuous transition to a centered square lattice takes place .",
    "this structure , which is orientationally commensurate with the symmetry of the quasiparticle dispersion , is probably the most stable @xmath40 phase when electronic commensurate effects dominate .",
    "however , the calculated field scale is large enough that the london approximation used , valid for @xmath60 , is not reliable , because vortex core effects can not be neglected at these high fields .    in the next section ( section ii )",
    ", we describe the model and the theoretical approach used .",
    "the tight binding quasiparticle hamiltonian is decomposed into an unperturbed part @xmath61 and a term @xmath62 due to the quasiparticle vortex interaction . the free energy or the ground state energy can be obtained as a power series in @xmath62 or equivalently the density of vortices . for low vortex densities",
    "@xmath63 the leading or @xmath64 term is sufficient , and describes quasiparticle - hole mediated vortex interaction , in addition to the bare superfluid kinetic energy .",
    "we discuss the former carefully in terms of the nonlocal , anisotropic current susceptibility @xmath65 since the energy can be expressed as a reciprocal lattice vector sum over @xmath66 .",
    "we obtain @xmath65 semianalytically for small @xmath38 at @xmath40 , as well as numerically ( section iii ) .",
    "the calculations for different two dimensional structures are discussed in section iii . for a given magnetic field @xmath1 the most general centered rectangular lattice [ @xmath67 can be described in terms of an angle @xmath68 related to the aspect ratio @xmath69 as @xmath70 , and an orientation @xmath71 with respect to crystal axes ( fig .",
    "[ lat_n ] ) .",
    "we compute the ground state energy as a function of these two variables for different magnetic fields .",
    "the basic vortex related electronic energy parameters are the following .",
    "the vortex has three energy scales , namely the diamagnetic single vortex energy , of order 3450@xmath11 per vortex , the vortex interaction energy , the diamagnetic part of which has a value @xmath72 ( for nearest neighbor vortices ) , and the paramagnetic interaction term which is about @xmath73 at 5 t field .",
    "the last , and the smallest term is structure sensitive and is of interest here .",
    "the ground state is analyzed as a function of @xmath68 , @xmath71 for several field values in section iii .",
    "it turns out that the structure sensitive part of the last ( paramagnetic vortex interaction ) term is extremely small , of order a few degrees per vortex .",
    "this has obvious implications for the observability of the transition , because the structural changes predicted and the clean limit anisotropies obtained can be easily overwhelmed by effects of disorder , eg . ,",
    "vortex pinning and the muting of the paramagnetic susceptibility anisotropy , and nonanalyticity by disorder .",
    "however , the size of the structure sensitive terms is larger , the greater the @xmath74 ratio or anisotropy .",
    "one can thus imagine situations where this effect is quite large .    in the concluding section ( section iv )",
    "we briefly discuss thermal effects , the consequence of the predicted transition and their observability , the reason for which our result doffers from earlier , and the experimentally observed structural transitions .",
    "we consider a two dimensional lattice model with nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor hopping for a cuo@xmath14 plane of high @xmath75 superconductors . the ( mean field )",
    "hamiltonian in this model is given by @xmath76 where @xmath7 and @xmath77 are nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor hopping integrals respectively .",

    ", the magnetic field goes into the system in the form of vortices .",

    "the pair amplitude acquires a phase : @xmath84 $ ] , where @xmath85 is the sum of polar angles of all the vortices measured with respect to a particular axis , for the centre of mass of the pair @xmath86 .",

    "i.e. , with intervortex spacing @xmath91 , or the london limit , we assume the order parameter magnitude be uniform , throughout the superconductor ( there are @xmath92 function sources of phase rotation at the locations of vortices ) . there is a vector potential @xmath93 such that @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the local magnetic induction , along the @xmath2-axis .",

    "they however differ for higher @xmath229 since our analytical expressions are not consistent in determining quadratic dependences on @xmath38 as we have neglected higher order @xmath145 dependences to quasiparticle energy .",

    "the orientational transition takes place when the ratio is unity .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath293 .",
    "therefore the critical field at which the transition take place , @xmath294 .",
    "the structure of the vortex lattice remains triangular with @xmath275 orientation to the crystal lattice as we have shown @xmath265 in fig .",
    "[ fe_h25 ] for a field as high as @xmath295 tesla .",
    "however , it makes yet another discontinuous structural transition to a centered square lattice with its axes parallel to the crystal axes at yet another critical field @xmath296 whose value is about 28 tesla .",
    "figure [ fe_h28 ] shows that @xmath265 is minimum for @xmath259 and @xmath280 at @xmath297 tesla . the overall phase diagram for the ground state of the vortex lattice structure at @xmath40",
    "is shown in figure [ phase_n ] .",
    "we conclude by briefly discussing a number of questions such as the nature of the approximations used , the effect of nonzero temperature , consequences of the transitions , their observability , the reason why our conclusions differ from those found earlier , and the structural transitions experimentally observed .    we have calculated the ground state energy assuming effectively that the interaction between two vortices is unaffected by the presence of other vortices .",
    "this is obviously a low vortex density approximation which seems quite reasonable since the dimensionless ratio @xmath126 is about 1/2500 for a field of a tesla .",
    "however , we have not calculated the higher order corrections which while nominally of higher order in @xmath126 might have large or even divergent coefficients . since the vortex vortex interaction depends on quasiparticle - quasihole susceptibility , a change in their spectrum due to the supercurrent ( the volovik effect @xcite ) could have serious consequences . here",
    ", we would like to make two points .",
    "firstly , a calculation by amin , affleck and franz @xcite , using a semiclassical approximation to include the nonlinear effect of the magnetic field _ a la _ volovik , finds that this has little effect on the structural transformations calculated by them .",
    "secondly , _ all _ the recent fully quantum mechanical calculations @xcite of the density of dirac quasiparticle states in a vortex lattice in the london limit find that for bravais lattices , the density of states vanishes linearly with energy as in the absence of a magnetic field ; only the slope changes .",
    "a general argument for this has been presented by vishwanath @xcite .",
    "for these two reasons , we believe that our low density approximation is reliable .    in the london approximation ,",
    "the vortex cores are treated as @xmath92 functions . in reality",
    ", they have a width of order the coherence length .",
    "we believe that the consequences of this approximation , at least for the low field structural transition , are small .",
    "the reason is that the structure sensitive part of the energy arises from the difference in contribution of the smallest reciprocal lattice vectors ( section iii ) . for these , @xmath298 at typical magnetic fields , so that the phenomenological assumption of a gaussian vortex core with width @xmath299 will make a negligible difference to the structure sensitive part .",
    "we have calculated only the ground state energy of the vortex lattice in this paper . at any nonzero temperature , there are obviously entropic contributions which could change the magnetic field at which the structural transition occurs , as a function of temperature . here , we note that since both the structures ( below and above 5 t ) are identical ( triangular ) , and the structure difference sensitive part of the energy is a tiny fraction @xmath300 of the vortex interaction energy , the elastic fluctuations in both structures are expected to be identical to order @xmath301 so that the transition field should not be affected by temperature , so long as the input parameters ( e.g. , @xmath302 ) do not change with @xmath41 .",
    "the same can not be said of the high field @xmath303 triangular to centred square lattice transition , because one has a tight packed structure and the other not .",
    "the expectation is that the former has lesser elastic fluctuations than the latter , so that the transition field boundary should shift to lower values with increasing temperature .",
    "however , this conclusion is tempered by the fact that the london approximation is unreliable at these high fields when vortex cores get close to each other so that our basic result may not be that reliable .",
    "one interesting consequence of the orientational transition at 5 t , which might be measurable , is the change in the very low energy density of quasiparticle states .",
    "at least for a square lattice , vishwanath @xcite has shown that there are quasiparticle states with linear dispersion and that there is a very small gap arising from higher order terms in the quasiparticle velocity .",
    "if this kind of result carries through for a triangular lattice , then it might be an experimental way of observing the transition .",
    "we have calculated here , for the first time , the actual energy of the structure sensitive term ( section iii ) and have found it to be small , of order a few degrees per vortex .",
    "because of this reason , the transition might be difficult to observe , since pinning energies of larger size are generally present @xcite , unless the system is extremely perfect .",
    "we have discussed in detail ( section ii and iii ) the reason why our results differ from those obtained earlier .",
    "basically , it has to do with the anisotropy of the nonlocal current current susceptibility , i.e. the fact that @xmath304 .",
    "the reason for this essentially is that we have an anisotropic superconductor .",
    "the @xmath46 and @xmath47 functions are plotted in fig.[chiab ] .",
    "the question of a non triangular structure of the vortex lattice in cuprates has attracted considerable experimental attention @xcite , especially since it has become established that they are @xmath0 superconductors .",
    "earlier small angle neutron scattering measurements @xcite were on highly twinned 123 crystals , so that the observation of four fold diffraction symmetry does not imply rectanglar /square lattice .",
    "moreover , the positional order is very poor .",
    "a more recent experiment @xcite on untwinned 123 single crystals shows much better translational order ( higher @xmath53 peaks are resolved for the first time ) and a triangular lattice with axes oriented along a , distorted because of @xmath8-@xmath17 asymmetry .",
    "the authors find no structural transitions upto 4 t with field along @xmath2-axis .",
    "they however find a transition from a triangular lattice oriented along @xmath8 to one oriented along the @xmath17 axis at a field of about 3.8 t , oriented at 33@xmath3 to the @xmath2 axis .",
    "this is certainly quite different from the transition to a triangular lattice at 45@xmath3 to @xmath8 axis at 5 t predicted by us . as johnson et al",
    "point out @xcite the observed transition could be due to the presence of chains in 123 , and the novel @xmath305-@xmath2 anisotropy caused by it ( which may have a strong effect on many physical properties ) . in order to seriously explore our conclusions",
    ", one needs to do experiments on cuprates without chains and ideally with tetragonal symmetry , as again mentioned by johnson et al @xcite .    also at condensed matter theory unit ,",
