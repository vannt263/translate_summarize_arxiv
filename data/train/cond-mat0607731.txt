    "the polaron is one of the earliest examples of a topological particle associated with symmetry breaking .",
    "similar examples in the condensed physics are phasons @xcite , solitons @xcite , magnetic polarons @xcite , kosterliz - thouless vortices @xcite , zhang - rice singlets @xcite , and many others .",
    "polaron was initially introduced by landau @xcite as a state of an electron coupled to the classical deformation field , which , by adiabatic self - localization of the electron ( electron self - trapping ) , breaks the original translational symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "the corresponding symmetry restoring goldstone mode ( classical or quantum ) is then the translation of the polaron @xcite .",
    "this description of the ( adiabatic ) polaron , from the broken symmetry side , suggests that the translationally invariant quantum perturbation theory ( tpt ) in terms of the electron - phonon ( e - p ) coupling constant @xmath2 , can not reach such a ( symmetry restored ) state .",
    "indeed , the symmetry breaking ( at @xmath9 ) is , as a rule , associated with the singularity ( quantum critical point , qcp ) in the ground state energy as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "this is usually taken to restrict the use of tpt to the high symmetry ( translationally invariant ) phase on one side of the qcp .",
    "on the other hand , the study of some continuous e - p hamiltonians ( including the 3d frhlich hamiltonian which exhibits a polaron as a classic solution ) , concluded that the corresponding quantum ground state energy is a smooth function of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this shows that , depending on the dimension of the system and the range of the forces , the quantum fluctuations of the deformation field can remove the qcp and replace it by a smooth crossover .",
    "however , this does not guarantee that tpt can hold through such a crossover @xcite , because the absence of a singularity for @xmath2 s , which make the hamiltonian hermitian , can say nothing about the radius of convergence and the behavior of the perturbation series in the complex @xmath2 plane .",
    "the question is not only whether tpt can hold through the symmetry breaking crossover in principle @xcite but also how and for which physical regimes @xcite this can be done in practice .",
    "some elements of the answer to this question are given here .",
    "in the adiabatic limit , which is of the main interest here , the electron is `` self - trapped '' ( adiabatic self - trapping ) , staying always in the same localized state , which moves with the polaron distortion of the lattice . in the continuous approximation ,",
    "the adiabatic polaron is free to move along the lattice .",
    "however , the lattice coarsening introduces the peierls - nabarro ( pn ) or umklapp potential @xcite into the motion of the adiabatic polaron .",
    "if treated classically , even a tiny periodic potential pins the polaron of mass @xmath10 to the lattice .",
    "there are thus two possible , separate , mechanisms which can break the translational symmetry of the lattice on the adiabatic level .",
    "the first is the adiabatic self - trapping of the electron .",
    "the second is the pinning of the adiabatic polaron to the pn potential of the lattice .",
    "however , although there are two symmetry breaking mechanisms , there is only one symmetry to break , namely the translational symmetry of the lattice .",
    "it is therefore important to distinguish between the electron adiabatic self - trapping and the polaron pinning .",
    "as the electron adiabatic self - trapping is prerequisite for the polaron pinning , it is the fundamental mechanism of symmetry breaking . for this reason",
    ", the problem of the applicability of the tpt is focused here on the electron adiabatic self - trapping on the lattice .",
    "in fact , the inter - relation of the electron self - trapping and the polaron pinning can be fully understood in the adiabatic regime . as illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig000 ] , this regime can be reached from the weak and from the strong coupling side . for small @xmath2 ,",
    "the quantum electron - phonon system is described reasonably well by the lowest order perturbation theory in the e - p coupling , which is apparently translationally invariant and nonadiabatic @xcite . for the discrete lattice",
    "the polaron motion is nonadiabatic also for extremely large @xmath2 .",
    "the electron must use phonons nonadiabatically to leave its ( too ) strongly pinned adiabatic phonon correlation cloud in order to gain the delocalization energy .",
    "obviously , this quantum state is also translationally invariant . the adiabatic polaron regime ,",
    "if it exists , is thus separated from the two nonadiabatic , translationally invariant regimes either by a pair of qcp s or by a pair of corresponding crossovers .",
    "which is the case can be found from either ( small or large @xmath2 ) side .",
    "again however , in the case when qcp s are replaced by crossovers , it remains to be proven that tpt can hold through them .    to make the picture complete ,",
    "it should be further realized that on coming from the low @xmath2 side , the qcp or the crossover corresponding to the electron adiabatic self - trapping can , generally speaking , occur either towards the large adiabatic polaron quantum state , when the pn potential although present is negligible , or towards the small adiabatic polaron quantum state , when this potential plays an essential role . in the former case there is an additional crossover , the one from large to the small adiabatic polaron , as indicated by the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig000 ] .",
    "importantly , this behavior can never correspond to the breakdown of the translational symmetry of the lattice ( i.e. , to qcp ) , because , as already mentioned , the latter is consumed by the electron adiabatic self - trapping qcp or by the corresponding crossover .",
    "it appears therefore that the electron adiabatic self - trapping on the lattice provides a critical test for the applicability of tpt . in this context",
    "it is natural to study the low @xmath2 side of the problem , because tpt is the expansion in terms of @xmath2 .",
    "if tpt is able to hold through this crossover or qcp it is likely that it applies , at least in principle , to all values of @xmath2 .",
    "but then , so does also the theory which starts from the broken symmetry side , and it is only a matter of convenience which approach is to be used when .    in the present paper , tpt",
    "is tested on the discrete 1d holstein model .",
    "this model provides a simple example of the general situation described above . for sufficiently fast electrons it exhibits a pair of nonadiabatic / adiabatic crossovers , which replace qcp s @xcite .",
    "the small @xmath2 crossover corresponds to the electron self - trapping in the state of the large adiabatic holstein polaron @xcite . at sufficiently large @xmath2",
    "it is supplemented by the large / small adiabatic polaron crossover in the pn potential , which is thus well separated from the electron self - trapping crossover .",
    "it will be argued here that tpt can reach beyond the low @xmath2 electron self - trapping showing explicitly that this qcp is replaced by the crossover and that the lattice coarsening ( pn , umklapp ) effects are negligible in this case .",
    "finally , some plausible arguments are given which indicate that tpt is valid for all values of @xmath2 , although the full proof of this assertion requires additional considerations .",
    "the holstein hamiltonian on the discrete 1d lattice with @xmath11 sites is given by ( @xmath12 )    @xmath13 \\label{eq001}\\ ] ]    where the fermion and boson operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 on the site @xmath16 are defined in the usual way .",
    "equation ( [ eq001 ] ) is meant to describe @xmath17 electrons subjected to hopping @xmath1 along the chain and to the local interaction @xmath2 with the displacements of the lattice @xmath18 . at @xmath19",
    "the latter behave as harmonic oscillators with frequency @xmath0 and the zero - point displacement @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the ionic mass .",
    "the properties of the holstein hamiltonian for a given @xmath11 and @xmath17 are thus described in the simple @xmath22 parameter space , e.g. in terms of @xmath7 and @xmath23 .",
    "the only adimensional quantity independent of @xmath21 that can be constructed from @xmath7 and @xmath24 is @xmath25 , which has to appear naturally ( instead of @xmath26 ) in the adiabatic regime , of interest here .    the structure of tpt for the hamiltonian ( [ eq001 ] ) and similar models was examined in refs .",
    "the main conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite was that the polaron properties can be conveniently extracted from the correlation functions which form the basis of the diagrammatic version @xcite of tpt .",
    "two types of correlation functions are to be distinguished in this respect , namely those which by construction conserve the number @xmath17 of electrons , and those which do not .",
    "the displacement - displacement correlation function @xmath27 belongs to the first class , and the electron propagator @xmath28 to the second , because it changes @xmath17 by @xmath29 . in the polaron case",
    "@xmath30 is to be taken at @xmath31 and , consistently , @xmath32 at @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 describes the propagation of an electron intermittently added to the system of bosons . actually , on using the lehmann representation of @xmath34 it turned out @xcite that the most important properties of the polaronic correlations can be calculated from the corresponding irreducible electron self - energy @xmath35 alone .",
    "@xmath35 gives the position of the polaron bands , in particular the value of the ground state energy , the effective mass of the polaron , and , in the continuous limit , the polaron width , as will be further discussed below .",
    "the reduction of the problem to the calculation of @xmath35 represents an important simplification , because at @xmath33 all fermionic ( pauli ) correlations are eliminated from the outset .",
    "this contrasts with the calculation @xcite of the ground state energy from its direct diagrammatic expansion at @xmath31 , where the electron exchange effects disappear from the result only after tedious cancellations",
