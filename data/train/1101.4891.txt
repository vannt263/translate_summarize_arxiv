    "when gas collapses to form stars , gravitational energy is transformed to thermal energy and unless this can be dissipated in some fashion , it will eventually halt the collapse .",
    "thermal energy can be dissipated by processes such as atomic fine structure line emission , molecular rotational or vibrational line emission , or the heating of dust grains . in some cases ,",
    "these processes are able to cool the gas significantly during the collapse .",
    "this temperature drop can promote gravitational fragmentation @xcite by diminishing the jeans mass , which means that instead of forming very massive clumps , with fragment masses corresponding to the initial jeans mass in the cloud , it can instead form even more fragments with lower masses .",
    "+ if the gas is cooled only by molecular hydrogen emission , numerical simulations show that the stars should be very massive @xcite .",
    "this happens because the h@xmath2 cooling becomes inefficient for temperatures bellow 200k and densities above @xmath3 . at this temperature and density ,",
    "the mean jeans mass at cloud fragmentation is 1,000 times larger than in present - day molecular clouds , @xmath4 for an atomic gas with temperature @xmath5 and number density @xmath6 .",
    "+ metal line cooling and dust cooling are effective at lower temperatures and larger densities , and so the most widely accepted cause for the transition from pop .",
    "iii to pop .",
    "ii is metal enrichment of the interstellar medium by the previous generations of stars .",
    "this suggests that there might be a critical metallicity z@xmath7 at which the mode of star formation changes .",
    "+ the main coolants that have been studied in the literature are cii and oi fine structure emission @xcite , and dust emission .",
    "c and o are identified as the key species because in the temperature and density conditions that characterise the early phases of pop .",
    "iii star formation , the oi and cii fine - structure lines dominate over all other metal transitions @xcite . by equating the cii or oi fine structure cooling rate to the compressional heating rate due to free - fall collapse , one can define critical abundances @xmath8 = -3.5 $ ] and @xmath9 = -3.0 $ ] = log_{10}(n_{\\rm x}/n_{\\rm y})_{\\star } - log_{10}(n_{\\rm x}/n_{\\rm y})_{\\odot}$ ] , for elements x and y , where @xmath10 denotes the gas in question , and where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mass fractions of the elements x and y. ] for efficient metal line cooling @xcite . however , previous works @xcite show that this metallicity threshold does not represent a critical metallicity : the fact that metal - line cooling has a larger value than the compressional heating does not necessarily lead to fragmentation .",
    "+ dust - cooling models predict a much lower critical metallicity @xmath13 .",
    "the conditions for fragmentation in the low - metallicity dust cooling model are predicted to occur in high density gas , where the distances between the fragments can be very small @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "interactions between fragments will be common , and analytic models of fragmentation are unable to predict the mass distribution of the fragments .",
    "a full 3d treatment , following the fragments , is needed . + initial attempts were made by @xcite and @xcite . however , these treatments used a tabulated equation of state , based on results from previous one - zone chemical models @xcite , to determine the thermal energy .",
    "this approximation assumes that the gas temperature adjusts instantaneously to a new equilibrium temperature whenever the density changes and hence ignores thermal inertia effects .",
    "this may yield too much fragmentation .",
    "+ in this work , we improve upon these previous treatments by solving the full thermal energy equation , and calculating the dust temperature through the energy equilibrium equation . we assume currently that the only significant external heat source is the cmb , and include its effects in the calculation of the dust temperature . +",
    "we model the collapse of a low - metallicity gas cloud using a modified version of the gadget 2 @xcite smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code .",
    "to enable us to continue our simulation beyond the formation of the first very high density protostellar core , we use a sink particle approach @xcite , based on the implementation of . sink particles are created once",

    "particle creation is @xmath15 . at the threshold density ,",
    "the jeans length at the minimum temperature reached by the gas is approximately one au , while at higher densities the gas becomes optically thick and begins to heat up .",
    "further fragmentation on scales smaller than the sink particle scale is therefore unlikely to occur . for further discussion see @xcite .",
    "+ to treat the chemistry and thermal balance of the gas , we use the same approach as in @xcite , with two additions : the inclusion of the effects of dust cooling , as described below , and formation of h2 on the surface of dust grains ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the @xcite chemical network and cooling function were designed for treating primordial gas and do not include the chemistry of metals such as carbon or oxygen , or the effects of cooling from these atoms , or molecules containing them such as co or h@xmath16o .",
    "we justify this approximation by noting that previous studies of very low - metallicity gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) find that gas - phase metals have little influence on the thermal state of the gas .",
    "@xcite showed that h2o and oh are efficient coolants at @xmath17 for their one - zone model . in their hydrodynamical calculations , however , the collapse is faster , and the effect of h2o and oh is not perceptible .",
    "therefore we do not expect oxygen - bearing molecules to have a big effect on the thermal evolution of the gas .",
    "for the metallicities and dust - to - gas ratios considered in this study , the dominant sources of cooling are the standard primordial coolants ( h@xmath16 bound - bound emission and collision - induced emission ) and energy transfer from the gas to the dust .     and @xmath18 times the solar value .",

    "the rate at which energy is transferred from gas to dust is given by @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number density of dust grains , @xmath24 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei , @xmath25 is the mean dust grain cross - section , @xmath26 is the thermal speed of the proton , and @xmath27 is a factor accounting for the ontribution of species other than protons , as well as for charge and accommodation effects .",
    "we assume that @xmath25 is the same as for milky way dust , and that the number density of dust grains is a factor @xmath28 smaller than the milky way value . to compute the rate at which the dust grains radiate away energy",
    ", we use the approximation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the cmb temperature , @xmath31 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the planck and rosseland mean opacities and @xmath34 is the column density of gas measured along a radial ray from the particle to the edge of the cloud . +",
    "as explained by , this expression has the correct behaviour in the optically thin and optically thick limits , and interpolates between these two limits in a smooth fashion . in practice , we approximate further by assuming that the planck and rosseland mean opacities are equaland by using the fact that @xmath35 for a gravitationally collapsing gas , where @xmath36 is the mass density of the gas , and @xmath37 is the jeans length , given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the speed of sound in the gas . by approximating @xmath34 in this fashion",
    ", we avoid the computational difficulties involved with measuring column densities directly in the simulation , while still following the behaviour of the gas reasonably accurately in the optically thick regime . in any case",
    ", most of the interesting behaviour that we find in our simulations occurs while dust cooling remains in the optically thin regime . to compute the temperature of the dust grains , we assume that the dust is in thermal equilibrium , and hence solve the equilibrium equation @xmath40 this equation is transcendental , so we solve it numerically .",
    "we follow the dust opacity model of @xcite , and we calculate the opacity as a function of the dust temperature in the same fashion as in @xcite . to convert from the frequency - dependent opacity given in @xcite to our desired temperature - dependent mean opacity , we assume that for dust with temperature @xmath20 , the dominant contribution to the mean opacity comes from frequencies close to a frequency @xmath41 that is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 . at a reference temperature",

    "so long as @xmath47  k. for grain temperatures larger than 200  k , it is necessary to account for the effects of ice - mantle evaporation , while at much higher grain temperatures , the opacity falls off extremely rapidly due to the melting of the grains .",
    "we account for these effects and so our opacity varies with dust temperature following the relationship @xmath48      .simulation properties . [ cols=\"^,>,>,^,^ \" , ]     we performed three sets of simulations , two at low resolution and one at high resolution .",
    "the details are shown in table  [ tsim ] .",
    "our low resolution simulations were performed to explore the thermal evolution of the gas during the collapse , and had 4 million sph particles which was insufficient to fully resolve fragmentation .",
    "we used these simulations to model the collapse of an initially uniform gas cloud with an initial number density of @xmath49 and an initial temperature of @xmath50 .",
    "we modelled two different metallicities ( 10@xmath51 and 10@xmath52 ) .",
    "the initial cloud mass was @xmath53 , and the mass resolution was @xmath54 . in one set of low - resolution simulations",
    "the gas was initially at rest , while in the other , we included small amounts of turbulent and rotational energy , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the gravitational potential energy , @xmath58 is the turbulent kinetic energy and @xmath59 is the rotational energy . for our high resolution simulations , which were designed to investigate whether the gas would fragment , we employed 40 million sph particles .",
    "we adopted initial conditions similar to those in the low - resolution run with turbulence and rotation .",
    "again , we simulated two metallicities , 10@xmath51 and 10@xmath52 .",
    "the mass resolution ( taken to be 100 times the sph particle mass ) was @xmath60 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in figure  [ nt ] , we compare the evolution of the dust and gas temperatures in the low - resolution simulations .",
    "the dust temperature , shown in the lower part of the panels , varies from the cmb temperature in the low density region to the gas temperature at much higher densities . at densities higher than @xmath61@xmath62 ,",
    "dust cooling starts to be effective and begins to cool the gas .",
    "the gas temperature decreases to roughly 600  k in the @xmath63 simulations , and 300  k in the z @xmath64 case .",
    "this temperature decrease significantly increases the number of jeans masses present in the collapsing region , making the gas unstable to fragmentation .",
    "the dust and the gas temperatures couple for densities higher then @xmath65 , when the compressional heating starts to dominate again over the dust cooling .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the gas is close to adiabatic .",
    "if we compare the results of the runs with and without rotation and turbulence , then the most obvious difference is the much greater scatter in the @xmath66 diagram in the former case .",
    "variations in the infall velocity lead to different fluid elements undergoing different amounts of compressional heating .",
    "the overall effect is to reduce both the infall velocity and the average compressional heating rate .",
    "this allows dust cooling to dominate at a density that is up to five times smaller than in the case without rotation or turbulence .",
    "the gas also reaches a lower temperature , cooling down to @xmath67 200k ( instead of 300k ) for the z @xmath64 case , and to @xmath67 400k ( instead of 600k ) for the z @xmath68 case .",
    "this behavior shows that it is essential to use 3d simulations to follow the evolution of the collapsing gas .",
    "a similar effect can be seen in @xcite .",
    "we follow the thermodynamical evolution of the gas up to very high densities of order @xmath69 , where the jeans mass is @xmath70 , and so we need a high resolution simulation to study the fragmentation behaviour .",
    "the transport of angular momentum to smaller scales during the collapse leads to the formation of a dense disk - like structure , supported by rotation which then fragments into several objects .",
    "figure  [ nall ] shows the density structure in the gas immediately before the formation of the first protostar .",
    "the top - left panel shows a density slice on a scale comparable to the size of the initial gas distribution .",
    "the structure is very filamentary and there are two main overdense clumps in the center .",
    "if we zoom in on one of the clumps , we see that its internal structure is also filamentary .",
    "we can follow the collapse down to scales of the order of an au , but at this point we reach the limit of our computational approach : as the gas collapses further , the courant timestep becomes very small , making it difficult to follow the further evolution of the cloud . in order to avoid this difficulty , we replace very dense , gravitationally bound , and collapsing regions by sink particles .",
    "once the conditions for sink particle creation are met , they start to form in the highest density regions ( figure [ clumpall ] ) . due to interactions with other sink particles that result in an increase in velocity , some sink particles can be ejected from the high - density region , but most of the particles still remain within the dense gas . within 137 years of the formation of the first sink particle ,",
    "45 sink particles have formed . at this time",
    ", approximately @xmath71 of gas has been accreted by the sink particles .",
    "the box is 100au x 100au and the time is measured from the formation of the first sink particle.[clumpall],scaledwidth=50.0% ]      figure [ sinkmf ] shows the mass distribution of sink particles when we stop the calculation .",
    "we typically find masses below @xmath72 , with somewhat smaller values in the @xmath73 case compared to the @xmath74 case .",
    "both histograms have the lowest sink particle mass well above the resolution limit of @xmath75 .",
    "note that in both cases , we are still looking at the very early stages of star cluster evolution . as a consequence ,",
    "the sink particle masses in figure [ sinkmf ] are not the same as the final protostellar masses  there are many mechanisms that will affect the mass function , such as continuing accretion , mergers between the newly formed protostars , feedback from winds , jets and luminosity accretion , etc .",
    "nevertheless , we can speculate that the typical stellar mass is similar to what is observed for pop ii stars in the milky way .",
    "this suggests that the transition from high - mass primordial stars to population ii stars with mass function similar to that at the present day occurs early in the metal evolution history of the universe , at metallicities @xmath76 .",
    "the number of protostars formed by the end of the simulation , for both @xmath77 ( 45 ) and @xmath78 ( 19 ) cases , is much larger than the initial number of jeans masses ( 3 ) in the cloud .",

    "in this paper we have addressed the question of whether dust cooling can lead to the fragmentation of low - metallicity star - forming clouds . for this purpose we performed numerical simulations to follow the thermodynamical and chemical evolution of collapsing clouds .",
    "the chemical model included a primordial chemical network together with a description of dust evolution , where the dust temperature was calculated by solving self - consistently the thermal energy equilibrium equation .",

    "an increase in metallicity implies a higher dust - to - gas ratio , and consequently stronger cooling by dust .",
