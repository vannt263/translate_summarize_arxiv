    "we study the process @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is a vector meson : @xmath9 @xmath6 , @xmath8 , @xmath5 , @xmath4 or @xmath7 ) in the perturbative regge limit , @xmath10 .",
    "the largeness of @xmath11 allows the application of the solutions of the non - forward bfkl equation .",
    "we apply the analytic solutions to the cross - section arrived at in @xcite in the case of a delta - function distribution for the meson wavefunction .",
    "specifically we apply this solution to the case of a real photon which has been measured at hera @xcite .",
    "the cross - section for the helicity - flip process @xmath12 vanishes for a delta - function wavefunction and throughout this paper the cross - sections pertain to the process @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 and @xmath15 correspond to longitudinal and transverse polarization respectively ) .",
    "this approximation is justifiable since the measured rate for longitudinal mesons is indeed small @xcite .",
    "we make predictions and compare to experiment for the mesons for which data are available , the heavy @xmath4 and the light @xmath6 and @xmath5 ( for which we might expect the delta - function to be a poor approximation ) .",
    "we show that the data for all the mesons can be well described by the bfkl approach .",
    "we then demonstrate that the two - gluon exchange model is incapable of adequately describing the data .",
    "finally we make predictions for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the high momentum exchange allows us to factorize the cross - section into the usual product of the parton distribution functions and the parton level cross - section :    @xmath16\\biggr ) \\frac{d\\sigma ( \\gamma q\\rightarrow vq)}{dt}+g(x , t)\\frac{d\\sigma ( \\gamma g\\rightarrow vg)}{dt},\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the gluon and quark parton distribution functions respectively and we sum over flavour , @xmath19 . for a large separation in rapidity between the parton and the vector meson we may write ,    @xmath20\\biggr ) \\frac{d\\sigma ( \\gamma q\\rightarrow vq)}{dt},\\ ] ]    where we define the parton level amplitude by    @xmath21",
    "where @xmath22 is the centre - of - mass energy squared of the photon - proton system and @xmath23 is that of the photon - parton system .",
    "we consider two types of colour singlet exchange : two - gluon and bfkl .",
    "the two - gluon amplitude can be expressed to leading order in @xmath24 in the impact factor representation :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the impact factors associated with the couplings of the two gluons to the external particles .",
    "vectors with the subscript @xmath28 are two dimensional transverse momenta and @xmath29 . with the above definitions the impact factor for @xmath30",
    "is given by    @xmath31    the @xmath32 impact factor , assuming a delta - function form for the meson wavefunction , is    @xmath33    where ,    @xmath34    @xmath35 is the mass of the vector meson and @xmath36 is the electronic decay width of the meson . using these impact factors",
    "we obtain the two - gluon amplitude as a function of one dimensionless parameter , @xmath37 :    @xmath38    which has the mathematical property @xmath39 as @xmath40 .    the bfkl amplitude , in the leading logarithm approximation ( lla ) ,",
    "is given by @xcite ,    @xmath41    where    @xmath42    and @xmath43 in lla , @xmath44 is arbitrary ( it need only be small compared to @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 is a constant .",
    "the impact factors are used , in conjunction with the prescription of @xcite , to give    @xmath47e^{ik_{\\perp } \\cdot \\rho _ { 1}+i(q_{\\perp } -k_{\\perp } ) \\cdot \\rho _ { 2}},\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the case of coupling to a colourless state only the first term in the square bracket survives since @xmath48 in this case . after some work",

    "using the full numerical calculation for the amplitude we convoluted the partonic cross - section for the mesons with the parton density functions of the proton , integrating over @xmath50 in the region @xmath51 ( for which the zeus data are quoted ) .",
    "we obtained fits to the zeus data in terms of three free parameters @xcite .",
    "one parameter is @xmath46 and the others appear in the denominator of the logarithm defining the energy variable @xmath52 , i.e. we take @xmath53 .",
    "initially we tried the simple prescription of @xcite where @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath4 has been fitted with @xmath55 for this parameterization previously @xcite @xcite . ] and as expected this gave a @xmath56 , however these parameters gave very poor fits to the @xmath6 and @xmath5 . when we varied all three parameters independently we found that optimum fits took small values of @xmath57 and in fact we were able to put this parameter to zero .",
    "[ contours ] shows contours of constant @xmath58 .",
    "the contours continue beyond the region @xmath59 without closing . further imposing the requirement that @xmath60 as a sensible criterion for the dominance of leading logs , a simultaneous fit for the three mesons rules out the region of @xmath61 in fig .",
    "[ contours ] .",
    "in addition , sub - asymptotic leading log contributions become increasingly important as we increase the strong coupling to @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "[ contours ] suggests that we can get acceptable fits for @xmath63 ; while this is true we are then forced to accept unnaturally small values of @xmath64 .",
    "we note that this range of @xmath65 is consistent with the value extracted from the tevatron `` gaps between jets '' data @xcite .",
    "it should be observed that the acceptable fits lie in a narrow valley in parameter space .",
    "it turns out that the relation ,    @xmath66    with @xmath67 gives a good approximation of the flow of @xmath68 with @xmath64 for a constant @xmath58 .",
    "the width of the @xmath69dof@xmath70 valley corresonds to a band @xmath71 , with the minimum at approximately @xmath72 .",
    "perhaps the most natural fit is ( @xmath68 , @xmath64 , @xmath73 ) = ( 0.2 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) . the bfkl differential cross - section predictions for the three mesons are shown in fig .",
    "[ diffcross ] , along with the zeus data @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that the largeness of @xmath11 does allow a perturbative calculation to be performed however it is reasonable to ask whether it is necessary to invoke the full machinery of bfkl .",
    "hence we also show the two - gluon exchange fits in fig .",
    "[ diffcross ] .",
    "the two - gluon calculation only has one free parameter , @xmath46 , and the differential cross - section has a fourth order power dependence on it .",
    "it is apparent that this approximation provides a very poor description of the light mesons , for which @xmath74 over much of the range of data .",
    "note that the model starts to give the correct qualitative behaviour away from @xmath75 .",
    "note in particular that @xmath46 has been fitted for each meson separately and also the unnatural trend that @xmath46 falls as @xmath35 falls , which means that running the coupling only makes the situation worse .",
    "the @xmath76 differential cross - section , to which we would expect our calculation to be most applicable can be fitted by the two - gluon exchange amplitude in the zeus @xmath77-range . for a plausible strong coupling @xmath78",
    "we obtain @xmath79dof@xmath80 . it should be noted however that the two - gluon curve is already starting its dip towards zero at @xmath81 , by the end of the zeus @xmath77 range .",
    "h1 data for this process reaching out to much higher",
    "@xmath82 should make it clear whether or not two - gluon exchange is sufficient to describe the @xmath76 .",
    "[ prediction ] shows our predictions for the @xmath83 and @xmath84 mesons .",
    "the bounds come from the uncertainty in the normalization of the lo bfkl solution , specifically from varying @xmath68 while keeping @xmath85 and @xmath69dof@xmath86 .",
    "the major part of the uncertainty is in normalisation ; the shape being rather well predicted",
    ". the bounds for the @xmath8 are clearly much narrower than for the @xmath7 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath87 which means that @xmath88 .",
    "this scaling relationship between the @xmath6 and @xmath8 is a model independent feature and also true of the two - gluon model .",
    "it should be noted that as we approach the lower bound for the @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ prediction ] ( a ) , we are extending the model beyond the leading log region ( due to largeness of @xmath89 ) , so this bound must be viewed with some caution .",
    "if subsequent measurements yield data lying outside these bounds it would indicate either a failure of the lla bfkl formalism , or a need to refine our treatment of the meson wavefunction .",
    "if other light vector mesons , such as the @xmath8 , subsequently confirm our predictions it would suggest that in some instances even mesons made of light quarks can act as if they consist of two constituent quarks which share the meson s energy and momentum .    for all of the measured mesons , the experimental errors are about 10 - 20% of the absolute value of the differential cross - section . that we can fit the data suggests that genuine higher order corrections and the corrections due to the meson wavefunction may contribute no more than 10 - 20% .",
    "in @xcite a lla bfkl calculation incorporating a more sophisticated meson wavefunction than that used here is performed .",
    "it was concluded in @xcite that this light meson calculation is incompatible with the available data .",
    "however , the author of @xcite interprets the masses appearing in ( [ con ] ) as current masses ( as ought to be appropriate for a truly perturbative calculation ) which justifies the neglect of the quark mass for light mesons , rendering @xmath90 the only relevant scale . by interpreting the quark mass as a constituent mass , and assuming that the quark and anti - quark share the meson momentum , we have demonstrated that the data can be understood provided the constituent mass is taken to be the scale in @xmath44 .",
    "another point of deviation is in the treatment of the strong coupling @xmath46 . in @xcite",
    "the coupling is a running coupling whilst we have considered a fixed coupling . the problem with running the coupling it is that we do not really know how it runs .",
    "of course a complete description should incorporate a running coupling , but the work of @xcite might be a hint that a fixed coupling may be appropriate for the bfkl exchange .",
    "the work of @xcite has been developed in @xcite where it is proposed that a large contribution arising from @xmath91 fluctuations in a chiral - odd spin configuration should play an important role in the region of the data .",
    "it remains to be seen if the simple model presented here can be justified within this approach .",
    "our results suggest that the two - gluon model is inadequate at least for the light mesons .",
    "the model predicts a dip at @xmath75 which is not present in the data and this is the biggest obstacle to getting a decent fit .",
    "corrections to the two - gluon approximation do fill in the dip ( see @xcite for more details on how this occurs ) and further study is called for to establish whether a more sophisticated two - gluon or finite order ( in @xmath68 ) calculation might work .    the model explored here has experimental tests to face in the future . if data confirm our predictions for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 it will be impressive .",
    "data on the process @xmath92 , for which theoretical calculations have already been performed @xcite , should be obtained in the forseeable future .",
    "this process along with the ones considered here will continue to provide an important test of the validity of bfkl dynamics .",
    "we thank the zeus collaboration for providing the data used in this paper and in particular we also thank james crittenden , brian foster , katarzyna klimek , yuji yamazaki and giuseppe iacobucci for their help and advice .",
