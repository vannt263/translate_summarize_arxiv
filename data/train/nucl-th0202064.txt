    "with the knowledge of solving precisely few - nucleon equations , the availability of high precision nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potentials and the insight into the electromagnetic nucleonic current operator it is seducing to ask very detailed questions about spin dependent momentum distributions inside light nuclei and the way to access them through electron scattering taking final state interactions fully into account .",
    "momentum distributions of polarized @xmath4 clusters in spin orientated @xmath3he have been studied before , see for instance @xcite .",
    "we address here the question whether these distributions are accessible through the @xmath5 or @xmath6 processes .",
    "optimal kinematical conditions are that the polarisations of @xmath3he and of the knocked out proton ( deuteron ) and the momenta of the final proton and deuteron are collinear to the photon momentum . as we will show the longitudinal and transverse response functions will lead , up to known factors , directly to the searched for spin dependent momentum distribution of the @xmath7 clusters in @xmath3he .",
    "one can also define a proper asymmetry , which carries corresponding information .",
    "of course this can only be true in plane wave impulse approximation and for the absorption of the photon on a single nucleon . rescattering effects in the final state as well as",
    "meson exchange currents will disturb the outcome .",
    "the strength of that disturbance again will depend on the photon momentum q with the hope that it decreases with increasing q.    we formulate the electromagnetic process in sec .",
    "ii and also display there the searched for @xmath8 cluster momentum distributions of @xmath3he .",
    "iii shows our results for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 processes based on the av18 nn potential  @xcite and precise solutions of the corresponding faddeev equations .",
    "since our predictions depend on the full dynamics in a highly nontrivial manner , a future experimental verification will be an important test for the understanding of few - nucleon dynamics .",
    "we end with a brief summary in sec .  iv .",
    "the spin dependent momentum distribution of proton - deuteron clusters inside the @xmath3he nucleus is defined as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the proton momentum ( the deuteron momentum is @xmath11 ) ; @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are spin magnetic quantum numbers for the proton , deuteron and the considered nucleus , respectively .",
    "we introduce our standard basis in momentum space  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are magnitudes of jacobi momenta and the set of discrete quantum numbers @xmath18 comprises angular momenta , spins and isospins for a three - nucleon ( 3n ) system .",
    "then @xmath19 can be evaluated as    @xmath20    in eq .",
    "( 3 ) @xmath21 are the partial wave projected wave function components of @xmath3he in momentum space and @xmath22 are the s- and d - wave components of the deuteron .",
    "further we rewrite @xmath19 as @xmath23 and define an auxiliary quantity @xmath24 as    @xmath25    note that the set @xmath26 contributes only for the deuteron quantum numbers @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "further @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "it is clear that using this quantity @xmath34 the spin dependent momentum distribution @xmath35 can be constructed for any combination of magnetic quantum numbers and direction @xmath36 .    in this paper",
    "all our calculations are based on the nn force av18  @xcite .",
    "we display @xmath34 in fig .  1 .",
    "note that @xmath37 is the relative orbital angular momentum of the proton with respect to the deuteron inside @xmath3he . as we see from fig .  1 , the @xmath38-wave ( @xmath37 = 0 ) dominates the momentum distribution @xmath39 for the small relative momenta and has a node around @xmath40 = 400 mev / c . near that value and above the @xmath38- and @xmath41-wave contributions are comparable .    in fig .  2 we show the quantities @xmath19 for @xmath42 pointing in the direction of the spin quantisation axis and the @xmath3he nucleus polarised with @xmath43 .",
    "the polarisations of the proton and deuteron are chosen as @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "we see an interesting shift in the minima from @xmath40= 300 to 500 mev / c , if the polarisation of the proton ( deuteron ) switches from a parallel ( perpendicular ) to an antiparallel ( parallel ) orientation in relation to the spin direction of @xmath3he .",
    "this strong spin dependence leads to a pronounced spin asymmetry defined as    @xmath46    and shown in fig .",
    "next we ask the question , how this quantity can be accessed experimentally .",
    "the cross section for the process @xmath47 has the form  @xcite    @xmath48    where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are analytically given kinematical factors , and @xmath52 is the helicity of the incoming electron .",
    "the response functions @xmath53 , which contain the whole dynamical information , are constructed from the current matrix elements taken between the initial bound state @xmath54 and the final scattering state @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "they are given as    @xmath56    @xmath57    @xmath58    @xmath59    @xmath60    @xmath61    note that @xmath62 and @xmath63 contribute only in the case when the initial electron is polarized .",
    "this is our standard notation @xmath64 of the nuclear matrix element , where the indices @xmath65 and @xmath66 stand for the zeroth component and the transverse spherical components of the current .",
    "the general 3n current operator contains the single nucleon contributions as well as two- and three - nucleon exchange terms    @xmath67    in the nonrelativistic limit , which we use , the three contributing pieces of the single nucleon current operator ( the charge density , the convection and the spin current ) can be written in the 3n momentum space as    @xmath68    @xmath69    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the nucleon mass and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are sums of isospin projection operators for the neutron and proton joined by the electric ( @xmath74 ) and magnetic ( @xmath75 ) nucleon form factors , respectively ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we assumed that @xmath76 .",
    "let us now decompose the scattering state @xmath55 in the following way    @xmath77    the first term is just a product of the deuteron wave function @xmath78 and a relative momentum eigenstate of the spectator nucleon @xmath79 .",
    "the other term accounts for the proper antisymmetrization of the final state and all rescattering contributions .",
    "if the many - nucleon contributions to the 3n current ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 can be neglected ( pwia assumption ) , then the current matrix elements take the following form    @xmath83    @xmath84    @xmath85    in the laboratory frame @xmath86 and by definition of the jacobi momentum @xmath87 , thus @xmath88 . the second argument of the @xmath3he wave function component",
    "is therefore just the deuteron lab momentum . for the parallel kinematics ( @xmath89 ) the matrix element @xmath90 is zero .    in this particular situation , and for the initial target spin parallel to @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) only few combinations of the magnetic quantum numbers contribute to the nuclear matrix elements @xmath93 and @xmath94 . because of the choice of the parallel kinematics and the property of the spherical harmonics these are @xmath95 and @xmath96 in @xmath93 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 in @xmath99 and @xmath100 in @xmath101 .",
    "furthermore , if we compare the expressions given in eqs .",
    "( 14 ) and ( 16 ) to the one in eq .",
    "( 3 ) we find that the searched for spin dependent momentum distributions @xmath39 of @xmath3he are connected to @xmath102 by @xmath103 and by @xmath104 in the case of parallel kinematics @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath63 vanish .",
    "this follows from the fact that the conditions on the magnetic quantum numbers , @xmath14 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 , given in products of @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 can not be simultaneously fulfilled . for an experiment with unpolarized electrons , the cross section ( 7 )",
    "contains then only the longitudinal ( @xmath110 ) and transverse ( @xmath111 ) response functions : @xmath112 thus the standard `` l - t '' separation is required in order to access individually @xmath110 and @xmath111 .    another possibility is offered by an experiment with a polarized electron beam . in this case",
    "no further separation of response functions is required , since    @xmath113    therefore under these extreme simplifying assumptions the response functions @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath62 carry directly the searched for information . note that in case of @xmath111 ( @xmath62 ) only one of the two parts gives a nonzero contribution .",
    "the full dynamics adds antisymmetrization in the final state .",
    "( note our single nucleon current operator as given in eqs .",
    "( 10)-(12 ) acts only on one particle .",
    "antisymmetrization in the final state is equivalent to the action of the current on all three particles ) .",
    "then of course rescattering to all orders in the nn @xmath114-operator has to be included . on top one",
    "should add at least two - body currents .",
    "we have described how to do that before at several places  @xcite .",
    "here we only remark that we employ standard @xmath115- and @xmath51-like exchange currents related to the nn force av18 , which we use throughout the paper , and that adequate faddeev equations for @xmath3he and for the treatment of fsi have been solved precisely .",
    "since we work strictly nonrelativistically we want to keep the 3n c.m .",
    "energy , @xmath116 , below the pion threshold .",
    "but in that regime we would like to study many kinematical configurations and also include higher three - momenta @xmath117 of the photon .",
    "we display in table  i the kinematical conditions , for which our studies have been carried through .",
    "in parallel kinematics one can distinguish three cases for the momentum orientations of the final proton and deuteron , which we denote by @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , and which are depicted in fig .",
    "thus for @xmath119 the final momenta of proton and deuteron are parallel to @xmath121 , whereas in @xmath118 and @xmath120 only one of them lies in the direction of @xmath121 , the other is opposite .",
    "table  i shows for an ( arbitrarily selected ) initial electron energy of 1.2 gev various relevant variables : the electron scattering angle , the proton and deuteron momenta @xmath122 and @xmath123 , the photon energy @xmath124 , the three momentum of the photon @xmath117 and finally the 3n c.m .",
    "energy @xmath116 .",
    "the additional label distinguishes the three cases @xmath118 to @xmath120 .",
    "we see that for each fixed @xmath123 value we cover a certain range of @xmath117-values .",
    "the three @xmath118 configurations with @xmath125 140 mev are above the pion threshold and have to be taken with caution .",
    "we evaluated all the cases of table  i but do not show all in case the results are similar .",
    "5 displays @xmath126 for @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , @xmath130 against the available @xmath117-values according to table  i. according to eqs .",
    "( 17 ) and  ( 18 ) in pwia @xmath126 is just the searched for @xmath39 and thus trivially independent of @xmath117 .",
    "symmetrising the final state but still neglecting rescattering is called pwias , while predictions including additionally fsi are denoted by full .",
    "we see a change of patterns in going from @xmath123= 100 to 200 and from 400 to 500 mev / c .",
    "as seen from table  i this is related to the different motions of the final proton and deuteron , in other words one switches from the configuration @xmath118 to @xmath119 and then to @xmath120 .",
    "symmetrisation ( pwias ) has little effect at @xmath123= 10 ( not shown ) and 100 mev / c but has a big one for the smaller @xmath117 values in case of @xmath123= 200400 mev / c and for all @xmath117-values in case of @xmath123= 500600 mev / c .",
    "rescattering plays mostly a strong role . in case of @xmath118 ( @xmath123= 10 and 100 mev / c ) its effects are relatively small and diminish nicely with increasing q. in case of @xmath119 ( @xmath123= 200400 mev / c ) its role is dramatic for @xmath123= 300 and 400 mev / c , which has to be expected since the proton and the deuteron travel together with a low relative energy @xmath116 . in case of @xmath120",
    "the two particles travel again opposite to each other as for @xmath118 and @xmath116 decreases with increasing @xmath117 . in this case",
    "the by far dominant contribution to the very strong deviation from pwia comes from antisymmetrization in the final state and fsi leads to a relatively mild modification in case of @xmath128 but a significantly larger one for @xmath131 .",
    "thus we see quite different outcomes depending on the cases and these theoretical predictions would be very interesting to be compared to data .    in case of @xmath111 and",
    "@xmath62 the spin operator appears in the current and moreover one can see the effects of the @xmath115- and @xmath51-like mec s .",
    "nevertheless the situation for @xmath132 shown in fig .",
    "6 is roughly spoken similar to the one for @xmath126 .",
    "( we regard only @xmath111 but of course @xmath62 carries the same information . ) additionally one observes the effects of mec s , which are pronounced for @xmath123= 300 and 400 mev / c .    in view of all",
    "that , can we identify kinematic regions to pin down the searched for momentum distributions using @xmath110 or @xmath111 ?",
    "we choose the cases of the closest approach of pwia and full calculations ( with mec s in case of @xmath111 ) for the different @xmath123 values .",
    "they are displayed in figs .",
    "7 and  8 together with the spin dependent momentum distributions @xmath133 from fig .  2 . in case of @xmath134",
    "the values of closest approach extracted from @xmath110 and @xmath111 differ for the larger @xmath40 values , where they also do not reach @xmath39 . only to the left of the zero of @xmath39 they agree with each other and with @xmath39 . for @xmath135",
    "the predictions for @xmath110 and @xmath111 agree with each other but do not show the strong dip of @xmath39 . for the smaller @xmath40-values they agree with @xmath39 . as a consequence of these results",
    "the asymmetry @xmath136 formed out of those values of closest approach can not follow the asymmetry formed out of the @xmath39 s .",
    "only the values extracted for @xmath110 show a mild similarity with the searched for @xmath136 , as shown in fig .",
    "based on the nn force av18 and consistent @xmath115- and @xmath51-like exchange currents we investigated within the faddeev framework the process @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) .",
    "the aim was to have access to the spin - dependent momentum distribution of polarized @xmath7 clusters in polarized @xmath3he . that distribution would provide interesting insight into the @xmath3he wave function .",
    "we restricted ourselves to a nonrelativistic regime , where the 3n c.m .",
    "energy of the final state should stay below the pion threshold . in that kinematical regime we explored the longitudinal and transverse response functions @xmath110 and @xmath111 , as well as @xmath62 , as a function of the final deuteron and the allowed photon momenta .",
    "all the spins and momenta are chosen parallel or antiparallel to the photon momentum .",
    "while in pwia @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( @xmath62 ) up to known factors yield directly the searched for spin - dependent momentum distribution , fsi and mec s preclude in most cases the direct access to that distribution .",
    "the response functions @xmath110 and @xmath111 multiplied by appropriate factors have been mapped out in a wide kinematical range and this theoretical outcome should be checked experimentally .",
    "it presents the present day state - of - the - art insight into the dominant photon absorption process and the few - nucleon dynamics .",
    "it is only at small deuteron momenta @xmath137 that the searched for momentum distribution can be accessed within the constrained kinematics we have chosen .",
    "right now we have no reliable estimate for the amount of relativistic corrections nor insight into the stability of our results under exchange of nuclear forces and consistent mec s .",
