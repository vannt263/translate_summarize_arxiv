    "-5 mm    in 1781 , g.monge raised in @xcite the problem of transporting a given distribution of matter ( a pile of sand for instance ) into another ( an excavation for instance ) in such a way that the work done is minimal . denoting by @xmath2 the borel functions describing the initial and final distribution of matter , there is obviously a compatibility condition , that the total mass is the same : @xmath3 assuming with no loss of generality that the total mass is @xmath4 , we say that a borel map @xmath5 is a _ transport _ if a local version of the balance of mass condition holds , namely @xmath6 then , the monge problem consists in minimizing the work of transportation in the class of transports , i.e. @xmath7    the monge transport problem can be easily generalized in many directions , and all these generalizations have proved to be quite useful :    @xmath8 general measurable spaces @xmath9 , @xmath10 , with measurable maps @xmath11 ;    @xmath8 general probability measures @xmath12 in @xmath9 and @xmath13 in @xmath10 .",
    "in this case the local balance of mass condition ( [ balance1 ] ) reads as follows : @xmath14 this means that the push - forward operator @xmath15 induced by @xmath16 , mapping probability measures in @xmath9 into probability measures in @xmath10 , maps @xmath12 into @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath8 general cost functions : a measurable map @xmath17 $ ] . in this case",
    "the cost to be minimized is @xmath18    even in euclidean spaces , the problem of existence of optimal transport maps is far from being trivial , mainly due to the non - linearity with respect to @xmath16 of the condition @xmath19 .",
    "in particular the class of transports is not closed with respect to any reasonable weak topology .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to build examples where the monge problem is ill - posed simply because there is no transport map : this happens for instance when @xmath12 is a dirac mass and @xmath13 is not a dirac mass .    in order to overcome these difficulties , in 1942 l.v.kantorovich proposed in @xcite a notion of weak solution of the transport problem .",
    "he suggested to look for _ plans _ instead of transports , i.e. probability measures @xmath20 in @xmath21 whose marginals are @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "formally this means that @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the canonical projections . denoting by @xmath26 the class of plans , he wrote the following minimization problem @xmath27 notice that @xmath26 is not empty , as the product @xmath28 has @xmath12 and @xmath13 as marginals .",
    "due to the convexity of the new constraint @xmath29 it turns out that weak topologies can be effectively used to provide existence of solutions to ( [ kant ] ) : this happens for instance whenever @xmath9 and @xmath10 are polish spaces and @xmath1 is lower semicontinuous ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "notice also that , by convexity of the energy , the infimum is attained on a _ extremal _ element of @xmath26 .",
    "the connection between the kantorovich formulation of the transport problem and monge s original one can be seen noticing that any transport map @xmath16 induces a planning @xmath20 , defined by @xmath30 .",
    "this planning is concentrated on the graph of @xmath16 in @xmath21 and it is easy to show that the converse holds , i.e. whenever @xmath20 is concentrated on a graph , then @xmath20 is induced by a transport map .",
    "since any transport induces a planning with the same cost , it turns out that @xmath31 moreover , by approximating any plan by plans induced by transports , it can be shown that equality holds under fairly general assumptions ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we can really consider the kantorovich formulation of the transport problem as a weak formulation of the original problem .",
    "if all extremal points of @xmath26 were induced by transports one would get existence of transport maps directly from the kantorovich formulation .",
    "it is not difficult to show that plannings @xmath20 induced by transports are extremal in @xmath26 .",
    "the converse holds in some very particular cases , but unfortunately it is not true in general .",
    "it turns out that the existence of optimal transport maps depends not only on the geometry of @xmath26 , but also ( in a quite sensible way ) on the choice of the cost function @xmath1 .",
    "-5 mm    in this section we focus on the problem of the existence of optimal transport maps in the sense of monge . before discussing in detail in the next sections the two model cases in which the cost function is the square of a distance or a distance ( we refer to @xcite for the case of _ concave _ functions of the distance , not discussed here ) , it is better to give an informal description of the tools by now available for proving the existence of optimal transport maps .",
    "* strategy a * ( dual formulation ) .",
    "this strategy is based on the duality formula @xmath32 where the supremum runs among all pairs @xmath33 such that @xmath34 .",
    "the duality approach to the ( mk ) problem was developed by kantorovich , and then extended to more general cost functions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the transport map is obtained from an optimal pair @xmath35 in the dual formulation by making a first variation .",
    "this strategy for proving the existence of an optimal transport map goes back to the papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "* strategy b * ( cyclical monotonicity ) . in some situations",
    "the necessary ( and sufficient ) minimality conditions for the primal problem , based upon the so - called @xmath1-cyclical monotonicity ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) yield that _ any _ optimal kantorovich solution @xmath20 is concentrated on a graph @xmath0 ( i.e. for @xmath12-a.e .",
    "@xmath36 there exists a _ unique _",
    "@xmath37 such that @xmath38 ) and therefore is induced by a transport @xmath16 .",
    "+ this happens for instance when @xmath39 , with @xmath40 _ strictly _ convex in @xmath41 .",
    "this approach is pursued in the papers @xcite , @xcite .    * strategy c * ( singular perturbation with strictly convex costs ) .",
    "one can try to get an optimal transport map by making the cost strictly convex through a perturbation and then passing to the limit ( see @xcite and theorem  [ tcaff ] , theorem  [ tcaff1 ] below ) .",
    "the main difficulty is to show ( strong ) convergence at the level of the transport maps and not only at the level of transport plans .",
    "* strategy d * ( reduction to a lower dimensional problem ) .",
    "this strategy has been initiated by v.n.sudakov in @xcite .",
    "it consists in writing ( typically through a disintegration ) @xmath12 and @xmath13 as the superposition of measures concentrated on lower dimensional sets and in solving the lower dimensional transport problems , trying in the end to `` glue '' all the partial transport maps into a single transport map .",
    "this strategy is discussed in detail in @xcite and used , together with a `` variational '' decomposition , in @xcite .",
    "the simplest case is when the lower dimensional problems are @xmath4-dimensional , since the solution of the @xmath4-dimensional transport problem is simply given by an increasing rearrangement , at least for convex functions of the distance ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "strategies a and b are basically equivalent and yield existence and uniqueness at the same time : the first one could be preferable for someone , as a very small measure - theoretic apparatus is involved . on the other hand , it strongly depends on the existence of maximizing pairs in the dual formulation , and this existence issue can be more subtle than the existence issue for the primal problem ( see @xcite and the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason it seems that the second strategy can work for more general classes of cost functions .",
    "strategies c and d have been devised to deal with situations where the cost function is convex but not strictly convex . also these two strategies are closely related , as the strictly convex perturbation often leads to an effective dimension reduction of the problem ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "-5 mm    in this section we consider the case when @xmath43 and the cost function @xmath1 is proportional to the square of a distance @xmath44 . for convenience",
    "we normalize @xmath1 so that @xmath45 .",
    "the first result in the euclidean space @xmath41 has been discovered independently by many authors y.brenier @xcite , @xcite , s.t.rachev and l.r.schendorf @xcite , @xcite , and c.smith and m.knott @xcite .",
    "[ tbrenier ] assume that @xmath12 is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath46 and that @xmath12 and @xmath13 have finite second order moments .",
    "then there exists a unique optimal transport map @xmath16 .",
    "moreover @xmath16 is the gradient of a convex function .    in this case",
    "the proof comes from the fact that both strategies a and b yield that the displacement @xmath47 is the gradient of a @xmath1-concave function , i.e. a function representable as @xmath48 for a suitable non - empty set @xmath49 .",
    "the concept of @xmath1-concavity @xcite has been extensively used to develop a very general duality theory for the ( mk ) problem , based on ( [ duality ] ) . in this special euclidean situation",
    "it is immediate to realize that @xmath1-concavity of @xmath50 is equivalent to concavity ( in the classical sense ) of @xmath51 , hence @xmath52\\ ] ] is the gradient of a convex function .",
    "finally , notice that the assumption on @xmath12 can be sharpened ( see @xcite ) , assuming for instance that @xmath53 whenever @xmath54 has finite @xmath55-measure .",
    "this is due to the fact that the non - differentiability set of a concave function is @xmath56-finite with respect to @xmath55 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "also the assumption about second order moments can be relaxed , assuming only that the infimum of the ( mk ) problem with data @xmath57 is finite .",
    "the following result , due to r.mc cann @xcite , is much more recent .",
    "assume that @xmath58 is a @xmath59 , complete riemannian manifold with no boundary and @xmath44 is the riemannian distance .",
    "if @xmath12 , @xmath13 have finite second order moments and @xmath12 is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath60 there exists a unique optimal transport map @xmath16 .",
    "moreover there exists a @xmath1-concave potential @xmath61 such that @xmath62    this riemannian extension of theorem  [ tbrenier ] is non trivial , due to the fact that @xmath63 is not smooth in the large .",
    "the proof uses some semiconcavity estimates for @xmath63 and the fact that @xmath63 is @xmath64 for @xmath36 close to @xmath37 ( this is where the @xmath59 assumption on @xmath58 is needed ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the results of @xcite ( where the eikonal equation is read in local coordinates ) , based on the theory of viscosity solutions  see in particular theorem  5.3 of @xcite  allow to push mc cann s technique up to @xmath64 manifolds .",
    "can we go beyond riemannian manifolds in the existence theory ?",
    "a model case is given by stratified carnot groups endowed with the carnot - carathodory metric @xmath65 , as these spaces arise in a very natural way as limits of riemannian manifolds with respect to the gromov - hausdorff convergence ( see @xcite ) . at this moment a general strategy is still missing , but some preliminary investigations in the heisenberg group @xmath66 show that positive results analogous to the riemannian ones can be expected .",
    "the following result is proved in @xcite :    if @xmath67 and @xmath12 is a probability measure in @xmath66 absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath68 , then : + ( a ) there exists a unique optimal transport map @xmath16 , deriving from a @xmath1-concave potential @xmath50 ; + ( b ) if @xmath69 are riemannian left invariant metrics then mc cann s optimal transport maps @xmath70 relative to @xmath71 converge in measure to @xmath16 as @xmath72 .",
    "the restriction to @xmath66 , @xmath73 , arises from the fact that so far we have been able to carry on some explicit computations only for @xmath73 .",
    "we expect that this restriction could be removed .",
    "the proof of ( b ) is not direct , as mc cann s exponential representation @xmath74  degenerates \" as @xmath72 , because the injectivity radius of the approximating manifolds tends to @xmath75 .",
    "this is due to the fact that in cc metric spaces geodesics exist but are not unique , not even in the small .    finally ,",
    "if we replace @xmath1 by the square of the kornyi norm ( related to the fundamental solution of the kohn sub - laplacian ) , namely @xmath76 ( here we identify @xmath66 with @xmath77 ) then we are still able to prove existence in any heisenberg group @xmath66 .",
    "the proof uses some fine properties of @xmath78 functions on sub - riemannian groups @xcite .",
    "however , we ca nt hope for a riemannian approximation result , as the kornyi norm induces a metric @xmath79 which is not geodesic .",
    "it turns out that the geodesic metric associated to @xmath79 is a constant multiple of @xmath65 .",
    "-5 mm    in this section we consider the case when @xmath43 and the cost function @xmath1 is a distance . in this case both strategies a and b give only a partial information about the location of @xmath37 , for given @xmath36 .",
    "in particular it is not true that any optimal kantorovich plan @xmath20 is induced by a transport map . indeed ,",
    "if the first order moments of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are finite , the dual formulation provides us with a maximizing pair @xmath80 , with @xmath81 @xmath4-lipschitz . if @xmath82 and the distance is induced by a norm @xmath83 , this provides the implication @xmath84 at any differentiability point of @xmath85 . here",
    "we consider the natural duality map between covectors and vectors given by @xmath86 the most favourable case is when the norm is strictly convex ( e.g. the euclidean norm ) : in this situation the @xmath87 operator is single - valued and we recover from ( [ nonno ] ) an information on the direction of transportation , i.e. @xmath88 , but not on the length of transportation .",
    "if the norm is not strictly convex ( e.g. the @xmath89 or @xmath90 norm ) then even the information on the direction of transportation , encoded in @xmath88 , is partial .",
    "the first attempt to bypass these difficulties came with the work of v.n.sudakov @xcite , who claimed to have a solution for any distance cost function induced by a norm .",
    "sudakov s approach is based on a clever decomposition of the space @xmath91 in affine regions with variable dimension where the kantorovich dual potential @xmath85 associated to the transport problem is an affine function .",
    "his strategy is to solve the transport problem in any of these regions , eventually getting an optimal transport map just by gluing all these transport maps .",
    "an essential ingredient in his proof is proposition  78 , where he states that , if @xmath92 , then the conditional measures induced by the decomposition are absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure ( of the correct dimension ) .",
    "however , it turns out that this property is not true in general even for the simplest decomposition , i.e. the decomposition in segments : g.alberti , b.kirchheim and d.preiss found an example of a compact faily of pairwise disjoint open segments in @xmath93 such that the family @xmath58 of their midpoints has strictly positive lebesgue measure ( the construction is a variant of previous examples due to a.s.besicovitch and d.g.larman , see also @xcite and @xcite ) . in this case , choosing @xmath94 , the conditional measures induced by the decomposition are dirac masses .",
    "therefore it is clear that this kind of counterexamples should be ruled out by some kind of additional `` regularity '' property of the decomposition . in this way",
    "the sudakov strategy would be fully rigorous . as noticed in @xcite",
    ", this regularity comes for free only in the case @xmath95 , using the fact that transport rays do not cross in their interior .",
    "several years later , l.c.evans and w.gangbo made a remarkable progress in @xcite , showing by differential methods the existence of a transport map , under the assumption that @xmath96 , that the two measures are absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath46 and that their densities are lipschitz functions with compact support . the missing piece of information about the length of transportation is recovered by a @xmath97-laplacian approximation @xmath98 obtaining in the limit as @xmath99 a nonnegative function @xmath100 and a @xmath4-lipschitz function @xmath85 solving @xmath101    the diffusion coefficient @xmath102 in the pde above plays a special role in the theory .",
    "indeed , one can show ( see @xcite ) that the measure @xmath103 , the so - called _ transport density _ , can be represented in several different way , and in particular as @xmath104\\right)\\,d\\gamma(x , y ) \\qquad\\forall\\hbox{\\rm $ b\\subset { \\bf r}^n$ borel}\\ ] ] for some optimal planning @xmath20 .",
    "notice that the total mass of @xmath56 is @xmath105 , the total work done and the meaning of @xmath106 is the work done _ within _ @xmath54 during the transport process .",
    "this representation of the transport density has been introduced by g.bouchitt and g.buttazzo in @xcite , who showed that the a constant multiple of the transport density is a solution of their so - called mass optimization problem .",
    "later , in @xcite , it was shown that there is actually a 1 - 1 correspondence between solutions of the mass optimization problem and transport densities , defined as in ( [ freeze ] ) .",
    "one can also show ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) that @xmath56 is unique ( unlike @xmath20 ) if either @xmath12 or @xmath13 are absolutely continuous .",
    "moreover , the nonlinear operator mapping @xmath107 into @xmath108 maps @xmath109 into @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",
    "coming back to the problem of the existence of optimal transport maps with euclidean distance @xmath112 ( or , more generally , with a distance induced by a @xmath64 and uniformly convex norm ) , the first existence results for general absolutely continuous measures @xmath57 with compact support have been independently obtained by l.caffarelli , m.feldman and r.mc cann in @xcite and by n.trudinger and l.wang in @xcite .",
    "afterwards , the author estabilished in @xcite the existence of an optimal transport map assuming only that the initial measure @xmath12 is absolutely continuous , and the results of @xcite and @xcite have been extended to a riemannian setting in @xcite .",
    "all these proofs involve basically a sudakov decomposition in transport rays , but the technical implementation of the idea is different from paper to paper : for instance in @xcite a local change of variable is made , so that transport rays become parallel and fubini theorem , in place of abstract disintegration theorems for measures , can be used . the proof in @xcite ,",
    "instead , uses the co - area formula to show that absolute continuity with respect to lebesgue measure is stable under disintegration .",
    "the following result @xcite is a slight improvement of @xcite , where existence of an optimal transport map was estabilished but not the stability property .",
    "the result holds under regularity and uniform convexity assumptions for the norm @xmath83 .",
    "[ tcaff ] let @xmath113 be with compact support , with @xmath92 , and let @xmath114 be the unique optimal transport maps relative to the costs @xmath115 .",
    "then @xmath114 converge as @xmath116 to an optimal transport map @xmath16 for @xmath117 .    the proof is based only the fact that any plan @xmath118 , limit of some sequence of plans @xmath119 , is not only optimal for the ( mk ) problem , but also for the _ secondary _ one @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes the class of all optimal plannings for the kantorovich problem ( the entropy function in ( [ corea ] ) comes from the taylor expansion of @xmath122 around @xmath123 ) .",
    "it turns out that this additional minimality property selects a unique plan induced by a transport @xmath16 and , a posteriori , @xmath16 is the same map built in @xcite .",
    "a class of counterexamples built in @xcite shows that the absolute continuity assumption on @xmath12 can not be weakened , unlike the strictly convex case .",
    "this `` variational '' procedure seems to select extremal elements of @xmath26 in a very effective way .",
    "this phenomenon is apparent in view of the following result @xcite , which holds for all `` crystalline '' norms @xmath83 ( i.e. norms whose unit sphere is contained in finitely many hyperplanes ) .",
    "[ tcaff1 ] let @xmath113 be as in theorem  [ tcaff ] and let @xmath114 be the unique optimal transport maps relative to the costs @xmath124 then @xmath114 converge as @xmath116 to an optimal transport map @xmath16 for @xmath117 .      some borderline cases between `` crystalline '' norms and `` euclidean '' norms apparently ca nt be attacked by any of the existing techniques .",
