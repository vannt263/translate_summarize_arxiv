    "the formation history of galaxies has been extensively studied in terms of the evolution of their stellar mass @xcite .",

    "while the observed stellar mass density of the galaxies shows significant and rapid growth along the time at @xmath12 , at least @xmath13 % of the present - day stellar mass in the galaxies is observed at @xmath7 @xcite , which seems also true for the massive galaxies with @xmath14 @xcite .    where and how were they formed ?",
    "the biased galaxy formation models in a universe dominated by cold dark matter suggest that galaxy formation preferentially occurs in regions with relatively high density at the larger scale @xcite .",
    "recent results based on optical wide - field imaging reveal that high - redshift star - forming galaxies indeed show very strong clustering largely biased to the expected underlying mass distribution ( e.g. , @xcite , ) , which is also true for near - infrared ( nir)-selected massive galaxies @xcite .    at @xmath15 , individual large - scale high - density regions of the galaxies have also been discovered @xcite .",
    "many of these fields are , however , identified as an excess in the number density of rest - frame uv bright galaxies , such as ly@xmath8 emitters ( laes ) , lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) or their analogues .",
    "the question is how much of the stellar mass has already formed and assembled in such high density region of star - forming galaxies at @xmath16 . in other words , we would like to see whether the structure traced by the star formation activity is correlated ( or anti - correlated ) with the structure traced by the stellar mass .    in this paper , we present the results of @xmath17- , @xmath18- and @xmath10-band imaging of the @xmath0 proto - cluster region in and around the ssa22 field ( @xcite , ; @xcite ) using multi - object infrared camera and spectrograph ( moircs ) @xcite equipped with the 8.2 m subaru telescope .",
    "the wide field of view of moircs allowed us to observe such proto - cluster regions efficiently .",
    "the proto - cluster was first discovered by @xcite as the excess of lbgs .",
    "later wider - field and deeper narrow - band observations revealed that the overdense region of lbgs is a part of a large - scale high density structure of laes , which is extended over @xmath19 60 mpc in a comoving scale @xcite .",

    "the rest - frame optical wavelengths puts more weight in their stellar mass content , allowing us to study the mass and population of the stars associated with them .",
    "the nature of dusty star - forming objects in such high - density structure can also be examined by the nir data .",

    "we investigated whether massive and/or mature galaxies have already formed in the proto - cluster which is characterized by the overdensity of star - forming galaxies .",
    "we examined the distribution of the @xmath6-selected galaxies by using the simple color cut for drgs as well as the photo - z selection .",
    "the surface number density of drgs with @xmath144 in the field was 1.3 arcmin@xmath145 at @xmath146 .",
    "while it was not likely that the density of drgs have the similar excess as seen for lbgs at the volume , we found significant evidence that more than a few galaxies with the stellar mass @xmath147 m@xmath109 , exist in vicinity of , or might be associated with , the labs .",
    "we also investigated all the @xmath10-band counterparts which have the consistent photometric redshift not only for the labs but also for the other objects at @xmath0 in the field .",
    "we found that 88% of the labs have the plausible @xmath10-band candidates .",
    "the sum of the stellar mass of the galaxies possibly associated with labs correlated with the luminosity and surface brightness of the labs , which implied that the origin of ly@xmath8 emission must be closely related with the massive galaxy formation phenomena .",
    "the most luminous labs , lab1 and lab2 , had the @xmath6-selected counterparts with @xmath148 m@xmath109 .",
    "in addition , the marginal density excess of drgs and the photo - z selected objects was found around the most luminous labs , lab1 and lab2 .",
    "our results suggest that labs are related to the formation of massive galaxies and a certain amount of evolved galaxies with @xmath149 are being formed in the central part of the high density region of star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "we are witnessing a stage when significant amount of the stars are being formed in the central part of the growing large - scale proto - cluster at @xmath0 .",
