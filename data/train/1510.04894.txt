    "the first subject of this article is the embedded resolutions of `` simple '' singularities , called also rational double point surface singularities .",
    "they are called simple because they have no moduli ( i.e. a hypersurface singularity with the same topological type of one of these singularities is analytically isomorphic to it ) @xcite .",
    "but at the same time , they are simple from a resolution of singularities point of view , i.e. easy to resolve .",
    "the traditional approach to resolve singularities is to blow up at smooth centers in order to make an invariant drop . this invariant takes values in a discrete ordered set with a smallest element ( which detects smoothness ) .",
    "it should not only detect smoothness , but also be easy to compute so that its behavior can be followed after the blowing ups . in this article",
    ", we adopt a different strategy to resolve a simple singularity @xmath1 we construct an embedded toric resolution of @xmath2 this construction is based on a deep invariant , the set * ec * ( essential components ) of irreducible components of the jet schemes satisfying some natural properties .",
    "recall that ( see section 2 ) for @xmath3 the @xmath4th jet scheme of a variety @xmath5 parametrizes morphisms @xmath6/(t^{m+1})\\longrightarrow x.$ ] these are finite dimensional approximations of the space of arcs which parametrize germs of curves drawn on @xmath7 actually the geometry of the @xmath4th jet schemes is intimately related with the geometry of the set of arcs in a smooth ambient space containing @xmath5 and which have `` contact '' with @xmath5 larger than @xmath8 this explains in parts why while the arc space of @xmath5 detect information about abstract resolution of singularities @xcite , jet schemes detect information about embedded resolution of singularities @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the other subject that this article considers is the minimality of embedded resolutions of singularities .",
    "in contrast with the abstract resolution case , there is no `` universal '' minimal embedded resolution for surface singularities .",
    "therefore we need to make more precise this notion .",
    "actually , the embedding resolution of @xmath9 that we construct is toric and is obtained by considering , using jet schemes , a particular regular subdivision of the newton dual fan @xmath10 associated with the defining equation of @xmath5 at the singularity(see section 3 for the definition of @xmath10 ) . since the singularities that we are considering are newton non - degenerate ( see section 3 ) , regular subdivisions of @xmath10 give toric embedded resolutions of @xmath9 ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that an abstract resolution of singularities of the toric variety @xmath11 defined by the fan @xmath10 gives an embedded toric resolution of @xmath2 but the toric variety @xmath11 is of dimension @xmath12 and hence thanks to a theorem by bouvier and gonzalez - sprinberg @xcite , we know that there exists a toric resolution of singularities of @xmath11 where all the irreducible divisors of the exceptional locus are essential , i.e. the centers of the divisorial valuations associated with these divisors give irreducible components of the exceptional locus of any other toric resolution of singularities of @xmath13 we call such a resolution of singularities a minimal toric resolution ; in @xcite , it is called @xmath14desingularization ; we call a toric embedded resolution of @xmath9 minimal if it corresponds to a minimal toric resolution of @xmath13 note that in general , a minimal toric embedded resolution of singularities is not unique , but the divisorial valuations associated with the irreducible divisors of its exceptional locus are the same for all minimal toric embedded resolution of singularities .",
    "we say that these last divisorial valuations are embedded essential .",
    "+ we will prove that the toric embedded resolutions of @xmath9 that we construct from jet schemes is minimal for all simple singularities except for @xmath15 in particular the set of essential components of the jet schemes of simple singularities ( except for @xmath0 ) is in a bijective correspondence with the set of embedded essential divisorial valuations .",
    "this can be thought as a solution of an embedded nash problem . +",
    "the choice of this class of singularities is related to the following reasons : + first , for @xmath16 big enough the number of irreducible components of their @xmath4th is constant , this simplifies the classification of the irreducible components we are interested in , when @xmath16 varies .",
    "this is not the case in general @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these singularities are newton non - degenerate with respect to their newton polyhedron , and therefore they have a toric embedded resolution , see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite",
    ". defining the class of irreducible components of jet schemes , mentioned above , is more subtle for newton degenerate singularities @xcite .",
    "this is related to a conjecture of teissier on embedding any singularity in such way that it can be resolved by a toric morphism @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "+ we would like to thank shihoko ishii , monique lejeune - jalabert , patrick popescu - pampu and bernard teissier for several discussions about this article .",
    "in this section , after giving some preliminaries on jet schemes , we recall from @xcite the structure of jet schemes of rational double point singularities and we extract from it some informations about particular irreducible components of these jet schemes . these informations will be used in the next section to obtain the canonical resolution of these singularities .",

    "on the other hand , since we are interested in toric resolution , the exceptional locus of such a resolution will be defined as the inverse image of the complement of the torus , i.e the coordinate hyperplanes .",
