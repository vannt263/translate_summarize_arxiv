    "significant progress has been made in the last few years in detecting infrared galaxies at high redshift and characterizing their nature , evolution , and contribution to the cosmic background .",

    "therefore , deep mid - ir observations using mips on spitzer offer a new and efficient probe of dusty galaxies at high redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "spitzer @xmath14 m surveys are expected to detect all of the isocam and most of the scuba / mambo sources , bridge the gap between these two populations in redshift and luminosity , and search for entirely new categories of sources .",
    "the first non  proprietary spitzer survey is the first look survey ( fls ) , covering 3.7 square degrees in seven bands .",
    "more than 18000 sources are detected to the @xmath15 sensitivity of @xmath16 at @xmath11 .",
    "combining deep optical , spitzer irac @xmath17 , and mips @xmath11 data , @xcite have obtained the first characterization of a large sample of @xmath11selected sources .",
    "these sources have colors ranging from those of relatively low  redshift , fairly inactive galaxies to extremely red @xmath18 and @xmath19 colors that can only be explained by luminous obscured starbursts or agn at high redshift .",
    "the available color information is not unique for identifying the nature of these objects , however , and the applicability of the local sed templates has to be critically examined .",
    "this is particularly true for the rare and extreme @xmath11selected objects that the fls sample includes due to its large size . in this letter",
    "we report on mambo 1.2 mm observations of such rare 24@xmath7m - bright but optically faint sources , providing a constraint on the cold dust contribution to their spectral energy distributions that is essential for characterizing their nature and their relation to other populations of high  redshift infrared galaxies .",
    "@xcite used spitzer mid - ir and ground - based optical photometry for a first characterization of 24@xmath7 m sources from the fls .",
    "we have selected for 1.2 mm photometry a subset of bright ( s@xmath201mjy ) sources that are optically faint , as evidenced by a 24@xmath7 m to optical ` color ' @xmath21 of at least 1 ( r@xmath2222.5 for s@xmath231mjy ) .",
    "we have chosen 39 of the 145 sources meeting these criteria , and added one with a slightly lower r(24,0.7 ) .",
    "we refer to these sources as ` obscured 24@xmath7 m sources ' .",
    "the selection covers the full color spread of the @xcite objects ( fig .",
    "[ fig : yancolor ] ) , preferring objects brightest at 24@xmath7 m , and aiming for a large overlap with fls objects studied by spitzer mid - ir spectroscopy ( * ? ? ? * and in preparation ) .",
    "objects were selected using the @xcite flux catalogs . since then , slightly revised 24@xmath7 m and 8@xmath7 m fluxes ( m. lacy et al . in preparation ) have become available which we adopt in the following discussion .",
    "observations were spread over the pool observing sessions at the iram 30 m telescope in fall / winter 2004/2005 , using the 117 element version of the max planck millimeter bolometer ( mambo ) array @xcite operating at a wavelength of 1.2 mm .",
    "on - off observations were typically obtained in blocks of 6 scans of 20 subscans each , and repeated in later observing nights until reaching noise near 0.66mjy or a 5@xmath24 detection .",
    "the median 1.2 mm noise level reached for the sample is 0.59mjy ( range 0.35 to 0.82mjy ) .",
    "the data were reduced with standard procedures in the mopsic package developed by r.  zylka , using the default calibration files for these two pool periods .",
    "table  [ tab : fluxes ] lists the resulting 1.2 mm fluxes and their statistical uncertainties .",
    "three sources are detected individually at more than 5@xmath24 with 1.2 mm fluxes between 2.3 and 5.8mjy , and four more at 3@xmath24 to 5@xmath24 .",
    "the total 40 object sample is well detected statistically at a mean flux of 0.74@xmath250.09mjy ( table  [ tab : detstat ] ) . to investigate a dependence on the mid - ir / optical colors",
    ", we have grouped the sample in four color ` quadrants ' separated at r(24,0.7)=1.5 and and r(24,8)=0.5 . due to the sample selection , these quadrants contain similar numbers of objects by design .",
    "table  [ tab : detstat ] shows clear trends in the mean 1.2 mm fluxes for these subsamples .",
    "objects redder in r(24,0.7 ) have significantly higher mean 1.2 mm flux , and a trend may also be present with r(24,8 ) .",
    "values quoted in table  [ tab : detstat ] refer to means of the individual source data weighted by the inverse of the noise squared .",
    "very similar values are obtained for equal weight means .",
    "the trend in the mean fluxes agrees with the @xmath5 detection of 7/24 objects at r(24,0.7)@xmath221.5 vs. 0/16 at bluer color . using the formalism of @xcite",
    ", this implies that the two groups are different at 2.9@xmath24 significance . the distribution of 1.2 mm vs. 24@xmath7 m fluxes , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mambo24scatter ] , is inconsistent with a single flux ratio for the entire sample , or for the subsample with r(24,0.7)@xmath221.5 .",
    "this is expected given the sample selection , and emphasizes that the mean values quoted in table  [ tab : detstat ] are formed over ( sub)samples that can have noticeable spreads of intrinsic properties .",
    "our color selection implies that these objects must be heavily obscured and/or at considerable redshift .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : yanratios ] , showing that even spectral energy distributions similar to ` standard ' dusty starbursts like m82 fail to reproduce for plausible redshifts r(24,0.7)@xmath221.2 , i.e. the vast majority of our sample .",
    "r(24,0.7 ) will be yet lower for seds of uv - brighter starbursts like ngc 7714 .",
    "seds similar to the most optically obscured local ultraluminous infrared galaxies like arp220 reach r(24,0.7)@xmath221.5 for redshifts around 2 , but even stronger emission at observed 24@xmath7 m ( rest - frame 8@xmath7 m for z@xmath262 ) relative to the shorter wavelengths is needed to reproduce the most extreme spitzer objects .",
    "the same is true for the sed of the well studied less luminous but extremely obscured galaxy , ngc 4418 . for this object ,",
    "both the 8@xmath7 m and the 0.7@xmath7 m flux are host dominated at z@xmath271.5 . varying the nucleus to host ratio moves the source diagonally in fig .",
    "[ fig : yanratios ] .",
    "the millimeter observations provide a crucial test of the analogy to local seds .",
    "[ fig : mambo24 ] shows the expected ratio of 1.2 mm and 24@xmath7 m flux density as a function of redshift , again for m82 , arp220 , and ngc 4418 seds .",
    "the seven objects with individual mambo detections are reasonably close to the properties of these local templates . at @xmath28 , they are in a range still consistent with local infrared galaxy seds redshifted to z@xmath292 , assuming a relatively high optical obscuration or modest additional mid - ir emission . in contrast ,",
    "comparison of the templates to the mean values for the obscured spitzer sources ( table  [ tab : detstat ] ) shows that in fact neither sed provides a good representation of the mean properties of our 24@xmath7 m sources .",
    "arp 220 and ngc 4418like seds , which were in a reasonable range of the optical / mid - ir colors , predict by far too strong 1.2 mm flux for plausible redshifts .",
    "m82-like seds are closer to the observed mm to mir ratio , but predict too bright optical counterparts as noted above .",
    "we conclude from the analysis of mean properties that the sample of obscured 24@xmath7 m contains many sources that are not well fit by these local infrared luminous galaxy sed templates .",
    "relative to the templates , they require additional rest frame mid - ir emission , due to a component that is both warm ( to avoid overproducing mm emission ) and optically obscured .",
    "another way of phrasing the need for ` additional rest frame mid - ir emission ' is to state that the overall infrared sed must be warm to hot , without a dominant rest frame far - ir peak . in a strongly simplifying single temperature blackbody fit",
    ", the observed 1.2 mm to 24@xmath7 m flux density ratio corresponds to a temperature of @xmath2975k , i.e. intrinsic t@xmath27200k if at z@xmath292 , and luminosities of the order of 10@xmath30l@xmath31 .",
    "the warm temperature is suggestive of a strong agn contribution .",
    "the sed of the most luminous radio - quiet local quasar , pds 456 @xcite is able to fit the 1.2mm/24@xmath7 m ratio for plausible redshifts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mambo24 ] ) , but this type 1 object is too bright in the uv / optical to explain the mid - ir / optical colors for our sample . that more obscured agn may be able to meet that constraint can be illustrated using the _ nuclear _ sed of the classical seyfert 2 ngc 1068 .",
    "its nuclear fir / submm emission can currently be separated from the host only at 450@xmath7 m with s@xmath32jy @xcite , but this can be combined with the mid - ir agn continuum @xcite and the rest frame uv taken from ned , to conclude that such an agn sed would satisfy the criteria for both faintness at 1.2 mm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mambo24 ] ) and optical obscuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig : yancolor ] ) .",
    "agn in obscured 24@xmath7 m sources must suffer intermediate obscuration , sufficient to suppress the rest frame uv / optical but not moving too much energy into far - ir re - emission .",
    "separation from host emission and spectral characterization of the rest frame far - ir emission is currently incomplete for local obscured agn , but objects like iras f00183 - 00183 @xcite do have more favourable mid- to far - ir ratios than ngc 4418 and may fit the seds of some obscured 24@xmath7 m sources .",
    "low 1.2mm/24@xmath7 m flux ratios can also be obtained for low redshift ( z@xmath331 ) infrared star - forming galaxy seds .",
    "as already noted , this is ruled out for the adopted templates , by the failure to meet r(24,0.7)@xmath221 at such redshifts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : yanratios ] ) .",
    "contamination by similar sources may occur at the low r(24,0.7 ) end of the mambo sample if the scatter in rest frame seds extends towards smaller optical / mid - ir flux ratios .",
    "this scenario becomes progressively unlikely for the r(24,0.7)@xmath221.5 sources with weak 1.2 mm emission .",
    "@xcite use the likely compactness of star formation events in high redshift infrared galaxies to argue for seds of blue compact dwarf galaxies as local analogues .",
    "the most extreme case , sbs 0335 - 052 , shows an absorbed warm mid - ir continuum @xcite .",
    "while this possible analogy has to be mentioned , it is unclear to which extent such low metallicity dwarfs can relate to the luminous obscured 24@xmath7 m sources . sbs 0335 - 052 , in addition to its mid - ir emission , has strong unobscured optical / uv emission which would place it far off the color selection of obscured 24@xmath7 m sources .",
    "rest frame submm information is not available to place sbs 0335 - 052 on fig .",
    "[ fig : mambo24 ] .",
    "( sub)millimeter galaxies ( smgs ) are the best studied pre - spitzer population of z@xmath34 infrared galaxies , inferred to be objects at z@xmath292.5 with roughly ulirg like seds but much higher luminosity .",
    "optical to mid - ir colors of bright and obscured 24@xmath7 m sources ( figs .  [",
    "fig : yancolor],[fig : yanratios ] ) and their low surface density compared to that of smgs could have been consistent with an identification of the yet more extreme luminosity end of the smg population as obscured 24@xmath7 m sources .",
    "the small ratio of 1.2 mm and 24@xmath7 m emission clearly argues against this being true for the majority of the spitzer sources .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have reported 24@xmath7 m photometry of smgs from scuba and mambo blank field and radio preselected surveys .",
    "they find much higher @xmath35 , with median @xmath36 , clearly inconsistent with smgs and obscured spitzer sources having similar sed shapes and redshifts .",
    "again , the spitzer objects with individual mambo detections are closer to the smg properties .",
    "@xcite discuss selection effects against warm seds in the smg population and the potential of spitzer in avoiding them . in a related effort ,",
    "@xcite have obtained spectroscopic redshifts of optically faint @xmath7jy radio sources without submm detections , inferring under the assumption of the radio  far - ir correlation that these must represent a population of ultraluminous star - forming z@xmath292.2 galaxies characterized by intrinsically warm or hot dust continua .",
    "little is known at present about the rest - frame mid - ir properties of these sources , making an assessment of the overlap with obscured 24@xmath7 m sources difficult .",
    "@xcite report faint 24@xmath7 m fluxes or nondetections of several optically faint radio sources that have scuba 850@xmath7 m flux upper limits of order 8mjy .",
    "if these results are representative for the full population of optically faint radio sources , then their possible warm fir seds can not extend down into the mid - ir , and their nature must be different from the obscured 24@xmath7 m sources .",
    "if , for example , their radio emission is agn boosted , their dust emission may be comparatively weak at all wavelengths .",
    "mid - ir spectroscopy will play a key role in identifying the nature of the rare obscured 24@xmath7 m sources and their strong mid - ir emission . @xcite and @xcite have reported the first spitzer irs spectroscopy of such sources , finding a predominance of continua and absorbed continua and indications for starburst pah emission in a subset of sources .",
    "the obscured continuum spectra , which are seen only in a small minority of local infrared galaxies @xcite but a third to half of the obscured 24@xmath7 m sources in the subsamples already published by @xcite and @xcite , indicate heavily embedded energy sources that might be agn .",
    "redshift estimates , where they can be derived , suggest z@xmath291.53 . as for the photometric evidence , comparison to initial spitzer spectroscopy of smgs which shows pahs @xcite suggests that the two populations have only modest overlap , and that there is a large contribution of warm and possibly agn like sources to the obscured 24@xmath7 m population .",
    "if a good part of the bright obscured 24@xmath7 m sources contain luminous high z agn they will represent a significant component of the high redshift agn population .",
    "our mambo sample is a subset of about 150 similar objects ( fig .",
    "[ fig : yancolor ] ) detected over the 3.7 square degree fls field .",
    "if many of these objects are @xmath37l@xmath31 agn at z@xmath291.5 - 3 their comoving number density will be of the order @xmath38mpc@xmath39 , comparable to that of similar bolometric luminosity ( m@xmath40 ) optically selected quasars @xcite .",
    "the ongoing characterization of their redshift distribution and seds will shed more light on this issue .",
    "based on observations carried out with the iram 30 m telescope and with the spitzer space telescope .",
    "we thank the iram staff for support and advice , all pool observers for their help in obtaining the observations , and the referee for helpful comments .",
