    "a rare group of hydrogen - deficient ( h - deficient ) and carbon rich supergiants in the order of their increasing effective temperatures are : hydrogen deficient carbon ( hdc ) stars , rcoronae borealis ( rcb ) stars , and extreme helium ( ehe ) stars @xcite .",
    "the origin and evolution of these peculiar stars is not yet clear .",
    "the distances are not accurately known to any of the galactic h - deficient stars .",
    "the position of a star on the hr - diagram gives us an idea about its evolution and possibly its origin .",
    "to place these stars on the hr - diagram , a survey was conducted to identify new h - deficient stars in the most massive and brightest galactic globular cluster ( ggc ) : @xmath0centauri .    the observed large spread in the metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) and the other abundance anomalies of @xmath0cen cluster stars @xcite including the existence of multiple stellar populations , the he - normal and he - enhanced or h - poor @xcite , makes it an enigmatic ggc .",
    "the recent spectroscopic studies of @xcite and @xcite confirms the existence of the he - enhanced stars in @xmath0cen and ngc 2808 , respectively .",
    "hence , our survey also explores the h - deficiency or the he - enhancement in the sample giants of @xmath0cen .",
    "our survey is based on the strmgren photometric studies of red giant stars in @xmath0cen by @xcite .",
    "stars in the ggcs are expected to be homogeneous in metallicities ( [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "but , there are a few ggcs which show a large dispersion in their metallicities . one of them being the ggc @xmath0cen , with a range in [ fe / h ] : @xmath22.5 @xmath3 [ fe / h ] @xmath3 @xmath40.5 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this spread in metallicity , which is not as expected for a ggc , is possibly an indication for the presence of h - deficient stars in @xmath0cen .",
    "note that , the metal lines are much stronger in the spectra of the h - deficient supergiants : the rcb and the hdc stars , when compared with those observed in the spectra of f- and g - type normal supergiants .",
    "this is attributed to the lower opacity in the atmosphere due to h - deficiency .",
    "hence , h - deficient stars appear metal richer than they actually are @xcite . our suspicion was that the metal rich giants of @xmath0cen may possibly be h - poor . in this survey the priority was given to the giants in the metallicity range : @xmath20.5 @xmath5 [ fe / h ] @xmath3 @xmath40.5 .",
    "however , for the sake of the completeness , irrespective of the metallicity , all the giants , brighter than 14.5 y magnitude ( strmgren visual ) were considered for our study .",
    "the other criterion that was applied to increase the probability of finding h - deficient stars in our sample was the ( j - h)@xmath6 and ( h - k)@xmath6 colours ( ir - colours ) . the rcb and the hdc stars distribution in the ir - colours plot is distinct from the normal dwarfs and giants @xcite .",
    "the j , h and k magnitudes and the corresponding galactic dust reddening for extinction correction were adopted from two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) catalogue and nasa / ipac infrared science archive , respectively .",
    "note that , for observations , all the metal rich giants ( + 0.5 @xmath5 [ fe / h ] @xmath5 @xmath20.5 ) were selected , irrespective of their ir - colours ",
    "these were 130 in number .",
    "however , the metal poor giants ( @xmath20.5 @xmath5 [ fe / h ] @xmath5 @xmath22.5 ) selected for observations , with ir - colours like rcb stars , were 40 in number . though , the sample of red giants from the core of @xmath0cen were not included in our sample ( to avoid confusion in identifying the giants in the crowded field ) , many of the giants in the periphery were double or multiple objects .",
    "the giants which were not clearly resolved were excluded from our observations .",
    "hence , only 34 of the 130 metal rich stars and about 11 of the 40 metal poor stars were selected for observations .",
    "low - resolution optical spectra for these selected red giants of @xmath0cen were obtained from the 2.34 m vainu bappu telescope ( vbt ) , vainu bappu observatory , equipped with the optomechanics research spectrograph @xcite and 1k @xmath7 1k ccd camera .",
    "these spectra obtained using 600 l / mm grating centered at h@xmath8 line at 6563   were at a resolution of about 8 .",
    "the data reduction and analyses were carried out using the iraf ( image reduction and analysis facility ) software package .",
    "the observed spectra of all the program stars were continuum normalized .",
    "the region of the spectrum ( having maximum flux ) free of absorption lines is treated as the continuum point , and a smooth curve passing through these points is defined as the continuum . the well defined continuum in the spectrum of the sample metal poor giant , and in the spectrum of arcturus with very high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ,",
    "is used as a reference for judging the continuum for the sample metal rich stars in the wavelength window 4900 - 5400a including the mgb triplet and the complete mgh band .",
    "the analyses of the observed spectra of the program stars were carried out based on the strengths of the blue degraded ( 0,0 ) mgh band extending from 5330 to 4950 , with the band head at 5211 , and the mg@xmath1 lines at 5167.32 , 5172.68  and 5183.60 . based on the strengths of these features in the observed spectra ,",
    "three groups were identified in our sample : ( i ) the metal rich giants with strong mg@xmath1 lines and the mgh band , ( ii ) the metal poor giants with weak mg@xmath1 lines and no mgh band , and ( iii ) the metal rich giants with strong mg@xmath1 lines , but no mgh band . to analyze the strengths of the mgh band in the observed spectra of sample stars , the stars with similar ( j - k)@xmath6 colours ( @xmath9(j - k)@xmath6@xmath10@xmath110.1 ) , and y magnitudes ( @xmath9y@xmath10@xmath110.5 ) , that represent the effective temperatures ( @xmath12 ) and surface gravities ( log@xmath13 ) , respectively , were selected .",
    "the spectra of stars having similar y magnitude and ( j - k)@xmath6 colours were then compared with each other . from this comparison",
    "four stars were identified having weaker or absent mgh band than expected .",
    "two stars : 178243 and 73170 are from the first group showing the strong mg@xmath1 lines , but weaker mgh band than expected for their stellar parameters ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the other two stars : 262788 and 193804 are from the third group showing relatively strong mg@xmath1 lines , but absent mgh band not as expected for their stellar parameters line strength makes the latter appear stronger in the first group than the third group . ]",
    "( see figure 2 ) .",
    "judging by the observed strengths of the mg@xmath1 lines and the presence / absence of the mgh band expected for their stellar parameters , the spectra of the giants 178243 , 73170 , 262788 and 193804 , suggest that their atmospheres are relatively h - poor .",
    "hence , to confirm this suggestion , the observed strengths of the mgh bands were further analyzed by synthesizing the spectra of these four stars along with the program stars of first and third groups for their adopted stellar parameters .",
    "note that , observed spectra with s / n @xmath5 60 were analyzed .",
    "a literature survey was done for the high - resolution spectroscopic studies of the program stars .",
    "many of the program stars were found in @xcite .",
    "the stellar parameters : @xmath12 , log@xmath13 , and [ fe / h ] for the program stars were adopted from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 for the program stars were also determined using their photometric colours : ( j - h)@xmath6 , ( j - k)@xmath6 , and ( b - y)@xmath6 using @xcite s empirical calibrations .",
    "the log@xmath13 for the program stars were determined using the standard relation .",
    "these determined @xmath12 and log@xmath13 values are within an agreement of @xmath11200k , and @xmath110.2 ( cgs units ) , and with a mean difference of @xmath11100k , and @xmath110.1 ( cgs units ) , respectively , with those determined by @xcite .",
    "hence , we have used our estimates of the @xmath12 and log@xmath13 for the stars not available in @xcite .",
    "the spectra were synthesized from 5100-5200that includes the mg@xmath1 lines and the ( 0 , 0 ) mgh band . for synthesizing the spectra ,",
    "the atomic lines were compiled from the standard atomic data sources , and all the atomic lines identified by @xcite were included .",
    "the ( 0 , 0 ) mgh molecular line list was adopted from @xcite .",
    "synthetic spectra were generated by combining the lte spectral line analysis / synthesis code moog @xcite , and the atlas9 @xcite plane parallel , line - blanketed lte model atmospheres with convective overshoot .",
    "spectrum of arcturus , a typical red giant , was synthesized to validate the adopted @xmath14-values of the atomic / molecular lines . using the spectrum synthesis code , @xmath15 in moog",
    ", the high resolution optical spectrum of arcturus was synthesized for the stellar parameters and the abundances given by @xcite .",
    "the synthesized spectrum was convolved with a gaussian profile with a width that represents the broadening due to macroturbulence and the instrumental profile .",
    "minimal adjustments were made to the abundances of the atomic lines to obtain the best fit to the observed high - resolution optical spectrum of arcturus @xcite .",
    "the changes in the log @xmath14 values were not more than 0.1 dex .",
    "a reasonably good fit was obtained to the mgh molecular lines for the adopted isotopic values from @xcite .",
    "the synthesized high - resolution spectrum was further convolved by a gaussian profile of width of about 8 , to match with the observed low - resolution arcturus spectrum obtained from vbt .",
    "a good match of the synthesized arcturus spectrum to the observed , both high- and low - resolution spectra , validates the adopted line list for the adopted stellar parameters of arcturus .",
    "these checks on published analysis of arcturus are taken as evidence that our implementation of the code moog , the lte models , and the adopted line list were successful for the syntheses of the red giants spectra .",
    "hence , the spectra of the program stars were synthesized following the above procedure .",
    "the synthesized spectra , for their adopted stellar parameters and abundances , were then compared with the observed spectra . from the studies of @xcite , the average [ mg / fe ]",
    "= ( mg / fe)@xmath16 @xmath2 ( mg / fe)@xmath17 for the red giants of @xmath0cen is about @xmath40.4dex over a metallicity range : [ fe / h]=@xmath22.0 to @xmath20.7 . hence , in our synthesis the [ mg / fe]=@xmath40.4 dex was adopted initially . since the subordinate lines of mgh band at about 5167  are blended with the saturated mg@xmath1 lines , the subordinate lines of mgh band in the wavelength window 51205160were given more weight in our synthesis .",
    "the best fit of the spectrum synthesized for the adopted stellar parameters to the observed was obtained by adjusting the mg abundance , and therefore estimating the mg abundance = log @xmath18 @xmath4 12.0 , this convention is used throughout this study . ] for the program star ( see figure 3 for example ) .",
    "note that , the derived mg abundances are in excellent agreement with the two common stars in @xcite study .",
    "the adopted stellar parameters and the derived mg abundances for the program stars ( first and third group ) are given in table 1 .",
    "for all the normal first and third group stars , our derived mg abundances ( mean [ mg / fe]@xmath10@xmath40.3 dex ) for their adopted stellar parameters , were as expected for the red giants of @xmath0cen , with just four exceptions .",
    "these four exceptions are : 73170 and 178243 from the first group , and 262788 and 193804 from the third group , that were identified with the weak / absent mgh bands in their observed spectra .",
    "the mg abundances derived for these four giants are much lower than that expected ( for details see hema 2014 ) .",
    "the two stars of the first group with strong mg@xmath1 lines and weaker mgh band are 73170 and 178243 .",
    "the mgh subordinate lines to the redward and the blueward of the mg@xmath1 lines are clearly weaker in the observed spectra of 73170 and 178243 , when compared with the spectra of stars with similar stellar parameters .",
    "figure 1 shows the spectra of the first group stars in the order of their increasing @xmath12 from bottom to top .",
    "this comparison clearly shows that the weaker mgh bands in the spectra of these two stars are not as expected for their adopted stellar parameters .",
    "if the weaker mgh band is not due to the star s @xmath12 , log @xmath13 and [ fe / h ] , then the reason would be a lower mg abundance .",
    "these stars are metal rich with strong mg@xmath1 lines in their observed spectra , indicating that the mg abundance in their atmospheres is as expected for their metallicities .",
    "hence , neither the stellar parameters nor the mg abundances are possible reasons for the weaker mgh bands observed in these stars . the only possible reason for the weaker mgh bands would be a lower hydrogen abundance in their atmospheres .    for the derived mg abundance of 73170 , the [ mg / fe ]",
    "is about @xmath20.2 .",
    "this value is about @xmath40.6 dex lower than the average , and about @xmath40.4 dex lower than the minimum [ mg / fe ] , derived for the @xmath0cen giants at the star s metallicity of [ fe / h]=@xmath20.65 , as reported by @xcite . for the derived mg abundance of 178243 , the [ mg / fe ]",
    "is about @xmath20.4 .",
    "this value is about @xmath40.8 dex lower than the average , and about @xmath40.6 dex lower than the minimum [ mg / fe ] derived for the red giants of @xmath0cen at the star s metallicity of [ fe / h]=@xmath20.8 @xcite . nevertheless , going by the observed strengths of the mg@xmath1 lines and the expected mg abundance for the stars metallicity , our derived low mg abundances for these two stars are unacceptable . hence , we emphasize that the weaker mgh bands in these two stars are not due to the stellar parameters and the mg abundances , but most probably due to a relatively lower abundance of hydrogen in their atmospheres",
    ". the typical errors of about @xmath11100k on @xmath12 , determined from the high - resolution spectroscopic studies of red giants , were adopted .",
    "note that , the syntheses of the mgh bands for the upper limit of the @xmath12 for these two stars do not provide a fit to the observed spectrum ( see figure 3 for example ) .",
    "the two third group stars , 262788 and 193804 , have similar stellar parameters , as given by @xcite , and their observed spectra are near identical .",
    "hence , treated as twins .",
    "the observed spectra of these twins were compared with the observed spectra of the first and second group stars of similar stellar parameters ( see figure 2 ) . the first group star , 251701 , with similar stellar parameters as the twins of the third group , shows clear presence of the mgh band in the observed spectrum , but",
    "note the absence of mgh bands in the observed spectra of the twins .",
    "the reason for the absence of the mgh band in the spectra of these twins would be a lower mg abundance in their atmospheres .",
    "however , the mg@xmath1 lines in their observed spectra are strong , as expected for their metallicity and similar in strengths to those of the first group stars .",
    "the mg@xmath1 lines in the spectra of these twins are fairly stronger than in the spectra of the second group stars .",
    "note that , the second group stars are metal poor and have weak or no mg@xmath1 lines ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the strong mg@xmath1 lines in the spectra of 262788 and 193804 , clearly indicate that the mg abundance is normal or as expected for the stars metallicity .",
    "hence , the stellar parameters and the lower mg abundances are ruled out as the possible reasons for the absence of the mgh band in the spectra of these twins .",
    "the only possibility could be a relatively lower abundance of hydrogen in their atmospheres .    for 262788 ,",
    "the derived [ mg / fe]@xmath19@xmath20.6 .",
    "this is about @xmath41.0 dex lower than the average , or about @xmath40.8 dex lower than the minimum [ mg / fe ] value as derived by @xcite , for the star s metallicity , [ fe / h]=@xmath21.0 . for 193804 ,",
    "the derived [ mg / fe]@xmath3@xmath20.1 .",
    "this value is about @xmath40.5 dex lower than the average , or about @xmath40.3 dex lower than the minimum [ mg / fe ] value , as reported by @xcite , for the star s metallicity [ fe / h]=@xmath21.0 .",
    "hence , going by the observed strengths of the mg@xmath1 lines , and the expected mg abundance for the stars metallicity , our derived low mg abundances for these two stars are unacceptable .",
    "this rules out the effects of stellar parameters and the lower mg abundances , as the possible reasons for the absence of the mgh band in the observed spectra of 262788 and 193804 .",
    "the only possible reason for the absence of mgh band could be a relatively lower abundance of hydrogen in their atmospheres .",
    "the spectra synthesized for the upper limit of the @xmath12 for the stars 262788 and 193804 , do not provide a fit to the observed spectra .",
    "the observed weak / absent mgh band in 214247 , of the third group , is as expected for the star s",
    "warmer @xmath12 and metallicity .",
    "the derived mg abundance is as expected for the star s metallicity .",
    "the weak / absent mgh band in the observed spectra of these four giants inspite of the presence of strong mg @xmath1 lines , may not be due to the uncertainty in adopted stellar parameters or a lower mg abundance .",
    "the only plausible reason is a relatively lower abundance of hydrogen in their atmospheres .",
    "hence , we report the discovery of four giants with relatively lower abundance of hydrogen in their atmospheres .",
    "these giants may belong to the group of helium enriched ( @xmath20/@xmath21 @xmath10 0.160.2)/@xmath21 ratio and y for the normal giants are about 0.1 and 0.25 , respectively .",
    "] red giants of @xmath0cen similar to those found in the studies of @xcite , for which the blue main sequence ( bms ) stars may be the progenitors .",
    "the double main sequence , the red main sequence ( rms ) and the blue main sequence ( bms ) , in @xmath0cen was discovered by @xcite .",
    "the bms stars differ from rms stars by their helium enrichment upto y @xmath10 0.38 with the range : 0.35 @xmath3 y @xmath3 0.4 @xcite .",
    "the y value for rms stars is about 0.25 @xcite . from the studies of @xcite , unlike the observed na - o anticorrelation for the metal poor giants of @xmath0cen , the number of giants with na - enrichment increases with the metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "note that 11 stars of our metal rich sample , including the reported 4 h - poor or he - rich stars , show na - enhancement @xcite .",
    "one star , however , is na - normal . for rest of our metal rich sample of 5 stars , na abundances are not available .",
    "however , no obvious trend is seen in al - mg , as the al - mg anticorrelation provides further clue for the he - enrichment in the metal rich giants @xcite .",
    "none of these newly discovered h - deficient giants show the carbon features as seen in the spectra of rcb stars and they do not exhibit rcb ir - colours .",
    "hence , these are not the h - deficient stars of rcb type . to ascertain a range in h - deficiency or the helium enrichment of these newly discovered giants and the analyzed metal rich sample ,",
    "it is essential to study these stars by obtaining their high resolution spectra .",
