    "recent results on 2 + 1 dimensional superconformal chern - simons theories @xcite have shed new light on the @xmath9 correspondence . a long standing problem in establishing this latter",
    "is the identification of the 2 + 1 dimensional superconformal gauge theories dual to @xmath0 supersymmetric backgrounds . in the past , attempts to find duals have focused on yang - mills theories flowing in the ir to superconformal fixed points @xcite .",
    "it seems now that supersymmetric chern - simons theories can do a better job .",
    "the @xmath10 abjm @xcite model nicely incorporates all relevant features of a dual theory for the m theory background @xmath11 , including the maximally supersymmetric @xmath12 case .",
    "interestingly , for large @xmath13 a better supergravity description is provided by the type iia background @xmath14 .",
    "a similar construction has been extended to models with less supersymmetry .",
    "examples of superconformal chern - simons theories with @xmath15 supersymmetry have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the properties of @xmath1 theories have been investigated in @xcite and many models have been constructed and studied in @xcite . for models with @xmath1 supersymmetry the reduction to type iia is still less studied .    in this paper",
    "we consider the particular case of the @xmath1 , m theory solution @xmath2 , its reduction to type iia and its supersymmetric deformations .",
    "in particular we find a family of @xmath1 supersymmetric @xmath0 vacua in massive type iia supergravity with @xmath4 isometry , which include the @xmath2 reduction as special case .",
    "the interest in such solutions is two - fold .",
    "on one side , they provide non - trivial examples of @xmath0 supersymmetric vacua of massive type iia . in spite of the many known @xmath0 vacua ,",
    "the picture we have so far is not exhaustive . in particular , most of the solutions have @xmath16 structure @xcite , which is the simplest case but not the generic one . only very recently",
    ", the conditions for @xmath17 supersymmetric solutions with generic @xmath18 structure have been explicitly written and a type iia solution was given @xcite . as we will see later , in order to have non zero roman mass and a running dilaton , type iia backgrounds must have @xmath18 structure . in that respect ,",
    "our solution is one of the first non - trivial examples of @xmath0 backgrounds with @xmath18 structure .    on the other side ,",
    "the solution is also relevant for the @xmath19 correspondence .",
    "as noticed in @xcite , the roman mass can be interpreted as the overall chern - simons coupling in the dual gauge theory .",
    "more generally , all the integer chern - simons couplings and the ranks of the gauge groups should appear in the dual supergravity description .",
    "the authors of @xcite analysed the abjm and abj models , finding solutions with @xmath20 and @xmath17 supersymmetry which are deformations of @xmath14 and have a field theoretical interpretation .",
    "they also find analogous solutions with @xmath1 and @xmath21 supersymmetry at first order in perturbation theory @xcite , the entire solution still remaining to be found . the same argument applies to all @xmath1 chern - simons quivers .",
    "in particular it should always exist a massive type iia deformation of the original supergravity solution which corresponds to a quiver with arbitrary chern - simons couplings and ranks .",
    "the deformation should preserve the same @xmath1 supersymmetry and the same global symmetry as the original theory .",
    "the solution we find in this paper corresponds to the supergravity backgrounds @xmath22 .",
    "a candidate dual chern - simons quiver has been proposed in @xcite and further studied in @xcite .",
    "it is based on a superpotential with manifest @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "the existence of a supergravity solution with the same symmetry can be seen as a partial check of the correctness of the proposal .",
    "we chose @xmath23 because of its large global symmetry deformation of abjm , where the full solution is still lacking . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the type iia reduction of @xmath23 enjoys the largest global symmetry among the @xmath1 models with known or proposed chern - simons duals . ] . the isometries will allow to reduce the supersymmetry conditions to a set of ordinary first order equations .",
    "fortunately these equations are not over - constrained and reduce to a pair of equations for two unknowns , which can be used to show the existence of a regular deformation .",

    "these models possess the same @xmath16 symmetry and simply correspond to different choices of chern - simons couplings in the dual quiver .",
    "we shall discuss the relation of our results to @xmath24 in the following . ] .",
    "the methods of @xcite and this paper still apply .",
    "however the smaller symmetry makes it more difficult to find explicit solutions to all orders .",
    "for example , in the case of another famous coset manifold @xmath25 , studied in the chern - simons context in @xcite , the global symmetry @xmath26 is reduced to a single @xmath27 .",
    "generic sasaki - einstein manifolds are even more problematic having only abelian isometries .",

    "a candidate dual three - dimensional yang - mills theory was proposed .",
    "there are various indications now - days that a better candidate for the dual field theory is a chern - simons theory .",
    "an @xmath1 chern - simons theory with the right moduli space was identified in @xcite and further studied in @xcite .",

    "note that this theory has the same field content and superpotential as the quiver associated to d3-branes sitting at a @xmath49 singularity and describing a @xmath50 @xmath17 superconformal theory .    with the choice of chern - simons couplings @xmath51 , the moduli space of the theory is the calabi - yau cone @xmath52 , and the theory describes the m theory background @xmath53 .",
    "it is interesting to see in details how this happens @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the d - term equations in a @xmath1 chern - simons theory are modified by a term proportional to the chern - simons coupling d_a = k_a [ dtermi ] . in this formula , @xmath54 is the momentum map for the action of the @xmath55-th @xmath33 gauge field on the elementary fields , and @xmath56 is an auxiliary field in the gauge multiplets .",
    "more explicitly , the previous equations read _",
    "i=1 ^ 3 |u_i|^2 - |v_i|^2 = k_1 , + _ i=1 ^ 3 |v_i|^2 - |w_i|^2 = k_2 , + _ i=1 ^ 3 |w_i|^2 - |u_i|^2 = k_3 .",

    "the sum of the three equations in ( [ dtermii ] ) is zero , reflecting the fact that the overall @xmath33 acts trivially on the fields .",
    "the difference of the first two equations in ( [ dtermii ] ) imposes the vanishing of the momentum map for @xmath57 .",
    "the last equation just determines the value of @xmath56 .",
    "we see that effectively we should only divide by the ( complexified ) gauge group @xmath57 which acts with charge @xmath58 on @xmath59 and charge @xmath60 on @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 is broken to @xmath64 by the chern - simons interactions and remains as a global symmetry .",

    "the gauge invariant chiral operators are given by o_n=(u r r)^n , where the @xmath16 and @xmath27 indices are symmetrized due to the f - term conditions .",
    "since the superpotential @xmath69 must have r - charge two , @xmath70 has r - charge @xmath71 . in conclusion",

    "we recognize the kk spectrum of m theory compactified on @xmath23 @xcite . a more geometrical proof , based on toric geometry , that the moduli space of the chern - simons theory is @xmath73 can be found in @xcite .",

    "it is easy to identify the action of @xmath64 with a shift of @xmath79 in the metric ( [ metricam111 ] ) .",
    "reducing along @xmath79 gives a supersymmetric type iia background with non trivial dilaton , @xmath80 flux and @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "the metric is [ metric10 ] d s_10 ^ 2 = e^2 a ds^2_ads_4 + ds^2_6 , where the six - dimensional compact manifold is a 2-dimensional fibration over @xmath81 [ metric6 ] d s^2_6 = e^2 a [ ds^2_^2 + d ^2 + ( d+ ) ^2 ] .",

    "type iia reductions of @xmath23 and other sasaki - einstein manifolds have been considered in the past @xcite .",

    "the existence of a solution is predicted by the chern - simons theory since a modification of @xmath85 and @xmath84 does not affect the superpotential and preserves the @xmath16 symmetry .",
