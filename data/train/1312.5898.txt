    "smb@xmath0 has been studied for decades as a typical mixed - valence system  @xcite and also as a kondo insulator.@xcite research on smb@xmath0 has been revived owing to the recent suggestion of it to be a topological kondo insulator .",
    "@xcite then various follow - up experiments were actively carried out to verify this issue.@xcite the topological insulator can be identified by the existence of the in - gap states with a dirac - cone dispersion , and so several angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments were reported to probe the in - gap states.@xcite however , smb@xmath0 has a very narrow band gap and a large effective mass due to the hybridization between the localized @xmath6-electron and conduction electrons , which makes it difficult to observe the clear in - gap states near the fermi level ( @xmath7 ) within the limit of the current experimental resolution .",
    "topological insulators are classified by four @xmath8 topological indices @xmath9 , which distinguish between strong ( @xmath10 ) and weak ( @xmath11 ) topological insulators and give information on the surface topology protected by the time reversal symmetry.@xcite the number of dirac points is odd on any surface of a strong topological insulator , while it is even or zero for a weak topological insulator .",
    "if the system has the inversion symmetry , four @xmath8 topological indices can be easily obtained from the products of parity eigenvalues.@xcite hence , the information on the surface topology can be inferred from the bulk band parity eigenvalues at the high symmetry @xmath5-points .",

    "interestingly , we have found a semi - core band having the mixed parity , which affects the parity eigenvalues of the special @xmath5-points in the bulk brillouin zone considerably .",
