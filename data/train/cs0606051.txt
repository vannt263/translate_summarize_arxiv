    "therefore , we have @xmath260 by adding the above inequalities and using the pairwise disjoint properties , where a necessary condition of @xmath261 is that @xmath262 , that is , @xmath249 for any row @xmath248 of @xmath7 whose @xmath6-th component is 1 .",
    "this implies that @xmath23 satisfies all the parity - check equations corresponding to the rows @xmath248 of @xmath7 whose @xmath6-th component is 1 .",

    "thus , @xmath292 , and every row of @xmath287 has exactly two @xmath145 s , which implies @xmath293 .",
    "hence , the weights of rows of @xmath283 are either @xmath294 or @xmath295 , which implies that @xmath23 satisfies every parity - check equation in @xmath7 and thus is a codeword .",
