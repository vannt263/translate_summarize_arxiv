    "it has been a long - standing problem in geometric analysis to find a good notion of a ricci flow with singularities .",
    "the motivation comes from the fact that a ricci flow with a smooth initial condition can develop singularities without blowing up everywhere ; hence one would like to continue the flow beyond the singular time .",
    "the presence of singularities in ricci flow is one instance of the widespread phenomenon of singularities in pde , which is often handled by developing appropriate notions of generalized solutions .",
    "for example , in the case of the minimal surface equation , one has minimizing or stationary integral currents @xcite , while in the case of mean curvature flow one has brakke flows @xcite and level set flows @xcite .",
    "generalized solutions provide a framework for studying issues such as existence , uniqueness and partial regularity .    one highly successful way to deal with ricci flow singularities was by surgery , as developed by hamilton @xcite and perelman @xcite .",
    "surgery served as a way to suppress singularities and avoid related analytical issues , thereby making it possible to apply ricci flow to geometric and topological problems .",

''    in this paper we address the problem of flowing through singularities in the three - dimensional case by introducing singular ricci flows , which are ricci flow spacetimes subject to certain conditions .",
    "we show that singular ricci flows have a number of good properties , by establishing existence and compactness results , as well as a number of structural results .",
    "we also use singular ricci flows to partially answer perelman s question , by showing that ricci flow with surgery ( for a fixed initial condition ) subconverges to a singular ricci flow as the surgery parameter goes to zero . these results and further results in the sequel",
    "strongly indicate that singular ricci flows provide a natural analytical framework for three - dimensional ricci flows with singularities .",
    "although it is rather different in spirit , we mention that there is earlier work in the literature on ricci flow through singularities ; see the end of the introduction for further discussion .      before formulating our first result ,",
    "we briefly recall perelman s version of ricci flow with surgery ( which followed earlier work of hamilton ) ; see appendix [ rfsurgery ] for more information .",
    "ricci flow with surgery evolves a riemannian @xmath0-manifold by alternating between two processes : flowing by ordinary ricci flow until the metric goes singular , and modifying the resulting limit by surgery , so as to produce a compact smooth riemannian manifold that serves as a new initial condition for ricci flow .",
    "the construction is regulated by a global parameter @xmath1 as well as decreasing parameter functions @xmath2 , which have the following significance :    * the scale at which surgery occurs is bounded above in terms of @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , surgery at time @xmath4 is performed by cutting along necks whose scale tends to zero as @xmath5 goes to zero .",
    "note that @xmath6 has other roles in addition to this . *",
    "the function @xmath7 defines the canonical neighborhood scale : at time @xmath4 , near any point with scalar curvature at least @xmath8 , the flow is ( modulo parabolic rescaling ) approximated to within error @xmath9 by either a @xmath10-solution ( see appendix [ appkappa ] ) or a standard postsurgery model solution .    in ricci",
    "flow with surgery , the initial conditions are assumed to be _",
    "normalized _ , meaning that at each point @xmath11 in the initial time slice , the eigenvalues of the curvature operator @xmath12 are bounded by one in absolute value , and the volume of the unit ball @xmath13 is at least half the volume of the euclidean unit ball . by rescaling , any compact riemannian manifold can be normalized .",
    "perelman showed that under certain constraints on the parameters , one can implement ricci flow with surgery for any normalized initial condition .",
    "his constraints allow one to make @xmath6 as small as one wants .",
    "hence one can consider the behavior of ricci flow with surgery , for a fixed initial condition , as @xmath6 goes to zero .    in order to formulate our convergence theorem , we will use a spacetime framework . unlike the case of general relativity , where one has a lorentzian manifold , in our setting",
    "there is a natural foliation of spacetime by time slices , which carry riemannian metrics .",
    "this is formalized in the following definition .",

    "unless otherwise specified , when we refer to geometric quantities such as curvature , we will implicitly be referring to the metric on the time slices .",
    "note that near any point @xmath30 , a ricci flow spacetime @xmath14 reduces to a ricci flow in the usual sense , because the time function @xmath16 will form part of a chart @xmath31 near @xmath11 for which the coordinate vector field @xmath32 coincides with @xmath21 ; then one has @xmath33 .",

    "all of these results require uniform bounds on curvature in regions of a given size around a basepoint , which we do not have . instead",
    ", our approach is based on the fact that in a three dimensional ricci flow with surgery , the scalar curvature controls the local geometry .",
    "we first prove a general pointed compactness result for sequences of ( possibly incomplete ) riemannian manifolds whose local geometry is governed by a control function .",
    "we then apply this general compactness result in the case when the riemannian manifolds are the spacetimes of ricci flows with surgery , and the control functions are constructed from the scalar curvature functions . to obtain ( 1)-(3 ) of theorem [ thm_main_convergence ] we have to rule out the possibility that part of the spacetime with controlled time and scalar curvature escapes to infinity",

    "this is done by means of a new estimate on the spacetime geometry of a ricci flow with surgery ; see proposition [ curve ] below .    motivated by the conclusion of theorem [ thm_main_convergence ]",

    "3 .   for a global parameter @xmath1 and decreasing functions @xmath67 ,",
    "the spacetime @xmath15 is @xmath10-noncollapsed below scale @xmath63 in the sense of appendix [ kappa ] and satisfies the @xmath7-canonical neighborhood assumption in the sense of appendix [ canon ] .",

    "thus ( b ) and ( c ) can be viewed as asymptotic conditions at infinity for a ricci flow defined on a noncompact spacetime .    with this definition , perelman s existence theorem for ricci flow with surgery and theorem [ thm_main_convergence ]",
    "immediately imply :    [ cor_existence_smooth_initial_condition ] if @xmath70 is a compact normalized riemannian @xmath0-manifold then there exists a singular ricci flow having initial condition @xmath70 , with parameter functions @xmath10 and @xmath7 as in theorem [ thm_main_convergence ] .    from the pde viewpoint ,",
    "flow with surgery is a regularization of ricci flow , while singular ricci flows may be considered to be generalized solutions to ricci flow . in this language ,",
    "corollary [ cor_existence_smooth_initial_condition ] gives the existence of generalized solutions by means of a regularization procedure .",
    "one can compare this with the existence proof for brakke flows in @xcite or level set flows in @xcite .",
    "the existence assertion in corollary [ cor_existence_smooth_initial_condition ] leads to the corresponding uniqueness question :    if two singular ricci flows have isometric initial conditions , are the underlying ricci flow spacetimes the same up to diffeomorphism",
    "?    an affirmative answer would confirm perelman s expectation that ricci flow with surgery should converge to a canonical flow through singularities , as it would imply that if one takes a fixed initial condition in theorem [ thm_main_convergence ] then one would have convergence without having to pass to a subsequence .",
    "having such a uniqueness result , in conjunction with theorem [ thm_main_convergence ] , would closely parallel the results of @xcite that @xmath71-convex mean curvature flow with surgery converges to level set flow when the surgery parameters tend to zero .",
    "the asymptotic conditions in the definition of a singular ricci flow have a number of implications which we analyze in this paper .",
    "in addition to clarifying the structure of limits of ricci flows with surgery as in theorem [ thm_main_convergence ] , the results indicate that singular ricci flows are well behaved objects from geometric and analytical points of view .    to analyze the geometry of ricci flow spacetimes , we use two different riemannian metrics .",
    "[ spacetimemetric ]",
    "let @xmath14 be a ricci flow spacetime .",
    "the _ spacetime metric _ on @xmath15 is the riemannian metric @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the extension of @xmath23 to a quadratic form on @xmath74 such that @xmath75 .",
    "the _ quasiparabolic metric _ on @xmath15 is the riemannian metric @xmath76 .    for the remainder of the introduction ,",
    "unless otherwise specified , @xmath14 will denote a fixed singular ricci flow .",
    "conditions ( b ) and ( c ) of definition [ def_singular_ricci_flow ] imply that the scalar curvature controls the local geometry of the singular ricci flow .",
    "this has several implications .",
    "* ( high - curvature regions in singular ricci flows are topologically standard ) for every @xmath4 , the superlevel set @xmath77 is contained in a disjoint union of connected components whose diffeomorphism types come from a small list of possibilities , with well - controlled local geometry .",
    "in particular , each connected component @xmath78 of @xmath79 has finitely many ends , and passing to the metric completion @xmath80 adds at most one point for each end ( proposition [ prop_large_r_structure ] ) . * ( bounded geometry ) the spacetime metric @xmath81 has bounded geometry at the scale defined by the scalar curvature , while the quasiparabolic metric @xmath82 is complete and has bounded geometry in the usual sense  the injectivity radius is bounded below and all derivatives of curvature are uniformly bounded ( lemma [ quasip ] ) .",
    "the local control on geometry also leads to a compactness property for singular ricci flows :    * ( compactness ) if one has a sequence @xmath83 of singular ricci flows with a fixed choice of functions in definition [ def_singular_ricci_flow ] , and the initial metrics @xmath84 form a precompact set in the smooth topology , then a subsequence converges in the sense of theorem [ thm_main_convergence ] ( proposition [ rfcompactness ] ) .",
    "the proof of the compactness result is similar to the proof of theorem [ thm_main_convergence ] .",
    "we also have global results concerning the scalar curvature and volume .    *",
    "( scalar curvature and volume control ) for any @xmath85 , the scalar curvature is integrable on @xmath86 .",

    "( proposition [ prop_r_in_lp ] )    the starting point for the proof of the above results concerning volume is the fact that for ricci flow , the time derivative of the volume form is given by the negative of the scalar curvature .",
    "to obtain global results , one is effectively forced to do integration by parts using the time vector field @xmath21 .",
    "however , there is a substantial complication due to the potential incompleteness of the time vector field ; we overcome this by using theorem [ thm_finiteness_of_bad_worldlines ] below , together with the gradient estimate on scalar curvature .",
    "to describe the next results , we introduce the following definitions .",

    "if @xmath94 is a worldline then we may have @xmath97 . in this case , the scalar curvature blows up along @xmath98 as @xmath99 , and the worldline encounters a singularity .",
    "an example would be a shrinking round space form , or a neckpinch . a worldline may also encounter a singularity going backward in time .",
    "a worldline @xmath94 is _ bad _ if @xmath100 , i.e. if it is not defined at @xmath101 .    among our structural results ,",
    "perhaps the most striking is the following :    [ thm_finiteness_of_bad_worldlines ] suppose that @xmath14 is a singular ricci flow and @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath78 is a connected component of @xmath79 then only finitely many points in @xmath78 have bad worldlines .    as an illustration of the theorem ,",

    "the theorem asserts that only finitely many ( in this case two ) worldlines emerge from the singularity .",
