    "it is known that fusion reactions within a plasma are enhanced .",
    "this is due to the fact that ions in a plasma are not `` naked '' , but are surrounded by electrons in the plasma that form a shielding cloud around them .",
    "thus , an ion is not repelled , as is a `` naked '' ion , since the `` dressing '' of electrons shield the repulsive potential of the ion for distances greater than the debye radius , @xmath4 .",
    "the presence of the plasma is taken into account , in what is called the _",
    "screening factor_@xcite , in estimating cross sections of nuclear reaction rates . in the static case ,",
    "when the velocities of the ions are assumed to be very slow compared to those of the screening particles , the screening factor used is the salpeter factor @xcite ( valid in the weak screening limit , when @xmath5 electromagnetic fluctuations are present in a plasma , even when in thermal equilibrium . from these fluctuations ,",
    "we evaluate the screening of the interacting particles .",
    "their effect is to enhance the reaction rates , just as a negative potential reduces the coulomb repulsion .",
    "we use the formalism of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem@xcite to describe the electromagnetic fluctuating fields . using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ,",
    "it is possible to study all the fluctuations existent in a plasma .",
    "that is , it is possible to also include the effect of screening modes that are not eigenmodes ( i.e. , not at the plasma frequency ) .",
    "these modes are highly damped , but although they have a small amplitudes , their overall effect turns out to be great because their phase space is very large . in particular",
    ", they have non - negligible amplitudes for @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the plasma frequency . in estimating the effect of electromagnetic fluctuations on the screening in the limit where only frequencies on the order of @xmath7 are important ( @xmath8 ( @xmath9 the usual salpeter factor is obtained .    in a non - magnetized plasma ,",
    "the longitudinal eigenmodes are langmuir waves with @xmath10 for usual laboratory and space plasmas , this frequency is much less than @xmath11 and the assumption that @xmath12 is reasonable .",
    "however , if we are interested in the effect of all the existent modes in the plasma on the screening , it is important not to be limited only to modes where @xmath13    we show , in section ii , that the screening can be described in terms of the electromagnetic fluctuations . the change in the reaction rates due to the screening is calculated and our screening factor is compared with the salpeter factor .",
    "a discussion of our results is given in section iii .",
    "the expression for the reaction rate between ions 1 and 2 is @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the cross section and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the thermal distributions of the particles .",
    "the cross section is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 @xmath20 is the penetration factor , @xmath21 is the kinetic energy of the ions at large separations in the center of mass reference frame and @xmath22 is a purely nuclear factor that varies slowly with @xmath21 .",

    ", @xmath31 is pratically independent of @xmath32 in the integration interval .",
    "the reaction rate @xmath33 is then found to be increased by a factor @xmath34 @xcite . in the static case , the weak screening limit , the enhancement factor is @xmath35 , the salpeter factor .    in a plasma ,",
    "electromagnetic fluctuations are always present , acting as a background for the interacting ions .",
    "let us consider the effect of the fluctuating electric fields .",
    "@xmath36 , the electric potential acting in the region from @xmath27 to @xmath26 , creates a potential energy @xmath37 .",
    "the enhancement factor is , then , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the potential energy of the ions when they are at infinity , @xmath40 . averaging @xmath41 in time and using a taylor expansion ,",
    "we obtain terms which are proportional to @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , as well as cross terms . because the fields @xmath36 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are random with respect to one another , the only terms that remain to first order are @xmath42 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . assuming that they are equal to one another , @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath36 is assumed to be changing slowly in the integrand of the penetration factor in the region from @xmath27 to @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , we consider fields with frequencies @xmath51 and wavenumbers @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the velocity of the reduced mass in the center of mass system .",
    "we find that @xmath42 is relatively insenstive to the exact upper limits of the integrations , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath42 is related to the fluctuations of the longitudinal electric field in a plasma : @xmath56 . therefore , @xmath57 > from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem@xcite , the expression for the intensity of the fluctuations of the longitudinal electric field is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the longitudinal dielectric permittivity of the plasma .",

    "( 4 ) , to obtain the fluctuations in the longitudinal field due to the eigenmodes ( i.e. , the electrostatic langmuir waves ) , as well as to all the other fluctuations existent in the plasma .",
    "we show below that the overall effect of fluctuations with @xmath60 is to substantially increase the reaction rates .",
    "although the amplitudes of these fluctuations are small , they are not negligible . due to the very large range of their frequencies ,",
    "their overall effect is to increase the reaction rates appreciably . because the reaction rates are exponentially dependent on the screening potential , its increase is appreciable for reactions with large values of @xmath61 such as @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in the limit where only fluctuations with frequencies on the order of the eigenfrequency @xmath64 are important , eq .",
    "( 4 ) can be easily intergrated over frequency with the aid of the kramers - kronig relations , obtaining @xmath65 this is the expression which is generally found in text books @xcite . for an electron plasma in the collisionless case , the longitudinal dielectric permittivity is @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 . with this dielectric permittivity , @xmath69 [ eq.(3 ) ] and the enhancement factor f , in eq.(2 ) , is the salpeter enhancement factor ,",
    "@xmath70    we use the model described in detail in opher & opher @xcite , which includes thermal and collisional effects , to obtain the longitudinal dielectric permittivity .",
    "it uses the vlasov equation in first order with the bgk ( bhatnagar - gross - krook ) collision term , which is a model equation of the boltzmann collision term @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of collisions changes the results very little and the effect on @xmath71 for the plasmas studied , is almost negligible . for example , in the case analysed in opher and opher @xcite , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the difference in the correlation energy , with or without collisions , is less than @xmath74 .",
    "the dielectric permittivity that we therefore use , is almost identical to the collisionless dielectric permittivity given after eq .",

    "( 2 ) for the transverse field @xmath80 in conjunction with the transverse dielectric permittivity instead of eq . ( 7 ) , the correct black body spectrum is obtained [ 5,6 ] .",
    "we estimate the enhancement factor @xmath81 for the reaction rates @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath63 for an electron - proton plasma at temperatures @xmath84 and densities ranging from @xmath85 choosing the maximum density for each temperature so that the plasma parameter is less than @xmath86 .",
    "when @xmath87 approaches such high values , non - linear effects begin to be important .",
    "( note that @xmath88 has an extra factor @xmath89 due to the inclusion of protons . )",
    "the gamow energy , the most effective energy for thermonuclear reactions , is @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the reduced atomic weight and @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , for each of the temperatures that we choose , the gamow energy changes , with a consequent change in the limits of the integration , @xmath55 and @xmath54 . as a particular case , we assume the center of mass energy to be zero .",
    "@xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the salpeter enhancement factor and @xmath87 is the plasma parameter , is plotted for @xmath95 in fig .",
    "1 . in fig .",
    "2 , we plot @xmath96 vs @xmath87 for @xmath97 we also estimate the enhancement factor @xmath41 for the reaction @xmath98 in an electron - deuteron plasma for temperatures @xmath84 and densities @xmath99 again , the maximum density for each temperature is chosen to be @xmath100 . @xmath96 vs @xmath87 is shown in fig .",
    "we see that the enhancement factor @xmath41 is larger than the salpeter factor .    in order to see how the fluctuating potential is affected by these modes , we plot the potential @xmath101 vs @xmath102 for the reaction @xmath63 , with @xmath95 and @xmath103 ( in this case , @xmath104 ) in fig .",
    "the solid curve is plotted for @xmath105 , the dashed curve for @xmath106 and the dotted curve for @xmath107 .",
    "we normalize the curves and plot @xmath108 divided by @xmath109 . when @xmath108 is integrated for all wavenumbers @xmath110 , but only for frequencies up to @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , we obtain the salpeter potential .",
    "we see that for @xmath107 , the potential @xmath113 has non - negligible values only at low frequencies .",
    "however , for @xmath106 and @xmath105 , the potential @xmath114 spreads out to high frequencies . for these high values of @xmath115 instead of dropping abruptly at @xmath116",
    "the curves decrease slowly with frequency .",
    "there is thus a substantial contribution for @xmath60 .",
    "thus for large wavenumbers , ( i.e. , @xmath117 ) fluctuations make a substantial contribution at frequencies higher than the plasma frequency . for example , for @xmath118 and @xmath119 @xmath120 is not zero , but 0.002 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath121 and @xmath122 @xmath123 is 0.01 .",
    "by using the _ fluctuation - dissipation theorem _ to estimate the screening of the reacting ions due to the electromagnetic field fluctuations in plasma , we calculate the enhancement factor for the reaction rates .",
    "the enhancement is found to be greater than that for the adiabatic case ( @xmath12 ) , where the salpeter factor is valid .",
    "it is important to note that this effect is not due to a specific choice of the dielectric permittivity .",
    "the model that we use includes the standard dielectric permitivity and gives almost the same results as does a collisionless thermal description .",
    "a higher enhancement factor is obtained because we include the high frequencies and do not assume that @xmath124 . using this method in a previous study to derive the transverse magnetic fluctuations , the standard black body spectrum was obtained . for the plasmas studied here , electron - proton plasmas with temperatures @xmath125 and densities 1@xmath126 the reaction rates for @xmath82 , @xmath127 and @xmath63 are increased up to @xmath128 in the regime @xmath129 .",
    "the reaction @xmath98 for an electron - deuteron plasma is increased by @xmath130 .",
    "we find that these fluctuations have small , but not negligible amplitudes , compared to those at low frequencies .",
    "they exist , however , in a much larger range of phase space , up to very high frequencies .",
    "their overall effect is to increase the screening potential . because the reaction rates are exponentially dependent on the screening potential , this increase is especially strong for reactions with relatively large @xmath61 , such as @xmath62 and @xmath63 . when summing the fluctuations only up to the plasma eigenfrequency @xmath116 the salpeter enhancement factor is obtained .",
    "we show here that the fluctuating potential has a large contribution from highly damped modes with frequencies @xmath131 .",
    "there has been some controversy about the existence of a screening factor , which is different from the salpeter factor , due to dynamic screening @xcite .",
    "the effect described here is due to quasi - fluctuations that are heavily damped and that always exist in a plasma .",
    "they alter the salpeter screening factor , although not necessarily in the same way as does dynamic screening .",
    "this work shows that by taking into account all the modes , including those which are heavily damped , with frequencies higher than the plasma frequency , the screening factor of the nuclear reaction rates is altered and is larger than the salpeter factor .",
