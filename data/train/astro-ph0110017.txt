    "the synthetic continuum spectra of the brown dwarf gliese 229b has been obtained by several authors .",
    "marley et al . ( 1996 ) , griffith , yelle & marley ( 1998 ) , saumon et al ( 2000 ) , obtained an overall good fit of the observed spectra of gliese 229b over a wide range of wavelengths and attributed the very rapid decline of the observed continuum flux in the optical region to the dust particulates in its atmosphere . on the other hand , tinney et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; tsuji , ohnaka , & aoki ( 1999 ) , burrows , marley , & sharp ( 2000 ) argued that the pressure broadened red wing of the 0.77 @xmath0 k i doublet and the 0.5891 , 0.5897 @xmath0 na i d could account for the observed features of the continuum flux shortward of 1.1 @xmath0 ( for a recent review , see burrows , hubbard , lunine & liebert 2001 ) .",
    "the first optical spectrum of a t dwarf sdss 1624 + 0029 favors the latter explanation(liebert et al .",
    "2000 ) and at present there is enough evidence that dust particulates can not exist in the visible atmospheres of comparatively cool t dwarf such as gl 229b",
    ". however , dust can be present at the visible height of the atmosphere of warmer brown dwarfs and l dwarfs with effective temperature greater than 1300 k.    very recently , allard et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have presented a detail theoretical investigation on the effects of dust in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs by considering two limiting cases : ( a ) inefficient gravitational settling of the dust grains and ( b ) efficient gravitational settling . in the former case the dust",
    "is distributed according to the chemical equilibrium predictions and provides the maximum impact upon the atmosphere while in the latter case the dust forms and depletes refractory elements from the gas yielding a minimal effect on the brown dwarf atmosphere .",
    "when the effective temperature of the object is bellow 1300 k complete gravitational settling of dust grains should occur whereas gravitational settling can not occur when the effective temperature is above 1800 k. in the intermediate case ( @xmath1 k ) an optically thick dust cloud forms in the visible atmosphere ( marley and ackerman 2001 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we show that significant polarization can arise due to dust scattering in the atmosphere of relatively warmer brown dwarfs where dust grains have not been settled completely . in the presence of dust particulates of small size , the continuum flux in the near optical region could be polarized significantly while non - zero polarization can occur in the infra - red if the particle size is large .",
    "hence observation of polarized radiation from brown dwarfs could be a potential probe for the properties of dust grains .",
    "polarization of radiation due to scattering in stellar atmospheres or envelopes has been considered by many authors . numerous polarimetric data and their interpretation have been presented by gehrels ( 1974 ) . since noticeable deviation from sphericity",
    "are to be expected from rapidly rotating stars , much attention has been paid to calculations of intrinsic polarization of be stars .",
    "degree of polarization varying from 0.1 % in the visible region to 2% in the far infra - red has been observed in be stars by rucinski ( 1970 ) , collins ( 1970 ) , harrington and collins ( 1968 ) , haisch and cassinelli ( 1978 ) .",
    "extensive observational data for polarization from cool stars are given by serkowskii ( 1967 , 1968 ) .",
    "it has been established by many observations that the intrinsic polarization of radiation is a common behavior for most young stars ( see for example menard & bastien 1992 , yudin & evans 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "observation of non - zero polarization from unresolved objects indicates non - sphericity of the stars .",
    "the non - sphericity of an object , which leads to incomplete cancellation of the polarization of radiation from different areas of the surface , may result from several causes .",
    "the rotation of a stellar object imparts to it the shape of an oblate ellipsoid .",
    "this is evident in the outer solar planets as well .",
    "the eccentricities of jupiter , saturn and uranus are 0.35 , 0.43 , 0.21 respectively at 1 bar pressure level .",
    "tidal interaction with the companion in a binary system imposes an ellipsoidal shape extended towards the companion .",
    "spectroscopic studies by basri ( 1999 ) indicate rapid rotation of brown dwarfs along their axis .",
    "a general trend to higher velocities as one looks to objects of lower luminosity is found in this study .",
    "the brown dwarf kelu 1 is found to be the fastest rotator having the projected angular velocity @xmath2 as high as 80 km / s corresponding to an angular velocity of @xmath3 .",
    "the surface gravity of brown dwarf varies from @xmath4 to @xmath5 implying a mass range from 36 @xmath6 to 73 @xmath6 ( marley et al 1996 ) . as a consequence",
    ", a fast rotating brown dwarf will have significant departure from sphericity .",
    "the maximum possible oblateness of a stable rotating fluid body having polytropic equation of state with different indices has been derived by chandrasekhar ( 1933 ) .",
    "the relation between the eccentricity @xmath7 and the rotational velocity @xmath8 for a rigidly rotating body ( maclaurine spheroid ) with uniform density is given by :    @xmath9^{1/2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 is the density of the fluid . here",
    "the eccentricity is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the polar and the equatorial radius respectively .",
    "the eccentricity ` e ' and the oblateness ` q ' are related by the expression @xmath14 .    adopting the empirical relationship given in marley et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for mass and radius of brown dwarf , the mean density of a brown dwarf with @xmath15 and @xmath16 would be @xmath17 .",
    "for @xmath18 , the above formula yields @xmath19 .",
    "however , in reality the density is not uniform and the above formula yields slightly higher value of e compared to the same for non - uniform density distribution as can be verified by applying to the case of jupiter , saturn and uranus .",
    "nevertheless , the rapid rotation of brown dwarfs would certainly impose deviation from sphericity in its shape and hence the disc integrated polarization will not be cancelled out .",
    "the dependence of polarization due to single scattering by grains on the oblateness of an object has been discussed by dolginov , gnedin & silantev ( 1995 ) and by simmons ( 1982 ) . following simmons ( 1982 ) , the analytical expression ( first order approximation ) for the degree of polarization due to single scattering from a spheroid with uniform density can be written as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 depends on the scattering phase function , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the outer and the inner equatorial axis lengths , @xmath24 is the particle number density , @xmath25 is the associated legendre polynomial of order 2 and @xmath26 is the wavelength .",
    "the expression for @xmath27 depends on the density distribution and hence on the eccentricity of the spheroid .",
    "the values of @xmath21 for different values of @xmath28 , @xmath29 being the radius of the scattering particle , as well as the expression for @xmath27 are given in simmons ( 1982 ) .",
    "the first order approximation is valid when @xmath30 .",
    "we have calculated the degree of polarization as a function of eccentricity @xmath7 by considering mie scattering .",
    "figure  1 presents the degree of polarization as a function of eccentricity viewed edge on i.e. , when @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "figure  1 shows that the qualitative feature of polarization does not change with the change in the eccentricity .",
    "this is found by simmons ( 1982 ) as well .",
    "polarization increases with the increase in the eccentricity . for @xmath33",
    "the change in the degree of polarization is small .",
    "for all the values of @xmath34 the variation in polarization is not too high when @xmath7 varies from 0.2 to 0.4 . in our calculation",
    "we have taken @xmath35 .",
    "the choice is arbitrary as the main purpose of figure  1 is to show the effect of eccentricity on the degree of polarization . in the realistic case",
    ", the density must be non - uniform and the polarization would occur due to multiple scattering . therefore one has to solve the equations for the transfer of polarized radiation with the incorporation of mie theory of scattering .",
    "the stokes parameters representing a linearly polarized beam are given by @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent two mutually orthogonal states of linear polarization .",
    "the degree of polarization is given by @xmath40 .",
    "for a plane parallel atmosphere the equation of transfer can be written as ( chandrasekhar 1960 ) : @xmath41 where @xmath42 @xmath43 is the cosine of the angle made by the ray to the normal , @xmath44 is the optical depth , @xmath45 is the albedo for single scattering and @xmath46 is the azimuth - independent phase matrix .",
    "the values of the effective temperature @xmath47 and the surface gravity @xmath48 of brown dwarf are constrained by the bolometric luminosity and the evolutionary sequence of the object ( saumon et al 1996 ) . in the present letter , we have adopted a model atmosphere with @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51=-0.3 $ ] ( k band ) .",
    "the temperature - pressure profile for model with @xmath50 and @xmath52 has kindly been provided by m. marley ( private communication ) and the opacity data by d. saumon .",
    "using an iterative process for temperature correction we have obtained the temperature profile for @xmath16 . in this process",
    "we have used the temperature profile for @xmath53 as the initial temperature profile .",
    "we have ignored any change in the density profile with the increase in the temperature .",
    "we have incorporated the dust opacity by using the mie theory of scattering . following griffith , yelle and marley ( 1998 ) , and marley & ackerman ( 2001 )",
    "we have considered a lognormal spherical particle size distribution .",
    "the mean radius of the silicate grain ( real part of the refractive index 1.65 ) has been considered as @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "although it is difficult to infer the grain sizes by direct observation , atmospheres of the outer solar planets indicate that the mean radius of the grains is expected to be as high as @xmath56 to @xmath57 marley & ackerman 2001 ) .",
    "however in the present investigation we have considered smaller particles as the effect of particle size on the degree of polarization can well be visualized without going for larger particle size .",
    "we solve the transfer equations for the polarized radiation by using discretization method .",
    "the numerical procedure is described in detail by sengupta ( 1993 ) .    in the absence of a magnetic field",
    ", a radiation field could be polarized only by scattering .",
    "the extent of scattering is determined by the albedo @xmath45 and the angular distribution of the scattered photon is governed by the phase function .",
    "the albedo for single scattering is defined as @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the cross - section for the rayleigh and the mie scattering respectively and @xmath61 is the total extinction co - efficient . while the rayleigh phase function is symmetric in the sense that the amount of backward and forward scattering are the same , the mie phase function is asymmetric .",
    "the larger the size of the dust particulate , the greater the effect of the mie scattering .    when there are dust clouds at or above the photosphere , the albedo is high .",
    "conversely , when clouds are absent , the albedo in the mostly absorbing atmosphere is low ( burrows et al .",
    "2001 ) . as a consequence , in the atmosphere of cool brown dwarf such as gl229b , contribution of scattering is negligible and",
    "so there will be no polarization .",
    "if the mean particle size is small , say @xmath62 , the albedo beyond near infra - red is zero as the mie scattering cross section goes over to that of the rayleigh and the scattering cross section of various molecules present in the atmosphere is negligibly small or zero .",
    "therefore scattering polarization can arise only up to the optical and near infra - red region where the contribution of scattering cross section to the total extinction co - efficient is significant .",
    "it should be mentioned that grains with small size can not contribute significantly to the opacities in the near - infrared where water bands still dominate the spectra of brown dwarf from j to k band .    on the other hand",
    "if we consider larger particle size , then scattering will contribute to the far infra - red region as well .",
    "the degree of polarization due to multiple scattering is presented in figure  2 . here",
    "we notice that the degree of polarization is almost zero at @xmath63 and onwards when the mean particle size is @xmath62 .. shortwards of @xmath64 the degree of polarization increases .",
    "this is because of the fact that scattering is negligible at wavelengths greater than @xmath64 . as the wavelength decreases , the effect of dust scattering increases .",
    "as a consequence the radiation field gets polarized due to scattering and the degree of polarization increases with the decrease in the wavelength .",
    "the degree of polarization always remains negative .",
    "if we consider dust particles with larger mean radius , say @xmath65 , then most of the flux get blocked in the optical region . as a result",
    "the degree of polarization decreases significantly in the optical region .",
    "however , when the size of the particle is comparable to the wavelength , degree of polarization increases significantly .",
    "figure  2 shows that the degree of polarization decreases in the optical region if the the particle size is comparatively large . in the infra - red and far infra - red , degree of polarization increases if the grain size is increased .",
    "it s worth mentioning that multiple scattering decreases the degree of polarization as compared to that with single scattering .",
    "the important message that is conveyed in this letter is that the continuum radiation from the atmosphere of relatively warm brown dwarfs where the dust particulates are not gravitationally settled should be polarized and the polarized radiation could provide a lot of information on the properties of dust particulates . since , no polarization will occur in the absence of dust grains , observation of polarized radiation will also help in deciding if a particular brown dwarf contains dust in its atmosphere .",
    "rapid rotation would impose non - sphericity in the shape of brown dwarfs . as a result ,",
    "a net non - zero polarization integrated over the stellar disc should be obtained .",
    "the results strongly suggest that the polarimetric observations posses a great diagnostic potential for the understanding of the properties of dust particulates . furthermore ,",
    "if no polarization is observed from any particular brown dwarf then that will indicate the absence of dust in its atmosphere .",
    "we thank m. marley for kindly providing the temperature - pressure profile and d. saumon for the continuum opacity data .",
