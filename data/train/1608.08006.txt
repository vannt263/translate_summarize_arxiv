    "singular points of different type are very known in mathematics .",
    "one example are the so - called _ exceptional points _ ( eps ) which are known in mathematics for many years @xcite .",
    "consider a family of operators of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a scalar parameter , @xmath2 is an unperturbed operator and @xmath3 is a perturbation .",
    "kato @xcite has shown that the number of eigenvalues of @xmath4 is independent of @xmath1 , as expected , however with the exception of some special values of @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding points in the parameter space are called eps . here , ( at least ) two eigenvalues coalesce .",
    "an example is @xmath5 in which the two values @xmath6 and @xmath7 result in the same eigenvalue @xmath8 .",
    "now the question arises : what about physics ?",
    "do exceptional points exist ?",
    "what about the eigenfunctions under the influence of an exceptional point ? can exceptional points be observed ?",
    "do exceptional points influence the dynamics of quantum systems ?",
    "some of these questions are studied in literature during last about twenty years , in classical as well as in quantum physics .",
    "we will not discuss here the problems of classical physics .",
    "instead we refer to the excellent book @xcite and to the collection of articles on spectral analysis , stability and bifurcation in modern nonlinear physical systems @xcite . in quantum physics the problems are studied , unfortunately , in a confusing and often contradictory manner .",
    "we will not enumerate here the references to the different papers .",
    "they will rather be cited in those sections of the present paper in which they can be discussed consistently .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to find an answer to the above formulated questions in a mathematically exact manner , however by keeping in mind that points in the continuum are of measure zero and can not be observed directly .",
    "it is important therefore to point to observable signatures of the eps @xcite occurring in physical values , by means of which their existence can be proven .",
    "this is , e.g. , avoided level crossing and formation of different time scales in the two - level case .",
    "similar signatures exist in the three and more level cases .",
    "most interesting is the so - called _ external mixing ( em ) _ of the states via the common continuum into which the system is embedded .",
    "many years ago , em has been shown to play an important role in the open quantum mechanical nuclear system ( continuum shell model in contrast to the standard shell model ) @xcite .",
    "today we know that it characterizes the main features of the influence of eps on the dynamics of an open quantum system , see the recent review @xcite on experimental and theoretical results .",
    "an example of em has been provided experimentally a few years ago in a mesoscopic system .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that two distinct quantum states are coupled through a common continuum . in a further experiment ,",
    "the authors were able to show that em survives even under conditions of strongly nonequilibrium transport in the system @xcite .    in the following sections , we consider first the hamiltonian which describes the properties of an open quantum system .",
    "by definition , an open quantum system is localized in space and embedded in the continuum of scattering wavefunctions due to which the states of the system become resonance states and have , generally , a finite lifetime .",
    "this hamiltonian is non - hermitian as will be shown in sect .",
    "[ ham ] . in the following two sections ,",
    "we consider the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a @xmath9 and of a @xmath10 non - hermitian hamilton operator ( sects . [ eigf2 ] and [ eigf3 ] , respectively ) .",
    "the eigenstates are coupled via one common continuum and show the typical em .",
    "the eigenfunctions of a non - hermitian hamilton operator are biorthogonal , and their phases are not rigid in approaching an ep .",
    "we show in the next section [ nonl ] that the eps cause nonlinear effects in an open quantum system .",
    "they can be traced best in the resonance structure of the scattering cross section under the condition that it is influenced by two adjoining eps .",
    "the further results given in sect . [ smatr1c ] show that , in the one - channel case , the resonance structure of the cross section is almost independent of the em .",
    "it is therefore impossible to reason , in this case , the existence of eps from a study of the resonance structure of the cross section .",
    "the situation is different in the case with two ( or more ) channels as discussed in sect .",
    "[ smatr2c ] . here , eps and em cause interesting observable effects .    in the last section [ concl ] , we summarize the obtained results and add some general remarks . by doing this ,",
    "we hope to stimulate experimental studies in order to prove , on the one hand , the theoretical results , and to use , on the other hand , the rich possibilities they provide for applications .",
    "the natural environment of a localized quantum mechanical system is the extended continuum of scattering wavefunctions in which the system is embedded .",
    "this environment can be changed by means of external forces , however it can never be deleted .",
    "it exists at all times and is completely independent of any observer . for this reason , radioactive",
    "dating can be used in geologic studies .    according to this statement",
    ", the properties of an open quantum system can be described by means of two projection operators each of which is related to one of the two parts of the function space .",
    "the localized part of the quantum system is basic for spectroscopic studies .",
    "mathematically , the localized part of the open quantum system is a subsystem that is related to another subsystem .",
    "the hamiltonian of the ( localized ) system is therefore non - hermitian while the hamiltonian of the total system consisting of the two subsystems , is hermitian .    in the standard description of a localized quantum system ,",
    "an em of the states does not exist .",
    "the system is considered to be closed ; the hamiltonian is hermitian ; the eigenstates are discrete .",
    "their decay is described by tunneling of particles into the function space of scattering states into which the system is embedded .",
    "the tunneling time can be calculated .",
    "it is small and could be measured experimentally only recently @xcite .",
    "the experimental results have shown that the tunneling time is extremely small what does not correspond to the expectations of standard hermitian quantum physics .",
    "they agree , however , with the conclusions obtained when the system is considered to be an open system described by a non - hermitian hamilton operator . in this case , the eigenvalues @xmath11 of the system are complex and the lifetime of the states is given by im(@xmath11 ) .",
    "there is no need to consider any tunneling time .    in a similar manner ,",
    "the problem of the schrdinger cat does not exist when the system is considered to be an open quantum system .",
    "the price to be paid for this is to describe the system by a non - hermitian hamilton operator and to solve the involved mathematical problems .",
    "let us consider the @xmath9 non - hermitian matrix @xmath12 here , @xmath13 are the complex eigenvalues of the basic non - hermitian operator @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 stand for the coupling matrix elements of the two states via the common environment .",
    "they are complex where re(@xmath14 ) is the principal value integral and im(@xmath14 ) is the residuum @xcite .",
    "the non - hermitian matrix @xmath15 describes the system without any mixing of its states via the environment . in other words",
    ", @xmath16 corresponds to vanishing em of the eigenstates .    in this paper ,",
    "our main interest is in the effects caused by @xmath14 .",
    "most visible are the changes in the widths of the states : the original widths @xmath17 of the states turn into the widths @xmath18 of the eigenstates of @xmath19 due to @xmath20 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath21 of @xmath19 are , generally , complex : @xmath22 with @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the energy and @xmath18 the width of the eigenstate @xmath25 .",
    "the properties of the @xmath11 trajectories as a function of a certain parameter are well known .",
    "they contain    _  level repulsion : _ : :    two states repel each other in accordance with re@xmath26 ; _  width bifurcation : _ : :    the widths of two states bifurcate in accordance with    im@xmath26 ; _  avoided level crossing : _ : :    two discrete ( or narrow resonance ) states avoid crossing ( * ? ? ?",

    "altogether , the crossing scenario that is caused by an ep in non - hermitian quantum physics , with , generally , complex eigenvalues @xmath30 of the hamiltonian , needs to be considered in terms of a combined behavior of energy ( @xmath24 ) and width ( @xmath18 ) trajectories of the two states @xmath31 .",
    "a level repulsion will generally appear in the re@xmath32 trajectories together with a free crossing of the im@xmath33 trajectories ; while a bifurcation of the widths @xmath18 is accompanied , generally , by a free crossing of the energy trajectories @xmath34 .",
    "the last case is illustrated , some years ago , in figs .",
    "1 to 3 of the paper @xcite .",
    "sometimes , the crossing phenomenon in non - hermitian quantum physics is called _ avoided level crossing in the complex plane _ , e.g. @xcite . in the present paper we use the term _ avoided level crossing _ or _ level repulsion _ according to the standard definition for the re@xmath35 trajectories ; while the term _ width bifurcation _ is used for the corresponding phenomenon appearing in the im@xmath36 trajectories .",

    "this means that the resonance structure of the cross section is almost independent of em , i.e. on the coupling of the states via one common continuum of scattering states .",
    "this unexpected result can be explained in the following manner .",
    "the evolution of the system between the two eps is driven exclusively by the nonlinear source term of the schrdinger equation ( [ eif11 ] ) since @xmath14 is constant in our calculations and can therefore not be responsible for the width bifurcation . obviously , the nonlinear source term is able , in the one - channel case , to largely conserve the resonance structure of the cross section .",
    "altogether , we have here some type of self - affirmation . analytical results for the resonance structure of the cross section",
    "can be obtained , in the one - channel case ( with well separated resonances ) , when the system is described by a hermitian operator the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of which are smoothly parameter dependent .",
    "these results agree quite well with those of experimental observations . the description of the system as a closed system seems therefore to be justified .",
    "in addition , more complicated cases with e.g. more than one open channel , can not be solved analytically in the standard theory .",

    "the study of more complicated cases is needed , see the next section [ smatr2c ] .",
    "we mention here that the resonance scattering at third - order eps is studied in @xcite by using a method that is different from ours .",

    "the calculations are performed first in the tight - binding approach according to the formalism presented by datta @xcite .",
    "then , the non - hermitian hamilton operator is diagonalized and the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are determined .",

    "the results are more interesting than those for the one - channel case discussed in sect .",
    "[ smatr1c ] since the influence of eps and em can be seen immediately according to the results shown in @xcite .",
    "the resonance structure of the transmission can be traced back to the eigenvalues of the non - hermitian operator ; em of the states can generally not be neglected ; and the phase rigidity is anticorrelated with the transmission probability .",
