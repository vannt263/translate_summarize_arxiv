    "solutions of the classical field equations in minkowski space have been widely used in recent years to describe long - distance properties of quantum fields that require a nonperturbative analysis .",
    "these applications include : the diffusion rate of the topological charge in the electroweak gauge theory @xcite , the thermalization rate of non - abelian gauge fields @xcite , as well as a wide range of cosmological problems , such as thermalization , decoherence , and structure formation @xcite .",
    "many of these studies are concerned with dynamical properties of quantum fields near thermal equilibrium .",
    "classical treatments of the long - distance dynamics of bosonic quantum fields at high temperature are based on the observation that the average thermal amplitude of low - momentum modes is large . for a weakly coupled quantum field",
    "the occupation number of a mode with wave vector * p * and frequency @xmath1 is given by the bose distribution @xmath2 for temperatures @xmath3 much higher than the ( dynamical ) mass scale @xmath4 of the quantum field , the occupation number becomes large and approaches the classical equipartition limit @xmath5 the classical field equations should provide a good approximation for the dynamics of such highly occupied modes . , where @xmath6 is a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "hence , the validity of ( [ climit ] ) requires weak coupling . on the other hand ,",
    "rapid thermalization and decoherence of the soft modes requires that the coupling to the heat bath is sufficiently strong @xcite .",
    "it needs to be established whether both conditions can be satisfied simultaneously . ]    at a closer look , however , the cogency of this heuristic argument suffers considerably .",
    "the thermodynamics of a classical field is only defined if an ultraviolet cut - off @xmath7 is imposed on the momentum * p * such as a finite lattice spacing @xmath8 .",
    "many , if not most , thermodynamical properties of the classical field depend strongly on the value of the cut - off parameter @xmath7 and diverge in the continuum limit @xmath9 .",
    "examples are the energy density @xmath10 and the dynamical mass gap @xmath11 in the high - temperature limit ( and for @xmath12 ) , which contrasts with the results @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the full quantum theory .",
    "remarkably , some thermodynamic quantities , such as the diffusion rate of the topological charge @xcite in non - abelian gauge theories or the maximal lyapunov exponent @xcite , which is equivalent to the damping rate of soft thermal excitations @xcite , are found to be insensitive to the cut - off , attaining a finite value in the continuum limit .",
    "the question arises whether the value reached in the continuum limit agrees with the one obtained in the full thermal quantum field theory , if a complete nonperturbative calculation were feasible .",
    "naively , one expects that any quantity that is independent of @xmath15 in the lowest order of its coupling constant expansion  such as quantities that contain only the combination @xmath16 in thermal non - abelian gauge theories  should be reliably calculable in the classical limit .",
    "of course , there will exist quantum corrections which are suppressed by powers of the coupling constant @xmath17 , i.e. such a quantity will have a perturbative expansion of the form @xmath18 where only the coefficient @xmath19 is calculable classically , but the coefficients @xmath20 can be obtained using perturbative techniques .    other questions also arise : what coupling constant @xmath6 should be used in the classical calculation ?",
    "how is it renormalized ?",
    "how does mass renormalization enter into the equation for the low - momentum modes that are described classically ?",
    "how does the classical equation `` know '' that it derives its justification from the classical limit of a thermal quantum field ?",
    "how does the temperature enter into the classical equation ?",
    "which mechanism ensures that the attained temperature equals that of the underlying thermal field theory , if the classically described modes thermalize due to their interaction ?    some of these questions were addressed in recent articles @xcite ; others remain unanswered .",
    "here we make an attempt to address the complex of questions in its entirety , applying the method of effective field theories and the real - time formulation of finite temperature quantum field theory .",
    "our approach leads us to the formulation of an effective dynamics for the soft modes of the quantum field in terms of a stochastic , dissipative action .",
    "the stochastic forces describe the exchange of energy and other quantum numbers with the perturbatively treated hard modes , and the dissipative terms describe the eventual approach to thermal equilibrium of the soft modes .",
    "a fluctuation - dissipation theorem ensures that the soft modes reach the same temperature as the hard modes with which they interact .",
    "we perform our analysis for the simplest nontrivial example : a massive scalar field with quartic self - interaction in ( @xmath21 ) dimensions .",
    "this allows us to evade the technical difficulties associated with gauge invariance and to make contact with previous work @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that a similar issue arises in the euclidean formulation of thermal non - abelian gauge theories , because thermodynamic quantities , such as the pressure or screening masses , receive contributions at a scale @xmath22 , which are essentially classical and usually can not be calculated by means of perturbative methods .",
    "recently , braaten and nieto @xcite have shown how low - energy effective actions in euclidean space can be utilized to systematically resolve this problem .",
    "the analogous problem in minkowski space is more complicated , since dimensional reduction @xcite does not occur in this case because at finite temperature there is no gap in the excitation spectrum . in this case",
    "the effective long - distance field theory becomes essentially classical , because quantal loop corrections are suppressed by powers of @xmath23 where @xmath7 is the ultraviolet cut - off of the effective theory .",
    "however , the dynamics retains its full @xmath24 dimensionality .",
    "our manuscript is organized as follows : in the next section we first review the concepts of effective actions and influence functionals .",
    "we then derive the influence functional for a self - coupled scalar quantum field and obtain the classical , stochastic equations of motion for the soft field modes . in section iii",
    "we show in detail how dissipation emerges from the effective equation of motion and how the proper markovian limit of the corresponding nonlocal terms can be obtained .",
    "section iv briefly considers the generalization of our results to gauge theories and presents a discussion of some open issues .",
    "our goal is the derivation of an effective action for the classical dynamics in minkowski space of the low - momentum modes of a scalar quantum field @xmath25 near thermal equilibrium .",
    "following bdeker , mclerran , and smilga @xcite and lombardo and mazzitelli @xcite , we divide the fourier components of the field @xmath25 into low - momentum modes with @xmath26 ( henceforth called `` soft '' modes ) and high - momentum modes with @xmath27 ( called `` hard '' modes from now on ) by defining ; in that of ref .",

    "@xmath42 already accounts for all thermal and quantal corrections and determines , in addition to the evolution of the field expectation value , all @xmath43-point functions of the field . on the other hand ,",
    "if the low - momentum field modes are governed by truly nonperturbative physics , such as in the case of non - abelian gauge theories at high temperature , we have to rely on a numerical treatment of the long - distance dynamics on the basis of @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "the major advantage then is that all the short - distance dynamics that can be treated perturbatively is already contained in the effective action @xmath45 , thus the numerical evaluation can concentrate on the nonperturbative sector alone where quantal corrections among the soft modes are of minor importance while classical ( thermal ) effects dominate .",
    "the derivation of an effective equation of motion for the soft modes by elimination of the fast modes corresponds to a coarse graining of the quantum field . in the spirit of the general formalism of quantum statistics , the assumption of thermal equilibrium for the eliminated modes",
    "can be interpreted as one of minimal information about the microscopic quantum state of the hard modes .",
    "the general theory of coarse graining @xcite then permits several statements about the nature of the effective dynamics of the soft modes :    1 .",
    "the mass parameters and the coupling constants are renormalized , and new effective interactions , which are in general nonlocal , will appear .",
    "the dynamics is dissipative and contains noise terms satisfying a fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the semiclassical real - time evolution is inherently stochastic , reflecting the coupling of the soft modes to the heat reservoir of hard thermal modes .",

    "a change of the system ( here the soft modes ) influences the heat bath which in turn responds causally back onto the system .",
