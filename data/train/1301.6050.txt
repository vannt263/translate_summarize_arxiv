    "colloidal suspensions have been widely studied for a variety of applications . from the point of view of basic science , a growing interest stems from the fact that colloidal suspensions are many - particle systems that are easier to observe than molecular systems .",

    ", notable attention has been devoted both to the determination of the equilibrium properties of binary suspensions @xcite , with the calculation of phase diagrams of representative model systems , and to their aggregation kinetics @xcite",
    ". however , several aspects of heteroaggregation are still to be understood , especially for what concerns the basic mechanisms that determine the structures obtained in the actual aggregation processes .",
    "an important issue in this colloidal aggregation is to determine to what extent the structures that are actually formed in the growth of colloidal crystals reflect their thermodynamic equilibrium structures .",
    "this has been investigated in the case of the heteroaggregation of colloids interacting through screened electrostatic forces by sanz et al .",
    "@xcite , in the case of high volume fraction @xmath0 . in their simulations ,",
    "sanz et al . used the forward - flux sampling method @xcite to determine nucleation rates .",
    "they found that highest nucleation rate was associated to the formation of a substitutionally disordered fcc crystal , which is neither the lowest free - energy phase nor the phase characterized by the lowest free - energy barrier for nucleation from the melt .",
    "in fact , the lowest free - energy structure is of cesium - chloride ( cscl ) type .",
    "sanz et al .",
    "attributed this finding to the fact that sub - critical small clusters have disordered fcc structures , so that growth continues keeping this kind of structure because the transition to the cscl structure is kinetically inhibited .    in this article",

    "we analyze also the importance of hydrodynamic effects in the nucleation of the nacl phase by performing stochastic rotation dynamics - molecular dynamics ( srd - md ) simulations @xcite , which show that these effects do not play a major role .",
    "in our simulations the interaction potential between the colloids is of the form @xmath9 where @xmath4 is a constant , which gives the value of the potential at contact , and the sign of the charge @xmath10 depends on the colloid @xmath11 and being either of type a or b. in the following we use @xmath12 .",

    "the aggregate does not show any long - range order , but a liquid - like structure , in which some colloids surrounded by a nacl - type short - range order can be singled out .",
    "after a lengthy evolution in this disordered phase , there is a rather sudden increase of @xmath55 , which jumps to a value of 0.4 , corresponding to the transformation of the disordered aggregate into an ordered nacl - type crystallite , as the one shown in snapshot a2 of fig .",

    ", the sudden transition to the ordered crystallite takes place , but this time the structure is of cscl type ( b2 in fig .",

    "starting from diluted configurations ( @xmath68 ) dense aggregates form with a metastable liquid - like structure which survives for some time .",
    "however , a transition to an ordered structure finally takes place , and the type of ordered structure is correlated , with very high probability , with the features of short - range order in the metastable liquid , as described for example by the parameter @xmath55 . specifically we find that the final structure is almost always of nacl type for disordered aggregates in which @xmath69 , while for @xmath70 the cscl structure is found in most cases .",
    "this means that the final ordered structure can be predicted with high probability by inspecting the relative positions of the colloids in the disordered state .",

    "these configurations would be indeed energetically favorable , because the cscl phase is still the most stable from this point of view , but they are very difficult to reach in an aggregation process starting from a dilute volume fraction .",
    "this is the cause of the formation of crystallites of the metastable nacl phase .",
    "once formed , these crystallites can survive for long lifetimes .",
    "rather surprisingly , we note that the formation of nacl - type crystallites is indeed easier when this bulk phase is metastable .",
    "we have in fact tried aggregation simulations for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , a situation in which the nacl bulk phase is more stable than the cscl phase due to entropic effects @xcite .",
    "however , the long range of the repulsion between particles with the same charge renders the aggregation itself quite difficult , so that we were not able to observe any crystallization within @xmath77 .",
    "finally we discuss the importance of hydrodynamic effects by comparing the results of bd and srd - md .",
    "the srd - md is much heavier computationally than bd so that it is very cumbersome to simulate the entire process of two - step aggregation and reorganization , because the nucleation of the ordered phase from the liquid can occur after very long times . for this reason",
    "we have decided to restrict the comparison to the analysis of the crucial parts of the process .",
    "first of all , we have started both bd and srd - md from initial randomly dispersed non - overlapping configurations and analyzed the initial aggregation stage , leading to the formation of the disordered liquid - like phase , to check whether this phase forms on the same time scale and presents the same properties in both bd and srd - md .",

    "in this work we have analyzed the heteroaggregation of oppositely charged colloids by means of a combination of different simulation techniques , including brownian dynamics , global optimization searches and stochastic rotation dynamics - molecular dynamics .",
    "aggregation in dilute systems has been considered .",

    "our simulations show that , if the range of the potential is sufficiently long ( @xmath74 ) , kinetic effects cause the formation of crystallites of the metastable nacl - type bulk phase , which thus can be obtained also for binary colloids of same size and balanced charge .",
    "these crystallites form within a two - step mechanism , in which the first step is the aggregation of a dense metastable liquid whose short - range order has prevailing nacl features .",
