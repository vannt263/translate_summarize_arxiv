    "recent interests in einstein theory of general relativity in five and higher dimensions have been remarkable .",
    "higher dimensional extensions to general relativity were originally started with the work of kaluza and klein ( kk ) with the addition of one extra dimension and subsequently generalized to more extra dimensions by various authors @xcite . since the observable universe seems to be 4-dimensional , these extra dimensions are assumed to have compact topology with certain compactification scale @xmath1 so that at scales much larger than @xmath1 , such dimensions would not be observable .",
    "if they exist , we may detect them at very short distances or high energies . another way to display the invisibility of extra dimensions",
    "is to assume that the standard matter is confined to a brane embedded in a higher dimensional bulk manifold while the extra dimensions may only be probed by gravitons .",
    "such scenarios may be collectively termed as brane theory .",
    "in this paper we focus attention on the induced matter ( i m ) theory @xcite .",
    "this theory is different from the classical kk scenario by the fact that it has a noncompact fifth dimension and that the @xmath2 bulk space is devoid of matter . for this reason",
    "it is called induced matter theory where the effective @xmath3 matter is a consequence of the geometry of the bulk . that is , in i m theory , the @xmath2 bulk space is ricci - flat while the @xmath3 hypersurface is curved by the @xmath3 induced matter .",
    "we will extend the i m ideas to @xmath4 bulk and ask the following question : if the world has more than four dimensions and is described by a theory like general relativity why do we live in a @xmath3 universe and what conditions restrict us to experience physics in @xmath3 ? in @xcite the authors discussed the general conditions for stabilization of test particles in a brane world scenario with an arbitrary dimensional bulk space that satisfy einstein field equations . in brane models the matter fields are confined to a fixed brane via a delta function or confining potential @xcite . in i",
    "m theories however , the matter fields are not confined to a fixed hypersurface and hence test particles , for example , can propagate in the bulk space and live on a fixed brane .",
    "we will show that if the energy - momentum tensor of the matter field satisfies what we call the machian strong energy condition ( msec ) on the four velocity of a test particle and the number of extra dimensions is greater than one , then the test particle is stabilized about our fixed brane and would not disappear .",
    "the organization of paper is as follows : in section 2 we give a brief review of the geometrical definitions . in section 3",
    "we describe the dynamics of test particles .",
    "section 4 deals with the stabilization conditions of such particles and in section 5 we present an example for the stabilization of test particles in a frw universe .",
    "conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "consider the background manifold @xmath5 isometrically embedded in @xmath6 by a map @xmath7 such that @xmath8where @xmath9 @xmath10 is the metric of the bulk ( brane ) space @xmath11 in an arbitrary coordinate , @xmath12 @xmath13 are the basis of the bulk ( brane ) and @xmath14 are @xmath15 normal unit vectors orthogonal to the brane .",
    "perturbation of @xmath5 in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the brane along an arbitrary transverse direction @xmath16 is given by @xmath17where @xmath18 represents the lie derivative . by choosing @xmath19 orthogonal to the brane we ensure gauge independency @xcite and have perturbations of the embedding along a single orthogonal extra direction @xmath20 , giving the local coordinates of the perturbed brane as @xmath21where @xmath22 are small parameters along @xmath23 parameterizing the extra noncompact dimensions",
    "also , one can see from equation ( [ b ] ) that since the vectors @xmath24 depend only on the local coordinates @xmath25 , they do not propagate along the extra dimensions @xmath26^{a}=\\bar{{\\cal n}}_{\\,\\,\\ a}^{a}. \\label{d}\\]]the above assumptions lead to the embedding equations of the perturbed geometry @xmath27if we set @xmath28 , the metric of the bulk space can be written in the following matrix form ( gaussian frame ) @xmath29where @xmath30is the metric of the perturbed brane , so that @xmath31represents the extrinsic curvature of the original brane ( second fundamental form ) .",
    "also , we use the notation @xmath32 , where @xmath33represent the twisting vector fields ( normal fundamental form ) .",
    "any fixed @xmath34 signifies a new perturbed geometry , enabling us to define an extrinsic curvature similar to the original one by @xmath35note that definitions ( [ f ] ) , ( [ g ] ) and ( [ j ] ) require @xmath36 in geometric language , the presence of gauge fields @xmath37 tilts the embedded family of sub - manifolds with respect to the normal vector @xmath38 . according to our construction ,",
    "the original brane is orthogonal to the normal vector @xmath39 however , equation ( [ e ] ) shows that this is not true for the deformed geometry .",
    "let us change the embedding coordinates and set @xmath40the coordinates @xmath41 describe a new family of embedded manifolds whose members are always orthogonal to @xmath42 . in this coordinates , the embedding equations of the perturbed brane is similar to the original one described by equations ( [ mama41 ] ) , so that @xmath43 is replaced by @xmath44 .",
    "this new embedding of the local coordinates are suitable for obtaining induced einstein field equations on the brane .",
    "we will return to this point later in section 4 .",
    "the extrinsic curvature of the perturbed brane then becomes @xmath45which is the generalized york relation and shows how the extrinsic curvature propagates as a result of the propagation of the metric in the direction normal to the original brane .",
    "in general , the new sub - manifold is an embedding in such a way that the geometry and topology of the bulk space do not become fixed @xcite .",
    "we now show that if the bulk space has certain killing vector fields then @xmath46 transform as the components of a gauge vector field under the group of isometries of the bulk . under a local infinitesimal coordinate transformation for extra dimensions we have @xmath47assuming the coordinates of the brane",
    "are fixed , that is @xmath48 and defining @xmath49then in the gaussian coordinates of the bulk ( [ f ] ) we have @xmath50hence the transformation of @xmath46 becomes @xmath51now , using @xmath52 and @xmath53 we obtain @xmath54}^{c}+{\\cal m}% _ { ab,\\mu } .",
    "\\label{r}\\]]this is exactly the gauge transformation of a yang - mills gauge potential . in our model",
    "the gauge potential can only be present if the dimension of the bulk space is equal to or greater than six @xmath55 , because the gauge fields @xmath46 are antisymmetric under the exchange of extra coordinate indices @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "recently there has been an interest in finding kk gravitational models for which the bulk space is not only ricci flat but also riemann flat ( @xmath58 ) @xcite .",
    "the vanishing of the riemann tensor means that we have the analog of minkowski space - time in @xmath59-dimensions . in this case , the bulk is empty but we have an observable @xmath60-dimensional curved universe that contains the induced matter fields .",
    "now , let the bulk space be of minkowskian type with signature @xmath61 .",
    "the tangent space of the brane has signature @xmath62 implying that the orthogonal space has the isometry group @xmath63 .",

    "let us note that the orthogonal part of @xmath108 does not vanish here .",
    "this is an interesting result , for all known basic @xmath3 forces lead to accelerations that are orthogonal to the @xmath3 velocity of the particle .",
    "some authors @xcite relate this timelike acceleration to @xmath3 physics by assuming that the invariantinertial mass of a test particle varies along its worldline and the timelike acceleration corresponds to this variation of the inertial mass . in what follows ,",
    "we see how this idea can be generalized .    to obtain the effective @xmath3 observable mass @xmath107 that an observer measures , consider lagrangian ( [ eq1 ] ) from which the momentum conjugate to @xmath79 is @xmath109so that from the line element ( [ eq4 ] ) we have @xmath110 in order to obtain the induced mass and charge of test particles we project the @xmath59-momenta @xmath111 into four dimensions .",
    "this projection is done by the vielbeins @xmath112 @xcite @xmath113 now , a glance at the above equation shows that the choice @xmath114renders @xmath115 as the canonical momenta given by @xmath116 . using the above relation and equation ( [ mama3 ] )",
    "we have @xmath117 on the other hand , using ( [ eq11 ] ) , ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ mama3 ] ) we find the following differential equations for the charge and mass of the particle @xmath118@xmath119the general solutions of these equations for @xmath120 can be written in the following form @xmath121where @xmath122 satisfies the differential equation @xmath123so that relation ( [ eq5 ] ) implies @xmath124 with @xmath125 being the solution of the following differential equation @xmath126the above solutions will change when the mass of the particle vanishes in the bulk space , that is @xmath127 , leading to @xmath128where @xmath129 is the constant of integration satisfying @xmath130  and @xmath131 and @xmath122 satisfy @xmath132finally , from equations ( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) we have @xmath133 where @xmath134 equation ( [ taze4 ] ) shows that manifestations of the extra force , as viewed by the @xmath3 observer , are embodied in the variation of inertial mass and charge of the particle .",
    "generally speaking , in non - compact multidimensional theories of gravity our ordinary space - time may be represented as a @xmath3 sub - manifold locally and isometrically embedded in an @xmath4 bulk space . in these theories , we assume that the path of test particles correspond to curves in @xmath4 bulk manifolds , in contrast to brane models where test particles are necessarily confined to the @xmath3 sub - manifold .",
    "the interesting question at this point comes from the equation of motion represented by ( [ e ] ) which describes the motion of a particle along extra dimensions .",
    "this equation shows that the test particle can not be solely confined to the background brane @xmath135 but would propagate along the extra dimensions too .",

    "let us then start by making a quick look at the generalized @xmath59-dimensional i m theory .",
    "this would help us to grasp the salient points of our discussion more easily .",
    "in this theory , the motivation for assuming the existence of large extra dimensions was to achieve the unification of matter and geometry , _ i.e. _ , to obtain the properties of matter as a consequence of extra dimensions . in the i m approach ,",

    "using equations ( [ eq59 ] ) and ( [ eq60 ] ) we obtain the following relation between the einstein tensors of the bulk and brane @xmath149where @xmath150 and @xmath151 are the einstein tensors of the bulk and brane respectively , and @xmath152now , decomposing the riemann tensor of the bulk space into the weyl and ricci tensors and ricci scalar and using equation ( [ eq56 ] ) , the einstein field equations induced on the brane become @xmath153where @xmath154 is the electric part of the weyl tensor @xmath155 .",
    "note that directly from definition of @xmath156 it follows that it is independently a conserved quantity , that is @xmath157 .",
    "all of the above quantities in equation ( [ eq63 ] ) are obtained on the perturbed brane since , according to the second equation of motion ( [ d ] ) , the matter can not exactly be confined to the original non perturbed brane .",
    "hence from a @xmath3 point of view , the empty @xmath4 equations look like einstein equations with induced matter .",
    "the electric part of the weyl tensor is well known from the brane point of view .",
    "it describe a traceless matter , denoted by dark radiation or weyl matter . as was mentioned before",

    "the author of reference @xcite tried to relate this quantity to the matter content of the universe via the following setup : from equation ( [ eq56 ] ) , the trace of the codazzi equation ( [ eq58 ] ) in @xmath2 gives the gravi - vector equation @xmath159where @xmath160 .",
    "decomposing it we have @xmath161where @xmath162 is a @xmath2 gravitational constant , @xmath73 is the tension of the brane in five dimensions and @xmath163 is the energy - momentum tensor of the standard matter . from the above equations we get @xmath164 .\\]]substituting this equation into ( [ mama15 ] ) , we obtain @xmath165where @xmath166@xmath167and @xmath168it is now seen from equations ( [ eq64 ] ) and ( [ eq65 ] ) that @xmath169also , @xmath170 implies @xmath171these equations , that is ( [ eq67 ] ) , ( [ eq71 ] ) and ( [ eq72 ] ) are similar to that of the sms @xcite brane gravity .",
    "however , it is easily seen that the above results are contradictory . the quantity @xmath158 in equation ( [ eq63 ] )",
    "is conserved and so is @xmath172 .",
    "hence we have @xmath173this equation must be satisfied in our model , but it contradicts equation ( [ eq72 ] ) and hence the validity of relation ( [ eq65 ] ) , made out of matter and extrinsic curvature , is questionable .",
    "on the other hand , by contracting codazzi equation ( [ eq58 ] ) in @xmath4 bulk space , the generalized gravi - vector equation becomes @xmath174from this equation we can not define any suitable relationship like equation ( [ eq65 ] ) between extrinsic curvature and matter contained on the brane . to define a suitable relation we use the following setup . in an arbitrary @xmath59-dimensional bulk space",

    "now , using the decomposition of the riemann tensor in terms of the weyl tensor , one may show that @xmath178and hence the ricci and codazzi relations lead to @xmath179where @xmath180the above considerations lead to @xmath181where @xmath182 ,   \\label{eq80}\\]]and @xmath183 is the four dimensional gravitational constant .",
    "multiplication of equation ( [ eq76 ] ) and ( [ eq77 ] ) by @xmath184 results in the energy - momentum tensor @xmath185 .",
    "\\label{eq888}\\]]this completes the description of the induced einstein equation on the perturbed brane .",
    "multiplication of equations ( [ aa1 ] ) and ( [ aa2 ] ) by @xmath186 in the non - perturbed brane results in @xmath187if we multiply equations ( [ aa1 ] ) and ( [ aa2 ] ) by @xmath188 , we obtain the last term in equation ( [ eq833 ] ) and finally we find @xmath189where @xmath190 and @xmath191 is the induced energy - momentum tensor on the original brane . hence if we assume that , as the generalized coulomb gauge @xmath192 , then using equation ( [ eq83 ] ) in equation ( [ aa ] ) we find @xmath193the last step in obtaining the equation of motion for @xmath136 is done by expanding the 4-velocity @xmath194 and line element @xmath195 in the above equation in terms of the corresponding quantities in the non perturbed brane . after some algebra we obtain @xmath196where @xmath197 and @xmath198 are the line element and 4-velocity defined on the original brane respectively and the quantity @xmath199 is the component of the normal curvature vector @xcite , its magnitude being given by @xmath200 in fact @xmath201 is nothing more than the higher dimensional generalization of the familiar centripetal acceleration .",
    "note that in simplifying equation ( [ mama17 ] ) we have used the expansion of the line element of the bulk space ( [ g ] ) , using the lowest order approximation .",
    "this equation shows that the test particle becomes stable around the original non perturbed brane if the quantity inside the parenthesis is grater than zero .",
    "this , in turn means that the energy - momentum tensor of the matter field satisfies the restricted strong energy condition . as a consequence ,",
    "if the energy - momentum tensor of the matter field vanishes , then according to equations ( [ eq888 ] ) and ( [ mama15 ] ) the extrinsic curvature vanishes .",
    "this means that according to equation ( mama17 ) , the particle becomes totally unstable , its stability becoming dependent on the existence of matter distribution over the whole universe .",
    "such a result seems to be in accordance with the mach s principle and for this reason we may call the above energy condition as machian .    at this point",
    "the question may arise as to even if the particle motion is stabilized , we must make sure that the disappearance of particles do not occur in our @xmath3 universe .",
    "in what follows , we show that in low energy physics , particles are gravitationally trapped very near to our brane .",
    "the dynamical equation ( [ mama17 ] ) shows that the potential energy acting on the particle along the extra dimensions is @xmath202 according to equation ( [ eq332 ] ) , components of the normal curvature vector are proportional to the variation of the rest mass of particles .",
    "observations shows that this variation is very small .",
    "in addition , if we assume that the energy momentum tensor of the matter content of the universe in the low energy regime is proportional to the energy density @xmath203 , then by neglecting the last term in equation ( [ mama17 ] ) , equation ( [ mama43 ] ) gives @xmath204 where @xmath1 is the typical distanced traversed by the particle along the extra dimensions . however , gravity is of multidimensional nature in the bulk space and if we assume that the trapping of particles is a gravitational effect , then stabilization caused by the potential @xmath205 is equal to the gravitational energy of the induced matter on the original non - perturbed brane , that is @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the fundamental @xmath59-dimensional newton s constant in the bulk space .",
    "now , comparison of equations ( [ mama44 ] ) and ( [ mama45 ] ) points to a similar result presented in @xcite without the product topology , namely @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the energy scale in the bulk space .",
    "assuming that @xmath210 tev , one calculates from equation ( [ mama46 ] ) the value of @xmath1 @xmath211 for one extra dimension , the case commonly used in many i m models , one obtains unacceptable values for @xmath1 . in the case of two extra dimensions , we have that @xmath212 and if we assume @xmath213 , as suggested by superstring theory , one has @xmath214 .",
    "the result is that the motion of test particles along the extra dimensions become very limited and we can not see any disappearance of particles in our @xmath3 space - time at ordinary scales of energy .",
    "note that in this model , the size of the extra dimensions can be very large . to see this ,",
    "let us write the metric of the perturbed brane as @xmath215since @xmath216 , it follows that @xmath217 .",
    "therefore , @xmath136 can not be a solution of @xmath218the solutions of the above equation is defined as the curvature radii of the background brane corresponding to each curvature line @xmath219 and normal @xmath220 , satisfying @xmath221it follows that the metric of the perturbed brane becomes singular at the solutions of equation ( [ mama21 ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath222 and consequently the metric of the bulk , become also singular at the points determined by those solutions .",
    "of course this is not a real singularity but a property of the gaussian system .",
    "however , this singularity breaks the continuity and regularity of the gauss - codazzi - ricci equations which are constructed in this system .",
    "therefore , the scale of curvature @xmath223 defined by @xmath224where @xmath225 is the curvature radii , sets a local limit for the region in the bulk accessed by the gravitons .",
    "the behavior of @xmath223 near a space - time singularity depends on the topological nature of that singularity . in the case of a point - like singularity",
    "all values of @xmath225 tend to zero so that @xmath226 also tends to zero . therefore , the movement of particles located near the singularity along the extra dimensions is very limited and stability is again recovered . in the next section",
    "we analyze a toy model to show how our formalism works .",
    "in what follows , we will analyze the stabilization of test particles in a frw universe embedded in an @xmath59-dimensional flat bulk space so that all the extra dimensions are spacelike .",
    "the frw line element ( non perturbed brane ) is written as @xmath227 ,   \\label{eq86}\\]]where @xmath228 corresponds to @xmath229 respectively and @xmath230 is the scale factor .",
    "now , to construct the energy - momentum tensor of the induced matter fields , we compute the components of the extrinsic curvature . from the definition of extrinsic curvature , equation ( [ m ] ) , it follows that for diagonal metric ( eq86 ) , @xmath231 is also diagonal . in this case solving the codazzi equations ( [ eq58 ] ) with the assumption of vanishing twisting vector fields , leads to @xmath232here , @xmath233 are arbitrary functions of @xmath234 .",
    "consequently , the components of @xmath158 become @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the hubble parameter . to proceed with the geometrical interpretation of the energy - momentum tensor ,",
    "let us consider an analogy between @xmath158 and a simple example of matter consisting of identical particles in the form of dust , that is @xmath237 using equations ( [ eq188 ] ) and ( [ eq189 ] ) and assuming that the functions @xmath238 are equal , the energy density takes the following form @xmath239 the @xmath3 einstein equations ( [ eq63 ] ) , using equation ( [ eq188 ] ) , become @xmath240 elimination of @xmath241 from the above equations results in the friedmann equation @xmath242 using equations ( [ eq188 ] ) and ( [ eq189 ] ) we also obtain @xmath243 the solution of equation ( [ mama30 ] ) is @xmath244where @xmath245 is the present value of the scale factor and @xmath246 is an integration constant .",
    "now the friedmann equation becomes @xmath247 where @xmath248 equation ( [ mama32 ] ) is exactly the standard friedmann equation in general relativity for which one has textbook solutions . for a closed universe",
    "we have @xmath249 and @xmath250where @xmath251 and @xmath252 is the so - called development angle . the geodesic equation ( [ mama17 ] ) then becomes @xmath253 it is also worth mentioning that according to equation ( [ mama35 ] ) , for the cases when @xmath254 , since the energy density @xmath255 approaches zero as the time progresses , the particles become unstable on the brane .",
    "however for a closed universe in the conformal time gauge , equation ( [ mama35 ] ) changes to @xmath256 where a prime denotes derivation with respect to @xmath257 .",
    "figure 1 shows variation of @xmath258 , obtained from equation ( [ mama38 ] ) , and the scale factor with respect to time from the big bang to the big crunch .",
    "an interesting comment at this stage relates to the size of extra dimensions . in the previous section",
    ", we argued that the size of extra dimensions are given by the curvature radii .",
    "if we compute the scale of the curvature by using equations ( [ eq188 ] ) , ( [ mama21 ] ) and ( [ mama23 ] ) we find @xmath259 showing that the average size of the extra dimensions is very large . however , the multidimensional nature of gravity in the bulk space , represented through equation ( [ mama47 ] ) , forces the particles becoming trapped near the brane .",
    "we have studied a model in which a @xmath3 brane is embedded in an @xmath59-dimensional bulk . in so far as a test particle moving in such a bulk space is concerned , a @xmath3 observer would detect a @xmath3 mass and yang - mills charges stemming from oscillations of the particle along directions perpendicular to the brane if the confined matter satisfies the machian strong energy condition and the number of extra dimensions is greater than one . a force is also experienced by the particle which again originates from the effects of the extra dimensions in the form of the extrinsic curvature and yang - mills fields so that the terms arising from the extrinsic curvature are rewritable as variations of the inertial mass and charge of the test particle .",
    "an interesting point is that although our model predicts extra dimensions which can have large sizes , the multi - dimensional nature of gravity in the bulk space and its energy scale forces a test particle to be confined to the brane or very near it .",
    "this result should be viewed in the light of 5-dimensional i m theories commonly used in the literature where the above stability conditions can not be satisfied .",
