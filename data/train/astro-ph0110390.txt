    "modeling the mass distribution within the milky way ( mw ) and m31 galaxies is a classical problem which has seen many past iterations @xcite . because of our unique ability to observe these systems in exquisite detail ,",
    "this problem has continued to be a fertile testing ground for theories of galactic structure and galaxy formation @xcite . in the absence of a coherent halo formation theory ,",
    "early models were plagued by the arbitrary structure parameters of the dark halos .",
    "recent developments in the theory of dark matter halo formation make this sort of modeling much more meaningful because the halo parameters ( such as total mass , peak rotation speed and concentration parameter ) may no longer be considered free parameters but are correlated , and these correlations are specified within the context of a given cold dark matter cosmology ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    while very successful on large scales , the standard cosmological theory is experiencing mounting difficulties on the scales of galaxies and dwarf galaxies .",
    "the so - called `` sub - structure '' problem ( the predicted over - abundance of sub - halos relative to observed dwarf satellites of the mw and the m31 galaxies @xcite ) may have been successfully resolved by invoking the presence of a photoionizing background that `` squelches '' star - formation in small halos @xcite .",
    "however , the so - called `` cusp '' and `` concentration '' problems remain thorny .",
    "the most acute manifestations of these problems are encountered for objects which are dark matter dominated  namely , the central parts of low surface brightness galaxies and dwarf galaxies @xcite . for example , the high central density of dark matter halos appears to be inconsistent with the observed rotation curves of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to ask how  models fare in their predictions for luminous , high surface brightness galaxies , such as the milky way and m31 .",
    "these systems probe the dark matter properties on mass scales of @xmath6 , which are significantly larger than the @xmath7 scales tested by inner rotation curves of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the milky way is particularly interesting for constraining the central cusp of the dark matter because the inner 310  kpc region of the milky way is well studied .",
    "apart from the rotation curve and integrated light distribution , the milky way offers many more opportunities to study very detailed data which are not generally available for extragalactic systems , e.g. individual stellar radial velocities and proper motions in the solar neighbourhood , and recently , galactic bulge microlensing events .",
    "it is likely that the halo of our galaxy consists mostly of weakly interacting elementary particles ( wimps ) rather than black holes or failed stars ( machos ) , a necessary condition to apply the standard cosmological approach .",
    "the very low microlensing counts by machos in the inner 50  kpc halo of the mw imply that elementary particles make up @xmath8 of the halo @xcite",
    ". therefore it should be valid to apply halo formation models to our galaxy , which predict an outer dark matter profile of the form @xmath9 . in this regard , earlier halo models using cored isothermal halos with a @xmath10 outer profile and a divergent mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or very steep outer profiles @xmath11 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are unphysical and should be updated .",
    "@xcite and @xcite were the first to use mass modeling of the milky way to constrain cosmological models .",
    "the dark mass inside the solar radius was compared with observational limits derived from previous mass modeling .",
    "this could give misleading results because of inconsistent modeling of the halo profiles . also unlike in galaxies with low baryon content such as dwarf or lsb galaxies ,",
    "the density of the inner halo can deviate significantly from the original ( nfw ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) profile in high - surface brightness galaxies because of strong compression during the baryonic collapse @xcite . given the coupling of the inner and outer parts of the halo ,",
    "it is necessary to repeat the mass modeling of the milky way and m31 including a self - consistent treatment of the baryons and dark matter component .",
    "the amount of dark matter inside the central @xmath12  kpc of the milky way and m31 introduces another layer of problems .",
    "it is very likely that both galaxies have fast rotating bars . a rotating bar experiences dynamical friction induced by the dark matter .",
    "if the mass of the dark matter surrounding the bar is too large , the dynamical friction could slow down the bar rotation over a short timescale @xcite , in which case , we should not expect to see fast rotating bars . this argument sometimes is presented as the most severe problem the  cosmological models encounter on small scales @xcite .",
    "it is clear that some effect of this kind must exist , but a realistic estimate of its magnitude is still difficult for current analytic works @xcite and @xmath13body simulations @xcite .",
    "the cobe map of the galaxy and the high rate of microlensing events towards the galactic bulge have been used as arguments that most of the inner galaxy s mass is in a heavy stellar bar @xcite .",
    "this leaves very little room for a massive dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "we address these issues in this paper , and will treat them in more detail in a paper in preparation ( zhao et al .",
    "2001 ) .    modeling the milky way and",
    "m31 turns out to be challenging because of their complex formation processes .",
    "the present - day dark matter halos can have density profiles very different from the original dark matter prediction ( e.g. the nfw profile ) .",
    "they are squeezed and deformed by the gravitational force of the baryons , which collapse out of the nfw halo to form heavy disks and dense nuclear bulges .",
    "the amount of squeezing also depends on the angular momentum transfer between the baryons and the dark matter halo .",
    "the dark matter cusp is ellusive to detection because the gravitational force at the center is dominated by the baryons .",
    "apart from detailed data , the milky way provides a good laboratory for studying the transfer of angular momentum from the rapidly rotating baryons to the dark matter halo through dynamical friction .",
    "such a transfer must have taken place in the mw and m31 since both have a prominent triaxial bulge / bar and spiral arms in their disks . an analytic formulation for the angular momentum transfer is given in an accompanying letter ( paper iii ) .",
    "studying the mw halo can set general limits on dark matter halos only if the mw is typical among galaxies that form in a dark matter halo of a given mass .",
    "this `` typicality '' hypothesis can be tested to some degree with our parallel study of the nearby galaxy m31 .",
    "it can also be tested by producing many realizations of a milky way - like galaxy using a monte carlo - based semi - analytic model of galaxy formation .",
    "the semi - analytic approach allows us to make statistical predictions of the formation histories of ensembles of galaxies hosted by halos of a given mass , and to incorporate the combined stochastic effects of distributions of mass accretion and merging history , halo spin parameter , and gas accretion and star formation history .",
    "this approach has the unique ability to allow us to estimate the chances of finding a certain combination of structural parameters that simultaneously produce the observed stellar populations and gravitational potential in galaxies like the mw and m31 .",
    "we pursue this question in a companion paper ( paper ii ) .    in summary ,",
    "the goal of this series of papers is to test whether the current standard theory of galaxy formation , which seems to be very successful on large scales and very problematic on dwarf galaxy scales , can produce @xmath14 galaxies such as the mw and m31 . in this paper , this is done by combining classical dynamical modeling of detailed data for the mw and m31 with current cosmologically - based models of dark halos and disk formation .",
    "in traditional mass models of the mw one decomposes the baryons into several descriptive components : the nucleus , the bulge , the bar , the spheroid , the thin disk , the thick disk , and the cold interstellar medium in the disk .",
    "it is somewhat problematic to determine where a component starts and ends , and this invariably adds to confusion of terminology .",
    "for example , the bar sits in the overlap region between the bulge and the disk , and most stars in this region rotate in the same sense with similar angular speed .",
    "so is the bar a distinct identity on top of an oblate bulge , is it merely the triaxial bulge , or is it the non - axisymmetric part of the disk inside corotation ?",
    "the lack of a 3d map of the milky way makes it uncertain whether or not the disk is truncated inside the corotation of the bar .",
    "these distinctions are subjective at some level and sometimes unnecessary when the important quantity is the total mass distribution of the baryons .",
    "we take a different approach .",
    "we divide up the mass of the galaxy into only two components : a dark halo component and a summed - up baryonic component .",
    "we describe this baryonic sum by a function @xmath15 , which is the combined mass of baryons inside the radius @xmath16 .",
    "it is understood that the mass distribution is far from spherical .",
    "in fact it is highly flattened , and triaxial inside @xmath17 kpc .",
    "we incorporate some minimal modeling of the dynamical effects of flattening and triaxiality , but without repeating earlier more rigorous 3-dimensional triaxial dynamical models @xcite .",
    "our models for the bulge / bar are motivated by the @xcite model of the galactic bulge / bar .",
    "that model used cobe dirbe de - reddened infrared maps @xcite and a collection of stellar kinematics data in the direction of the central parts of the galactic bulge .",
    "the fit to the data indicated that the bar has an elongated boxy triaxial shape .",
    "@xcite added a steep oblate nucleus to the best - fit so - called `` g2 '' model of @xcite .",
    "the nucleus and a massive central black hole are important for modeling the compressed density of the dark matter within 100 pc .",
    "the total mass of the bulge , the bar , and the nucleus was @xmath18 .",
    "no dark matter was explicitly included in the model of @xcite .",
    "a massive miyamo - nagai analytic disk potential was used to make the rotation curve flat within 8 kpc . here , instead of the miyamo - nagai disk",
    ", we use a double - exponential disk as in @xcite .",
    "the combined density of nucleus , bulge / bar , and disk are modeled by the following three components : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are characteristic densities , determined by the corresponding total masses @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 of the components @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the dimensionless radii @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are given by @xmath32 ^ 2 + z^4 \\over z_0 ^ 4},\\\\ s_3      & = & { \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}+12 |z| \\over r_d}. \\label{eq : bulge}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above aspect ratios in the components @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are taken from @xcite to reproduce the shape of the cobe bar and the disk of @xcite .",
    "we take the vertical scale height @xmath36 from @xcite , and take the disk scale - length to be @xmath37 or @xmath38  pc , and the distance to the galactic center to be @xmath39 or @xmath40  pc .",
    "these parameter combinations produce acceptable fits to the light distribution of the milky way after proper normalization of the three components .",
    "@xcite normalizes the @xmath26 and @xmath27 components so that they have equal strength at about a distance @xmath41 on the minor axis .",
    "this fixes the ratio @xmath42 so that @xmath43 joins smoothly from an observed power - law nucleus to the observed cobe bar .",
    "the ratio @xmath44 is fixed so that @xmath45 , approximately matching the bulge - to - disk k - band luminosity ratio @xmath46 of @xcite .",
    "kent et al .",
    "in fact introduced a linear tapering of their disk scale length from 250 pc at the solar radius to 167 pc at the center for better matching of the observed surface brightness map .",
    "this makes their disk less massive than our double - exponential disk if both are normalized to the surface density and the volume density at the solar radius .",
    "the same is true of the triaxial models of @xcite , where the axisymmetric disk is tailored into a triaxial hole inside 3.5 kpc .",
    "we do not introduce this fine tailoring of the disk , instead favoring the mathematical simplicity of a @xmath27 bar and a @xmath28 disk , rather than a true bar or disk .",
    "the extra mass contained in our @xmath27 disk is at the price of reducing the mass of our @xmath28 bar given the same budget of mass or light within the central 3.5 kpc .",
    "we have deliberately chosen not to label the three components @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 as nucleus , bar and disk given the uncertain truncations of these latter components .",
    "instead they should be treated as convenient functions to describe the overall distribution of baryons .",
    "there is no separate thick disk component . when computing the rotation curve we approximate @xmath28 as a razor - thin disk , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 as spherical .",
    "the enclosed baryonic mass is computed by spherically averaging @xmath47 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 a more user - friendly analytic approximation of @xmath50 is : @xmath51 + \\nonumber \\\\             & m_2 \\left [ { \\rm erf}\\left({x_2 \\over \\sqrt{2}}\\right ) -",

    "we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : mb])in our calculations . the total mass of the galaxy inside a radius @xmath16 is computed as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the mass profile of the dark matter .",
    "we include a central black hole of mass @xmath58 in the milky way models and @xmath59 in the m31 models .    in our milky way models",
    "the parameters of the bulge are kept close to those of the original @xcite bulge .",
    "this is done to preserve the agreement with the cobe data and with estimates of stellar radial velocities .",
    "another reason is the microlensing counts , which may be a problem for models of the milky way @xcite .",
    "the rate of microlensing events was estimated for the @xcite bulge and was found to be consistent with the constraints on the counts @xcite .      a sparse set of observational data",
    "can generally be fit by a large range of models , and sometimes unphysical models give excellent fits .",
    "@xcite give plenty of examples of this kind . to obtain physically interesting models , it is important to impose constraints based on a physical theory of halo formation , and to select models which are not only compatible with data but are also physically well - motivated . in this paper",
    "we use three results from halo formation theory : the shape of the mass density profile , the halo concentration - mass relationship , and the distribution of halo spin parameter ( angular momentum ) .    throughout this paper , we assume that the hubble constant is equal to @xmath60 , the universe is flat and the contribution of matter ( dark and baryonic ) to the critical density is equal to @xmath61 . we assume that initially the dark matter density profile is described by an nfw profile (",
    "* nfw ) : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the halo concentration and virial mass , and @xmath65 is the virial radius . in the above equations , the parameter @xmath66 is the critical density of the universe and @xmath67 is the overdensity of a collapsed object in the `` top - hat '' collapse model ( @xmath68 for our cosmological model ) . two independent parameters  @xmath63 and @xmath64  completely define all relevant halo properties .    for some halos the central slope may be even steeper ( -1.5 ) than the -1 slope in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nfwa ] ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for radii larger than 0.5 - 1% of the virial radius ( 1 - 3  kpc for our galaxies ) the difference between this profile and eq .",
    "( [ eq : nfwa ] ) is relatively small @xcite .",
    "baryonic infall has a tendency to reduce this difference even more , as we will discuss in section  [ sec : compression ] . because the baryonic compression is very large and still quite uncertain and because of the relatively small differences in the density profiles",
    ", we will not consider profiles with a steeper -1.5 inner slope here .",
    "while we have introduced the halo concentration @xmath63 as an independent parameter , in practice it is found to be strongly correlated with the virial mass @xcite .",
    "for the  model , @xcite give @xmath69 .",
    "statistical ensembles of halos at fixed mass show 40% rms fluctuations of the concentration around this mean . for @xmath6 halos",
    "this gives a range of @xmath70 .",
    "halos of this mass may host galaxies of all types , not only the sb galaxies considered in this paper .",
    "one may argue that perhaps ellipticals , lenticulars , and sa s form in high concentration halos and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies are hosted by low concentration halos .",
    "thus , the range for `` normal '' sb galaxies may be somewhat narrower than the full spread for all halos .",
    "tentatively , we assume that the concentration should be in the range @xmath71 .    the angular momentum of dark matter halos is also theoretically constrained .",
    "halos in cosmological simulations have small amounts of angular momentum , characterized by the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the angular momentum and @xmath74 is the total energy of the halo .",
    "the spin parameter has a log - normal distribution , which does not depend ( or has very little dependence ) on cosmological parameters , halo mass , or redshift @xcite .",
    "we use the parameters given by @xcite .",
    "the maximum of the distribution of @xmath75 is at @xmath76 and @xmath75 has a 90% probability of being in the range @xmath77 just as in the case of the concentration , it is likely that there is a correlation of morphological type and spin , with sb galaxies avoiding halos with both extremely low and high values of @xmath75 .    for each set of model assumptions",
    ", we can estimate the spin parameter of its pre - collapse halo .",
    "after the fitting is done and we have the rotation curve , we find the angular momentum of the disk : @xmath78@xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the surface density of the disk .",
    "we then assume that the specific angular momentum of the whole system @xmath81 is equal to the specific angular momentum of the present - day disk @xmath82 .",
    "this gives us the total angular momentum @xmath73 .",
    "using the parameters of the pre - collapse halo we estimate the potential energy of the system and , assuming virial equilibrium , find the spin parameter .",
    "the assumption of virial equilibrium should be quite reasonable because our systems are not interacting or merging .",
    "the assumption that @xmath83 is a sensible and conventional starting point , and should require little further discussion .",
    "we neglect the angular momentum of the bulge in our calculations . this does not give large errors because the angular momentum of bulges in our models is much smaller that the angular momentum of disks . because we restrict our modelling to late type galaxies , bulge masses are also small ( @xmath84% of the disk mass )",
    ", so in the worst case we are making 20% error .",
    "the original angular momentum of the dark matter halo comes from gravitational ( tidal ) interactions with its environment .",
    "thus , the dark matter and the gas experience the same torque in the process of halo assembly and should initially have ( almost ) the same specific angular momentum .",
    "the main uncertainty is what happens to the gas and its angular momentum from the moment it crosses the virial radius until it finally settles into the disk .",
    "as we shall find , a significant fraction of the gas must not end up in the disk . in our models ,",
    "about half of the gas is not found in the disk or bulge .",
    "the models presented here do not address the question of where that gas is ; whether it is still inside the virial radius , was expelled from the halo or was never in the halo . for simplicity , we assume that the specific angular momentum was not affected by whatever processes ( presumably some form of feedback ) were responsible for removing the gas from the disk or preventing its collapse . another issue is the exchange of angular momentum between the baryons and the dark matter .",
    "some redistribution of the angular momentum may have happened , but we do not know how significant it was .",
    "we consider two types of models , with and without exchange of angular momentum . in both cases , within a specific set of assumptions about the angular momentum exchange ( or lack thereof ) , we can thus find the initial angular momentum of the gas which is presently in the disk .",
    "we start with models with no exchange of angular momentum between different components .",
    "the effects of baryonic infall are treated following same approach as that of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the compression occurs adiabatically and the angular momentum of each component is preserved as the baryons settle into the exponential disk .",
    "assuming additionally that the velocity anisotropy is preserved , one obtains the following relation : @xmath85 r = g m_{\\rm halo}(r_i)r_i,~ \\label{eq : adiabat1}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the specific angular momentum , @xmath87 is the average radius of a dark matter particle before the baryonic compression , @xmath50 and @xmath88 are the baryonic mass and dark matter mass inside the final radius @xmath16 and the @xmath89 is the halo mass before contraction , given by @xmath90 equation ( [ eq : adiabat1 ] ) can be considered as an equation for the initial radius @xmath87 corresponding to a given final radius @xmath16 .",
    "this equation is solved numerically .",
    "models with exchange of angular momentum between the baryons and dark matter are more complicated .",
    "the exchange probably happens at late stages of the baryonic infall when the baryon density becomes large and a non - axisymmetric component may develop due to the excitation of spiral waves and/or bar - like modes .",
    "giant molecular clouds may play some role in this process .",
    "dynamical friction can then result in a transfer of angular momentum from the baryons to the dark matter . because the dark matter gains angular momentum , it moves further from the galactic center .",
    "thus , the density of the dark matter in the central region decreases . in the early stages of galaxy formation ,",
    "when most of the baryons were still in gaseous form , we might expect that those non - axisymmetric features were more prevalent and more dynamically important then at the present time when most of the baryons are locked in stars .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the exact amount of angular momentum that would be lost by the baryons in such a situation , but we know that it can not be very large .",
    "it is constrained by two factors : the angular momentum of the disk at present , and the condition that the initial spin parameter should be close to the typical ( median ) value for halos .",
    "models without the exchange of angular momentum give @xmath91 , which is already close to the most probable spin @xmath76 of a dark matter halo .",
    "if the disk loses some angular momentum during its assembly , the estimate of the initial spin parameter increases almost linearly with the lost angular momentum .",
    "if too much angular momentum is lost , the spin parameter becomes unacceptably large and we would be forced to conclude that our galaxy formed from the extreme tail of the distribution .",
    "still , because the distribution of spin parameter is quite broad , there is some room for angular momentum exchange .",
    "the spin parameter can be two times larger than for the no - exchange models and still be considered `` typical '' .",
    "thus for our model with angular momentum exchange , we assume that the disk loses a factor of 1.52 of its angular momentum during the collapse . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the formation of the disk happens in two stages . during the first stage , when the baryons experience most of the collapse , they preserve their angular momentum . during the second stage the disk shrinks further , losing some of its angular momentum to the dark matter .",
    "we use the approach outlined in the previous section to compute the state of the system at the end of the first stage of adiabatic compression ( in which angular momentum is conserved ) .",

    "\\label{eq : difangulara}\\ ] ] this angular momentum is deposited into the dark matter , which produced the dynamical friction .",
    "thus , the final angular momentum of the dm shell is @xmath100    shells at different distances should be affected because the dynamical friction is not a local process . nevertheless , for simplicity",
    ", we deposit all the angular momentum into the shell through which the disk or bulge element moves .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation because ( i ) a significant fraction of the dynamical friction is due to the elements of dark matter closest to the sinking baryonic material , and ( ii ) the volume affected by the deposition of the angular momentum for all shells is very extended  up to 20  kpc .",

    "( [ eq : exchangeangulara ] ) takes the form : @xmath110 it is clear that during the initial stages of the collapse , when the density of the baryons was about ten times smaller than the density of the dark matter , the exchange of angular momentum had little impact on the dark matter : @xmath111 .",
    "the effect peaks at around @xmath112 . at even larger values of the density ratio",
    ", the approximation fails because a small amount of dark matter can not exert significant dynamical friction on large mass of baryons .",
    "nevertheless , at the peak of its importance , the effect is potentially quite large , with @xmath113 , resulting in a decrease of the dark matter density by a factor of ten .",

    "the problem is that we can not exclude the possibility that small @xmath229 disturbances related to the bar can be felt even at larger radii .",

    "for this reason , we still consider the fit produced by model @xmath223 to be acceptable in spite of the fact that for longitudes @xmath230 the model values exceed the observational points by @xmath229 .",
    "figure [ fig : rotmodela ] shows the rotation curve of our galaxy .",

    "the following observational constraints are used .",
    "the first two points at 5 - 10  pc are from studies of stellar radial velocities and proper motions in the galactic center .",
    "squares are based on kinematics of oh / ir stars @xcite .",
    "the point at 3.5  kpc is based on the @xcite model of the bar . because the model was compared with the data on stellar kinematics ( inner rotation curve and radial velocity dispersion )",
    ", it gives a constraint on the total mass : @xmath231 , with an uncertainty of about 20% .",
    "for the next data point at 8.5  kpc we simply assume that the circular velocity is @xmath232 , which covers the whole range of reasonable values .",
    "we then estimate the mass as @xmath233 .",
    "the last observational point is the constraint from the motions of satellite galaxies discussed in section [ sec : obsconstraints ] .",
    "the central data points were not used in either our fitting or in the analysis of the bulge @xcite . nevertheless , they come fairly close to the extrapolation of our model into the very center of our galaxy .",
    "the theoretical curves for our favored models @xmath223 and @xmath224 are very close to each other , which is not surprising because they fit the same data and have the same global dark matter content .",
    "the largest deviation of the models from the data is for the mass inside 100  pc , where the observational estimate is twice larger than the prediction of the models . even at this point",
    "the disagreement is not alarming because the observational data are likely more uncertain than the formal error .",
    "what is remarkable about figure [ fig : massmw ] is that it spans more than 5 orders of magnitude in radius and mass .",
    "it is encouraging that , without fine - tuning , our models are consistent with observations of the dynamical mass of the mw over this huge range .    finding",
    "an acceptable model for m31 was relatively easy because there are much less data .",
    "in particular , we do not have kinematic constraints for the disk , which would be equivalent to constraints at the solar position in our galaxy .",
    "our model seems to reproduce reasonably well the dynamical mass of m31 from 100  pc to @xmath225100  kpc .",
    "our model does not produce the very large wiggles exhibited by the observed rotation curve .",
    "the wiggles at 5  kpc and 9  kpc are likely due to non - circular motions induced by the bar and , thus , as discussed before , can not be reproduced by any axisymmetric model .",
    "the bulge of m31 is almost twice as massive as the bulge of our galaxy .",
    "it is also slightly ( 30% ) more compact .",
    "the disk of m31 is also more massive , but it is more extended . as a result ,",
    "in the central 5  kpc of the m31 the bulge is a much more dominant component as compared with the bulge of our galaxy .    the surface brightness profile in the r - band , shown in figure  [ fig : brightnessm31 ] ,",
    "is used as an additional constraint .",
    "an accurate fit ( the same as for the mass modeling ) is obtained for stellar mass - to - light ratios of @xmath234 and @xmath235 for the disk and the bulge respectively .",
    "these results are quite consistent with the expectations from stellar population synthesis models for a galaxy with the @xmath236 color of m31 , which imply an overall stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath237 @xcite .",
    "the bulge @xmath238 is likely overestimated , and would be reduced by a correction for internal dust absorption .",
    "for example , internal absorption of 0.25  mag inside the bulge would reduce @xmath238 to 2.4 . at a first glance our estimates of the m / l ratios are significantly different from those of @xcite , who give @xmath239 and @xmath240 for the bulge and the disk .",
    "most of the differences come from differences in bands ( @xmath16 instead of r ) and from the fact that kent s luminosities were not corrected for absorption .",
    "if we include those corrections ( see section  [ sec : obsm31 ] ) and also scale the results to the distance of 770  pc , kent s estimates become @xmath241 for the disk ( @xmath242 in b ) and @xmath243 for the bulge .",
    "such a large m / l ratio for the disk , more typical of an old bulge population , seems a bit problematic .",
    "the main reason why @xcite has such a large",
    "m / l lies in the assumed profile of the dark matter : constant density through the whole galaxy .",
    "this results in the extreme case of a maximal disk , and very little dark matter inside 20 - 25  kpc .",
    "the sinking of baryons into the central part of a galaxy increases the depth of the gravitational potential .",
    "this leads to an increase of the dark matter density . to some degree",
    ", this process provides coupling of the baryons and the dark matter . as a result",
    ", in the case of adiabatic compression without the exchange of the angular momentum , it appears difficult to find a case where one of the components ( dark matter or baryons ) is significantly larger than the other .",
    "figure   [ fig : rotmodela ] , top panel , gives an example of this effect . from 100  pc to about 6  kpc the contributions of baryons and dark matter to the circular velocity are about equal .",
    "we use two simple models to study the effect of adiabatic compression on the ratio of dark matter and baryons . in the first case we take model @xmath223 and change the mass of baryons while keeping the disk scale length and the bulge - to - disk ratio constant . in the second case , we vary the scale length of the disk , keeping the mass of the disk the same as in model @xmath223 ; we ignore the bulge to make the case more clear .",
    "figure [ fig : compression ] shows the ratio of the circular velocity produced by the dark matter to that of the baryons .",
    "figure [ fig : compression ] illustrates that for a realistic range of parameters the contribution of baryons can not be significantly larger that of the dark matter . even in the case when disk is four times more massive or four times more compact than in model @xmath223 , the contribution of the dark matter to the rotation curve was at least 1/3 .",
    "in other words , in hierarchical models with adiabatic compression and no exchange between components it is difficult to have a maximum disk .",
    "it is interesting to note that the opposite is also true : in the central part of a galaxy it is difficult to have a model where the mass of the dark matter is much larger than that of baryons .",
    "the model with a four times more extended disk in the top panel ( @xmath244 ) is an example of what should represent a low surface brightness galaxy .",
    "its surface density is 16 times smaller than for our galaxy , and its mass in stars is only 1% of the virial mass , yet the baryons at the solar radius contribute about 1/4 of the rotational velocity .    in view of this self - adjusting behavior of the dark matter ,",
    "it is easier to understand the profiles of different components in realistic models .",
    "the top panel in figure  [ fig : density ] shows the dark matter and the combined disk and bulge density profiles . for comparison",
    "we also show the dark matter profile before the baryonic infall .",
    "note that the change in the dark matter profile is quite large , yet the final profile manages to follow the baryonic density very closely in the central region .",
    "the bottom panel shows different components for model @xmath224 .",
    "each component has a complicated shape .",
    "different components become prominent at different radii .",
    "the net effect is rather remarkable  the sum of all components is very close to a power - law with slope -2 .",
    "the deviations from this power law are less than 10% on scales of 120  kpc .",
    "one may argue that this occurs because we are fitting a rotation curve that is nearly flat , and so we get a @xmath157 density profile .",
    "this is not exactly true .",
    "the observed deviations are quite substantial .",
    "the final fit is much closer to a pure power law than what is required by the observations .",
    "this `` disk - halo conspiracy '' is the natural result of the coupling of baryons and dark matter via the adiabatic compression .",
    "if the luminosity of our galaxy is typical of that of other disk - type galaxies that form in halos of the same mass , this also has implications for the global luminosity function .",
    "we now investigate the number density of galaxies like the milky way , using the revised press - schechter approximation of @xcite .",
    "the sheth - tormen approximation provides us with the number density of dark matter halos as a function of their mass .",
    "once we have pinned down the luminosity of the milky way , we can calculate the mass - to - light ratio within the virial radius of the dark matter halo hosting the galaxy in a given model .",
    "we can then convert the halo number density per mass interval to a galaxy number density per magnitude interval , which may be compared with the observed luminosity function .",
    "we neglect the contribution from galaxies that are `` satellites '' in much larger mass halos ( i.e. , cluster galaxies ) , and assume that the adopted mass - to - light ratio holds for disk galaxies only .",
    "we then compare this prediction with the k - band luminosity function for all galaxies and for late - type galaxies from the 2mass survey @xcite .",
    "we use two different approaches to estimate the k - band luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "the total luminosity of our galaxy is notoriously difficult to measure directly because we live in the middle of it , and obscuration is important even in the k - band .",
    "@xcite recently performed a detailed analysis in which they estimated the k - band luminosity of the milky way by fitting a model to the cobe dirbe photometric data .",
    "they found @xmath143 for the total luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "the other approach is to assume that the galaxy is `` typical '' and should lie on the tully - fisher relation ( tfr ) .",
    "unfortunately , this approach is also uncertain because there is little tully - fisher data in the k - band and the results in the literature are somewhat inconsistent .",
    "if we use the tfr of @xcite , assuming that the velocity width of the milky way @xmath245 km / s , then we obtain @xmath246 , about 0.7 magnitudes fainter than the direct dirbe measurement . if we use instead @xmath247 km / s , which malhotra et al . obtain by scaling from m31 ( @xmath248 , with @xmath249 ) , then we get @xmath250 , only 0.3 magnitudes fainter than the direct measurement .",
    "this would place the mw about 1-@xmath153 brightwards of the tfr , which seems not unreasonable .",
    "however , the k-band tfr recently published by @xcite and @xcite gives @xmath251 for @xmath252 km / s .",
    "the slope is very similar to the relation of malhotra et al . , but the zero - point is almost one full magnitude brighter .",
    "this problem is only exacerbated if we consider that the cepheid calibration data used by malhotra et al .",
    "is consistent with a hubble parameter of @xmath253 km / s / mpc , while the ground - based @xmath254 data imply @xmath255 km / s / mpc .",
    "if we scale the zero - point of the ground - based data to the lower value of @xmath256 km / s / mpc , all the galaxies are further away and therefore are even brighter , making the discrepancy worse ( the milky way would then have @xmath257 ) .",
    "@xcite base their tfr on photometry from dirbe and have a total of seven galaxies in their sample ( including the milky way ) .",
    "the ground - based k-band sample considered by @xcite and @xcite are from the ursa major sample ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and additional galaxies from the pisces filament , and consists of a total of 69 galaxies with 4 galaxies having cepheid distances . all of these galaxies have multi - band photometry in b , r , i and k and the tf relations in the optical bands agree well with those from other samples , including the very well - studied i - band .",
    "therefore it seems that the zero - point for the ground - based sample should be more reliable .",
    "this suggests that perhaps there is some sort of calibration offset in the dirbe photometry , and perhaps calls into question the validity of using even the @xcite result .",
    "we shall consider the implications of using three different choices for the total k - band luminosity of the galaxy : the direct dirbe result , the raw ground - based tfr result , and the ground - based tfr result scaled to @xmath258 km / s / mpc .",
    "the three sets of squares plotted in figure  [ fig : lfnorm ] correspond to these three values .    in each case",
    "the higher of the two connected squares shows the number density that we would obtain if every halo hosted a disk galaxy .",
    "the lower point shows the value obtained if only half of the halos host disk - type galaxies ( probably a reasonable lower limit , based on semi - analytic modelling ) .",
    "the points can easily be scaled up or down for different assumptions about the fraction of disk - hosting halos , but for reasonable assumptions the result should lie between the lower and upper points .",
    "unfortunately , the interpretation of the luminosity function constraint is quite sensitive to the uncertain value of the mw s total luminosity . for",
    "the bright normalization ( from the tfr of @xcite scaled to @xmath258 km / s / mpc ) , the number density of halos harboring mw galaxies is about a factor of two higher than the observations . for the faint normalization ( the direct value from * ? ? ? * ) , the number density of mw halos is marginally consistent with the observed luminosity function .",
    "it is of some concern that for the milky way normalization that we regard as the most reliable ( the ground - based tfr scaled to the standard value of @xmath259 ) , the luminosity function constraint is violated .",
    "if this normalization turns out to be correct , then this may suggest that the milky way is harbored by a halo with a larger virial mass .",
    "the number density of dark matter halos drops fairly rapidly with virial mass so this relaxes the constraint somewhat .",
    "figure  [ fig : mwmass ] shows the number density of dark matter halos as a function of their virial mass , normalized by the observed number density of galaxies at the assumed luminosity of the milky way from @xcite .",
    "we see that the faint and even the intermediate milky way luminosity can be accomodated fairly comfortably within the mass range allowed by our dynamical modeling ( @xmath260 ; with brighter milky ways favoring larger virial masses ) , however , the bright milky way normalization is too high even at the upper virial mass limit of @xmath261 .",
    "there are numerous aspects of these models of the mw and the m31 galaxies which are important to consider .",
    "we start with very small scales and proceed to larger ones .",
    "it is now quite well established that black holes of mass @xmath262 reside in the centers of most galaxies . the case for a @xmath263 black hole at the center of the milky way is demanded by rising radial velocity and proper motion dispersions within a few pc of the center ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that if the bh is grown adiabatically , the central dark matter will be drawn into a dense spike , with density exceeding @xmath264 .",
    "this would make the galactic center very luminous in terms of neutrino flux if the dark matter is made of annihilating neutralinos .",
    "@xcite however argue that it is unlikely for the bh to grow all its mass while at rest in the center because of galaxy merging in cdm models . a spiraling - in bh would actually `` heat '' and reduce the central density of the dark matter .",
    "the seed is likely to be massive ( @xmath265 ) , because otherwise it would not have enough time to spiral into the center by dynamical friction .",
    "realistic models of loss - cone capture show that the rate of stellar capture is around @xmath266 per hubble time @xcite .",
    "this implies that the bh could at most double its mass during the adiabatic phase .",
    "following @xcite we take into account the effect of adiabatic growth from a seed bh of half the final value .",
    "the flux is very likely to be small because in our models the final peak of the dark matter density outside the event horizon of the bh is well below @xmath267 , which is the amount needed for significant annihilation .",
    "microlensing events toward the galactic center provide a lower limit on the mass of baryons within the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "combined with the observed terminal velocities , this places upper limits on the mass of dark matter that can be present and implies that the inner galaxy must be mostly baryonic with a massive bulge and disk .",
    "the microlensing events toward the galactic bulge are still not completely understood observationally and theoretically , in particular the nature of two long - duration events near the @xmath268 , @xmath269 field .",
    "several values for the spatially averaged optical depth are reported with large discrepancies in the mean values .",
    "the earlier values are too high for axisymmetric bulge and disk models , and are barely consistent even with a massive bar .",
    "a @xmath270 bar pointing about @xmath271 away from the galactic center - sun line plus a full disk with a mass of @xmath272 inside 3.5 kpc are required by detailed dynamical models of the cobe map and by the kinematics of the bulge stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the bulk of the lenses are on the near side of this elongated bar .",
    "this bar plus disk model can produce an optical depth consistent with the lower @xmath273 error bar of the observed microlensing optical depth of @xmath274 for all stars observed by ogle @xcite toward baade s window ( @xmath275 and @xmath276 ) .",
    "@xcite found that this model with a flat imf with very few brown dwarfs can fit the microlensing event duration distribution .",
    "@xcite studied the optical depth and the distribution of durations of lensing events for the bulge with the shape used in our paper .",
    "both statistics were found to be compatible with observational data .",
    "@xcite pointed out that except for very contrived models , the higher reported optical depth values are in conflict with the total lensable material in the inner galaxy .",
    "the optical depth for the low - latitude red clump subsample from macho @xcite is between @xmath277 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "this would require contrived models involving the sun - center line being the diagonal line of a homogeneous rectangular bar .",
    "this discrepancy has been highlighted by @xcite and by @xcite for axisymmetric models .",
    "both confirmed that the need of extremely contrived bar and disc models if the optical depth is as large as @xmath277 .",
    "the most recent analysis of bulge microlensing , however , suggests a lower optical depth in general .",
    "statistics have improved as we now have over 500 events . in particular , the value for red clump giants is the range @xmath278 depending on whether the long duration events are included ( popowski 2001 , private communications ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the 3 kpc arm might correspond to a stellar ring , and also account for a large fraction of the microlenses .    without making detailed models of the non - axisymmetric bar and the ring ,",
    "we can do a quick check of whether our models are consistent with the microlensing data by scaling the results of @xcite and @xcite for the masses of baryonic components in our models .",
    "if we use only the @xmath27 bar component ( mass @xmath279 ) , then the optical depth is @xmath280 @xcite . in our model @xmath223",
    "there is another @xmath281 of baryons inside 3.5  kpc which is formally in the @xmath28 axisymmetric disk . as we have discussed",
    ", this thin unperturbed disk inside the non - axisymmetric bar is only a mathematical simplification .",
    "it is unlikely that it can stay thin or even can survive inside the bar .",
    "the most probable scenario is that the bar was formed from the disk at some epoch , when the disk became unstable . in this case",
    "the disk becomes the bar and we should expect that the inner disk has the same distribution as the bar . in this case",
    ", the microlensing counts should include all the baryonic mass inside 3.5  kpc , which doubles the estimate of the optical depth",
    ". then our best models @xmath223 and @xmath224 are consistent with an optical depth of @xmath282 .",
    "our estimate for the virial mass of the m31 halo @xmath283 is consistent with earlier estimates which used kinematics of satellites .",
    "@xcite found a total mass of @xmath284 inside @xmath285 , and @xcite and @xcite found @xmath286 .",
    "the main difference between our results and @xcite is that they assumed a halo density profile very different from an nfw profile .    for the milky way halo ,",
    "our models @xmath223 and @xmath224 predict a mass @xmath287 , consistent with what @xcite find in their `` standard models 1 - 4 '' , @xmath288 .",
    "our disk also has a mass of @xmath289 , consistent with their finding of @xmath290 .",
    "our results and conclusions differ from those of @xcite , who model the milky way in the framework of a cosmological scenario .",
    "@xcite find that the standard halo profiles are not compatible with the observed properties of the milky way and that `` the rotation curve for our galaxy implies the presence of a constant density core in its dark matter halo '' .",
    "the gross features of our approach and that of @xcite are similar .",
    "the parameters of the cosmological models are only slightly different .",
    "adiabatic infall corrections are also used , and the dark matter profiles are also similar .",
    "the main difference was in the mass of the halo assumed for the galaxy .",
    "the average virial mass in the models of @xcite was assumed to be @xmath291 , which is almost three times larger than the virial mass in our favored models @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "if we ran our models for this large virial mass , we would also reject the model ( our model @xmath292 has the largest virial mass , @xmath293 , and even this model is marginal , with a rather large rotation velocity and an abnormally low concentration ) .",
    "the reason that @xcite adopted such a large virial mass is their perhaps overly stringent interpretation of the @xcite estimate of the mass inside 50  kpc .",
    "@xcite assume that the mass was @xmath294 , while @xcite gives @xmath295 at the 90% confidence level if leo i is excluded from the analysis . for comparison , our models @xmath223 and @xmath224 have @xmath296 , which is compatible with @xcite .",
    "@xcite give even larger uncertainties on the mass : @xmath297 .",
    "there is no doubt that estimates of the mass at large radii , 50  kpc ",
    "100  kpc , are crucial for constraining the halo parameters .",
    "values of @xmath298 larger than @xmath299 are very likely to be difficult to reconcile with the standard cosmological models .",
    "the problem is that the observational constraints are still very much uncertain .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with the results of @xcite , who came to the conclusion that `` cuspy haloes favored by the cold dark matter cosmology ( and its variants ) are inconsistent with the observational data '' .",
    "their main argument was a combination of three constraints .",
    "( 1 ) the mass of baryonic matter in the disk and bulge inside the solar radius should be larger than @xmath300 to produce enough microlensing events .",
    "( 2 ) the surface density of the dark matter inside 1.1  kpc from the plane at the solar radius should be @xmath301 to satisfy the constraints from local steller kinematics and stellar and gas content .",
    "( 3 ) the sum of all components should reproduce the circular velocity curve at 24  kpc .",
    "our models @xmath223 and @xmath224 easily satisfy the first two constraints . for example , there is a mass of @xmath302 of baryons inside the solar radius in our model @xmath223 , and the dark matter surface density is @xmath303 . in our modeling",
    "we do not use the circular velocity at 24  kpc because corrections due to non - circular motions are large and uncertain . still , even if we accept the binney & evans results for the circular velocity , the differences appear to be small ",
    "10   for 24  kpc , which is within the observational uncertainty .",
    "we also note that that the treatment of the dark matter and the bar by binney & evans are not realistic .",
    "the profile of the dark matter was assumed to be unmodified nfw , which as we have discussed is not appropriate for the inner part of our galaxy where adiabatic compression will have substantially modified the dark matter profile .",
    "the bulge was modeled as an elliptical exponential disk with scale - length 1  kpc .",
    "we have used more realistic models for the dark matter and a more detailed bar model which matches numerous observational constraints .",
    "we also rely on the more detailed treatment of lensing events made by @xcite and by @xcite for the same bar used in our analysis .",
    "these differences explain why we come to different conclusions .",
    "we study models of the milky way and the andromeda galaxies based on the standard paradigm of disk and dark matter halo formation within a  cosmology .",
    "the models produced acceptable fits for numerous observational data . here we itemize our main conclusions .",
    "\\(ii ) the compression of the dark matter by baryons is a very significant effect in the inner parts of galaxies , and must be taken into account .",
    "it provides a coupling between the baryons and the dark matter .",
    "the result of this coupling is that the total density distribution does not show any wiggles or features corresponding to the transition from one component to another .",
    "thus , the disk - halo `` conspiracy '' is a natural prediction of our models .",
    "\\(iii ) the rate of microlensing events is a strong constraining factor for models with standard cuspy halo density profiles .",
    "these models are compatible with the recent low estimates of the optical depth if all the stellar material inside 3.5  kpc is optimally distributed in a @xmath304 bar .",
    "\\(iv ) in none of our models does the dark matter dominate the central parts ( @xmath305 ) of the galaxies . since both the mw and m31 appear to be typical high surface brightness galaxies ( hsb )",
    ", we expect that this is true for other hsb galaxies . if there has been no transfer of angular momentum between the baryons and the dark matter , hsb galaxies should have sub - maximal disks .",
    "\\(v ) including the effects of a modest transfer of angular momentum from baryons to dark matter ( expected during the non - axisymmetric process of bar formation ) can produce models with 23 times less dark matter in the central @xmath306 region of the galaxy .",
    "this is likely to allow sustanance of fast rotating bars such as those observed in the milky way and m31 .",
    "these models also allow a slightly heavier disk without producing too high a rotation curve .",
    "\\(vi ) our dynamical models suggest that the virial mass of the dark matter halo hosting the milky way and m31 is in the range @xmath307 .",
    "we use the predicted halo mass function to estimate the number density of such halos and compare this with the observed number density of galaxies .",
    "we find that if the k - band luminosity of the milky way is @xmath308 , as found by @xcite based on direct fits to dirbe data , then the predicted number density of dark matter halos hosting milky way galaxies is not inconsistent with the observed k - band luminosity function of @xcite . if the milky way has a larger luminosity of @xmath251 to @xmath309 , as would be the case if it lies on the tully fisher relation found by @xcite and @xcite , then the number density of `` milky way '' halos is more than a factor of two higher than the observed number density of galaxies at this luminosity .",
    "increasing the virial mass of the milky way s halo to the upper limit allowed by the dynamical modelling ( @xmath310 ) allows the fainter end of the tf range to be accomodated , but not the brightest values .",
    "\\(vii ) a significant fraction of the baryons within the virial radius of the halo must not be in the disk or bulge of the milky way and m31 .",
    "all acceptable models required that the disk and bulge should contain not more than @xmath2251/4 - 1/2 of the baryons expected to be inside the virial radius of the halo in the absence of feedback .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to address the state and the location of the `` lost '' baryons , but this is in keeping with the usual assumptions of semi - analytic models , and we address this issue in paper ii .",
    "we note that this conclusion is based on two independent arguments .",
    "models which have more than half of the baryons in the central luminous part fail to produce acceptable fits for either the rotation curve or for the local surface density .",
    "when compared with the observed luminosity function , these models also produce too large a number density of bright galaxies ( see ( vi ) above ) .",
    "this is related to the usual `` over - cooling '' problem ( see @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",

    "<S> we apply standard disk formation theory with adiabatic contraction within cuspy halo models predicted by the standard cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting models are confronted with the broad range of observational data available for the milky way and m31 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is a narrow range of parameters which can satisfy the observational constraints , but within this range , the models score remarkably well . </S>",
    "<S> our favored models have virial masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the galaxy and for m31 respectively , average spin parameters @xmath2 , and concentrations @xmath3 , typical for halos of this mass in the standard  cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> the models require neither dark matter modifications nor flat cores to fit the observational data . </S>",
    "<S> we explore two types of models , with and without the exchange of angular momentum between the dark matter and the baryons . </S>",
    "<S> the models without exchange give reasonable rotation curves , fulfill constraints in the solar neighborhood , and satisfy constraints at larger radii , but they may be problematic for fast rotating central bars . </S>",
    "<S> we explore models in which the baryons experience additional contraction due to loss of angular momentum to the surrounding dark matter ( perhaps via a bar - like mode ) . </S>",
    "<S> these models produce similar global properties , but the dark matter is only a fourth of the total mass in the central 3  kpc region , allowing a fast rotating bar to persist . according to preliminary calculations , our model galaxies probably have sufficient baryonic mass in the central @xmath4 kpc to reproduce recent observational values of the optical depth to microlensing events towards the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> our dynamical models unequivocally require that about half of all the gas inside the virial radius must not be in the disk or in the bulge , a result that is obtained naturally in standard semi - analytic models . assuming that the milky way is `` typical '' , we investigate whether the range of virial masses allowed by our dynamical models is compatible with constraints from the galaxy luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> we find that if the milky way has a luminosity @xmath5 , then these constraints are satisfied , but if it is more luminous ( as expected if it lies on the tully - fisher relation ) , then the predicted space density is larger than the observed space density of galaxies of the corresponding luminosity by a factor of 1.52 . we conclude that observed rotation curves and dynamical properties of `` normal '' spiral galaxies appear to be consistent with standard . </S>"
