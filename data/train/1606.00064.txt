    "there are numerous examples of systems that can be described as individual particles or a collection of particles interacting with a periodic quasi - one dimensional ( q1d ) substrate , including colloids on optically created q1d substrates @xcite or q1d line pinning @xcite , vortices in type - ii superconductors with one - dimensional ( 1d ) periodic thickness modulations @xcite , and various frictional systems @xcite . in the colloidal systems a variety of commensurate - incommensurate states can occur such as crystal , smectic , and disordered structures @xcite . in vortex systems , under an applied driving force",
    "a series of peaks or dips in the critical depinning force can appear which are also associated with commensuration effects @xcite .",
    "these systems , as well as other systems of particles interacting with two - dimensional ( 2d ) periodic substrates , can exhibit a variety of depinning phenomena and dynamic phases , and can undergo transitions between different types of dynamic phases that produce changes in the configuration of particles and flow behavior as well as features in the velocity - force curves @xcite . in a 2d overdamped system with a q1d periodic substrate , pinning - depinning phenomena and distinct dynamical phases appear only when the driving force is applied parallel to the substrate periodicity direction .",
    "if the drive is applied perpendicular to the substrate periodicity direction , there is no pinning effect from the substrate and the particles simply slide along the driving direction , resulting in a linear velocity - force curve .    in overdamped systems in the absence of a substrate , individual particles move in the same direction as the applied driving force . in some systems ,",
    "additional transverse forces can arise when a magnus force term @xmath0 with the form @xmath1 is present , which causes a rotation of the particle velocity into the direction perpendicular to the net applied forces .",
    "when particles with a magnus force term are driven perpendicular to the periodicity direction of a q1d periodic substrate , the magnus term creates a coupling between the motion of the particles parallel and perpendicular to the driving force , so the effect of the q1d pinning becomes relevant .",
    "a magnus term can arise for vortices in superconductors and superfluids ; however , in the case of superconducting systems it is normally very small and has little effect on the depinning and sliding dynamics . recently",
    "a new particle - like system , skyrmions in chiral magnets , was discovered in which the magnus force is much stronger @xcite . since the initial observation of skyrmions in magnetic systems , there has been a rapid growth in the field as an increasing number of systems",
    "have been identified that support skyrmions , including materials in which skyrmions are stable at room temperature @xcite .",
    "another reason for the growing interest in this field is that skyrmions could be used as magnetic information carriers , making them promising for spintronic applications @xcite .",
    "in order for spintronic or other applications of skyrmions to be realized , it is necessary to have an understanding of how skyrmions move in different types of nanostructured samples .",
    "skyrmions can be moved by an applied current @xcite , and have been shown to exhibit a pinned to sliding transition based on effective velocity - force curves that can be constructed by measuring changes in the transport properties @xcite .",
    "velocity - force curves can also be obtained by directly imaging the skyrmion motion @xcite . in many cases",
    "the skyrmion critical depinning force is very low , and this was argued to be a result of the magnus term which permits skyrmions to move around a pinning site and avoid trapping rather than moving toward the pinning site and becoming trapped as in the case of overdamped systems @xcite . under an applied driving force , the magnus term causes the skyrmion to move at an angle with respect to the driving direction , producing a skyrmion hall angle @xmath2 @xcite . in a pin - free system",
    "@xmath2 is a constant and is proportional to the ratio of the magnus term @xmath3 to the damping term @xmath4 , @xmath5 . when pinning is present , however , @xmath2 becomes drive - dependent as the skyrmions make a side jump motion when interacting with an individual pinning site , which reduces the hall angle @xcite . as the drive is increased , the side jump effect is reduced and @xmath2 approaches the clean value limit . in ref .",
    "@xcite an imaging technique provided direct evidence for the drive dependence of the skyrmion hall angle , with a linear dependence of the ratio of the transverse to longitudinal skyrmion velocity as a function of drive .",
    "these studies have focused on point - like pinning or circular pinning sites ; however , it should also be possible to create line - like pinning using various lithographic techniques such as 1d periodic thickness modulation , periodic magnetic strips , or optical techniques .    in this work we use a particle - based simulation to examine individual and collectively interacting skyrmions in a 2d system in the presence of a q1d periodic substrate , as described section ii .",
    "the particle model is based on a modified thiele equation @xcite which agrees well with continuum - based simulations in the limit where the overlap of adjacent skyrmions is small @xcite . in section",
    "iii we describe the results for the single skyrmion limit , where if the drive is applied parallel to the substrate periodicity direction , we find that unlike the case of point - like pinning , the depinning threshold does not decrease with increasing magnus term magnitude since the skyrmions can not simply move around the pinning sites . when the drive is applied perpendicular to the substrate periodicity direction , in the overdamped limit there is no depinning threshold and the skyrmions simply slide without any structural change for increasing drive , producing a linear velocity - force curve . on the other hand , when there is a finite magnus term we observe a rich variety of dynamical behaviors even in the single skyrmion limit .",
    "for perpendicular drives , the skyrmion motion is locked in the drive direction at low drives until a critical driving force is reached at which the skyrmions also start move partially parallel to the substrate periodicity direction , coinciding with a sudden drop in the net velocity of the skyrmion and producing a negative differential conductivity effect . at higher drives the skyrmion velocity again increases with increasing drive .",
    "we also show that when the skyrmion motion is locked in the direction of the drive , a speed up effect occurs where the skyrmion moves faster than it would in the overdamped limit due to the alignment of the pinning - induced velocity from the magnus term with the driving force direction .",
    "this speed up effect was initially observed in simulations of point - like pinning @xcite ; however , the effect is more easily controlled with q1d pinning . when the driving is applied parallel to the substrate periodicity direction",
    ", there is no speed up effect but instead an enhanced damping appears . in section",
    "iv we examine collectively interacting skyrmions and show that the same speed up effect and transition from locked motion in the direction of drive to motion in both the longitudinal and transverse directions occur .",
    "in addition , a series of dynamical phases appear that can be characterized by the structure of the moving skyrmions , and the transitions between these phases are correlated with distinct features in the transport curves .",
    "the phases include a moving smectic and a moving liquid which can undergo dynamical ordering transitions into a moving quasi - ordered hexatic lattice or a moving crystal .",
    "we map out the dynamic phases as a function of the substrate strength and the ratio of the magnus force to the dissipative term . in section",
    "v we examine the effect of changing the ratio of the skyrmion density to the periodicity of the substrate , where we observe chainlike structures consisting of multiple rows of skyrmions per substrate minimum .",
