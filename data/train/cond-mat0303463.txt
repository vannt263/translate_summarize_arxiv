    "the interest in studying moving nonlinear localized excitations ( solitons , kink - solitons , etc . ) is mainly motivated by the fact that they can be related to transport properties . in this respect , one dimensional lattices of anharmonic oscillators can serve as a testing ground for nonlinear transport . in this letter we present numerical and analytical studies of the dynamical properties of strongly localized excitations of anharmonic lattices with two - body interparticle potentials  @xcite .",
    "invariance under the symmetry transformation that shifts the positions of all the oscillators by the same amount relates anharmonic lattices with interparticle couplings to a wide class of systems which share such continuous symmetry , e.g. quasi - one dimensional easy plane ferromagnets and antiferromagnets , ferrimagnetic systems with spiral structures and even quantum hall double layer pseudo - ferromagnets  @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous breakdown of this translational symmetry leads to the apperance of gapless goldstone modes , which itself generates kink - soliton solutions in the presence of nonlinearity .",
    "anomalous transport properties  @xcite could appear for all systems in this class .",
    "it is extremely important to assess whether such properties could be related to the existence of moving localized excitations . in the weakly nonlinear continuum limit and for",
    "gapless dispersion relations one can prove  @xcite that all localized solutions can be described by the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) or modified kdv ( mkdv ) equations  @xcite .",
    "on the lattice , small - amplitude solutions can be represented as kdv or mkdv solitons in terms of relative displacements , while they are kinks for absolute displacements .",
    "the energy of such objects is proportional to the kink amplitude and thus lattice discreteness has to be taken into account when considering high energy ( i.e. strongly localized ) objects . since in this limit one can not use the ordinary continuum approximation , rosenau @xcite",
    "has recently proposed a theoretical approach that takes explicitly into account lattice discreteness . applying this approach to the fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) lattice  @xcite , he derived , in the limit of strong nonlinearity , a different continuum equation , which supports a new kind of localized solution that he called _ compacton _  @xcite .    on the other hand , the existence of approximate kink - like solutions of the fpu lattice with characteristic sinusoidal displacement pattern with the  magic",
    "\" wavenumber @xmath0 has been predicted on the basis of a direct analysis of the discrete lattice equations @xcite .",
    "this ansatz relies on the existence of exact extended propagating nonlinear sinusoidal waves having this particular wavenumber  @xcite .",
    "such patterns are also extremely successful in modelling stationary and slowly - moving discrete breathers in the fpu lattice  @xcite .",
    "the numerical study of moving strongly localized excitations of anharmonic lattices has been so far limited to discrete breathers ( db )  @xcite that move with small velocity .",
    "two types of numerical methods have been commonly used to study the time evolution of db s : _",
    "i ) _ exact  @xcite or approximate @xcite db s are put initially onto the lattice and _ ii ) _ modulational instability of zone - boundary and large - wavenumber modes is induced  @xcite .",
    "the first method allows one to investigate single moving localized objects , but it assumes the knowledge of exact or approximate solutions . by using the second method , a number of localized modes is produced : they move , collide and merge , and it is therefore hard to investigate each single moving object .",
    "on the other hand , no mathematical proof of existence of moving db s has been obtained ( see @xcite for a discussion of this issue and a possible way out ) .    in this letter",
    "we show a new numerical method to produce strongly localized objects .",
    "this method is inspired by the one used in real experiments to generate optical solitons in fibers as well as magnetization envelope solitons in yttrium iron garnet film waveguides  @xcite .",
    "a sharp pulse is applied at one end of an unperturbed sample .",
    "then , the system itself chooses the stable propagating localized mode and the only thing that is left is to follow its motion .",
    "we have first performed these numerical experiments for an fpu chain with quadratic and quartic interactions between neighbors , which describes purely transverse vibrational excitations . for large amplitudes , we observe supersonic strongly localized discrete kink - solitons ( dk ) in which just three oscillators are excited .",
    "they show very low energy loss . we have repeated these experiments for more realistic lennard - jones ( lj )",
    "interparticle potentials , also revealing the existence of dk s .",
    "fast moving kinks have been observed in the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model  @xcite .",
    "moving kinks appear also in translationally invariant lattices with hertz potentials ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , but in this case there is no attractive force and the localized wave dynamics is different from that of the fpu lattice .",
    "the equations of motion of the fpu-@xmath1 lattice  @xcite are @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the transverse displacement of the @xmath4-th oscillator from its equilibrium position in dimensionless units .    in the numerical experiment",
    "we oscillate the first particle of the chain in the following manner : @xmath5   \\qquad \\mbox{if } \\qquad 0<t\\leq",
    "t_0 \\qquad \\mbox{and } \\nonumber \\\\ & & u_1=0 \\qquad \\mbox{if } \\qquad t > t_0 , \\label{1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the right end @xmath6 is pinned .",
    "after applying the above pulse , we pin both ends of the lattice .",
    "the numerical experiment shows the existence of kinks that propagate with large and slightly different velocities . throughout this paper",
    "we will use two different representations of the spatial profile : either we use absolute lattice displacements @xmath3 or we show relative displacements @xmath7 .",
    "hence the kinks are shown as true steps in the first representation ( see fig .",
    "1a ) or as sharp peaks in the second representation ( see fig .",
    "1b ) .    as time evolves , the plateaus between the dk s widen but the shape of the kinks does not change . during the collisions , the kink - solitons cross each other without any appreciable energy loss (",

    "we observe a sequence of kinks with different amplitudes , while in the @xmath11-space the localized objects have solitonic form of different height .",

    "this simulation is performed with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15.,title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]    the existence of these localized objects is possible because of the peculiar symmetry @xmath16 of the interparticle potential .",
    "systems with such a symmetry have an infinitely degenerate ground state and its spontaneous breakdown leads to the appearance of gapless goldstone modes that determine the formation of kinks .",
    "since the potential energy of the fpu chain is only a function of the relative displacements @xmath8 , these are the variables to be considered for the appropriate physical picture . in these new variables the equations of motion ( [ 2 ] )",
    "can be exactly rewritten as @xmath17 eq . ( [ 4 ] ) leads , in the continuum approximation and selecting one direction for the wave motion , to the modified korteweg - de vries ( mkdv ) equation if one keeps only the first terms in the two small parameters @xmath18 and amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the mkdv equation supports exact soliton solutions",
    ". indeed , for small pulse amplitudes we could observe mkdv solitons .",
    "however , as the driving amplitude @xmath19 of the pulse is increased we observe the dk s of fig .",
    "1 . therefore , in terms of relative displacements , the objects that we observe in our simulations can be considered as discrete extension of the solutions of the mkdv equation .",
    "the existence of fast moving objects with amplitude independent short localization length was first considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the remaining of this letter",
    ", we develop a theoretical approach that , making use of this result allows us to describe the main physical properties of the dk s we observe in our simulations .",
    "exact extended sinusoidal wave solutions of the fpu ( and other ) lattices have been recently found by several authors  @xcite .",
    "one of such solutions has the  magic \" @xmath0 wavenumber and can be written in terms of relative displacements as @xmath20 .",
    "it has been proposed that such exact solution can acquire a compact support and maintain its validity as approximate solution  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case of stationary and slowly - moving discrete breathers in the fpu-@xmath1 lattice , half a period truncations of the sinusoidal envelope of the displacement patterns with @xmath21 wavenumber well reproduce large amplitude localized oscillations  @xcite .",
    "following the same strategy , we here propose a similar truncation that turns out to describe very well our supersonic dk s : @xmath22   \\qquad \\mbox{if } \\qquad -\\pi<\\frac{2\\pi}{3}n- \\omega t<\\pi ;   \\label{111}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath23 otherwise . in the large amplitude limit",
    "we can neglect short exponential tails in the sinusoidal pattern ( [ 111 ] ) ( see , however , eq .",
    "( 6 ) below ) . substituting this ansatz into eq  ( [ 4 ] ) and performing the rotating wave approximation @xcite for the second harmonic , we obtain the following relations for the frequency @xmath24 and velocity @xmath25 as the functions of the amplitude @xmath26 of the dk s .",

    "furthermore , the right graph of fig .",
    "2 shows that the relative displacement patterns of both the measured and the analytical solution has everywhere a smooth envelope .",
