    "a tremendous interest in surface structures and phase transitions grew out of the fact that surface systems are ideal for exploring the effects of competing interactions @xcite .",
    "a form of competing interactions seen in adsorption involves either a length scale or a symmetry mismatch between the adsorbate - adsorbate interaction and the adsorbate - substrate interaction @xcite .",
    "some consequences of such mismatches include density modulations @xcite , domain walls @xcite , epitaxial rotation in the adsorbed layer @xcite , and a disruption of the normal periodicity and growth in the film @xcite .",
    "domain wall systems in monolayers can be thought of as some of the first examples of ordering at the nanoscale , where the length scale is defined by the lattice mismatch , and interestingly , mismatched systems are now designed and used for growing nanostructure arrays having specific symmetries and spacings .    after the discovery of quasicrystals , an interest grew in the possibility of using quasicrystal surfaces as substrates to grow quasicrystalline films of a single element , which do not occur in nature @xcite .",
    "such a system necessarily has a lattice mismatch between the adsorbate and the substrate , and the effects are seen in the diverse examples of film structures and growth modes that occur for these systems @xcite .",
    "there is now interest in being able to design and produce quasiperiodic arrays of nanoclusters on quasicrystal surfaces , but the complex interactions involved in the adsorbate - substrate interactions make it difficult to design specific nanostructures .    recently , our group has begun to explore the behavior of simple gases physisorbed on quasicrystalline surfaces @xcite .",
    "the key questions motivating these studies are analogous to those for periodic substrates ; for example , what are the energy scales of the adsorbed film and what is the resulting structure of the film ?",
    "the latter problem includes a specific question : under what conditions , if any , of temperature @xmath0 and vapor pressure @xmath1 does the film form an epitaxial phase on the surface and when does it form an alternative structure , a hexagonal , close - packed array of atoms or molecules ( i.e. , the film s ground state within the two - dimensional ( 2d ) approximation ) .",
    "one expects the low @xmath2 , submonolayer behavior to be that of a film conforming to the substrate , attracted to the sites offering the highest binding energies .",
    "the hypothetical behavior at high @xmath2 includes several possibilities , e.g. bulk - like film growth , amorphous structures , island formation or the absence of any multilayer film . which of these scenarios ( or others ) actually occurs is a function of the gas - surface and gas - gas interactions .    in this article , we report the results of grand canonical monte carlo ( gcmc ) @xcite simulations of ne , ar , kr , and xe adsorbed on the tenfold surface of a decagonal al@xmath3ni@xmath4co@xmath5 quasicrystal @xcite .",
    "we organize our article as follows . in section [ section_method ]",
    "we discuss briefly the method .",
    "section [ section_results ] is devoted to the results of ne , ar , kr , and xe adsorbed on the alnico . in section [ section_discussion ] we compare the results of all gases .",

    "by using the grand canonical monte carlo ( gcmc ) simulation method @xcite we study the adsorption of noble gases : ne , ar , kr , and xe on the tenfold surface of a decagonal al@xmath3ni@xmath4co@xmath5 quasicrystal @xcite ( he is omitted because it requires a quantum treatment and rn is omitted because it is not convenient experimentally ) . in this article",
    ", we use the abbreviation qc to refer to this particular quasicrystalline substrate .",
    "gcmc , a widely used method , is described in detail in references @xcite .",
    "only a brief overview is given here .",
    "at constant temperature , @xmath6 , and volume , @xmath7 , the gcmc method explores the configurational phase space using the metropolis algorithm and finds the equilibrium number of adsorbed atoms ( adatoms ) , @xmath8 , as a function of the chemical potential , @xmath9 , of the gas .",
    "the adsorbed atoms are in equilibrium with the coexisting gas : the chemical potential of the gas is constant throughout the system .",
    "in addition , the coexisting gas is taken to be ideal . with this method",
    "we determine adsorption isotherms , @xmath10 , and density profiles , @xmath11 , as a function of the pressure , @xmath12 .",
    "for each data point in an isotherm , we perform at least 18 million gcmc steps to reach equilibrium .",
    "each step is an attempted displacement , creation , or deletion of an atom with execution probabilities equal to 0.2 , 0.4 , and 0.4 , respectively @xcite .",
    "at least 27 million steps are performed in the subsequent data - gathering and -averaging phase .",
    "the unit cell is tetragonal .",
    "we take a square section of the surface , @xmath13 , of side 5.12 nm , to be the @xmath14 part of the unit cell in the simulation , for which we assume periodic boundary conditions along the basal directions .",
    "although this assumption limits the accuracy of the long range qc structure , it is numerically necessary for these simulations .",
    "since the size of the cell is relatively large compared to that of the noble gases , the cell is accurately representative of order on short - to - moderate length scales .",
    "a hard wall at 10 nm above the surface along @xmath15 is used to confine the coexisting vapor phase .",
    "the simulation results for xe over qc , presented below , are consistent with both our results from experiments @xcite and virial calculations @xcite .",
    "hence , the calculations may also be accurate for other systems .",
    "the gas - gas potentials are taken to be lennard - jones ( lj ) 12 - 6 interactions , with the parameter values @xmath16 and @xmath17 listed in table [ table_lj ] .",
    "the gas - surface potentials are based on a summation of two - body interactions between the gas and the individual constituent atoms of the substrate : al , ni and co @xcite .",
    "the gas - surface pair interactions are also assumed to have lj form , with parameter values taken from traditional combining rules , using atomic sizes derived from bulk crystalline lattice constants @xcite .",
    "the lj gas - surface parameters are @xmath18 and @xmath19 for al , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the two transition metals ni and co. all these values are listed in the upper part of table [ table_lj ] . in the calculation of the adsorption potential , we assume a structure of the unrelaxed surface taken from the empirical fit to leed data @xcite .    .",

    "tm is the label for ni or co. the prefixes i and d refer to hypothetical inflated and deflated variants of real atoms , as discussed in the text .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the definition of a gas - qc mismatch parameter is not unique . for example , one can substitute @xmath22 with the first nn distance of the bulk gas , and @xmath23 with one of the following characteristic lengths : a ) side length of the central pentagon in the potential plots in fig .",
    "[ fig_potminandhist ] ( @xmath24 nm ) , b ) distance between the center of the central pentagon and one of its vertices ( @xmath25 nm ) , c ) @xmath26 nm , where @xmath27 = 1.618 is the golden ratio of the qc and @xmath28 = 0.243 nm is the side length of the rhombic penrose tiles @xcite .",
    "although there is no _ a priori _ reason to choose one definition over the others , the one that we select ( equation @xmath29 ) has the convenience of being perfectly correlated with the presence of the transition , and of using reference lengths commonly determined in experimental measurements ( @xmath23 ) or quantities easy to extract ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "in figure [ fig_potminandhist ] we can observe that near the center of each potential there is a set of five points with the highest binding interaction ( the dark spots constituting the central pentagons ) .",
    "a real qc surface contains an infinite number of these very attractive positions which are located at regular distances and with five fold symmetry . due to the limited size and shape of the simulation cell ,",
    "our surface contains only one set of these points .",
    "therefore , it is of our concern to check if the results regarding the existence of the transition are real or artifacts of the method .",
    "we perform simulation tests by mitigating the effect of the attractive spots through a gaussian smoothing function which reduces the corrugation of the original potential .",
    "the definitions are the following : @xmath30 + v(z)\\cdot g(x , y , z).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the gaussian smoothing function ( centered on the origin and with parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 is the average over @xmath14 of the original potential @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the final smoothed interaction .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig_potminmod](a ) where we plot the minimum of the adsorption potential for a ne / qc modified interaction ( smoothed using @xmath37 and @xmath38 nm ) .",
    "in addition , in panel ( b ) we show the variations of the minimum adsorption potentials along line @xmath39 for the modified and original interactions ( solid and dotted curves , respectively ) .    using the modified interactions ( with @xmath37 and @xmath38 nm ) we simulate all the noble gases of table [ table_mismatch ] .",
    "the results regarding the phase transition on modified surfaces do not differ from those on unmodified ones , confirming that the observed transition behavior is a consequence of competing interactions between the adsorbate and the whole qc substrate rather than just depinning of the monolayer epitaxially nucleated .",
    "therefore , the simple criterion for the existence of the transition ( @xmath40 ) might also be relevant for predicting such phenomena on other decagonal quasicrystal substrates .",
    "we have presented the results of gcmc simulations of noble gas films on qc .",
    "ne , ar , kr , and xe grow layer - by - layer at low temperatures up to several layers before bulk condensation . we observe interesting phenomena that can only be attributed to the quasicrystallinity and/or corrugation of the substrate , including structural evolution of the overlayer films from commensurate pentagonal to incommensurate triangular , substrate - induced alignment of the incommensurate films , and density increase in each layer with the largest one observed in the first layer and in the smallest gas .",
    "two - dimensional quasicrystalline epitaxial structures of the overlayer form in all the systems only in the monolayer regime and at low pressure .",
    "the final structure of the films is a triangular lattice with a considerable amount of defects except in xe / qc . here",
    "a first - order transition occurs in the monolayer regime resulting in an almost perfect triangular lattice .",
    "the subsequent layers of xe / qc have hexagonal close - packed structures . by simulating fictitious systems with various sizes and strengths , we find that the dimension of the noble gas , @xmath17 , is the most crucial parameter in determining the existence of the phenomenon which is found only in systems with @xmath41[xe ]",
    ". the results of this study will be investigated in future experiments carried out in this laboratory , analogous to those already performed with xe .",
    "this work stimulates more comprehensive studies of adsorption heterogeneities on qc to understand the fundamental factors controlling the structure of single - element films by elucidating phenomena that are due exclusively to the quasiperiodicity of the substrate , as opposed to chemical interactions between the adsorbates and the surface .",
