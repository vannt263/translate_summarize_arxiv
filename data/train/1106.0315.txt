    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are nonnuclear x - ray sources with luminosity above the eddington limit of stellar mass black holes ( @xmath3  erg  s@xmath4 ) assuming isotropic emission .",
    "ulxs with fast variability or long - term chaotic flux variation may contain accreting black holes in an attached binary system .",
    "they could be powered by accretion onto either intermediate mass black holes of @xmath5  @xmath6 at sub - eddington rate @xcite or normal or slightly massive stellar black holes of @xmath7  @xmath6 at super or near eddington rate @xcite .",
    "in black hole binaries , the x - ray emission probes the deep potential at regions close to the event horizon while the optical emission is important to constrain their masses , interaction with environment , and evolutionary history of the binary .",
    "optical observations of ulxs have played a key role in unveiling the nature of these sources .",
    "many bright ulxs are found to be spatially associated with an optical nebula @xcite .",
    "these nebulae are large with an extent of tens to hundreds pc , and expanding at a velocity in the order of @xmath8  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "most of them are powered by strong shocks created by outflows from the binary hitting the surrounding medium , and in a few cases , extraordinary photoionization is required @xcite .",
    "the photoionized nebulae can be used as bolometers to extreme ultraviolet and soft x - ray photons , and suggest that the ulx luminosities are indeed high .",
    "point - like optical objects as compact counterparts of ulxs have been identified for 10 sources in the literature .",
    "the companion star , intrinsic emission from the disk at large radii , and disk irradiation may all contribute to the optical emission and even dominate at different wavelengths .",
    "binary population synthesis indicates that colors and magnitudes of the optical counterpart of ulxs can help distinguish between stellar mass and intermediate mass black holes , and a sample of 6 sources favors the latter interpretation @xcite .",
    "the continuum component in the optical spectrum of ngc 5408 x-1 is consistent with that from a standard accretion disk with irradiation @xcite .",
    "however , this result is obtained from a ground - based telescope so the nebular contribution can not be directly resolved and has to be subtracted based on model prediction . therefore , in most cases , hst observations are required for the study of the compact optical counterpart of ulxs , in particular for the continuum emission .",
    "there are 10 ulxs with a unique optical counterpart identified in the literature .",
    "we make 3 new identifications in this paper . here",

    "it seems that @xmath16 often overestimate the total extinction .",
    "plus , the x - ray column density usually varies dramatically , causing additional difficulty in deriving the extinction .",
    "thus , we adopt galactic extinction when the nebular extinction is unavailable , and this should be treated as the lower limit . a galactic extinction law @xcite is assumed for reddening correction .",
    "except for the small handful of images in the near uv ( f330w filter ) , the resultant magnitude varies very little , by 0.002 typically , if we choose a different reddening law for the excessive extinction above the milky way , like that for the small magellanic clouds where the metallicity is significantly lower .",
    "we hence use the galactic reddening law for all objects despite that metal poor environments have been suggested for a few of them ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a power - law spectrum is assumed to convert from the observed count rate or magnitude to the intrinsic flux or magnitude .",

    "the ulx counterparts differ from the nearby stars in that their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are well fitted with a single power - law , while those of the nearby stars show a roll - over at short wavelengths suggesting a blackbody - like spectrum with a moderate temperature . also , the nearby stars are less luminous than the ulx counterpart .",

    "we have analyzed the largest sample to date of hst observations of ulxs with a unique compact optical counterpart including 3 new identifications and 10 counterparts identified in the literature .",
    "for each source , we measured the broad band optical spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , its variation , and the x - ray to optical flux ratio . in the following ,",
    "we discuss constraints on the nature of ulxs and their optical emission derived from our results .",
    "x - ray variability rules out that ulxs are clusters of galaxies , normal galaxies , or normal stars .",
    "the @xmath63 distribution of ulx in our sample , peaked around 3 , suggests that most of them are x - ray binaries instead of agn or bl lac objects , whose @xmath63 ranges from @xmath64 to 1.2 or 0.3 to 1.7 , respectively @xcite .",
    "optical light from an x - ray binary can arise from the companion star , direct emission from the accretion disk , reprocessing of x - rays from the inner disk in the outer disk , or some combination of the above .",
    "if the optical light is dominated by the companion star , then the optical colors in all observations should be consistent with a single spectral type and the optical variability should be low .",
    "the only variable stars with colors and magnitudes similar to those of most ulx counterparts are @xmath65-cepheid and pv telescopii stars ; such star have variabilities of 0.1 mag or less @xcite ; even heated companion stars , which would vary in an ellipsoidal pattern , are ruled out due to the irregular variation of most ulxs . if the optical light is dominated by direct emission from a multi - color disk blackbody ( mcd ) , then the optical sed should have a @xmath66 form consistent with extrapolation of the x - ray spectrum and there should be significant optical variability . if the optical light is dominated by reprocessing of x - ray in the outer accretion disk , then the optical sed should have a roughly power - law form with an index between about @xmath64 to @xmath67 @xcite and , again , there should be significant optical variability , correlated with the x - ray variability . also , the x - ray to optical flux ratio should be similar to those observed from lmxbs , in which the optical light is usually dominated by reprocessing of x - ray in the outer accretion disk when in active states .",
    "if the companion and disk produce comparable optical fluxes , then the variability would be reduced relative to that expected from a disk alone and the sed would be a combination of a roughly power - law and a blackbody form .",
    "the observed @xmath49 , variability , stellar spectrum fitting , and spectral index are used as evaluation criteria for different models in table  [ tab : model ] .",
    "these properties favor the irradiated disk model for most sources .",
    "the distributions of @xmath49 , @xmath22 , and @xmath68 of ulxs in the sample appear to be similar to lmxbs , see figure  [ fig : color_histogram ] and [ fig : xor ] .",
    "this does not mean that ulxs actually contain low mass companions , but suggests that the optical spectra of ulxs are dominated by emission from the disk instead of the companion star .",
    "the fact that the whole optical sed of most ulxs can not be matched with a single spectral type , see table  [ tab : sp ] , is further evidence that the optical emission is not dominated by the companion stars .",
    "some sources show significant optical variability : m101 ulx-1 , m81 uls1 , ngc 1313 x-2 , and ngc 5204 x-1 .",
    "notably , both sources for which there are more than 10 observations , m101 ulx-1 and ngc 1313 x-2 , show significant variability .",
    "the non - detection of optical variability in the other sources may be due to the limited number of observations available .",
    "further , these two sources also show color variations that can not be explained as solely due to changes in extinction , there must be intrinsic changes in the optical spectra .",
    "the detected optical variability is 0.2 mag or larger .",
    "the only variable stars with colors and magnitudes similar to those of the ulx counterparts are @xmath65-cepheid and pv telescopii stars .",
    "however , such star have variabilities of 0.1 mag or less @xcite .",
    "thus , the variability is inconsistent with a scenario in which the companion star dominates the optical light .",
    "the variability is consistent with the assertion that the optical light from ulxs is dominated by emission from the disk .",
    "the optical spectral index @xmath1 , see figure  [ fig : alpha ] , for most of the ulxs in our sample lies in the range @xmath69 to @xmath67 .",
    "irradiated disks can produce optical spectra with such slopes @xcite .",
    "a spectrum with @xmath28 corresponds to the rayleigh - jeans tail of thermal emission and would be produced if all of the optically emitting regions have temperatures above @xmath70  k corresponding to the shortest wavelength of the observed optical photons .",
    "spectral indexes between @xmath64 and @xmath67 suggest that there are optically emitting regions of the disk with temperatures down to @xmath71  k. variations in the optical brightness and spectral slope of the reprocessed emission could be produced by variations in the x - ray flux from of the central object , the disk radius , or the fraction of flux intercepted by the outer disk .",
    "a b0 ib supergiant companion has been suggested for ngc 5204 x-1 based on uv spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "we re - examined the data but found that the si  iii  @xmath72  line that was used for the classification lies close to the strong geocoronal o  i  @xmath73  line , and is thus suspicious .",
    "a background spectrum also shows a similar absorption feature .",
    "plus , characteristic absorption lines like c  iv and si  iv seen in typical b0 ib spectra do not appear in the spectrum of ngc 5204 x-1 . in the current study ,",
    "the source displays remarkable variation in color or spectral index , see source # 11 in figure  [ fig : alpha ] , that could not be produced if the optical emission is dominated by light from the companion star . also , the x - ray to optical flux ratio is consistent with that for a lmxb .",
    "we therefore argue that the optical / uv emission of ngc 5204 x-1 is dominated by the accretion disk and not by a supergiant companion star .",
    "if the optical light is due to thermal emission , then the size of the emitting region can be estimated from the flux density measured at a particular frequency using planck s law if the temperature and distance to the source are known .",
    "assuming a simple blackbody model for the optical emission , the measurements for holmberg ix x-1 suggest an emitting region size of @xmath74  cm for a distance of 3.6  mpc and a blackbody temperature of @xmath75  k. the size estimate decreases by a factor of @xmath76 if the assumed temperature is increased by a factor of 10 to @xmath77  k. the size depends more sensitively on temperature for lower temperatures ; it increases by a factor of 2 if the temperature is decreased to @xmath78  k and a factor of 9 for @xmath79  k. temperatures lower than 5000  k appear to be excluded by the optical spectral shape for most of the sources .",
    "it is possible to check if the size of the emitting region is consistent with a picture in which the optical emission is due to reprocessing . assuming a fraction @xmath80 of the x - ray luminosity @xmath81 is reprocessed ,",
    "then @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the temperature and area , respectively , of the reprocessing region and @xmath85 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . inserting @xmath86  k , @xmath87  cm@xmath30 , and @xmath89  , we find @xmath90 .",
    "this is similar to values found for the galactic black hole x - ray binary xte j1817@xmath9330 when in soft spectral states similar to those usually observed from ulxs @xcite .",
    "thus , again , the properties of the optical emission appear to be consistent with reprocessing .",
    "the milky way black hole binary with the longest orbital period , grs  1915 + 105 , has a separation of @xmath91  cm and an outer disk radius of @xmath92  cm , comparable to the values discussed here . the 60 day x - ray periodicity seen from m82 x-1 @xcite is longer than that of grs  1915 + 105 , suggesting a larger orbital separation . the binary separation of m82 x-1 is estimated to be a few times @xmath93  cm @xcite . in general , large accretion disks , of order @xmath2  cm , would require long orbital periods .",

    "shorter periods would be possible for more massive black holes .",
    "the @xmath21 vs.  @xmath22 diagram can be compared directly with that obtained from binary population synthesis , in which they assume the optical spectrum comprised of emission from both a steady thin disk and the companion @xcite .",
    "based on their models , the most likely color of ulxs is about @xmath106 independent of the mass of the accretor",
    ". however , ulxs with an intermediate mass black hole are brighter than those with a super - eddington stellar mass black hole of the same luminosity , with the most probable @xmath107 for the former and @xmath108 for the latter .",
    "our results are consistent with their model that most ulxs have a @xmath22 color about @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",
    "the concentration of most sources at @xmath107 would suggest that most ulxs in our sample contain intermediate mass black holes .",
    "however , we note that this result is model dependent . other binary evolution models with different assumptions , i.e.  that some mass is lost from the system rather than all mass being accreted @xcite , could lead to different conclusions .",
    "ngc 2403 x-1 has an optical spectral index consistent with that expected , @xmath27 , for the intrinsic emission of a standard multicolor disk .",
    "assuming @xmath27 , its optical spectrum can be written as @xmath111  . a face - on standard disk at 3.2  mpc with an inner temperature @xmath112  kev and a bolometric luminosity @xmath113  , or with @xmath114  kev and @xmath115  , can produce an optical tail consistent with the observed spectrum .",
    "the measured x - ray luminosity for the source ranges from 3 to @xmath116  @xcite which is in the required range .",
    "thus , the optical emission for this source may be dominated by intrinsic emission from an accretion disk .",
    "however , simultaneous x - ray and optical / uv observations are needed to test this hypothesis .",
    "the optical spectrum of m83 ixo 82 could be consistent with the @xmath27 expected for intrinsic emission of a standard multicolor disk if our assumed reddening is incorrect .",
    "we calculated the reddening assuming only galactic absorption of @xmath117 .",
    "additional intrinsic absorption of @xmath118 would make @xmath1 consistent with @xmath119 .",
    "this source shows an absolute visual magnitude , @xmath120 , and an x - ray luminosity , @xmath121  @xcite , similar to that of ngc 2403 x-1 .",
    "thus , this source is also a good candidate to have optical emission dominated by intrinsic emission from an accretion disk .     for the data from 1994 apr 08 .",
    "[ fig : m101ulx ] ]      m101 ulx-1 and m81 uls1 are exceptional cases owing to their strong x - ray variability and deviation from the main population in the x - ray to optical flux ratio distributions .",
    "especially when in the low state , their x - ray to optical flux ratios are consistent with that of agn .",
    "however , detection of variability on time scales of @xmath122  s from both sources @xcite , more rapid than the x - ray variability seen from agn , makes an agn identification unlikely .",
    "the x - ray to optical flux ratio of the two sources is consistent with that of hmxbs .",
    "many galactic hxmbs , especially with a neutron star accretor , are transient sources with huge variability due to uneven wind - fed accretion in an elliptical orbit .",
    "the high luminosity and moderate absorption column density of these ulxs suggest that they are roche - lobe overflow system , where circular orbits are often presumed .",
    "however , the large long - term variability of these two systems may suggest eccentric orbits .",

    "[ fig : m101ulx ] .",
    "there is variability at every waveband where there are multiple observations and the variations are stronger at long wavelengths .",
    "the variability could be explained in a disk irradiation as due to changes in the outer disk radius .",
    "if the blue wing of the spectrum is due to companion light , then a very hot star would be required .",
    "we note that @xcite fitted the same data using the sum of a wolf - rayet star , an irradiated disk described by an @xmath69 spectrum , and an additional hot component ascribed to the x - ray heated side of the companion .",
    "we note that more complex irradiated disk models @xcite can produce the extra hot component needed by @xcite in the inner regions of the disk suffice without need of an additional physical surface .",
    "in contrast , the optical spectrum of m81 uls1 is significantly shallower . at least for one observation ,",
    "the spectrum could be consistent with @xmath27 as expected for intrinsic emission of a standard multicolor disk if there is additional reddening beyond the galactic value assumed in our analysis .",
    "we note that @xcite modeled the blue part of the optical spectrum as due to direct disk emission .",
    "however , this modeling was based on simultaneous fitting of hst observations obtained over a period of 4 years . given the highly variable nature of the source , it is important to better constrain the spectral behavior with simultaneous observations extending into the uv .",

    "however , the spectrum from september 2005 shows a cutoff in the f330w band , inconsistent with the power - law .",
    "fitting to the combined data favors the blackbody model .",
    "such blackbody emission could arise from a companion star .",
    "there is no evidence of optical variability and a spectral classification of f5 ib or iab fits all the data available at both observation epochs .",
    "if the reddening is less than the nebular value we have assumed , then the star would be a later spectral type , i.e.  f8-g0 ib @xcite .",
    "such blackbody emission could also arise from irradiation in a very large disk . for ic",
    "342 x-1 , the blackbody fitting suggests a surface area of @xmath125  cm@xmath30 , or a reflector radius of @xmath93  cm , which is about an order of magnitude larger than the value inferred for the majority of ulxs .",
