    "two celebrated theories of the modern physics are the general theory of relativity ( gtr ) and the quantum field theory ( qft )",
    ". gtr unifies the special theory of relativity and the gravity and it evolves our understanding of the universe around us by providing a geometric interpretation of gravitation .",
    "it has some magnificent predictions such as light deflection by gravity , gravitational waves , and black holes @xcite . on the other hand , qft which combines the elements of quantum mechanics and",
    "the special theory of relativity , theoretically describes the interactions of the fundamental forces and subatomic particles .",
    "qft in the curved spacetime leads to fascinating predictions such as particle production by the time - dependent gravitational fields , or by the time - independent gravitational fields that contain horizons @xcite .",
    "qft in the curved spacetime is regarded as the first approximation to the quantum gravity .    even for the small values of spacetime curvature , experimental observation of the predictions of qft in the curved spacetime",
    "seems to be impossible . to examine such predictions",
    ", one can employ the notion of quantum simulation ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "various analog models have been proposed as the simulators for these theories @xcite .",
    "these analog models provide accessible experimental models for quantum field theory in curved space - time .",
    "some properties ( mainly kinematic ) of gtr can be investigated by the analogies with accessible physical systems @xcite .    since their first experimental realization in alkalis @xcite , bose - einstein condensates ( becs )",
    "have been investigated extensively from both theoretical and experimental points of view @xcite .",
    "several aspects of the gtr and qft have been analyzed by analogy with a bec @xcite .",
    "the phononic perturbations in a bec satisfy the klein - gordon equation in a curved spacetime and the corresponding metric possesses a singularity which can be regarded as an acoustic analog black hole .",
    "therefore , becs offer a unique opportunity to explore the basic principles of qft in the curved spacetime .",
    "in addition , loading ultracold atomic gasses into optical lattices has opened a promising route oriented towards the investigation of strongly correlated quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "there is a close analogy between ultracold atomic gasses inside light - induced periodic potentials and electrons in crystal lattices .",
    "the nonlinear atom - atom interactions are responsible for the collective fluid - like behavior in bec @xcite .",
    "understanding quantum phase transitions and their underlying physics is one of the goals of many - body physics .",
    "superfluid to mott insulator phase transition , first experimentally reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , is the most famous example of such phase transitions at zero temperature .",
    "the high flexibility and tunability of optical lattices and the condensate provide us a unique opportunity to explore the quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "long decoherence time ( of the order of seconds ) makes the trapped bosonic atoms in an optical lattice to be a good candidate for the applications of quantum simulations @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice is effectively described by a discrete bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite , which describes the tunneling of trapped atoms between the lowest vibrational states of the optical lattice .",

    "in other words , continuous fields can be viewed as the limiting case of discrete fields when the distance between two adjacent points tends to zero .",
    "electrons in a sheet of graphene have a dynamics analogous to the quantum field propagating in a discrete space @xcite . the effect of curvature on the current flow lines in elastically deformed graphene sheets has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian describing electrons and positrons moving in an external field has been simulated by ultracold atoms in bichromatic optical lattices @xcite .    inspired by the existing studies on the analogy between the bose - hubbard model and a trapped bec in an optical lattice , and also motivated by the analogy between curved spacetimes and becs , in the present contribution , by applying the discrete differential geometry",
    ", we investigate the analog spacetime corresponding to the phase / density fluctuations of a trapped bec in an optical lattice based on the bose - hubbard model .",
    "the discrete geometric formulation of the quantum fields is of a great significance to understand the quantum phase transitions occurring in the system . to explore the dynamics of the system , by applying the mean - field approximation",
    ", we first derive the discrete equations of motion for the mean field plus fluctuations and then , by using the density - phase representation , we obtain the dynamics of the density as well as the phase fluctuations . in the hydrodynamic limit , the phase / density fluctuations of the quantum field are found to obey the covariant klein - gordon equation for a massless scalar field propagating in a curved discrete spacetime with a specified metric .",

    "<S> we present a theoretical scheme to simulate quantum field theory in a discrete curved spacetime based on the bose - hubbard model describing a bose - einstein condensate trapped in an optical lattice . using the bose - hubbard hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> , we first introduce a hydrodynamic presentation of the system evolution in discrete space . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that the phase ( density ) fluctuations of the trapped bosons in optical lattice in superfluid ( mott insulator ) obey the klein - gordon equation for a massless scalar field propagating in a discrete curved spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the effective metrics associated with the superfluid and mott - insulator phases and , in particular , we find that in the superfluid phase the metric exhibits a singularity which is the manifestation of an analog acoustic black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed approach is found to provide a suitable platform for quantum simulation of various spacetime metrics through adjusting the system parameters . </S>"
