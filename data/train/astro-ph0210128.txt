    "observations indicate that the earth was at least warm enough for liquid water to exist as far back as 4  gyr ago , namely , as early as half a billion years after the formation of the earth @xcite ; in fact , there is evidence suggesting that earth may have been even warmer then than it is now @xcite .",
    "these relatively warm temperatures required on early earth are in apparent contradiction to the dimness of the early sun predicted by the standard solar models .",
    "this problem has generally been explained by assuming that earth s early atmosphere contained huge amounts of carbon dioxide ( co@xmath7 ) , resulting in a large enough greenhouse effect to counteract the effect of a dimmer sun .",
    "however , the recent work of @xcite places an upper limit of 0.04  bar on the partial pressure of co@xmath7 in the period from 2.75 to 2.2  gyr ago , based on the absence of siderite in paleosols ; this casts doubt on the viability of a strong co@xmath7 greenhouse effect on early earth .",
    "the existence of liquid water on early mars has been even more of a puzzle ; even the maximum possible co@xmath7 greenhouse effect can not yield warm enough martian surface temperatures @xcite .",
    "these problems can simultaneously be resolved , for both earth and mars , if the early sun were brighter than predicted by the standard solar models .",
    "this could be accomplished if the early sun were slightly more massive than it is now .",
    "helioseismic observations provide revolutionary precision for probing the solar interior .",
    "helioseismic frequencies are observed with an accuracy of a few parts in  @xmath8 , allowing measurement of the sound speed profile throughout most of the sun s interior to an accuracy of a few parts in  @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this high precision permits one to search for subtle effects in the interior structure of the present sun resulting from events in the distant past .",
    "in particular , modest mass loss ( between 1% and  7% of the sun s mass ) early on the main sequence might have left enough of a fingerprint on the interior structure of the present sun to be detectable by helioseismological observations .",
    "@xcite first presented the hypothesis that stars like the sun might lose significant amounts of mass on the early main sequence .",
    "@xcite were the first to compute solar models with such early main sequence mass loss , namely , an extreme case with an initial mass of  @xmath10 .",
    "such extreme mass loss ( of  @xmath11 ) turns out to be unrealistic , as discussed below ; but small mass loss cases can not be ruled out at the present . @xcite considered an initial solar mass of  @xmath12 , showing that this is the upper limit allowed by the observed solar lithium depletion .",
    "some work has been carried out recently attempting to use helioseismology to constrain early solar mass loss @xcite ; however , the first of these used rather crude solar interior models , and the second yielded ambiguous results , as we discuss in detail below .",
    "@xcite were the first to attempt to use helioseismic observations to constrain early solar mass loss ; they considered initial solar masses of 1.1 and  @xmath10 , concluding that the @xmath10 could be ruled out by helioseismic observations of low - degree modes .",
    "they also claimed that a mass loss timescale of 0.2  gyr was favored over a 0.45  gyr timescale for the @xmath12 case , based on `` frequencies for modes that probe just below the convection zone bottom ( @xmath13 , @xmath14hz ) , '' but this latter conclusion is rendered dubious by the fact that this is the particular region of the sun where one should expect the _",
    "worst _ agreement in models that do not attempt to include rotation - induced mixing ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , these models of @xcite were based on relatively crude approximations to the physical processes in the solar interior , particularly for the opacities .",
    "they state that their solar interior opacities used the @xcite analytical fits to the opacity tables of @xcite , with the electron scattering ( esk ) term in the iben fit being multiplied either by a factor of  1.5 to approximate the laol tables , or by a factor of  2 to approximate the ( early ) opal opacities of @xcite ; in addition , they adjusted the opacities _ separately _ for each of their solar models , by adjusting the @xmath15 term in the iben fit ( which mainly affects opacities at @xmath16k ) in order to yield a position for the base of solar envelope convection at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "even if they had in fact used the early opal opacity tables of @xcite , the models of @xcite suggest that this would be expected to yield solar models with helioseismic disagreements 2  or 3 times worse than can be achieved by models using the more recent opal opacities @xcite ; we have shown that using the laol opacity tables would result in even larger errors @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the recent mhd equation of state tables @xcite , albeit for a fixed value of @xmath18 ( the metallicity  @xmath19 actually varied from @xmath20 to @xmath21 from the envelope to the center of their models ) , but the equation of state is not very sensitive to metallicity , and we estimate that this fixed-@xmath19 approximation introduced errors in their thermodynamic quantities of no more than a few parts in  @xmath22 .",
    "they considered diffusion of hydrogen , helium , and four of the cno isotopes , using diffusion constants from @xcite ; as they point out , the fact that this treatment probably overestimates the extent of gravitational settling of heavy elements @xcite may compensate for the fact that they considered diffusion for elements comprising only 62% of the metallicity  @xmath19 .",
    "finally , @xcite compared models which had not been converged to the same final surface @xmath23 value ; their @xmath23 differences of up to  4% would by themselves yield significant ( though not major ) differences between the models , largely through the effect on the opacities @xcite .",
    "@xcite also used helioseismology to test an initial solar mass of  @xmath12 , comparing sound speed and density profiles in their solar models to profiles obtained via an inversion from helioseismic frequencies .",
    "their solar models incorporated much more up - to - date input physics ( though they also used the fixed-@xmath19 approximation in the equation of state , with @xmath24 ) , and they tested some different formulations of the input physics ; but their tests of the effects of early solar mass loss yielded results that were ambiguous at best .",
    "they first considered models using the ceff equation of state @xcite , diffusion constants from @xcite , and the more recent opal opacities @xcite ; however , in these models @xcite also used the fixed-@xmath19 approximation when interpolating the _ opacities _ , which can lead to significant opacity errors and thus significant effects on the solar models , as they themselves showed ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite compared mass - losing models with an initial mass of @xmath25 to a standard solar model ( @xmath26 ) , testing both a short ( 0.2  gyr ) and a long ( 0.45  gyr ) mass loss timescale .",
    "they found that the long mass loss timescale yielded fractional shifts of up to  @xmath27 in the sound speed profile relative to the standard solar model ( a significant but not major effect ) , while the short mass loss timescale had an insignificant effect ( of  @xmath28 , roughly one fifth as large ) .",
    "they next considered models with the opal equation of state @xcite , and where the variation of metallicity  @xmath19 inside the star _ was _ considered when interpolating in the opal opacities ( each of these latter two changes yielded shifts of up to 0.001 in the sound speed profiles of their standard solar models ) .",
    "they compared a model with an initial mass @xmath25 and their short ( 0.2  gyr ) mass loss timescale to a standard solar model , finding differences of up to  @xmath27 in the sound speed profile between them  5  times as large as the effect from the same comparison with the first set of models ( and large enough to suggest the possibility of highly significant effects from a longer mass loss timescale ) .",
    "such large disagreements between their two sets of results for the differential effects of early solar mass loss suggest that their mass - losing models may have had much larger numerical or convergence errors than they estimated for their standard solar models ; and indeed their second short - timescale mass - losing model shows sound speed disagreements near the surface that might be interpreted as being due to poor convergence to the present solar luminosity , radius , and/or surface  @xmath23  though even very poor convergence would not expected to yield such large interior disagreements @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present work was to resolve the above ambiguity as to what constraints might be placed on early solar mass loss by helioseismic observations , by computing models with both up - to - date input physics and high numerical precision .",
    "we considered additional observational constraints on solar mass loss ( as discussed in ",
    "[ sssec : mdotobs ] below ) , and tested a number of different initial solar masses and mass loss timescales .",
    "we also compared the effects of mass loss to the effects of other reasonable variations in the solar input parameters and input physics  these latter effects were discussed in detail in our companion paper `` our sun  iv '' @xcite .",
    "finally , we present the effects of the various mass loss cases on the solar flux reaching earth and mars as a function of time .",
    "presently , the sun is experiencing only a negligible amount of mass loss : the solar wind removes mass at a rate @xmath29  yr@xmath30 .",
    "if this mass loss rate had been constant over the last 4.5  gyr , the young sun would have been more massive by only @xmath31 .",
    "the contemporary solar wind has been observed only for a few decades , and has been found to be a highly variable phenomenon  all properties , including flux , velocity , and composition vary significantly @xcite .",
    "the lunar surface material carries the signature of the solar wind irradiation over the past several gyr ; measurements of noble gas isotopes in lunar samples suggest that the average solar wind flux over the past @xmath4  gyr was an order of magnitude higher than it is today @xcite .",
    "this implies a total solar mass loss of @xmath32 over the past 3 to 4  gyr ( the age of the oldest available lunar material ) .",
    "some older , solar - flare irradiated grains from meteorites imply an early solar flare activity about @xmath22  times that of the present sun @xcite ; the associated solar wind may have been enhanced by a similar factor of  @xmath33 , most likely during the first @xmath34  gyr of the sun s life on the main sequence @xcite , implying a total mass loss during this first 1  gyr period of as much as @xmath35 ( if the average mass loss rate throughout that period was indeed @xmath33 times the present rate of @xmath36yr@xmath30 ) .",
    "such a change in the solar mass would be sufficient to cause a significant increase in the luminosity of the young sun .    since the sun is a typical main sequence star , it is reasonable to assume that mass loss rates in the young sun would be similar to those in other young solar - type main sequence stars .",
    "there have been several attempts to measure mass loss in early main sequence stars .",
    "it is observationally a very challenging task .",
    "@xcite attempted to obtain mass loss rates for 17 young main sequence stars somewhat hotter and more massive than the sun ( a  and  f dwarfs ) , finding upper limits to the mass loss rates of @xmath37 to @xmath38/yr ; these limits are even less constraining than the highest solar mass loss rate suggested by the meteoritic and lunar data .",
    "@xcite used 3.6  cm vla observations to place more stringent upper limits of @xmath39yr@xmath30 on mass loss rates of three young main sequence stars of roughly solar mass ( @xmath40  uma , @xmath41  cet , and @xmath42  com )  as discussed in ",
    "[ ssec : mdotused ] , the largest initial solar mass that we consider , namely @xmath1 , would require early solar mass loss rates that are marginally consistent with these more stringent limits .",
    "@xcite recently obtained hst observations of ly@xmath43 absorption from the region where the stellar wind collides with the interstellar medium , using these to measure the stellar wind from the sun - like star @xmath43  cen .",
    "they found a mass loss rate roughly twice as large as that of the sun ; note that @xmath43  cen is slightly _ older _ than the sun ( with an age of @xmath44  gyr ) , as well as being very slightly more massive ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "they also found an upper limit roughly ten times lower for its cooler , less massive companion proxima cen .",
    "a similar method had earlier been used by @xcite to look at four other main sequence stars cooler and less massive than the sun ( finding stellar winds of roughly the same order of magnitude as the solar wind ) .",
    "such a method applied to young , sun - like stars holds promise for placing stringent limits on early main sequence mass loss .",
    "very recently , @xcite demonstrated that mass loss rates in gk  dwarfs ( measured using the above method ) are generally correlated with their x - ray flux ( measured by rosat , and using the hipparcos distances ) . for 7 of the 9 stars they looked at , there was a fairly tight correlation , with @xmath46 over a range of 2  orders of magnitude in @xmath47 and  @xmath48 .",
    "they then used the estimates from @xcite of the correlation of x - ray flux with rotational velocity @xmath49 and of rotational velocity with age @xmath50 to obtain the first empirically derived relation describing the mass - loss evolution of cool main - sequence stars like the sun , namely , @xmath51 .",
    "they point out that the above correlations do not really apply to very young stars ( age@xmath52  gyr ) , and assume instead that the maximum mass loss rate at early times corresponds to the maximum x - ray flux observed in sun - like stars , namely , @xmath22  times the solar value .",
    "given the sun s present mass loss rate of @xmath53yr@xmath30 , this would imply total solar mass loss of order  @xmath54 ( albeit with an uncertainty of a factor of  5 or so ) , with most of this mass loss taking place in the first fraction of a gyr of the sun s lifetime .",
    "the effects of such a mass loss law will be investigated in more detail in a future paper , but we make some rough estimates of the probable effects in   [ sec : results ] and    [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the observed depletion of lithium in the sun provides a stringent upper limit to the total solar mass loss of @xmath55 ; i.e. , the initial solar mass  @xmath56 ( 4.5  gyr ago ) is constrained to be @xmath57 @xcite . however , this is much too generous an upper limit .",
    "there are additional mechanisms that can deplete solar lithium .",
    "one mechanism , namely , pre - main - sequence lithium depletion ( during the sun s initial contraction phase ) , was taken into account in our mass - losing solar models ( for the standard sun , this depletion was a factor of  @xmath58 , as discussed below and in our companion paper `` our sun  iv '' [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "another mechanism is rotation - induced turbulent mixing , which probably is the major cause of the main - sequence lithium depletion ; however , rotation models have free parameters , and can be fitted to _",
    "any _ required amount of solar lithium depletion ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , it has been shown that mass loss can not be the major contributor to the observed lithium depletions in the young hyades cluster @xcite ; this constraint is discussed in more detail in   [ sssec : hyrest ] below .",
    "an even more stringent upper limit to the sun s initial mass is imposed by the requirement that the early earth not lose its water via a _ moist greenhouse effect _ , which would occur if the solar flux at earth were more than 10% higher than its present value @xcite  a moist greenhouse occurs when the stratosphere becomes wet , and h@xmath7o is lost through uv dissociation and the subsequent loss of hydrogen to space .",
    "this solar flux limit corresponds to an upper limit on the sun s initial mass of @xmath59 , which is the most stringent upper limit on the sun s initial mass .",
    "the only strong lower limit on @xmath56 comes from the fact that the sun is converting matter into energy and radiating it away ; @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the total energy radiated away , @xmath62  is the average solar luminosity ( including the neutrino luminosity ) @xmath63 is the @xmath64  gyr duration of the nuclear burning , @xmath65 is the amount of mass converted into energy , and @xmath66  is the speed of light ( note that elsewhere in the paper we use `` @xmath66 '' to denote the adiabatic sound speed ) . at present , mass is radiated away as photons and neutrinos at a rate slightly over twice the solar wind mass loss rate . for the standard solar model , the sun s average luminosity over the last 4.5  gyr was about 0.85 times its present luminosity .",
    "it follows that @xmath67 from radiation losses alone ( i.e. , that @xmath68 ) .",
    "such a minor amount of mass loss has a negligible effect on the early solar luminosity .",
    "there are also considerations that put soft lower limits on the sun s initial mass  @xmath56 .",
    "if the present observed solar wind rate of @xmath29/yr had been constant over the sun s history , the total amount of solar wind mass loss would have been only @xmath69 ; including the @xmath67 from radiation losses would imply @xmath70 . however , measurements of the noble gases implanted in lunar samples suggest an average solar wind flux over the past @xmath4  gyr an order of magnitude higher than at present , @xcite , implying a total solar mass loss over that period of  @xmath71 , i.e. , a solar mass 3  gyr ago of  @xmath72  note that @xmath73 is used to refer to the solar mass at @xmath74  years before the present . the @xmath4  gyr age of these lunar rocks means that they place no limits on _ earlier _ solar mass loss , so that all one can say is that @xmath75 .",
    "older , solar - flare irradiated grains from meteorites imply early solar flare activity about @xmath22  times that of the present sun @xcite , which might possibly correspond to similarly high mass loss rates during the first @xmath34  gyr period of the sun s life , but can not be used to provide any sort of limit . the semi - empirical mass loss formula recently presented by @xcite suggests total solar mass loss of order  @xmath54 , but with an uncertainty of about a factor of  5 , as discussed above .",
    "another limit on the sun s initial mass comes from the requirement that mars was warm enough for liquid water to exist 3.8  gyr ago ( at the end of the late heavy bombardment period ) . according to @xcite and @xcite , this requires a solar flux ( at mars ) 3.8  gyr ago at least 13% larger than that from the standard solar model , in order to make it possible for a co@xmath7 greenhouse effect on mars to be able raise the temperature to  @xmath76c .",
    "such an increase in flux would correspond to a mass of the sun at that time of @xmath77 .",
    "since the lunar rock measurements constrain the sun s mass @xmath4  gyr ago to be @xmath72 , the sun s average mass loss rate between 3.8 and 3  gyr ago would be @xmath78/yr .",
    "if this same mass loss rate also occurred throughout the period from the sun s birth @xmath79  gyr ago until 3.8  gyr ago , this would imply an initial solar mass of @xmath80 .",
    "note that this lower limit assumes that the only greenhouse effect on early mars is due to  co@xmath7 .",
    "if a smog - shielded ammonia greenhouse could exist on early mars , such as that proposed for the early earth by @xcite , then this lower limit on  @xmath56 might be softened or eliminated .",
    "@xcite established that mass loss could not be the _ major _ cause of the main - sequence lithium depletion for stars in the hyades cluster .",
    "their result has frequently been mis - quoted and misunderstood ; it has often been used to rule out the possibility of mass loss during the sun s early main sequence phase . however",
    ", their result does _ not _ rule out relatively small amounts of mass loss for either the hyades or the sun .    for the hyades cluster , which is 0.6  gyr old , lithium abundances in many stars",
    "have been observed , exhibiting a fairly tight relationship between a star s lithium abundance and its surface temperature  the observed lithium abundance drops off steeply with decreasing surface temperature , below @xmath81  k. @xcite considered lithium depletion due both to pre - main - sequence burning and to main sequence mass loss .",
    "they found that the observed lithium - temperature relationship could not be accounted for by pre - main - sequence lithium depletion alone , but that it could be accounted for fairly well if one added main sequence mass loss .",
    "however , they found that all the stars with surface temperatures below 5500  k would then have to have nearly identical initial masses ( with a wide range of mass loss rates ) .",
    "such a distribution of initial stellar masses , with a high , narrow peak in the distribution near @xmath82 , is unrealistic .",
    "this argument has been widely misquoted , to rule out early main sequence mass loss in stars ( including the sun ) .",
    "the swenson - faulkner conclusion applies _ only _ if one is trying to match the hyades lithium depletions _ without including rotation - induced mixing_. as soon as one includes the latter as a major component , one can reproduce the observed lithium - temperature relation of hyades stars by choosing suitable values for the adjustable parameters in the rotational mixing formalism ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "stellar rotation is ubiquitous in young stars , and is commonly assumed to be the cause of all main sequence lithium depletion ; the presence of a relatively small amount of mass loss merely requires that the large lithium depletion due to rotation be decreased by a small amount ( by small changes in the adjustable parameters for rotational mixing ) . for the hyades , even a mass loss as large as @xmath83 in a star near @xmath84 would imply a lithium depletion factor due to mass loss alone of only  @xmath44 , ( according to the models of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and would still require a depletion factor due to rotational mixing of  @xmath85 in order to reproduce the observed lithium - temperature relation . for the sun , pre - main sequence burning yields a lithium depletion factor of order  20 @xcite ; as discussed in   [ sssec : lithium ] , combining pre - main sequence lithium burning with an early solar mass loss of @xmath83 increases this by less than a factor of  2 , i.e. , a combined lithium depletion factor of  @xmath86 , still much smaller than the total observed lithium depletion of  @xmath87 @xcite",
    "rotation would be responsible for the remaining lithium depletion .",
    "mass loss of order @xmath83 or less _ is consistent _ with the hyades lithium observations , i.e. , does not require an unrealistic initial stellar mass distribution .    in their later work ,",
    "@xcite found they were able to reproduce the hyades lithium - temperature relation by pre - main - sequence depletion alone , provided that the oxygen abundance was assumed to be at the upper limit of the observed range ( and using the most up - to - date opal and alexander opacities ) .",
    "however , other clusters such as ngc  752 , m67 , or ngc  188 _ can not _ be explained via pre - main - sequence lithium depletion alone  their observed lithium depletions are much _ larger _ than those of the hyades ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while their pre - main - sequence depletions would be significantly _ smaller _ ( due to their lower metallicities ) . the same is true of the sun . in other words , the observed lithium depletions demand main sequence depletion , which would be largely due to rotation - induced mixing , with possibly a small effect from mass loss as well .",
    "we computed mass - losing solar models having initial masses  @xmath0 , 1.02 , 1.03 , 1.04 , 1.05 , 1.06 , and  @xmath1 ; as discussed in  ",
    "[ sssec : mdotobs ] , an initial mass of  @xmath1 is the upper limit consistent with the requirement that the young earth not lose its water via a moist greenhouse effect @xcite .",
    "we considered three different forms for early solar mass loss , which we call `` exponential , '' `` step - function , '' and `` linear '' ; for each of these , two limiting cases are displayed in figure  [ fig : mdot ] ( i.e. , cases with initial solar masses of 1.01 and @xmath88 ) .    in the `` exponential '' mass loss case ,",
    "the mass loss rate starts out high and declines exponentially , with an initial mass loss rate  @xmath89 and decay time constant  @xmath90 chosen such as to give the present observed solar mass loss rate of @xmath91yr@xmath30 at the sun s present age .",
    "in other words , @xmath92 , with @xmath93 to @xmath94yr@xmath30 and @xmath95 to 0.551  gyr , for initial solar masses of 1.01 to @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "this exponential mass loss case is our most conservative one : a simple mass loss scenario that is still reasonably consistent with the observed lunar mass loss constraint .",
    "this scenario yields average mass loss rates over the past 3  gyr of 13 to  42 times the present value , for initial solar masses of 1.01 to @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "these average mass loss values are reasonably consistent with measurements of noble gases in lunar rocks , which suggest a mass loss rate an order - of - magnitude higher than the present value .",
    "since figure  [ fig : mdot ] is a log - linear plot , these `` exponential '' mass loss cases appear as straight lines .",
    "the `` step - function '' mass loss rate was chosen to have a constant high value during the period before the lunar rock observations apply , namely , the first 1.6  gyr of the sun s life ; over the remaining 3  gyr of the sun s life ( up to the present ) , a mass loss rate averaging ten times the present value was assumed , declining linearly over this period to reach the present solar mass loss rate at the present solar age .",
    "this is the most extreme case which is still consistent with the observed lunar rock mass loss constraints : it keeps the solar flux as high as possible for as long as possible . for the first 1.6  gyr , this scenario has constant mass loss rates of @xmath96 to @xmath97yr@xmath30 , for initial solar masses of 1.01 to @xmath88 , respectively .    in the `` linear '' mass loss case ,",
    "the mass loss rate starts out high and declines slowly and linearly , to reach the present solar mass loss rate at the present solar age .",
    "this was chosen as our most radical case , with maximum impact on the sun s internal structure .",
    "due to the linear decline , the mass loss rate remains high throughout most of the sun s lifetime , remaining of the same order as the initial mass loss rate ( @xmath98 to @xmath99yr@xmath30 , for initial solar masses of 1.01 to @xmath88 , respectively ) . during the past 3  gyr ,",
    "the mass loss rate for this `` linear '' case is much higher than for the other mass loss cases above , violating the observed lunar mass loss constraints ( the `` linear '' case has average mass loss rates over the past 3  gyr of 50 to  330 times the present rate , for initial solar masses of 1.01 to @xmath88 , respectively ) .",

    "nonetheless , over a reasonable model timestep , such mass loss would cause a mass layer near the solar surface to move outwards significantly .",

    "in other words , for the early earth , a smog - shielded ammonia greenhouse is a viable solution to the `` weak sun paradox '' under certain conditions , but fails under others .",
    "as discussed above , it is not clear whether the greenhouse effect could suffice to warm the early earth .",
    "a bright young sun , with stronger illumination of the young earth than from the standard solar model , would require a less extreme early greenhouse effect to prevent the early earth from freezing over .      for mars , there are also indications of higher surface temperatures in the past , that are even harder to explain by a greenhouse effect .",
    "there is evidence of large scale flow of liquid water @xmath178  gyr ago , from the drainage channels and valley networks visible on the heavily cratered ancient surface of mars @xcite ; there is some evidence for lakes @xcite , and possibly even oceans 3 to 4  gyr ago @xcite .",
    "even if the channels were formed by subsurface sapping of groundwater , martian surface temperatures significantly higher than today would have been required for liquid water to be present near the surface ; if the suggested evidence of glacial markings were confirmed , this would require temperatures high enough for precipitation to occur @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that there is an upper limit to the greenhouse warming of mars that is possible from co@xmath7 .",
    "he showed that the maximum possible greenhouse warming occurs at a martian surface co@xmath7 pressure of 5  bars  with more co@xmath7 , the added greenhouse warming is outweighed by the cooling effects of increased co@xmath7 condensation in the upper martian atmosphere .",
    "he demonstrated that the requirement of liquid water on mars , i.e. , a surface temperature of at least  @xmath194k , demands a solar flux value @xmath195 ( where @xmath196 is the solar flux relative to its present value ) , even with the most favorable greenhouse warming case of a co@xmath7 pressure of 5  bars . at 3.8  gyr ago , when liquid water is thought to have existed on mars , the standard solar model yields a value of @xmath197 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : solarflux ] ) , totally insufficient relative to kasting s minimum value of  0.86 .",
    "@xcite states that the uncertainties in his martian climate model might push the limiting value of  @xmath196 from 0.86 down to  0.80 ( albeit for an unreasonably low martian albedo ) , but even this lower @xmath196 requirement is incompatible with the standard solar model .",
    "the standard solar model does not reach this extreme limit of @xmath198 until 2.9  gyr ago , and reaches @xmath199 later still , at 1.9  gyr ago ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : solarflux ] )  in either case , far too late to account for liquid water on mars 3.8  gyr ago . with co@xmath7 pressures either lower or higher than 5  bar",
    ", @xcite shows that even higher solar flux values would be required to yield liquid water .",
    "he presents the solar flux required to obtain liquid water as a function of the co@xmath7 pressure : e.g. , a pressure of 3  bar would require @xmath200 , and a pressure of 10  bar would require @xmath201 .",
    "the standard solar model is totally incapable of yielding such high fluxes 3.8  gyr ago ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : solarflux ] ) .",
    "in other words , for a standard solar model , co@xmath7 greenhouse warming can not under any circumstances yield liquid water on early mars .",
    "a preliminary study by @xcite suggested the possibility that relatively small amounts of atmospheric so@xmath7 ( @xmath202bar ) might have served as a powerful source of heating in the upper atmosphere of early mars ( due to its strong absorption in the near  uv ) , which might have been sufficient to prevent the condensation of co@xmath7 ( though they noted that so@xmath7 in the presence of liquid water would produce h@xmath7so@xmath191 , which would lead to some countervailing cooling ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out a more important effect of the h@xmath7so@xmath191 : even @xmath203bar of so@xmath7 in the martian atmosphere , 4  orders of magnitude less than proposed by @xcite , would result in a ph acidic enough to attack solid rocks and precipitate gypsum ( caso@xmath191 * 2h@xmath7o ) , removing the so@xmath7 from the atmosphere .    some temperature increase on early mars",
    "is expected from geothermal heating @xcite , but by itself it is insufficient @xcite .",
    "with the above greenhouse and geothermal heating apparently incapable of yielding liquid water on early mars , given the illumination from a standard solar model , let us consider the possibility of a non - standard , brighter young sun .",
    "figure  [ fig : solarflux ] presents the relative flux values  @xmath196 throughout the sun s past history yielded by our mass - losing solar models with initial masses from @xmath0 to  @xmath1 ( as well as that from a standard solar model ) .",
    "the requirement that the early earth not lose its water via a moist greenhouse effect leads to an upper limit of  @xmath204 , corresponding to the upper edge of the figures .",
    "the lower luminosity constraints from the requirement that liquid water be present 3.8  gyr ago on early mars are shown by the vertical arrows ; the heavy double arrow corresponds to the limit @xmath195 obtained by @xcite , and the lighter single arrow to his extreme ( less probable ) limit @xmath205 .    figure  [ fig : solarflux]a presents the solar flux  @xmath196 at earth and mars ( relative to their present flux ) from the time of solar system formation until the present , for our `` exponential '' mass loss cases ; the flux for the standard solar model ( without mass loss ) is also shown , by the solid line .",
    "note that the mass loss time scale is between 0.755 and 0.551  gyr , with initial mass loss rates from @xmath206 to @xmath94yr@xmath30 , for initial masses from 1.01 to @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the exponential decline as a function of time of these mass loss rates means that they are generally consistent with the observations of @xmath40  uma , @xmath41  cet , and @xmath42  com presented by @xcite , who obtained upper limits of @xmath207 , @xmath208 , and @xmath209yr@xmath30 , respectively , for the mass loss rates of these three young sun - like stars ( note that the @xmath141 case is only marginally consistent , lying very slightly above the @xmath40  uma limit : see fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot ] ) .",
    "our results demonstrate that , for the `` exponential '' mass loss cases , the @xmath2 case  and only this case  is marginally consistent with the @xcite mars flux requirement @xmath210 at an age of @xmath178  gyr ago ; if the martian surface co@xmath7 pressure 3.8  gyr ago was either much lower or much higher than 5  bar , even the @xmath2 case would be ruled out .",
    "( if the unlikely extreme kasting flux limit of @xmath211 is used , initial masses @xmath212 would be permissible for a co@xmath7 pressure of 5 bars , and the @xmath2 case would be marginally compatible with pressures between @xmath4 and  @xmath213 bar . )",
    "since the semi - empirical mass loss law @xmath51 recently presented by @xcite is strongly peaked at early times ( as discussed in   [ sssec : mdotobs ] ) , it tends to yield a relatively small solar mass @xmath178  gyr ago .",
    "a @xmath150 mass loss relation , normalized by the present solar mass loss rate , would yield @xmath214gyr@xmath215 ; by tweaking parameters to their extreme limits , one might obtain @xmath214gyr@xmath216 . comparing the flux relations in figure  [ fig : solarflux ] with the solar mass as a function of time in figure  [ fig : helio ] , one can estimate that a solar mass of @xmath214gyr@xmath217 is needed in order to satisfy the @xcite mars flux requirement @xmath218gyr@xmath219 .",
    "thus the mass loss formula of @xcite might possibly be capable of satisfying the mars flux requirement .",
    "this possibility will be tested in a future paper .",
    "figure  [ fig : solarflux]b presents the extreme `` step - function '' mass loss case .",
    "this case has a constant mass loss rate for the first 1.6  gyr ( @xmath96 to @xmath97yr@xmath30 , for initial solar masses of 1.01 to @xmath88 , respectively ) , and a low mass loss rate thereafter .",
    "these mass loss rates are all consistent with the stellar mass loss observations of @xcite for @xmath40  uma , @xmath41  cet , and @xmath42  com quoted above .",
    "these `` step - function '' cases have a longer mass loss timescale than the `` exponential '' one , and thus yield a higher solar flux for the first 1.6  gyr .",
    "( due to the way the `` step - function '' cases were defined , after the first 1.6  gyr their solar flux is very close to that of the standard solar model . )",
    "our results demonstrate that , for this extreme `` step - function '' mass loss case , initial masses @xmath220 are capable of yielding liquid water on mars until 3.8  gyr ago",
    ".    figure  [ fig : solarflux]c similarly presents the radical `` linear '' mass loss case .",
    "this case has a high initial mass loss rate ( @xmath221 to @xmath99yr@xmath30 , for initial solar masses of 1.01 to @xmath88 , respectively ) , which remains relatively high throughout much of the sun s lifetime ( since it declines linearly with time to reach the present solar mass loss rate at the present time ) .",
    "these mass loss cases are consistent with the stellar mass loss observations of @xcite for @xmath40  uma , @xmath41  cet , and @xmath42  com quoted above . however , they are _ not _ consistent with the lunar rock observations of the solar wind over the past 3  gyr , violating this latter constraint by an order of magnitude .",
    "our results demonstrate that , for this radical `` linear '' mass loss case , initial masses @xmath212 are capable of yielding liquid water on mars until 3.8  gyr ago .",
    "the lower end of this range is mildly ( but not significantly ) favored by the helioseismology ; note that such cases with @xmath222 have remarkably constant solar flux over the first 3  gyr .",
    "a mass - losing solar model will always be brighter at birth than the standard solar model , since the luminosity  @xmath223 at the zero age main sequence ( zams ) is roughly proportional to the mass to the fourth power ( @xmath224 ) . for a mass - losing sun",
    ", the orbital radii of the planets varies inversely with the solar mass ( @xmath225 , due to conservation of angular momentum ) ; the initial flux at the planets is thus proportional to the sixth power of the initial solar mass ( @xmath226 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : solarflux ] illustrates the solar flux at the planets as a function of time , demonstrating how much higher the early solar flux at the planets is in the mass - losing cases than in the standard ( non - mass - losing ) model .    for clarity , only the flux for our `` preferred '' initial masses for each type of mass loss",
    "are illustrated in figure  [ fig : prefflux ] .",
    "our preferred `` exponential '' case ( with @xmath141 ) predicts a solar flux at the planets about 5% higher at birth than at present , considerably higher than that indicated by the standard solar model ( which predicts a flux 29% lower than at present ) . at 3.8  gyr",
    "ago , the flux for our `` exponential '' case would have been only 16% lower than at present ( cf .",
    "25% for the standard model ) . for our preferred `` step - function '' case ( with @xmath227 ) , the flux at the planets would have been only 10% lower at birth than at present ( cf .",
    "29% for the standard model ) ; at 3.8  gyr ago , the flux would have been only 14% lower than at present ( cf .",
    "25% for the standard model ) .",
    "for these `` exponential '' and `` step - function '' cases , the flux at the planets for the past 3  billion years would be essentially the same as that predicted by the standard solar model . our radical `` linear '' case ( with @xmath227 )",
    "would have had an almost constant solar flux at the planets for the first 3  gyr , namely , only 11% lower than at present ( cf .",
    "29% to 12% lower for the standard model ) ; for this case , the flux would be close to that predicted by the standard solar model only during the last billion years .",
    "figure  [ fig : hrd ] presents the evolution in the hr  diagram of our preferred exponential and step - function mass - losing cases ( heavy dashed and dot - dashed curves , respectively ) ; these cases are in agreement with the helioseismic observations , with the existence of water on early mars , and with the lunar rock observations of solar mass loss .",
    "( a radical linear case , agreeing with the first two of these constraints but disagreeing with the third one , is shown by the light dotted curve . ) for comparison , the standard solar model is also displayed ( solid line ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : hrd ] illustrates that the early evolution of mass - losing solar models is in the opposite direction in the hr  diagram to the standard solar model : the mass - losing models initially become less luminous and slightly redder ( instead of more luminous and slightly bluer ) . figure  [",
    "fig : hrd ] also illustrates that in the past , the sun s surface temperature changed only by negligible amounts ( 1  or  2% ) , both for the standard and the mass losing cases , in contrast to the relatively large changes in the luminosity .",
    "a slightly higher initial solar mass , producing a brighter young sun , turns out to be a viable explanation for warm temperatures on early earth and mars , that otherwise are difficult to account for ( particularly for mars ) . such a higher initial solar mass leaves a fingerprint on the sun s present internal structure that is large enough to be detectable in principle via helioseismic observations .",
    "our computations demonstrated that all 21 of the mass - losing solar models that we considered were consistent with the helioseismic observations ; in fact , our preferred mass - losing cases were in marginally ( though not significantly ) better agreement with the helioseismology than the standard solar model was . however ,",
    "there are still significant uncertainties in the observed solar composition and in the input physics on which the solar models are based ; these uncertainties have a slightly larger effect on the sun s present internal structure than the fingerprint left from early solar mass loss .",
    "future improvements by a factor of  2 or so in the accuracy of these input parameters could reduce the size of the uncertainties below the level of the fingerprints left by a more massive , brighter young sun , allowing one to determine whether early solar mass loss took place or not . also urgently needed are more measurements of mass loss rates from other young stars similar to the young sun , and more measurements from our solar system that can be used to estimate the solar wind in the past .",

    "<S> the relatively warm temperatures required on early earth and mars have been difficult to account for via warming from greenhouse gases . </S>",
    "<S> we tested whether this problem can be resolved for both earth and mars by a young sun that is brighter than predicted by the standard solar model ( ssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we computed high - precision solar evolutionary models with slightly increased initial masses of @xmath0 to  @xmath1 ; for each mass , we considered three different mass loss scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> we then tested whether these models were consistent with the current high - precision helioseismic observations . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively modest mass loss rates in these models are consistent with observational limits from young stars and estimates of the past solar wind obtained from lunar rocks , and do not significantly affect the solar lithium depletion . for appropriate initial masses , </S>",
    "<S> all three mass loss scenarios are capable of yielding a solar flux 3.8  gyr ago high enough to be consistent with water on ancient mars . </S>",
    "<S> the higher flux at the planets is due partly to the fact that a more massive young sun would be intrinsically more luminous , and partly to the fact that the planets would be closer to the more massive young sun . at birth on the main sequence , our preferred initial mass </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 would produce a solar flux at the planets 50% higher than that of the ssm , namely , a flux 5% _ higher _ than the present value ( rather than 30% lower , which the ssm predicts ) . at first </S>",
    "<S> ( for @xmath3  gyr ) , the solar flux would _ decrease _ ; subsequently , it would behave more like the flux in the ssm , increasing until the present . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all of our mass - losing solar models are consistent with the helioseismic observations ; in fact , our preferred mass - losing case with  @xmath2 is in marginally ( though insignificantly ) better agreement with the helioseismology than is the ssm . </S>",
    "<S> the early solar mass loss of a few percent does indeed leave a small fingerprint on the sun s internal structure </S>",
    "<S> . however , for helioseismology to significantly constrain early solar mass loss would require higher accuracy in the observed solar parameters and input physics , namely , by a factor of  @xmath4 for the observed solar surface composition , and a factor of  @xmath5 for the solar interior opacities , the @xmath6  nuclear reaction rate , and the diffusion constants for gravitational settling . </S>"
