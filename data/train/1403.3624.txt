    "this paper is concerned with schrdinger operators @xmath8 in @xmath9 with dirichlet condition at @xmath10 . in particular , we are interested in the dependence of various spectral properties of @xmath0 on the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "note that potentials of the type @xmath11 have a special role , since the resulting operator @xmath0 is scaling invariant .",
    "moreover , it is known that the potentials which satisfy @xmath12 as @xmath13 represent a borderline case for certain important spectral inequalities such as dispersive or strichartz estimates , see @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that schrdinger operators with inverse square potentials have recently attracted certain attention ; we might mention for example the heat kernel bounds obtained in @xcite , or strichartz estimates in dimension three studied in @xcite .",
    "inverse square potentials appear naturally also in connection with two - dimensional schrdinger operators with aharonov - bohm - type magnetic field , see @xcite .",
    "main objects of our interest here are the spectral density @xmath14 of @xmath0 , and the unitary group @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , we are going to study the asymptotic behavior of @xmath1 for @xmath2 and the @xmath3 dispersive estimates associated to the evolution operator @xmath4 .",
    "it is very well - known that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath1 for small @xmath15 is closely related to the asymptotic behavior of @xmath4 for large @xmath16 .",
    "there is a huge amount of literature on this subject , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "we are not going to discuss this connection any further since it will not be used in our proofs .    for general one - dimensional schrdinger operators of the type @xmath17 the behavior of both @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    "is known provided the potential @xmath6 decays fast enough at infinity . in particular ,",
    "if zero is a regular point of @xmath20 , ( which is the generic case ) , then @xmath21 in a suitable operator topology , see @xcite . accordingly , for such short range potentials , under certain regularity conditions , murata @xcite proved @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a weight function with a sufficient growth at infinity .",
    "the corresponding @xmath3 was established by schlag @xmath24 with @xmath25 , see @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that the decay conditions on @xmath6 , under which all the above results were obtained , imply that @xmath26 as @xmath27 .",
    "the goal of the present note is to show that if @xmath6 is of type @xmath28 with @xmath29 , then the asymptotic relation is no longer valid and has to replaced by a new one , and , on the other hand , the estimates and can be improved . in particular",
    "@xmath1 decays _",
    "faster _ to zero than in , see theorem [ thm-1 ] .",
    "accordingly the decay in the dispersive estimate can be improved provided the weight function @xmath30 grows fast enough at infinity , see theorem [ thm-2 ] .",
    "although our results regard a family of schrdinger operators with explicit potentials , it can be expected that similar results should hold also if @xmath0 is perturbed by a sufficiently short - range perturbation .",
    "it should be finally mentioned that our main results , i.e. theorems [ thm-1 ] and [ thm-2 ] , fail in the case of schrdinger operators on the whole line due to the presence of the zero resonance .",
    "we set @xmath31 on @xmath32 . for any @xmath33 we denote @xmath34 let @xmath35 be the space of bounded linear operators from @xmath36 to @xmath37 and let @xmath38 denote the corresponding operator norm .",
    "finally , we put @xmath39    we have    [ thm-1 ] let @xmath40 .",
    "then for any @xmath41 and any @xmath42 it holds @xmath43 in @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the integral operator in @xmath9 with the kernel @xmath46    equation shows that for positive values of @xmath5 the density @xmath1 is of lesser order than in the case of a short - range potential , see equation .",
    "for a throughout discussion of threshold expansion of resolvents of one - dimensional operators with short - range potentials we refer to @xcite .",
    "asymptotic behaviour of schrdinger groups generated by operators with inverse square decay on conical manifolds was studied in @xcite in the setting of weighted @xmath47spaces .",
    "[ thm-2 ] let @xmath48",

    "* thm.1.11 ) by considering the restriction of inequality ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq.(1.29 ) ) to radial functions . on the other hand ,",
    "the result for @xmath53 , namely the faster decay of @xmath54 in @xmath16 is new . the maximal decay rate @xmath55 , achieved by the choice @xmath56 ,",
    "should be compared with the @xmath57 decay rate in the estimate .",
    "note also that in the border - line case @xmath58 , which means @xmath59 , theorem [ thm-2 ] with the choice @xmath60 gives the decay rate @xmath61 , which is the decay rate of the free evolution @xmath62 in dimension two .",
    "this is not surprising since the operator @xmath63 in @xmath9 with dirichlet boundary condition at zero is unitarily equivalent , by means of the unitary mapping @xmath64 , to the laplacian @xmath65 in @xmath66 restricted to radial functions .",
    "an immediate consequence of theorem [ thm-2 ] is the following    let @xmath48 .",

    "hence from theorem [ thm-2 ] and we obtain @xmath77 this proves .    inequality should be compared with the estimate valid for short - range potentials .",
    "for simplicity we shall drop the index @xmath5 in the sequel and write @xmath78 instead of @xmath79 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath80 we first study the solutions @xmath81 of the generalized eigenvalue equation @xmath82 after setting @xmath83 , equation writes @xmath84 with @xmath85 . the latter is a bessel equation of the first kind , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "this follows from the identity applied to @xmath45 .",
    "hence by applying the taylor formula to the operator @xmath104 at @xmath105 we find that the claim of the lemma will follow if we show that @xmath106 where @xmath107 denotes the hilbert - schmidt norm in @xmath9 . using the recurrence relations for the derivatives of @xmath108 : @xmath109 see ( * ? ? ?",
