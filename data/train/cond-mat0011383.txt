    "one of the main characteristics of heavy - fermion systems@xcite is the competition between kondo effect and magnetic long - range order,@xcite both stemming from the local antiferromagnetic ( kondo ) coupling between localized moments and conduction - electron spins .",
    "the non - magnetic compounds , like ceal@xmath3 , present a low - temperature state resembling a fermi liquid with enhanced carrier mass , the so called heavy - fermion regime .",
    "in addition to that , superconductivity is observed below @xmath4k in some systems,@xcite the best known being cecu@xmath5si@xmath5 , ube@xmath6 , and upt@xmath3 .",
    "although the nature of superconductivity in these systems is still unclear , it has been suggested that the kondo interaction itself might provide a pairing mechanism.@xcite indeed , there is experimental evidence that heavy electrons are involved in the superconducting state , as a high value is observed for the specific - heat jump at the superconducting transition .",
    "lately , the competition between kondo effect and magnetism has been studied in a mean - field approximation based on a simple decoupling of the kondo exchange term,@xcite but superconductivity has not been studied within a similar approach . if fluctuations are not included , this mean - field approximation is equivalent to considering only part of the terms of an unrestricted hartree - fock ( hf ) decoupling of the exchange interaction . in this work",
    ", we include all relevant terms in this hf decoupling . among them , a singlet",
    "pairing coupling appears , which we treat in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) approximation , leading to superconductivity in the model .",
    "although there are experimental grounds to the notion that superconductivity in heavy - fermion systems presents non - trivial symmetry properties,@xcite and can even coexist with magnetic ordering , it is instructive to explore , in a simple theoretical approach , the existence of a superconducting solution in which the pairing mechanism is the same local kondo interaction that is also responsible for magnetic ordering and compensation of local moments .",
    "we consider the standard kondo - lattice model used to describe heavy - fermion systems , writing the hamiltonian in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 creates a conduction electron with spin @xmath9 at site @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the localized ( conduction ) spin operator at site @xmath10 .",
    "the hf - bcs approximation has been described before , @xcite and has been used , for example , to study @xmath13-wave superconductivity in a generalized hubbard model,@xcite with results which are in qualitative agreement with exact diagonalization of finite systems.@xcite we use a fermionic representation of the localized spins , assigning them to @xmath14 electrons , whose occupation number is restricted to one per site .",
    "then , neglecting expectation values which do not conserve spin ( e.g , triplet pairing ) , the unrestricted hf decoupling of the interaction term reads    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    @xmath15    2 where @xmath16 .",
    "the constraint of one localized ( @xmath14 ) particle per site is taken only on average , i.e. , @xmath17 @xmath18 being the number of sites , and is imposed by adding to the hamiltonian the term @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a lagrange multiplier .",
    "this procedure reduces the hamiltonian to an effective one - body problem .    in the following we consider only the non - magnetic homogeneous solution with singlet superconductivity",
    "the order parameters are @xmath21 , characterizing the singlet kondo state,@xcite and @xmath22 , which is the usual superconducting order parameter .",
    "both can be made real through a gauge transformation .    in absence of superconductivity ( @xmath23 ) , the problem is easily solved .",
    "the electronic structure of @xmath24 is composed of two hybrid bands with energies @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the dispersion relation of the unperturbed conduction band , and @xmath27 both , @xmath20 and @xmath28 must be determined selfconsistently .",
    "the latter shows the usual behavior of a mean - field order parameter as a function of temperature , going to zero at a critical temperature which we identify as the ( mean - field ) kondo temperature @xmath1 . in the limit @xmath29 ,",
    "the self consistent conditions lead to a simple equation for @xmath1 : @xmath30 the chemical potential @xmath31 in this limit is determined by the number of conduction electrons of the unperturbed band , @xmath32 with @xmath33 standing for the fermi function , and @xmath34 being the unperturbed density of states ( dos ) per spin . in the following we take , for simplicity , a parabolic dos , @xmath35 , choosing the half band width of the unperturbed band as the unit of energy .    since @xmath36 is electron - hole symmetric , we can assume , without loss of generality , @xmath37 , so that the fermi level falls in the lower hybrid band .",
    "the pairing terms in @xmath36 can be written in terms of the hybrid operators describing the quasi - particles in the lower band , and we can safely neglect the upper one , as the superconducting critical temperature @xmath38 turns out to be much lower than @xmath1 .",
    "after some algebra , we arrive at the following four equations , which determine @xmath20 , @xmath28 , @xmath31 , and the superconducting critical temperature @xmath0 : @xmath39 , \\nonumber \\\\ \\lambda & = & \\frac{v}{2n}\\sum_{\\rm k}\\frac{1}{r_{\\rm k}}[f(e_{\\rm k}^{a})-f(e_{\\rm k}^{b } ) ] , \\nonumber \\\\ n_{f } & + & n_{c } = \\frac{2}{n}\\sum_{\\rm k}[f(e_{\\rm k}^{a})+f(e_{\\rm k}^{b } ) ] , \\nonumber \\\\ 1 & = & \\frac{3j_{\\rm k}v^{2}}{16n } \\sum_{\\rm k } \\frac{1}{r_{\\rm k}^{2 } ( e_{\\rm k}^{a}-\\mu ) } \\tanh \\left ( \\frac{e_{\\rm k}^{a}-\\mu } { t_{c}}\\right ) , \\label{ts}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "in fig .  1 we present @xmath43 and the superconducting critical temperature @xmath0 as a function of conduction - band filling @xmath44 for a typical value of @xmath45 .",
    "the kondo temperature @xmath46 increases with @xmath44 and has its maximum at @xmath47 ( as explained above , @xmath48 ) .",
    "instead , @xmath0 should vanish at @xmath47 because this case corresponds to a kondo insulator , with the fermi level falling in a gap whose magnitude is larger than the effective pairing interaction .",
    "in other words , while the effective pairing interaction and the density of states increase as @xmath44 tend to one , the effective number of carriers around the fermi level tends to zero . as a consequence of this competition",
    ", @xmath0 shows a maximum around @xmath490.7 , whose position is not strongly dependent on the coupling , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "assuming that the magnitude of the unperturbed half band width is of the order of 1@xmath50ev , then , for @xmath51ev we obtain @xmath52k at optimum doping ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "and superconducting critical temperature @xmath0 as a function of doping for @xmath53.,width=302 ]    2     as a function of band filling for two different values of the kondo coupling.,width=302 ]     and superconducting critical temperature @xmath38 as functions of @xmath2 for @xmath54.,width=302 ]    2    figure 3 shows @xmath1 and @xmath0 as functions of @xmath2 for @xmath54 ( near optimum doping ) .",
    "the dependence of both temperatures with @xmath2 can be fitted very well by exponential functions : @xmath55 as clearly evidenced by the logarithmic plots of fig .",
    "the meaning of the coefficients is not obvious .",
    "the parameter values used in figs .  2 and 3 yield @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . for a single kondo impurity , in the limit of infinite band width",
    ", it is known that @xmath60 $ ] , @xcite where @xmath61 is the magnitude of the unperturbed density of states , assumed constant .",
    "the natural extension to the case of a finite band width would be to write the single - impurity kondo temperature as the first of equations ( [ exp ] ) with @xmath62 , which would have the value 1.3905 for the example considered .",
    "however , in the present case the coefficients are not only affected by the finite band width but also by the mean - field approximation and the fact that we are dealing with a kondo lattice instead of a single impurity .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 with @xmath2 is even more difficult to predict . from usual bcs theory one might expect an exponential dependence on the product of the interacting density of states and the effective pairing interaction , if the latter is small",
    "this in turn , is proportional to @xmath2 and @xmath63 ( see eq.([ts ] ) ) , with a prefactor that , being generally of the order of magnitude of the band width , should vanish as @xmath64 .",
    "we have shown that the kondo - lattice model , treated within the hf bcs approximation , can lead to a superconducting phase within the kondo ( heavy - fermion ) regime , with the kondo temperature @xmath1 and superconducting critical temperature @xmath0 of the order of magnitude observed in experiments .",
    "while both temperatures depend exponentially on the exchange interaction , their doping dependences are different , and @xmath0 vanishes for a half - filled band . if one wants to make quantitative comparisons with experimental results , an appropriate choice of parameters that gives a good agreement for @xmath38 will yield a slightly overestimated @xmath1 .",
    "this is typical of a mean - field solution , and one expects the true kondo temperature to be reduced by fluctuation effects .",
    "actually , we would like to remark that @xmath65 signals a second - order phase transition in the mean - field approach , while only broad features characteristic of a crossover behavior are observed in experiments .",
    "it is interesting to notice that other approximations can be obtained if one explicitly uses the constraint @xmath66 to rewrite parts of the hamiltonian before performing the hf decoupling .",
    "for example @xmath67 ceases to be an exact equality once the first term is decoupled .",
    "the use of different approximations affect the strength of the different decoupled terms , and therefore affect the relative stability of the different phases .",
    "however , assuming that magnetic ordering does not occur , the qualitative behavior of @xmath65 and @xmath0 should be the same as in our approach .     and",
    "@xmath0 as functions of @xmath68 for @xmath54 , showing the straight lines that fit eqs .",
    "( [ exp]).,width=302 ]    we have not analyzed here the stability of our solution with respect to magnetic ordering . however , previous results@xcite have shown that within a mean - field approach one needs an explicit intersite exchange in order to obtain magnetic long - range ordering . even in that case , the non - magnetic solution should be stable for moderate or large kondo interaction @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , the possibility of obtaining a wave - vector dependent superconducting gap , as suggested by experimental results,@xcite has more to do with the model itself , as one should consider a non - local kondo interaction .",
    "the present approach can be easily extended to such a case .",
