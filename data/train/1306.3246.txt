    "in a series of papers @xcite , we have recently introduced and studied a model of three - dimensional gravity that has proven to be very useful to understand some of the fundamental features of canonical loop quantum gravity and spin foam models .",
    "this new formulation of gravity in three dimensions is particularly interesting because it admits a barbero - immirzi parameter , and can be written as a holst or a plebanski action . as such",
    ", it can be used to study the imposition of the simplicity constraints in the construction of spin foam models , the role of @xmath1 and of the @xmath0 ashtekar - barbero formulation , and the relation with the self - dual variables . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that this lorentzian three - dimensional model can be written at the hamiltonian level in terms of @xmath0 canonical variables ( just like in the four - dimensional case ) , which leads to discrete and @xmath1-dependent geometrical operators . however , it turns out to be possible to simplify the hamiltonian constraint ( and write it as a flatness constraint ) by working with complex canonical variables , provided that one imposes simplicity - like conditions ensuring that the corresponding connection be @xmath2-valued . in terms of these new variables ,",
    "the spectra of the geometric operators become continuous and @xmath1-independent .    in four - dimensional loop quantum gravity , the discreteness of quantum geometry at the planck scale , together with the existence of a non - zero minimal eigenvalue for the area operator , play a crucial role in the loop quantum cosmology scenario of singularity resolution @xcite and are essential for the recovery of the semi - classical thermodynamical properties of black holes @xcite . independently of the question of wether or",
    "not the geometric operators will remain discrete and @xmath1-dependent at the dynamical level , it has been argued that already at the kinematical level a different choice of connection could potentially lead to continuous and @xmath1-independent spectra @xcite .",
    "this observation has always remained at the formal level , since no hilbert space is known for the lorentz - covariant theory in terms of the shifted connection of alexandrov .",
    "it is however known that this approach is closely related to the quantization in terms of the complex self - dual ashtekar connection , a route which has been recently reconsidered in the light of results on black hole entropy @xcite and the asymptotics of spin foam models @xcite . in the absence of a known way of constructing a full quantum theory with the self - dual variables ,",
    "one is forced to investigate toy models and to focus on particular calculations such as the derivation of black hole entropy .",
    "the hope is that this will provide informations as to how the self - dual quantum theory should be built .",
    "in particular , a key open question concerns the role of the barbero - immirzi parameter and of the @xmath0 variables .",
    "are these fundamental variables of quantum gravity with @xmath1 playing a true physical role , or simply a necessary regularization procedure needed in order to deal with the non - compactness of the gauge group of lorentzian gravity ?",
    "it seems to us that the latter point of view should be adopted . in this short paper , we give an example of the above - mentioned duality between the nature of the geometric spectra ( discrete or continuous ) and the choice of connection . for this , we use the holst formulation of three - dimensional gravity to compare the quantum theories built with the @xmath3 ashtebar - barbero and the @xmath4 self - dual connection .",
    "more precisely , our starting point for this study is the observation that the three - dimensional model of interest can be obtained from a symmetry reduction of the four - dimensional holst action , defined by imposing a symmetry along an arbitrary spatial direction .",
    "fortunately , this reduction preserves the presence of @xmath1 , and the resulting theory shares most of the properties of its four - dimensional counterpart .",
    "in particular , in the time gauge , the classical dynamical variables are given by an @xmath0 ashtekar - barbero connection @xmath5 canonically conjugated to an @xmath3-valued electric field @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , the six first class constraints that generate the isometries of the locally flat space - time can be decomposed , as in four dimensions , in terms of a gauss constraint , a vectorial constraint , and a scalar constraint .",
    "since the theory is topological in three dimensions , the physical degrees of freedom are captured by the holonomies @xmath7 of the connection along the links @xmath8 of a unique graph @xmath9 ( sufficiently refined to resolve the topology of the spatial surface ) , and the `` one - dimensional fluxes '' of the electric field @xmath10 along links @xmath11 ( dual to @xmath8 ) of the dual graph @xmath12 . at the quantum level , these ( non - local ) variables are promoted to non - commutative operators which satisfy the three - dimensional analogue of the holonomy - flux algebra . as usual ,",
    "kinematical states are @xmath0 spin networks associated to the graph @xmath9 , and the geometric operators are constructed in terms of the flux operators @xmath10 .",
    "the spectrum of the length operator is given by a sum of fundamental contributions @xmath13 , where @xmath14 labels unitary irreducible representations of @xmath0 , and @xmath15 is the three - dimensional planck length .",
    "motivated by the fact that this @xmath0 hamiltonian theory should describe lorentzian three - dimensional gravity , i.e. @xmath16 bf theory , the hamiltonian constraint can be recast into the form of a flatness constraint .",
    "the canonical connection then becomes complex and @xmath4-valued , although it is defined with @xmath17 . on top of this complex formulation , it is possible to impose two types of linear simplicity conditions similar to that used in spin foam models .",
    "the first form of the constraint ( which relates the @xmath3 generators and their complement in @xmath4 ) gives back the @xmath3-valued ashtekar - barbero connection , while the second one ( which relates the @xmath2 generators and their complement in @xmath4 ) leads to an @xmath2 connection . constructing the quantum theory with the latter , we observe that the length operator is given by a sum of fundamental contributions @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 or @xmath20 depending on the regularization of the length operator ) , where @xmath21 is a real parameter labeling the continuous series of representations of @xmath16 .",
    "this spectrum is therefore continuous and @xmath1-independent .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the classical formulation that serves as the starting point for this analysis . in section [ sec:3 ] , we present the two different choices of connection that can be made at the classical level , and discuss the resulting quantum theories .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] is devoted to the introduction of the classical geometric operators , while their spectra are studied in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "let us start with the four - dimensional holst action s_[e,]=__4(_ijkle^ie^j f^kl+_ijkle^ie^jf^kl ) , and perform a spacetime symmetry reduction that keeps the internal gauge group @xmath22 unbroken . for this , we assume that the four - dimensional spacetime manifold has the topology @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a three - dimensional spacetime manifold , and @xmath25 is a spatial direction along which the theory is invariant .",
    "denoting by @xmath26 the coordinate along @xmath25 , the invariance of the basic fields can be expressed as [ symmetry conditions ] _ 3=0,_3^ij=0 . as a consequence",
    ", the resulting reduced action is given by [ 3d action ] s[e ,",
    "x,]=__3 ^ 3x^(_ijklx^ie_^jf_^kl+_ijklx^ie_^jf_^kl ) , where @xmath27 is an @xmath4-valued connection over @xmath24 , @xmath28 is an @xmath4-valued one form over @xmath24 , and @xmath29 is an @xmath4-valued scalar on @xmath24 . as usual , @xmath30 is the totally antisymmetric spacetime tensor , @xmath31 denotes the totally antisymmetric internal tensor , and @xmath32 is defined in term of the flat minkowski metric @xmath33 .",
    "we assume that @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a two - dimensional surface with no boundaries .    in order to mimic the construction of four - dimensional loop quantum gravity",
    ", we performed in @xcite the canonical analysis of the three - dimensional action ( [ 3d action ] ) in the time gauge .",
    "this gauge fixing is defined by the conditions @xmath36 , and breaks the internal gauge group @xmath22 into its maximal compact subgroup @xmath0 . just like in the four - dimensional theory",
    ", the resulting phase space is parametrized by the canonical pair @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the three - dimensional analogue of the @xmath3 ashtekar - barbero connection , and @xmath39 its conjugate electric field .",
    "these variables satisfy the poisson bracket [ poisson bracket ] \\{e^a_i(x),a_b^j(y)}=^a_b^j_i^2(x - y ) , and are subject to the following gauss , vectorial , and scalar constraints : [ constraints ] g=_ae^a+a_ae^a , h_a=_abe^bf_12,h_0=x(f_12-(1+^-2)k_1k_2 ) , where @xmath40 is the curvature of @xmath5 .",
    "the variable @xmath41 is the three - dimensional analogue of the extrinsic curvature , and can be written as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the reduced version of the four - dimensional levi - civita connection @xmath44 .",
    "its explicit expression is given by _",
    "a(e)=u_au+_abu , where @xmath45 .",
    "to finish with this brief overview of the phase space structure , let us mention that @xmath46 is colinear to @xmath47 , which makes the above expression for @xmath48 strictly similar to the scalar constraint of the four - dimensional full theory . furthermore , because the vectors @xmath49 are orthogonal to @xmath50 @xcite , the quantity @xmath51 is in the direction of @xmath50 , and @xmath52 and @xmath48 can be viewed as the component of the same vector @xmath53 defined by [ f=0 in time gauge ] h = f_12-(1+^-2)k_1k_2 .",
    "this property is in some sense responsible for the fact that this three - dimensional model is exactly soluble .",
    "we now have all the ingredients to perform the loop quantization of the theory .",
    "kinematical states are cylindrical functions of the connection associated with graphs embedded in the spatial surface @xmath35 . because of the topological nature of three - dimensional gravity , a single graph @xmath9 is sufficient to capture all the physical content of the theory . on this graph ,",
    "let us introduce the holonomies of the connection along the links @xmath57 , and the fluxes of the electric field along links @xmath58 dual to @xmath8 .",
    "these variables , i.e. @xmath59 are the building blocks of the three - dimensional ( classical and quantum ) holonomy - flux algebra",
    ". the action of the flux operator on the holonomies evaluated in the spin-@xmath14 representation of @xmath3 is given by [ actionofl ] x^i_^*^(j)(h_(a))=_,^(j)(h_c(a ) ) , where @xmath60 is the index between @xmath8 and @xmath11 , the point @xmath61 denotes the intersection @xmath62 , and @xmath63 denotes the spin-@xmath14 representation matrix associated to the @xmath64-dimensional vector space @xmath65 .",
    "the elements @xmath66 generate the lie algebra @xmath3 and satisfy , by convention , the lie algebra commutation relations @xmath67=\\eps_{ij}^{~~k } j_k$ ] , where @xmath68 is the totally antisymmetric tensor with @xmath69 , and indices are lowered and raised with the flat euclidean metric @xmath70 . as usual ,",
    "cylindrical functions associated to the graph @xmath9 form the kinematical hilbert space where the scalar product is constructed from the @xmath0 haar measure .      in principle , physical states and observables should be constructed by solving the quantum constraint @xmath71 . in this set of constraints ,",
    "only the imposition of the scalar constraint @xmath72 is problematic since the vectorial constraint @xmath73 imposing spatial diffeomorphism invariance has already been solved implicitly by fixing the graph @xmath9 .",
    "the difficulty in solving @xmath72 is essentially the same as in the four - dimensional theory , and requires an appropriate regularization of the term @xmath51 when written in terms of the non - linear expression @xmath43 .",
    "this difficulty can however be bypassed by noticing that in this three - dimensional model the constraints @xmath71 given by ( [ f=0 in time gauge ] ) can be written in the form of the flatness constraint of a bf theory .",
    "more precisely , one can look for a connection @xmath74 for which @xmath71 is equivalent to @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the curvature of @xmath74 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , up to gauge transformations , there are only two connections that satisfy this requirement .",
    "these are the self - dual and anti self - dual components of the initial @xmath22 connection @xmath77 .",
    "the connection @xmath74 is therefore complex and has to be interpreted as an @xmath4-valued connection .",
    "therefore , we have somehow traded the problem of dealing with the complicated hamiltonian constraint ( [ f=0 in time gauge ] ) for that of imposing the reality conditions . the same fact is obviously true in four dimensions , where one can take @xmath78 to obtain the self - dual scalar constraint , at the expense of working with the complex ashtekar connection .",
    "we arrive at the conclusion that the quantum dynamics can in principle be solved in terms of the connection @xmath74 , since with this variable the hamiltonian constraint is manageable .",
    "this means that one should consider @xmath22 spin network states instead of the standard @xmath0 ones , which introduces numerous technical problems due to the non - compactness of the lorentz group .",
    "a priori , such spin network states require a regularization in order to be well - defined . fortunately ,",
    "as we are about to see , this problem does drastically simplify due to the constraints satisfied by the complex connection @xmath74 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the connection @xmath74 can be written in the form [ decomposition of a ] = + , where @xmath66 are the @xmath3 generators introduces above , and @xmath79 are the boost generators satisfying the standard @xmath4 commutation relations .",
    "one can see from this expression that @xmath74 possesses two different parts , which are the two terms between the square brackets .",
    "interestingly , while the first term has no direct algebraic interpretation , the second term defines an @xmath2 component .",
    "indeed , it can easily be shown that the elements @xmath80 and the two independent components of @xmath81 generate the lie algebra @xmath2 .",
    "now , one can use the fact that there exists another legitimate choice of gauge for the action ( [ 3d action ] ) . indeed , in the gauge @xmath82 , the action ( [ 3d action ] ) reduces to that of @xmath16 bf theory , which is in complete agreement with the fact that it describes lorentzian three - dimensional gravity .",
    "for this reason , consistency of the theory in the time gauge requires that we impose that the connection @xmath74 be @xmath2-valued as well .",
    "this requirement can be met if the first term in ( [ decomposition of a ] ) is vanishing , which leads to the constraint @xmath83 .",
    "this simplicity - like constraint is equivalent to a reality condition , in the sense that it selects a real section of @xmath22 corresponding to its non - compact subgroup @xmath16 .",
    "once it is imposed at the classical level , the linear simplicity constraint reduces the connection ( [ decomposition of a ] ) to the following @xmath2 connection : [ cal a ] = ^-1(a^1f_1+a^2f_2-a^3f_0 ) , where @xmath84 are the components of the initial ashtekar - barbero connection @xmath5 expressed in the basis @xmath85 , and the family @xmath86 generates @xmath2 with the commutation relations = f_0,=f_1,=-f_2 .",
    "these generators are related by @xmath87 .",
    "now that the @xmath2 connection ( [ cal a ] ) is defined , one can in principle construct the physical hilbert space by imposing the quantum @xmath16 flatness constraint .",
    "physical states are @xmath16 spin networks with support on the graph @xmath9 .",
    "this defines the vector space structure of the physical hilbert space , and it remains to define the scalar product between the states and eventually to eliminate the zero - norm states .",
    "in order to do so , it is much simpler to choose @xmath9 to be a minimal graph . when the spatial slice @xmath35 is a riemann surface of genus @xmath88 with no boundaries , the minimal graph consists in only one vertex @xmath89 and @xmath90 loops @xmath91 starting and ending at @xmath89 .",
    "the loops @xmath92 , with @xmath93 , are the non - contractible loops around the handles of @xmath35 , and they can be identified with the standard generators of the fundamental group @xmath94 of the surface . for obvious reasons , such a minimal graph is called a flower graph .",
    "physical states are then totally defined by complex - valued functions @xmath95 on @xmath96 , where the coset by @xmath16 traduces the gauge - invariance at the unique vertex @xmath89 of @xmath9 , and the physical inner product between two such states is formally defined by [ physical product ] _ 1,_2=(a , b)([a , b])_2(a , b ) , where @xmath97 is a `` regularized '' measure on @xmath98 , @xmath99 is the dirac distribution on @xmath16 , and the commutator is @xmath100=\\prod_{i=1}^g a_ib_ia_i^{-1}b_i^{-1}$ ] . for simplicity ,",
    "we have identified here the states with the corresponding funtions on @xmath98 . at this point ,",
    "the physical scalar product and the physical hilbert space are defined only at the formal level , but we will make this construction concrete and explicit later on in the case of the torus .",
    "to finish , let us recall that the physical scalar product ( [ physical product ] ) should reproduce the lorentzian ponzano - regge amplitudes @xcite , just like it is the case for the euclidean signature @xcite .",
    "we now introduce the three - dimensional length and area operators . for this",
    ", we first define the four - dimensional area and volume operators , and then reduce them with the symmetry ( [ symmetry conditions ] ) .",
    "recall that in four spacetime dimensions the hamiltonian theory is written assuming that @xmath101 .",
    "the area @xmath102 and volume @xmath103 operators are then defined on the spatial slice @xmath104 , and measure the area and the volume of a surface @xmath105 and a region @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "the classical expressions for the area @xmath102 of a surface @xmath107 of normal @xmath108 , and the volume @xmath103 of a bounded region @xmath109 , depend only on the electric field @xmath110 , with @xmath111 , and are given by [ a and v in 4d ] _ 4(s)=_s^2x,_4(r)=_r^3x .",
    "notice that for @xmath112 , @xmath113 coincides with the electric field ( [ poisson bracket ] ) of the three - dimensional action ( [ 3d action ] ) , and is given by @xmath114 , whereas for @xmath115 we have @xmath116 .",
    "the compactification that we have used to obtain the three - dimensional holst action is of the type @xmath23 .",
    "since we have further assumed that @xmath34 in order to perform the canonical analysis , we can write that _",
    "4=_3=_3 ^ 1=_2 ^ 1 .",
    "in other words , the spatial slice @xmath104 on which the operators ( [ a and v in 4d ] ) are defined is given by @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , the surface @xmath105 measured by @xmath102 can be of two types , as represented in figure [ operators ]",
    ". it can either be of the form @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is a path ( i.e. a one - dimensional submanifold ) in @xmath35 and @xmath120 a segment in @xmath25 , or it can be a two - dimensional submanifold of @xmath35 .     and representation of the two types of surfaces that can be embedded in @xmath104 . the surface",

    "the length operator on @xmath35 can be derived from the area operator @xmath124 on @xmath104 , while the area operator on @xmath35 can be derived from the volume operator @xmath103 on @xmath104 . ]",

    ", @xmath108 is necessarily in the third direction , i.e. @xmath132 and @xmath133 , and the expression @xmath102 for the area reduces to ( s)=_s^2x , which can be expressed in terms of the triad field since @xmath116 . to write this expression in terms of the electric field",
    "@xmath134 only , we use a symmetry of the action ( [ 3d action ] ) described in @xcite , which states that @xmath46 can be chosen to be of unit norm ( @xmath135 ) , and that it is orthogonal to @xmath136 ( i.e. @xmath137 ) .",
    "if we make this choice , then the area takes the simple form [ 3d area ] ( s)=_s^2x=_s^2x .",

    "notice that we could have derived the expression for the area operator @xmath138 of the three - dimensional theory by considering the volume operator @xmath103 defined for a region @xmath109 of the type @xmath140 , where @xmath107 is a surface in @xmath35 and @xmath120 a segment of length @xmath125 in @xmath25 ( see figure [ operators ] ) .",
    "indeed , for such a region we have @xmath141 , and one can then directly obtain ( [ 3d area ] ) .    now that we have derived the classical expressions for the geometric operators of the three - dimensional theory ( that are defined on the two - dimensional surface @xmath35 ) , we can quantize them and study their action on the above - defined @xmath0 and @xmath16 states . as it is the case for the four - dimensional volume operator @xmath103 , the three - dimensional area operator @xmath138 requires a regularization in order to be well - defined in terms of the quantum flux operators @xmath142 @xcite .",

    "let us make some important remarks .    1 .",
    "first , we would like to emphasize that , in addition to being continuous , the length spectrum becomes also independent of the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the reason is simple and comes from the overall factor of @xmath156 in the expression ( [ cal a ] ) for @xmath74 , which cancels with the factor of @xmath1 coming from the poisson bracket ( [ poisson bracket ] ) when computing the action of @xmath142 on @xmath157 , i.e. as to be understood with @xmath158 , while for @xmath66 we have @xmath159 . ]",
    "x^i_^*^(s)(g_ ( ) ) = ( -)(^-1)_,^(s)(g_c ( ) ) , where @xmath160 is equal to @xmath161 when one acts with the third component @xmath162 of the flux .",
    "the factor of @xmath163 is responsible for the fact that the action of the @xmath3-invariant operator @xmath164 produces the @xmath2 quadratic casimir when it acts on the holonomies @xmath157 .",
    "of course , one could think of writing the action of the length operator on the @xmath0 holonomies @xmath7 in the basis @xmath165 instead of @xmath66 , but then the spectrum would come with an incorrect minus sign .",
    "3 .   even if the spectrum ( [ lengthspectrum ] ) is continuous when using the connection @xmath74 instead of @xmath5 , there exists a length gap between `` no length '' and the first non - trivial possible length .",
    "another regularization , discussed in @xcite , would give @xmath21 instead of @xmath166 for the action of the length operator on holonomies colored with a representation @xmath21 , and no length gap would exist in this case .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a discussion of this ambiguity .",
    "the area operator in three dimensions is the analogue of the volume operator in four dimensions , and it acts on the vertices of the spin networks . for obvious reasons , we will be interested only in its action on three - valent vertices . denoting by @xmath167 , @xmath168 and",
    "@xmath169 the three links meeting at the vertex @xmath89 , we will use the notation @xmath170 for the area operator at @xmath89 .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the following expression for the regularized area operator acting on the three - valent vertex @xmath89 @xcite : ( _",
    "1,_2,_3)^2=16_i < j(x_^*_i^2x_^*_j^2-(x_^*_ix_^*_j)^2 ) , where @xmath171 label the edges meeting at the vertex .",
    "one can then show that the action of the area operator is diagonal , with eigenvalues given by ( _ 1,_2,_3)^2=16_(i , j)(_i^2_j^2-(_i_j)^2 ) , where the sum contains only the three terms @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",

    "finally , @xmath177 denotes the eigenvalue of the length operator @xmath178 ( [ length operator ] ) . using the gauss law at the vertex @xmath89 to write @xmath179",

    "is therefore immediate .",

    "contrary to the @xmath0 kinematical case where the triangular inequalities are automatically satisfied due to the standard properties of tensor products between unitary irreducible representations , here this condition has to be imposed by hand because the representations are in the continuous series of @xmath16 .",
    "to finish , let us study more precisely the case in which @xmath35 is a torus .",
    "the torus can be represented by the flower graph with two petals as shown in figure [ torus ] .     and two loops , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , corresponding to the non - contractible cycles of the torus .",
    "a spin network state associated to the flower graph is an assignment of unitary irreducible representations of the suitable lie algebra to the two loops and to the vertex .",
    "the vertex being four - valent , it can be decomposed into two three - valent vertices , with the spin previously attached to @xmath89 now coloring the link @xmath169 .",
    "as shown on the right , this graph with three links can be seen as dual to the rectangle with identified opposite edges that defines the torus .",
    "this rectangle can be triangulated into two triangles sharing the side of length @xmath181 and dual to the vertices @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "the spins @xmath184 and @xmath185 coloring the loops @xmath167 and @xmath168 represent the edge lengths of the rectangle . ]    in this case , one can construct the kinematical spin network states of the @xmath0 theory based on the three - dimensional ashtekar - barbero connection @xmath38 .",
    "these states , denoted by @xmath186 , are totally characterized by the three spin labels @xmath187 coloring the two loops @xmath167 and @xmath168 ( for the first two labels ) and the vertex @xmath89 .",
    "note that the choice of a `` shape '' for the intertwiner is not important ( i.e. the choice of a triangulation for the rectangle in figure [ torus ] is arbitrary ) .",
    "our choice , which is depicted in figure [ torus ] , corresponds to a triangulation of the parallelogram into two triangles .",
    "since the graph is minimal , the kinematical scalar product is given by _",
    "( j_1,j_2,j_3),_(j_1,j_2,j_3)=_i=1 ^ 3_j_i , j_i , where @xmath188 denotes the kronecker delta .",
    "the length and area operators of the @xmath0 kinematical theory are unitary with respect to this scalar product since their action is diagonal with positive eigenvalues .",
    "furthermore , the geometric interpretation of the spin labels is immediate : they are associated with the length of the three edge of the ( similar ) triangles that discretize the parallelogram whose opposite sides are identified to construct the torus .    now , the construction of the physical states would a priori require to solve the ashtekar - barbero hamiltonian constraint ( [ f=0 in time gauge ] ) .",
    "just like in four - dimensional loop quantum gravity , it is not known wether or not at the physical level the @xmath1 dependency will disappear and the nature of the geometric operators change . however , in the present three - dimensional model , the route to constructing the physical states is known .",
    "one can go back to the complex connection ( [ decomposition of a ] ) , impose the simplicity constraint that turns it into an @xmath2 connection , and then the hamiltonian constraint becomes simply the flatness constraint of @xmath16 bf theory . in this case , the scalar product between physical states is given by _",
    "( s_1,s_2,s_3),_(s_1,s_2,s_3)=_i=1 ^ 3(s_i - s_i ) , where @xmath189 is the dirac delta distribution , and any other quantization scheme ( like the @xmath0 formulation in the time gauge ) should lead to the same result in order for it to be anomaly - free .",
    "in this short paper , we have studied the loop quantization of three - dimensional gravity based on two different classical formulations of the hamiltonian theory . using the results of @xcite",
    ", we have first written the canonical theory in terms of @xmath0 ashtekar - barbero variables with a real barbero - immirzi parameter .",
    "then , we have argued that there is a simpler hamiltonian formulation ( in terms of a flatness constraint ) , in which the connection becomes complex and has to be supplemented by appropriate reality conditions .",
    "when these are implemented classically in the form of a linear simplicity constraint , one recovers an @xmath2 connection which does still depend on real values of the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath1 .",
    "however , as we have shown , this connection leads to a quantum theory with @xmath1-independent and continuous spectra for the geometric operators .",
    "it is important to stress out that what we did was not to compare the new @xmath0 ashtekar - barbero formulation of three - dimensional gravity with usual first order lorentzian gravity ( i.e. @xmath16 bf theory ) . instead ,",
    "starting from the @xmath0 theory , we have naturally ended up with a new choice of connection that enables to work out the hamiltonian constraint ( just like the choice @xmath190 in four dimensions ) , with the additional requirement that this connection should satisfy a reality condition similar to the spin foam linear simplicity constraint .",
    "which lessons can be learned for four - dimensional loop quantum gravity ?",
    "the present model shows that already at the kinematical level one can have two very different quantum theories depending on the choice of connection .",
    "the same observation seems to be true in four dimensions , although it has never been made rigorous because of the absence of a kinematical arena for the self - dual connection of ashtekar or the non - commutative shifted connection of alexandrov .",
    "moreover , it is clear in this three - dimensional model that physical states are @xmath16 spin networks , therefore raising the question of wether the implementation of the ashtekar - barbero hamiltonian constraint ( [ f=0 in time gauge ] ) will also lead to these physical states , and to the disappearance of the barbero - immirzi parameter .",
    "even if we have not addressed this question here , our model could be taken as a starting point to investigate this direction .",
    "to summarize , if one tries to support the point of view that @xmath1 should not play a role at the physical level , there are essentially three possible scenarios .    1 .",
    "the first one is a quantum theory based on the @xmath0 kinematics , and in which the barbero - immirzi parameter disappears in the quantum theory at the level of physical states ( with possibly the spectra becoming continuous ) . from what is known today about the quantum scalar constraint",
    ", this does not seem to be the case .",
    "moreover , the eprl and fk@xmath191 spin foam models are designed in such a way that @xmath1 plays a central role in the definition of the dynamics of the theory .",
    "2 .   another possibility would be to go back to the self - dual connection already at the classical level , and to find a way of dealing with the reality conditions .",
    "this is what has been done in the three - dimensional model of @xcite and in the present paper . as we have seen ,",
    "the reason for which this is possible in three - dimensions is that there is a natural notion of reality for the complex connection , which corresponds to considering its non - compact subgroup @xmath16 by means of the linear simplicity constraint .",
    "then , the non - compactness can be handled due to the topological nature of the theory , and the resulting possibility of working on a fixed minimal graph .",
    "3 .   it seems to us that the most promising direction would be to consider @xmath1 as a regulator needed in order to deal with the non - compactness of the gauge group .",
    "because the four - dimensional theory has local degrees of freedom , this non - compactness can not be handled like in the three - dimensional case by fixing a minimal graph .",
    "the introduction of the barbero - immirzi parameter could therefore be seen as a generalized wick rotation , which has to be unfolded at the end of the day in order to obtain physical results .",
    "this procedure of going through a compact gauge group in order to define the theory , and then using tools of analytic continuation to return to the non - compact case , was put forward in the computation of black hole entropy in four @xcite and three dimensions @xcite ( although in this last reference the regulator is the chern - simons level rather than the barbero - immirzi parameter ) .",
    "if this last interpretation of the barbero - immirzi parameter turns out to be the correct one , then one should reconsider the results derived from the kinematical structure of the @xmath0 theory , since these rely heavily on the compactness of the gauge group and the value @xmath17 .",
    "the key open question is in fact that of knowing at which step to perform the analytic continuation back to the self - dual value @xmath78 , if this can be given any well - defined meaning in the ( canonical or covariant ) full theory at all .",
