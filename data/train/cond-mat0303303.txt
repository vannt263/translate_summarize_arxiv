    "these include the five - vertex model @xcite , the f model @xcite , the kdp model @xcite , the general six - vertex model @xcite , the free - fermion model solved by fan and wu @xcite , and the symmetric 8-vertex model solved by baxter @xcite .",
    "all these previously considered models are described by line graphs drawn on a simple - quartic lattice where the number of lines incident at each vertex is even , and therefore can be regarded as the  even \" vertex models .    in this paper",

    "there are again eight possible ways of drawing lines at a vertex , and this leads to the _",
    "odd 8-vertex model_. besides being a challenging mathematical problem by itself , as we shall see the odd 8-vertex model includes some well - known unsolved lattice - statistical problems .",
    "it also finds applications in enumerating dimer configurations @xcite .",

    "the partition function ( [ part ] ) possesses obvious symmetries .",
    "an edge can either have a line is or be vacant . by reversing the line - vacancy role",
    "one obtains the symmetry",

    "the solution of ( [ part ] ) in this case is well - known @xcite .",
    "our approach to the odd 8-vertex model is to explore its equivalence with a staggered 8-vertex model .",
    "we first recall the definition of a staggered 8-vertex model @xcite .",
    "a staggered 8-vertex model is an ( even ) 8-vertex model with sublattice - dependent vertex weights .",

    "it is convenient to abbreviate the partition function by writing z_stag ( _ 1,_2,,_8 ; _1,_2,,_8 ) z_stag(12345678 ; 12345678 ) .",
    "[ 16part ]    when @xmath13 for all @xmath1 , the staggered 8-vertex model reduces to the usual 8-vertex model with uniform weights , which remains unsolved for general @xmath12 .",

    "the consideration of the sublattice symmetry implies that we have z_stag ( 12345678 ; 12345678 ) = z_stag ( 12345678 ; 12345678 ) . [ sub1 ]",
    "returning to the odd 8-vertex model we have the following result :    _ theorem : the odd 8-vertex model ( [ part ] ) is equivalent to a staggered 8-vertex model ( [ 16part ] ) with the equivalence z_128 & = & z_stag(u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4,u_5 , u_6,u_7,u_8 ;  u_3 , u_4 , u_1,u_2,u_8,u_7,u_6,u_5 ) + & = & z_stag(u_5,u_6,u_8,u_7,u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4 ;   u_7,u_8,u_6,u_5,u_4,u_3,u_1,u_2 ) , or , in abbreviations , _",

    "because of the particular choice of @xmath18 , however , the vertex weights are sublattice - dependent and we have a _ staggered _ 8-vertex model .    for sites on sublattice @xmath15 , the conversion maps a vertex type @xmath19 in fig . 1 into a type @xmath19 in fig .",
