    "at @xmath24 colliders copious photons are emitted from the beam electrons or positrons , where most of the photons carry only a small four - momentum squared @xmath25 , and can be considered to be quasi - real ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "these quasi - real photons can interact with each other and produce hadrons in the final state . before tristan experiments",
    ", hadron production in quasi - real photon - photon ( @xmath7 ) collisions had generally been thought to be mainly caused by soft processes , and that perturbative - qcd can not be applied .",
    "this situations drastically changed when the production of high - transverse - energy ( @xmath3 ) jets was observed in @xmath7 interactions at tristan@xcite and lep@xcite @xmath24 colliders .",
    "high-@xmath3 jet production in @xmath7 collisions is an interesting field to study the photon structure and to test perturbative qcd predictions .",
    "since the photon can fluctuate into hadronic components before interactions , three classes of hard qcd processes are expected to contribute to jet production at the leading order ( lo)@xcite : either as a direct process where two photons directly interact ( fig.[fig : fig1]a ) , one - resolved process where a bare photon interacts with a parton ( quark or gluon ) of the other photon ( fig.[fig : fig1]b ) , or a two - resolved process where partons of both photons interact ( fig.[fig : fig1]c ) .",
    "the jet cross sections as a function of @xmath3 were measured up to 8 gev by topaz@xcite and amy@xcite , and were compared with the next - leading - order qcd calculations in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently , the jet cross sections were measured up to 17 gev at lep2 by opal@xcite .",
    "the existence of the remnant - jet , i.e. accompanied hadronic activities in the low - angle region , is a direct signature of the resolved processes .",
    "this signature has been observed in topaz@xcite and opal@xcite experiments .",
    "it has been reported that the charm - quark production in @xmath7 collisions requires the resolved - photon processes@xcite .",
    "the necessity of gluon contents in the photon is emphasized in ref.@xcite . in photon - hadron interactions ,",
    "similar qcd predictions have already been confirmed at the hera @xmath27 collider@xcite .",
    "in addition to production rates of jets , the internal structure of jets , i.e. jet shape or jet profile , is expected to provide additional information about the qcd dynamics @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the shape might depend on the type of primary parton ; quark or gluon .",
    "however , it also depends on the kinematical variables , such as the transverse energy and rapidity of the jets , as well as the jet algorithm . theoretically , the jet shape is related to the ratio of the higher - order cross sections divided by the leading - order cross sections@xcite .",
    "therefore , the next - leading - order ( nlo ) calculation of the jet rates provides leading - order predictions on the jet shape@xcite .",
    "although nlo predictions on the jet shape in hadron ( or photon ) interactions are not yet available , it is suggested in ref.@xcite that the jets in hadron - hadron , photon - hadron and photon - photon collisions at different c.m .",
    "energies @xmath28 should have the same shape for an equal value of the scaled variable @xmath29 at the fixed value of the jet pseudorapidity(@xmath30 ) .",
    "dependence in the jet shape is mainly caused by the dependence in the hard sub - process cross sections .",
    "however , the sub - process cross sections depend only on dimensionless variables , @xmath4 , @xmath31 and the momentum fraction @xmath32 of the incoming partons and other dimensional factors cancel in the ratio .",
    "since @xmath32 have been integrated over in the observable , the jet shape depends only on @xmath4 for fixed @xmath30 . in the experiments ,",
    "the jet shape in the central region ( @xmath33 ) has been mainly measured so far . ] a small deviation from the scaling behavior is expected only through the @xmath3 dependence in the strong - coupling constant @xmath34 .    in this paper",
    ", we study the @xmath3 dependence of the jet shape produced both in @xmath7 collisions and in @xmath24 annihilation process at the hadron level .",
    "the cone jet finding algorithm is applied for both reactions .    in the jet cone algorithm , so far , two kinds of jet shape variables , i.e. the jet profile function@xcite and the jet width , have been used in experiments .",
    "the jet profile function is given by the fraction of the jet energy within an inner cone of a certain size .",
    "this has been used in @xmath35 collisions at tevatron@xcite , @xmath10 collisions by the zeus collaboration at hera@xcite and @xmath7@xcite and @xmath24@xcite collisions by the opal collaboration at lep . on the other hand ,",
    "the jet width was used for the first time in studies of @xmath10 collisions by the h1 collaboration at hera@xcite .",
    "they applied the same method to the @xmath36 data in ua1 and observed a scaling behavior of the jet width for the jets in @xmath10 and @xmath37 collisions@xcite .",
    "we here extend the h1-method for the jets produced in @xmath7 collisions and @xmath24 annihilations .",
    "we measured the jet width as a function of @xmath3 for both inclusive - jet and dijet samples .",
    "the width was measured up to @xmath38 gev for @xmath7 collisions , which corresponds to 0.3 in @xmath39 .",
    "the region of @xmath40 could be measured by using @xmath0 annihilation events .",
    "the jet width for direct and resolved samples in @xmath7 collisions was also studied separately by reconstructing the momentum - fraction of the parton inside the photon for dijet events .",
    "the data used in this analysis were taken with the topaz detector at the tristan @xmath1 collider ( kek ) at an average center - of - mass energy of 58.0 gev .",
    "all data taken for the period from 1990 to 1995 were used in this analysis , which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 287.8 pb@xmath41 .",
    "a detailed description of the topaz detector can be found elsewhere @xcite-@xcite . in this analysis ,",
    "both charged tracks and the neutral clusters were used for event selection and jet reconstruction .",
    "charged tracks were measured in a 1.0 tesla magnetic field with the time - projection - chamber ( tpc ) in the angular region of @xmath42 0.85 , where @xmath43 is the polar angle of a particle with respect to the beam axis .",
    "tpc provided a momentum resolution of @xmath44(% ) , where @xmath45 ( in gev ) is the transverse momentum to the beam axis .",
    "electromagnetic showers were detected with three kinds of calorimeters : a barrel lead - glass calorimeter ( bcl ) , an end - cap pb - proportional - wire - counter - sandwich calorimeter ( ecl ) and a forward bismuth - germanate - crystal calorimeter ( fcl ) .",
    "each detector covered polar angular ranges of @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "since fcl is located very close to the beam pipe , the calorimeter is protected from beam - induced backgrounds by an extensive shielding system @xcite .    in @xmath9 collisions ,",
    "the detection efficiencies are sensitive to the trigger condition of charged tracks because of their low momentum and low multiplicity of tracks@xcite . through the experiments ,",
    "the conditions of the charged track - trigger were changed according to the beam conditions .",
    "there must be at least two tracks with @xmath50 0.3 gev @xmath51 0.7 gev ; also the minimum opening angle of the two highest @xmath52 tracks is 45@xmath53 @xmath51 70@xmath53 .",
    "the change in the trigger conditions was taken into account in the topaz simulation program .",
    "the effects on the jet width studied in this analysis were found to be negligible ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the hadronic events produced in @xmath7 collisions are selected in the following criteria :    the number of charged tracks with @xmath55 gev and the polar angle @xmath56 should be at least 4 ;    the position of the event vertex should be within 3.0 cm in the r@xmath57-plane and within @xmath58 3.0 cm along the beam line from the interaction point ;    the visible energy ( @xmath59 ) of the event should satisfy @xmath60 gev , where both the charged tracks in tpc and the neutral clusters in bcl and ecl are used in the calculation of @xmath59 ;    the mass of the system of the observed hadrons ( @xmath61 ) should be @xmath62 gev , where the tracks in tpc and the clusters in bcl and ecl are used ; and    the energy of the most energetic cluster in bcl , ecl , or fcl should be less than 0.25 @xmath63 .",
    "these selection criteria leave 286k multihadron events .",
    "the criterion 5 ensures the anti - tag condition , which limits the scattering angle of the beam electrons to be less than @xmath64 . with this anti - tag requirement",
    ", the virtuality ( @xmath65 ) of the photons ranges from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath68 is @xmath69 gev@xmath70 .    for the hadronic events in @xmath24 annihilation process ,",
    "the standard cuts which have been used in the topaz collaboration were applied to 278.0 pb@xmath41 of data .",
    "the criteria used in the selection are described in ref.@xcite .",
    "a total of 29k @xmath24 annihilation events were selected . in order to identify jets in the hadronic events",
    "both in @xmath7 collisions and @xmath24 annihilation process , we used the conventional jet cone algorithm@xcite , where a jet is defined as a large amount of transverse energy ( or momentum ) concentrated in a cone of radius @xmath71 in the @xmath31(pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle @xmath43 as @xmath72 - ln tan(@xmath43/2 ) .",

    "a particle @xmath73 is included in a jet if it lies within the cone @xmath74 in the cone algorithm , the transverse energy of the jet ( @xmath75 ) is calculated as a scalar sum of the particle transverse energy ( @xmath76 ) in a cone , @xmath77 and the jet direction(@xmath30 and @xmath78 ) is defined by the following weighted averages : @xmath79 the jet direction is determined by iteration .",
    "the iteration is stopped when particles contained in the cone are not changed in the next iteration .",
    "when two or more jets overlap each other , particles in the overlapped region were assigned to the highest @xmath3 jet in this analysis . in jet reconstruction ,",
    "all charged particles with a transverse momentum greater than 0.10 gev and neutral particles with an energy greater than 0.3 gev were used . in this analysis ,",
    "the size of the cone radius(@xmath71 ) was fixed at @xmath80 .",
    "the detector effects on the jet @xmath3 and jet directions @xmath81 were checked by using monte - carlo samples generated by the pythia program ( version : 5.720)@xcite .",
    "the results show that the jet directions@xmath81 have good correlations between the generated and observed quantities .",
    "the resolutions are @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath30 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "however , @xmath3 in the observed level is systematically lower than the generated ( hadron level ) one by about @xmath84 .",
    "this effect has been corrected in the data . after correcting @xmath3 , 39,829 inclusive - jets in @xmath7 collisions",
    "are selected with the conditions of @xmath85 2.0 gev and @xmath86 0.7 .",
    "dijet events are selected by taking an event with two or more jets with fulfilling that the highest @xmath75 be greater than 3.0 gev and the second highest @xmath75 be greater than 2.0 gev@xcite .",
    "the pseudorapidity of both jets is required to be within @xmath86 0.7 . with this condition ,",
    "3,582 dijet events are selected .",
    "the beam - gas background remaining in the inclusive - jet and dijet samples was estimated to be 11.2% and 0.70% , respectively , from the number of events in the side - band of the event - vertex distribution along the beam - axis .",
    "the physical background mainly comes from @xmath24 annihilation events : @xmath87 .",
    "the contribution of this background has been estimated from the koralz@xcite and pythia programs to be 9.54% and 18.4% for inclusive - jet and dijet samples , respectively .",
    "the other physical backgrounds ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) were found to be 0.19% ( 0.61% ) , 1.21% ( 2.48% ) and 0.28% ( 0.86% ) for the inclusive - jet ( dijet ) samples .",
    "hereafter , these backgrounds are subtracted from data on a bin - by - bin basis .",
    "we first demonstrate how the direct and resolved contributions can be separated in the dijet sample in @xmath7 collisions .",
    "this separation is a useful tool to study the jet width from direct and resolved processes independently .",
    "other detailed studies of the hadronic final state in this dijet sample are given in ref.@xcite .    in the leading - order qcd ,",
    "two hard partons are produced in @xmath9 collisions . in the one- or two - resolved processes ,",
    "two high-@xmath3 jets are expected to be accompanied by one or two remnant jets in the near beam - direction@xcite .",
    "a pair of variables , @xmath91 and @xmath92 can then be defined which specify the fraction of the photon momentum carried by the parton inside the photon in hard interactions .",
    "one can calculate @xmath93 from the observables with a good approximation @xcite : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the momentum component along the @xmath96-axis of the detector and @xmath97 is the energy of each particle or jet .",
    "the numerator of eq.([eq : x ] ) is the sum for particles within the jet cone , while the denominator is the sum for all particles in a dijet event . since the direction of the electron beam",
    "is taken to be the positive direction of the @xmath96-axis in the topaz convention , @xmath98(@xmath99 ) corresponds to the parton - momentum fraction of the photon radiated from electron ( positron ) beam .",
    "we introduce a variable , @xmath100 , which is defined as the smaller value of @xmath101 and @xmath102 .    in fig.[fig :",
    "x ] , the distribution of @xmath100 is compared with the monte - carlo predictions of the pythia ( 5.720 ) program , where no correction for the selection cut and the detector effects has been applied , but the background has been subtracted .",
    "the contribution from the direct and resolved processes , predicted by pythia , are also shown separately .",
    "the predictions of pythia are normalized to the luminosity of data by taking into account the predicted cross sections .",
    "the clear peak seen in the vicinity of @xmath103 1 can be well - explained from the direct component . in the low-@xmath104 region ( @xmath105 0.8 ) , where the contribution from the resolved processes dominates , it is found that the overall shape as well as its magnitude are well explained by pythia with the grv - lo photon structure function@xcite , though for the region around 0.2 @xmath106 0.6 the prediction is about 20% higher than the data .",
    "( the comparison with other cases are given in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in an analysis of the jet width , the direct and resolved samples are separated at @xmath100 = 0.85 . in the monte - carlo simulation of pythia , about 67% of the events from the direct process are contained in the @xmath107 0.85 region , while about 90% of the events from the resolved process are contained in the @xmath108 0.85 region .",
    "the transverse energy flow versus the azimuthal angle around the jet direction is shown in fig.[fig : dedphi]a for inclusive - jets with @xmath109 and @xmath110 in @xmath7 collisions . in a plot",
    "the pseudo - rapidity of each particle is limited to within 1.0 unit in order to avoid any effect from the remnant - jets .",
    "fig.[fig : dedphi]b shows the same transverse energy flow for @xmath24 annihilation events with the same jet cone algorithm .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is required to be greater than 15 gev .",
    "although both energy flows in @xmath7 and @xmath24 collisions show a similar jet profile , the width is very different .    in order to make the discussion more quantitative ,",
    "we define the jet width as the full width at the half maximum of the distribution of the transverse energy flow ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "this jet width is determined by fitting the energy flow with the following formula : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the azimuthal angle difference between the jet direction and each particle .",
    "parameter @xmath114 describes the amplitude of the energy flow at @xmath115 , and @xmath116 reflects the constant pedestal energy below the peak .",
    "the jet width ( @xmath117 ) can be obtained from the parameter @xmath118 as @xmath119 this is the same formula as that used in the h1 experiment for the analysis of the jet width in @xmath10 reactions @xcite .",
    "the fit is carried out only in the peak region , @xmath120 .",
    "since the jet width can be measured by using only a fiducial volume of the detector , it is expected that the distortion caused by the detector is small , but not negligible .",
    "a finite detection efficiency of the charged and neutral particles as well as their finite resolutions might distort the original jet width .",
    "we correct these detector effects by monte - carlo simulations .",

    "the first errors are statistical and the second ones are systematics .",
    "the systematic errors on the width are estimated by changing the size of the @xmath113 bin by factors from 1/5 to 5 to the nominal bin - size shown in fig.[fig : dedphi ] .",
    "the systematics caused by these binning effects are estimated to be less than 3% .",
    "the systematics estimated from the difference of the correction factors in pythia and phojet programs are about @xmath582% . in the fit , a pedestal energy below the peak is assumed to be constant in eq.([eq : fit ] ) .",
