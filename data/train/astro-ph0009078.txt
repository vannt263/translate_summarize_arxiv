    "ngc  1068 is a nearby heavily obscured seyfert  2 galaxy with a bright active galactic nucleus ( agn ) which has been studied in nearly every available wavelength band and at many spatial resolutions .",
    "its classification as a seyfert  2 nucleus rests on the basis of narrow emission lines .",
    "antonucci & miller ( 1985 ) have , however , discovered broad , polarized emission lines indicative of a broad line region , which suggests the presence of a seyfert  1 nucleus hidden by a thick circumnuclear torus or a heavily warped disk , a possibility we shall henceforth include in the word `` torus '' .",
    "barthel ( 1989 ) suggested that ngc  1068 might be a prototype for many classes of agns .",
    "thus ngc  1068 has provided the framework for a unification scheme based on a dense disk of molecular gas and dust surrounding a broad line region and seyfert  1 nucleus ; see e.g. , krolik ( 1999 ) and references therein . in this model ,",
    "seyfert  1 and 2 galaxies are substantially similar objects viewed at different orientations .",
    "an alternative to the torus geometry that has been suggested by cameron et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , is that the molecular material in the nuclear vicinity is distributed in such a way that the bulk of the gas and dust lies @xmath1100  pc or so from the nucleus .",
    "we take the distance to ngc  1068 as 14.4  mpc ( tully 1988 ) so that 1@xmath0 = 72  pc ; we assume h@xmath4 to be 75  km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 throughout this paper .",
    "since antonucci & miller ( 1985 ) suggested that ngc  1068 contains an obscuring torus , there have been numerous theoretical studies of thick tori in agns .",
    "three that have focused on ngc  1068 , mainly constrained by the energetics , are efstathiou , hugh & young ( 1995 ) , pier & krolik ( 1993 ) and granato , danese , & franceschini ( 1997 ) ; these give numerous references to other theoretical models and issues .",
    "recently , observations of the nucleus of ngc  1068 at a range of wavelengths with high spatial resolution have been published .",
    "differences exist between different images , but most find strong nuclear emission in a roughly north - south direction ; the putative torus is presumed to lie in roughly an east - west plane",

    "subsequent radio measurements by planesas , scoville & myers ( 1991 ) and papadopoulos , seaquist & scoville ( 1997 ) further delineated the properties of the molecular cloud .",
    "finally , laurent et al .  ( 2000 ) obtained cvf spectra between 5 and 16  @xmath2 m which allowed them to clearly separate the mid - infrared emission from the nucleus and from the outer ring .",

    "( 1998 ) who made diffraction limited observations ( fwhm @xmath10.5@xmath0 ) with the hale 200-inch telescope at 8.8 , 10.3 and 12.5  @xmath2 m ; see bock et al .   for references to previous mid - infrared work .",

    "the present observations were limited to the inner 4@xmath0 of the galaxy and pertain to this extreme nuclear region only .",
    "observations of ngc  1068 were conducted from the keck  2 10-meter telescope on the nights of 1  october and 3  october  1998 with the mid - infrared camera mirlin ( ressler et al .",
    "mirlin is based on the hf-16 128  @xmath10  128 si : as bib focal plane array with a plate scale at the keck telescope of 0.138@xmath0  pixel@xmath5 , resulting in nyquist - sampling of the diffraction - limited airy function for @xmath1812  @xmath2 m . in order to characterize and monitor the point spread function and to obtain photometric calibration , observations of ngc  1068 were interleaved with those of a bright infrared stellar source , either bs = hr  0911 ( @xmath19  cetus ) or bs = hr  1457 ( @xmath19  taurus ) .",
    "the sequence of observations shown in table  1 was chosen so that the infrared standards were observed at a similar elevation angle as ngc  1068 .",
    "the targets were observed in four mid - infrared spectral bands , centered on 7.91  @xmath2 m ( @xmath20=0.76  @xmath2 m ) , 10.27  @xmath2 m ( @xmath20=1.01  @xmath2 m ) , 12.49  @xmath2 m ( @xmath20=1.16  @xmath2 m ) , and 24.48  @xmath2 m ( @xmath20=0.76  @xmath2 m ) .    in order to accurately subtract thermal emission from the atmosphere and telescope , each target was observed with a standard `` chop and nod '' strategy .",
    "a chopped image was created by coadding exposures in the on and off beam of the chopping secondary mirror .",
    "the telescope was then nodded to remove any offset induced by the chopper , and the observation repeated to create the  chop - nodded \" image .",
    "typical integration times were 80 to 100  ms in each beam of the chopper , with a total of 4 - 5  s of integration on the sky spent on each of the four images .",
    "table  1 is a log of the observations .",
    "each observation listed in table  1 consisted of a sequence of at least three chop - nodded images at each wavelength , dithered by @xmath1  0.7@xmath0 between images in order to sample different pixels on the array .",
    "the telescope was guided during the observations on nearby stars using an automated optical guider , always selecting the guide star so as to avoid diffraction spikes from the target .",
    "the chop and nod amplitudes were each 5@xmath0 so as to keep the image of the target on the focal plane array for maximum observing efficiency . to avoid any smearing of the images during the exposures , the settling time during each chopper cycle was 15  ms and the settling time between nod positions was 15  s. in order to confirm the psf was not elongated due to chopping or nodding , the chopping was north - south and nodding east - west on 1  october  1998 and the chopping was east - west and nodding north - south on 3  october  1998 .",
    "the raw data of ngc  1068 and the psf calibration stars were combined by dividing each exposure by a flat field frame and interpolating over bad pixels from a bad pixel mask .",
    "the four sub - images in each chopped - nodded frame were combined , spatially filtered to reduce noise at high spatial frequencies , and rotated to a reference angle .",
    "these dithered sub - images were then coadded to produce a single image for each image number in table  1 .",
    "because the telescope operates on an altazimuth mount , the characteristic diffraction spikes induced by the segmented primary and secondary spiders appear to rotate in equatorial coordinates during the night . in the mid infrared ,",
    "the relative intensity of the diffraction spikes is small , roughly 1% of the peak intensity of the psf . in the case of ngc  1068",
    ", each image was rotated to equatorial north . for the psf images , each raw image was either rotated to equatorial north , for purposes of creating the deconvolved images of ngc  1068 , or , for purposes of creating the deconvolved images of the psf , rotated to a common elevation angle thus keeping the orientation of the diffraction spikes fixed .",
    "the images were rebinned to a finer pixel scale ( 0.034@xmath0  pixel@xmath5 ) and deconvolved using a richardson - lucy maximum likelihood solution subject to a positivity constraint as developed by richardson  ( 1972 ) and lucy  ( 1974 ) .",
    "the deconvolved images of ngc  1068 and the psf are shown in figure  1 .",
    "as the deconvolved image depends critically on the stability of the psf image , the matching of the psf calibrator in elevation angle and the interleaved observations of ngc  1068 and the psf should give optimal results .    to estimate the stability of the psf image , one image was formed from the normalized sum of the first , third and fifth images of the psf from table  1 and a second image was formed from the normalized sum of the second and fourth images from table  1 .",
    "this linear combination of psf images results in a small effective difference in elevation angle between the two combined images .",
    "the deconvolution of the first of these combined psf images by the second results in the compact images of the psf shown in the third column of figure  1 ( fwhm @xmath10.1@xmath0 ) .",
    "the combined image of hr  0911 obtained on 3 october was also deconvolved by the combined image of hr  0911 obtained on 1 october , with an excellent result and negligible residual features . a more detailed discussion of various tests made to verify the deconvolution procedure is given in the appendix .",
    "mirlin only provides sub - critical spatial sampling of the psf for wavelengths @xmath21 12  @xmath2 m .",
    "because the image deconvolution requires critically sampled images , all of the unprocessed images taken at 7.9 and 10.3  @xmath2 m were first smoothed by convolving them with a 2-d gaussian function of fwhm 0.2@xmath0 before proceeding with the data reduction",
    ". this smoothing has the effect of degrading the intrinsic spatial resolution at 7.9 and 10.3  @xmath2 m to the intrinsic spatial resolution at 12.5  @xmath2 m .",
    "photometric measurements were made of the raw images before any deconvolution algorithms were applied .",
    "photometry was based on the measurements of hr  1457 and hr  0911 whose magnitudes were determined by a combination of an inter - comparison of several measurements taken on several nights , by an extrapolation based on their effective temperature and by a consistency with the iras 12 and 25 @xmath2 m measurements .",
    "the magnitudes adopted at wavelengths 7.9 , 10.3 , 12.5 and 24.5  @xmath2 m are -2.99 , -3.04 , -3.07 and -3.03  mag for hr  1457 and -1.86 , -1.89 , -1.92 and -1.96  mag for hr  0911 .",
    "the `` sky '' was taken as an annulus 4.6 to 6.0@xmath0 in diameter .",

    "@xmath2 m the fwhm was @xmath10.4@xmath0 due primarily to the smoothing described in section  3.2 .",
    "the ratio of the peak flux density per pixel to the noise level in the raw images varies from @xmath1300 in the 24.5  @xmath2 m image to @xmath221,000 in the other three images .",
    "the four images were deconvolved as described above and the four deconvolved images of ngc  1068 and of the psfs , derived as described above , are given in figure  1 .",
    "the fwhm of the deconvolved psf in the 12.5  @xmath2 m image is 0.05@xmath0 ; that at 7.9 , 10.3 and 24.5  @xmath2 m is 0.07 , 0.10 and 0.12@xmath0 .",
    "the maximum contour shown is of pixels with a flux density surface brightness of 0.9@xmath10[maximum flux density surface brightness per pixel ] .",
    "the minimum contour shown is down by a factor of 140 from the peak surface brightness in the 7.9 , 10.3 , and 12.5  @xmath2 m images , and by a factor of 70 in the 24.5  @xmath2 m image .",
    "the uncertainties increase towards the center , to roughly 5% of the peak surface brightness at the peak in the case of the 12.5  @xmath2 m image .",
    "based on the reproducibility of the deconvolved images described in the appendices , the confidence in the reproducibility in the 12.5  @xmath2 m image extends to the minimum contour shown and is somewhat less at the other wavelengths . in the 7.9  @xmath2 m image",
    "the feature to the southwest is possibly spurious , as it does not reproduce in the first and second deconvolved images ( see figure  8) .",
    "a full accounting of the sources of uncertainty is given in the appendices .",
    "figure  8 demonstrates the reproducibility of the deconvolved images from independent data sets .    as seen in table  1 , the image taken at 12.5  @xmath2 m had the largest number of multiple redundant observations .",
    "it has the highest angular resolution and highest signal to noise ratio , i.e. , dynamic range , of the four images obtained . for these reasons",
    "we have chosen to duplicate the deconvolved 12.5  @xmath2 m image in figure  1b .",
    "we want to emphasize , however , that all four images , in particular that at 24.5  @xmath2 m , show qualitatively the same features .",
    "each of the images is dominated by a central peak which contains @xmath1  one third to one - half of the flux in a 4@xmath0 diameter beam depending on the limits ascribed to the peak , which are ambiguous .",
    "the fwhm of the peak at 12.5  @xmath2 m is 0.26@xmath0 ; the widths at the other wavelengths are comparable .",
    "the peak contains extended emission , and , as shown below , is significantly more extended than can be accounted for by a point - like source .",
    "the emission above @xmath110% of the peak surface brightness is generally extended in a well resolved north - south line ( position angle measured east from north @xmath110@xmath3 ) about 1@xmath0 ( 70  pc ) in length .",
    "both the central peak and this extended emission are compact in the east - west direction . with the present deconvolution , they are formally slightly larger than the psfs in the east - west direction ; the measurements imply an intrinsic width of the peak at different wavelengths between @xmath10.05@xmath0 and @xmath10.1@xmath0 .",
    "this is sufficiently small that we do not claim that we have resolved the peak in the east - west direction . at the different wavelengths , the peak blends smoothly into the clearly extended emission in the north - south direction .",
    "based on a comparison of the raw images and re - convolved images , we estimate that for distances @xmath230.5@xmath0 from the peak , the average uncertainty per pixel in the deconvolved images ranges from @xmath14% of the peak value per pixel at 24.5  @xmath2 m to @xmath11% in the other three images",
    ". the uncertainties generally increase towards the peak ; see the appendix for details .",
    "the fainter extended emission follows a similar pattern in the four wavelengths bands .",
    "the northern extension appears to first bend slightly west , @xmath10.35@xmath0 north of the infrared peak , and then , @xmath10.5@xmath0 north of the infrared peak , becomes more extended and bends east by @xmath160@xmath3 .",
    "the southern emission , which is less extended than the northern emission , also becomes more diffuse south of the largest infrared peak .",
    "a faint source appears @xmath10.75@xmath0 to the northeast of the main infrared peak .",

    "the uncertainties listed include both statistical and estimated calibration uncertainties .",
    "the flux densities reported here are similar to those reported in the literature . in view of the well established dependence on beam size plus the known near - infrared variability in the luminosity of the nucleus of ngc  1068 , which is as large as a factor of two in two decades at 3  @xmath2 m ( see , e.g.",

    "the latter has been determined from the published literature and reflects large beam measurements such as the iras measurements .",
    "figure  2 establishes that the wavelengths used in the present observations sample the bulk of the emission from ngc  1068 .",
    "the arrows in figure  2 indicate upper limits on the flux per octave measured in a gaussian of fwhm equaling the east - west width of ngc  1068 . in the four wavelength bands they represent 35 , 14 , 21 and 21% of the total , and represent estimates of the emission which can be ascribed to an unresolved point source . the estimate is an upper limit since the width of ngc  1068 is certainly greater than the fwhm of the deconvolved psf .",
    "we are forced to the conclusion that only a small fraction of the observed luminosity in ngc  1068 comes from a point like nucleus ; even in close to the central peak there is a significant component of extended emission .",

    "i.e. , the 3  kpc ring contributes only @xmath1one - thirds the bolometric luminosity .",
    "this apparent discrepancy between the keck data and the data of telesco et al . can be attributed to the uncertainties in the models and in the calibrations , including the wide bandwidths , plus the inherent difficulties of observations in the far infrared .",

    "calculations using the thermal parameters of draine & lee ( 1984 ) show that ordinary astronomical graphite grains emitting 0.1  jy at 7.9  @xmath2 m would have to be hotter than 600  k to emit 0.15  jy at 4.8  @xmath2 m .",

    "the wavelength range of the 10.3  @xmath2 m band used in the present observations overlaps about half of this absorption and thus provides a measure of any strong silicate absorption morphology .",
    "figure  5 gives the spectral energy distribution at the five locations shown .",
    "these locations were chosen to approximate local maxima in the 12.5  @xmath2 m image after the four deconvolved images of figure  1 were smoothed to @xmath10.2@xmath0 fwhm .",
    "it should be noted that , because the images at all four wavelengths were smoothed to the lowest resolution , this is a robust result .",
    "the figure shows strong absorption on the peak and just to the south . there is a smooth continuum , perhaps even silicate emission , to the north and northeast .",
    "the most straight forward explanation is that we are seeing an attenuating screen of silicate which is more concentrated over the central peak of mid - infrared emission than in other regions .",
    "the absence of a silicate absorption feature in certain regions of the image could , of course , be due to purely geometrical effects such as the lack of temperature gradients along the line of sight .      in order to estimate the brightness temperature of the central peak , the source size was taken as that area which contained pixels in the deconvolved image with a flux density per pixel greater than half the maximum value .",
    "for the 12.5  @xmath2 m image , that with the best resolution , the size of this area was @xmath10.4  pc ( 0.006  @xmath0 ) and the resulting brightness temperature was 193  k. brightness temperatures for the other wavelengths , similarly defined , ranged from from 118  k at 24.5  @xmath2 m , with a source size @xmath12.7  pc , to 205  k at 7.9  @xmath2 m , with a source size @xmath11.8  pc .    a 12.5 to 24.5  @xmath2 m color temperature was calculated from the deconvolved images at these wavelengths after first smoothing the data to a common fwhm of 0.2@xmath0 . only flux densities per pixel larger than three times the estimated noise per pixel , i.e. 0.03@xmath10[maximum flux density / pixel ] at 12.5 @xmath2 m and 0.12@xmath10[maximum flux density / pixel ] at 24.5 @xmath2 m were used .",
    "the resultant color temperatures , shown in figure  6 , are quite sensitive to the alignment of the two images , but in the central portion are @xmath1265  k. the color temperature is highest in the central peak at 269  k and , significantly , there is no smooth dropping of the temperature along the extended north - south emission . in fact",
    ", the color temperature north of the central peak falls to @xmath1  216  k @xmath10.25@xmath0 ( 20  pc ) north of the peak and then rises again to @xmath1263  k @xmath10.4@xmath0 ( 30  pc ) north of the peak .",
    "calculations using the averaged emissivity parameters of draine & lee ( 1984 ) indicate that an optically thin cloud of pure silicate grains in thermal equilibrium with a central source of 1.5@xmath1010@xmath25l@xmath12 would have 12.5 to 24.5  @xmath2 m color temperatures of 270  k and 220  k at distances of 20 and 30  pc .",
    "if graphite grains were assumed , the color temperatures the same distances from the source would be 320  k and 270  k. the physical temperatures are predicted to be about 10 to 20  k cooler .",
    "thus the measured color temperatures are in the range as expected for heating by a central source , but do not show a smooth behavior with radial distance expected for a uniform distribution of dust grains in such a situation .",
    "an obvious possibility is that the warm emission is from single photon heated small grains .",
    "this has , for example , been invoked in the starburst galaxy m82 to explain an increase in the color temperature with distance from the center ( telesco et al .",
    "although this possibility can not be excluded , we consider it unlikely since if it were the explanation for the warm emission , it would also be necessary to explain why , in figure  5 , there is no sign of the pah emission which is ubiquitous with single photon heating .",
    "of course , beaming of a central source could increase the predicted temperature .",
    "an explanation for the results of antonucci & miller ( 1985 ) could invoke beaming of the central source .",
    "baldwin , wilson & whittle ( 1987 ) have shown that the intensity of the central source could be as much as 200 times greater along the radio axis than to the earth .",
    "if * f * is the `` beaming factor '' by which the luminosity of the central source in the direction of the dust cloud exceeds that towards earth , the resultant temperature would be increased by a factor of * * f**@xmath26 .",
    "thus temperatures as high as 500  k could be obtained with beaming factors in the hundreds , although we do not consider such extreme beaming necessary .",
    "the most prominent feature of the present observations is the highly asymmetric  almost linear  nature of the images , the well resolved extent north - south , and the extreme narrowness east - west .",
    "a dominant feature of this emission is a relatively constant 12.5 to 24.5  @xmath2 m flux ratio or color temperature .",
    "we will designate the narrow lobe to the north of the dashed line in figure  1b as the `` tongue '' .",
    "also prominent is a `` core '' , a name we assign to the region south of the dashed line in figure  1b .",
    "we acknowledge that the dividing line between the two areas is arbitrary and is partially based on the model described below .",
    "the core contains about two - thirds the flux per octave in the mid infrared which we identify with the bolometric luminosity of the central source within an area 4@xmath0 in diameter , while the tongue contains about one - third .",
    "the core is aligned so its north - pointing axis points in a direction slightly west of north while the emission in the tongue curves slightly east of north .    as a corollary to the feature noted above , we emphasize that the mid - infrared observations , by their small extent , convincingly associate a significant fraction , more than half , of the bolometric luminosity of ngc  1068 with an agn rather than with star bursts .",
    "our interpretation of the images is divided into a discussion of the core and a discussion of the tongue .",
    "the core region is itself asymmetrical ; the brightness of the emission in the north of the core is significantly greater than that to the south .",

    "the asymmetric structure of the core image is a natural consequence of the inclination of the plane of the torus to the line of sight .",

    "the model clearly requires significantly deeper silicate absorption in the spectral energy distribution of the southern component compared to that of the northern source in the core .",
    "figure  5 shows silicate absorption at both the southern locations ( positions a and b ) , but whether the extreme southern source displays the increased absorption required to attenuate the signal from the near side of the torus is uncertain , depending on the continuum temperature at the two locations .",
    "the high aspect ratio of the mid - infrared images , and whether the southern lobe we identify as part of the core is indeed associated with a torus remain challenges for torus models to address .",
    "the tongue is a powerful mid - infrared component in ngc  1068 associated with the western boundary of both the [ oiii ] emission and the radio continuum emission ( evans et al .",

    "1994 ; gallimore et al .",
    "1996c ) . on spectral grounds we identify this with re - emission by dust of visual and ultraviolet radiation concentrated in an ionization cone which most likely originates in the nucleus of ngc  1068 .",
    "at this stage we note and comment upon three explanations for the formation of the ionization cone in ngc  1068 .",
    "relativistic beaming : :    the ultraviolet continuum could be produced nonthermally by a pair of    relativistic jets and beamed along the jet direction through    relativistic aberration .",
    "there is no evidence , however , that the jets    associated with seyfert galaxies , in contrast to those associated with    spiral galaxies , are relativistic and we consider that this    explanation is unlikely .",
    "dust absorption : :    the ultraviolet continuum may be produced in a roughly isotropic    source , like an accretion disk , and cool dusty gas at low latitudes ",
    "the torus  then remove most of it only permitting escape along the    two polar directions . as the solid angle subtended by the ionization    cone",
    "is @xmath10.1 of the sky , we would expect the power    radiated by the torus to be at least ten times that associated with    the ionization cone .",
    "we have already shown , however , that the power    re - radiated at mid - infrared wavelengths from the northern ionization    cone is one third that from the core , and this is a lower bound on the    luminosity flowing along the ionization cone . as the core luminosity    is dominated by the mid - infrared power reported here , we conclude that    the core is under - luminous by at least an order of magnitude for dust    absorption to account for the formation of the cones .",
    "( see    storchi - bergmann , mulchaey , & wilson  ( 1992 ) for a related argument . )",
    "electron scattering : :    free electrons have a very high albedo at ultraviolet wavelengths , and    a hot , ionized torus , probably orbiting inside a cool dusty torus will    scatter most of the radiation from an isotropic ultraviolet source    into the polar directions .",
    "this is our favored explanation for the    ionization cone .",
    "( see miller , goodrich & matthews , 1991 . )",
    "note that    the x - ray observations also suggest the presence of a hot torus .",
    "the above picture is strengthened by the observations of capetti et al .",
    "( 1995 ) who measured wavelength - dependent , polarized visual and near ultraviolet continuum emission from the ionization cone which appears to be concentrated at the edges of the radio emission ( capetti et al .",
    "1997 ) , just as in the mid - infrared observations reported here .",
    "this suggests that we are under - estimating the luminosity of the ionization cone .    in view of the energetic considerations given above ,",
    "it is appropriate to compare the potential luminosities with the eddington luminosity of ngc  1068 .",
    "the eddington luminosity is based on the observations of gallimore et al .",
    "( 1996b ) and greenhill et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who used water maser emission lines to estimate the mass of the black hole in ngc  1068 .",
    "unfortunately , the estimates of the two groups differ by a factor of three .",
    "gallimore et al.s measurements result in an eddington luminosity of 1@xmath1010@xmath9l@xmath12 while those of greenhill et al",
    ". give 3@xmath1010@xmath25l@xmath12 .",
    "both these luminosities are less than the putative isotropic bolometric luminosity of @xmath2225@xmath1010@xmath25l@xmath12 derived above , but we can strongly discount this value only if we accept greenhill et al.s value of the black hole mass .",
    "it should be noted that either value of the eddington luminosity is only somewhat larger than the total mid - infrared luminosity suggesting that the accretion onto the black hole is almost eddington - limited and that any gas within the ionization cone will be accelerated outward by radiation pressure as the flux there must exceed the eddington flux .",
    "the radiation pressure should also sweep the ionization cone clean of dust , although there is evidence ( miller et al .",
    "1991 ) that the grains are continuously being replenished .",
    "the time scale for such clearing would be quite short so an evacuated cone with dust at the edges might result .",
    "thus , with the exception of the dust in a hypothesized central torus , the mid - infrared emitting dust would be distributed in a thin shell around the surface of the ionization cone , and thereby appear as linear features since the line - of - sight path length is maximized at the edges of the shell .",
    "the observations would most likely imply a very patchy shell .",
    "this would obviate the need to invoke any beaming of the ultraviolet radiation which heats the dust , other than the relatively broad ionization cone .    although the morphological resemblance of the radio and mid - infrared emitting regions might suggest the radio jet being the heating source of the dust in the tongue , we argue that this is unlikely based on the energetics .",
    "observation shows that the plasma responsible for the scattering of the agn light is moving outward from the nucleus at a velocity of 3001200 km / s ( miller et al .",
    "if we take this plasma velocity as the shock speed , mid - infrared emission can be produced by shocks in this flow through two dust - heating mechanisms : direct collisions between the plasma and dust particles ( draine 1981 ) and absorption of ultraviolet radiation produced by the post - shock cooling plasma ( cf . dopita & sutherland 1996 ) . however , unless the efficiency of converting the shock energy into infrared emission is extremely high , we can not avoid the conclusion that this shock carries a mechanical luminosity comparable to the eddington limit , which seems unlikely .",
    "there is no evidence that jets in seyfert galaxies are this luminous .",
    "furthermore , regardless of which mechanism dominates the dust heating , such a fast shock is bound to produce a substantial ultraviolet radiation .",
    "therefore , the absence of strong ultraviolet sources near the mid - infrared emitting region ( recall that the ultraviolet radiation in the nuclear region is mostly scattered agn light ) also argues against the shock heating by the radio jet unless the ultraviolet radiation is perfectly shielded by dust .    our picture ,",
    "then , is of a thick , radiation - dominated accretion disk close to the central black hole that emits an ultraviolet power somewhat larger than the total mid - infrared luminosity which , primarily through electron scattering , with perhaps some dust absorption , is collimated into a pair of roughly anti - parallel cones .",
    "it is likely that these cones are not just framed by a single accretion torus but are defined successively on many scales from the radius of the black hole to the radius of the narrow line region .",
    "indeed , the partial occultation of the ionization cone by the dense , dusty gas that we are observing may be just a final stage in this process .",
    "why is the mid - infrared emission only found mainly on one side of the ionization cone and the radio jet ?",
    "we suspect that this is because the gas flow on all scales may be quite irregular and the beam of the ionizing radiation is far from axisymmetric .",
    "precession of the central accretion disk may also contribute to this outcome .",
    "this can also account for the otherwise surprising observation that the color temperature actually increases along the tongue .",
    "suppose that the intensity in the northern ionization cone is quite non - uniform due to the irregular scattering and absorption associated with its formation .",
    "the hotter dust observed near the end of the tongue might then be associated with an unusually intense pencil impacting a dense and dusty cloud , where the radiation flux is larger than the radiation flux that heats dust closer to the core despite the inverse square law dilution . in this way",
    ", we believe that we can account qualitatively for the observed morphology from radio to ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "if the interpretation presented above survives further scrutiny , it suggests an explanation as to why seyfert galaxies ( and most quasars ) are radio - quiet ( not silent ) .",
    "specifically the radiation drag close to the black hole and within the ionization cone may prevent the outflow from attaining ultra - relativistic speed .",
    "future observations of other nearby seyfert galaxies will be necessary to see if total luminosities are as large as found for ngc  1068 .    in order to substantiate this picture",
    "it would be useful to show that the agn has sufficient x - ray , ultraviolet , and visual luminosity to provide for the observed mid - infrared luminosity .",
    "observations of visual polarization , like those of capetti et al  ( 1995 ) , should be able to give this since it is presumably due to dust scattering .",
    "if we assume that the grains are similar to galactic grains , their blue polarized flux should correlate with the mid - infrared flux .",
    "we can use the albedo and polarization expected from dust scattering to estimate the luminosity absorbed . this should give a lower limit on the luminosity in the ionization cone ..    the luminosities measured in the present images are , as noted , close to the eddington luminosity for ngc  1068 . if the tight correlation between the bulge velocity dispersion and black hole mass ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) is substantiated , black hole masses may be inferred in other galaxies from velocity dispersion measurements . by comparing the corresponding eddington luminosity with the agn luminosity derived from infrared observations similar to those presented here , we will be able to determine which agn are accreting at the eddington rate .",
    "this should enhance our understanding of how black holes are fueled in galactic nuclei .",
    "finally , a consequence of the picture presented above is that a significant fraction of the luminosity of ngc  1068 is not associated with a torus _ per se _ , but is produced by re - processing radiation with dusty gas located @xmath140  pc away from the central source whose characteristics may be unique to ngc  1068 .",
    "this complexity makes any interpretation of agns invoking a common morphology more difficult .",
    "\\1 ) mid - infrared observations of ngc  1068 at the diffraction limit of the keck 10-m telescope show a bright core containing about 1/3 the total flux accompanied by north - south emission about 70  pc long which is unresolved in the east west direction .",
    "thus most of the emission from the nuclear region of ngc  1068 comes from the elongated , highly asymmetric north - south structure .",

    "the deconvolution of the one psf by the other is shown in figure  8 .",
    "we chose to deconvolve the psf with larger average airmass by the psf with the lower average airmass to illustrate the maximum error . since the fwhm of the psf observed at a lower airmass",
    "is always slightly smaller than that of the psf with a higher airmass , the reverse deconvolution gives significantly better results .",
    "the deconvolved psfs are ellipsoidal , with fwhm in the extended direction that ranges from 1.5 to 2 times that of the deconvolved psfs presented in figure  1 .",
    "the largest spurious features in figure  8 appear at 3% of the peak brightness , due to incomplete cancellation of the first airy diffraction ring .    as a further test",
    ", images of ngc  1068 were deconvolved with a mismatched calibrator . as shown in figure  8 ,",
    "a combined image of ngc  1068 observed in sequence with hr  1457 , and deconvolved using the psf from hr  0911 ( ngc  1068 # 3 ) was formed .",
    "the remaining observations of ngc  1068 were deconvolved using the psf from hr  1457 ( ngc  1068 # 4 ) .",
    "the two deconvolved images gave similar results , although the ngc  1068 image and the psf were mismatched in airmass as much as possible , and well separated in time .",
    "finally , as a severe test of the systematic uncertainty , the image of ngc  1068 from the night of 3  october was deconvolved by the psf from 1  october ( ngc  1068 # 5 ) and the 1  october observations of ngc  1068 were deconvolved by the psf from 3  october ( ngc  1068 # 6 ) .",
    "although these results are less satisfactory , as might be expected , the general morphology is clearly preserved .",
    "both these deconvolved images of the ngc  1068 and the psf illustrate the maximum effect of systematic error due to changes in the psf with time and elevation angle .",
    "both the differential average airmass and time separation between raw image and psf are many times better for the images presented in figure  1 .    as a final test ,",
    "images of ngc  1068 and a psf star ( irc  + 00  032 ) were obtained on 27  january , 2000 using a different mid - infrared camera , the lws ( jones & puetter 1993 ) on the keck  1  10-m telescope .",
    "lws provides nyquist - sampling of the airy function with 0.08@xmath0 pixels .",
    "unfortunately , on the night of the observations the seeing was approximately twice the diffraction - limited resolution .",
    "one hundred and ninety two observations , in six groups of 32 observations and each of 1 sec exposure time , were taken of ngc  1068 interleaved with similar observations of the psf star .",
    "the 10% of each set of @xmath1  200 observations with the smallest fwhm were selected and the images coadded ; these coadded images were used to obtain a deconvolved image of ngc  1068 ( figure  8) that bears a good resemblance to the images obtained with mirlin .",
    "the detectability and stability of a source near the main peak in the deconvolved image may be tested by creating a synthesized image , whereby a faint point source is added to the raw ngc  1068 image . if the psf is systematically different in the psf and ngc  1068 images , the deconvolved synthesized image may be expected to change the flux density and position of the faint point source .",
    "a point source based on the deconvolving psf with a flux density ranging from 10% - 0.5% of the flux density of ngc  1068 was placed at positions @xmath10.5@xmath0 east and west of the nucleus .",
    "the point source was generally recovered in the deconvolved image with relatively little change in flux density or position down to the 0.5% level at 7.9 , 10.3 , and 12.5  @xmath2 m , and down to the 2.0% level at 24.5  @xmath2 m .",
    "these levels are consistent with the contours chosen in figure 1 .",
    "if the point source is inserted closer to the nucleus ( 0.3@xmath0 to the east or west ) , the flux density and position are still recovered in the deconvolved image .",
    "the deconvolved resolution appears to slightly degrade so that peak surface brightness is about two times lower .",
    "these tests were also performed using an independent psf ( hr  0334 ) in the synthesized image . in this case , the resolution of the point source was somewhat lower , as expected .",
    "however , the flux density and position are recovered with similar accuracy as before .",
    "based on these tests , the estimated uncertainty in the photometry of a source placed 0.3@xmath0  0.6@xmath0 east or west of the nucleus , evaluated in a 0.3@xmath280.3@xmath0 artificial beam , is @xmath70.5% of the total flux density at 7.9 and 12.5  @xmath2 m .",
    "similar tests were also performed on the lws images described in appendix a with worse image recovery than with the mirlin data .",
    "the seeing conditions when the lws data were taken were significantly poorer than when the mirlin data were obtained and limited the reliability of the lws data .",
