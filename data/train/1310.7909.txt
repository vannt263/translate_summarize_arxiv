    "recent work in the area of the @xmath2-manifold invariants called _ knot homologies _ has illuminated the relationship between floer - theoretic knot homologies and ` quantum ' knot homologies .",
    "the relationships observed take the form of spectral sequences starting with a quantum invariant and abutting to a floer invariant .",
    "a primary example is due to ozsvth and szab @xcite in which a spectral sequence is constructed from khovanov homology of a knot ( with @xmath3 coefficients ) to the heegaard - floer homology of the 3-manifold obtained as double branched cover over the knot .",
    "a later example is due to kronheimer and mrowka which gives a spectral sequence @xcite from khovanov homology to an instanton knot floer homology .",
    "there are automatically naturality questions about such spectral sequences .",
    "both the quantum homology and the floer homology involved exhibit some functoriality with respect to link cobordism , and one can ask if the spectral sequences behave well with respect to this functoriality . the project of demonstrating such naturality is important , but in this paper we are able to use the limited naturality already available ( essentially naturality for cobordisms presented as a movie of elementary @xmath0-handle additions ) to make some computations .",
    "the basic idea is that if we are interested in the floer homology of a knot @xmath4 , we find a cobordism to a knot @xmath5 with a simple spectral sequence and then use the quantum homology of @xmath5 to draw conclusions on the floer homology of @xmath4 .",
    "we are restricting ourselves to the spectral sequences of ozsvth - szab and kronheimer - mrowka , but the technique should have wider applicability . in the next section we review these floer homologies , section 3 then deals with the spectral sequences , and section 4",
    "contains the computations .    a word of warning : as a matter of notational convenience , our floer theoretic invariant of a knot or link or 3-manifold is really what in the literature would be the floer invariant of the mirror image of a knot or link or 3-manifold .",
    "this avoids permanent use of the word ` mirror ' in the spectral sequences that we study .",
    "we thank peter kronheimer for helpful email correspondence .",
    "we also thank cirm where we started this project in a research in pairs program in march this year .",
    "the first author thanks liam watson .",
    "the first author was partially supported by epsrc grant ep / k00591x/1 .",
    "while khovanov homology is very simply defined and heegaard - floer homology for many is a relatively comfortable object , instanton floer homology is far less known . therefore we are going to assume familiarity with khovanov homology and devote the first subsection merely to quoting a result from heegaard - floer , while the remaining subsections give a review of the relevant instanton floer homology .",
    "we will work with the reduced homology theories .      in this paper",
    "we are concerned with @xmath6 , the ` hat ' version of heegaard - floer homology @xcite .",

    "it is a quick check that if @xmath4 is a knot with thin khovanov homology then the rank of @xmath15 is exactly @xmath19 and hence the spectral sequence collapses at the @xmath12-page .",

    "hence the rank of this map is at most @xmath159 , and we have drawn the @xmath159 possibly non - zero components of this map .",
    "we split the cobordism @xmath174 into the composition of two cobordisms @xmath180 and @xmath181 where @xmath180 is a cobordism obtained by adding a @xmath0-handle to @xmath155 to obtain a 2-component link @xmath18 , and where @xmath181 is obtained by adding a 1-handle to @xmath18 to obtain the knot @xmath4 .",
    "we can think of @xmath18 as being obtained by taking the vertical smoothing of a crossing between the first two strands of a standard braid presentation of @xmath155 .",
