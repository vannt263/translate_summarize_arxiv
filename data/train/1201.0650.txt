    "luorescence microscopy is a fundamental tool in basic and applied biomedical research . because of its optical sensitivity and molecular specificity ,",
    "it is employed in an increasing number of applications which , in turn , are continuously driving the development of advanced microscopy systems that provide imaging data with ever higher spatio - temporal resolution and multiplexing capabilities . in fluorescence microscopy",
    ", one can schematically distinguish two kinds of imaging approaches , differing by their excitation and detection modalities @xcite . in wide - field ( wf ) microscopy , a large sample area is illuminated and the emitted light is recorded on a multi - detector array , such as a ccd camera . in contrast , in raster scan ( rs ) microscopy , a point excitation is scanned through the sample and a point detector is used to detect the fluorescence signal at each position .    while very distinct in their implementation and applications , these imaging modalities have in common that the acquisition is independent of the information content of the image .",
    "rather , the number of measurements , either serial in rs or parallel in wf , is imposed by the nyquist - shannon theorem .",
    "this theorem states that the sampling frequency ( namely the inverse of the image pixel size ) must be twice the bandwidth of the signal , which is determined by the diffraction limit of the microscope lens equal to @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the optical wavelength and @xmath2 the objective numerical aperture ) . yet",
    ", most images , including those of biological interest , can be described by a number of parameters much lower than the total number of pixels . in everyday s world , a striking consequence of this compressibility is the ability of consumer cameras with several megapixel detectors to routinely reduce the number of bits in a raw data file by an order of magnitude or two without substantial information loss . to quote from david brady : `` if it is possible to compress measured data , one might argue that too many measurements were taken '' @xcite .",
    "the recent mathematical theory of _ compressed _ or _ compressive sensing _",
    "( cs  see @xcite ) has addressed this challenge and shown how the sensing modality could be modified to reduce the sampling rate of objects which are sparse in the sense that their information content is lower than the total bandwidth or the number of pixels suggest .",
    "the fact that one can sample such signals non - adaptively and without much information loss  if any at all  at a rate close to the image information content ( instead of the total bandwidth ) has important consequences , especially in applications where sensing modalities are slow or costly . to be sure",
    ", the applications of cs theory to data acquisition are rapidly growing in fields as diverse as medical resonance imaging @xcite , analog - to - digital conversion @xcite or astronomy @xcite .    in optics ,",
    "the interest in cs has been originally spurred by the demonstration of the so - called `` single - pixel camera '' @xcite . since then",
    ", reports have explored the potential of cs for visible and infrared imaging @xcite , holography @xcite or ghost imaging @xcite . in microscopy , the feasibility of cs measurements has recently been demonstrated @xcite . altogether , these results open exciting prospects , notably for the important case of biomedical imaging .",
    "having said this , there are very few results about the performance of cs hardware devices on relevant biological samples .",
    "as such samples often have low fluorescence , it is especially important to understand how the associated noise will affect the acquisition and reconstruction schemes .    in this paper , we describe compressive fluorescence microscopy ( cfm ) , a novel modality for fluorescence biological and hyperspectral imaging based on the concepts of cs theory . in cfm , the sample",
    "is excited with a patterned illumination and its fluorescence is collected on a point detector .",
    "images are computationally reconstructed from measurements corresponding to a set of appropriately chosen patterns . therefore , cfm benefits from many advantages associated with rs techniques , namely , high dynamic range , facilitated multiplexing , and wide spectral range ( from the uv to the ir ) .",
    "in truth , the benefits of cs are particularly appealing in biology where fast , high - resolution and multicolor imaging is highly sought after .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by recalling the principles of cs theory for optical imaging .",
    "we then turn to the description of the practical implementation of cfm and of the sensing protocol .",
    "our techniques are subsequently applied to image several relevant samples , including fluorescent beads , cultured cells and tissues . by extending our implementation",
    ", we further demonstrate the possibility of hyperspectral acquisition with up to 128 different spectral channels .",
    "a final contribution is a careful study of various noise trade - offs for cfm .",
    "we conclude the paper with a discussion of prospective cfm developments .",

    "we say that the signal is @xmath11-sparse if at most @xmath11 of these coefficients are nonzero .",
    "an empirical fact is that most images of interest are well approximated by @xmath11-sparse expansions with @xmath11 much less than the number of pixels @xmath12 , and this is the reason why data compression is effective ; one can store and transmit quantizations of the large coefficients , ignore the small ones , and suffer little distortion .    in our imaging setup ,",

    "wide - field and point - like excitation are two extreme cases , corresponding respectively to a uniform sensing waveform ( @xmath17=1 $ ] for all @xmath6 ) and to a spike or dirac waveform .    in its simplest form",
    ", cs theory asserts that if the signal @xmath5 is sparse in the representation @xmath7 , then only few measurements of the form are sufficient for perfect recovery provided the sensing and representation waveforms , respectively @xmath13 and @xmath9 , are _ incoherent _ @xcite .",
    "two systems are said to be incoherent if any element in one of the two can not be expressed as a sparse linear combination of elements taken from the other .",
    "formally , the coherence between two orthobases @xmath7 and @xmath14 of @xmath18 is measured by the parameter @xmath19 ranging between @xmath20 and @xmath12 : @xmath21    the fourier and dirac bases are in this sense maximally incoherent ( we need many spikes to synthesize a sinusoid and vice versa ) and @xmath22 . on the opposite , two identical bases are maximally coherent and , in this case , @xmath23 .",
    "hence , incoherence expresses the idea of the level of dissimilarity between any two representations of a signal . with this in mind , one perceives how each incoherent measurement ",
    "a projection on an element of the basis @xmath14conveys a little bit of information about all the entries of the coefficient vector @xmath24 .",
    "an important result in cs theory states that @xmath11-sparse signals can be recovered exactly from comparably few measurements in an incoherent system .",
    "further , recovery is achieved by solving a tractable optimization program  a linear program .",
    "one solves @xmath25 when @xmath26 measurements are chosen uniformly at random from the basis @xmath14 , the recovery is exact with very high probability ; that is , the solution sequence @xmath27 obeys @xmath28 \\mathbf{w_p } = \\mathbf{x}$ ] , provided that @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant on the order of unity .",
    "this result emphasizes both the role of the coherence and the potential gain for large images due to the logarithmic dependence in the pixel size . for incoherent pairs ,",
    "we only need on the order of @xmath31 random samples .",
    "we have discussed sparse signals above for ease of exposition .",
    "however , the theory extends to approximately sparse signals and to noisy data .",
    "for instance , if the signal is well approximated by a @xmath11-sparse signal ( some would say that it is compressible ) , then the reconstruction error is shown to be small .",
    "further , the recovery is not sensitive to noise in the sense that the error degrades gracefully as the signal - to - noise ratio decreases .",

    "spatially modulated excitation patterns , we incorporated a digital micromirror device ( dmd ) in a conjugate image plane of the excitation path .",
    "the dmd is a 1024-by-768 array of micromirrors ( texas - instrument discovery 4100 , vialux , germany ) of size 13.68x13.68 @xmath32 m each , and which can be shifted between two positions oriented at + 12@xmath33 or -12@xmath33 with respect to the dmd surface .",
    "they are all independently configurable at frequency up to 20 khz .",
    "the dmd is carefully positioned so that the optical axis ( defined by the microscope lens and the dichroic mirror dm ( figure [ set - up]a ) ) is orthogonal to the plane of the dmd .        as light source , we used a laser bench ( roper scientific , france ) equipped with two superimposed continuous - wave laser ( @xmath1=488 nm , coherent , usa and @xmath1=561 nm , cobolt , sweden ) .",
    "the laser beam first passed through a rotating diffuser or a phase scrambler ( dyoptika , ireland ) in order to reduce the spatial coherence and was then coupled to a 200@xmath34 multimode fiber . at the fiber output ,",
    "the laser beam was expanded into a 2 cm diameter collimated beam .",
    "this beam was oriented towards the dmd at an angle of incidence corresponding to twice the tilting angle of the dmd mirrors ( approx .",
    "24@xmath33 ) ; a micromirror oriented at + 12@xmath33 would reflect the light into the microscope and appear as a bright pixel in the sample plane and , inversely , micromirrors oriented at -12@xmath33 appear as dark pixels .",
    "depending on the samples , we used an air ( nikon , 20x , plan apo vc na 0.75 ) or an oil - immersion objective ( nikon , 60x plan apo tirf , na 1.45 ) .",
    "when the 20x air lens was used , the imaging lenses ( lenses @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 in figure [ set - up]a ) were chosen to introduce a 1.5x reduction .",
    "the overall magnification of the image of the dmd on the sample was 1/30 and the size of a single micromirror equal to 456 nm .",
    "when the 60x lens was used , a different set of imaging lenses was chosen which only served as a 1x relay ; here , the image size of a single micromirror in the sample plane was equal to 228 nm . upon illumination with an intensity pattern ( excitation intensity @xmath38 20 to 60 w/@xmath39 ) , the sample fluorescence was detected on a photomultiplier tube pmt ( hamamatsu ) and sampled at 96khz using an analog - digital converter board ( pci-4462 , national instruments , usa ) ( figure [ set - up]b - d ) . in cs measurements , the information on the sample is thus contained in the variations of the intensity signal as a function of the illumination pattern ( figure [ set - up]e ) .",
    "the wf image of the sample could also be directly formed on a camera ( imagem , hamamatsu , japan ) placed on the output port of the microscope .",
    "for hyperspectral imaging , the pmt was replaced by a fast and sensitive spectral detector described later in the paper .",
    "note that the role of the dmd in our set - up differs from that in the `` single - pixel camera '' @xcite or in some other microscopy setups @xcite . in the latter",
    ", the modulator is placed between the sample and the detector , meaning that it is used to select some of the light within the total signal , rather than to control the excitation pattern .",
    "our choice is motivated by the low level of fluorescence encountered in biological samples such as living cells labelled with fluorescent proteins .",
    "indeed , the overall efficiency of a dmd is 68% and falls down to 34% when only one half of the mirrors are tilted . in our case ,",
    "the photon collection efficiency is only limited by the numerical aperture of the microscope lens and the quantum yield of the detector as in conventional epifluorescence microscopy .",

    "an appealing choice for @xmath14 is then the hadamard system known to be incoherent with the dirac basis and fine scale wavelets .",

    "figures [ set - up]c and d represent wf images of a hadamard pattern projected on a uniform and on a biological sample .",
    "a specificity of optical imaging is that the sensing elements @xmath13 represent light intensities and are thus nonnegative which , as discussed later , has important practical implications .",
    "hadamard waveforms have a sort of spatial frequency ( like sinusoids ) which grossly depends on the typical block size of the patterns . as the power spectrum of most biological images",
    "is generally concentrated at low frequencies , the flexibility in frequency selection is important .",
    "we introduce two distinct pattern selection strategies based on the expected spatial content of the sample :    * when the sample we wish to acquire is sparse in the pixel domain as in the case of single molecule or bead imaging , no typical frequency range needs to be favored and hadamard patterns are selected uniformly at random . *",
    "more complex samples have a power spectrum typically decaying like a power law .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in the current implementation of cfm , we neglected the role of the point spread function ( psf ) of the excitation pathway ( corresponding to the lenses @xmath75 and @xmath37 and the objective ) and used the idealized matrix with zeros and ones ( depending whether a pixel is illuminated or not ) for the inversion . in reality , the psf acts as a low pass filter , meaning that those patterns illuminating the sample are spatially smoother than their theoretical counterparts . in the framework of cs , it is well known that recovering a compressed signal from a sensing matrix that departs from the real one may , in general , dramatically degrade the reconstruction quality . in our case , however , this approximation only has minor consequences .",
    "this holds for essentially two reasons . in our experiments ,",
    "the individual pixel size of the hadamard patterns was at least twice as large as the diffraction - limit of the microscope .",
    "in other words , the psf only has a minor filtering impact on the patterns .",
    "second , neglecting the effect of the psf in the reconstruction does not dramatically reduce the quality of reconstruction . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath76 be the psf of the lens so that the collected fluorescence is of the form @xmath77 ( we measure the dot product between the object of interest and the theoretical patterns convolved with the psf ) .",
    "if the psf is symmetric around the origin , we have @xmath78 in which @xmath79 is the linear convolution with the psf .",
    "hence , neglecting the psf recovers a signal @xmath80 obeying @xmath81 ; in other words , one gets @xmath82 which is @xmath83 at the resolution of the microscope . indeed , assuming that the lenses the excitation and emission psfs are identical , the csm has the same resolution as its wide - field equivalent .",
    "now if one wishes to account for the psf , one would need to solve a joint decompression  deconvolution problem . if the deconvolution should provide a higher resolution image , it is well - known that it is usually at the cost of noise amplification . here again , the sparsity prior used for decompression should of course help regularizing this deconvolution step .",
    "[ [ noise - and - mse . ] ] noise and mse .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + +    it is crucial to examine noise figures in our setup .",
    "there are two important facts affecting the quality of reconstruction : the noise distribution associated with cs - type data and the undersampling ratio .",
    "we assume below that photonic noise is the limiting source of noise , an assumption which sets cs - based optical systems apart from the common theoretical cs framework @xcite . to understand the important trade - offs",
    ", we compare the respective situations of rs and cs , two point detection imaging techniques .",
    "below , we put @xmath84 and @xmath85 for the excitation intensity per unit area and per unit time during rs and cs acquisition .",
    "likewise , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are durations of excitation ( for a single measurement ) .",
    "finally , we set @xmath88 and similarly for @xmath89 . in practice",
    ", all these parameter values are adjusted according to factors that one wants to optimize ( acquisition speed , sensitivity , photobleaching and so on ) and they must be evaluated on a case by case basis . hence , rather than an exhaustive comparison of the relative merits of rs and cs acquisition , the discussion below aims at providing a general framework to understand the nature of the noise in cs measurements .    in the case of rs , the @xmath6th pixel measurement is distributed as a poisson random variable with mean and variance @xmath90 $ ] . using the scaled observed data yields a per - pixel mse equal to    @xmath91 - x[i])^2 = { \\lambda_{\\text{rs}}}^{-1 } \\times \\bar x ,   \\ ] ] where @xmath92 $ ] . for cs ,",
    "suppose first that we collect all hadamard measurements ( no undersampling ) .",
    "each measurement is an independent poisson variable with mean @xmath93 . with patterns of the form @xmath94 where @xmath41 is a hadamard sequence",
    ", one can decompose the mean value of @xmath16 , as @xmath95.\\ ] ] hence , this is the sum of a dc offset and a fourier - like component .",
    "the presence of the dc offset ( which prevents the optical patterns from being negative ) impacts the data snr .",
    "indeed , a possible source of concern is that for many high - frequency components , @xmath96 may be much greater than the magnitude of @xmath97the dc component dominates the high - frequency coefficients .",
    "therefore , when measuring a high - frequency component , we need to deal with a large amount of noise coming from the average fluorescence of the sample under study .",
    "this situation is arguably very different than in other applications  for instance , the acquisition of radio - frequency signals  where one can use sensing waveforms that take on negative values by switching the phase of the object we wish to acquire @xcite . inverting the hadamard matrix",
    "gives a noisy image @xmath98 $ ] obeying @xmath99 = x[i ] \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\text{var}(\\hat x[i ] ) = \\frac{2}{{\\lambda_{\\text{cs } } } } \\bar x\\ ] ] ( see the appendix for details ) .",
    "in contrast to rs microscopy , we see that cfm yields a spatially invariant noise level in the pixel domain . in other words , by measuring the image projection on an incoherent basis , the noise gets spread equally over all the pixels . hence , before applying any processing , the cs situation is more favorable for recovering brighter areas but less so for dimmer regions .",
    "summing up gives @xmath100 this analysis also shows that it is essential to minimize the sources of signal which could contribute to a constant background and increase @xmath101 .",
    "this offset could be due to the nature of the sample itself but can also originate from stray light or out - of - focus fluorescence .",
    "these considerations explain , at least qualitatively , why the _ beads _ sample , where the background @xmath101 is low compared to the bright spots and is purely bi - dimensional , is favorable for cfm .    to consider the effect of statistical estimation procedures or data processing ,",
    "consider the _ beads _",
    "sample again in which sparsely distributed beads are located in the field of view . each bead is an isolated bright spot surrounded by wide non - fluorescent areas .",
    "suppose then that we were to apply a thresholding estimator , setting to zero all intensities below a certain level , and keeping those above threshold .",
    "then one would obtain a very low mse in the cs setting since dark pixels would be correctly set to zero while bright pixels would have a variance that is orders of magnitude lower than that achievable in the rs case . in short , thresholding would effectively filter out the off - support noise and the situation would be extremely favorable to the cs approach .",
    "quantitatively , if there are @xmath11 bright pixels , the error after estimation for rs and cs would behave like @xmath102 note the potentially enormous reduction in mse by the factor @xmath103 .",
    "conversely , rs would be more effective for smooth and bright images ( sparse images in the frequency domain ) .",
    "the comparisons between rs and cs microscopy above are valid as long as the same illumination intensity per pixel is assumed and the number of measurements @xmath26 is equal to the number of pixels .",
    "we now discuss the effect of undersampling . now",
    "the cs recovery is both an inversion and a denoising algorithm and the recovery error depends on the compressibility of the signal ( on how sparse it is ) .",
    "for instance , in the fully sampled case where sparsity is assumed in the spatial domain , the cs recovery would essentially invert the hadamard matrix and then apply soft - thresholding to the output .",
    "now suppose for simplicity that the signal is @xmath11-sparse and that the number @xmath26 of measurements is sufficient for perfect recovery from noiseless data .",
    "then the squared recovery error from @xmath26 noisy measurements as above would roughly scale like @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a small numerical constant ( typically on the order of unity ) .",
    "hence , the main difference with the mse available from a full sample is a loss of a factor @xmath106the undersampling ratio  in the mse , compare . in other words",
    ", halving the number of samples  everything else , namely , intensity and duration of excitation remaining the same  doubles the mse .",
    "the same conclusion applies for approximately sparse signals for which the variance component of the mse dominates the squared bias .",
    "here again , the more compressible the signal ( the smaller @xmath11 ) , the better the performance ( e.  g.  the _ beads _",
    "sample is favorable to cfm ) .",
    "we would like to also note that @xmath107 is still much smaller than one so that even though we are sampling less , we may still end up with a much better mse than in rs .    to summarize ,",
    "cfm is effective when : 1 ) the most informative parts of the sample are brighter than its mean value and 2 ) the sample is highly compressible . notice that while these two requirements are sample dependent , the second gives some flexibility since one can select a representation in which a class of signals has an optimally sparse representation .",
    "[ [ impact - of - the - sample - thickness . ] ] impact of the sample thickness .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    one important issue in cfm has to do with the patterned illumination of thick fluorescent samples .",
    "indeed , with a wide - field linear excitation , the illumination propagates throughout the sample and causes the entire volume to fluoresce . since the optical transfer function of a circular aperture ( such as a microscope lens ) has a bandwidth that decreases with defocusing @xcite , the contrast of the pattern diminishes away from the focal plane . as a result , the fluorescence coming from out - of - focus planes is not modulated as a function of the patterns .",
    "in fact , this property serves as basis for optical sectioning in structured illumination microscopy ( sim ) @xcite . in the case of cfm",
    ", the off - focus signal contributes to an offset signal on the detector , which , as explained above , tends to significantly degrade the quality of the reconstruction .",
    "a few strategies can be considered to add sectioning capabilities to cs based imaging systems @xcite , @xcite @xcite .",
    "one recently demonstrated approach is based on the rejection of the off - focus signal , in a way similar to that of a programmable array microscope @xcite .",
    "another method is to avoid generating any off - focus signal at all .",
    "we demonstrated it for photoactivation using an evanescent - wave ( figure [ cells_pollen ] ) and this can be extended to 2d activation within the sample volume with two - photon temporal focusing activation @xcite or light sheet illumination @xcite .",
    "in the long - term , an even better strategy is to illuminate with an incoherent basis of 3d patterns and , subsequently , to directly reconstruct the sample in 3d .",
    "this paper presented the principles and implementation of compressive sensing in fluorescence microscopy together with its applications in biomedical imaging .",
    "our approach , which is based on a patterned excitation of the sample combined with a point - detection of the emitted fluorescence , readily allows for substantial undersampling gains when compared to traditional raster - scanning approaches .",
    "it could also be useful in situations , such as a diffusing media , where direct imaging on a multi - pixel detector is not possible .",
    "furthermore , we have set forth a distinctive prospect for hyperspectral acquisition , which has great potential for multicolor single molecule imaging . more generally , the acquisition of 3d , 4d ( three spatial dimensions and one spectral or temporal dimension ) or even higher dimensional signals puts unrealistic constraints on system resources .",
    "it is indeed hard to imagine that one would want to sample such huge data cubes at rates anywhere close to the shannon rate .",
    "the key is that multidimensional signals become increasingly redundant in the sense that their information content grows at a much lower rate than the number of voxels .",
    "for example , movies are comparably far more compressible than still pictures .",
    "likewise , hyperspectral movies are far more redundant than monochromatic movies , and so on",
    ". expressed differently , the ratio between the number of degrees of freedom and the number of voxels decreases very rapidly as the dimension increases .",
    "the extreme sparsity of higher dimensional signals can not be ignored and we expect the advantages of cfm to become paramount in such applications .",
    "this short appendix justifies our snr calculations , and we begin by introducing some notation .",
    "we denote by @xmath108 the hadamard matrix and by @xmath109 the vector with all entries equal to one .",
    "hence , acquiring all hadamard patterns gives us independent poisson variables with means @xmath110 here , we set @xmath111 as the general case can be obtained via a simple rescaling .",
    "hence , our estimate is of the form @xmath112 and it is easy to verify that @xmath113 in which @xmath114 .",
    "( observe that the first entry is a bit special here  a pixel at this location is always illuminated  and that we could always shift the hadamard matrix as to select any _ special _ pixel . ) since @xmath115 , we have @xmath116 .",
    "further , @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the covariance matrix of the random vector @xmath119 . since @xmath120 is the diagonal matrix with entries @xmath121 , we have @xmath122 ) = \\sum_{j = 1}^n |s^{-1}[i , j]|^2 \\ , d_j.\\ ] ] to proceed , one verifies that @xmath123| = \\begin{cases } \\frac{n}{2 } -1 , & ( i , j ) = ( 1,1 ) , \\\\    1 , & ( i , j ) \\neq ( 1,1 ) , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] and that @xmath124)$ ] together with @xmath125 .",
    "plugging in gives @xmath122 )   = \\begin{cases }   ( n - 2 ) \\bar x + \\frac{2}{n } x[1 ] ,   & i = 1,\\\\    2\\bar x + \\frac{2}{n } x[1 ] , & i \\neq 1 \\end{cases}\\ ] ] ( again this highlights the role played by the special pixel ) .",
    "now suppose that the special pixel is chosen so that there is no probe at this location ( which can always be arranged )",
