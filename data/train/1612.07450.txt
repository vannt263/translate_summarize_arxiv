    "the scattering fraction of ugc 5101 is similar to , and even larger than , the median values of an [ o  iii]@xmath148 selected sample ( @xmath149 ; @xcite ) and a hard x - ray ( 14195 kev ) selected sample ( @xmath150 ; @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "we note , however , that given the large error in the scattering fraction and possible contamination by emission from high mass x - ray binaries in the host galaxy , we can not make strong arguments based on the @xmath52 value .",
    "these results imply that the nucleus in ugc 5101 can not be fully surrounded by compton - thick matter",
    ". nevertheless , there could be the possibility that a lower column - density ( compton - thin ) absorber is present in the torus - hole regions that attenuates the nuclear ionizing uv emission and causing the under - developed nlr in ugc 5101 ( section 1 ) . by our analysis",
    ", we indeed find that a weak intrinsic x - ray absorption ( @xmath151 @xmath1 , * zphabs1 * in section  3 ) , in addition to the compton - thick absorber , is required when the data below 0.7 kev , which are sensitive to determine such an absorption , are included in the fit ( i.e. , models  ia and ib ) . by assuming a galactic dust - to - gas ratio , this column density corresponds to an optical extinction of @xmath152 mag ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is sufficient to block a large fraction of ionizing uv lights from the central engine of the agn , although we can not discard the possibility that the absorption could be associated to interstellar medium of the host galaxy on a larger scale .",
    "to further investigate the nuclear geometry and intrinsic spectral energy distribution , we compare the luminosity of an emission line from the nlr and the agn x - ray luminosity .",

    ", we estimate that starburst contamination in the observed [ o iv ] 26 @xmath6 m luminosity is very small , @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the fractional agn contribution to the total bolometric luminosity ( see below ) .",
    "the flux ratio between [ ne v ] 14.3 @xmath6 m and [ o iv ] 26 @xmath6 m lines also supports that the [ o iv ] luminosity is dominated by the agn component ( @xcite ) . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the data of other ulirgs , iras 051892524 , iras 131205453 , and mrk 273 , taken from the sample observed by @xcite by excluding superantenna ( iras f192547245 ) , a candidate of a heavily compton thick agn ( @xmath156 @xmath1 ) , and mrk 231 , a probable outlier object ( broad absorption line qso ) .",
    "the curves represent the expected relations for seyfert 1 ( solid ) and compton - thin seyfert 2 galaxies ( dashed ) based on the average l@xmath157/l@xmath158}$ ] ratio obtained by @xcite with the 210 kev to bolometric luminosity conversion factor given by @xcite .",
    "as noticed from figure  [ oiv ] , the [ o iv ] to x - ray luminosity ratio in ugc 5101 is similar to those of normal seyfert galaxies .",
    "this is also the case for the two ulirgs except mrk 273 , demonstrating that a significant portion of ulirgs in the current _ nustar _  sample are not really `` x - ray faint '' with respect to the [ o iv ] 26 @xmath6 m flux . since the luminosity of [ o iv ] 26 @xmath6 m is determined by that of ionizing uv photons leaked to the nlr out of surrounding matter , it should be roughly proportional to the product of ( 1 @xmath159 covering fraction ) and the intrinsic agn luminosity in the uv band .",
    "thus , there could be two explanations for this observational fact .",
    "the first one is that the agn in ugc 5101 is not different from those in normal seyfert galaxies in terms of the covering fraction of surrounding matter and uv to x - ray spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the second one is that , in ugc 5101 , _ both _ [ o iv ] 26 @xmath6 m and x - ray luminosities are smaller with respect to the bolometric agn luminosity than in normal seyfert galaxies .",
    "we find difficulties in the first explanation , however .",
    "the agn bolometric luminosity converted from the 210 kev luminosity with the @xcite relation ( i.e. , that for normal agns ) turns out to be @xmath160 erg s@xmath4 ( with a bolometric correction factor of 19 ) , corresponding to only @xmath57% of the total bolometric luminosity . this fraction is smaller than those estimated from the _ spitzer _ spectra with diagnostics not using the nlr lines , @xmath16152%80% @xcite ( see their table  7 ) or @xmath16114%55% @xcite ( see their table  12 ) .",
    "this implies that the sed of the agn in ugc 5101 is x - ray under - luminous relative to the uv luminosity , which dominates the bolometric one , as compared with normal agns .",
    "also , as mentioned in section  1 , the [ o iv ] 26 @xmath6 m luminosity seems to underestimate the true bolometric agn luminosity , implying that the total covering fraction of compton - thick and compton - thin matter is larger than those of normal agns .",
    "we therefore consider that the second explanation would be a likely scenario for ugc 5101 .",
    "our picture , illustrated in figure  [ torus ] , is summarized as follows , even though there are large uncertainties ( by a factor of a few ) in the numbers .",
    "the surrounding structure consists of two parts , a compton - thick part ( @xmath162 @xmath1 ) located close to the equatorial plane and a compton - thin part ( @xmath163 @xmath1 ) in the torus hole region , although they may not be discrete in reality .",
    "the covering fraction of compton - thick matter is small , which is derived from the hard x - ray spectra .",
    "the _ total _ covering fraction of compton - thick and compton - thin matter that blocks uv lights is large , which accounts for the low [ o iv ] 26 @xmath6 m luminosity relative to the agn bolometric luminosity .",
    "the intrinsic bolometric luminosity of the agn is truly @xmath164 erg s@xmath4 , corresponding to @xmath2650% of the total luminosity , as inferred from the ir spectra . because the intrinsic agn luminosity in the 210 kev band we determine is @xmath165 erg s@xmath4 , the 210 kev to bolometric luminosity correction factor of this agn is estimated to be @xmath166140 .",
    "this value is relatively large ( i.e. , the uv to x - ray sed is steep ) compared with those of typical seyferts with similar x - ray luminosities @xcite , but can be expected at high eddington rates @xcite i.e. , in rapidly growing smbhs .",
    "thus , because both the [ o iv ] 26 @xmath6 m and x - ray luminosities are suppressed , their ratio remains almost the same as those of normal seyferts .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that agns in many ulirgs do not look extraordinary ( i.e. , extremely x - ray faint ) , as suggested by recent works ( e.g. , @xcite ) , compared with normal seyferts . since the strong starburst activity in the nuclear region may increase both the total covering fraction of surrounding matter and the mass accretion rate , it may not be a coincidence that a ulirg shows a standard value of the [ o iv ] 26 @xmath6 m to x - ray luminosity ratio .    to summarize",
    ", we have revealed the complex structure of the circumnuclear region of ugc 5101 ; in short , the covering fraction of the compton - thick torus is small , while the total covering fraction of compton - thick and compton - thin matter is large , making the nucleus `` unburied '' in x - rays but `` buried '' in uv .",
    "this implies that , in a more realistic geometry , there is a strong contrast in the column - density distribution as a function of inclination angle , that is , matter is highly concentrated toward the equatorial plane .",
    "we point out that the nearby compton - thick agn ngc 4945 may have a similar circumnuclear structure to that of ugc 5101 . in ngc 4945",
    ", x - ray spectral and variability properties suggest a small covering fraction of the compton - thick torus ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , whereas , from observations of nlr lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is inferred that the agn is surrounded by matter with a large covering fraction . to answer the question",
    "if this is a general property of obscuring material in compton thick agns , it is important to perform sensitive broadband x - ray observations for a larger sample of heavily obscured agns .",
    "using all available data taken with _ swift _ , _ nustar _ , _ suzaku _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _",
    ", we have presented the best quality broadband x - ray spectra of ugc 5101 covering the 0.25100 kev band .",
    "the spectra are well reproduced by conventional analytic models or a numerical torus model for an obscured agn .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized below .    * we detect a compton - thick agn with a line - of - sight column density of @xmath167 @xmath1 .",
    "the intrinsic 210 kev luminosity is determined to be @xmath168 erg s@xmath4 , which is @xmath52.5 times larger than the previous estimate using only data below 10 kev . * a weak absorption of @xmath151 @xmath1 to the soft x - ray",
    "scattered component is required . *",
    "a spectral fit with a smooth torus model favors a large ( @xmath2 degrees ) half opening angle of the torus .",

    "thus , a significant portion of ulirgs are not really `` x - ray faint '' with respect to the [ o iv ] 26 @xmath6 m flux .",
    "* to reconcile these results with the large agn contribution ( @xmath2650% ) to the total bolometric luminosity inferred by the ir spectra , a possible scenario is that ( 1 ) the agn in ugc 5101 is surrounded not only by compton - thick matter located close to the equatorial plane but also by compton - thin matter with @xmath151 @xmath1 in the torus - hole region , and ( 2 ) it has a steep uv to x - ray sed , which is expected at a high eddington rate .",
