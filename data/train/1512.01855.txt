    "fragmentation functions @xmath2 , describe the probability for a parton @xmath3 at the factorization scale @xmath4 to fragment into a hadron @xmath5 carrying away a fraction @xmath6 of its momentum .",
    "they are key quantities for calculating hadroproduction cross sections . in this respect",
    ", one needs to determine these functions with high accuracy .",
    "recently , in @xcite pion fragmentation functions ( ffs ) are studied at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) using data from @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "+ the specific importance of ffs is due to their model - independent predictions of cross sections at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "specially , to study the properties of top quarks at the lhc , one of the proposed channels is to consider the energy spectrum of outgoing hadrons _",
    "h _ from top decays in the process @xmath7 . for this purpose ,",
    "having parton - level differential decay rates for the subprocess @xmath8 at nlo @xcite and ffs of partons into hadrons @xmath9 ( _ i = b , g _ ) , one can calculate the energy distribution of observed hadrons .",
    "for example , the cms collaboration reconstructs the top mass from the peak of the energy distribution of bottom - flavored hadrons @xcite .",
    "since the hadronization mechanism is universal and independent of the perturbative processes which produce the partons one can exploit , for example , the existing data on @xmath10 events to fit the proposed models for the ffs describing @xmath11 , and use them to make predictions for other processes , such as top decays @xmath12 .",
    "ffs are also useful for theoretical calculations of inclusive hadron production at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and for investigating the origin of the proton spin .",
    "generally , there are two main approaches to evaluate the ffs .",
    "the first approach is based on the fact that the ffs for hadrons containing a heavy quark or antiquark can be computed theoretically using perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) @xcite . the first theoretical attempt to explain the procedure of hadron production from a heavy quark",
    "was made by bjorken @xcite by using a naive quark - parton model .",
    "he deduced that the inclusive distribution of heavy hadrons should peak almost at @xmath13 , where @xmath14 refers to the scaled - energy variable of hadrons .",
    "the pqcd framework was applied by peterson @xcite , suzuki @xcite , amiri and ji @xcite , while in this framework suzuki calculates the heavy ffs by using a convenient feynman diagram and considering a typical wave function for the hadronic bound states .",
    "one of us , using suzuki s approach , has calculated the ffs for a charm quark to split into s - wave @xmath15 mesons @xcite and for a gluon to split into s - wave charmonium states ( @xmath16 ) @xcite at leading order in the qcd coupling constant @xmath17 .",
    "+ in the second approach which is frequently used to obtain the ffs , these functions are parametrized in a specific model and extracted from experimental data analysis using the data from @xmath0 reactions , lepton - hadron and hadron - hadron scattering processes .",
    "this situation is very similar to the determination of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs)@xcite . among all scattering processes , the best processes which provide a clean environment to determine the ffs are @xmath0 annihilation processes .",
    "however , without an initial hadron state one can not separate quark distributions from antiquark distributions .",
    "there are several theoretical studies on qcd analysis of ffs which used special parameterizations and different experimental data in their global analysis .",
    "recent extracted ffs for light hadrons are related to akk @xcite , skma @xcite , lss @xcite , dsehs @xcite , dss @xcite and hkns @xcite collaborations who used different phenomenological models and varying experimental data . in @xcite , we determined the @xmath18 and @xmath19 ffs , both at leading order ( lo ) and nlo through a global fit to the single - inclusive @xmath0 annihilation ( sia ) data and the semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) asymmetry data from hermes and compass .",
    "there , we broke the symmetry assumption between the quark and antiquark ffs for favored partons by using the asymmetry data .",
    "+ in this paper , we present a new functional form of proton ffs up to nlo , obtained through a global fit to sia data from lep ( aleph and delphi collaborations ) , slac ( sld and tpc collaborations ) and desy ( tasso collaboration ) @xcite .",
    "we also impose the effects of the proton mass on the ffs , a topic with very little attention paid to in the literatures , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we show that this effect is important in calculating gluon and light quark ffs , specifically at low energies .",
    "this effect reduces the minimized @xmath1 and makes a more convenient fit .    in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics",
    "the top quark has a short lifetime ( @xmath20 @xcite ) , so it decays before hadronization takes place .",
    "therefore its full polarization content is retained when it decays .",
    "as was mentioned , one way to study its properties is to consider the energy distributions of the produced hadrons in top decays . here",
    ", we also make predictions for the scaled - energy distribution of protons inclusively produced in top quark decays , @xmath21 , using the extracted ffs at our analysis and the parton - level wilson coefficients calculated in @xcite .",
    "these predictions will also enable us to deepen our understanding of the nonperturbative aspects of proton formation by hadronization and to pin down the proton ffs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe the formalism and our parametrization of proton fragmentation functions at lo and nlo . using the sia data we present our fit results and shall compare our results against ffs from other well - known collaborations .",
    "we also describe the gaussian method to calculate errors in our analysis . in section  [ sec3 ] , we explain how to impose the effect of the hadron mass on the ffs and compare our results in both cases . our predictions for the energy spectrum of protons produced in unpolarized top quark decays are presented in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "our results are summarized in section  [ sec5 ] .",

    "in this section , we apply the massive proton ffs to make phenomenological predictions for the energy spectrum of protons produced in unpolarized top decays @xmath25 where @xmath26 stands for the unobserved final state .",
    "both the @xmath27-quark and the gluon may hadronize into the produced protons , while the gluon contributes to the real radiation at nlo .",
    "+ generally , to obtain the energy distribution of the produced hadron @xmath28 , we employ the factorization theorem ( [ moadele ] ) , which is now expressed as @xmath29 where , as in @xcite , we defined the scaled - energy fraction of the hadron as @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the parton - level differential decay rates of the process @xmath32 .",
    "the nlo analytical expressions for the parton - level differential decay widths @xmath33 are presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . in @xcite , we studied the effects of parton and hadron masses on the hadron energy spectrum produced through top decays .",
    "+ in ( [ eq : master ] ) , the factorization and the renormalization scales are set to @xmath34 gev and we also set @xmath35 gev , @xmath36 mev and @xmath37 gev .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , to show our prediction for the energy spectrum of produced protons we study the size of the nlo corrections , by showing the total result ( solid line ) , and comparing the relative importance of the @xmath38 ( dashed line ) and @xmath39 ( dot - dashed line ) fragmentation channels .",
    "as is seen , the gluon contribution ( dot - dashed line ) is negative and appreciable only in the low @xmath40 region . for higher values of @xmath41",
    "the nlo result is practically exhausted by the @xmath38 contribution , as expected @xcite .",
    "note that the contribution of the gluon ff can not be discriminated .",
    "it is calculated to see where it contributes to @xmath42 .",
    "so , this part of the plot is of more theoretical relevance . in the scaled - energy of hadrons , as an experimental quantity , all contributions including the b - quark and gluon contribute . in fig .",

    "[ pffsq29 ] and [ pffsq34 ] , it is seen that our results for the b - quark fragmentation function are in good consistency with the results extracted by the akk for the values higher than @xmath44 , then one expects to have the same results for the @xmath42 in both analysis .     @xmath45 as a function of @xmath40 ( solid line ) at @xmath46 .",
    "the nlo result is broken up into the contributions due to @xmath38 ( dashed line ) and @xmath39 ( dot - dashed line ) fragmentations . ]",
    "result for the partial decay rate @xmath42 is shown using the extracted @xmath47 ffs in the presence of the proton mass .",
    "we also show the same distribution using the ffs presented by akk @xcite . ]",
    "we determined new nonperturbative fragmentation functions for the proton in the parton model of qcd through a global analysis on sia data at the lo and nlo approximations .",
    "our new parametrization of the proton ffs covers a wide kinematic range of @xmath14 , in the presence of the extra term @xmath48 which controls the medium-@xmath14 region and improves the accuracy of the global fit .",
    "[ xsec3 ] represents the comparison of our model with sia experimental data and shows that our model is successful .",
    "we determined the ffs of gluon and light quarks at the initial scale @xmath49 gev@xmath50 and the ffs of heavy quarks at @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "their evaluation was performed by using the dglap equations .",
    "our analysis was based on the zm - vfn scheme , where all partons are treated as massless particles and the nonzero values of the c- and b - quark masses only enter through the initial conditions of the ffs . comparing to other collaborations",
    "we also considered the effects of the proton mass on the ffs and showed that this effect improves the accuracy of the global fit , specifically for the data from slac ( tpc collaborations ) and desy ( tasso collaboration ) .",
    "the proton mass affects the light and gluon ffs while for the heavy quark ffs this effect is less important .",
    "the advent of precise data from lhc offers us the opportunity to further constrain the proton ffs and to test their scaling violations .",
    "this situation motivates the incorporation of proton mass effects into the formalism , which are then likely to be no longer negligible .",
    "the mass of the proton also sets a bound on the scaling variable @xmath53 .",
    "+ finally , as an application , we used the computed ffs to study the scaled - energy distribution of protons in unpolarized top quark decays . at lhc ,",
    "the scaled - energy distribution of hadrons in top decays enables us to deepen our knowledge of the hadronization process .",
    "the universality and scaling violations of the proton ffs will be able to be tested at the lhc by comparing our nlo predictions with future measurements of @xmath42 .",
    "besides nlo corrections , some other corrections can improve our analysis .",
    "in future work , we plan to extend the method developed in @xcite in the framework of @xmath0 annihilation to resum large logarithmic terms , due to soft - gluon radiation , to all perturbative orders in the qcd coupling @xmath17 .",
