    "recent x - ray observations of the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) filling galaxy groups and clusters have indicated problems with both the levels of the density , @xmath0 @xmath1 , and the distribution of the temperature @xmath2 , with average values @xmath3 kev from very rich clusters to poor groups .",
    "first , the lower densities found in poor clusters and groups imply mass ratios @xmath4 of icm to dark matter ( dm ) considerably below the cosmic baryonic fraction approached in rich clusters ( see sanderson & ponman 2003 , pratt & arnaud 2003 ) .",
    "second , radial profiles @xmath5 have been measured , if coarsely , in several nearby clusters ; they show a roughly isothermal plateau extending out to substantial radii @xmath6 in terms of the virial radius @xmath7 , and then a decline by a factor @xmath8 out to @xmath9 ( markevitch et al .",
    "1998 , de grandi & molendi 2002 , vikhlinin et al . 2005 ) .",
    "although still debated in detail , this behavior differs from the predictions of simple modeling in terms of a polytropic equation of state @xmath10 with constant index @xmath11 .",
    "it also differs at @xmath12 from the outcomes of most state - of - the - art numerical simulations , where @xmath5 keeps rising toward the cluster center to @xmath13 as discussed , e.g. , by borgani et al .",
    "a central , limited dip of @xmath5 observed in many clusters ( e.g. , piffaretti et al . 2005 ) and often referred to as a `` cool core '' ( molendi & pizzolato 2001 ) is arguably attributed to a quenched `` cooling flow '' ( see the discussion by fabian 2004 ) . such dips involve icm fractions of some @xmath14 and constitute a specific issue not of direct concern here .    to focus the problems in the _ bulk _ of the icm , temperature and density",
    "are conveniently combined into a significant single quantity , the specific entropy @xmath15 ; here we adopt the widely used adiabat @xmath16 , which is related to @xmath15 by @xmath17 ( bower 1997 ; balogh , babul & patton 1999 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 constitutes the simplest combination of @xmath19 and @xmath2 that is invariant under adiabatic processes in the icm ; nonadiabatic processes compete to produce different levels and profiles of @xmath18 , that cooling always lowers and various heating processes tend to raise",
    ".    when the data on @xmath19 and @xmath2 are combined to yield @xmath18 , it is found that ( i ) in moving from clusters to groups the _ levels _ of @xmath18 decline only slowly ( in fact , like @xmath20 ) taking on values from around @xmath21 to some @xmath22 kev @xmath23 ; ( ii ) in clusters the entropy _ profiles _ @xmath24 have to be described in terms of a running index @xmath25 that implies profiles @xmath24 flattening inwards .",
    "these findings may be unified under the heading of an entropy `` _ _ excess _ _ '' in the icm .",
    "the baseline is provided by gravitational heating , the basic process that affects the thermal state of the icm during its inflow into the structures as they are built up by standard hierarchical clustering ( peebles 1993 ) . during the buildup ,",
    "the dm component sets the gravitational potential wells into which the baryons fall , starting with the cosmic density ratio close to @xmath26 ( bennett at al .",
    "2003 ) . if the baryons start cold , they fall in supersonically , and are shock - heated to temperatures @xmath2 close to the virial value @xmath27 ( cavaliere , menci & tozzi 1999 ; tozzi & norman 2001 ; voit et al .",
    "however , such a process produces ( see ponman , sanderson , & finoguenov 2003 ) : ( i ) entropy levels lower than observed in groups and poor clusters ; ( ii ) entropy profiles in rich clusters that decline too steeply inwards , in fact , as @xmath28 .",
    "such drawbacks have raised a wide debate concerning the nature of the additional processes that increase the entropy of the icm ; suggestions include the following possibilities .",
    "energy drain by radiative cooling extended well beyond the very central cool core may cause much of the cold gas to condense into stars , leaving a residual diffuse component with higher entropy ( voit & bryan 2001 ) ; however , such a cooling alone would produce too much cold gas and too many stars ( e.g. , mccarthy et al .",
    "repeated energy inputs by supernovae and active galactic nuclei preheat the gas external to forming groups or clusters , raise its state to a higher adiabat , and are expected to hinder its inflow under any model ( evrard & henry 1991 ; kaiser 1991 ) ; specifically , as the inflow becomes less supersonic , the shocks are weakened while additional entropy is carried in ( valageas & silk 1999 ; wu , fabian & nulsen 2000 ; cavaliere , lapi & menci 2002a ) .",
    "energy impulsively discharged by powerful quasars into their ambient medium propagates outwards beyond the host galaxy into a surrounding group ( mazzotta et al .",
    "2004a ; mcnamara et al .",
    "2005 ) ; the propagation may occur in the form of outgoing , moderately supersonic blast waves which at the leading shocks raise the entropy in the gas they sweep up ( lapi , cavaliere & menci 2005 ) .",
    "finally , in rich clusters thermal or turbulent diffusion may be effective in depositing and/or smearing out entropy inward of @xmath29 ( narayan & medvedev 2001 ; kim & narayan 2003 ; lapi & cavaliere , in preparation ) .",
    "pinning down the leading process clearly requires precise measurements of the levels and profiles of the all - important adiabat @xmath18 .",
    "the state variables @xmath19 and @xmath2 that determine @xmath18 may be measured with x - ray observations ( see sarazin 1988 ) .",
    "the bolometric bremsstrahlung emissions @xmath30 erg s@xmath31 primarily provides @xmath19 , while spatially resolved spectroscopy ( continuum plus emission lines ) can yield the temperatures @xmath2 when enough photons are collected .    on the other hand",
    ", the hot icm electrons inverse - compton scatter the cmb photons crossing a cluster ; this sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sz , sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 ) constitutes a major icm ( and cosmological ) probe in the @xmath32wave and submm bands , as reviewed by rephaeli ( 1995 ) , birkinshaw ( 1999 ) , and carlstrom , holder & reese ( 2002 ) .",
    "the intensity of the thermal sz effect is given by the comptonization parameter @xmath33 , which constitutes a good measure of the electron pressure @xmath34 in the icm ; so far it has been observed in many rich clusters at the expected levels @xmath35 ( zhang & wu 2000 ; grainge et al .",
    "2002 ; reese et al . 2002 ; benson et al .",
    "the main dependencies of @xmath36 and @xmath37 strongly motivate us to employ the results of x - ray and sz observations combined as to provide the adiabat in the form @xmath38 , in order to better probe properties of , and processes in the icm .",
    "the levels @xmath39 of the entropy ( usually sampled at @xmath40 , see ponman et al .",
    "2003 ) and of the x - ray luminosity @xmath41 ( dominated by the inner icm anyway ) are linked by the relation @xmath42 derived in appendix a. in moving from clusters to groups , this highlights the deviations from the quantities @xmath43 and @xmath44 that provide the baseline scaling  including the hubble parameter @xmath45  set by the pure gravitational heating ( see   1 ) ; the latter implies @xmath46 , and baryon densities simply proportional to those of the dm ( kaiser 1986 ) .",
    "( 2 ) has been first proposed by cavaliere , lapi & menci ( 2002b ) ; similar expressions have been subsequently used by dos santos & dor ( 2002 ) , and mccarthy et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , in the context of specific models for entropy enhancement . here",
    "we stress the _ model - independent _ nature of eq .",
    "( 2 ) ; the latter holds whenever the icm fills in a statistical , virial - type equilibrium a dm potential well , and depends weakly on specific dm distributions or specific equations of state for the icm .",
    "this is demonstrated in appendix a and table  a1 , where we show that from clusters to groups the prefactor on the r.h.s .",
    "( 2 ) depends weakly on @xmath2 , so as to closely preserve the above scaling .",
    "we illustrate the role that eq .",
    "( 2 ) may play in probing the processes that set the icm thermal state .",
    "we first recall that in poor clusters and groups with @xmath47 ranging from about @xmath48 to about @xmath8 kev the observed values of @xmath41 are found to be progressively lower than @xmath49 by factors from @xmath50 to @xmath14 , with a steep decline close to @xmath51 ( osmond & ponman 2004 ) . in other words , moving toward smaller and cooler structures the icm is found to be progressively underluminous , hence _",
    "underdense _ relative to the gravitational values .",
    "the outcome is even more surprising on two accounts : smaller structures ought to have condensed earlier from a denser universe ; moreover , emission lines from highly excited metals add to the bremsstrahlung continuum to yield a flatter gravitational scaling @xmath52 for @xmath53 kev ( see appendix a ) . according to eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the systematically _ lower _ values of @xmath54 will correspond to _ higher _ entropy levels , exceeding @xmath55 by factors up to @xmath56 . in detail",
    ", the steep relation @xmath57 will reflect into a flat behavior @xmath58 , which indeed agrees with recent data analyses ( see ponman et al .",
    "2003 ) .    on the other hand , a number of authors ( e.g. , mahdavi et al .",
    "1997 ; roussel , sadat & blanchard 2000 ) have questioned the significance of the data concerning groups , given various observational and systematic uncertainties related to the limited statistics and to the necessary subtraction of considerable contributions from single galaxies .",
    "recent critical assessments of the data ( mushotzky 2004 ; osmond & ponman 2004 ) acknowledge the relevance of these problems in individual groups , but confirm the general trend toward lower densities in poorer systems , albeit with a wide scatter .    to cross - check these low x - ray luminosities @xmath41 , one may preliminarily use the sz effect ; in fact , these two independent probes of the icm density are expected to correlate according to @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the comptonization parameter integrated along a `` central '' line of sight ( l.o.s . ) , and @xmath61 gives its gravitational scaling after cole & kaiser ( 1988 ) ; see appendix a for the derivation and added detail , including a discussion of the contributions to @xmath60 from the outer icm . when @xmath62 applies , eq .",
    "( 3 ) predicts the scaling @xmath63 to hold in equilibrium conditions ( cavaliere & menci 2001 ) .",
    "such systematically lower values of @xmath64 may be tested or bounded with high - sensitivity sz observations of poor clusters and groups , as initiated by benson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "then one can proceed to directly obtain the entropy levels from the equilibrium relations eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "upcoming sz measurements will provide high - sensitivity data , which will be conveniently joined with x - ray fluxes to obtain entropy levels that scale as @xmath65 in equilibrium conditions but otherwise in a model - independent way . in moving to groups where line emission is important , eq .",
    "( 4 ) goes over to @xmath66 ; appendix a gives the details , including the slow dependence on @xmath2 of the prefactor .",
    "note that the present approach bypasses two difficulties ( discussed , e.g. , by mazzotta et al .",
    "2004b ) in deriving the icm temperatures from spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopy : ( i ) the latter requires more photons than imaging , so with comparable observation times and efficiencies , precise @xmath2 are obtained at smaller radii than @xmath19 ; ii ) in a multiphase medium spectroscopic determinations of @xmath2 are biased toward the colder regions .",
    "the integrated sz flux @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the angular diameter distance , may be used instead of the central parameter @xmath60 ; in terms of @xmath69 , eq .",
    "( 4 ) may be recast as @xmath70 using this relation has two advantages over eq .",
    "( 4 ) . not only is @xmath69 a more robust observable in clusters with a cool core ( e.g. , benson et al .",
    "2004 ) , but also @xmath71 has the same @xmath72 dependence as @xmath41 .",
    "so the combination is largely free of the size effects due to the scaling @xmath73 for coeval structures ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ a2 ] )",
    "; it rather highlights the dependence on the baryonic fraction .",
    "so far we have dealt with the overall entropy _",
    "levels _ determined from the integrated x - ray and sz observables . but the entropy _",
    "profiles _ of individual clusters carry additional information ; clearly this will be difficult to extract from the prefactors in global relations like eqs .",
    "( 2)-(5 ) , encased as it is under integrated forms within ratios or products of shape factors , as made explicit in appendix a.",
    "to go beyond the above global scaling laws , spatially resolved x - ray and sz observations are clearly required . in x rays , _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ are already providing data at a few arcsec resolutions ; but obtaining both the good spatial and _ spectral _ resolution needed to measure @xmath5 and derive @xmath24 still presents a challenge , especially in the outer icm of distant clusters .",
    "improvements will again be provided by joining measurements of x - ray brightness and of sz effect with comparable levels of spatial resolutions .",
    "in fact , the prospective good resolution and high sensitivity ( added to multi - frequency capabilities ) of the many upcoming sz experiments ( for a recent review , see birkinshaw 2004 ) stimulate renewed impetus for considering the deprojected quantities that have been discussed from time to time ( e.g. , silk & white 1978 , cavaliere 1980 ) .    here",
    "our specific proposal is to use joint x - ray and sz measurements to derive directly from the data the radial entropy profiles @xmath24 in the icm .",
    "we will work in terms of the x - ray surface brightness and of sz intensity distributions , integrated along a l.o.s at a projected distance @xmath74 from the cluster center .",
    "for spherically averaged icm distributions these observables are related to the corresponding volume quantities by @xmath75 where the constants are defined after eq .",
    "note how strongly the x - ray surface brightness decreases as the redshift @xmath76 increases , while the sz effect is @xmath76-independent , apart from the dilution effect related to the size of the instrumental beam .    to construct the adiabat @xmath77 we need to retrieve the volume quantities @xmath78 and @xmath5 from the projected quantities @xmath79 and @xmath80 given by eqs .",
    "( 6 ) . actually , the latter are in the form of two abel integral equations , which may be solved for the volume quantities along the lines recalled in appendix b ; the results come to @xmath81 we stress that the two volume quantities @xmath82 and @xmath83 are defined directly in terms of the observed surface or l.o.s .",
    "observables @xmath84 or @xmath80 .",
    "( 7 ) are easily combined ( over the spatial range common to both data sets ) to yield the entropy profile in the simple , _ model - independent _ form @xmath85 so far we have not assumed any specific equation of state for the icm , rather we derive it from @xmath24 above ; in particular , the local polytropic index defined in eq .",
    "( 1 ) reads @xmath86^{-1}~.\\ ] ]    to illustrate the importance of the profile @xmath24 we contrast two physical conditions . on the one hand ,",
    "a reference baseline is provided once again by the gravitational heating associated with smooth accretion of successive shells ( involving dm plus gas , as started by bertschinger 1985 ) during the hierarchical buildup of a rich cluster . this `` surface '' process taking place at the outskirts of the growing structure yields @xmath28 and @xmath87 in the region @xmath29 ( tozzi & norman 2001 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the actual inflow is likely to include additional `` volume '' processes induced by infall and sinking of lumps , the well - known merging component in the process of structure formation ( see norman 2005 ) .",
    "these dynamical events can drive subsonic turbulent diffusion and related entropy transport from the outskirts toward the inner regions ( see goldman & rephaeli 1991 ; ricker & sarazin 2001 ; inogamov & sunyaev 2003 ) ; clearly these processes will enforce entropy profiles flatter than @xmath88 , a matter expanded upon elsewhere ( lapi & cavaliere , in preparation ) .",
    "so it is seen that the entropy profiles can help unveiling the actual physical conditions in clusters .",
    "note that eqs .",
    "( 7 ) also yield the density and temperature profiles in the form @xmath89 correspondingly , the local cooling timescale for bremsstrahlung emission reads @xmath90 comparing this to the hubble time provides a criterion to avoid the inclusion of a region like a cool core , where the physical conditions are very different from the rest of the cluster .",
    "so far , our derivations have been free of specific assumptions concerning models for the dm gravitational potentials , or hydrostatic equilibrium , or equation of state .",
    "assuming now detailed hydrostatic equilibrium , one can use the icm quantities to trace the dm mass distribution ( e.g. , bahcall & sarazin 1977 ; fabricant & gorenstein 1983 ) , and obtain the result @xmath91 here @xmath92 is the mean molecular weight for a plasma of one - third solar metallicity , @xmath93 is the proton mass and @xmath94 is the gravitational constant .",
    "equivalently , eq .  ( 12 ) may be used to derive a model for the dm gravitational potential , to be compared with specific forms such as king s ( 1972 ) and nfw ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) , or with the data obtained from gravitational lensing ( e.g. , lombardi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "given that the imaging capabilities of the present x - ray instruments ( _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ) have attained resolutions down to about @xmath95 and fractional sensitivities of order @xmath14 or better , what can be learned right now by joining these x - ray data with the current , considerably coarser sz observations ?",
    "in fact , here problems arise even for the global scaling laws , and more for profile reconstructions . as discussed in detail by diaferio et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , considerable discrepancies as to the scaling laws are found among current sz samples produced with different instruments , even when the samples have many sources in common . on the other hand , to effectively constrain a fit to the observed sz distributions often it has been found necessary to use also x - ray information ( see reese et al .",
    "2003 , benson et al .",
    "2004 ) ; this breaks the independence of these two observables that is important for deriving @xmath24 .",
    "a step forward has recently been taken by the observations of the x - ray cluster rx j1347 - 1145 with the nobeyama telescope ( komatsu et al .",
    "2001 ) ; the good resolution of order @xmath96 obtained in these measurements enabled deriving a truly independent sz profile . in analyzing these data kitayama et al .",
    "( 2004 ) excise the most asymmetric sector , and spherically average the rest to deconvolve the temperature profile , finding results consistent with - but still no better than - the x - ray spectroscopy .    in the light of upcoming sz capabilities of sub - arcmin resolution and sensitivities",
    "better than @xmath97k , we consider next the prospects from measurements with instruments or experiments such as sza ( holder et al .",
    "2000 ) , ami ( jones 2002 ) , amiba ( lo 2002 ) , mito ( lamagna et al . 2005 ) , olimpo ( masi et al . 2003 ) , act ( kosowsky 2003 ) , spt ( carlstrom et al .",

    "preselected areas , resolutions down to a few arcsecs will be eventually provided by alma ( see http:// www.alma.nrao.edu/[http:// www.alma.nrao.edu/ ] ) , at frequencies on both sides of @xmath99 ghz , the crossover point where the thermal sz effect goes from negative to positive .",
    "we build mock renditions of the prospective observations as described next .",
    "we make use of two _ independent _ , flexible parameterizations for the spatial distributions of the x - ray brightness and sz effect ; both are of the form @xmath100^{-b}~\\ ] ] often adopted for either one , though best suited to clusters with no cool core . here",

    "following yoshikawa & suto ( 1999 ; see also tsutsumi et al .",

    "it is seen that the average reconstructed profiles are quite similar to the input profiles over a considerable range , in spite of uncertainties and of some systematic deviations increasingly induced at small and large radii by our emulated resolution and sensitivity .",

    "we will see below that all factors : @xmath168 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath167 , vary only weakly from clusters to groups , and so constitute minor corrections to the explicit scaling laws above .",
    "this stems from the circumstance that the structural function @xmath169 entering the shape factors depends weakly on @xmath145 from clusters to groups , as observed by sanderson & ponman ( 2003 ) and pratt & arnaud ( 2003 ) .",
    "weak dependence of @xmath78 is also expected from all equilibrium models ( as discussed in depth by cavaliere et al .",
    "2002b ) ; in fact , these show a weaker and weaker dependence in passing from king ( 1972 ) to nfw gravitational potentials ( due to their dm concentration rising from clusters to groups , see navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ) , or from isothermal to polytropic icm ( due to a lesser density rise toward the center ) .    on eliminating @xmath144 from eqs .",

    "then the temperature run writes @xmath186 , in terms of the potential difference @xmath187/\\sigma^2 $ ] normalized to the dm one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath188 . as to the dm potential @xmath189",
