    "photoassociation ( pa ) experiments in which two interacting ultracold atoms ( usually ground state alkali atoms or metastable rare gas atoms ) are resonantly excited by a laser to a molecular bound state provide a powerful technique to study the dynamics of ultracold collisions @xcite .",
    "since the colliding atoms are so cold , the energy of the initial scattering state is well determined and the resonant laser energies corresponding to transitions to various bound states produce a very high resolution spectrum ( @xmath6 mhz ) . at this level of precision , energy level shifts induced by the pa laser",
    "can be significant @xcite and an understanding of the dependence of the energy level shifts upon the laser intensity , polarization and frequency is crucial .",
    "the short lived bound states created in photoassociation are unique in that they can occupy both the small interatomic regions of conventional molecules and the unusual large interatomic regions of hundreds of bohr radii depending upon the particular intermolecular potential . for purely long range molecules",
    ", the interaction between the atoms , and hence the molecular potentials , arises from dispersion forces that depend mainly upon well known atomic parameters .",
    "extensions of the photoassociation technique can be used to determine the lifetimes of excited states @xcite , scattering lengths of ground states @xcite , create ground state cold molecules @xcite and drive other laser orientated processes .",
    "although ultracold physics and the achievement of bose - einstein condensation has its roots in alkali species , the cooling of excited state species such as metastable helium opens many more opportunities for experiment .",
    "metastable rare gas atoms offer exciting experimental detection strategies to study quantum gases as their large internal energy can be released through penning and associative ionization during interatomic collisions and through ejection of electrons when the atoms strike a metal surface .",
    "additionally , trap purity is more easily maintained in a metastable gas , as rare gas ground states are not trapped by the same mechanisms as metastable states .",
    "the metastable atoms are generally spin - polarized in order to suppress the autoionization rate and to thereby attain large numbers of trapped atoms . as well , no hyperfine structure is present in rare gas species , making them more desirable to investigate than many other species .    in metastable helium a number of experimental investigations have been conducted using photoassociation as the diagnostic tool .",

    "it is difficult to relate this behavior to the collision process without the appropriate association of the dressed state description with the experimental , undressed states .",
    "when the laser is switched on , the initial undressed states must be transformed to the dressed states and in this process the undressed open channels acquire significant components of the pseudo - open and closed dressed channels and thereby suffer loss . in the limit of infinite intensity , the open dressed channels become completely uncoupled from the pseudo - open and closed channels , and the loss from the dressed states is entirely due to the activation of the laser .",
    "this suggests that the general interpretation of quantities constructed from dressed s - matrix elements at large intensities requires a proper description of the activation of the laser in the formalism .",

    "the small differences can be explained by the fact that a finite kinetic energy ( 2.1 @xmath330 ) was used in the close - coupled calculation whereas a zero kinetic energy was used in the perturbative calculation .",
    "we note that an increase in the kinetic energy by an order of magnitude decreases the non - perturbative line shift fit parameter by approximately 2% .    at higher intensities",
    "the perturbative results remain a fair approximation to the non - perturbative results , however small non - linear differences are evident , affecting the line shifts by up to 5% .",
    "additionally , a maximum intensity is found that limits the visibility of the resonances .",
    "this laser saturation should be observable in the laboratory and suggests that ultracold photoassociation to shallow potentials is only useful at lower laser intensities . although not reported here , it can be shown @xcite that the perturbative line width is also linearly dependent upon laser intensity .",
    "this is obviously not true in the present non - perturbative calculation , where a significant quadratic behavior is observed .",
