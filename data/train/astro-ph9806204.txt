    "<S> 46 lines have been detected in the spectrum of object a while 36 in the spectrum of object b , of them 29 and 20 were identified as ly@xmath0absorptions respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the present observations have been supplemented with data of comparable quality on other 7 qso pairs available in the literature to give an enlarged sample of 217 ly@xmath0  lines with rest equivalent width @xmath1  . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the hits ( i.e. when an absorption line appears in both qso spectra ) and misses ( i.e. when a line is seen in any of the qso spectra , but no line is seen in the other ) , carried out with an improved statistical approach , indicates that the absorbers have typically a large size km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 ) , @xmath3 . ] : @xmath4 kpc , with 95% confidence limits @xmath5 kpc and @xmath6 kpc , with 95% confidence limits @xmath7 kpc for the radius of idealized spherical and disc geometries , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the present data do not allow to establish any correlation of the typical inferred size with the proper separation or with the redshift of the pairs .    </S>",
    "<S> the correlation between the observed equivalent widths of the absorbers in the adjacent lines of sight becomes poorer and poorer with increasing proper separation . </S>",
    "<S> a disc geometry with a column density profile @xmath8 , @xmath9 , is found to reasonably reproduce the data with @xmath10 kpc , but also spherical clouds with the same column density profile and a power - law distribution of radii may give a satisfactory representation of the observations . </S>"
