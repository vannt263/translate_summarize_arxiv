    "binary neutron star ( bns ) mergers are main sources of gravitational waves ( gws ) for ground - based laser - interferometric detectors , such as advanced ligo , advanced virgo and kagra in the coming five years @xcite .",
    "gw detection will open a new window for astronomy , and we will be able to test the theory of gravitation and to probe the supranuclear - density matter in neutron stars ( nss ) .",
    "statistical studies suggest that a few tens of merger events are observed in a year within a few hundred mpc distance @xcite .",
    "a simultaneous detection of electromagnetic ( em ) signals is indispensable for declaring a confident discovery of gws @xcite .",
    "since ` hearing ' a sound of gws entails a bad localization about degree@xmath3 at best , ` seeing ' em counterparts will not only increase gw sensitivity but also expand _ multi messenger astronomy _ by extracting information such as the host galaxy and its redshift .",
    "short @xmath4-ray bursts ( sgrbs ) are plausible counterparts to bns mergers @xcite .",
    "gws will verify the merger hypothesis for sgrbs .",
    "however , some observations suggest that sgrbs are beamed into a small angle @xcite .",
    "most sgrbs are off - axis and undetectable to us , albeit gw observation is biased towards the binary s rotational axis ( i.e. , probably the jet axis ) .",
    "the ` orphan ' afterglow , which is produced by the off - axis jet decelerated to a mildly relativistic velocity at a later time , is also dim .",
    "two promising models have been proposed for nearly isotropic em counterparts .",
    "one is the macronova or kilonova which shines on @xmath5 days after the merger in uv  optical bands via radioactive decay of _",
    "r_-process elements @xcite .",
    "the other is radio synchrotron emission from the collisions between the ejecta and the ambient medium , like @xmath4-ray burst ( grb ) afterglows , after @xmath5 years from the merger @xcite .",
    "both of them are based on non-/mildly relativistic outflows with @xmath6@xmath7 ( roughly an escape velocity of the ns ) from a compact binary merger .",
    "the outflows can be produced by neutrino - driven wind @xcite , magnetically driven wind @xcite , tidal ejection @xcite and shock - wave ejection @xcite ( see also below ) .",
    "recent fully general relativistic simulations show that the ejecta mass is @xmath8 for a wide range of parameters even without neutrino or magnetic effects @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we suggest a possibility of nearly omnidirectional ultrarelativistic counterparts to bns mergers for the first time to our knowledge except for the grb .",
    "we consider shock waves produced right after the bns collision @xcite .",
    "shock waves are launched from the heated ns core to the ns crust non - relativistically at first , and accelerate to a relativistic velocity down a steep density gradient in the ns crust .",
    "after the shock breakout from the surface , the shocked material expands into a nearly vacuum region , converting the shock - heated internal energy into kinetic energy .",
    "the resulting lorentz factor @xmath0 of the ejecta is larger for outer and less massive parts .",
    "such a transrelativistic acceleration has been discussed in the context of supernovae @xcite .",
    "we estimate the relativistic ejecta mass to be @xmath9 for @xmath10 , and calculate the synchrotron radiation from relativistic blast waves decelerated by the ambient medium and energized progressively by the inner catching - up ejecta .",
    "the ultrarelativistic nature makes the flare bright at an early time ( seconds  days ) and in high - energy bands ( x - ray  radio bands ) in contrast to the non-/mildly relativistic cases .",
    "we find flares are detectable by current x - ray , optical and radio instruments , such as _ swift _ xrt , pan - starrs and evla for our fiducial case .",
    "the counterpart signals the merger time more precisely than non-/mildly relativistic ones .",
    "the counterpart could also enable us to distinguish the merger types , because black hole ",
    "ns mergers are not likely to be accompanied by strong shocks for ultrarelativistic outflows .",
    "current 3d numerical simulations of bns mergers have not sufficiently resolved the ns crust .",
    "although the results for non-/mildly relativistic ejecta are solid and the existence of shock waves is implied by the heatup of the colliding region @xcite ; currently , it is not feasible to follow a tiny mass to a ultrarelativistic velocity because of numerical viscosity , artificial atmosphere and limited computational resources , even for newtonian gravity",
    ". therefore , it is worthwhile to highlight the impacts of ultrarelativistic outflows for motivating the future well - resolved calculations .",
    "we first consider the mass ejection right after the ns collision .",
    "the nss collide with each other due to the gravitational radiation reaction .",
    "the colliding part is shock heated up to a temperature of @xmath11 mev .",
    "because of an oblique collision , the shocked region has a pancake - like shape with the thickness @xmath12 km @xcite , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ] .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the hot material in the colliding region expands towards a cold , low - pressure region , i.e. , from the heated ns core to the ns crust .",
    "the striking difference of the pressure between them drives shock waves propagating the ns crust towards an ns surface .",
    "the initial shock velocity @xmath13 should be comparable to the sound velocity of the core material @xmath14 @xcite , where @xmath15 is the speed of light . at this stage",
    ", the shocked material can not escape from the merged remnant , because the expanding velocity is less than the escape velocity , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the mass and radius of the merged remnant , respectively .",
    "the shock is accelerated descending a steep density gradient in the ns crust with the thickness @xmath19 km .",
    "the density profile of the crust is approximately given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the rest - mass density , @xmath22 is the depth from the surface and @xmath23 is the polytropic index of the crust equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath24 as a fiducial value , because this is for the relativistic degenerate electron gas and is consistent with more detailed nuclear - theory - based eoss @xcite .",
    "the shock velocity increases as @xmath25 with @xmath26 for @xmath24 in the non - relativistic regime @xcite .",
    "once the shock is accelerated beyond @xmath27 , the shocked material can escape from the bns by converting thermal energy into kinetic energy to obtain @xmath28 later @xcite .",
    "specifically , the shock velocity increases by a factor of @xmath29 when the density drops by @xmath30 .",
    "the crust material outside this density can escape as ejecta .",
    "for @xmath31 , the ejecta mass is estimated to be @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a geometrical fraction of the crust mass @xmath34 that is swept by the shock ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "the ejecta is approximately spherical .",
    "the reason for this is that the shock is initially non - relativistic , and therefore expands into an angle given by the inverse of the lorentz factor , @xmath35 .",
    "no confinement mechanism works . since the ejecta geometry is not jet - like but annular , where the annulus is ejected in the _ yz _ plane for the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] , the solid angle is @xmath36 .    the outer and less massive ejecta accelerates to a ultrarelativistic velocity",
    "specifically , the shock attains a lorentz factor @xmath37 when the density drops by a factor of @xmath38 within a thin layer of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "then , after the breakout from the surface , the shocked material accelerates to a lorentz factor @xmath40 by converting the shock - heated internal energy into the kinetic energy with the aid of the pressure of the inner ejecta . to resolve the thin layer of @xmath41 in mesh - based simulations , a grid size of @xmath42 m",
    "is required .",
    "such a high - resolution simulation is not feasible at present and in the near - future .    to make a detailed estimate",
    ", we apply a transrelativistic acceleration model of a supernova exploding the stellar envelope @xcite . the kinetic energy of ejecta with a velocity above @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the ejecta velocity , is given by equation 56 of @xcite as and @xmath45 in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath46 an exact form of the distribution @xmath47 is given by equation 38 of @xcite . neither",
    "gravity nor rotation is expected to affect the shock and post - shock acceleration , since the shock crosses the crust in @xmath48 , which is much shorter than the dynamical time - scale and rotational period at the mass - shedding limit , @xmath35 ms .",
    "the heatup of the stellar interior will take @xmath49 , which might require detailed modelling .     for various polytropic indices @xmath23 and the ejected mass by the shock breakout @xmath50 .",

    "[ fig : kinetic ] shows the kinetic energy distribution of the ejecta @xmath53 .",

    "yields @xmath57 where we assume @xmath51 , @xmath58 km and @xmath24 .",
    "the high-@xmath0 component carries small but still appreciable energy for the emission as @xmath59 , while the mass is tiny as @xmath60 .",
    "the energy distribution becomes harder for a larger value of @xmath23 , providing a possible way to infer the eos of the ns crust in principle .",
    "the energy distribution is sensitive to the value of @xmath50 , and therefore @xmath13 and the polytropic index , @xmath23 .",
    "the density profile could be affected by the neutrino / magnetic wind , and the shock acceleration will not work efficiently when the density has a stellar - wind - like profile and does not go to zero rapidly .",
    "the breakdown of plane - parallel approximation in @xcite could modify the @xmath0 distribution ( but see their section 2.5 for aspherical explosions ) .",
    "some part of the ultrarelativistic ejecta may be decelerated before emission by surrounding material such as a tidally elongated ns , especially for an unequal - mass binary .",
    "the neutrino losses may decrease the acceleration pressure ( but other radiation components persist ) .",
    "the accurate estimation of @xmath50 and the @xmath0 distribution taking these caveats is left for future study .",
    "the ejecta may be also accelerated when density waves propagate across the entire core to the opposite surface .",
    "the amount of shock - breakout ejection would be larger by an order of magnitude due to a larger geometrical fraction .",
    "whether density waves propagate across the core depends on the ns structure , and thus on the eos of the ns core .",
    "next , we calculate the spectra and light curves of em signals applying the synchrotron shock model of the grb afterglow @xcite .",
    "the outflow generates a forward shock sweeping the ambient medium with a constant number density @xmath61 .",
    "a fraction @xmath62 of the internal energy released by the shock amplifies the magnetic field @xmath63 , while a fraction @xmath64 accelerates electrons with a lorentz factor distribution @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the number and lorentz factor of electrons , respectively , for @xmath68 ( a minimum value ) and @xmath69 .",
    "hereafter , we assume that the ejecta outspreads completely spherically , and give the lower limit of luminosity . if the ejecta is concentrated within an angle @xmath70 from the annular heated region , an observable angle decreases by @xmath71 but the isotropic energy increases by @xmath72 for a bns merger , and finally detection rates will increase by @xmath73 .",
    "our fiducial model can be detected up to @xmath74 mpc for optimal observational bands and the value of @xmath61 , as shown later .",
    "the outflow carries larger energy in inner , lower @xmath0 part in eqs .   and .",
    "the slow flow rear - ends and refreshes the external shock which is decelerated by the ambient density @xcite . we illustrate formulae for a power - law distribution of the kinetic energy , @xmath75 where @xmath76 erg and @xmath77 for our fiducial case with @xmath10 , and @xmath78 and @xmath79 rise as @xmath0 drops in equation .",
    "we also adopt an ultrarelativistic approximation , @xmath10 .",
    "note that @xmath80 and @xmath63 are both proportional to @xmath0 in this approximation .",
    "once the fastest flow begins to decelerate , the catching - up condition for a slower flow is given by @xmath81 @xcite , where @xmath82 is the proton mass and @xmath83 is the shock radius .",

    "the ultrarelativistic counterpart proposed here is bright from the early epoch soon after the bns merger , and decays rapidly .",
    "while this feature is advantageous to confirm a tight association with gws , the observation will require efficient strategies .",

    "the other strategy is prompt follow - up by em instruments in response to rapid alerts from gw detector networks .",

    "the low ambient density is suggested by the radio observations of sgrbs @xcite .",

    "follow - up observation in optical and radio bands has also to be performed as rapid as possible after gw detection to cover the localization error efficiently during bright emission .",
    "detecting the short - lived emission proposed in this letter will be more challenging for typical localization errors , 10@xmath136 dependent on the detector network configuration , than for optimistic localization errors , @xmath137 .",
    "we expect that these detectors will always find the emission by fully covering the gw localization error region if it is @xmath138 , which might be possible for the merger at 100 mpc .",
    "the detection probability may be estimated by the fraction of the error region that follow - up observations can cover before the emission fades away .",

    "the number of available pointings and the total fov is estimated by comparing these values to required integration time of each detector , and the probability is found .",
    "by contrast , if the localization error is @xmath142 or the emission is dimmer due to a larger distance or lower ambient density , xrt might find the emission only @xmath143 of the events .",
    "lsst and evla will be able to detect the emission even in such cases .",
    "we would not like to be conclusive at this point , however , due to enormous uncertainties associated with the ambient density , gw localization errors including shapes of them , and the delay from gw detection to follow - up observations .",
    "we also speculate that gev ",
    "tev @xmath4-rays could be generated via inverse compton scatterings or hadronic processes , such as _ p_@xmath4 collisions .",
    "if energy @xmath144 is converted to @xmath4-rays with typical energy @xmath145 , an expected number of photons @xmath146 for a detector with area @xmath147 on the earth will be @xmath148 this suggests that km@xmath3 future instruments such as cta could also detect em signals in @xmath4-rays .",
    "the tev @xmath4-rays are not attenuated by the infrared background at @xmath125 mpc .",
    "ultrarelativistic outflows could also be produced by other mechanisms such as the poynting wind from the ns surface with a small baryon load like in the magnetar models for grbs @xcite . in this case",
    ", the em signals could arise from the magnetic reconnection without the radioactivity or the ambient medium .    before closing this section",
    ", we again summarize the caveats of our model and necessary studies in the future .",
    "our proposed ejection mechanism is based on analytically idealized shock and post - shock acceleration .",
