    "lyman-@xmath0  emitting galaxies provide a valuable probe of reionization , because resonant scattering of lyman-@xmath0  photons in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) can suppress the observed lyman-@xmath0  line by a factor of @xmath9 for any neutral fraction @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "such strong flux suppression will cause a change in the lyman-@xmath0  luminosity function that should be obvious especially since lyman-@xmath0  galaxies show little evolution at @xmath11 , either in luminosity function @xcite or physical properties @xcite .",
    "early studies concluded that the igm neutral fraction was already small at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "more recent work has established the lyman-@xmath0  luminosity function at both @xmath13 and @xmath14 to considerable accuracy @xcite , showing a modest but statistically significant difference between these observed lyman-@xmath0  luminosity functions : the @xmath15 luminosity function is below that at @xmath16 , and the difference can be adequately characterized by a pure luminosity evolution by a factor of @xmath17 @xcite .    yet , other lyman-@xmath0  based tests for reionization including the apparent spatial clustering of lyman-@xmath0  galaxies @xcite , the minimum ionized volume around observed lyman-@xmath0sources @xcite , and lyman-@xmath0  line profiles @xcite show little evidence for neutral gas at @xmath12 .",
    "this leaves an open question is lower lyman-@xmath0  luminosity function at @xmath15 due to neutral gas , or is it an intrinsic evolution in the galaxy populations ?    to distinguish between these possibilities",
    ", we can look to still higher redshifts , where the igm neutral fraction should be higher and its effects on lyman-@xmath0   stronger .",
    "the highest redshift readily accessible to lyman-@xmath0  searches using ccds is @xmath18 , in the 9650  window in the night sky oh emission spectrum .",
    "we are pursuing a 9650  narrowband survey using the imacs imaging spectrograph on the 6.5 m magellan  i baade telescope at las campanas observatory @xcite .",
    "we surveyed 465 square arcminutes , corresponding to @xmath19 .",
    "after a careful selection , we found 6 z@xmath206.96  lae candidates @xcite . to confirm whether these are real laes",
    ", we obtained multi - object spectra with imacs . in this _",
    ", we present the spectrum of 3 , which was identified as a candidate redshift @xmath2 lyman-@xmath0  emitting galaxy ( candidate lae 3 ) in @xcite . our spectroscopy reveals a single , isolated lyman-@xmath0  line at redshift @xmath21 .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt a @xmath22cdm `` concordance cosmology '' with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "we observed our candidate @xmath2 lyman-@xmath0  galaxies using the inamori magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ) on the 6.5 m magellan  i baade telescope on the nights of 2930 december 2010 , and 8 february 2011 .",
    "the february data were of lower quality and are not used here .",
    "we used custom multi - slit masks , shared between two primary observing programs .",
    "we selected the f/2 camera and the 300-line red - blazed grism with 1  slitlets as the best compromise between areal coverage , spectral coverage , and spectral resolution .",
    "observations were split among five slit masks ( two per night in december , and one in february ) .",
    "the time per mask and observing conditions are summarized in table  [ mask_obs_table ] . while the position angle of the masks were not all identical , the data were taken without dithering the telescope .",
    "moreover , the targets were centered on their slitlets , and 3  is compact compared to the seeing .",
    "this allows us to combine all of the spectroscopic data into a single 1d spectrum ( see below ) .",
    ".summary of slit mask observations .",
    "[ mask_obs_table ] [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     to address the  possibility and further improve our constraints on , we examine equivalent widths . following @xcite , we combine our spectroscopic line flux with optical magnitude limits of 27.9 , 27.6 , and 27.3 mag ( @xmath26 , ab ) in g@xmath27 , r@xmath27 , and i@xmath27 filters respectively .",
    "since star - forming galaxies have @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 .",
    "the nondetection in these optical images then implies a @xmath26 limit @xmath30 ( observer frame ) .    while  and h@xmath0 emission line sources with equivalent widths this large exist @xcite , they are exceptional , rare objects . in @xcite , we estimated the numbers expected in our survey based on published line luminosity functions @xcite and equivalent width distributions @xcite .",
    "we found that @xmath31  emitters and @xmath32 h@xmath0 emitters are expected .",
    "emitters have generally smaller equivalent widths .",
    "we found _ no _ -selected objects with @xmath33 } ) \\approx 425 { \\rm \\aa}$ ] in the samples from @xcite ( 30 objects ) , @xcite ( 24 objects ) , @xcite ( 11 objects ) , or @xcite ( 400 objects ) .",
    "thus , @xmath34 of  emitters might enter our sample as lae candidates .",
    "the luminosity function from @xcite suggests that our survey volume should contain @xmath35  galaxies . among these",
    ", @xmath36 object should pass our lyman-@xmath0  selection criteria .",
    "thus , the aggregate sample of foreground emitters expected in our survey is @xmath37 galaxy .",
    "in contrast , our survey volume at @xmath38 should contain between @xmath39 and @xmath40 lyman-@xmath0galaxies with line fluxes @xmath41 , based on the @xmath12 luminosity functions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we thus regard lyman-@xmath0  as the best interpretation of the observed emission line .",
    "redshift @xmath2 is the current frontier in reionization studies , an area of active exploration where our observational knowledge is growing rapidly .",
    "the recently discovered quasar at @xmath42 ( mortlock et al 2011 ) , combined with spectroscopic followup ( and occasional confirmation ) of @xmath43 galaxy candidates from hst wfc3 surveys , provide an unprecedented look at this epoch .",
    "observations of these objects seem to favor the continued existence of significant neutral intergalactic gas as late as @xmath43 .",
    "this is surprising , given that microwave background polarization data from wmap favor a characteristic reionization redshift @xmath44 , and that the igm at @xmath45 is highly ionized , with a neutral fraction of only 14% based on quasar spectra ( fan et al 2006 ) .",
    "nonetheless , the ionized bubble around the @xmath42 quasar appears too small to be comfortably explained in a fully ionized medium , unless the quasar is itself remarkably young ( @xmath46 years ) ( bolton et al 2011 ) .",
    "similarly , three independent research groups have argued that the fraction of @xmath43 lyman break candidates showing lyman-@xmath0  emission appears smaller than would be expected in an ionized medium ( vanzella et al 2010 ; stark et al 2010 ; ono et al 2011 ; schenker et al 2011 ; pentericci et al 2011 ) .",
    "still , these results depend on the reliability of photometric selection criteria , and a contamination of order 50% could explain the observations without recourse to neutral gas ( e.g. , schenker et al 2011 ) .",
    "lyman-@xmath0  galaxy surveys offer a complementary approach to studying reionization .",
    "the underlying physics is the same as for spectroscopic followup of lyman break samples , but the survey selection proceeds differently , leading to different potential selection biases .",
    "the uncertainties in the method are likewise very different from those associated with the quasar near - zone measurement @xcite , or the gunn - peterson trough @xcite . because of this",
    ", conclusions about cosmological reionization will be strongest when they are based on multiple independent methods .",
    "the work we present here is only the second large - area narrowband survey for for lyman-@xmath0  galaxies at redshift @xmath18 , following on the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic confirmation of 3  demonstrates that such objects can be identified at flux levels considerably fainter than the @xmath47 line of iok-1 @xcite or the recently reported @xmath48 narrowband - selected lyman-@xmath0  galaxy sxdf - nb1006 - 2 @xcite .",
    "our observed line flux , @xmath49 , corresponds to a rest - frame line luminosity of only @xmath50 .",
    "this is at or below the characteristic line luminosity @xmath51 from schechter function fits to @xmath12 lyman-@xmath0samples ( e.g. , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xcite ; @xmath54 and @xmath55,@xcite ) .",
    "thus , our survey has achieved sensitivity to typical lyman-@xmath0  emitters . were the @xmath56 luminosity function unchanged from that at @xmath15",
    ", we would expect our survey volume to contain 11 or 2.6 lyman-@xmath0  emitters brighter than 3 , based on the lf of @xcite or @xcite respectively .",
    "this reflects large differences in expectations from different published @xmath15 luminosity functions .",
    "we will present a detailed analysis of our survey s constraints on the lyman-@xmath0  luminosity function in a future paper , after we have more sensitive spectra for our remaining candidates .",
    "for now , the galaxy 3  is among the few most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxies known , and the faintest to be discovered through a direct search for lyman-@xmath0  line emission .",
