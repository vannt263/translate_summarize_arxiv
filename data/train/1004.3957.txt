    "the family of layered ruthenates is in the focus of interest since the discovery of superconductivity in sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2@xcite whose unconventional nature is still under debate .",
    "the series ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  which arises from sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2by substitution of sr by ca exhibits a variety of exciting phenomena on its own . though the replacement of sr by ca does not change the number of charge carriers , the electronic and magnetic behavior is closely coupled to slight structural changes and varies considerably as function of the sr - content x @xcite .",
    "ca@xmath11ruo@xmath2is a mott insulator and antiferromagnetically ordered below 110  k @xcite , while for x@xmath120.18 , the ground state is metallic .",
    "the strongly enhanced values of the magnetic susceptibility indicate that the system is close to a ferromagnetic instability around x=0.5 @xcite .",
    "ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2-samples with x@xmath130.5 exhibit a remarkably large value of the sommerfeld coefficient of the specific heat in the range of heavy - fermion compounds .",
    "moreover , for 0.2@xmath14x@xmath140.5 a metamagnetic transition from a state with low susceptibility , reminiscent of antiferromagnetic correlations , to a state with high magnetic polarization is observed @xcite .",
    "the metamagnetic transition is also observed in the closely related bilayer ruthenate sr@xmath15ru@xmath11o@xmath16  @xcite , where the discussion about quantum - critical behavior has generated further interest .",
    "the high concentration dependence of the ground state in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  points to a complex interplay of distinct magnetic correlations .",
    "a precise characterization of the magnetic excitations in the layered ruthenates seems interesting due to several reasons : first , ferromagnetic fluctuations are considered to play an important role in the superconducting pairing in sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2 .",
    "as ferromagnetic fluctuations are difficult to study in this material , insight can be more easily gained from the ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  compounds .",
    "in addition , the complex magnetism in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  arrises from the interplay between structural and orbital degrees of freedom , which is relevant in many transition - metal oxides . an orbital - selective mott transition has been proposed to explain the fascinating magnetism in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2@xcite .",
    "before we discuss the experimental findings , we briefly introduce the general concepts to describe magnetic fluctuations in itinerant magnets and we summarize previous studies on magnetic correlations in layered ruthenates introducing the magnetic contributions to the magnetic scattering in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  by the aid of an intensity map measured for x=0.2 .",
    "we then discuss in separate sections the three antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic components of the excitation spectrum in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  with @xmath3 , and finally we analyze the effect of magnetic fields on these correlations .",
    "the magnetic properties of a material are characterized by its wave - vector and frequency dependent magnetic susceptibility , @xmath17 , which contains the entire information about the static , @xmath18 , as well as about the dynamic phenomena . magnetic inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) measures the imaginary part of the susceptibility @xmath19 as function of wave vector and of frequency ( energy transfer @xmath20 ) , whereas macroscopic methods only access the case q=0 and ( compared to ins ) @xmath21 .",
    "more precisely , the ins cross section is given by @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the magnetic form factor .",
    "the imaginary part , directly experimentally accessible by this formula , is connected to the real part of the susceptibility , @xmath24 , via the kramers - kronig relation .",
    "the spin dynamics in itinerant paramagnetic systems like the layered ruthenates has the character of fluctuations , i.  e.  correlations limited in space and in time , around the paramagnetic ground state .",
    "@xmath25 is non - zero everywhere or in large portions of * q*,@xmath26 space , and it is the structure of this excitation continuum that contains the information about the magnetic interactions .    for an itinerant compound one may analytically calculate the susceptibility @xmath25 via the lindhard function , i.e. by a sum over all possible excitations of electrons from occupied into empty states .",
    "correlation effects can be modelled by taking into account an additional interaction parameter ( see for instance ref .  ) yielding an enhancement of the generalized susceptibility .",
    "this calculation , however , is in many materials not feasible due to the insufficient knowledge about the electronic band structure . in such cases",
    "it is still possible to deduce expressions for @xmath25 that are valid near the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic instabilities , i.  e.  for critical fluctuations .",
    "expanding the inverse susceptibility as @xmath27 ( see refs . ) , the imaginary part of the susceptibility is conveniently written in the form @xmath28 at different @xmath29 , the frequency spectrum has thus qualitatively the same form , which frequently is referred to as  ( single ) relaxor  in the literature , and which has its maximum at @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is expressed as @xmath32 .",
    "the form of @xmath33 depends on the nature of the magnetic instability , i.  e.  if it is ferromagnetic ( propagation vector @xmath34=0 ) or antiferromagnetic ( all @xmath34@xmath350 , i.  e.  possibly incommensurate ) . in the ferromagnetic case ,",
    "one obtains @xmath36 while in the antiferromagnetic case @xmath37 the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 depend on the microscopic details and on how close the system is to the magnetic phase transition . from the phenomenological point of view",
    ", they can be used to parameterize the magnetic fluctuations in * q*,@xmath26 space in a convenient and remarkably simple way .",
    "@xmath39 defines the length scale , which may be regarded as a correlation length , and @xmath38 defines the energy scale .",
    "the ferromagnetic case differs from the antiferromagnetic one by the additional factor @xmath29 in @xmath33 , which causes @xmath33 to vanish for @xmath40 . in spite of its continuum character ,",
    "the shape of @xmath41 resembles that of a dispersive excitation .",
    "the maxima in constant energy scans lie on a curve initially linear in @xmath29 with slope @xmath42 . due to its vague resemblance to a magnon in the ordered state , such an excitation",
    "is often called a paramagnon .    the antiferromagnetic fluctuation yields a qualitatively different intensity distribution : it has a maximum at ( @xmath34,@xmath38 )",
    ", whose energy width is determined by @xmath38 , and the @xmath29-width ( fwhm ) is 1.7@xmath43 at @xmath44 . at higher energies ,",
    "the excitation is broader in @xmath29 , but always peaked at @xmath34 ; there is thus no dispersive feature .",
    "an illustration of how the intensity is distributed in both cases will be given in the context of the discussion of the experimental results later on , see section vi .",
    "due to the limitations by neutron flux and by signal strength , large samples are necessary to study magnetic excitations in layered ruthenates by ins .",
    "the experiments have been performed on single crystals of ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  with concentrations x=0.2 and 0.62 , that have been obtained by a floating zone method at the university of kyoto and had masses of 1.9  g and 1.8  g respectively .",
    "different triple axis spectrometers have been used : 4f1 , 4f2 , 1 t and 2 t at the llb , saclay , in14 , in12 , in22 and in20 at the ill , grenoble , and panda at frm - ii , garching . on the thermal neutron spectrometers 1 t , 2 t and in22 we used a fixed final neutron wave vector k@xmath45=2.662  @xmath46  and graphite filters .",
    "on in20 we have used the newly available flatcone multi - detector with k@xmath45=3  @xmath46  in order to obtain a mapping of the intensity distribution @xcite . on the cold neutron spectrometers ( unless otherwise stated ) k@xmath45  has been set to 1.5  @xmath46  and beryllium filters were used to suppress higher orders . in all cases , focusing monochromators and analyzers have been employed .",
    "magnetic fields up to 10  t have been applied using vertical cryomagnets .",

    "( a ) : intensity map over several brillouin zones at a constant value of l=1.4 . a smooth background has been subtracted .",
    "data was taken on in20 using the flat - cone setup .",
    "( b ) : magnetic scattering in one brillouin zone , obtained from the data in ( a ) by projecting to the range h , k=[-0.5,0.5 ] , thereby averaging the scattering from different brillouin zones ( after correction for the ru magnetic form factor ) .",

    "( e ) : the same for a diagonal cut through the brillouin zone through ( 0,0,1.4 ) .",
    "the data in all parts of the figure are normalized to a monitor count rate that corresponds to approximately 1 minute counting time per point .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    in order to access different regions in reciprocal space , the samples have been mounted either in [ 100]-[010 ] orientation , i.  e.  with @xmath48  and @xmath49  in the scattering plane , or in an [ 100]-[001 ] orientation that gives access to momentum transfers along @xmath50 . here and in the following the notation is based on a unit cell that corresponds to that of sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2 , i.  e.  a = b=3.76  @xmath51 , and c=12.65  @xmath51  for x=0.62 and c=12.55  @xmath51  for x=0.2 .",
    "this notation neglects the structural distortions  a rotation of the ruo@xmath52-octahedra around the vertical axis and an additional tilt in the case of x=0.2 @xcite  that have to be described in a larger unit cell ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "samples were well characterized by neutron diffraction ; in particular , by regarding characteristic superstructure reflections of the structural distortions , we can state that the ca@xmath9sr@xmath10ruo@xmath2  sample was twinned with approximately equal amounts of both twins .",
    "this compound is orthorhombic with a small splitting of the in - plane lattice constants due to the tilt distortion .",
    "furthermore , we verified that the structure corresponds to the so - called d - pbca phase and not to the l - pbca phase , which is in close proximity in the phase diagram @xcite . in d - pbca ,",
    "the octahedra of next - nearest layers rotate in opposite phase yielding a doubling of the c lattice parameter .",
    "all measurements were carried out with unpolarized neutron beams .",
    "phonon scattering should not occur in our experiments , as no optical phonons exist in the analyzed energy and @xmath29-range @xcite , and the contamination by acoustic phonons is avoided when working around q=(1,0,0 ) .",
    "there is no bragg scattering at this q - point because of the symmetry of the crystal structure ( including the distortions ) ; but as argued below ( 1,0,0 ) can nevertheless be considered as a magnetic zone center .",
    "the measured signals are consistent to the previous results on magnetic excitations in the ruthenates ( for instance refs .  ) , and studies of the q- and temperature dependence further corroborate the magnetic character . using the lattice dynamical model described in ref .",
    "we may calculate the distribution of the dynamic structure factor of an acoustic phonon branch around q=(2,0,0 ) and fold it with the experimental resolution in order to describe a phonon scan . using the same folding for the magnetic data it has been possible to assign absolute susceptibility units to our data .",
    "magnetic excitations have so far been studied by ins in several layered ruthenates .",
    "the most detailed description is at present available for sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2  ( refs .  ) .",
    "furthermore , the bilayer compound sr@xmath15ru@xmath11o@xmath16  has been investigated ( refs .  )",
    ".the excitations in these materials have the character of fluctuations that are both relatively broad in * q * and @xmath26 . in sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2",
    ", these fluctuations reside at * q*=(0.3,0.3,0 ) , i.  e.  at incommensurate wave vectors on the diagonal of the brillouin zone . in sr@xmath15ru@xmath11o@xmath16 ,",
    "excitations at two inequivalent wave vectors have been identified that are on the @xmath48  ( respectively @xmath49 ) axis of the brillouin zone . in sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2 ,",
    "no dependence on the l - component of * q*=(h , k , l ) has been found , apart the smooth decrease towards high q that is governed by the ruthenium magnetic form factor .",
    "this shows that there is no relevant magnetic correlation between moments in different ruo@xmath54 layers .",
    "the same applies to sr@xmath15ru@xmath11o@xmath16  with the exception that there is a strong magnetic interaction between the two layers of one double - block .",
    "it is thus sufficient to regard the two in - plane dimensions and to neglect the l - component of q. the 2d brillouin zone is quadratic , and all q with integer h , k are zone centers , i.  e.  any excitation at such q , in particular at ( 1,0,0 ) or ( 0,0,l ) , exhibits a ferromagnetic character .    in sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2 ,",
    "the magnetic excitation at q@xmath6=(0.3,0.3,l ) is very well understood on the basis of the underlying electronic band structure@xcite ; the fermi surface consists of three sheets , and q@xmath6  is the nesting vector connecting the so - called @xmath55 and @xmath56 sheets which arise from the ruthenium 4d@xmath57 and 4d@xmath58 orbitals@xcite . in sr@xmath15ru@xmath11o@xmath16 ,",
    "the fermi surface is far more complex@xcite , so it is less simple to identify which parts of it give the relevant contribution .    in the single layer ruthenates , however ,",
    "there are other wave vectors at which magnetic correlations have been observed : in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  with x=0.62 ( ref .  )",
    "large contributions at the incommensurate wave vectors ( 0.22,0,0 ) and equivalent ones have been observed ; in ca@xmath9sr@xmath10ruo@xmath2  ( ref .  ) , similar excitations have been seen , and even a separation in two contributions at q@xmath59=(0.12,0,0 ) and q@xmath60=(0.27,0,0 ) could be resolved . in all these respects ,",
    "the ca - doped materials ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  are thus fundamentally different from sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2 .",
    "finally , ferromagnetic correlations have been identified in ca@xmath9sr@xmath10ruo@xmath2  at elevated temperatures or upon application of a magnetic field @xcite . to",
    "what extent ferromagnetic correlations play a role also in sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2  and its superconductivity , remains so far an open question .",
    "an overview of the distribution of scattered intensity is obtained from the data in figure [ fig1 ] taken for ca@xmath9sr@xmath10ruo@xmath2 , which covers a wide region of a plane in reciprocal space .",
    "the data have been obtained using the flatcone multi - detector option of the in20 spectrometer@xcite with the sample oriented in the a , b - plane . by tilting the sample and by placing the detector array in an inclined position out of the horizontal plane just above the direct beam",
    ", a map of scattering vectors with a constant finite vertical component of l=1.4 is obtained .",
    "the accessible horizontal components of q ( h and k ) are small in this configuration , which is convenient for the study of magnetic scattering due to the form factor .    in the intensity map in figure [ fig1](a )",
    "one clearly sees the magnetic intensity centered at the points with integer h and k , in accordance to the above discussed two - dimensional character of the magnetic fluctuations . due to the magnetic form factor",
    ", the intensity is weaker , the higher the modulus of q , i.  e.  in the outer regions of the map .",
    "the sketch in figure [ fig1](c ) summarizes all the different positions of the signals that have been discussed in the beginning of this section , see also ref . .",
    "the cross - like intensity pattern which dominates in the intensity map , in particular when reducing it to one ( 2d ) brillouin zone , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , originates from the superposition of intensity stemming from the signals at q@xmath4  and q@xmath5 . the resolution , effectively broadened also by the averaging over several zones , is not sufficient to separate these contributions in the map , as it is well possible in the data previously collected at lower energy transfer and with different experimental geometry @xcite .",
    "the intensity at q@xmath6  is relatively weak compared to the one near the zone center , and therefore this q@xmath6-signal is only weakly visible in the colour plot . when integrating the two - dimensional data set over a stripe of about 0.1  @xmath46width that runs along the diagonal of the brillouin zone , these signals are clearly distinguishable ( figure [ fig1](e ) ) .",

    "( c ) and ( d ) : transverse scans ( background subtracted ) across ( 1,0,0 ) , crossing the positions q@xmath4  and q@xmath5  at two temperatures .",
    "scans were taken with an energy transfer of 4  mev on the 1 t spectrometer .",
    "[ icfig1 ] ]    in this section we discuss the different contributions to the incommensurate scattering which exhibit an antiferromagnetic character .",
    "the observation of peaks at q=(0.7,0.3,0 ) and ( 1.3,0.3,0 ) in ca@xmath7sr@xmath8ruo@xmath2 , see fig .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) , proves that the signal which arises from nesting of the @xmath55 and @xmath56 bands in sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2  and which has been observed in ca@xmath9sr@xmath10ruo@xmath2   as well , see fig .  1 and ref .",
    ", is also present for x=0.62 .",
    "fitting the position of these peaks on different equivalent q - vectors yields h , k=0.301@xmath610.005 , i.e. the same values as in the case of pure sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2@xcite .",
    "this signal thus indicates that the nesting of the @xmath55 and @xmath56 band remains intact despite all changes in the crystal structure and in the fermi surfaces .",
    "first - principles calculations@xcite come to the conclusion that apart the back - folding effect the @xmath55 and @xmath56 sheets of the fermi surface are only little affected by the rotational distortion of the structure @xcite .",
    "the invariance of this nesting signal also suggests that the filling of these bands with respect to the @xmath62-band does not significantly change from the values in sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2 . in a simple model that assumes a rigid filling of the band structure",
    ", we calculate that an increase of the occupation number @xmath63 by about 0.1 electron would already shift the nesting peak more than 0.02 in h and k along the diagonal of the brillouin zone  by far more than the maximum shift consistent with the experimental error bars .",
    "even though the details of the real band structure might slightly change this estimation , it imposes a very low boundary of the shift of electrons among the orbitals and is thus in clear contradiction to the proposed scenario of an orbital selective mott transition@xcite which requires integer filling of the bands .",
    "2(c ) and ( d ) show scans along the @xmath49  axis across * q*=(1,0,0 ) for x=0.62 .",
    "the shape of the signal resembles closely that in ca@xmath9sr@xmath10ruo@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "it exhibits steep edges at about h=@xmath610.35 and has , apart a minimum in the center , a broad and flat plateau in between .",
    "these features are observed in scans at a number of different energy transfers and temperatures .",
    "a satisfactory fit can thus _ not _ be performed with a single symmetric ( gaussian ) contribution of whatever width , but requires at least two contributions on both sides .",
    "a fit using symmetric gaussian peaks yields the positions @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which are nearly the same values as those reported for ca@xmath9sr@xmath10ruo@xmath2@xcite .",
    "the obtained description of the data is fully satisfying , for ca@xmath7sr@xmath8ruo@xmath2  as well as for ca@xmath9sr@xmath10ruo@xmath2 ; furthermore , the description is consistent for both cases .",
    "the large width and the significant overlap of the single contributions do not allow us to resolve if there is even more structure intrinsic to these fluctuations or not .",
    "at least an additional ferromagnetic component , which is discussed in detail in the next section , still plays some role at this energy and is the likely origin of the less well pronounced minimum at ( 1,0,0 ) and the slightly lower @xmath66 in comparison to ca@xmath9sr@xmath10ruo@xmath2 .",
    "it appears most interesting to associate the different incommensurate scattering contributions with nested parts of the fermi surface , similar to the case of the excitations at q@xmath6  in sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2 .",
    "the analysis for ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  is , however , much more difficult because the structural distortions and the large unit cell render the fermi surface very complex , and the present knowledge about the fermi - surface in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  is insufficient to clearly assign the origin of the q@xmath4and q@xmath5  peaks .",
    "there seems to be an overall consensus concerning the electronic structure of the two end members , sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2  and ca@xmath11ruo@xmath2 . in sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2",
    "the four electrons are equally distributed amongst the three t@xmath67-bands yielding a filling of 2/3 for the three orbitals @xcite . for this electronic arrangement",
    "the van - hove singularity near q=(0,0.5,0 ) in the @xmath62-band associated with the d@xmath68-orbitals is situated only slightly above the fermi - energy .",
    "on the other side of the phase diagram , the mott - state in ca@xmath11ruo@xmath2  is associated with orbital ordering driven through the strong structural changes .",
    "the pronounced flattening of the octahedron in ca@xmath11ruo@xmath2@xcite results in a full occupation of the d@xmath68-orbitals and in half - filled d@xmath69- and d@xmath70-orbital states undergoing the mott transition @xcite .",
    "qualitatively this picture of orbital order seems to be valid for all ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  undergoing the metal - insulator transition , i.e. for x@xmath140.2 .",
    "the electronic structure of the metallic samples at slightly larger sr content studied here remains matter of controversy both in experiment and in theory .",
    "anisimov et al .",
    "@xcite proposed an orbital - selctive mott transition in the idea that correlations should first result in a localization of the d@xmath69- and d@xmath70-states , because the corresponding bands exhibit a smaller band width in pure sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2 .",
    "the rotation of the octahedra around the c - axis , however , are found to strongly influence the @xmath62-band associated with the d@xmath68-orbitals due to the variation of the hopping @xcite .",

    "the electronic band - structure calculations hence suggest that the @xmath62-band associated with the d@xmath68-orbitals is much closer to localization than the other bands in disagreement with the initial idea of an orbital selective mott transition in the d@xmath69-d@xmath70-orbitals @xcite .",
    "there is strong experimental evidence that the anomalous properties of ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  with x@xmath130.5 are mainly associated with the @xmath62-band and with the d@xmath68-orbitals .",
    "a spin - density study on ca@xmath71sr@xmath72ruo@xmath2  directly proves that the high magnetic polarization in these phases arises from the d@xmath68-orbitals @xcite which are hybridized with in - plane oxygen orbitals .",
    "optical spectroscopy also identifies the d@xmath68-band renormalization as the origin of the heavy - mass behavior in ca@xmath71sr@xmath72ruo@xmath2@xcite .",

    "@xcite find that all bands cross the fermi - level for this concentration .",

    "the @xmath62-band width around the wave vectors associated with the van - hove singularity , ( 0.5,0,0 ) , is remarkably small ; it amounts to only a few mev @xcite , similar to the values reported for sr@xmath15ru@xmath11o@xmath16  @xcite .",
    "the extreme reduction of the @xmath62-band width results in a high electronic density of states at the fermi level which manifests itself in the heavy - mass states @xcite as well as in the remarkably strong thermal expansion anomalies in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  for 0.2@xmath14x@xmath140.6 @xcite .    besides the signals at q@xmath6  all magnetic correlations observed in our ins experiments should be attributed to the @xmath62-band .",
    "the amplitude of the incommensurate signal at q@xmath4  and q@xmath5  in ca@xmath7sr@xmath8ruo@xmath2@xcite is three times larger than that of the incommensurate nesting signal in pure sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2@xcite .",
    "the rotational distortion of the structure should have a relatively small effect on the d@xmath69- and d@xmath70-bands , so it appears very unlikely that the magnetic signal associated with these bands changes so drastically between sr@xmath11ruo@xmath2  and ca@xmath7sr@xmath8ruo@xmath2 .",
    "this conclusion is corroborated by the fact that the q@xmath6-signal , which can unambiguously be attributed to these bands , remains constant between x=2 and x=0.2 .",
    "as there is little change in the q@xmath4  and q@xmath5-signals for x=0.2 and 0.62 , it appears reasonable to assume that for x=0.2 this incommensurate scattering does not arise from the d@xmath69- and d@xmath70-bands neither . although the ferromagnetic fluctuations originate from the @xmath62 band and the high density of states at the fermi level , it is still possible that some sections of the @xmath62 surface are at the same time responsible for the signals at q@xmath4  and q@xmath5@xcite . in a very simple approach , the hole - like fermi surface for x=0.5 @xcite may explain a peak in the lindhard susceptibility associated with electron transfer from ( 0.5,+@xmath73,0 ) to ( 0.5,-@xmath73,0 ) and thereby an incommensurate signal on the tetragonal axes , but for any quantitative statement",
    "the knowledge about the electronic structure in ca@xmath71sr@xmath72ruo@xmath2  is clearly insufficient .      like other excitations ,",
    "the incommensurate magnetic fluctuations contribute to the specific heat .",
    "their contribution to the coefficient of the electronic specific heat at low temperature can be approximated as@xcite @xmath74 where the sum is over the whole brillouin zone .",

    "the values of the susceptibility related to the ferromagnetic signal are , concerning their absolute values as well as their variations with temperature and magnetic field , in perfect agreement with the macroscopically determined susceptibilities , proving that this ins signal reflects the magnetic correlations that determine the macroscopic physical properties .",
    "the application of an external magnetic field at low temperature suppresses the incommensurate part of the response . in ca@xmath9sr@xmath10ruo@xmath2 , a substantial ferromagnetic component reappears , reflecting the metamagnetic transition . at high field",
    ", the spectral weight of the ferromagnetic response is shifted towards higher energy for x=0.2 and 0.62 , opening a gap that roughly corresponds to the zeeman energy of an electron in the magnetic field . in ca@xmath9sr@xmath10ruo@xmath2  a dispersive excitation mode , corresponding to a magnon in a ferromagnet ,",
    "is observed , which is well defined near the zone center and low energies , and which significantly broadens at energies above 3  mev .",
    "although only two concentrations have been studied here , x=0.2 and 0.62 , the results are most likely of relevance for the whole range 0.2@xmath143x@xmath1431.5 of the series ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 . in this region of the phase diagram , the materials are paramagnetic and metallic at all temperatures . the samples with x=0.2 and 0.62 have , though , to be regarded as quite different concerning their physical properties , as there is a second - order structural phase transition ( associated with ruo@xmath52  octahedra tilting ) at x=0.5 ; ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  seems approaches the ferromagnetic instability for x decreasing towards 0.5 , while a strongly reduced susceptibility and the metamagnetic transition are observed at x@xmath140.5 .",
    "it is thus important to realize that the measured magnetic correlations can be well described in a common model in which the change of only few parameters leads to the large differences between the nearly ferro- and nearly antiferromagnetic compounds .",
    "the ferromagnetic correlations in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2  depend sensitively on the sr - concentration x and seem to tune the different magnetic properties with the doping .",
    "the ferromagnetic instability in general arises from the high density of states close to the fermi surface of the @xmath62 sheet , which has been reveals in several arpes studies@xcite . due to this high density of states",
    "the system becomes very sensitive upon structural changes , as it is best documented in the thermal expansion anomalies @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the comprehensive ins experiments clearly reveal the image of competing magnetic instabilities in ca@xmath0sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .",
    "the whole spectrum of magnetic correlations is well described in the presented phenomenological model with ferromagnetic and incommensurate antiferromagnetic contributions . in this competition , it is mainly the variation of the ferromagnetic component as function of sr - concentration x , temperature and magnetic field , that governs the physical properties .",
