    "in the absence of dissipation the two - dimensional models of the planetary atmosphere and of the magnetized plasma can be reduced to differential equations having the same structure : the charney equation for the nonlinear rossby waves , in the physics of the atmosphere ( charney 1948 ) ; and the hasegawa - mima equation for drift wave turbulence , in plasma physics ( hesagawa and mima 1978 ) .",
    "one of the characteristics of these equations is the presence of an intrinsic length parameter , which can be seen from the fact that there is no space scale invariance , in contrast to the euler equation ( see horton and hasegawa 1994 ) .",
    "this length is the rossby radius for the atmosphere and the ion sonic larmor radius for the magnetized plasma .",
    "a long series of observations , experiments and theoretical ( analytical and numerical ) studies has established that the fluids exhibit an intrinsic trend to organisation .",
    "this is most obvious at relaxation from turbulent states when the fluid evolves toward a reduced subset of flow patterns , characterized by regular form of the streamfunction as shown for example by mathaeus _",
    "_ 1991a , matthaeus et al . 1991b ,",
    "et al_. 1995 , horton and hasegawa 1994 ( and references therein ) .",
    "it has been shown ( spineanu and vlad 2005 ) that the stationary states attained at late times in the evolution of the charney - hasegawa - mima ( chm ) fluids are described by the following equation @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the streamfunction and @xmath2 is a positive constant .",
    "this equation has been derived within a field - theoretical formulation of the model of interacting point - like vortices and reveals that the asymptotic state of organization of the physical vorticity in fluids and plasmas is identical to states of self - duality of classical field theory of matter interacting with a gauge field .",
    "consistent with the physical model from which it is derived , this equation should describe the states of fluids / plasmas characterized by the presence of a background of vorticity ( a condensate of vorticity ) and a finite intrinsic length ( or a velocity of propagation of perturbation , like the gravity wave speed or the sonic speed ) .",
    "the numerical solutions of this differential equation has provided interesting results for the physical systems which it should be able to describe : plasma vortices , atmospheric vortices , non - neutral plasma vortex crystals , current sheets .",
    "comparisons with experimental results on navier - stokes fluid , consisting of scatterplots @xmath3 @xmath4 ( streamfunction , vorticity ) ( de rooij et al .",
    "1999 ) , and with the scatterplots obtained in numerical simulations by seyler ( 1995 ) are also favorable . a brief discussion of the derivation of eq.([eq ] ) will be presented in section 2 .    due to the similar analytical structure ( although for largely different magnitude of parameters ) of the plasma vortex and the atmospheric vortex , we expect that this equation leads to solutions that may capture the strong nonlinear character of the atmospheric vortical flows in those states where the stationarity can be assumed a good approximation .",
    "certainly the problem of the structure of the atmospheric vortex can not be reduced in general to only fluid nonlinear dynamics , knowing the very important role of the heat exchange and moisture transport and condensation processes .",
    "these are essential elements of tropical cyclogenesis ( see emanuel 1986 and 1989 and references therein ) but it is often accepted that the fluid dynamics is an adequate framework to study the vortex structure at the late stage of the evolution ( reasor and montgomery 2001 , kossin and schubert 2001 ) . the fluid dynamic nonlinearity becomes the dominant constraint determining the structure of the velocity field when the thermodynamic processes have reached the stationary equilibrium .    the results of a numerical investigation of equation ( [ eq ] ) , for a range of parameters relevant for the physics of the atmosphere , are summarised here .",
    "the monopolar solutions of the differential equation have the same morphology as the two - dimensional flow of a tropical cyclone  ( willoughby and black 1996 , wang and wu 2004 , reasor and montgomery 2001 , kossin and schubert 2001 ) .",
    "the solutions are characterized by a very narrow dip of the profile of the azimuthal velocity ( tangential wind ) in the center of the vortex .",
    "the radius of the `` maximum tangential wind '' or the radius of the _ eye wall _ is much smaller than the radius of the vortex .",
    "there is a decay of the magnitude of the azimuthal velocity toward the periphery , which is much slower compared with the fast decay toward the center .",
    "we find a very low magnitude ( almost vanishing ) of the vorticity over most of the vortex ( approx . from the radius of maximum wind to the periphery ) , while the magnitude in a narrow central region is extremely high .",
    "quantitatively , we obtain for the diameter of the cyclone s eye a magnitude which compares well with the observations .",
    "the maximum vorticity is in a realistic range and the radial profile of the tangential velocity is similar to what is found in observations or with what is obtained in empirical models and numerical simulations .",
    "these favorable comparisons are valid in the case of mature , quasi - stationary tropical cyclones , after the phases of genesis and dynamic intensification .    besides the structure of the flow , the numerical solutions for a very large number of cases provide a large data set from which various correlations can be extracted . in this",
    "regard we are mainly led to look for correlations between parameters that may present interest in practical cases and eventually can be compared with the observations .",
    "the main parameters that have been collected in the numerical work are : total radial extension of the atmospheric vortex , @xmath5 ; the radius where the maximum of the tangential velocity is attained , @xmath6 ; the magnitude of the maximum tangential wind , @xmath7 .",
    "in addition we have collected the total energy @xmath8 and vorticity @xmath9 in the final state flow field .",
    "it is encouraging that we find the linear relationship , @xmath10 which has also been revealed in numerical investigations of a large ensemble of point - like vortices ( yatsuyanagi _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) . the numerical studies carried out until now are organized in the form of several scaling relations connecting vortex characteristics to the few parameters of the eq.([eq ] ) .",
    "they may be used for comparison with observation or with more complex theoretical models .",
    "in addition , the numerical study of eq.([eq ] ) reveals the existence of metastable states ( quasi - solutions ) consisting of ( a ) extremely concentrated vortical flows , similar to the cross section of a tornado and ( b ) collection of vortices with symmetric positions in plane ( vortex crystals ) .",
    "in this section we briefly recall the origin of eq.([eq ] ) .",
    "it is useful to consider first the ideal fluid described by the euler equation , for which it has been shown that it evolves at relaxation toward a very ordered flow pattern , consisting of two ( positive and negative ) vortices .",
    "this state persists for long times , being limitted by only the effect of some residual dissipation . from numerical simulations",
    "it has also been inferred the form of the flow function .",
    "it has been found that the streamfunction @xmath11 obeys , in these states , the _ sinh_-poisson equation , an equation which has very special properties .",
    "it is an exactly integrable equation ( by inverse scattering transform ) and is connected with a wide class of fundamental systems , like the thirring lattice of spins in plane , the affine toda system , the gauss - codazzi equations for embedding a surface in three dimensional space , etc .",
    "david montgomery and his collaborators have developed a theoretical statistical model which explains the presence of this equation in this context ( kraichnan and montgomery 1980 , fyfe , montgomery and joyce 1976 , joyce and montgomery 1973 , montgomery and joyce 1974 , montgomery _ et al_. 1992 ) .",
    "the euler equation is @xmath12   \\mathbf{\\omega } = 0   \\label{euler}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the versor perpendicular on the plane , the velocity and the vorticity are respectively @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it is generally accepted ( but not yet mathematically proved ) that the euler fluid may be described by an equivalent model , consisting of a set of discrete point - like vortices moving in plane under the effect of mutual interaction .",
    "the latter is expressed by a potential given by the natural logarithm of the relative distance between vortices normalized to the linear extension of the region in plane where the motion is bounded ( kraichnan and montgomery 1980 ) .",
    "a fundamental observation is that this formulation exhibits a particular structure : matter , field , interaction .",
    "the _ matter _ corresponds to the density of point - like vortices in plane ; the _ field _ is derived from the potantial and can be seen as an independent component of the system ; the _ interaction _ appears as the usual combination of the matter current with the potential and leads to the equation of motion of the point - like vortices .",
    "the _ sinh_-poisson equation has been derived by formulating the continuum version of the point - like vortices model as a field theoretical model of interacting gauge and matter fields in the adjoint representation of @xmath16 ( spineanu and vlad 2003 ) .",
    "the essential point of the latter derivation was the self - duality of the relaxation states of the fluid .    in its simplest form",
    "the charney - hasegawa - mima equation is @xmath17 \\mathbf{\\nabla }",
    "_ { \\perp } ^{2}\\psi = 0   \\label{chm}\\ ] ] similar to the euler equation there is a discrete vortex model for the charney - hasegawa - mima equation , where the potential of interaction is now short range ( the modified bessel function of zero order ) , _ i.e. _ it decays on the range given by the intrinsic length of the chm equation .",
    "this model has been used in meteorology by morikawa ( morikawa 1960 ) and stewart ( stewart 1943 ) .    in a similar approach as for the euler fluid , it has been developed ( spineanu and vlad 2005 ) a field theoretical model for the continuous version of the point - like vortices with short range interaction , based on the chern - simons action for the gauge field in interaction with the nonlinear matter field , in the adjoint representation of the @xmath18 algebra . in this model",
    "it is possible to derive the energy as a functional that becomes extremum on a subset of stationary states and presents particular properties .",
    "the general characterization of this family of states is their _ self - duality _ , which here means that the energy functional becomes minimum when the squared terms in its expression are all vanishing , leaving as lower bound for energy a quantity with topological meaning , proportional with the total vorticity .",
    "the result is a set of equations parametrized by the solutions of the laplace equation in two - dimensions .",
    "the eq.([eq ] ) is the simplest of this family .",
    "to solve eq.([eq ] ) we use the code `` giant a software package for the numerical solution of very large systems of highly nonlinear systems '' written by u. nowak and l. weimann ( nowak and weiman 1990 ) .",
    "the code is part of the numerical software library _ codelib _ of the konrad zuse zentrum fur informationstechnik berlin .",
    "the meaning of the abbreviation is : giant = global inexact affine invariant newton techniques .",
    "this code solves nonlinear problems @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a nonlinear partial differential operator .",
    "the presence of the hyperbolic trigonometric functions , with very fast variation with the argument , renders the equation difficult to solve and many initial conditions do not lead to a solution since they can not initiate a converging iteration . with all the difficulties of finding a right initialization of the integration procedure we note however that the solution with the morphology of a tropical cyclone appears insistently from a wide class of initial functions which contains vortical flows .",
    "eq.([eq ] ) has been derived from the _ self - duality _ subset of the euler - lagrange variational equations for the action functional of the field - theoretical model . in this action",
    "there are only two physical parameters : the coefficient of the chern - simons action , which we have identified as the sound speed , @xmath21 and the asymptotic vorticity which is the coriolis frequency @xmath22 ( or , in plasma physics , the ion cyclotron frequency @xmath23 ) .",
    "the space - like parameter that normalizes the laplace operator in the eq.([eq ] ) is the ratio @xmath24__i.e .",
    "_ _ the rossby radius @xmath25 ( respectively the sonic larmor radius in plasma , @xmath26 ) . all distances implied in the solution are normalized to @xmath25 .",
    "the streamfunction is normalised as @xmath27the unit for the streamfunction is @xmath28 and the unit for vorticity @xmath22 .",
    "then the unit for velocity is @xmath29 . here and in the rest of the paper the upperscript _",
    "phys _ is used to indicate that the quantity is dimensional , measured in appropriate physical units .",
    "however the units themselves ( _ i.e. _ @xmath25 , @xmath22 and combinations ) are written without this upperscript since there can be no confusion .",
    "if we know the large radial extension of a vortex ( @xmath30 ) the normalized parameter @xmath5 is obtained by dividing to @xmath25 .",
    "the result of integration is very sensitive to @xmath5 and this points out the essential role played by @xmath25 in numerical studies aiming to reproduce observations . when the depth of the atmospheric perturbation is @xmath31 , the rossby radius is @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the gravitational acceleration ) .",
    "actually @xmath25 is influenced by several other parameters than @xmath31 , in particular the vorticity and it can have a range from tens to thousand kilometers . when combined with the range of vortex extensions @xmath30 , it results that @xmath5 has a range between a fraction of unity to few units ( in plasma @xmath5 can be hundreads to thousands ) . for mature",
    "stationary cyclones the radial extension of the cyclon vortex and the rossby radius are of similar magnitude and this means that we have to study the range @xmath34 .    the domain of integration is a square with a side of length @xmath35 @xmath36 \\times \\left [ -l , l\\right ] \\label{domain}\\ ] ] on which we place a rectangular mesh @xmath37 usually with @xmath38 .",
    "we impose dirichlet boundary conditions _",
    "i.e. _ the streamfunction is a constant , @xmath39 on the limits of the square of integration . here",
    "@xmath40 is the smaller root of the equation @xmath41 and since in all our runs we have @xmath42 , the condition is @xmath43 .",
    "this means zero vorticity at the boundary but it has defavorable effect on the velocity field , which does not allways vanish at the border .    in general the initial profiles have been of various types : ( a ) symmetric profiles ( _ e.g. _ gaussian functions , or various annular shapes ) with maximum centered on @xmath44 , or the petviashvili - pokhotelov vortex , eq.([petv ] ) below ; ( b ) functions expressed as product of trigonometric functions ; or ( c ) collections of localised vortex - like perturbations placed randomly . in this work",
    "we report results obtained for initializations with vorticity of the same sign over all the space region .",
    "it resulted that the monopolar vortex which may be relevant for the atmosphere physics can actually be obtained as a solution of the convergent iteration from a large class of initial conditions , of various shapes belonging to the three classes mentioned above .",
    "however , in terms of a set of parameters describing any of the classes of initialization , finding the convergence ( solution ) proves to be complicated and finding a solution is rather exceptional .",
    "it can be said that the regions favorable to convergence in the space of initial function are intricate and have sharp limits .    in order to simulate the formation of a vortex the main series of runs reported here have adopted as initial function (",
    "from which the iteration of giant starts ) a monopolar , circularly symmetric form characterized by few parameters , the petviashvili - pokhotelov vortex @xmath45 ^{4/3}+\\psi _ { b}.   \\label{petv}\\ ] ] here @xmath46 , @xmath47 may be seen as a peaking factor of the initial shape , @xmath48 is the amplitude and @xmath39 is the boundary value .",
    "the reason to choose the form ( petv ) is connected with the set of equation ( continuity and conservation of momentum ) from which the chm equation is originally derived .",
    "it has been shown by a multiple space - time scale analysis that the late stage evolution of the full set of equation is dominated by mesoscopic scales ( of the order @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a typical length of the gradient of the equilibrium density ) where a different nonlinear mechanism is present . instead of the nonlinearity term in ( [ chm ] )",
    "there is a scalar or korteweg - devries nonlinearity of the type @xmath51 in one dimension , and the equation actually is replaced by the flierl - petviashvili equation ( see for example spineanu et al . 2004 ) . or",
    ", this equation has a solution expressed as eq.([petv ] ) . as initial function , eq.([petv ] )",
    "has some advantages : it has physical relevance for the system which is behind the stationary states emerging from eq.([chm ] ) ; it is a vortical structure , as those which may be expected to form spontaneously in real situations ; and it has few parameters which we take as coordinates in a space of initial functions that must be sampled to find solutions .",
    "the parameters of the equation and of the initial function , which completely defines a numerical experiment , are : ( a ) half the length of the side of the square area taken as region of integration , @xmath52 ; ( b ) the constant of the equation which in these runs is taken @xmath42 .",
    "this implies that the boundary condition for the streamfunction , which also means zero vorticity , is @xmath53 ; ( c ) the peaking on the center , described by @xmath47 ; ( d ) the amplitude of the initial function @xmath48 .",
    "the choice of an initial amplitude @xmath48 favorable for reaching a solution is made easier if we use the following formula connecting the radius of the maximum azimuthal velocity @xmath54 with the amplitude of the streamfunction at this maximum @xmath48 : @xmath55 this formula can be derived by simple manipulations of the equation ( [ eq ] ) , together with approximations that are made possible by some numerical experience about the orders of magnitude of the normalized quantities .",
    "it is a rather poor but useful approximation and only works for @xmath56 , a range which is interesting for the atmospheric vortex .    from the other types of initial profiles we briefly discuss the second one .",
    "as suggested by the numerical study of the _ sinh_-poisson equation the initial function has been taken in several runs as a product of trigonometric functions in both directions , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . to have a good initialization",
    ", we choose a point @xmath59 where the initial function is maximum .",
    "the equation imposes a condition on only the amplitude @xmath60 of the trigonometric functions of period @xmath61 , @xmath62 \\simeq \\frac{1% } { 2}\\sinh \\psi _ { 0}\\left ( \\cosh \\psi _ { 0}-1\\right )   \\label{guess}\\ ] ] the equation is solved graphically and one of the roots is selected as the amplitude of the initial function . from these initializations",
    "we obtain sometimes quasi - solutions consisting of multiple vortices .      when the integration with giant identifies a monopolar , circularly symmetric solution ( usually with the precision @xmath63 ) the shape is still influenced by the square geometry of the domain of integration ( [ domain ] ) and by the boundary condition @xmath43 .",
    "the velocity is usually not zero on the boundaries and this means that we have a too approximative value for the total energy ( this is not the case with the vorticity field and with the energy and vorticity for the strongly localized vortices ) . in these cases",
    "we can make a one dimensional ( radial ) integration @xmath64with @xmath65 at @xmath66 . since the square and radial problem have different boundary conditions the mapping between the solutions obtained in square and in radial integrations requires certain care .",
    "we have found that the general rule @xmath67establishes a good correspondence between the square solutions and the radial solutions .",
    "this simply means that the solution on a square with half side @xmath68 are very close to the radial solution with extension @xmath69 equal to half the diagonal of the square .",
    "this is shown by the table 1 where we compare the important quantities : @xmath70 ( the radius where the maximum tangential velocity is attained ) and @xmath7 ( the maximum tangential velocity ) , obtained in square ( sq ) and respectively radial ( rad ) integrations .",
    "these quantities are also compared in figures 1a and 1b .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for radial integrations we use _ bvplsq _ ( boundary value problem least square solvers for highly nonlinear equations ) , written by p. deulfhard and g. bader .",
    "the code is a part of the _ codelib _ library of fortran codes supported by konrad zuse zentrum fuer informationtechnik berlin ( zib ) ( see the prolog of bvplsq at the _ codelib _ web site ) .",
    "although is more efficient than _ mulcon _ ( also from _ codelib _ ) or the nag subroutine _ d02gaf _ , we have noted that the radial integration has a weaker ability of identification of the solution compared with the two - dimensional ( square ) one , giant .",
    "the solution is obtained at a lower accuracy which we quantify by defining a functional @xmath71@xmath72 ^{2 }   \\label{error}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the vorticity and @xmath74 is the nonlinear term in eq.(eq ) .",
    "this is shown in a column of the table .     and ( b ) @xmath75 , title=\"fig:\",width=188 ] and ( b ) @xmath75 , title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]    a massive series of ( automatic ) radial integrations has been performed , since they are faster than giant . both solutions and quasi - solutions",
    "are obtained and it is confirmed that the very precise results of the square integrations ( giant ) are points on a line of minimum error ( [ error ] ) .",
    "they will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the strong nonlinear character of eq.([eq ] ) combined with the internal procedures of giant ( with no physical significance ) imprints a particular structure to a space of functions that is explored for exact solutions .",
    "the space of functions representing initial conditions are divided into disjoint parts , such that from one subset one can not access the final configuration of another subset .",
    "this means that in order to obtain a particular type of stationary ( asymptotic ) solution one has to initialize in a particular subset , homotopically connected to the final state .",
    "most of the initial conditions does not lead to convergence and possibly they correspond to turbulent physical states .",
    "exact solutions are obtained in the form of trivial ( @xmath76 ) state and monopolar or multipolar vortices .",
    "besides exact solutions there are sets of functions that are almost solutions , _ i.e. _ velocity field configurations that verify the equation with only low accuracy and are normally rejected by the integration procedure at smaller tolerance .",
    "they are interesting because they appear systematically and approximately exhibit the same characteristics for a fixed @xmath77 .",
    "the iteration of giant gets almost stuck around such a solution , which may suggest that they are metastable states of the physical fluid and eventually evolve slowly toward an exact solution , a smooth vortex .",
    "we call them quasi - solutions and we find useful to include them in our discussion .",
    "the main reason for accepting them as interesting and possibly physically relevant structures resides in the particularity of our approach : the fundamental object is the action functional and the configurations described by eq.([eq ] ) extremize this action .",
    "if , by indifferently what method ( here numerical ) , it has been possible to identify a configuration that seems to be very close to the extremum of the action ( possibly a local minimum in the function space ) then this configuration may play a role in the system s evolution . although a more detailed description of the structure of the function space around the extrema of the action is still required , the highly concentrated vortices identified numerically seem to be close of extremizing the action functional .",
    "restricting to the case of monopolar vortices we summarize the results by saying that for every @xmath77 we obtain two types of final vortices :    1 .   smooth , finite amplitude , vortices verifying the equation for any change in the accuracy of the integration procedure .",
    "there is a unique smooth vortex configuration for each @xmath77 .",
    "quasi - solutions , consisting of strongly localised vortices , with profiles for velocity and vorticity that are much narrower compared with the smooth vortices .",
    "these quasi - solutions are persistently obtained and they exhibit a clusterization around a typical shape for a particular @xmath77 .",
    "we are focusing here on the type of solutions that exhibit strong similarities with the morphology of a horizontal cross section of a tropical cyclone .",
    "these are circularly symmetric solutions with a strong maximum of the tangential velocity , strong concentration of vorticity .",
    "we consider for ilustration the smooth , circularly symmetric vortex obtained for @xmath78 .",
    "fig.[fig_2 ] presents a section of the streamfunction @xmath79 along the diagonal of the domain @xmath59 .",
    "a section of the vorticity @xmath80 is presented in fig.fig_3 .     along the diagonal of the square , for the smooth vortex at @xmath78.,height=188 ]     obtained by integration.,height=188 ]    in order to quantify the accuracy of integration we collect in all the domain @xmath59 the pairs @xmath81 and plot them together with the line representing the nonlinear term in eq.(eq ) , fig.[fig_4 ] .",
    "the scatterplot of @xmath81 is almost superposed on this line .",
    "the scatterplot of the pairs [ @xmath73 , @xmath82 ( not shown ) indicates a close clustering around the diagonal .",
    "other tests are possible and they show that the integration is very good on most of the region and good within the imposed accuracy in the regions where the second derivative is very high .    , for the smooth vortex at @xmath78.,height=188 ]",
    "the tangential component of the velocity is shown in fig.[fig_5 ] .",
    "the steep descent to the center is clearly visible and its radial extension can be compared with the extension of the whole domain .",

    "for this example ( @xmath78 ) is in a ratio @xmath83 and integrated over a circle shows no net inflow to the axis .",
    "the large amount of results for the range of @xmath77 : @xmath84 , allows to formulate two remarks .",
    "first we note that for larger @xmath77 the profile of the azimuthal velocity shows smaller amplitude and larger radius of the circle of maximum velocity .",
    "second , this variation with @xmath77 is much faster for low @xmath85 ( less or comparable to @xmath86 ) .",
    "the differences in the quantitative characteristics of the vortices for even small variation of @xmath77 in this range are substantial .",
    "below we provide a scaling which shows exponential behavior , eq.([vthmaxl ] ) .",
    "for comparison we present the profiles of the solution @xmath11 fig.[fig_7 ] , vorticity @xmath80 fig.fig_8 and azimuthal velocity @xmath87 fig.fig_9 for the quasi - solution that correspnds to the same @xmath78 .",
    "the sections are along the diagonal , denoted @xmath88 .",
    "the results for every @xmath77 s seem to indicate a clusterization of the final total energy and final total vorticity .",
    "one should note that the total vorticity ( obtained by integrating over the square ) is however smaller than that for the corresponding smooth vortex shown in the preceding figures .",
    "the total energy @xmath89 $ ] for a fluid density @xmath90 , is larger for the concentrated vortices compared to the smooth ones .",
    "there are episodic structures of multiple vortices that are detected as solutions under a certain precision and which however evlove to symmetric monopolar vortex when the system is allowed to run further , under a higher precision .",
    "it is worth to mention that in a numerical experiment we have identified a state where two vortices have been formed , placed in symmetrical positions along the diagonal of the square domain @xmath91 .",
    "the initial function is trigonometric with periodicity @xmath92 with a coefficient @xmath93 . examining this structure with higher precision , after a longer iteration sequence the final solution was again the centered smooth vortex known for @xmath94 .",
    "therefore from the point of view of the numerical experience this state of two vortices is irrelevant .",
    "however , the persistence of this state inside the iterative search may indicate that it is close to a solution , possible less structurally stable .",
    "four vortices have been obtained in a run starting from trigonometric initial function .",
    "the initial function is trigonometric with periodicity @xmath95 .",
    "the results show the formation of four vortices , as shown by fig.fig_10 .",
    "each of them has a structure that is similar to the one presented in fig.[fig_2 ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that again the vorticity is almost zero everywhere on the domain , except the regions of the four vortices , where it reaches very high values .",
    "the local tangential velocity presents the same very fast decay to the center of the vortex and each vortex is similar in structure with a typical cyclone .     for a four - vortices solution.,height=264 ]     and the vector field @xmath96 for a four - vortices solution.,height=264 ]",
    "as mentioned before the nontrivial results of monopolar vortices are systematically of two types : a smooth vortex solution and a strongly localised quasi - solution .",
    "these are always the same for a fixed @xmath77 .",
    "their characteristics strongly depends on @xmath77 , especially for the lower part of the range , where @xmath77 is few units or less .    since the monopolar final states are independent of the initial conditions from which we start and of the particular numerical method of solution ( giant ) the relationships between the characteristics of the final vortices are objective and reflect properties of the equation itself .",
    "in addition the results ( smooth vortex and narrow quasi - solution ) are unique for a particular @xmath77 , suggesting we can collect all numerical results in a form of nomograms or analytic ( eventually spline functions ) fit .",
    "however , we will look instead for analytic formulas which , even approximative , are simpler to use .",
    "we examine ( a ) the scaling of the _ maximum tangential velocity _ with the radius of the vortex , @xmath97 ; ( b ) the scaling of the _ radius of the eye - wall _ of the atmospheric vortex with the length @xmath77 .",
    "finally we will examine the existence of a linear relation between__the energy _ _ and _ _ the vorticty__in the final states .",
    "we have inferred from numerical data an expression showing variation of @xmath98 with the radial extension of the vortex @xmath5",

    "( this is inspired by the picture taken by nasa on the hurricane rita , september 21 , 2005 ) . from this data",
    "it is obtained @xmath198 then we can calculate the rossby radius @xmath199 .",
    "taking the coriolis parameter @xmath200 we have the physical unit of velocity @xmath201 . the maximum tangential velocity for @xmath202",
    "can be calculated using the scaling formula eq.([vthmaxl ] ) , with the result @xmath203 .",
    "we will use however the exact result , provided by numerical integration with giant of eq.([eq ] ) , @xmath204 and this leads to the physical velocity @xmath205 the maximum vorticity is @xmath206 .",
    "these examples confirm the possibility of using the scaling relationships eq.([vthmaxl ] ) and eq.([eyefit2 ] ) to estimate the physical charactersistics of the tropical cyclone .",
    "we note that the results of the estimations can be significantly affected by the approximations on the observational data , especially that of the ratio @xmath207 .",
    "this is because the magnitude of @xmath77 which is obtained from eq.([eyefit2 ] ) using a reasonable input value for this ratio belongs to a range where the variations with @xmath77 of all the characteristics of the solution ( @xmath1 , @xmath73 , @xmath208 , @xmath6 ) are substantial .",
    "it is sufficient to look at the dependence of @xmath209 on @xmath77 , fig.[fig_11 ] .",
    "at the origin of our approach it is the charney - hasegawa - mima model , a two - dimensional , nondissipative and purely fluid - dynamical ( no thermal process ) model .",
    "although is a simplified model it exhibits ( via the field - theoretical formulation ) a compact analytic and algebraic structure , self - duality , leading to eq.([eq ] ) .",
    "we have several arguments in favor of the conclusion that eq.([eq ] ) may represent the fluid nonlinear - dynamic part of the atmospheric vortex .",
    "first , the profiles obtained by solving eq.([eq ] ) are similar to results already known ( from observations or numerical simulation ) for the same quantities .    1 .",
    "the profile of the the tangential velocity , our fig.[fig_5 ] , is similar to typical tropical cyclone velocity profiles , as represented in fig.2 of wang and wu 2004 .",
    "this is also confirmed by close similarity with the fig.1a from reasor and montgomery 2001 and with the profile given by the holland model or with the experimental observation ( for andrew hurricane , willoughby and black 1996 ) .",
    "the fast decay to zero of the vorticity @xmath73 shown in our fig.fig_2 is similar to what is shown in fig.1a of kossin and schubert 2001 ; ideally ( without dissipation and friction ) for mature hurricanes the maximum of @xmath73 is on the center .",
    "we note that in  a series of reported numerical simulations , the tendency of the fields is to evolve toward profiles that are very close to those shown in our figures [ fig_2 ] and [ fig_5 ] .",
    "for example , the fig.7a and 7b of kossin and schubert 2001 show the evolution of the vorticity and mean of the tangential velocity from initial profiles which correspond to a narrow ring of vorticity to profiles that show clear ressemblance with our figures [ fig_2 ] and [ fig_5 ] . the same striking evolution to profiles similar to ours appears in figs.7 a and b of the same reference .",
    "we have investigated whether a radially annular profile of vorticity can be a solution of our equation ( [ eq ] ) .",
    "the result is negative , which may explain why such an initial profile evolves to either a set of vortices ( vortex - crystal ) or to a centrally peaked structure as in fig.[fig_2 ] .      finally , the quasi - solutions which appear to be an interesting feature of this equation , are compatible with a series of previously known results : the four vortices represented in our figure [ fig_10 ] are similar to the figure 4a from the work of kossin and schubert 2001 . and the evolution to a monopolar structure we obtain is similar to the same process reported in this reference .    the numerical results have made possible to formulate several scaling relationships connecting parameters of the atmospheric vortex .",
    "these are simple formulas , intended for practical use , inevitably approximative .",
    "this is because our purpose was to infer an analytical expression for a curve which is determined numerically ( or : is known in the form of a simple table of values ) .",
    "other expressions are possible and are worth to look for .",
    "a true scaling law will become possible only as a result of an _ analytical _ investigation of the properties of the equation . on the other hand",
    ", this equation does not have a backlund transform and is probable not integrable by the inverse scattering transform .",
    "an important field of future investigation ( analytical and numerical ) is represented by the _ quasi - solutions _ , elements of a space of functions that are very close of verifying the equation .",
    "are they close to the extremum of the action functional of the full field - theoretical model , for example , are they metastable states ? from the physical point of view it may result that these states can be rendered more stable by processes that are connected with what is missing from the charney - hasegawa - mima model : third dimension , viscosity , thermal processes .",
    "it is worth to examine the role of the strongly localized quasi - solutions in models of tornadoes",
    ".    an interesting suggestion results from the massive series of radial integrations : it appears that in the space of functions there are strings of vortical quasi - solutions emanating from the exact solution and showing increasing degree of departure from exactness ( increase of the @xmath210 functional ) .",
    "if some physical factor will provide stability to these quasi - solutions , then the system may slide along this string , with the consequence that there is no pure stationarity but a continuous evolution to stronger and stronger localisation of the vortex .",
    "this requires further study .",
    "developing from the present one , a future self - consistent model will have to include variation of the rossby radius with the dynamical properties of the vortex . since this implies to consider that the coefficient of the chern - simons part in the lagrangian is a nonlinear function of the scalar field , it is difficult to say if the self - duality will be maintained .",
