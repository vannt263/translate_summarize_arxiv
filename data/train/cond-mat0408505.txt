    "the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect shows the importance of the electromagnetic gauge field in quantum mechanics and the fact that a single electron has a fundamental unit of magnetic flux @xmath0 ( units for which @xmath1 are used here ) .",
    "one direct consequence of the ab effect in solid state physics is persistent currents  @xcite .",
    "persistent currents are driven by an external gauge field produced when a magnetic flux penetrates a hollow area of a system .",
    "the external gauge field breaks the time - reversal symmetry and can induce equilibrium persistent currents in the ground state . in a previous study  @xcite , a twist - induced gauge field was proposed that also affects persistent currents but still preserves the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "this gauge field is useful in analyzing persistent currents in toroidal carbon nanotubes as well as in other systems  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of lattice deformation in carbon nanotubes on conducting electrons was studied , and it was found that electrons near the fermi level are affected by a gauge field produced by the deformation  @xcite ( called the `` deformation - induced gauge field '' ) . because a deformation depends on position , the deformation - induced gauge field is also position dependent .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that the twist - induced gauge field corresponds to a constant part of the deformation - induced gauge field , meaning that a local extension of the twist - induced gauge field appears naturally in the low energy dynamics of conducting electrons in a deformed carbon nanotube .",
    "the gauge field presented here provides a unified way of examining the effect of local lattice deformation in carbon nanotubes on the local energy gap . at the conclusion of this paper ,",
    "some problems associated with the above - mentioned gauge field are discussed .",
    "in this section , the basic ideas used to describe the quantum mechanical behavior of conducting electrons in carbon nanotubes  @xcite are explained .",
    "these ideas underlie the work presented in subsequent sections .",
    "a carbon nanotube is a graphene sheet folded into a cylinder , and graphene consists of many hexagons ( in a honeycomb lattice ) whose vertices are occupied by carbon atoms .",
    "each carbon atom supplies one conducting electron that determines the electrical property of the carbon nanotube .",
    "the graphene lattice structure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] .",
    "there are two symmetry translational vectors ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 satisfying @xmath4 ) on the planar honeycomb lattice .",
    "the lattice structure of a carbon nanotube can be specified by two mutually perpendicular vectors , the chiral @xmath5 and the translational @xmath6 , defined respectively by @xmath7 and @xmath8 . here , @xmath5 fixes the lattice structure around the axis and",
    "is denoted simply by @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding wave vector @xmath10 can be decomposed as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are integer coefficients of vectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 satisfying the periodic boundary conditions @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "thus , @xmath5 and @xmath6 specify the _",
    "kinematics _ of the electron .",
    "a nontrivial property of a single electron wave function in a honeycomb lattice is that the wave function has two components .",
    "this is because two sites exist in the unit cell , depicted as circles that are black ( a - site ) or white ( b - site ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] .",
    "the two - component wave function is written as @xmath20 it is noted that this two - component nature does not relate to electron spin .",
    "however , there is a ( theoretical ) similarity between them such that the two - component nature is sometimes referred to as a `` pseudo - spin . '' for example , when an electron takes a turn ( around the fermi point ) in k - space through the impurity scattering , the wave function of the electron takes the ( berry ) phase shift of @xmath21 resulting in an absence of back scattering  @xcite .",
    "the sign change of the wave function is similar to that of spin rotation in space .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system ( _ dynamics _ ) is thus given as a @xmath22 hermite matrix .",
    "we consider a general form of the hamiltonian : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the probability amplitude from an a - site to the same site , and @xmath25 is that from an a - site to the nearest b - site .",
    "we assume the nearest - neighbor tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath26 , with hopping integral @xmath27 , given by @xmath28 where a denotes an a - sublattice , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are canonical annihilation - creation operators of the electron at site @xmath31 satisfying the anticommutation relation @xmath32 , and site @xmath33 indicates nearest - neighbor sites ( @xmath34 ) of site @xmath31 .",
    "here , @xmath24 and @xmath35 are neglected because they are assumed to be equivalent and to have a constant value , meaning that they do not affect the energy spectrum but only shift the origin of the energy . by means of the bloch theorem",
    ", we obtain @xmath36 . here , @xmath37 ( @xmath34 ) are vectors pointing to the nearest neighbor of an a - site ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] ) . by diagonalizing the hamiltonian",
    ", we obtain the energy eigenvalue as a function of @xmath10 as @xmath38 , where the negative sign indicates the valence energy band , and the positive sign denotes the conduction band .",
    "it is crucial to know that there are two positions in k - space where @xmath39 vanishes .",
    "they are located at @xmath40 where @xmath41 and called the k and k points . here , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are reciprocal lattice vectors of the graphene defined by @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .    in the following , metallic or semiconducting behavior",
    "dependent on the lattice structure around axis @xmath5 as exhibited by the carbon nanotube is shown . assuming a nanotube with long length , that is @xmath46 , then lines can be drawn in k - space indicating that the energy eigenstates are located on the lines ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : motion ] ) .",
    "the energy gap of the system is determined by the configuration of the line located nearest to the fermi points . here , the electrons in the lines ( the energy bands of the lines ) are called `` low - energy electrons '' ( low energy modes ) . when the line cross the k - point ,",
    "the system exhibits metallic properties and otherwise semiconducting properties .",
    "this is because the conduction band and valence band touch only at the k and k points .",
    "it is important to mention that low energy electrons around the fermi points generally rotate around the axis as opposed to a naive consideration .",
    "it is incorrect to think that low energy electrons should always have non - rotating modes or that the wave function around the axis is constant .",
    "the motion of low energy electrons around the axis depends on the lattice structure around the axis .",
    "one can verify the relationship between the chiral vector and the motion of low energy electrons in table i of reference  @xcite .",
    "nanotubes correspond to the horizontal axis in k - space ; therefore , the low energy electrons are always classified as non - rotating states . ]",
    "in the previous section we explained why nanotubes can show either metallic or semiconducting behavior , one of the most remarkable properties of nanotubes .",
    "this is due to ( 1 ) the periodic boundary condition _ around _ the axis and ( 2 ) the energy dispersion relation of graphene ( there are two fermi points ) .",
    "because the periodic boundary condition around the axis strongly affects the energy band structure , it would be interesting to consider how the solid state properties of a nanotube depend on the boundary condition _ along _ the axis .",
    "if the two ends of a nanotube are connected , the boundary condition along the axis becomes periodic .",
    "the resultant geometry , a torus , possesses an important structural degree of freedom called `` twist ''  @xcite .",
    "twist can mix the motions _ along _ and _ around _ the axis , and is thus expected to affect the solid state properties . in section  [ sec :",
    "pc ] , the kinematics of persistent current in a twisted carbon torus are reported , and it is shown that current exhibits the special character of tubule geometry . it is noted that persistent currents in a twisted torus can be well described by the notion of a twist - induced gauge field  @xcite . except for the kinematics ,",
    "the effect of a lattice deformation on the low - energy modes is crucial for understanding nanotube physics . in section  [ sec : def ] , the effect of lattice deformation on the energy gap is examined in terms of a deformation - induced gauge field  @xcite . throughout this section , the strong interplay between ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) has been emphasized , and it has been remarked that both twist- and deformation - induced gauge fields maintain the time - reversal symmetry of the system .      in this section , persistent currents in toroidal carbon nanotubes are examined . because the effect of twist on persistent currents is of interest , the difference between persistent currents in an untwisted torus and that in a twisted torus is important .",
    "moreover , it is not necessary to consider all of the electrons in the system .",
    "an examination of low - energy electrons is sufficient because the persistent currents relate to the energy spectrum flow at the fermi level . here ,",
    "the lattice structure of an untwisted carbon nanotorus is specified initially , then a twisted nanotorus is considered .",
    "the kinematics for an untwisted torus are considered first .",
    "the wave vector of the low energy modes is given by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) indicates clockwise ( counterclockwise ) rotation around the axis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : motion](b ) .",
    "because of the periodic boundary condition along the axis , we have @xmath50 .",
    "next , the kinematics for a twisted carbon torus are considered .",
    "a specific type of torus , obtained by twisting an untwisted torus ( a - type  @xcite ) , is used for simplicity . to express a twist degree of freedom ,",
    "the translational vector is replaced as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are integers .",
    "here , @xmath52 denotes the twist and @xmath53 is the greatest common divisor of the two integers @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the wave vector of the low energy modes in the twisted torus is denoted by @xmath56 and should satisfy the following periodic boundary conditions : @xmath57 to understand the effect of twist , we consider the inner product between @xmath56 and @xmath6 as @xmath58 the twist shifts the wave vector in k - space and depends on the electron motion around the axis specified by @xmath59 .",
    "it is important to note that the effect of twist can be provided by a gauge field for an untwisted torus .",
    "therefore , the kinematics of a twisted torus are equivalent to that of an untwisted torus in the presence of a twist - induced gauge field , @xmath60 , satisfying @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "it is also important to mention that the twist - induced gauge field does not break the time - reversal symmetry , contrary to the electromagnetic gauge field @xmath63 .",
    "this is because @xmath63 shifts the wave vector in one direction and depends not on electron motion but on electron charge @xmath64 .",
    "the electromagnetic gauge field leads to the gauge coupling given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the magnetic flux penetrating the torus and @xmath67 is the fundamental unit of magnetic flux .    just as persistent current",
    "is induced by magnetic flux @xmath68 or @xmath69 , the twist - induced gauge field @xmath70 also affects persistent current .",
    "sawtooth curves for the k - point and k-point persistent currents are shifted in different directions by @xmath70 because of the @xmath71 sign in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t - wave - shift ] ) .",
    "suppose the persistent current in an untwisted torus is given by the usual sawtooth curve as a function of @xmath72 . in this case , persistent currents of the k - point and k-point are equal , and the amplitude of total current is twice that of the k - point only ( fig .",
    "[ fig : twist - pc](a ) ) . the twist shifts the curves in the positive and negative directions depending on electron motion around the axis as shown in fig .",

    "we consider the effect of a lattice deformation on the low energy modes .",
    "the hamiltonian of an undeformed tube can be decomposed into two parts at low energy as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) defines the effective dynamics for the k - point ( k-point ) and the corresponding schrdinger equation is given by the weyl equation  @xcite . here",
    ", the fermi velocity is denoted by @xmath77 , @xmath78 are the pauli matrices and @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "it is noted that @xmath81 is the momentum measured from the k - point or k-point .",
    "a lattice deformation can be included by adding the deformed hamiltonian @xmath82 to @xmath26 as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a modulation of the hopping amplitude from @xmath85 to @xmath86 , induced by the deformation .",
    "the leading order of the total hamiltonian , @xmath87 , can be expressed at low energy by @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , @xmath91 is the vector field defined on the surface and @xmath92 is given by a linear function of @xmath93 .",
    "it is noted that the deformation can be included as a gauge field because of the gauge coupling @xmath94 .",
    "here , @xmath91 is called the deformation - induced gauge field , and it does not break the time - reversal symmetry because the sign in front of @xmath91 is different for the k and k points .",
    "it is also important to note that this sign characteristic is equivalent to @xmath70 , but in this case @xmath91 can be position dependent .",
    "the effect of @xmath91 on the energy gap is now considered . for this purpose , @xmath95 is considered in the presence of the electromagnetic gauge field  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath96 , which indicates that the low energy electrons around the k - point are affected by the gauge field of @xmath97 .",
    "the magnetic flux parallel to the tube axis is given by the sum of a ( true ) magnetic flux @xmath98 and a magnetic flux produced by the deformation - induced gauge field @xmath99 as @xmath100 , shifting the wave vector through the ab effect .",
    "this shift corresponds to the fact that the lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : motion](a ) also shift , resulting in a change of the energy gap  @xcite .",
    "the important point here is that the change depends on the axis position @xmath101 , because the flux is a function of @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , the energy gap modulates along the axis .",
    "the energy gap modulation can be estimated by @xmath102 it is important to note that a magnetic field appears when the energy gap is locally modulated .",
    "this magnetic field , perpendicular to the tube surface , can be defined by @xmath103 .",
    "in fact , we have @xmath104 .",
    "a deformed ( by @xmath105 ) nanotube and the corresponding local modulation of energy gap are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : field ] .",
    "( d ) the corresponding local energy gap .",
    "it is noted that this is not the usual electromagnetic field ( @xmath106 ) . ]",
    "it has been assumed thus far that the deformation does not mix the k and k points .",
    "a short - distance lattice deformation , or topological defects such as a pentagon or heptagon , can mix them  @xcite such that the deformation - induced gauge field should be generalized .",
    "a non - abelian extension of the @xmath91 field can successfully include these kinds of deformations  @xcite .",
    "the following sections discuss several problems not yet solved but which seem to be interesting subjects .",
    "an interesting theoretical issue is the need to understand persistent currents in toroidal carbon nanotubes in more detail .",
    "there are several theoretical models for toroidal shapes composed of carbon atoms , classified into three groups : ( t1 ) a small torus consisting of about hundred carbon atoms  @xcite , ( t2 ) a torus with a large aspect ratio in the presence of pentagon - heptagon pairs in the tube surface , and ( t3 ) a torus with a large aspect ratio in the absence of pentagon - heptagon pairs . a simple ( t3 ) torus is considered here .",
    "however , even for ( t3 ) , a theoretical study of persistent currents in the presence of a lattice deformation is not complete .",
    "another interesting issue is clarification of the effects of topological defects on persistent currents ( t2 ) .",
    "this section discusses the applicability of the local energy gap formula .",
    "because it is meant for non - mixing cases , it can not be used in its present form to estimate the local energy gap near topological defects .",
    "for example , there may be a closed cap structure containing pentagons at the edge of a tube for which the local energy gap should be considered in the framework of the non - abelian deformation - induced gauge field  @xcite . in the absence of topological defects , bonds along the axis direction cut at the edge , which generally gives a local deformation - induced gauge field _ around _ the axis @xmath107 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : edge ] ) .",
    "hence , it is naturally expected to cause local modulation of the energy gap at the edge .",
    "it should be noted that the framework for the local energy gap presented here does not give the wave function of energy eigenstates in a deformed nanotube . this should be clarified in future work .    .",
    "the hopping integral along the tube axis should be modulated at the boundary , giving rise to the deformation - induced gauge field around the axis .",
