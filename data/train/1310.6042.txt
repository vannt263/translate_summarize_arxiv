    "we calculate @xmath81 produced by lbgs per redshift interval by integrating the star formation rate density , @xmath87 , of lbgs @xcite to obtain the comoving mass density of stars in lbgs , @xmath88 , and multiplying by the estimated conversion factor for the metal production rate @xmath89 @xcite .",

    "these are just lower limits to @xmath94 as we only integrate the luminosity function out to @xmath96l@xmath97 , and we must also consider the metal contribution of the faint end .",
    "recent measurements of the faint end of the luminosity function at @xmath19 @xcite suggest a significant contribution to @xmath98 from faint low mass galaxies , suggesting we may be missing as much as half the metals , depending on the effects of dust and redshift .",
    "this suggests that lbgs produce an even larger fraction of the total metals in the universe .",
    "our calculations assume that the ratio of @xmath86 to @xmath94 does not evolve significantly with redshift .",
    "this means we are assuming that lbgs still dominate the metal production at high redshift , and that the metal production rate for a given @xmath88 does not significantly depend on redshift .",
    "we compare @xmath94 to @xmath99 in figure [ fig : rho ] .",
    "the increasing @xmath83 and decreasing of dlas results in a relatively flat @xmath99 , while the @xmath94 decreases rapidly at higher redshifts . at @xmath100 , dlas comprise only @xmath101 of the metals produced by lbgs , but this fraction grows to @xmath7% by @xmath5",
    ". these ratios could be up to a factor of two overestimated due to the faint end of the luminosity function described above .",
    "regardless , this suggests that the diffuse hi gas is significantly enriched by the star - forming regions of lbgs soon after reionization , or are forming a significant fraction of metals in - situ .",
    "one intriguing consequence of the decrease in metallicity of dlas at @xmath0 is its effect on @xmath4 .",
    "the brown triangle in figure [ fig : rho ] represents @xmath4 at @xmath72 , which appears to decrease for the first time since @xmath19 .",
    "we are therefore likely measuring the beginning of a decrease in the density of metals in neutral gas as we approach the epoch of reionization .",
    "the principal result of this study is the first measurement of the cosmic metallicity of neutral gas at @xmath10 of @xmath1 .",
    "this measurement provides evidence of rapid metallicity enrichment of dlas just after the reionization epoch , with a @xmath2 deviation of from the extrapolated linear trend at @xmath0 .",
    "we also find that the contribution of dlas to the total metal budget significantly increases with redshift , emphasizing the importance of the sudden metallicity evolution .",
    "a possible explanation for the observed decrease in metallicity at the highest redshifts is that the covering fraction of neutral gas outside disks increases as a function of redshift .",
    "the combined effects of an increase in the density of the universe and a decrease in the background radiation field @xcite enable hydrogen to self - shield at densities below the virial density at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "therefore , neutral hydrogen may be found more frequently in the halos of galaxies ( e.g. in cold flows ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or in the denser regions of the intergalactic medium @xcite , creating a second population of dlas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if cold flows or the intergalactic medium have a lower level of enrichment compared to the interstellar medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the average metallicity in dlas would rapidly decline with redshift as this second dla population becomes more and more predominant .",
    "given the age of the universe at @xmath102 , this interpretation implies that metals need to be transported into the halos on short time scales , and have to either arrive in a neutral state , or recombine quickly .    besides this hypothesis",
    ", other explanations can also produce the observed change in the rate of metal enrichment in dlas , such as a change in the physical processes that enrich neutral gas within disks .",
