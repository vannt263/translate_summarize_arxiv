    "in this article we continue our investigation , begun in @xcite , of dynamics on complex surfaces for rational transformations with small topological degree .",
    "our previous work culminated in the construction of a canonical mixing invariant measure for a very broad class of such mappings .",
    "we intend now to study in detail the nature of this measure .",
    "as we will show , the measure meets conjectural expectations concerning , among other things , lyapunov exponents , entropy , product structure in the natural extension , and equidistribution of saddle orbits .    before entering into the details of our results ,",
    "let us recall our setting .",
    "let @xmath0 be a complex projective surface ( always compact and connected ) , and @xmath1 be a rational mapping .",
    "our main requirement is that @xmath2 has _ small topological degree _ :",
    "@xmath3 here the topological ( or second dynamical ) degree @xmath4 is the number of preimages of a generic point , whereas the first dynamical degree @xmath5 measures the asymptotic volume growth of preimages of curves under iteration of @xmath2 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a more precise discussion of dynamical degrees . in particular it was observed there that the existence of maps with small topological degree imposes some restrictions on the ambient surface : either @xmath0 is rational ( in particular , projective ) , or @xmath0 has kodaira dimension zero .    let us recall that the ergodic theory of mappings with large topological degree ( @xmath6 ) has been extensively studied , and that results analogous to our theorems [ thm : complete ] and [ thm : saddle ] are true in this context @xcite . in dimension 1 , all rational maps have large topological degree , and in this setting these results are due to @xcite .",
    "we note also that in the birational case @xmath7 , the main results of this paper are obtained in @xcite ( for polynomial automorphisms of @xmath8 ) in @xcite ( for automorphisms of projective surfaces ) and in @xcite ( for general birational maps ) .",
    "hence the focus here is on noninvertible mappings which , as the reader will see , present substantial additional difficulties .",
    "we will work under two additional assumptions , which we now introduce .",
    "* good birational model . *",
    "we need to assume that the linear actions @xmath9 induced by @xmath10 on cohomology are compatible with the dynamics , i.e. @xmath11 this condition , often called `` algebraic stability '' in the literature , was first considered by fornaess and sibony @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence that for any mapping @xmath12 with small topological degree , there should exist a birationally conjugate mapping @xmath13 that satisfies ( h1 ) .",
    "birational conjugacy does not affect dynamical degrees , so in this case we simply replace the given system @xmath12 with the `` good birational model '' @xmath13 .",
    "we observed in @xcite that the minimal model for @xmath0 is a good birational model when @xmath0 has kodaira dimension zero . for rational @xmath0",
    ", there is a fairly explicit blowing up proceedure @xcite that produces a good model when @xmath7 .",
    "more recently , favre and jonsson @xcite have prove that each polynomial mapping of @xmath8 with small topological degree admits a good model on passing to an iterate .",
    "under assumption ( h1 ) , in @xcite , we have constructed and studied canonical invariant currents @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "these are defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a fixed khler form on @xmath0 and @xmath18 are normalizing constants chosen so that in cohomology @xmath19 .",
    "a fact of central importance to us is that these currents have additional geometric structures : @xmath14 is laminar , while @xmath15 is woven ( see below ",
    "[ sec : geom ] for definitions ) .    * finite energy .",
    "* let @xmath20 denote the indeterminacy set of @xmath2 , i.e. the collection of those points that @xmath2 `` blows up '' to curves ; and let @xmath21 denote the analogous set of points which are images of curves under @xmath2 .",
    "the invariant current @xmath14 ( resp .",
    "@xmath15 ) typically has positive lelong number at each point of the extended indeterminacy set @xmath22 ( resp .",
    "@xmath23 ) . condition ( h1 ) is equivalent to asking that the sets @xmath24 and @xmath25 be disjoint .    in order to give meaning to and study the wedge product @xmath26 , it is desirable to have more quantitative control on how fast these sets approach one another .",
    "this is how our next hypothesis should be understood : @xmath27 we refer the reader to @xcite for a precise definition of finite energy and its relationship with recurrence properties of indeterminacy points . in that article we proved the following theorem .",
    "[ theo : ddg2 ] let @xmath2 be a meromorphic map with small topological degree on a projective surface , satisfying hypotheses ( h1 ) and ( h2 ) .",
    "then the wedge product @xmath28 is a well - defined probability invariant measure that is @xmath2-invariant and mixing .",
    "furthermore the wedge product is described by the geometric intersection of the laminar / woven structures of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the notion of `` geometric intersection '' will be described at length in ",
    "[ sec : geom ] .",
    "@xmath29    we can now state the main results of this article .",
    "let us emphasize that they rely on the hypotheses ( h1 ) and ( h2 ) only through the conclusions of theorem [ theo : ddg2 ] .",
    "taking these conclusions as a starting point , one can read the proofs given here independently of @xcite .",
    "[ thm : complete ] let @xmath0 be a complex projective surface and @xmath30 be a rational map with small topological degree .",
    "assume that @xmath2 satisfies the conclusions of theorem [ theo : ddg2 ] .",
    "then the canonical invariant measure @xmath31 has the following properties :    a.   for @xmath32-a.e .",
    "@xmath33 there exists a nonzero tangent vector @xmath34 at @xmath33 , such that @xmath35 b.   likewise , for @xmath32-a.e .",
    "@xmath33 there exist a tangent vector @xmath36 at @xmath33 , and a set of integers @xmath37 of density 1 such that @xmath38 c.   @xmath32 has entropy @xmath39 ; thus it has maximal entropy and @xmath40 .",
    "d.   the natural extension of @xmath32 has local product structure .",
    "in particular it follows from _ iv . _ and",
    "the work of ornstein and weiss @xcite ( see also briend @xcite for useful remarks on the adaptation to the noninvertible case ) that the natural extension of @xmath32 has the bernoulli property , hence @xmath32 is mixing to all orders and has the @xmath41 property . a precise definition of local product structure will be given below in  [ sec : product ] .",
    "this is the analogue of the balanced property of the maximal measure in the large topological degree case .",
    "let us stress that we do not assume that @xmath42 is @xmath32 integrable ( @xmath43 denotes the critical set ) .",
    "this condition is usually imposed to guarantee the existence of lyapunov exponents and applicability of the pesin theory of non - uniformy hyperbolic dynamical systems . however , for mappings with small topological degree , it is known to fail in general ( see @xcite ) ) .",
    "this contrasts with the large topological degree case , in which the maximal entropy measure integrates all quasi - psh functions .    when the lyapunov exponents @xmath44 are well defined , then _",
    "( i ) _ and _ ( ii ) _ imply that @xmath45 hence the measure @xmath32 is hyperbolic .",
    "these bounds are optimal and were conjectured in @xcite .    in order to go further and relate @xmath32 to the distribution of saddle periodic points",
    ", we use pesin theory and must therefore invoke the above integrability hypothesis .",
    "[ thm : saddle ] under the assumptions of theorem [ thm : complete ] , assume further that @xmath46 where @xmath43 is the critical set .",
    "then , for every @xmath47 there exists a set @xmath48 of saddle periodic points of period @xmath47 , with @xmath49 , and such that @xmath50    let @xmath51 be the set of all isolated periodic points of @xmath2 of period @xmath47 . if furthermore    * @xmath2 has no curves of periodic points , * or @xmath52 or @xmath53 ,    then @xmath54 , so that asymptotically nearly all periodic points are saddles .",
    "this theorem was proved for birational maps by the second author in @xcite ( though the possibility of a curve of periodic points was overlooked there ) .",
    "it would be interesting to prove a similar result without using pesin theory ( i.e. without assumption ( h3 ) ) .",
    "it would also be interesting to know when saddle points might lie outside @xmath55 .",
    "one can easily create isolated saddle points by blowing up an attracting fixed point with unequal eigenvalues .",
    "we then get an infinitely near saddle point in the direction corresponding to the larger multiplier , whose unstable manifold is contained in the exceptional divisor of the blow - up .",
    "we do not know any example of a saddle point outside @xmath55 whose stable and unstable manifolds are both zariski dense .",
    "while the results in this paper parallel those in @xcite , new and more elaborate arguments are needed for non - invertible maps . in particular , we are led to work in the natural extension ( e.g. for establishing _ iii . _ and _ iv .",
    "_ of theorem",
    "[ thm : complete ] ) , in a situation where there is no symmetry between the preimages along @xmath32 ( see the examples in  [ sec : idea ] ) .",
    "an interesting thing to note is that additional regularity for the potentials of the invariant currents does not help our arguments much .    under an assumption similar to ( h3 ) , de thlin and vigny @xcite have recently found an alternate way to compute entropy , using yomdin s theorem @xcite .",
    "together with the work @xcite , this leads to an alternate proof of the bounds on lyapunov exponents ( again , @xcite requires ( h3 ) ) .",
    "an advantage of their method is that it works in higher dimension .",
    "on the other hand they do not obtain local product structure nor the equidistribution of saddle orbits . in any case",
    ", it seems that computing the entropy of the mappings considered here is always a delicate issue .",
    "it is also worth noting that there are few cases in which natural invariant measures for non - invertible differentiable dynamical systems have well understood natural extensions .",
    "measures of maximal entropy for rational mappings with large topological degree ( in one and several dimensions ) afford one example . another @xcite is given by absolutely continuous invariant measures for interval maps .",
    "an important remaining question is that of uniqueness of the maximal entropy measure",
    ". let us comment a little bit on this point .",
    "the first difficulty is that another candidate measure of maximal entropy need nt integrate @xmath56 , so that it is delicate to work with .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to restrict the uniqueness problem to measures satisfying this assumption .",
    "however , even with this restriction , and even with the additional assumption that @xmath2 is birational , the problem remains unsolved .",
    "@xmath29    we now discuss applicability of our assumptions . for mappings on kodaira zero surfaces , we have seen that we can always assume that ( h1 ) is satisfied .",
    "it is actually not very hard to prove that ( h2 ) and ( h3 ) are also always true ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.8 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.5 ) ) .",
    "thus theorems [ thm : complete ] and [ thm : saddle ] yield the following :    let @xmath0 be a complex projective surface of kodaira dimension zero .",
    "let @xmath30 be a rational transformation with small topological degree .",
    "then the conclusions of theorems [ thm : complete ] and [ thm : saddle ] hold for @xmath2 .    when @xmath0 is rational our results apply notably to the case where @xmath2 is the rational extension of a polynomial mapping of @xmath57 with small topological degree . as noted above , favre and jonsson",
    "have proven that a slightly weaker variation of ( h1 ) holds for @xmath2 in a suitable compactification @xmath0 of @xmath57 . as we show in @xcite ,",
    "this variation is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "more precisely , it is explained there that though ( h1 ) holds only for some iterate @xmath58 , the currents @xmath14 and @xmath15 are actually invariant by @xmath2 . since ( h2 )",
    "depends on @xmath2 only through the currents @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and ( h3 ) holds for @xmath2 as soon as it holds for an iterate , we conclude from @xcite that ( h2 ) and ( h3 ) , hence the conclusions of theorem [ theo : ddg2 ] , hold for @xmath2 .",
    "altogether this implies the following corollary .",
    "let @xmath59 be a polynomial mapping with small topological degree .",
    "then the conclusions of theorems [ thm : complete ] and [ thm : saddle ] apply to @xmath2 .",
    "let us emphasize that the small topological degree assumption is needed here : the reader will find in @xcite an easy example of a polynomial endomorphism @xmath60 with @xmath61 such that @xmath62 .    regarding more general rational mappings on rational surfaces , we noted above there are grounds to suspect that ( h1 ) holds generally , after suitable birational conjugation . among maps satisfying ( h1 ) , there is no known example of a map that violates the energy condition ( h2 ) .",
    "we offer some evidence in @xcite that ( h2 ) might only fail in very degenerate situations . on the other hand ,",
    "we give examples @xcite of mappings satisfying ( h1 ) and ( h2 ) but not ( h3 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it seems plausible that ( h3 ) is generically satisfied ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.5 ) ) .",
    "@xmath29    the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    " [ sec : geom ] is devoted to some ( mostly non - classical ) preliminaries on geometric currents , while  [ sec : ergodic ] recalls some well - known facts from ergodic theory .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : complete ] occupies  [ sec : idea ] to  [ sec : product ] ( we give a more precise plan of the proof in  [",

    "we begin by collecting some general facts about geometric , that is laminar and woven , currents .",
    "we often use the single word `` current '' as a shorthand for `` positive closed ( 1,1 ) current on a complex surface . ''",
    "recall that a _ lamination by riemann surfaces _ is a topological space such that every point admits a neighborhood @xmath63 homeomorphic ( by @xmath64 ) to a product of the form @xmath65 ( with coordinates @xmath66 ) , where @xmath67 is some locally compact set , @xmath68 is the unit disk , and such that the transition maps @xmath69 are of the form @xmath70 , with @xmath71 holomorphic in the disk direction @xmath72 . by definition a _ plaque",
    "_ is a subset of the form @xmath73 , and a _ flow box _ is a subset of the form @xmath74 , with @xmath41 a compact set .",

    "invariant transverse measure _ is given by a collection of measures on the transverse sets @xmath67 , compatible with the transition maps @xmath69 .",
    "the survey by ghys @xcite is a good reference for these notions .",
    "we always assume that the space is separable , so that is is covered by countably many flow boxes . in this paper",
    "we will consider `` abstract '' laminations as well as laminations embedded in complex surfaces . in the latter case we require of course that the complex structure along the plaques is compatible with the ambient one .",
    "two flow boxes embedded in a manifold are said to be _ compatible _ if the corresponding plaques intersect along open sets . notice that disjoint flow boxes are compatible by definition .",
    "weak lamination _ is a countable union of compatible flow boxes .",
    "it makes sense to speak of leaves and invariant transverse measures on a weak lamination .",
    "being primarily interested in measure - theoretic properties , we need nt distinguish between ordinary and weak laminations in this paper .",
    "let us also recall that a @xmath76 current @xmath77 is uniformly laminar if it is given by integration over an embedded lamination endowed with an invariant transverse measure .",
    "that is , the restriction @xmath78 to a single flow box can be expressed @xmath79 d\\mu_{\\tau}(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the measure induced by the transverse measure on @xmath81 .",
    "the current @xmath77 is _ laminar _ if it is an integral over a measurable family of compatible holomorphic disks .",
    "equivalently , for each @xmath82 there exists an open set @xmath83 and a uniformly laminar current @xmath84 in @xmath85 such that the mass ( in @xmath0 ) of the difference satisfies @xmath86 .",
    "it is a key fact that the laminar currents we consider in this paper have some additional geometric properties .",
    "for instance , each has a natural underlying weak lamination , and the lamination carries an invariant transverse measure .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details about this .",
    "our main purpose in this section is to explore the related notion of _ woven current _ and generalize some results of @xcite that we will need afterwards .      given an open set @xmath87 in a hermitian complex surface , we let @xmath88 denote the set of ( codimension 1 ) analytic chains with volume bounded by @xmath89 . we endow @xmath88 with the topology of currents .",
    "since there is a dense sequence of test forms , this topology is metrizable .",
    "most often we identify a chain and its support , which is a closed analytic subset of @xmath87 .",
    "we denote by @xmath90 the closure of the set of analytic disks in @xmath88 .    by definition ,",
    "a _ uniformly woven current _ in @xmath87 is an integral of integration currents over chains in @xmath88 , for some @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "a _ woven current _ is an increasing limit of sums of uniformly woven currents .",
    "a given laminar current can be expressed as an integral of disks in an essentially unique fashion ( only reparameterizations up to a set of zero measure are possible ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 6.5 ) ) . for woven ( even uniformly ) currents ,",
    "this is not true .",
    "for example , @xmath91 that is , the standard khler form in @xmath8 may be written as a sum of uniformly laminar currents in two very different ways .",
    "we say that a uniformly woven current is _ marked _ if it is presented as an integral of disks .",
    "more specifically , a marking for a uniformly woven current @xmath77 in some open set @xmath87 is a positive borel measure @xmath92 on @xmath88 for some @xmath89 such that @xmath93 d{m(t)}(d).\\ ] ] abusing terminology , we will also refer to @xmath92 as the _ transverse measure _ associated to @xmath77 .",
    "we call the support of @xmath94 the _ web supporting _ @xmath77 .",
    "the woven currents considered in this paper have the additional property of being _ strongly approximable _",
    "( see  [ subs : markings ] below for the definition ) .",
    "this allows us to show ( lemmas [ lem : graph ] and [ lem : chain ] ) that their markings are concentrated on @xmath95 .",
    "we define _ strong convergence _ for marked uniformly woven currents as follows : @xmath96 strongly converges to @xmath77 if the markings @xmath97 are supported in @xmath88 for a fixed @xmath89 and converge weakly to @xmath92 .",
    "we leave the reader to check that this implies the usual convergence of currents .",
    "the woven structure for the invariant current @xmath15 has several additional properties , which play a crucial role in the paper .",
    "we say that a current @xmath77 is a _ strongly approximable woven current _ if it is obtained as a limit of divisors @xmath98/d_n$ ] whose geometric genus is @xmath99 ( here by definition the geometric genus of a chain is the sum of the genera of its components ) .",
    "see @xcite for a proof that @xmath15 is of this type .",
    "its woven structure can be constructed as follows .",
    "we fix two generically transverse linear projections @xmath100 , and subdivisions by squares of the projection bases . for each square @xmath101 , we discard from the approximating sequence @xmath98/d_n$ ] all connected components @xmath102 over @xmath103 which are not graphs of area @xmath104 .",
    "the geometric assumption on @xmath105 implies that the corresponding loss of mass is small . taken together ,",
    "the two projections divide the ambient manifold into a collection @xmath106 of `` cubes '' of size @xmath107 and these partition the remaining well - behaved part of @xmath98/d_n$ ] into a collection of uniformly woven currents @xmath108 whose sum @xmath109 closely approximates @xmath98/d_n$ ] .",
    "the disks constituting @xmath109 will be referred to as `` good components '' .",
    "more specifically we define a _ cube _ to be a subset of the form @xmath110 , where the @xmath111 are squares . near a point where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are regular and the squares @xmath111 are small enough , @xmath87 is actually biholomorphic to an affine cube .",
    "the woven current @xmath108 , or more precisely its marking @xmath114 , is defined by assigning mass @xmath115 to each ` good ' component of @xmath116 .",
    "then we have the mass estimate @xmath117/d_n\\big)=o(r^2)$ ] , independent of @xmath47 , where @xmath107 is the size of the cubes .",
    "there is a subtle point here .",
    "the number of disks constituting @xmath116 might be much larger than @xmath118 .",
    "thus the masses of the measures @xmath114 might not be bounded above uniformly in @xmath47 . however , by lelong s theorem @xcite the disks intersecting a smaller subcube @xmath119 have volume bounded from below , so there are no more than @xmath120 of these .",
    "restricting the marking to these disks gives rise to a new current , which we continue to denote by @xmath108 , that coincides with the old one on @xmath119 .",
    "the mass of @xmath114 is now locally uniformly bounded in @xmath121 , and we may extract a convergent subsequence , letting @xmath122 denote the limiting measure and @xmath123 the corresponding current .",
    "let @xmath124 be the sum of these currents , where @xmath87 ranges over the subdivision @xmath106 .",
    "we then have that @xmath125 .",
    "finally , we consider a increasing sequence of subdivisions by cubes @xmath126 of size @xmath127 , and by the previous procedure we obtain an increasing sequence of currents @xmath128 , converging to @xmath77 by the previous estimate .",
    "notice that in the case of @xmath14 the construction is the same , except that at each step the disks constituting the @xmath109 are disjoint so that the @xmath124 are uniformly laminar .    since the approximating disks are restrictions of graphs over each projection , the marking of @xmath123 has the following additional virtues .",
    "[ lem : graph ] the multiplicity with which disks in @xmath129 converge to chains belonging to @xmath130 is always equal to one . similarly , if a chain @xmath131 is a hausdorff limit of other chains @xmath132 , then the multiplicity of convergence is equal to one .",
    "thus there is no folding ; i.e. in either cases the corresponding tangent spaces also converge .",
    "in particular the chains in @xmath133 are non - singular .",
    "on the other hand , the hausdorff limit of a sequence of disks might not be itself a disk but rather a chain with several components .",
    "as an example , consider the family of parabolas @xmath134 , @xmath135 , each restricted to the ( open ) unit bidisk .",
    "for @xmath136 the restriction has a single simply connected component .",
    "but when @xmath137 , it becomes disconnected . the following observation will be useful to us in several places .",
    "[ lem : chain ] for generic subdivisons by squares of the projection bases of @xmath112 and @xmath113 , we have that @xmath122-almost every chain is a disk ( i.e. has only one component ) .    recall that each chain in the support of @xmath114 is obtained by intersecting a graph over some square in the base of e.g. @xmath112 with the preimage @xmath138 of a square in the base of @xmath113 .",
    "so if a sequence of disks has a disconnected limit , then the limit must be a piece of a graph tangent to some fiber of @xmath113 .",
    "however , a graph over @xmath112 that is not outright contained in a fiber of @xmath113 will be tangent to at most countably many fibers of @xmath113 . since we have uncountably many choices for the subdivision by squares associated to @xmath113 , the result follows from standard measure theory arguments .",
    "let @xmath139 be an open subset , and @xmath140 , @xmath141 be two holomorphic chains in @xmath87 .",
    "we define @xmath142{\\dot{\\wedge}\\hspace{.15em}}[d']$ ] as the sum of point masses , counting multiplicities , at isolated intersections of @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "given more generally two marked uniformly woven currents @xmath143 and @xmath144 , with associated measures @xmath145 and @xmath146 , we define the _ geometric intersection _ as @xmath147{\\dot{\\wedge}\\hspace{.15em}}[d_2 ] \\left(dm_1\\otimes dm_2\\right ) ( d_1 , d_2).\\ ] ] in general it is necessary to take multiplicities into account because of the possibility of persistently non transverse intersection of chains .",
    "notice that the definition depends not only on the currents but also on the markings .",
    "the following basic proposition says that under reasonable assumptions the wedge product of uniformly woven currents is geometric .",

    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.6 ) for a proof . as a corollary , if @xmath148 , the geometric wedge product @xmath150 is independent of the markings .",
    "since woven currents are less well - behaved than laminar ones , we do not try as in the laminar case @xcite to give an intrinsic definition of the geometric intersection of woven currents .",
    "instead we focus only on the particular situation that arises in this paper : we have strongly approximable currents @xmath14 ( laminar ) and @xmath15 ( woven ) in @xmath0 , whose geometric structures are obtained by extracting good components of approximating curves , as explained in the previous subsection .",
