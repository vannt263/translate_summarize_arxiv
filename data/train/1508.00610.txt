    "the idea of describing bosons and fermions , having spin numbers up to 2 , by means of a fermionic field had been put forward by louis de broglie [ 1 ] .",
    "moreover , dirac@xmath0s nonlinear spinor field wave equation brought out a successful interpretation of electron and anti - electron ( positron ) system [ 2 ] .",
    "later , heisenberg and pauli developed this equation in their unified field theory [ 3 ] .",
    "after these studies , great efforts were begun among theoretical physicists in searching new nonlinear massless conformal invariant field equations without dimensional parameters that especially would have classical solutions . in this context gursey",
    "proposed a model as a possible basis for a unitary description of elementary particles which possesses broader dynamical symmetries compared to the dirac@xmath0s and heisenberg et al.@xmath0s works [ 4 ] .",
    "this model has been the first conformally invariant 4-d pure fermionic model and aroused a great interest .",
    "later a class of its exact solutions with nonlinear @xmath1 self - coupled spinor term was found and they were shown to be instantonic in character [ 5 , 6 ] .",
    "these classical solutions are similar to the solutions of pure yang - mills [ 7 ] equations in 4-d .",
    "another spinor field system came with the work of thirring [ 8 ] after gursey s one .",
    "thirring@xmath0s conformally invariant model describes dirac fermions in ( 1 + 1 ) space - time dimensions with no mass ; but with non - linear self - interaction term @xmath2 .",
    "it contains many typical features of the quantization of relativistic quantum field theories .",
    "classical instanton - type solutions for this 2-d fermionic model were found too .",
    "it has been shown that these solutions were of the same form as the solutions of 4-d model [ 9 ] .    in some cases",
    ", nonlinear classical field theories provide the possibility of deriving equation of motion of a particle as a singularity regarding from the point of field equation .",
    "but they have some disadvantages , like difficulties encountered in the solution and quantization of the equations .",
    "some studies on the quantization and renormalization of the 4-d spinor wave equation have also been performed [ 10 - 13 ] .",
    "recently , the role of the coupling constant in the evolution of 4-d spinor - type instantons has been studied [ 14 ] . after a while",
    ", dynamics of excited instantons in four - dimension have been investigated by the methods derived from nonlinear dynamical techniques [ 15 ] .",
    "chaos has also been observed in the above mentioned 4-d dissipative nonlinear fermionic model [ 16 ] . in this paper , we re - consider the classical equations derived from the conformal invariant 2-d and 4-d pure spinor fermionic systems obtained by the heisenberg@xmath0s ansatz .",
    "firstly we compare the stability characterization of these spinor type instantons with that of duffing equation .",
    "secondly we periodically excited these nonlinear systems in order to understand how this stability character can be affected .",
    "for this purpose , we built the bifurcation diagrams of the systems and construct the poincar sections depending on the excitation amplitude and frequency of the external forcing term .",
    "the 2-d fermion - fermion interaction is described by the conformal invariant lagrangian @xmath3 the fermion field @xmath4 has the scale dimension @xmath5 [ 8 ] .",
    "the equation of motion that follows from this lagrangian is @xmath6 where @xmath7 are pauli matrices and @xmath8 is the positive coupling constant .      a conventional generalization of the lagrangian ( 2.1 ) to 4-d",

    "it was shown that eq . ( 2.4 ) is invariant under conformal transformations [ 4 ] .",
    "this 4-d conformally invariant pure fermionic model with a nonlinear self - coupled spinor term is similar to the heisenberg@xmath0s nonlinear generalization of dirac@xmath0s equation [ 2 ] .",
    "in ref . [ 17 ] a special technique was introduced to find @xmath15 by spontaneous symmetry breaking of the full conformal group and characterizing by being invariant under the transformations of a special subgroup which turns out to reflect the final symmetry properties of the ground state of the system .",
    "this was realized with the help of an @xmath16 operator @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the 4-momentum and @xmath19 is the conformal scale invariance operators in the 4-d euclidean space - time .",
    "here @xmath20 is a parameter with the dimension of length . in this way",
    "the problem has been reduced to finding the solution of the following equation @xmath21 \\left(\\bar \\psi \\psi\\right ) = 0\\ ] ] as @xmath22 this solution has been named as instanton type solution",
    ". then the euclidian configuration form of heisenberg ansatz [ 3 ] @xmath23c\\ ] ] with an arbitrary spinor constant @xmath24 was introduced . here",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are real functions of @xmath27    in ref .",
    "[ 9 ] , the instanton and meron types of classical solutions were found in the case of 2-d conformal invariant lagrangian exploiting the same symmetry arguments as for gauge and scalar fields .",
    "one of them leads to the vanishing of energy - momentum tensor and finite action [ 8 , 9 ] . vanishing of energy - momentum tensor gives this solution a chance to be a candidate for a vacuum in the quantum world , since classical solutions are interpreted as vacuum expectation values .",
    "also the instanton and meron types of classical solutions were found in the case of 4-d conformal invariant lagrangian and shown that they correspond to a spontaneous breaking of space - time symmetries [ 5 , 6 ] .",

    "so the fix points are elliptic [ 18 ] .",
    "the details of these calculations can be found in ref.18 .",
    "through the following investigation firstly the duffing - type stability of our 2-d and 4-d spinor - type equations will be checked .",
    "therefore we firstly like to touch on duffing oscillator equation , the famous example describing the motion of a classical particle in a double well potential [ 19 ] .",
    "various works have been performed on this equation for many years .",
    "this is due to its being a representative of many non linear systems , with its extremely rich dynamics - many complex solutions and chaotic behaviours .",

    "the dynamics of many nonlinear oscillators have been studied widely under sinusoidal external forcing since its easy application to real physical systems .",
    "this kind of forcing can also be helpful to control and create various nonlinear behaviours in dynamical systems . in this paper ,",

    "a collection of trajectories will occupy a constant volume of a region of phase space as the trajectories move around under the dynamics of the system .",
