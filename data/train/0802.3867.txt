    "hard interaction models have played an important role in the understanding of the nature and structure of simple liquids and crystals made of particles with spherical symmetry . for anisotropic particles , the hard ellipsoid ( he ) and",
    "hard - spherocylinder ( hsc ) models have played a role similar to that of the hard - sphere model ( hs ) in simple liquids , though these models are not so universal as the hs model . in particular , he and hsc fluids exhibit an isotropic ",
    "nematic phase transition but , while the hsc fluid shows a stable smectic phase , all evidence to date suggests that the he fluid does not @xcite . clearly , the formation of the smectic phase must be the result of delicate packing effects directly related to particle shape .",
    "this feature of the he fluid is a clear disadvantage in the formulation of perturbation theories for liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "the problem of why hard ellipsoids do not get stabilised into a layered smectic structure is in intriguing one .",
    "the properties of a perfectly aligned fluid of ellipsoids can be mapped onto those of hard spheres , and the hs fluid does not exhibit phases with order intermediate between the fluid and the crystal . on top of that , orientational freedom probably plays against smectic formation .",
    "recent simulation work on parallel hard ellipsoids augmented by an isotropic square well have shown that , in this system , smectic layers can be stabilised@xcite ; however , in view of the rather artificial model potential used , the result probably does not reflect any essentially interesting underlying property of ellipsoids .",
    "the physical reason for the absence of smectic order in the he fluid obviously lies in the geometrical properties of an ellipsoid .",
    "wen and meyer@xcite addressed the general problem of smectic formation in fluids of parallel hard rods .",
    "they provided an explanation in terms of the entropy gain involved in the increased packing efficiency in smectic layers , which more than outweighs the entropy loss associated with the onset of layering with respect to the nematic phase .",
    "this efficiency is very much reduced in ellipsoids due to particle shape , since ellipsoids arranged in a layer leave too much void space .",
    "alternatively one may think that increasing packing , which would involve filling this space , entails interlocking between the layers , which promotes crystalline order but discourages formation of the smectic phase .",
    "a question that can be asked to understand this problem from a different perspective is the following : if we perturb the shape of an ellipsoid in the direction of a spherocylinder or a cylinder , both of which exhibit smectic phases @xcite , for which particle shape does smectic stability set in ?",
    "the answer to this question may provide some further insight into the relation between particle geometry and smectic stability . as a bonus , it would help formulate more useful hard  body models that can be used in perturbation theories .",
    "only a few previous studies have addressed this issue .",
    "of particular relevance to our study is that of evans@xcite , who used an onsager second - virial coefficient approximation to investigate smectic formation in fluids made of hard ellipsoids , hard spherocylinders and hard ellipocylinders , a particle with a shape somehow intermediate between that of the first two .",
    "the ellipsoids , both parallel and with unconstrained orientations , did not form a smectic phase before the crystal , while the other particles did at some particular density prior to crystallization .",
    "it was concluded that ellipsoids are pathological in that they do not form a smectic phase@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we again address this problem by studying a _ continuum _ of particle shapes , in the limit of parallel particles , but this time interpolating between the ellipsoid and the _ cylinder _ by means of a model , the _ hard superellipsoid _",
    "( hse ) of revolution , containing an exponent @xmath0 that can be varied continuously .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are used to analyse the stability of the smectic phase and other phases with partial positional order ( i.e. columnar phase ) of the parallel model ( phse ) , in the region of geometries close to the ellipsoid , and an approximate phase diagram as a function of @xmath0 is obtained .",
    "the columnar phase is not stable in the phase diagram .",
    "mc simulations of freely rotating cut spheres have shown that the columnar phase can be stabilised for some range of aspect ratios @xcite .",
    "however simulations of parallel cylinders do not give conclusive evidence for the presence of columnar symmetry in the phase diagram @xcite , and a recent fundamental measure theory ( fmt ) for parallel cylinders @xcite also rules out the columnar phase as a thermodynamically stable phase .",
    "however , one of the conclusions of the present paper is that the smectic phase _ can _ be stabilised with respect to the nematic phase for some type of phse particles .",
    "therefore , in the approximation of parallel particles , ellipsoids do not seem to be pathological ; rather it is a continuum of particle shapes , close to the ellipsoidal , that do not exhibit smectic order . to complement these studies , a density  functional theory based on the parsons ",
    "lee approach @xcite was used to investigate the relative stability of the smectic phase with respect to other phases with lower symmetry . for the crystal phase",
    ", a free  volume approximation is used .",
    "the main conclusion that can be drawn is that the parsons ",
    "lee approximation , in combination with free ",
    "volume theory , only gives a qualitative picture of the relative stability of the phases .",
    "the precise location of the transition points are incorrect .",
    "other features , such as the fact that the columnar phase is not stable , appear to be correctly described .",
    "resort to other , more sophisticated theories , e.g. of the fmt type , would be needed to obtain a better description . however , although the initial framework of the fmt for general convex particles was initially developed by rosenfeld @xcite , its application only works for isotropic fluids , as it was shown in ref .",
    "for some simple geometries ( such as parallelepipedic ) the fmt can be formulated from first principles with restricted particle orientations @xcite . the generalisation of the fmt to geometries like the ones described here seems to be a rather difficult task .",
    "we consider parallel particles with symmetry of revolution ( axially symmetric about the @xmath7 axis ) .",
    "the superellipsoid results by making a superellipse in the @xmath8@xmath7 plane revolve around the @xmath7 axis , with the equation @xmath9 @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the semi - lengths of the particle in the @xmath12 plane and along the @xmath7 axis , respectively , and @xmath0 is the shape exponent .",
    "this equation defines a particle with a geometry interpolating between the ellipsoid ( @xmath1 ) and the cylinder ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "note that the phse model is different from that used by evans@xcite , whose model interpolates between an ellipsoid and a spherocylinder .",
    "[ fig1 ] depicts a few bodies ( with @xmath13 , which could be called _ superspheres _ ) for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "thermodynamic and structural properties of such a fluid of parallel particles scale trivially with particle elongation , so that it is sufficient to consider the case @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the particle breadth .    the stable low",
    " density phase of the phse model is a nematic phase ( all particles oriented along the @xmath7 axis and with their centers of mass disordered positionally ) . at high densities",
    "we expect a solid phase with some crystalline structure ( the question of which structure is stabilised will be addressed later ) . at intermediate densities",
    "we could , in principle , expect different phases with partial order ( smectic or columnar ) to get stabilised , depending on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "to explore the phase behaviour of the phse model we used constant  pressure mc simulation .",
    "we have simulated systems of @xmath16@xmath17 particles , with @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "both compression runs from the low - density nematic phase and expansion runs from a high - density crystalline structure were conducted . from these",

    "( some of which , as we will see , undergo a first  order phase transition ) can not be ascertained , since no attempt was made at computing absolute free energies .",
    "structural quantities , such as density profiles along the ordering direction , @xmath20 , and radial distribution functions parallel and perpendicular to this direction , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , were also calculated .",
    "all this information allows us to get a picture of the trends in phase behaviour that can be expected as the exponent @xmath0 is varied .    to complement simulation results ,",

    "density phase is a nematic ( n phase ) , since all particles are parallel , whereas the system crystallises at high density ( k phase ) .",
    "we begin by discussing the high  density region , where the crystal phase is the stable phase .",
    "as expected , compression runs starting from the low  density nematic phase ( open squares in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) ultimately create a defected crystal , via a first  order phase transition ( this appears as a clear density discontinuity in all cases ) .",
    "expansion runs from a perfect high  density crystal ( filled squares in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) give a solid branch with defect ",
    "free structures in most instances . however , in small systems defects consisting of columns of particles that have moved along the director by a fraction of the unit cell are created .",
    "this may give the impression that averaged structures correspond to a stable columnar phase .",
    "a related situation was found in the simulations of veerman and frenkel on parallel hard cylinders @xcite , where a strong dependence of columnar stability on system size was found .    to investigate this ,",
    "we prepared initial configurations with columnar symmetry at high density ; in expansion runs , the system always stayed as a columnar phase ( triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , for large system sizes , systems with columnar and crystalline structures look as though they are actually mechanically stable , and there seems to be a large free  energy barrier between the two structures .",
    "however , compressions from the nematic never give rise to configurations containing partial columnar order ( which would seem easier to generate than full three  dimensional order ) . without explicit calculation of free energies",
    ", no definite conclusion can be reached on the relative stabilities of columnar and crystalline phases ; however , given that no clear evidence for columnar ordering has been found in simulations of parallel hard cylinders @xcite , and that fmt calculations on the same system predict that columnar order is not thermodynamically stable @xcite , we believe it unlikely that a columnar phase may get stabilised in phse .    as the crystal is expanded to lower density the system looses translational order ( either totally or partially ) , and becomes fluid via a discontinuity in density .",
    "[ grs](c ) shows the radial distribution functions along and perpendicular to the director , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , in the crystal phase for the case @xmath45 .",
    "both present a high degree of structure , as expected in a crystalline phase .",
    "therefore all evidence suggests that there is a first  order fluid ",
    "crystal ( i.e. freezing ) transition .",
    "the question on the nature of the crystalline phase and how the system is prepared in the expansion runs deserves some comments .",
    "in fact the symmetry of the structure seems to change at some value of @xmath0 .",
    "the generic crystal structure consists of stacked triangular layers , either in phase ( aaa structure ) or out of phase .",
    "the latter may have abca ... , abab ... , or random  stacking structures , all of these being compact structures ( i.e. they share the same value of the close  packing density ) .",
    "a priori one could consider the aaa , abc and abab structures to be the most stable candidates , reflecting simple hexagonal , face  centred  cubic and hexagonal  close  packed  like symmetries , respectively ( the final structures obtained by the simulations do not have these exact symmetries , since the intralayer unit ",
    "cell distance does not exactly correspond to the interlayer spacing expected in these structures ; obviously this is a consequence of the asymmetry of the particles along and perpendicular to their symmetry axes ) .",
    "the situation , for lack of a more detailed analysis based on free  energy estimations is , as usual , uncertain ( cf .",
    "the old debate on the hard  sphere crystal @xcite ) , presumably due to very small free  energy differences . for freely rotating ellipsoids",
    "a recent work has shown the existence of a different crystal packing consisting of a simple monoclinic lattice with a basis of two ellipsoids with different orientations@xcite ( of course this structure can not occur in our parallel  particle model ) . in our case of parallel phse particles with @xmath46 , simulations with between 8 to 12 layers along the @xmath7 direction",
    "may give structures with any type of stacking depending on how the initial configuration is prepared ( in the limit @xmath1 , we know that abc stacking is preferred @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath47 , the aaa structure is clearly more stable , and it is expected that somewhere in the interval @xmath48 there is a change in the nature of the crystal phase .",
    "some preliminary simulations indicate that the critical value may be between @xmath49 and @xmath19 ( e.g. a crystal with @xmath45 , when prepared with aaa stacking , shows a strong tendency to evolve towards random stacking , whereas the system with @xmath50 , when prepared with abc stacking , evolves towards aaa stacking ) , but free  volume theory gives a rather higher value ( see later ) .",
    "now the central question of the present paper is whether there exists an intermediate , stable fluid phase between the low  density nematic and the high  density crystal phase . in the limit",
    "@xmath1 ( parallel ellipsoids ) ones knows for certain that there are no phases with partial ( smectic or columnar ) order @xcite .",
    "by contrast , in the opposite limit @xmath2 ( parallel cylinders ) previous mc simulations @xcite indicate that the nematic phase changes to a smectic phase via a continuous transition . clearly in our interaction model , which interpolates between these two limits , there must be a value of @xmath0 beyond which the smectic phase becomes stable .",
    "actually this is the case . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] cases where a smectic phase has been identified are indicated by a corresponding label ( s for smectic ) .",
    "evidence for the s phase comes from density distributions ( see later ) , as the pressure shows no sign of a n  s transition , pointing to a continuous transition .",
    "we should note that recent simulations on freely - rotating hard spherocylinders in the limit of infinite aspect ratio have shown that the nematic - smectic transition is of first order@xcite .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the parallel alignment constraint is responsible for the second - order nature of the n - s transition of hard cylinders , and this could also be the case in our model . by increasing the pressure further ( compression run ) , the smectic phase transforms into a defected crystal phase via a first  order phase transition .    as mentioned above ,",
    "our simulations indicate that a smectic phase stabilises for _ finite _ @xmath0 , i.e. in the range @xmath51 , where @xmath4 is some critical value .",
    "indirect evidence comes from computation of density profiles , smectic order parameter ( not shown ) and correlation functions . in fig .",
    "[ rhos ] the evolution of the density profile @xmath20 , as density is increased , is shown for the case @xmath45 .",
    "the onset of smectic order is clearly identified by the smooth appearance of density peaks .",
    "the density profiles exhibit a clear stratification at a packing fraction @xmath52 . that the high  density phase in question is smectic , and not crystalline , can be concluded from the radial distribution functions along and perpendicular to the director , shown in figs .",
    "[ grs](a ) and ( b ) , which point to in  plane fluid  like correlations in the intermediate phase .",
    "analysis of the case @xmath53 , in contrast , suggests no evidence for a smectic phase : the nematic fluid freezes directly into a crystal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , similarly to the case of ellipsoids .",
    "the intermediate case @xmath54 , however , does show signs of smectic stability .",
    "> from all the information collected for the various systems analysed , we estimate the critical value of @xmath0 associated with the onset of stability of the smectic phase to be in the range @xmath55@xmath6 .    fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] summarises our results in the form of a phase diagram of packing fraction @xmath34 vs. inverse exponent @xmath56 . for @xmath57 the smectic phase ( s in the graph )",
    "is stable .",
    "simulation data for the limit @xmath2 ( cylinders , filled triangles and squares ) are taken from simulations by veerman and frenkel @xcite , and are essentially exact as they were inferred from simulations incorporating free - energy calculations .",

    "transition densities for the nematic ",
    "smectic , nematic ",
    "crystal and smectic  crystal transitions are only approximate .",
    "as already mentioned , the first ( indicated by open circles ) is of second order .",
    "the others ( open triangles and squares ) are of first  order , with a wide density gap ; since no free energies were computed , we only plot , using vertical bars , approximate limits of metastability of the two phases involved ( the symbols are only the average packing ",
    "fraction values inferred from the estimated limits of metastability ) .",
    "a second aim of our study is to rationalise the findings from computer simulation using theoretical models . as mentioned in sec .",
    "iii , we have considered three theoretical models : a low  density virial expansion up to third order in density for the low ",
    "density nematic phase ( v3 ) , a resummed virial expansion of the parsons  lee type ( pl ) for intermediate densities , and free  volume ( fv ) theory for the high  density crystal .",
    "the v3 theory was initially used to analyse possible bifurcations of the nematic phase to smectic or columnar phases @xcite .",
    "the qualitative results as far as the continuous nematic ",
    "smectic transition is concerned are the same for both v3 and pl theories ; they only differ quantitatively , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for large values of @xmath56 ( the only available from simulations ) , the mc data are bracketed by the two theories , but the trend that the packing fraction at bifurcation increases with @xmath56 in this regime is captured correctly .",
    "this increase is basically due to the decrease in particle volume as cylinders change to ellipsoids .",
    "the differences between the v3 and pl predictions can be traced back to their different treatment of correlations : v3 includes three  body correlations exactly , but the remaining terms are neglected , while pl only includes the exact two  body correlations but approximately resums the higher  order density correlations .",
    "the pl theory , together with the fv theory for the crystal , were used to compute the nematic  solid and smectic  solid transitions .",
    "these are first  order transitions , with a wide density gap .",
    "the two  phase region merges with the nematic ",
    "smectic spinodal coming from lower densities at a critical end  point located at @xmath58 ; this value approximately agrees with that inferred from the simulations . for lower values of @xmath0",
    "there is direct coexistence between nematic and solid phases , and the theory also seems to agree with simulations in the limit of hard spheres ( this agreement is fortuitous as it is well known that the pl theory is inappropriate to model spatial correlations in the hard - sphere fluid ; the weighted - density theory @xcite or a theory based on fmt @xcite are known to be more adequate ) . in the opposite limit ( cylinders ) , however , there is a big discrepancy with simulation , not only in the location of the nematic ",
    "smectic spinodal and the smectic  solid phase transition , but also in the density gap of the latter which is significantly overestimated as compared to the mc simulations . in this limit",
    "the weighted - density type theories , developed for a hsc fluid @xcite , are obviously more appropriate to predict the spatial correlations . the pl and",
    "fv theories were also used to compute the smectic ",
    "columnar and columnar  solid transitions .",
    "these results are not plotted in the phase diagram since the region of columnar stability is always preempted by crystallization directly from the smectic phase ; this feature also agrees with simulations which , as mentioned before , do not seem to give conclusive evidence for stable columnar ordering in this model .",
    "the quality of the different approximations , in the density range where each of them was used , can be checked by examining the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ eos ] , which refers to the case @xmath45 .",
    "the figure also contains the mc simulation data .",
    "the pl theory , which reduces to the carnahan ",
    "starling approximation for the nematic phase ( continuous line ) , represents correctly the eos up to packing fractions of @xmath59 , just before the transition to the smectic phase occurs ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the pl theory is not as accurate for the smectic phase ( dashed line ) , since it overestimates the pressure .",
    "the nematic  smectic transition density ( bifurcation point ) is reasonably well reproduced . in the solid branch ( dotted line ) , the equation of state is accurately represented ( in fact better as the density approaches the close  packing limit ) , as expected , but the smectic  solid transition is not correctly reproduced ( value of pressure , location of transition densities and density gap ) , due to the defects in the smectic and solid equations of state .",
    "we can conclude from our study that there is clear evidence that in the phse fluid smecticity begins to be favoured entropically beyond a critical value of the exponent @xmath58@xmath6 ; this is surprisingly close to the value corresponding to ellipsoids ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "therefore , the fluid of parallel hard ellipsoids does not seem to be pathological or special in not exhibiting a stable smectic phase ; rather , there is a family of particle shapes beyond the ellipsoid that do not possess stable smectic phases , although the extent of the family in parameter space is small .",
    "the explanation for this behaviour lies , of course , in the packing efficiency of these hard  particle fluids .",
    "the formation of the smectic phase is the result of a delicate packing effect directly related to particle shape . in the he fluid",
    ", the ellipsoidal geometry creates a large tendency for particles to interlock at their ends , which favors the stabilisation of the crystal phase with detriment to the smectic phase .",
    "this effect is not relevant in the case of hsc and sets in at some intermediate particle shape .",
    "our simulation results seem to indicate that the columnar phase is not stable for this family of parallel rods . but free - energy computations will be needed to settle this question . however , in common with the case of parallel cylinders , it is not likely that the columnar phase will be stable in our model .",
    "all these conclusions correspond to the model of parallel particles .",
    "analysis should be extended to consider particles with free orientational degrees of freedom .",
    "given the high degree of orientational order of the smectic phases , we do no think the conclusions drawn from our study will be changed substantially .",
    "as a byproduct of our analysis , we have assessed the validity of various theoretical approximations by comparison with the simulation results .",
    "a combination of free  volume and pl theories qualitatively predicts the correct phase stability , but the agreement is far from quantitative , except in the parameter region close to the spheres ; in particular , the value of shape anisotropy beyond which smectic stability sets in is quite in agreement with simulations .",
    "use of the pl theory to consistently describe all phases is not adequate , since this theory progressively degrades as order builds up in the system : therefore , the agreement is probably fortuitous .    an obvious avenue to improve the theoretical treatment is to use a more sophisticated theory , which is still to be formulated .",
    "a promising approach is fmt , which one hopes would correctly predict the relative stability of non - uniform phases ; this belief is based on fmt calculations applied to the particular case of parallel hard cylinders , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the extension of this theory to superellipsoidal geometry would demand the use of strong approximations , in the line of ref .",
    "@xcite where only the first terms of the excess free - energy asymptotic expansion with respect to @xmath60 ( with @xmath61 the particle aspect ratio ) are taken into account .",
    "this procedure could disrupt the high predictive power of fmt as concerns the precise location of phase transitions and the relative stability of different non - uniform phases .",
    "further investigation of this problem would be needed but is left for future work .",
    "interesting questions on the effect of particle shape on the depletion interaction between two anisotropic bodies mediated by small spherical particles can be studied within the present model .",
    "recent studies have shown that particle geometry has a strong effect on the depletion forces @xcite .",
    "the present model can be used to tune the geometry of the particle with a single parameter , from ellipsoids to cylinders , and allows the study of the evolution of the depletion potential with respect to @xmath0 when two superellipsoids are immersed in a sea of small hard spheres .",

    "the density distributions for smectic and columnar symmetries were parameterized using two different approaches .",
    "the first , based on a fourier expansion , is more adequate for relatively low mean densities , while the other , a parameterization based on two parameters ( one being a measure of the width of the density peaks , the other being the smectic or columnar lattice parameters periods ) , is more appropriate for high  density phases , as the numerical convergence of the minimization schemes is much easier when the parameter space is reduced to two variables .",
    "we have used the following parameterization for the density profile of the smectic phase : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the mean density , @xmath77 the wave number ( @xmath78 being the smectic period ) , @xmath79 the minimization parameter , and @xmath80 the zeroth order modified bessel function . inserting this expression into the parsons  lee functional , eqn .",

    "we have minimized the total energy @xmath93 with respect to @xmath79 and @xmath78 for a fixed value of @xmath34 .    for the columnar phase ,",

    "the gaussian width is controlled by the parameter @xmath99 which , together with @xmath10 , define the set of minimization variables .",
