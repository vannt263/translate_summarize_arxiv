    "often , a consistent string background belongs to a `` family '' of consistent backgrounds which can be deformed into each other by continously changing parameters .",
    "a simple example is the bosonic string compactified on an @xmath0 dimensional torus @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the parameters which can be continuously changed are the constant background metric and @xmath2 field , which can be put into an @xmath3 matrix @xmath4 . out of these , backgrounds are equivalent if they are related by a t - duality transformation .",
    "the dualities are given by the automorphisms @xmath5 of the even selfdual charge lattice .",
    "the subject of the present talk is to consider @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a semisimple compact group .",
    "the deformation of the cartan torus is a non - trivial modification of the discussion above since the geometry is not a product geometry . as a warm up we will consider the trivial case of a circle compactified string , i.e.  @xmath8 .",
    "next , we will move to the non - abelian rank one group @xmath9 and finally the general case of a semisimple compact otherwise arbitrary group will be presented .",
    "this talk is based on the paper@xcite .",
    "the worldsheet action for a circle compactified direction @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath11 is compactified on a unit circle and the radius of the actual circle is encoded in the target space metric @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding equation of motion can be given the interpretation of a chiral or an anti - chiral conversation law @xmath14 these currents are conformal primaries of dimension @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "hence the product @xmath17 is a marginal operator .",
    "it is easy to see that an infinitesimal change in the `` deformation parameter '' @xmath18 corresponds to a marginal perturbation , @xmath19 and hence all circle compactifications can be obtained from the string compactified on a unit circle and exact marginal deformations . as we will see , the situation in less trivial cases is slightly more complicated as the form of the chiral and anti - chiral currents can depend on the value of the deformation parameter .    in the reminder of this section",
    "we will discuss some constructions which are trivial in this simple case but turn out to be useful in more general cases to be discussed later .",
    "first , we formulate the circle compactified string as a coset theory @xmath20 .",
    "( in later applications the first @xmath21 factor will be a subgroup of @xmath7 whose size can not be chosen arbitrarily in a straightforward way . )",
    "the sigma model action for the product group is @xmath22 the coset action is obtained by first gauging the isometry @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "that means , that we promote the global symmetry to a local one by replacing partial derivatives with covariant ones , @xmath25 where the gauge field @xmath26 transforms as @xmath27 .",
    "next , we gauge fix e.g.  @xmath28 and eliminate the gauge field by solving its algebraic equation of motion . this results in @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "hence , we obtain all circle compactified strings with @xmath31 .",
    "radii larger than one can be generated by t - duality .",
    "the unit circle , however , can be reached only as a limit in this construction .",
    "therefore , we will focus on a different construction in the rest of the talk , namely the orbifold construction .",
    "let @xmath32 be a positive integer .",
    "than the circle compactified models can be written as @xmath33 where the @xmath34 action is chosen such that it reduces the size of the circle by a factor @xmath35 .",
    "next , we keep the rank of the group to be one but increase its dimensionality , i.e.  we consider strings on an su(2 ) group manifold .",
    "the worldsheet action for strings on group manifolds is the wzw model action @xmath36 , \\label{wzw - model}\\ ] ] where the level @xmath32 is a positive integer , @xmath2 is an auxiliary three dimensional manifold whose boundary is the worldsheet @xmath37 and @xmath38 in order to be specific , we parameterize the su(2 ) group element by euler angles , @xmath39 such that the action ( [ wzw - model ] ) now reads @xmath40 since , the metric and b - field do not depend on two of the coordinates there is an @xmath41 group generating new conformal backgrounds .",
    "an @xmath42 subgroup corresponds to exact marginal deformations@xcite .",
    "( for general backgrounds not depending on a certain number of coordinates the discussion can be found in@xcite , for an algebraic discussion see@xcite . )",
    "exact marginal deformations of the su(2 ) model ( or its non - compact version ) have been also constructed using the coset method in@xcite . in either of these papers",
    "one can find the action for the deformed model to be , @xmath43 the deformation parameter @xmath18 runs from zero to infinity and the undeformed model ( [ su2 ] ) is obtained for @xmath44 . in addition , there is a non - trivial dilaton which will be discussed later . to confirm that changing @xmath18 corresponds to an exact marginal deformation we first notice that due to the equations of motion the following chiral and anti - chiral currents are conserved : @xmath45 now , it is easy to see that an infinitesimal change in the deformation parameter corresponds to a marginal current - current perturbation , @xmath46 from an algebraic perspective it has been argued that this class of deformed su(2 ) models can be described as an orbifold@xcite , @xmath47 however , this is also easy to see by t - dualizing the sigma model for the orbifold@xcite .",
    "the model within the bracket of ( [ su2orbi ] ) has the action @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are coordinates on the coset su(2)/u(1 ) whereas @xmath51 is compactified on a unit circle .",
    "( further , we have employed that @xmath18 and @xmath52 are related by duality . )",
    "now , we t - dualize the @xmath53 direction , and in doing so we will incorporate the @xmath34 orbifold below .",
    "the first step in performing the t - duality is to gauge constant shifts in @xmath54 , i.e.  to introduce a gauge field @xmath55 and replace partial derivatives with covariant ones , @xmath56 next , we constrain the gauge field to be locally pure gauge @xmath57 by adding a lagrange multiplier term @xmath58 to the action , where @xmath59 is the field strength of the gauge field . in order to be able to absorb this pure gauge into a field redefinition of @xmath50 and @xmath51 we have to worry about the global properties of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "following@xcite , we add a topological term @xmath62 and specify that @xmath63 is compactified on a circle with radius @xmath32 , @xmath64 . for a torus worldsheet",
    "the topological term takes the form @xmath65 , where @xmath66 are the winding numbers of @xmath63 around the two cycles of the torus labeled by @xmath67 and @xmath68 . summing over these winding modes results in the constraint that @xmath61 is compactified on a circle of radius @xmath35 . in order , to be able to absorb @xmath61 in a field redefinition we have to shrink the size of the @xmath54 circle in the product model",
    "this is exactly what the orbifoldgroup @xmath34 in ( [ su2orbi ] ) does . finally , integrating out the gauge field instead of @xmath63 provides the t - dual model which is found to be ( [ su2defo ] ) after replacing @xmath69 .",
    "in this section we sketch the orbifold construction for the general case of a semisimple compact group @xmath7 . more details and explicit formul  can be found in@xcite .",
    "again , from algebraic considerations it can be argued that the deformed models are given by an orbifold@xcite , @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the cartan subgroup , @xmath72 the rank of the group @xmath7 and @xmath73 is the constant background on the @xmath72-dimensional torus @xmath74 .",
    "the orbifold group is @xmath75 the action on a representative @xmath76 of the coset @xmath77 for example is @xmath78 where @xmath79 takes values in the weight lattice .",
    "the set of cartan generators can be diagonalized with the eigenvalues being the weights @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) ( @xmath82 is the dimension of @xmath7 ) . if @xmath79 is @xmath32 times a long root the action is trivial since the long root lattice is dual to the weight lattice .",
    "the notation ( [ orbigroup ] ) can be thought of as the analog of defining @xmath34 as @xmath83 mod @xmath32 , whereas ( [ orbiac ] ) is the analog of generating @xmath34 by the @xmath84 root of unity . if we choose the generators of @xmath74 to be the same as the cartan generators of @xmath7 the orbifold acts on @xmath74 as in ( [ orbiac ] ) with @xmath76 replaced by a @xmath74 element .    in order to confirm these statements on a sigma model level , we first take for @xmath77 the vectorially gauged wzw model .",
    "that is , for @xmath85 being an element of the cartan subgroup , we promote the global symmetry @xmath86 of ( [ wzw - model ] ) to a local one by introducing gauge fields @xmath55 transforming as @xmath87 .",
    "next , we add the wzw model action for @xmath74 where , as described above , it is convenient to generate a @xmath74 element @xmath51 by the cartan generators of @xmath7 . for",
    "abelian groups the wzw model does not contain the wz term . on the @xmath74 model we allow , however , for a general background such that its action is @xmath88 with @xmath89 being a non - degenerate @xmath90 constant matrix .",
    "the next step is to perform a t - duality in this product and implement during this process also the orbifold . the global symmetry with respect to which we t - dualize is @xmath91 where @xmath92 is an element of the cartan subgroup of @xmath7 .",
    "this global symmetry is gauged in terms of a gauge field @xmath2 transforming as @xmath93 .",
    "it turns out that gauging the symmetry ( [ tsym ] ) destroys the local gauge invariance under @xmath94 .",
    "( in asymmetrically gauged wzw models , usually a constraint relating the two gauge fields is imposed@xcite . ) here , however , we want to perform a t - duality and have to add a lagrange multiplier term and a topological term ( cf .",
    "( [ constr ] ) and ( [ top ] ) ) . assigning suitable transformation properties to the lagrange multipliers",
    "repairs the vector gauge invariance .",
    "the global properties of the lagrange multipliers are chosen such that they are compactified with respect to the long root lattice .",
    "summing over the corresponding winding modes specifies the global properties of the gauge group with elements @xmath92 such that a pure gauge can be absorbed in a field redefinition if the starting model is the orbifold ( [ genorb ] ) . finally , integrating out the gauge fields @xmath2 ( gauge fix e.g.  @xmath95 ) and the gauge field @xmath55 ( gauge fix e.g.  @xmath96 ) yields the t - dual sigma model @xmath97 where p denotes the projector on the cartan subalgebra , ad@xmath98 the adjoint action with @xmath76 , and @xmath99 .",
    "we observe that the bi - invariant metric and b - field are deformed .",
    "hence , the original @xmath100 chiral / anti - chiral symmetry of the wzw model is broken to @xmath101 . indeed , from ( [ gendefo ] )",
    "one finds the following conserved currents : @xmath102 an infinitesimal change in the deformation parameter changes the action by @xmath103 which corresponds to a marginal current - current operator .",
    "we should also remark that these models have been obtained in a coset description for symmetric @xmath89 in@xcite and for general @xmath89 in@xcite , again with the restriction that the undeformed model is contained only as a limiting case . to conclude this section we discuss the non - trivial dilaton present in all deformed models .",
    "there are several arguments for the source of a non - trivial dilaton .",
    "integrating out gauge fields means solving gaussian integrals which provide a determinant .",
    "on the other hand , when integrating up a marginal perturbation to an exact marginal deformation one should change path integral measures such that they are covariant with respect to the deformed background . in any case , the beta function equations are solved only with a non - trivial dilaton and , indeed , this is one way to compute its form . a more elegant prescription is given in@xcite .",
    "the idea is to compare the physical state condition that the hamiltonian minus some normal ordering constant should annihilate ground states with the wave equation of the corresponding effective target space field .",
    "the wave operator is a second order differential operator on g depending on the target space metric and the dilaton .",
    "the worldsheet hamiltonian on the other hand can be expressed in terms of affine currents@xcite , which act on ground state wave functions as left- and right - invariant vector fields@xcite .",
    "comparing the two operators acting on the ground state wave functions allows to determine the dilaton .",
    "the result is ( for details see@xcite ) that @xmath104 does not change under the deformation .",
    "( here , @xmath105 denotes the dilaton and @xmath7 the determinant of the target space metric . )",
    "we have derived the metric , b - field and dilaton of current - current deformed wzw models for a general semisimple compact group . as in the torus case",
    "the deformation can be viewed as deforming an even selfdual charge lattice@xcite .",
    "hence , the moduli space is : @xmath106 .",
    "since there are additional structures in the model the duality group is the intersection of automorphisms for even selfdual lattices @xmath107 with the selfduality group of the undeformed wzw model which is @xmath108 , where @xmath109 denotes the affine weyl group@xcite .    for the future ,",
    "it is planed to add d - branes which has been studied for the su(2 ) case in@xcite .",
    "another interesting issue might be to add orientifolds .",
    "the action is invariant under worldsheet parity reversal if this is combined with @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is in the center of @xmath7 , and @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , in orientifolds @xmath89 has to be symmetric modulo a duality transformation , i.e.  the b field is quantized . as in the flat case",
    "it should be interesting to study this phenomenon on group manifolds .",
    "further possible extensions are to non - semisimple and non - compact groups .",
