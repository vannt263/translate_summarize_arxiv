    "increased telescope size and improved instrumentation have allowed the observation of ever more distant objects . however even with these improvements the vast majority of extragalactic sources will remain unresolved .",
    "the accurate and reliable analysis of integrated stellar populations is therefore key to our understanding of formation and evolutionary processes in galaxies . through comparisons of these integrated populations with models of homogeneous stellar systems , or",
    "_ single stellar populations _ ( ssps ) , recent studies have met with some success in determining ages and metallicities for both galaxies ( e.g. trager _",
    "et  al . _  2000",
    "; terlevich & forbes 2002 ; maraston _ et  al . _  2003",
    "; proctor _",
    "et  al . _",
    "2004a ; maraston 2005 ; thomas _ et  al . _",
    "2005 ) and extragalactic globular clusters ( e.g. forbes _ et  al . _  2001",
    "; puzia _ et  al . _  2003",
    "; beasley _",
    "et  al . _  2005",
    "; pierce _ et  al . _",
    "2006 ) .",
    "analyses of extragalactic targets have long been dependent on the accurate modelling of stellar populations .",
    "empirical approaches to the modelling of integrated light ( e.g. spinrad & taylor 1971 ) have since given way to more rigorous models dependent on a knowledge of underlying physical processes ( i.e. stellar formation and evolution ) .",
    "these early analyses primarily made use of broadband colours in deriving their age and metallicity measurements .",
    "however , the limitation of broadband colours is that they are degenerately sensitive to age and metallicity ( i.e. old , metal - poor and young , metal - rich populations are photometrically identical ) , heavily restricting the accuracy of ages and metallicities determined using colours alone .",
    "the addition of spectral indices , in particular lick index absorption features ( burstein _ et  al . _  1984 ; trager _ et  al . _",
    "1998 ) , to stellar population models has afforded the much needed leverage to break this degeneracy .",
    "ssp models including lick indices were first assembled by worthey ( 1994 ) , who modelled 21 lick indices and sought to identify those features that were particularly age ( e.g. balmer lines ) or metallicity ( e.g. fe4668 , fe5015 , fe5709 etc . ) sensitive and therefore the most useful for overcoming the observed degeneracy .",
    "more recent works ( e.g. maraston 1998 ; vazdekis 1999 ; bruzual & charlot 2003 ; thomas , maraston & bender 2003 ; thomas , maraston & korn 2004 ; le borgne _ et  al . _  2004",
    "; maraston 2005 ; lee & worthey 2005 ) have focused on including more indices ( i.e. the higher - order balmer lines h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 ) and increasingly complex evolutionary processes ( e.g. mass - loss and horizontal - branch morphology ) .    along these lines",
    ", efforts have also been taken to account for known variations in @xmath0-element abundance ( n , o , mg , ca , na , ne , s , si , ti ) with respect to fe - peak elements ( cr , mn , fe , co , ni , cu , zn ) and their particular effect on lick index measurements .",
    "tripicco & bell ( 1995 ) computed the effects of variation in c , n , o , mg , fe , ca , na , si , cr and ti on the 21 lick indices modelled by worthey ( 1994 ) . these relative index sensitivities were then used by trager _",
    "_  ( 2000 ) to modify the ssps of worthey ( 1994 ) , facilitating the measurement of ages , metallicities _ and _ @xmath0-element abundances for a sample of @xmath340 elliptical galaxies through a comparison of h@xmath4 , mg@xmath5 and @xmath6fe@xmath7 .",
    "subsequent calculations of abundance effects have mimicked the work of tripicco & bell ( 1995 ) , adding sensitivity calculations for higher - order balmer lines ( e.g. houdashelt _ et  al . _  2002",
    "; korn , maraston & thomas 2005 ) and expanding index sensitivities to encompass a broad range of population metallicities ( korn , maraston & thomas 2005 ) .",
    "studies making use of ssps generally compare modelled lick line - strengths to those measured from integrated spectra in order to determine parameters such as age , metallicity and @xmath0-element abundance . to have confidence in the application of these ssps to observations , it is important to confirm that they can reproduce independently determined results from colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and high - resolution stellar spectroscopy .",
    "globular clusters ( gcs ) provide a testbed for ssp models as they represent a coeval and chemically homogeneous stellar population that should , therefore , be analogous to a synthetic single stellar population .",
    "the availability of resolved observations for galactic gcs means that accurate ages and metallicities have already been determined using cmds , while @xmath0-element abundances have been calculated using high - resolution stellar spectra .",
    "such an analysis was carried out by proctor _",
    "et  al . _  ( 2004b ) , who fit a sample of 24 galactic gc spectra from cohen _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1998 ) and puzia _",

    "they found that it was possible to recover the known age , metallicity and @xmath0-element abundance to within @xmath30.1 dex .",
