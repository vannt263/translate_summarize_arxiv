    "graphene is a two - dimensional allotrope of carbon which has become one of the most significant topics in solid state physics due to the large number of applications ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite , bbbb ) .",
    "the carbon atoms form a honey - comb lattice made of two interpenetrating triangular sublattices , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "a special feature of the graphene band structure is the linear dispersion at the dirac points which are dictated by the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands that form conical valleys touching at the high symmetry points of the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "electrons near these symmetry points behave as massless relativistic dirac fermions with an effective dirac - weyl hamiltonian @xcite . when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the graphene sheet ,",
    "a discretization of the energy levels is obtained , the so called landau levels @xcite .",
    "these quantized energy levels still appear also for relativistic electrons , just their dependence on field and quantization parameter is different . in a conventional non - relativistic electron gas , landau quantization produces equidistant energy levels , which is due to the parabolic dispersion law of free electrons . in graphene ,",
    "the electrons have relativistic dispersion law , which strongly modifies the landau quantization of the energy and the position of the levels .",
    "in particular , these levels are not equidistant as occurs in a conventional non - relativistic electron gas in a magnetic field .",
    "this large gap allows one to observe the quantum hall effect in graphene , even at room temperature @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics properties of graphene and graphene nanoribbons have been studied under electric and magnetic modulations from the theoretical and experimental viewpoint ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) the presence of the electric and magnetic modulation expands the landau energy levels into bands and these bandwidths oscillates with the electric and magnetic fields ( weiss oscillation , @xcite ) .",
    "also , magnetic oscillation can be present in the zigzag ribbons . at large width , the low field oscillations for zigzag ribbons is much faster that that of armchair ribbons . in turn , in doped gapped graphene the electronic heat capacity shows the schottky anomaly typical for low temperatures systems @xcite .",
    "following the line of these previous works , this paper is concerned with the exact description of the quantum partition function of a collection of @xmath6 bloch electrons in graphene , in the long wavelength approximation , placed in a constant magnetic field . the classical limit and",
    "the lowest quantum corrections are computed .",
    "we will define a complete @xmath0-body wave function with the antisymmetrized / symmetrized product of a set of single particle wave functions , which are the eigenfunctions of bloch electrons in the long wavelength approximation placed in a magnetic field . in this sense ,",
    "the procedure to define the partition function and the quantum corrections will be identical to the procedure which appears in textbooks ( for example @xcite ) , with the difference that the set of single particle wave functions used in these textbooks are plane waves .",
    "finally , the entropy , internal energy , specific heat and magnetization can be computed for different orders of the partition function .    for a self - contained lecture of this paper ,",
    "a brief introduction of the quantum mechanics of graphene in a constant magnetic field in the long wavelength approximation can be introduced ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian reads@xmath29where @xmath30 .",
    "the low energy description is only valid as long as the characteristic energy of the excitations is not larger than an energy cutoff @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33is a momentum cutoff .",
    "a simple way to choose @xmath34 is by the condition imposed by the linear term in the taylor expansion of the energy , that is , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the lattice spacing .",
    "another slightly different , but more exact way , is by choosing @xmath37 in such a way to conserve the total number of states in the brillouin zone , that is , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is thea area of the hexagonal lattice ( see peres - guinea ) .",
    "then , using eq.([intro5 ] ) , @xmath40 implies that @xmath41 , then for weak magnetic fields , the cutoff tends to infinity and for high magnetic fields , the cutoff tends to zero .    with the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of an electron in graphene we can apply the machinery of statistical mechanics by computing the partition function under succesive permutations .",
    "the work will be organized as follows :    in section 2 , the partition function for @xmath0 bloch electrons will be introduced and computed using the results found in appendix a. a detailed description of the succesive terms of the perturbation expansion is done up to two permutations .",
    "exact results are found for @xmath42 and @xmath43 permutations and for @xmath44 an integral equation is obtained    in section 3 , a comparation for the entropy , internal energy , specific heat and magnetization is shown for @xmath42 and @xmath43 for antisymmetric and symmetric states in the coordinates .",
    "the differences between these thermodynamic functions in terms of temperature are analyzed , showing how the exchange correlation introduce unexpected features in the internal energy and entropy of the quantum system .    in section 4 ,",
    "the conclusions are presented .    in appendix",

    ", the temperature does not appear in eq.([bla3.1.4 ] ) and a thermodynamics limit can not be taken .",
    "nevertheless , a different approximation can be applied , where the graphene sheet area is much larger than the area defined by the magnetic length @xmath62 , that is , @xmath63 , then the interparticle distance @xmath64 can be larger than @xmath62 , this is @xmath65 .",
    "the sum in @xmath54 in last equation contains @xmath66 terms that can be arranged as a sum with increased number of permutations , then we can write @xmath67where @xmath68is a constant with units of area@xmath69 which reads@xmath70and @xmath71 is an index that counts the number of permutations .",
    "the factor @xmath72 contains the sign of odd and even permutations . in the case that the antisymmetric state is contained in the spin variables and not over the coordinates , the factor @xmath73 do not appears in eq.([bla3.1.7 ] ) .",

    "these two results give the statistical repulsion / attraction for fermions in graphene in a constant magnetic field in the limit @xmath80 .",
    "actually , the interparticle potential will vary with the permutation order and can not be disentagled into two - particle potential .     and @xmath81 for continuous line and @xmath82 and @xmath81 for dashed line.,width=396,height=264 ]    in the case of weak magnetic fields , the cutoff tends to @xmath83 , then we can take the limit of large quantum numbers of the statistical potential ( see @xcite , page 1003)@xmath84which differs from the interparticle statistical potential of eq.(9.57 ) of @xcite for the coulomb factor .",
    "an interesting result is that for antisymmetric states in the coordinates , the logarithm function diverges when the argument is zero , which gives the following equation for the minimum distance for the repulsive potential between electrons in the limit of weak magnetic fields and large quantum numbers@xmath85where @xmath86 .",
    "the solution of last equation is @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the lambert @xmath89-function ( see @xcite ) , then @xmath90 .    as a final consideration for this section",

    ", we can consider an intense magnetic field in such a way that the cutoff @xmath154 is @xmath155 .",
    "this implies that @xmath156 which are magnetic fields that can be obtained in laboratory .",
    "in particular , we will consider only two particles , @xmath157 , in this way , the correction to the partition function of eq.([one10.1.1 ] ) gives the total partition function of the system .",
    "using the definition of the thermodynamic functions of eq.([bla1.3.9.2 ] ) we can obtain the entropy , the internal energy , the specific heat and magnetization for a quantum system composed of two bloch electrons in a high magnetic field for symmetric and antisymmetric states in the coordinates . in figure",
    "[ entropy ] , [ energy ] , [ specific heat ] and [ magnetic ] it is shown the results obtained with the partition function @xmath158 ( black line in figures ) and the partition function @xmath159 with the one permutation correction ( red dashed line for antisymmetric states and blue dashed line for symmetric states in figures ) . in all the cases ,",
    "the thermodynamic functions are plotted against temperature in the range from @xmath160 to @xmath161 k.                as it can be seen in figure [ entropy ] , the entropy of the quantum system without interaction between bloch electrons is larger than the entropy of the same system in an anstisymmetric state and lower than the entropy of the same system in a symmetric state in the coordinates . at higher temperatures , both entropies match , which implies that disorder erase the exchange correlation between electrons . at low temperatures ,",
    "the difference between entropies between antisymmetric states and symmetric states can be understood due to the simple fact that there are more symmetric available states than antisymmetric .",
    "the lowest energy value is @xmath162 , which can not support an antisymmetric state because it is zero but it does support a symmetric state .",
    "as we move through the possible energy levels of the composite system , more symmetric than antisymmetric states are available .",
    "in fact , there are @xmath163 symmetric states and @xmath164 antisymmetric states available in the spectrum . in turn",
    ", the internal energy ( see figure energy ) for antisymmetric states is larger than the internal energy of the same system in a symmetric state .",
    "this is related to energy of the lowest antisymmetric state available which is @xmath165 .",
    "the specific heat ( see figure [ specific heat ] )  of both statististics has a limit behavior as @xmath166 , which correspond to entropy saturation due to the upper bound in the energy levels .",
    "but the specific heat of antisymmetric states has a peak , the schottky anomaly , which is related to the larger separation between consecutive energy values available ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the specific heat is computed with doped graphene in a magnetic field . in this case",
    ", the specific heat shows a schottky anomaly , but this is related to the band gap between conduction and valence band introduced by the impurities ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetization ( see figure [ magnetic ] ) shows a typical behavior of a magnetic system , but in this case , the degrees of freedom that make the role of spins are the conduction and valence bands . from the figure ,",
    "the magnetic susceptibility is negative and correspond to the ferromagnetic phase of graphene in a magnetic field .",
    "finally , using the helmholtz free energy , we can obtain the pressure of the thermodynamic system by the following equation @xmath105 , where @xmath106 .",

    "a quantum degeneracy pressure would be expected , but the degeneracy of fermions in graphene in a constant magnetic field introduce an statistical potential that allows fermions to behave as attractive particles at low temperature .    due to the unusual thermal properties of electrons in graphene found in last section when the exchange correlation term is considered in the partition function , where an attractive statistical potential can be obtained",
    ", it would be interesting to study the interaction between graphene - semiconductor junction in the depletion region to see if there is any particular behavior of the schottky barrier .",
    "theoretical and experimental works has been done in this line of work ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we can infer a general result for the succesive terms of the perturbation expansion of the partition function that depends on the factor @xmath171 .",

    "a @xmath175 factor comes from the change of variable @xmath176 , where @xmath98 is due to the center of mass variable integration .",

    "the factor @xmath180 in eq.([gc2.0 ] ) contains the constant @xmath181 which is common for all the terms .",
    "the gauge dependent term @xmath49 prevent us to understand the statistical potential beyond one permutation . in turn",
    ", we can not apply a cluster expansion , where we separate particles that are close together from another cluster because the cosine function in eq.([bla3.1.4 ] ) contains the skew product between position vectors .",
    "the unique possible way in which the argument of the cosine function is zero is only when the particles are aligned , but this is a very specific configuration of particles in graphene sheet . in the case of two permutations ,",
    "the vanishing of the cosine function is translated to the vanishing of the bessel function @xmath182 , where the argument is @xmath183 .",

    "we have shown that at first order , the partition function can be written as a system of @xmath0 bloch electrons with a attractive statistical potential for certain values of the interparticle distance .",
