    "the three important findings by helioseismology are the tachocline , the conical profile in the middle of the convection zone , and the near surface shear layer ( nssl ) .",
    "the physical mechanism underlying these features is discussed in the next section .",
    "the three features show a significant deviation from the expected taylor - proudman state where the angular velocity does not change along the rotational axis .",
    "the strongest deviations from the taylor - proudman state are found in the two boundary layers , the tachocline and the nssl . as shown in fig .",

    "the variation in latitude is not significant in the nssl ( fig .",

    "the existence of the nssl was already inferred before the advent of helioseismology .",
    "@xcite pointed out that magnetic structures rotate 5 % faster than surrounding gas .",
    "then @xcite compared the rotation rate estimated from the doppler velocity measurement and the tracking of the sunspots .",
    "it was found that the rotation rate of the sunspots is consistently faster than the doppler velocity .",
    "this was interpreted as an indication that the sunspots are the anchored in a faster - rotating deeper layer .      according to @xcite , the mean flows in the convection zone",
    "are described by the two equations , which are the gyroscopic pumping and the meridional force balance .",
    "the discussion below is in the spherical geometry @xmath7 .",
    "the gyroscopic pumping is derived from the zonal component of the equation of motion with the anelastic approximation ( @xmath8 ) as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 specify the background density , the meridional flow , and the specific angular momentum . @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath14 specify the fluid velocities at the rotating system and the inertial reference system , respectively , i.e. , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the rotation rate of the system and the zonal unit vector .",
    "the bracket @xmath18 indicates the average in time and zonal direction . in this discussion , the magnetic field and the viscosity are neglected .",
    "then the term @xmath19 is expressed as : @xmath20 where prime indicates the deviation from the axisymmetric temporally averaged value , i.e. , a value is divided as @xmath21 . @xmath19",
    "expresses the angular momentum transport by the reynolds stress , i.e. , the non - linear coupling of the convective flow components .",
    "the gyroscopic pumping equation indicates that when the correlation of the convection flow is determined , the mean meridional flow is determined accordingly in the steady state ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the detailed derivation of the meridional force balance is found in appendix [ twb ] .",

    "the subscript 0 and 1 show the background and perturbed values , respectively .",
    "@xmath28 means the direction of the rotational axis .",
    "the first term expresses the transport and the stretching which includes both contributions of mean flow and turbulent flow ( we call it transport term ) .",
    "the second term shows the coriolis force on the meridional plane and the third is the baroclinic term .",
    "we discuss the nssl with these two equations .",
    "@xcite suggest that when the convection is not influenced much by the rotation , the radial velocity in the thermal convection transports the angular momentum radially inward ( fig .",
    "[ radial_inward ] ) .",
    "when the influence from the rotation is weak and the radial motion conserves the angular momentum , the correlation @xmath29 is negative and transport angular momentum radially inward .",
    "@xcite argued that this is the process for the generation and maintenance of the nssl ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "there have been several attempts to reproduce the nssl based on this assumption @xcite .",
    "@xcite , however , showed that the radially inward angular momentum transport by the reynolds stress is only a necessary condition and that the force balance in the meridional plane must be considered in addition . when the transport term and the baroclinic term in eq .",
    "( [ eq_twb ] ) are neglected , the meridional force balance equation becomes @xmath30 this means that when the radially inward angular momentum transport generates the nssl especially from mid to high latitudes , i.e. , negative @xmath31 , it creates an anti - clockwise meridional flow .",
    "this meridional flow continues to be accelerated and transport the angular momentum , until @xmath31 becomes zero .",
    "thus , in order to obtain a meridional force balance that breaks the taylor - proudman constraint , other terms are necessary to compensate the coriolis force .",
    "for instance , it is thought that the baroclinic term balances the coriolis force within the bulk of the convection zone , which may lead to the conical profile of the solar differential rotation and the structure of the tachocline observed there @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained the solar - like differential rotation with this idea and the assumption that isentropic and isorotational surfaces coincide . regarding the nssl , it is unlikely that the baroclinic term is larger than that in the middle of the convection zone .",
    "even if so , the expected temperature would be 10 k at the surface , which is not seen in observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the transport term could play essential role in maintaining the nssl . in the near surface layer , the convection speed increases and the spatial scale decreases .",
    "indeed , it is expected that the ratio of the rotational period to the convective dynamical time scale ( i.e. , the rossby number ro ) should grow larger in the nssl relative to the low rossby number ( @xmath32 ) convection of the deep interior due to the decreasingly small overturning time of convection near the surface . thus , the reproduction of the nssl in the numerical calculation requires a wide range of spatial and temporal scales , which must include giant cells down to scales smaller than supergranulation .",
    "our previous study of non - rotating global convection was successful in capturing convective scales smaller than supergranulation in the near surface layer using the reduced speed of sound technique ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) . in this study , we include the rotation to reproduce the nssl in the global convection calculation .",
    "the main focus of this paper is to clarify the generation and maintenance mechanism of the nssl in the view of the dynamical balance on the meridional plane as well as the angular momentum transport .",
    "we solve three - dimensional hydrodynamic equations in the spherical geometry @xmath7 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "the numerical model is similar to paper i. we adopt the new expression of reduced speed of sound technique and the equation of state including the partial ionization effect for the sun .",
    "@xmath35 is the cooling term , which is effective only near the surface .",
    "we include the effect of rotation with a rate of @xmath36 , which is the solar rotation rate .",
    "we adopt the same artificial viscosity as @xcite .",
    "the details are shown in appendix [ art ] . the same distribution of @xmath37 is used as paper i , which is defined as : @xmath38 where the adiabatic speed of sound is defined @xmath39 and @xmath40 is adopted .",
    "using this , the reduced speed of sound is @xmath41 at all depth .",
    "the distribution of @xmath37 is shown in fig .",
    "the initial stratification is adiabatic @xmath42 , and a small perturbation is added to the entropy in order to start convection .",
    "the radiative diffusivity is 18 times smaller than that calculated in the model s @xcite ; thus the imposed luminosity is also 18 times smaller than the solar luminosity .",
    "when we use the low viscosity in combination with the solar rotation rate and luminosity , the polar region is accelerated rather than the equator @xcite .",
    "there have been some systematic investigation on the relation between the rossby number and rotation profile .",
    "the formation of the nssl , however , requires the small - scale convection pattern , which can be achieved only with low viscosity .",
    "thus we use the radiative diffusivity to decrease the rossby number in the convection zone until an acceleration of the equator is reproduced .",
    "we implicitly assume that the numerically unresolved thermal convection transports substantial energy in the real sun .",
    "we note that both high resolution and higher position of the top boundary make it difficult to obtain the accelerated equator , since both increase the rossby number and are likely breaking coherent rotationally aligned flows ( `` banana cells '' ) .",
    "thus a rather severe measure is required , i.e. , 18 times smaller luminosity , for achieving a faster rotating equator in this study .",
    "while our setup allows us to generate self - consistently a solar - like differential rotation and a near surface shear layer , we have to be careful when applying our result to the sun .",
    "the resolution is @xmath43 in the yin - yang grid , which is fairly high compared to other calculation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) except for that in paper i. the top and bottom boundaries are at @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "both boundaries are impenetrable and stress free , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "a free boundary condition ( zero gradient ) is adopted for the density and entropy perturbation ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "we use previously calculated data using higher artificial viscosity and old expression of the rsst , i.e. , using @xmath10 instead of @xmath48 , for 4500 days as a initial condition .",
    "then we switch the expression to current equations ( eq .",
    "( [ eqco])-([eqen ] ) ) and reduce the artificial viscosity and calculate it for 200 days . since the changes of differential rotation and meridional flow are not so significant , 200 days calculations are enough for the differential rotation and the meridional flow to reach steady state , in which the time derivative of these large - scale flows are small compared with the other terms .",
    "in order to analyze the data , we continue the simulation for another 200 days .",
    "[ emean]a shows the temporal evolution of the total energy of the differential rotation ( @xmath49 : black ) and the meridional flow ( @xmath50 : blue and @xmath51 : red ) .",

    "rather large time evolution is seen in the total energy @xmath55 ( red line in fig .",
    "[ emean ] ) .",
    "we confirmed that this can be mostly explained with the imbalance of the energy flux between the bottom and the top boundary caused by artificial viscosity on the entropy and the radiative diffusion .",
    "this can be fixed in the future study .",
    "this imbalance corresponds to about 3% of the convective energy flux through the system and potentially influences results on this level .",

    "we note that there were some studies that tried to explain differential rotation through turbulent viscous stresses .",
    "this , however , requires , significantly larger rossby number , i.e. , smaller taylor number , than that expected in the solar convection zone , which was phrased the `` taylor - number puzzle '' in the literature . in this study , this balance between the coriolis force and the inertial force is well achieved in the high latitude . in the low latitude",
    ", the banana cell generates the positive correlation which increases along the radius and accelerates the fluid poleward ( region iii : around the tangential cylinder which is highlighted by circle in fig .",

    "the fluid is accelerated equatorward .",
    "then , the negative correlation becomes zero with approaching the boundary , which then accelerates the fluid poleward again .",
    "this complicated transport of momentum governs the meridional force balance of the nssl at low latitudes .    in this study",
    ", we reduced the solar luminosity to obtain the accelerated equator .",
    "this reduces the convective velocity and the rossby number .",
    "thus the profile of the nssl may be also influenced by the small rossby number compared with the actual sun .",
    "the most important findings in this study are that the angular momentum is transported radially inward in the nssl and that the turbulent viscous stress resulting from the radial gradient of the latitudinal meridional flow , i.e. , @xmath174 , plays an essential role for the maintenance of the nssl .",
    "our difficulties in obtaining a solar - like profile of the nssl in very near surface layer are possibly related to the top boundary condition which forces @xmath61 to go to zero .",
