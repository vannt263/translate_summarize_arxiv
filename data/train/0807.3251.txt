    "the rutile - type dioxides of transition metals ( tmo@xmath1 ) possess a variety of electrical , mechanical , magnetic , and optical properties .",
    "it s electronic structure and electrical properties are widely studied due to their importance in technology .",
    "for example , oso@xmath1 and ruo@xmath1 can be used as a possible electrode material in high - energy - density storage capacitors .",
    "many of the tmo@xmath1s , such as ruo@xmath1 , iro@xmath1 and tio@xmath1 , present a rich phase diagram .",
    "they can transform to other structures under high - pressure conditions .",
    "the first theoretical investigation on the electronic structures of the rutile transition metal dioxides ( oso@xmath1 , iro@xmath1 , and ruo@xmath1 ) , were reported by mattheiss using a non - self - consistent angmented - plane - wave - linear - combinations - of - atomic orbitals method.@xcite subsequently , plenty of theoretical researches , including on the electronic , optical and structural properties were performed for rutile tmo@xmath1 .",
    "et al _ studied the electronic and optical properties of nbo@xmath1 , ruo@xmath1 , and iro@xmath1 using self - consistent calculations based on the linear muffin - tin - orbital method and atomic sphere approximation.@xcite krasovska _ el al _ calculated the optical and photoelectron properties of ruo@xmath1 using the _ ab initio _ self - consistent energy - band structure.@xcite recently , the electronic and optical properties of ruo@xmath1 and iro@xmath1 were reported by first - principles self - consistent electronic structure calculations based on the full - potential linearized plane wave method.@xcite    in addition , the structural and mechanical properties of rutile transition metal dioxides have been widely investigated theoretically and experimentally .",
    "structural phase transitions in iro@xmath1@xcite and ruo@xmath1@xcite were reported based on first - principles calculations .",
    "elastic properties of several potential superhard ruo@xmath1 phases were studied by first - principles plane - wave pseudopotential and full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave methods.@xcite yen _",
    "et al _ measured the first - order raman specta of oso@xmath1 at room temperature.@xcite recently , the lattice dynamics of ruo@xmath1 was given by theory and experiment.@xcite however , to the best of our knowledge , few research on the elastic properties of iro@xmath1 , oso@xmath1 and rho@xmath1 has been reported so far .    in this paper , we focus on investigating the elastic properties of ruo@xmath1 , rho@xmath1 , oso@xmath1 and iro@xmath1 using first - principles calculations based on density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "firstly , their structural parameters are optimized by first - principles total energy calculations .",
    "secondly , the elastic constants are given by finite strain technique under the framework of linear response theory .",
    "then the incompressibility of these tmo@xmath1s are discussed .",
    "finally , the hardness and debye temperature are estimated .",
    "all calculations are performed by the castep code using _ ab initio _",
    "pseudopotentials based on dft . for the exchange - correlation functional the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , as given by perdew , becke , and ernzerhof ( pbe ) , is applied .",
    "all the possible structures are optimized by the bfgs algorithm which provides a fast way of finding the lowest energy structure and supports cell optimization . in the calculation ,",
    "the interaction between the ions and the electrons is described by using vanderbilt s supersoft pseudopotential with the cutoff energy of 380 ev . the monkhorst - pack _ * k*_-point grid with a fine quality brillouin zone sampling of 2@xmath20.04 @xmath3 is used in the calculations . in the geometrical optimization , all forces on atoms",
    "are converged to less than 0.002 ev /  , all the stress components are less than 0.02 gpa , and the tolerance in self - consistent field ( scf ) calculation is 5.0@xmath410@xmath5 ev / atom .",
    "the relaxation of the internal degrees of freedom is allowed at each unit cell compression or expansion .",
    "the elastic constants of tmo@xmath1 are obtained by using the finite strain technique . from the full elastic constant tensor",
    "we determine the bulk modulus @xmath6 , the shear modulus @xmath7 , the young s modulus , @xmath8 , and possion s ratio @xmath9 according to the voigt - reuss - hill ( vrh ) approximation.@xcite",
    "the tetragonal rutile structure belongs to space group @xmath10 .",
    "there are six atoms per unit cell .",
    "two metal atoms locate at ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) sites and four oxygen atoms position at ( @xmath11 , @xmath11 , 0 ) sites , where @xmath11 is the internal parameter .",
    "the metal atoms are surrounded by six oxygen atoms at the corners of a slightly distorted octahedron , while the three metal atoms coordinating each of the oxygen atoms lie in a plane at the corners of a nearly equilateral triangle .",
    "equilibrium volumes , crystal constants , and internal parameters are shown in table i. it can be seen that all the structural parameters optimized here agree well with previous results .",
    "we find that there are very slight differences in volume and internal parameter ( @xmath11 ) between tmo@xmath1s studied .",
    "the calculated elastic constants @xmath12 are given in table ii .",
    "it is easy to see that these constants @xmath12 satisfy the born - huang stability criteria , @xmath13 suggesting that they are mechanically stable . from the elastic constants calculated above",
    ", we obtain the bulk modulus @xmath6 , shear modulus @xmath7 , young s modulus @xmath8 , and possion s ratio @xmath9 and list them in table ii , which are important to understand the elastic properties of tmo@xmath1s . for ruo@xmath1 , our results agree well with the available theoretical and experimental values , indicating that pbe - gga can be used to calculate the elastic properties of tmo@xmath1 . oso@xmath1 and iro@xmath1 have the close bulk moduli and young s moduli , which are higher than those of ruo@xmath1 and rho@xmath1 .",
    "higher bulk modulus indicates strong incompressibility . from table",
    "ii , we conclude that iro@xmath1 and oso@xmath1 are more difficult to be compressed than the two others , meaning that iro@xmath1 and oso@xmath1 are hard solids .",
    "the incompressibility of these tmo@xmath1 can also be seen from relative volume as a function of pressure ( fig .",
    "while there is nt a large difference in the shear modulus at four tmo@xmath1s , it s roughly the same .",
    "also we note that there are few difference ( 13 gpa at most ) between @xmath14 and shear modulus @xmath7 for four dioxides .    employing the correlation between the shear modulus and vickers hardness reported by teter @xcite , the hardness of four tmo@xmath1s is estimated . by using the calculated @xmath7 values reported in table ii and the correlation given by teter we find a theoretical vickers hardness of approximately 14.1 gpa for ruo@xmath1 , 12.3 gpa for rho@xmath1 , 14.8 gpa for oso@xmath1 and 14.6 gpa for iro@xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that the hardness of superhard materials should be higher than 40 gpa , so that tmo@xmath0 are not superhard materials .",
    "possion s ratio reflects the stability of a crystal against shear .",
    "this ratio can formally take values between -1 and 0.5 , which corresponds respectively to the lower limit where the material does not change its shape , and to the upper limit when the volume remains unchanged .",
    "all the calculated poisson s ratios ( table ii ) are bigger than 0.25 , which means that there are strong elastic anisotropy in these tmo@xmath0 . in order to predict the brittle and ductile behavior of solids , puch introduced the ratio of the bulk modulus to shear modulus of polycrystalline phases . a high ( low ) _ b_/_g _",
    "value is associated with ductility ( brittleness ) . the critical value which separates ductile and brittle materials is about 1.75 .",
    "the bigger difference obtained between bulk and shear modulus indicates higher ductility of these tmo@xmath0 ( table ii ) .",
    "now , we discuss the elastic anisotropy of tmo@xmath0 . for the rutile structure , the directional bulk modulus along crystallographic axis and the percent elastic anisotropy defined by chung and buessem are discussed ( table iii ) . from table iii",
    ", it can be seen that the directional bulk modulus is larger along the @xmath15 axis than that along the @xmath16@xmath17 axis , indicating that the incompressibility along the @xmath15 axis is stronger than that along the @xmath16 @xmath17 axis .",
    "this anisotropy of compression along different lattice axis can be clearly seen from the increasing fractional axis compression c / a versus pressure ( fig .",
    "on the other hand , the percentage of elastic anisotropy involves both the percentage anisotropy in compressibility @xmath18 and in shear @xmath19 .",
    "a value of zero represents elastic isotropy and a value of 1 ( 100% ) is the largest possible anisotropy .",
    "the calculated @xmath18 and @xmath19 are listed in table iii .",
    "obviously , these tmo@xmath0s possess strong shear anisotropy and weak bulk anisotropy .",
    "further , the debye temperature @xmath20 is also discussed because the debye temperature relates to many physical properties of materials , such as specific heat , dynamical properties , and melting temperature .",
    "it can be calculated from the average wave velocity @xmath21 by the equation@xcite @xmath22^{1/3}\\upsilon_{m}\\ ] ] where _ h _ is plank s constant , _ k _ is boltzmann s constant , _",
    "n@xmath23 _ is avogadro s number , @xmath24 is density , _",
    "m _ is molecular weight and _ n _ is the number of atom in the molecule . @xmath21",
    "is approximately given by @xmath25^{-1/3}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the transverse and longitudinal elastic wave velocity of the polycrystalline material and are given by navier s equation@xcite @xmath28 and @xmath29 the calculated density , longitudinal , transverse , and average elastic velocities and debye temperatures @xmath20 for four tmo@xmath1s are given in table iv .",
    "debye temperatures @xmath20 of ruo@xmath1 is comparative to the value of 866.4 @xmath30 in reb@xmath0@xcite and ones of oso@xmath1 and iro@xmath1 is comparative to the value of 691 @xmath30 in osn@xmath0.@xcite",
    "in summary , the elastic properties of transition metal dioxides with rutile structure are investigated using first - principles calculations under the framework of density functional theory within generalized gradient density approximation .",
    "elastic constants , bulk modulus , shear modulus , and possion s ratio are given . oso@xmath1 and iro@xmath1 have stronger incompressibility than ruo@xmath1 and rho@xmath1 .",
    "the estimated hardness is 14.1 gpa for ruo@xmath1 , 12.3 gpa for rho@xmath1 , 14.8 gpa for oso@xmath1 and 14.6 gpa for iro@xmath1 , which show that these dioxides are not superhard solids .",
    "debye temperatures calculated by elastic constants and density are 846 k , 795 k , 674 k , 674 k for ruo@xmath1 , rho@xmath1 , oso@xmath1 , and iro@xmath1 , respectively .",
