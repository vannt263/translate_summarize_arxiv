    "recent experiments with radioactive ion beams have opened a new era in nuclear physics by providing the possibility to study the light nuclei far from stability .",
    "indeed , the availability of the radioactive ion beams favored the discovery of halo nuclei @xcite .",
    "a typical example is the neutron halo in the nucleus @xmath0li , revealed as a consequence of its very large interaction radius , deduced from the measured interaction cross sections of @xmath0li with various target nuclei @xcite .",
    "the halo of the nucleus extends its matter distribution to a large radius . a hypothesis based on the early data @xcite about the important role played by the neutron pairing for the stability of nuclei near the drip line",
    "is suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite and , in particular , the direct link of the matter radius to the @xmath2 weak binding in @xmath0li is claimed to be attributed to its configuration as a @xmath3li core coupled to a di - neutron .",
    "the experiments that give evidences of the existence of a halo in this nucleus are related not only to measurements of the total reaction cross section for @xmath0li projectiles but also to the momentum distributions of the @xmath3li or neutron fragments following the breakup of @xmath0li at high energies @xcite , e.g. the process @xmath0li+@xmath4c at @xmath5 mev / nucleon in ref",
    ".  @xcite . here",
    "we will mention also the experiments at lower energies @xmath6 mev / nucleon of scattering of @xmath0li on @xmath3be , @xmath7nb and @xmath8ta in @xcite and of @xmath0li on a wide range of nuclei from @xmath3be to @xmath9u in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the momentum distribution of the breakup fragments has a narrow peak , much narrower than that observed in the fragmentation of well bound nuclei .",
    "this property has been interpreted ( e.g. , @xcite ) to be related to the very large extension of the wave function , as compared to that of the core nucleus , leading to the existence of the nuclear halo . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the longitudinal component of the momentum ( taken along the beam or @xmath10 direction ) gives the most accurate information on the intrinsic properties of the halo and is insensitive to details of the collision and the size of the target .",
    "the differential cross sections for small - angle proton elastic scattering on li isotopes at energies near 700 mev / nucleon were measured in inverse kinematics with secondary nuclear beams at gsi ( darmstadt ) @xcite .",
    "they have been analyzed using the glauber theory and information on the nuclear matter density distributions has been extracted .",
    "it was supposed that the two valence neutrons in @xmath0li , which form the halo , could move in a wide region far from the @xmath3li core that is related to the small two - neutron separation energy ( @xmath11 mev ) .",
    "the idea of existence of two - neutron halo in @xmath0li was experimentally verified in measurements and studies of differential cross sections of the @xmath0li@xmath1 elastic scattering in the energy range 6075 mev / nucleon @xcite .",
    "the data analysis at 62 mev / nucleon @xcite showed that the adjusted phenomenological woods - saxon ( ws ) potential has a shallow real part and an imaginary part with a long tail . in refs .",
    "@xcite the data at 6575 mev / nucleon were analyzed using the parameter free cluster - orbital shell - model approximation ( cosma ) @xcite and a conclusion was drawn that the @xmath0li@xmath1 scattering is mainly determined by scattering on the @xmath3li core . in various works ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) the calculations of the @xmath0li@xmath1 differential cross sections in the energy range @xmath12 mev / nucleon differ between themselves by the assumptions how the @xmath0li@xmath1 optical potential to be constructed .",
    "most of them use the simple folding approach to the real part of op ( reop ) without accounting for the exchange terms and with introducing different forms of effective nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions . to calculate the folding potentials ,",
    "the constituent @xmath3li+@xmath2 cluster model was usually employed , in which the @xmath0li density has two separated parts taken in explicit forms .",
    "various suggestions were made for the imaginary part of op ( imop ) like ws and gaussian forms or calculated within the @xmath13-matrix method .",
    "then , the cross sections were computed numerically by using the eikonal approximation or starting with the glauber multiple scattering theory . the more complicated model of @xmath0li treated as a @xmath3li+n+n three - body system was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the effects of the halo distribution in @xmath0li in correspondence to different parts of the three - body wave function are manifested in the elastic cross section .",
    "generally , here we would like to outline the advantages of the microscopic analyses using the coordinate - space @xmath14-matrix folding method ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , as well as works ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where the reop is microscopically calculated using effective nn interactions within a folding approach @xcite and including also the exchange terms in it . in the recent works @xcite the @xmath0li@xmath1 elastic scattering cross sections",
    "were analyzed using folding procedure and effective nn forces to calculate the real op taking into account only its direct part but not the exchange one . in ref .",
    "@xcite the volume imop was taken either in a ws form or in the form of the direct folded reop and in ref .",
    "@xcite an application of the microscopic op @xcite developed on the base of the hea theory @xcite was also made . to this end",
    "phenomenological densities ( gaussian - types and cosma ) have been used in the calculations @xcite and the lssm densities of @xmath15li @xcite in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well .",
    "the aims of our work can be presented as follows .",
    "first , we study elastic scattering cross section for @xmath0li@xmath1 at three incident energies ( @xmath12 mev / nucleon ) using microscopically calculated op s within the hybrid model @xcite .",
    "the reop includes the direct and exchange terms and the imop is based on the hea .",
    "we follow our previous works @xcite , where this model was applied to elastic scattering of exotic nuclei @xmath16he with use of their lssm densities , and thus avoiding an adjustment of free parameters . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we pay attention to the ambiguity problem when fitting the coefficients @xmath17 s that renormalize the strengths of different parts of op .",
    "this ambiguity is minimized in ref .",
    "@xcite by testing the condition that the true energy dependence of the volume integrals must fulfill .",
    "second , in addition to the analysis of elastic scattering cross sections , we estimate other characteristics of the reaction mechanism such as the @xmath0li total reaction and breakup cross sections . the theoretical scheme used in this second part of the work",
    "is based on the procedure from the first part to calculate microscopically the potentials necessary for the evaluation of the other quantities within the model .",
    "the calculations are performed by using the @xmath0li+@xmath18 op constructed as a sum of the microscopically calculated op of @xmath3li+@xmath18 and the ( @xmath2-halo)+@xmath18 potential folded with a density probability of the relative motion of clusters . for a more consistent description of the halo structure of @xmath0li",
    "we calculate the fragment momentum distributions from @xmath0li@xmath1 reaction at 62 mev / nucleon within the same breakup reaction model and present predictions for them .",
    "finally , we give results for the single - particle density distribution of @xmath0li within the true two - cluster model considering the relative motion of clusters ( @xmath3li+@xmath19 ) that is ensured by the respective wave function and make a comparison with other calculations .",
    "the structure of this article is the following .",

    "@xcite how the isovector part of the exchange reop can be obtained . here",
    "we would like to emphasize the general importance of the account for the exchange part of the op . as shown on different examples in ref .",
    "@xcite , the exchange effects lead , for instance , to a particular energy dependence of the total potential , to different signs of the direct and exchange inelastic form factors and others , so they should be treated as accurately as possible .    the lssm proton and neutron densities used in our work for @xmath0li are calculated in a complex 2@xmath37 shell - model space using the ws basis of single - particle wave functions with exponential asymptotic behavior @xcite , which is in principle the realistic one .",

    "this difference can affect the results for the cross sections in the region of relatively large angles of scattering .",
    "this point was one of the reasons the lssm densities @xcite for @xmath15li to be used in our work .      in the present work we use the hybrid model of op @xcite , in which its imaginary part was derived within the hea theory @xcite , while the real part is obtained as prescribed by the folding procedure from sec .",
    "the cross sections are calculated by means of the dwuck4 code @xcite for solving the schrdinger equation . to obtain the hea op one can use the definition of the eikonal phase as an integral of the nucleon - nucleus potential over the trajectory of the straight - line propagation , and has to compare it with the corresponding glauber expression for the phase in the optical limit approximation . in this way",

    "@xcite , where the deduced halo radius @xmath231 fm is larger than the core radius @xmath230 fm by a factor of more than 2 .",
    "however , the ambiguity remains in the choice of the `` best '' density distribution of @xmath0li because only the @xmath0li@xmath1 elastic scattering data are not sufficient .",

    "the results of the present work can be summarized as follows :    \\(i ) in the first part of the work ( sec .",
    "ii ) the microscopic optical potentials and cross sections of @xmath0li@xmath1 elastic scattering were calculated at the energies of 62 , 68.4 , and 75 mev / nucleon and were compared with the available experimental data .",
    "the direct ( @xmath238 ) and exchange ( @xmath239 ) parts of the real op ( @xmath59 ) were calculated using the folding procedure with density - dependent m3y ( cdm3y6-type ) effective interaction based on the paris @xmath240 potential .",
    "the imaginary part of op ( @xmath60 ) was calculated microscopically within the folding model based on the high - energy approximation .",
    "the lssm densities @xcite of protons and neutrons with exponential asymptotic behavior of @xmath0li that is the correct one were used in the calculations .",
    "the spin - orbit contribution to the op was also included in the calculations . the @xmath0li@xmath1 elastic scattering cross sections and the total reaction cross sections",
    "were calculated using the program dwuck4 @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) we pointed out that the regularization of our microscopic op s is achieved by introducing the fitting parameters @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 related to the `` depths '' of the separate parts of op .",
    "they are , in principle , the only free parameters of our approach , in contrast to other phenomenological ones and serve as a quantitative test of the latter , i.e. the proximity of @xmath17 s values to unity shows the closeness of the approach to the reality .",
    "however , here the `` ill - posed '' problem takes place because the fitting procedure is applied to a limited number of experimental data .",
    "the problem of the ambiguity of the @xmath17 s parameters have been considered in our previous works @xcite .",
    "we used in the present work a physical constraint on the choice of the values of the @xmath17 s parameters , namely the known behavior of the volume integrals @xmath92 and @xmath93 as functions of the incident energy for @xmath204 mev / nucleon @xcite .",
    "we compare the behavior of the values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 obtained in our work with those in the semi - phenomenological approach in ref .",
    "@xcite , where much more parameters have been used than in our microscopic method .",
    "we discuss in more details the problem arising from the behavior of @xmath93 at @xmath80 mev / nucleon and relate it to the quality of the data at larger angles ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "we note that this problem had appeared also in @xcite .",
    "finally , we obtained a definite set of the fitted @xmath17 s parameters that give satisfactory agreement of our results with the data of elastic @xmath0li@xmath1 scattering cross section using the physical criterion of the behavior of the volume integrals as functions of the energy .",
    "\\(iii ) we would like to mention that the values of the total cross sections of scattering and reaction can serve as another physical criterion for the @xmath17 s values .",
    "however , the corresponding experimental data for these values are missing at the energy interval considered in our work , so they are highly desirable .",
    "\\(iv ) as in our previous works @xcite , we would like to emphasize that a more successful explanation of the cross section data could be given by accounting for virtual excitations of inelastic and decay channels of the reaction .",
    "for this reason , in sec .",
    "iii of the present paper , apart from the usual folding model based on the lssm , we consider another folding approach that includes @xmath0li breakup suggesting a simple @xmath3li+2@xmath116 cluster model for its structure . both lssm and cluster models of @xmath0li are capable to reproduce fairly well the two - neutron separation energy from @xmath0li . in sec .",
    "iii we use the procedure from the first part of our work ( sec .",
    "ii ) for microscopic calculations of the necessary op s in the breakup model for estimations of the elastic scattering cross sections , as well as of the momentum distributions in the processes of the proton scattering on clusters and the corresponding @xmath241-functions in @xmath3li@xmath1 and @xmath19+@xmath18 scattering .",
    "the folding op s calculated in the two parts of our work behave rather closely if one fits their strengths to the same elastic scattering data , as it is done for @xmath0li@xmath1 at energy 62 mev / nucleon .",
    "thus , the analysis of other types of the reaction mechanism , such as the @xmath0li breakup , makes it possible to understand their significant role in the formation of the op responsible for the @xmath0li@xmath1 elastic scattering .",
    "it turns out that the breakup channel gives @xmath200 that exceeds 80% from @xmath201 , while it is around a half of @xmath201 in the case of @xmath111he+@xmath4c ( as obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "\\(v ) in the present work we give also predictions for the longitudinal momentum distributions of @xmath3li fragments produced in the breakup of @xmath0li at 62 mev / nucleon on a proton target .",
    "we calculated the diffraction and stripping ( when the cluster @xmath2 leaves the elastic channel ) cross sections of the reaction of @xmath0li on proton target at energy 62 mev / nucleon .",
    "we note that our breakup gives the width of the peak between 70 and 80 mev / c , while the widths of about 50 mev / c are known from the reactions of @xmath0li on nuclear targets @xmath3be , @xmath7nb and @xmath8ta at energy 66 mev / nucleon . in relation with this , here we should mention that at the energy of the range 60 - 70 mev / nucleon a distortion due to the nuclear and coulomb forces could affect the cross sections .",
    "we have in mind also that our simplified two - cluster model could not give the correct answer and that it can be found in a more complicated three - body approach .",
    "hence , this problem remains open and requires further analysis .",
    "we emphasize the necessity of experiments on stripping and diffraction reactions of @xmath0li on proton targets at energy @xmath12 mev / nucleon .",
    "\\(vi ) we present results for the single - particle density distribution of @xmath0li in the framework of a cluster model .",
    "our calculated density is close to the phenomenological one obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by fitting to the experimental differential cross sections of scattering of @xmath0li at 700 mev / nucleon on a proton target . from a physical point of view",
    "the cluster model allows more clear interpretation of the experimental data and together with the phenomenological densities can be applied as a pattern density to fit the data .",
    "future measurements of the cross sections for proton elastic scattering and momentum distribution of the @xmath3li fragments in the @xmath0li breakup reactions might provide supplemental information on the internal spatial structure of the @xmath0li nucleus .",
