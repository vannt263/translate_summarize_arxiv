    "accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems ranging from new - born stars to compact objects , like white dwarfs , neutron stars and black holes , both stellar and galactic . due to their high temperatures and large surface areas ,",
    "disks appear to be among the most luminous objects in the universe .",
    "strong dissipative processes which accompany accretion around compact objects can eleviate the radiation energy density in and above the disk , leading naturally to radiation - driven winds , similar to winds from hot stars .",
    "observational signatures of such winds have been unambigously detected in cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) ( heap  et  al .  1978 ; krautter  et  al .  1981 ; klare  et  al .",
    "1982 ; crdova & mason 1982 ) and in active galactic nuclei , hereafter agns ( arav , shlosman , & weymann 1997 , and refs .  therein ) , but their understanding proved to be challenging for theorists . in this and the following paper ( feldmeier , shlosman , & vitello 1999 ; hereafter paper  ii ) we focus on different aspects of disk winds in cvs , such as their 2-d geometry , solution topology , mass loss rates and velocity profiles .",
    "agn disks will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "theoretical understanding of winds from accretion disks is hampered by their intrinsically multi - dimensional character and by the richness of various physical processes supplementing the basic hydrodynamics of the flow .",
    "a number of different driving mechanisms for disk winds have been predicted and analyzed , from magnetic torques to x - ray disk irradiation ( i.e. , compton - heated and thermally - driven winds ) to resonance line pressure ( e.g. , blandford & payne 1982 ; begelman , mckee , & shields 1983 ; crdova & mason 1985 ; woods  et  al .",
    "disks in non - magnetic cvs with high accretion rates , @xmath2 , have an energy output which peaks in the ( far-)ultraviolet , similarly to o , b and wr  stars .",
    "their spectra exhibit features which bear similarity to those found in hot and massive stars , and which are attributed to winds driven by radiation pressure in resonance and subordinate lines of abundant chemical elements , so - called line - driven winds ( ldws ) .",
    "observational evidence in favor of ldws winds from hot stars and disks includes but is not limited to the p  cygni line profiles of c  iv , n  v and si  iv , ionization levels , high terminal velocities and their correlation with the luminosity , and uv line behavior during continuum eclipse in cvs .",
    "pioneering works by lucy & solomon ( 1970 ) , castor ( 1974 ) and castor , abbott , & klein ( 1975 ; cak in the following ) have shown that o  star winds result from scattering of radiation in the resonance lines of abundant elements .",
    "elegantly formulated theory of the ldws from o  stars by cak , cassinelli ( 1979 ) , abbott ( 1980 , 1982 ) , pauldrach , puls , & kudritzki ( 1986 ) and others ( for a textbook account , see lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) , was successfully applied to individual objects .",
    "further refinements of this theory by owocki & rybicki ( 1984 , 1985 ) and owocki , castor , & rybicki ( 1988 ) addressed the issue of stability of the flow .",
    "first application of the ldws to accretion disks ( shlosman , vitello , & shaviv 1985 ; vitello & shlosman 1988 ) emphasized the non - spherical ionizing continuum and driving force as well as a bi - conical geometry of the outflow . under a broad range of conditions disk atmospheres in cvs and agns become dynamically unstable because the line opacity effectively brings them into a super - eddington regime .",
    "continuum photons absorbed by the uv resonance lines and re - emitted isotropically contribute to the momentum transfer to the wind .",
    "this process can be described as a resonant scattering which conserves the number of photons throughout the wind and results in terminal wind velocities of the order of the escape speed at the base of the flow .",
    "the dynamics and radiation field of disk ldws employed by shlosman  et  al .",
    "( 1985 ) and by vitello & shlosman ( 1988 ) were oversimplified .",
    "both were approximated by a 1-d planar model allowing for divergence of the flow streamlines and geometrical dilution of the radiation field .",
    "nineteen resonance lines in the range of @xmath3  were included in the calculation of the self - consistent radiation force .",
    "it was noted that disk ldws are more restrictive than stellar winds and their development is strongly governed by the ionization structure in the wind .",
    "subsequently , a variety of 2-d kinematical models for disk winds in cvs supplemented by a 3-d radiation transfer in the sobolev approximation were explored ( shlosman & vitello 1993 ; vitello & shlosman 1993 ) .",
    "calculations using an alternative monte carlo radiation transfer method , albeit with frozen - in ionization , gave similar results ( knigge , woods , & drew 1995 ) .",
    "constrained by synthetic line profiles and by calculated effects of varying basic physical parameters , such as accretion and mass loss rates , temperature of the boundary layer , rotation , and inclination angle , the available phase space for wind solutions was sharply reduced .",
    "wind resonant scattering regions exhibiting a strongly bi - conical character regardless of the assumed velocity and radiation fields were identified and mapped .",
    "this allowed to match the observed line shapes from a number of cvs and to put forward a number of predictions , which were verified in high - resolution hst observations ( shlosman , vitello , & mauche 1996 ; mauche  et  al .",
    "most importantly , rotation was positively identified as the dominant factor shaping the uv line profiles in cvs confirming that the disk and not the white dwarf is the wind source .",
    "the above 1-d dynamical and 2-d kinematical modelings suffered from uniqueness problems which can be removed only by invoking the 2-d dynamics .",
    "recent successful attempts by proga , stone , & drew ( 1998 ; psd hereafter ) to model the 2-d time - dependent radiation hydrodynamics of disk ldws was a major breakthrough in our understanding of this phenomenon .",
    "( the model of murray & chiang 1996 for cv winds , on the other hand , does not provide specifics for the wind geometry and hence we avoid discussing it here . )",
    "it confirmed basically that kinematical models of disk winds have sampled the correct parameter range and provided the scaling laws between different wind characteristics , e.g. , between mass loss rate and accretion luminosity , and delineated the phase space for possible time - dependent solutions .",
    "a number of empirical relationships were put forward which require a physical explanation .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the 2-d geometry of a disk ldw in the presence of a realistic radiation field in cvs .",
    "we analyze solutions of the wind euler equation , emphasising differences in the solution topology with that of cak stellar winds . in the subsequent paper  ii we address issues related to the mass loss rates and velocity laws of cv winds . the possible contribution to wind - driving by magnetic stresses",
    "is ignored here ( e.g. , blandford & payne 1982 ; pudritz & norman 1986 ; emmering , blandford , & shlosman 1992 ) , as are jet - like outflows seen in other disk systems ( livio 1997 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ caktheoryforostars ] reviews the relevant aspects of cak theory for ldws from o  stars .",
    "section  [ diskwindgeometry ] addresses the 2-d geometry of disk ldws , as well as the radiation field above the cv disk .",

    "section  [ discussion ] compares our results with other models and observations , and section  [ summary ] summarizes our work .",
    "the cak theory for line - driven winds from o  stars forms the basis for our model of cv winds , and is therefore briefly summarized here .",
    "cak assume a line - distribution function per unit @xmath4 and @xmath5 , from uv to ir , @xmath6 where @xmath4 is the line frequency and @xmath5 [ @xmath7 the mass absorption coefficient normalized to @xmath8 , where the latter refers roughly to the strongest driving line in the flow ( owocki  et  al .",
    "for the power exponent , @xmath9 holds , where the lower limit corresponds to purely optically thin lines , and the ( unrealistic ) upper limit to purely optically thick lines .",
    "puls , springmann , & lennon  ( 1999 ) derive @xmath10 from kramers formula applied to resonance lines of hydrogenic ions .",
    "similar values of @xmath11 are obtained from detailed nlte calculations for dense o  supergiant winds ( pauldrach 1987 ; pauldrach  et  al .",

    "the euler equation in the form ( 7 ) is particularly simple and its terms have a straightforward physical meaning , namely inertia , gravity and line force .",
    "we now consider solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eulercakfull ] ) with finite @xmath30 . according to cak , for sufficiently large values of @xmath38 there are two solutions in the supersonic regime , @xmath49 , termed ` shallow ' ( small @xmath50 ) and ` steep ' ( large @xmath50 ) solutions , whereas in the subsonic",
    ", photospheric regime , @xmath51 , only the shallow solutions exist . on the other hand ,",
    "only the steep solutions reach infinity .",
    "namely , the term @xmath52 ( the thermal pressure force due to geometrical expansion ) becomes infinite for @xmath53 , and must be balanced by @xmath54 along the branch of steep solutions .",
    "cak concluded therefore that the true , unique wind solution has to switch from the shallow to the steep branch at a ` critical ' point ( see fig .",
    "[ caktopology ] ) . of course , a non - zero pressure term at infinity is unphysical because it requires an infinite amount of energy in the flow and is purely a result of the imposed isothermal conditions in the wind .",
    "the subsonic region has an extent of a few percent of the stellar radius for o  star winds , while the pressure force @xmath52 becomes important only beyond a few @xmath55 . in the intermediate regime ,",
    "i.e. , almost everywhere , the simplified eq .",
    "( [ eulercakzerosoundspeed ] ) with @xmath56 holds to a good approximation , and therefore @xmath57 .",
    "this happens since both gravity and line force are @xmath58 .",
    "solution curves in the @xmath59 plane are essentially straight lines , bending over due to thermal pressure both at @xmath60 and 0 . as a result ,",
    "the critical point is a saddle point in the @xmath59 plane ( bjorkman 1995 ) .",
    "the usual mathematical definition of a critical point refers , however , to the @xmath61 plane or a topologically equivalent plane .    for @xmath44 ,",
    "the critical point lies on an extended ridge , and its position becomes ill - defined ( fig .",
    "[ caktopology]a ) . in this limit ,",
    "_ every _ point of the critical solution is a critical point . for @xmath62 , however , cak find the critical point to lie at @xmath63 ( fig .",
    "[ caktopology]b ) .",
    "inclusion of further correction terms to the line force , especially due to the finite size of the stellar disk , breaks the @xmath64 dependence of the line force , pushes the two almost degenerate critical solutions @xmath65 apart , and shifts the critical point towards the sonic point ( fig .  [ caktopology]c ) .",
    "pauldrach  et  al .",
    "( 1986 ) find then @xmath66 .    a critical point is the information barrier for ldws , and plays a role similar to the sonic point in thermal winds or nozzle flows ( abbott 1980 ) .",
    "how can the pressure mismatch of a shallow solution at @xmath67 be communicated upstream to the critical point at @xmath68 ?",
    "we speculate that it is not really the outer boundary mismatch which forces the flow through a critical point .",
    "instead , the truly distinguishing property of the critical solution should be its correspondence to the _ maximum _ mass loss rate in the wind .",
    "work is underway to identify the feedback mechanism between the wind and the photosphere which drives the wind from any shallow to the unique critical solution .",
    "this issue will be addressed elsewhere . in the present paper ,",
    "we _ assume _ that the true disk wind solution is the one with the maximal allowable mass loss rate .",
    "additional justification comes from the fact that only the shallow solutions for the disk wind connect to the disk photosphere . however , their terminal speeds are much smaller than the white dwarf escape speed , in sharp contrast to observed cv winds .",
    "the solution we are searching for should therefore switch to the steep branch ( with large @xmath48 ) at some critical point , i.e. , should be the solution of maximum mass loss rate .",
    "the flow critical point ( subscript ` c ' ) is defined by the singularity condition , @xmath69 ( i.e. , merging of a shallow and a steep solution ) . together with the euler equation , this implies    @xmath70    the eigenvalue @xmath43 determines the maximum mass loss rate , and @xmath71 determines the terminal speed .",
    "they are further discussed in paper  ii .",
    "furthermore , from the euler equation , @xmath72 , also @xmath73 must hold everywhere .",
    "this leads to the regularity condition , @xmath74 ( if @xmath75 ) , which determines the position of the critical point .",
    "the central assumption throughout this paper is that the helical streamline of a fluid parcel in the wind is contained within a _ straight _ cone .",
    "while this is certainly an idealization , and a major restriction of this model , justifaction comes firstly from the related kinematical model of shlosman & vitello ( 1993 ) ; and secondly from the numerical 2-d hydrodynamic simulations of psd , which showed that the escaping mass - loss carrying streamlines are well approximated by straight lines in the @xmath76 plane , @xmath77 and @xmath78 being cylindrical coordinates .",
    "we denote the angle between the wind cone and the radial direction @xmath79 in the disk plane by @xmath80 .",
    "this angle is calculated self - consistently using the euler equation , and is not assumed _ a priori_. the footpoint radius of a streamline in the disk is @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is the distance along the cone ( cf .",
    "[ windcoordinates ] ) .",
    "we search for the solutions of the euler equation in the @xmath83 $ ] plane , for a streamline starting at arbitrary @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath84 dependence leads to the appearance of a new eigenvalue problem for the disk wind , and derivation of this function is the focus of the present paper .",
    "since ldws are highly supersonic , we neglect the pressure forces , and furthermore assume that the azimuthal velocity is determined by angular momentum conservation above the disk , and by keplerian rotation in the disk plane . the tilt angle @xmath80 has to be a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath81 to avoid streamline crossing , which would violate the assumption of a pressureless gas .",
    "the only remaining velocity component is @xmath85 , which points upwards along the cone .",
    "the dynamical problem has therefore been reduced to solving the euler equation for @xmath85 .    in",
    "a frame rotating with the angular velocity @xmath86 of a fluid parcel positioned at radius vector @xmath87 , there are three fictitious forces ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the coriolis acceleration , @xmath88 , has no component along @xmath89 , and the same is true for the inertial force of rotation , @xmath90 .",
    "we introduce the effective gravity function , which is the component of gravity minus centrifugal force along the straight line in direction @xmath89 , and is given by @xmath91 , with @xmath92 being the mass of the white dwarf , and @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in the following ,",
    "all lengths written in capital letters are normalized to the footpoint radius , @xmath81 , in the disk .",

    "equation  ( [ normalizedgravity ] ) shows an important difference between stellar and disk winds .",
    "the stellar gravity is always decreasing with distance , while for the disk an effective gravity ` hill ' must be overcome before the wind can escape .",
    "this effect of disk ldws will be discussed in section  [ tiltedwinds ] .",
    "next , we evaluate the line force in eq .",
    "( [ lineforcegeneral ] ) . besides the initial growth of effective gravity with height ,",
    "the opacity - weighted flux integral is the central property which distinguishes disk winds from stellar winds .",
    "pereyra , kallman , & blondin  ( 1997 ) give an analytical approximation for this integral above an isothermal disk .",
    "unfortunately , an error was introduced with a change of integration variable , which led to an artificial , linear dependence of the vertical flux on @xmath78 , even as @xmath104 .",
    "psd solve this integral numerically ( cf . icke 1980 ) , using approximately 2,000 gaussian integration points .    in the general spirit of the radial streaming approximation of cak , we replace the integral in eq .",
    "( [ lineforcegeneral ] ) by @xmath105 , thus introducing an _ equivalent _ optical depth , @xmath106 .",

    "generally , of course , accretion disks are not isothermal .",
    "we , therefore , consider two complementary cases with @xmath116 ( termed ` newtonian ' disk in the following ) and @xmath117 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; shs hereafter ) .",
    "observations show that the brightness temperature stratification of cv disks is consistent with both these distributions ( horne & stiening 1985 ; horne & cook 1985 ; rutten  et  al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "for the newtonian disk , we find @xmath118 where @xmath119    the surface flux above the shs disk can only be integrated numerically , from eq .",
    "( [ fluxring ] ) . yet",
    ", this has the advantage that @xmath106 can be introduced for each ring individually .",
    "more specifically , @xmath106 is calculated along the flux direction of a given ring at the position of the wind parcel . if the flux ( [ fluxrsq ] ) is used instead , @xmath106 is calculated along the disk flux direction .",

    "this is due to the increasing visibility of the inner , hot disk regions .",
    "we denote this regime , where the flux has a maximum , the ` panoramic ' regime , to be distinguished from the planar ` disk ' regime , where @xmath126 , and the ` far field ' regime , where @xmath127 .",

    "however , limb darkening can be more important in the uv spectral regime due to the wien part of the spectrum , and the correction factors could become somewhat larger there ( diaz , wade , & hubeny  1996 ) .",

    "the outer disk region , at radii @xmath228 , exhibits a time - dependent irregular flow , resulting in no mass loss .",

    "interestingly , our outer wind seems to be more robust than the inner wind . for the latter ,",
    "the balance of driving and drag forces which leads to a high saddle on the far side of the gravity hill is rather a delicate one .",
    "setting , for example , the centrifugal force _ arbitrarily _ to zero causes the high saddle solution to vanish , whereas the low saddle remains almost unchanged .",
    "psd suggest that the irregular behavior of the outer flow is a consequence of the different @xmath125-dependence of gravity and disk flux , with the gravity preventing the wind from developing .",
    "we find instead that at radii @xmath194 , where a low saddle exists , the fast increase in the projected disk flux , @xmath229 , results in a sufficiently strong growth of the line force which drives the wind past the gravity hill .",
    "for the inner wind regions , on the other hand , where no lower saddle branch exists , the wind indeed must overcome the gravity barrier without the appropriate radiation flux increase with @xmath125 .",
    "based on our analysis of the disk wind we may provide some insight into the erratic behavior of the flow psd observe at larger radii .",
    "it is possible that mass overloading of the flow causes spatial and temporal fluctuations of the streamline divergence @xmath165 , wherefore the wind stalls on characteristic length scales of the vertical gravity , @xmath81 .",
    "we conjecture that fluctuations on such scales may be self - amplifying , or , in other words , result in a locally converging flow with @xmath230 .",
    "however , if such an instability exists , it is expected to be most pronounced in the inner disk regions .",
    "namely , with increasing @xmath81 , the flux increases faster with @xmath125 , which moves the critical point closer to the sonic point .",
    "mass overloading seems therefore less likely in the outer wind regions , in contrast to the findings of psd .",
    "a linear stability analysis of our stationary wind model with respect to harmonic perturbations of @xmath165 would also be interesting , but is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "furthermore , we can not confirm the dependence of @xmath80 on the disk luminosity as in the psd model .",
    "we find that the eigenvalue @xmath120 for each streamline is determined from the positions of the saddle points of the function @xmath186 .",
    "both @xmath100 and @xmath178 are independent of the disk luminosity , @xmath178 specifically so because it is normalized to the flux at the streamline footpoint ( eq .  [ ffunctioneq ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath120 depends only on the radial temperature stratification in the disk .",
    "one important issue neglected in our modeling is the saturation of the line force at some value when all the driving lines become optically thin .",
    "if this thick - to - thin transition occurs before the flow reaches its critical point , the wind solution is lost , since the drag forces overcome the driving forces . however ,",
    "this still leaves the possibility that a more complicated wind dynamics is established , where the decelerating flow at some larger radius starts again to accelerate ( i.e. , jumps from a @xmath231 to a @xmath232 solution ) .",

    "this proximity of the sonic and critical points may not be coincidental , and one can speculate whether or not the _ sonic _ point determines the mass loss rate instead of the critical point . however , we find for the disk wind model that the sonic and critical points occasionally lie far apart , e.g. , for a vertical wind above an isothermal disk , or a tilted wind close to the rotation axis ( ` inner wind ' ) .",

    "the latter flux maximum appears to be a crucial factor in allowing the wind to pass over the gravity ` hill ' .",

    "the critical point of the outer wind lies close to the disk photosphere and to the sonic point .",

    "<S> we analyze the dynamics of 2-d stationary , line - driven winds from accretion disks in cataclysmic variable stars . </S>",
    "<S> the driving force is that of line radiation pressure , in the formalism developed by castor , abbott , & klein for o  stars . </S>",
    "<S> our main assumption is that wind helical streamlines lie on straight cones .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the euler equation for the disk wind has two eigenvalues , the mass loss rate and the flow tilt angle with the disk . </S>",
    "<S> both are calculated self - consistently . </S>",
    "<S> the wind is characterized by two distinct regions , an _ outer _ </S>",
    "<S> wind launched beyond four white dwarf radii from the rotation axis , and an _ inner _ wind launched within this radius . </S>",
    "<S> the inner wind is very steep , up to @xmath0 with the disk plane , while the outer wind has a typical tilt of @xmath1 . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the ray dispersion is small . </S>",
    "<S> we , therefore , confirm the bi - conical geometry of disk winds as suggested by observations and kinematical modeling . </S>",
    "<S> the wind collimation angle appears to be robust and depends only on the disk temperature stratification . </S>",
    "<S> the flow critical points lie high above the disk for the inner wind , but close to the disk photosphere for the outer wind . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with existing kinematical and dynamical models is provided . </S>",
    "<S> mass loss rates from the disk as well as wind velocity laws are discussed in a subsequent paper . </S>"
