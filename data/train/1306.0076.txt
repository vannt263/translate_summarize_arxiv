    "invariance principles for random walks in @xmath0-dimensional reversible random environments date back to the 1980s @xcite .",
    "the most robust of the early results in this area concerned scaling limits for the annealed law , that is , the distribution of the random walk averaged over the possible realizations of the environment , or possibly established a slightly stronger statement involving some form of convergence in probability . studying",
    "the behavior of the random walks under the quenched law , that is , for a fixed realization of the environment , has proved to be a much more difficult task , especially when there is some degeneracy in the model .",
    "this is because it is often the case that a typical environment has ` bad ' regions that need to be controlled .",
    "nevertheless , over the last decade significant work has been accomplished in this direction .",
    "indeed , in the important case of the random walk on the unique infinite cluster of supercritical ( bond ) percolation on @xmath1 , building on the detailed transition density estimates of @xcite , a brownian motion scaling limit has now been established @xcite .",
    "additionally , a number of extensions to more general random conductance models have also been proved @xcite .    whilst the above body of work provides some powerful techniques for overcoming the technical challenges involved in proving quenched invariance principles , such as studying ` the environment viewed from the particle ' or the ` harmonic corrector ' for the walk ( see @xcite for a survey of the recent developments in the area ) , these are not without their limitations .",
    "most notably , at some point , the arguments applied all depend in a fundamental way on the translation invariance or ergodicity under random walk transitions of the environment . as a consequence",
    ", some natural variations of the problem are not covered .",
    "consider , for example , supercritical percolation in a half - space @xmath2 , or possibly an orthant of @xmath1 .",
    "again , there is a unique infinite cluster ( figure [ intfig ] shows a simulation of such in the first quadrant of @xmath3 ) , upon which one can define a random walk .",
    "given the invariance principle for percolation on @xmath1 , one would reasonably expect that this process would converge , when rescaled diffusively , to a brownian motion reflected at the boundary .",
    "after all , as is illustrated in the figure , the ` holes ' in the percolation cluster that are in contact with the boundary are only on the same scale as those away from it .",
    "however , the presence of a boundary means that the translation invariance / ergodicity properties necessary for applying the existing arguments are lacking . for this reason",
    ", it has been one of the important open problems in this area to prove the quenched invariance principle for random walk on a percolation cluster , or amongst random conductances more generally , in a half - space ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section b ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 1.9 ) ) .",
    "our aim is to provide a new approach for overcoming this issue , and thereby establish invariance principles within some general framework that includes examples such as those just described .",
    "the approach of this paper is inspired by that of @xcite , where the invariance principle for random walk on grids inside a given euclidean domain @xmath4 is studied .",
    "it is shown first in @xcite for a class of bounded domains including lipschitz domains and then in @xcite for _ any _ bounded domain @xmath4 that the simple random walk converges to the ( normally ) reflecting brownian motion on @xmath4 when the mesh size of the grid tends to zero .",
    "heuristically , the normally reflecting brownian motion is a continuous markov process on @xmath5 that behaves like brownian motion in @xmath4 and is ` pushed back ' instantaneously along the inward normal direction when it hits the boundary .",
    "see section [ sect2 ] for a precise definition and more details .",
    "the main idea and approach of @xcite is as follows : ( i ) show that random walk killed upon hitting the boundary converges weakly to the absorbing brownian motion in @xmath4 , which is trivial ; ( ii ) establish tightness for the law of random walks ; ( iii ) show any sequential limit is a symmetric markov process and can be identified with reflecting brownian motion via a dirichlet form characterization . in @xcite ,",
    "( ii ) is achieved by using a forward - backward martingale decomposition of the process and the identification in ( iii ) is accomplished by using a result from the boundary theory of dirichlet form , which says that the reflecting brownian motion on @xmath4 is the maximal silverstein s extension of the absorbing brownian motion in @xmath4 ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) and ( * ? ? ? * theorem 6.6.9 ) .    for quenched invariance principles for random walks in random environments with a boundary , step ( i ) above can be established by applying a quenched invariance principle for the full - space case . for step ( ii ) , i.e.  establishing tightness , the forward - backward martingale decomposition method does not work well with unbounded random conductances . to overcome this difficulty , as well as for the desire to establish an invariance principle for every starting point",
    ", we will make the full use of detailed two - sided heat kernel estimates for random walk on random clusters .",
    "in particular , we provide sufficient conditions for the subsequential convergence that involve the hlder continuity of harmonic functions ( see section [ suffsec ] ) .",
    "this continuity property can be verified in examples by using existing two - sided heat kernel bounds .",
    "we remark that the corrector - type methods for full - space models , such as the approach of @xcite , often require only upper bounds on the heat kernel . using the hlder regularity",
    ", we can further show that any subsequential limit of random walks in random environments is a conservative symmetric hunt process with continuous sample paths . in step ( iii )",
    ", we can identify the subsequential limit process with the reflecting brownian motion by a dirichlet form argument ( see theorem [ thm : silvs ] ) . in summary ,",
    "our approach for proving quenched invariance principles for random walks in random environments with a boundary encompasses two novel aspects : a dirichlet form extension argument and the full use of detailed heat kernel estimates .    the full generality of the random conductance model to which we are able to apply the above argument is presented in section [ percsec ] . as an illustrative application of theorem [ thm : silvs ] ,",
    "though , we state here a theorem that verifies the conjecture described above concerning the diffusive behavior of the random walk on a supercritical percolation cluster on a half - space , quarter - space , etc .",
    "we recall that the variable speed random walk ( vsrw ) on a connected ( unweighted ) graph is the continuous time markov process that jumps from a vertex at a rate equal to its degree to a uniformly chosen neighbor ( see section [ percsec ] for further details ) . in this",
    "setting , similar results to that stated can be obtained for the so - called constant speed random walk ( csrw ) , which has mean one exponential holding times , or the discrete time random walk ( see remark [ genrem ] below ) .",
    "fix @xmath6 such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the unique infinite cluster of a supercritical bond percolation process on @xmath10 , and let @xmath11 be the associated vsrw . for almost - every realization of @xmath9 , it holds that the rescaled process @xmath12 , as defined by @xmath13 started from @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , converges in distribution to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a deterministic constant and @xmath18 is the ( normally ) reflecting brownian motion on @xmath19 started from @xmath20 .    as an alternative to unbounded domains",
    ", one could consider compact limiting sets , replacing @xmath21 in the previous theorem by the rescaled version of the variable speed random walk on the largest percolation cluster contained in a box @xmath22^d\\cap\\mathbb{z}^d$ ] , for example . as presented in section [ boxsec ] , another application of theorem [ thm : silvs ] allows an invariance principle to be established in this case as well , with the limiting process being brownian motion in the box @xmath23^d$ ] , reflected at the boundary .",
    "consequently , we are able to refine the existing knowledge of the mixing time asymptotics for the sequence of random graphs in question from a tightness result @xcite to an almost - sure convergence one ( see corollary [ mtcor ] below ) .",
    "note that the analytical part of our results ( namely section [ sect2 ] ) holds for a large class of possibly non - smooth domains , called uniform domains , which include ( global ) lipschitz domains and the classical van koch snowflake planar domain as special cases .",
    "although in the percolation setting we only consider relatively simple domains with ` flat ' boundaries , this is mainly for technical reasons so that deriving the percolation estimates in section [ percosect ] required for our proofs is manageable . indeed , in the case when we restrict to uniformly elliptic random conductances , so that controlling the clusters of extreme conductances is no longer an issue , we are able to derive from theorem [ thm : silvs ] quenched invariance principles in any uniform domain . these are discussed in section [ uesec ] .",
    "moreover , in section [ dfsec ] we explain how the same techniques can be applied in the uniformly elliptic random divergence form setting .",
    "( we refer to @xcite and the references therein for the history of homogenization for diffusions in random environments . )",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sect2 ]",
    ", we introduce an abstract framework for proving invariance principles for reversible markov processes in a euclidean domain .",
    "this is applied in section [ percsec ] to our main example of a random conductance model in half - spaces , quarter - spaces , etc .",
    "the details of the other examples discussed above are presented in section [ exsec ] .",
    "our results for the random conductance model depend on a number of technical percolation estimates , some of the proofs of which are contained in the appendix that appears at the end of this article .",
    "finally , the appendix also contains a proof of a generalization of existing quenched invariance principles that allows for arbitrary starting points ( previous results have always started the relevant processes from the origin , which will not be enough for our purposes ) .",
    "finally , in this paper , for a locally compact separable metric space @xmath24 , we use @xmath25 and @xmath26 to denote the space of bounded continuous functions on @xmath24 and the space of continuous functions on @xmath24 that vanish at infinity , respectively .",
    "the space of continuous functions on @xmath24 with compact support will be denoted by @xmath27 . for real numbers",
    "@xmath28 , we use @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the following definition is taken from visl @xcite , where various equivalent definitions are discussed .",
    "an open connected subset @xmath4 of @xmath33 is called _ uniform _ if there exists a constant @xmath34 such that for every @xmath35 there is a rectifiable curve @xmath36 joining @xmath20 and @xmath37 in @xmath4 with @xmath38 and moreover @xmath39 for all points @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 is the euclidean distance between the point @xmath42 and the set @xmath43 .",
    "note that a uniform domain is called _ inner uniform _ in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 3.6 ) .",
    "for example , the classical van koch snowflake domain in the conformal mapping theory is a uniform domain in @xmath44 .",
    "every ( global ) lipschitz domain is uniform , and every _ non - tangentially accessible domain _ defined by jerison and kenig in @xcite is a uniform domain ( see ( 3.4 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "however , the boundary of a uniform domain can be highly nonrectifiable and , in general , no regularity of its boundary can be inferred ( besides the easy fact that the hausdorff dimension of the boundary is strictly less than @xmath0 ) .",
    "it is known ( see example 4 on page 30 and proposition 1 in chapter viii of @xcite ) that any uniform domain in @xmath33 has @xmath45 and there exists a positive constant @xmath46 such that @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the lebesgue measure in @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a uniform domain in @xmath33 .",
    "suppose @xmath49 is a measurable symmetric @xmath50 matrix - valued function such that @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the @xmath0-dimensional identity matrix and @xmath53 is a constant in @xmath54 .",

    "it follows that @xmath61 is a regular dirichlet form on @xmath62 and so there is a continuous diffusion process @xmath63 associated with it , starting from @xmath64-quasi - every point . here a property is said to hold @xmath64-quasi - everywhere means that there is a set @xmath65 having zero capacity with respect to the dirichlet form @xmath61 so that the property holds for points in @xmath66 . according to (",
    "* theorem 3.10 ) and ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 3.6 ) ) ) @xmath67 admits a jointly continuous transition density function @xmath68 on @xmath69 and @xmath70 for every @xmath71 and @xmath72 . here",
    "the constants @xmath73 depend on the diffusion matrix @xmath74 only through the ellipticity bound @xmath53 in .",
    "consequently , @xmath67 can be refined so that it can start from every point in @xmath5 .",
    "the process @xmath67 is called a symmetric reflecting diffusion on @xmath5 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for sample path properties of @xmath67 . when @xmath75 , @xmath67 is the ( normally ) reflecting brownian motion on @xmath5 . reflecting brownian motion @xmath67 on @xmath5 in general",
    "does not need to be semimartingale .",
    "when @xmath43 locally has finite lower minkowski content , which is the case when @xmath4 is a lipschitz domain , @xmath67 is a semimartingale and admits the following skorohod decomposition ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.6 ) ) : @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the standard brownian motion in @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the unit inward normal vector field of @xmath4 on @xmath43 , and @xmath80 is a positive continuous additive functional of @xmath67 that increases only when @xmath67 is on the boundary , that is , @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "moreover , it is known that the reflecting brownian motion spends zero lebesgue amount of time at the boundary @xmath43 .",
