    "the young , massive progenitor stars of type ii supernovae are born in large molecular complexes .",
    "since half of the galactic supernova remnants ( snr ) are supposed to be of this type , it is expected that a similar number of snrs be in physical contact with their parent clouds .",
    "this contention is partially supported by co observations ( huang & thaddeus 1986 ) , which show a good positional correlation between large molecular complexes and snrs .",
    "thus , the interaction between snrs and molecular clouds seems to be a common phenomenon in nature .",
    "when a sn explodes near a molecular cloud , the expansion of the shock front into the cloud can accelerate relativistic particles , heat and compress the molecular gas , change its chemistry and produce turbulent mixing .",
    "condensed clumps created by this mechanism may eventually end as new stars .",
    "however , very few cases provide direct evidence of snr - molecular cloud interactions .",
    "morphological signatures are often invoked to prove a physical association between an snr and a molecular cloud ( eg . landecker et al .",
    "1989 , reynoso et al .",
    "1995 , dubner et al .",
    "1999 ) , but the most convincing evidence for shocked molecular gas are line broadenings ( frail & mitchell 1998 , reach & rho 1999 ) or spectral wings ( seta et al .",
    "1998 ) .    another powerful tool indicative of snr - molecular gas interaction is provided by the presence of oh 1720 mhz shock - excited masers . within several oh 1720 mhz surveys ( frail et al .",
    "1996 , green et al .",
    "1997 , koralesky et al .",
    "1998 ) , in which around 150 galactic snrs have been observed , oh 1720 mhz masers have been detected toward nearly twenty of them . in a recent paper , reynoso & mangum ( 2001",
    "; hereafter paper i ) have surveyed the environs of three of these snrs ( g349.7 + 0.2 , g16.7 + 0.1 and ctb 37a ) in the co j=10 transition , and found molecular clouds interacting with the shock fronts in all three cases . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the co data in a large field around one of these remnants : g349.7 + 0.2 .",
    "g349.7 + 0.2 is an incomplete clumpy shell , brighter to the south ( figure 1 ) , with a diameter of @xmath8 .",
    "based on hi observations ( caswell et al .",
    "1975 ) , this remnant is located beyond the tangent point , at a positive systemic velocity greater that + 6 , which places it also beyond the far side of the solar circle .",
    "clark & caswell ( 1976 ) suggest that the strong north - south emission ridge observed in radio continuum is not a filled center but represents a non - uniform distribution of emission in a shell , which would be evidence for a strong interaction with the interstellar medium ( ism ) at an early stage . in paper",
    "i , it was shown that the oh 1720 mhz masers detected by frail et al .",
    "( 1996 ) toward this remnant , appear encircling a molecular cloud of @xmath9 pc in diameter , located at the same systemic velocity of the masers .",
    "the extension of the area covered by our survey allowed the detection of a much larger , ring - like co feature , that includes the small molecular cloud interacting with g349.7 + 0.2 .    in this paper ,",
    "we investigate the origin of this large structure and its connection with g349.7 + 0.2 . in section 2 , we describe the observations .",

    ", we summarize our conclusions .",
    "observations of the co j=10 line ( 115.271204 ghz ) were performed with the nrao 12 meter telescope located on kitt peak , arizona , on 1998 june 12 - 18 and 27 - 30 .",
    "the beam size at this frequency is @xmath1 .",
    "the observational parameters are listed in table [ tbl1 ] , including the noise of the final images .",

    "an absolute position - switching mode was used .",
    "the reference position was measured to be free of co emission down to levels of less than about 0.5 k. four maps , covering a square field of @xmath10 , were obtained .    since data at the 12 meter telescope are calibrated by default to the t@xmath11 scale , which is equivalent to the radiation temperature t@xmath12 for a source much larger than the main diffraction beam of the telescope , it is often necessary to apply corrections which refer to sources of different sizes . for sources with sizes in the range @xmath13 , the efficiency factor which converts t@xmath11 to t@xmath12",
    "is 0.85 based on historic measurements of the planets jupiter and saturn .",
    "the aips package was employed for data processing .",
    "baselines were subtracted directly from the raw data with the task sdlsf .",
    "this task computes a first degree polynomial using a unique range of line - free channels in the whole area . because of the proximity of g349.7 + 0.2 to the galactic plane , it was extremely difficult to find a suitable range of line - free channels .",
    "we thus decided to give priority to the baseline removal in the regions closest to the remnants and oh 1720 mhz masers , with possible detriment to the rest .",
    "maps were averaged for each source using the task wtsum , with @xmath14 as weight , where @xmath15 is the noise image . due to the very high noise of one of the original maps ,",

    ", we will refer to the large co structure as the `` large co shell '' , and will identify individual smaller clouds within this structure with numbers .",
    "one of the individual clouds , hereafter `` cloud 1 '' , has been reported in paper i. cloud 1 has a systemic velocity of + 16.5 , and is positionally coincident with g349.7 + 0.2 .",
    "based on the presence of oh 1720 mhz shock - excited masers at the same position and velocity , as well as infrared emission from shock - heated dust arising from the same location , it was concluded that the snr is interacting with this molecular cloud .    as in paper",

    "the mass of a cloud can be expressed as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the distance in kpc , and @xmath29 is the angular radius of the cloud in arcmin , computed as half the measured diameter deconvolved by the beam size .",
    "assuming spherical volumes , the density can be estimated as : @xmath30    based on the close agreement between the systemic velocities of cloud 1 and the large co shell , the distance adopted for the whole molecular complex will be the kinematical distance to cloud 1 , @xmath31 kpc , which corresponds to a galactocentric distance of @xmath32 kpc ( paper i ) .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath33 is assumed to be @xmath34 2 ( k ) @xmath35 ( digel , bally & thaddeus 1990 ) . the derived parameters may be over estimated by a factor of 2 ( see paper i ) .",
    "the mass and h@xmath2 density of the large co shell can be roughly estimated to be about 9.3@xmath3 m@xmath4 and 35 3 , respectively . in this computation , an outer diameter of @xmath36 870 arcsec and an inner diameter of @xmath36",
    "500 arcsec were assumed . at",
    "the distance assumed , the outer diameter of the large co shell is @xmath37 100 pc .",
    "although the density is somewhat low , both mass and size place this structure in the category of giant molecular clouds ( goldsmith 1987 ) .    with the aim of exploring",
    "if star formation is taking place in the large co shell , we have searched for protostellar candidates in the iras point source catalogue that fulfill the following selection criteria : ( 1 ) @xmath38 jy , ( 2 ) @xmath39 , and ( 3 ) @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the ( uncorrected ) ir - flux density in the wavelength @xmath42 m .",
    "the first criterion selects only strong sources , while the second and third discriminate against cool stars , planetary nebula and cirrus clumps ( junkes , frst & reich 1992 ) .",

    "there is compelling evidence that g349.7 + 0.2 is interacting with a molecular cloud . moreover",
    ", our present results suggest that the sn event occurred inside the large co shell , thus confirming the statement of clark & caswell ( 1976 ) that the expansion has been influenced by a dense environment .",
    "nevertheless , it is unlikely that cloud 1 has interacted with the shock front in early stages , since stars are more probable to explode in the interclump gas than in dense clumps ( chevalier 1999 ) .",
    "the radio structure of g349.7 + 0.2 can be fitted by two overlapping rings , with one smaller and brighter than the other .",
    "this characteristic similar to many other snrs , can be easily explained if the smaller ring corresponds to the side of the expanding shell encountering the higher density ( manchester 1987 ) .",
    "we therefore propose a scenario in which the sn shock front has expanded into a density gradient ; the smaller half of the shell has expanded into higher density gas and is now running through cloud 1 .    assuming a distance of 23 kpc to g349.7 + 0.2 , the radii of the large and small rings are @xmath49 pc and @xmath50 pc respectively .",
    "based on fig .",
    "3 , the small ring appears to be expanding into the large co shell , while the large ring is expanding into a region of low density .",
    "if the energy was conserved during expansion , then @xmath51 ( e.g. dubner et al . 1992 ) , and we can expect that the distances @xmath52 and @xmath53 travelled by the shock front during the lifetime of the remnant be related by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 refers to the ambient medium into which each of the two rings is expanding . replacing @xmath56 by 35 3  ( table [ tbl2 ] ) , we deduce that @xmath57 3 .    in an inhomogeneus medium",
    ", an snr can be undergoing different evolutive stages in different places at the same time . here , the expansion of the larger ring is analyzed .",
    "cioffi , mckee & bertschinger ( 1988 ) determined the radius of an snr at the onset of the radiative phase as : @xmath58 where @xmath59 for solar abundances . adopting a canonical value of @xmath60 ergs , and assuming an ambient density of 15 3 , equation ( 3 ) yields @xmath61 pc . in spite of the uncertainties involved in this determination ,",
    "it can be considered then that the radiative phase has not been achieved yet , and therefore the use of the sedov equations is appropriate .",
    "the equations that govern the expansion of an snr in the sedov phase are extracted from cox ( 1972 ) : @xmath62 @xmath63 from equation ( 4 ) , the age of the remnant is 1.4@xmath48 yrs , and thus the shock velocity is @xmath64 .",
    "using once again the relationship @xmath65 , we find that the velocity of the shock front driven into the higher density gas of the large co shell is @xmath66  which , when entering cloud 1 , can be slowed down to 33 . at velocities lower than @xmath67 ,",
    "shocks are of c - type ( neufeld & dalgarno 1989 ) , thus this estimate is consistent with the theoretical prediction by lockett , gauthier & elitzur ( 1999 ) that the conditions under which 1720 mhz oh maser emission is produced can exist only if shocks are of c - type .",
    "based on the morphology , we suggest that the large co shell is the remains of an expansive event . in what follows",
    ", we try to explain the origin of this structure .",
    "the hypothesis of a wind - driven bubble can be discarded since a literature search revealed no early - type stars or associations within the area subtended by the large co shell .",
    "therefore , as an alternative , we will investigate the hypothesis that the expansive event was a sn explosion .",
    "assuming that the mass of the large co shell was initially distributed uniformly in a sphere of radius @xmath68 ( @xmath67 pc ) , then the original density was @xmath69 3 .",
    "since the large co shell extends over a velocity interval of about 6 , we adopt a velocity expansion of 3  as a working hypothesis . taking into account that in the radiative phase , which is the last stage in the evolution of an snr before dissipating in the ism , the expansion law is @xmath70 , an upper limit to the age of the shell",
    "can be obtained as @xmath71 yrs .",
    "this age is sufficient for the formation of protostars . in the next paragraphs",
    ", the origin of the two iras sources found in coincidence with co peaks will be discussed .    because of its spectral characteristics , iras 17147 - 3725 is catalogued as an ultra - compact ( uc ) h ii region ( wood & churchwell 1989 ) . in fig .",
    "3 , it can be seen that iras 17147 - 3725 is positionally coincident with a weak , unresolved radio continuum point source .",
    "this continuum source has a peak flux more than 20 times above @xmath15 , and has an integrated flux of @xmath72 jy at 1.41 ghz .",
    "we propose that this source is the radio continuum counterpart of the uc - h ii region iras 17147 - 3725 .",
    "compact h ii regions are created when ultraviolet emission from newly formed stars ionize the neighboring gas .",
    "also , the surrounding dust is heated and reradiates the energy at infrared wavelengths .",
    "therefore , the iras source 17147 - 3725 is very likely dust heated by a recently formed star .",
    "to trace the high density cores where high mass stars are born , bronfman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) observed uc - h ii regions in the cs j=2 - 1 line , and found that iras 17147 - 3725 has a peak at + 17.6 , which is in coincidence with the systemic velocities of cloud 2 and the large co shell ( table [ tbl2 ] ) .",
    "the lyman continuum ( lyc ) flux from the ionizing star in the uc - h ii region can be derived from the radio continuum flux as : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is given in ghz , @xmath75 in jy and @xmath28 is the distance in kpc ( mezger , smith & churchwell 1974 ) .",
    "a temperature of @xmath76 k and a ratio @xmath77he / h=0.1 have been assumed .",
    "the flux obtained , @xmath78 photons s@xmath35 , is consistent with an o9 - o9.5 zams type star ( panagia 1973 ) . on the other hand , following helou , soifer & rowan - robinson ( 1985 ) , the luminosity of the iras point source can be estimated from the fluxes at 60 @xmath79 m and 100 @xmath79 m according to : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the integrated flux from the band between 42 @xmath79 m and 122 @xmath79 m .",
    "we can compute , then , the parameter @xmath82 that characterizes a compact h ii region ( panagia 1974 ) , where @xmath83 is the energy of a single lyman-@xmath84 photon and @xmath84 is the ratio of the total luminosity of the star to the expected lyman-@xmath84 luminosity . for a o9.5 type star , @xmath85 ( panagia 1973 ) , thus @xmath86 .",
    "high values of @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) indicate that the dust is still mixed with the ionized gas to an appreciable extent .",
    "the value obtained here implies therefore that this uc - h ii region is a very young object .",
    "let us now discuss the origin of iras 17146 - 3723 , the source coincident with cloud 1 .",
    "condensed molecular matter can form a protostar after the matter has cooled , which occurs in a period of the order of @xmath89 years .",
    "such a period is too long compared to the age of g349.7 + 0.2 deduced in section 4.1 , thus this iras source can not be a protostar triggered by g349.7 + 0.2 .",
    "we suggest , therefore , that the ir emission from this source arises from dust heated by the shock front of g349.7 + 0.2 .",
    "the oh 1720 mhz masers detected by frail et al .",
    "( 1996 ) towards this remnant provides additional support to the presence of shocked interstellar gas .",
    "the large co shell shares some common characteristics with another snr , g54.4 - 0.3 , which is claimed to be a case of sn induced star formation : both present a co shell slowly expanding at @xmath90 , in an ambient medium with density @xmath91 3 , and both have an iras source coincident with a compact h ii region created by an o9 type star ( junkes et al .",
    "the main difference is that the co shell of g54.4 - 0.3 coincides with a radio continuum shell , while available radio surveys show no continuum emission at the position of the large co shell . according to the @xmath92-@xmath28 relation of case & bhattacharya ( 1998 ) ,",
    "the surface brightness that should be observed is @xmath93 w m@xmath94 hz@xmath35 sr@xmath35 .",
    "such a low surface brightness is probably missed by galactic radio surveys ( see green 1991 ) .",
    "nevertheless , both the age derived above and the low expansion velocity , suggest that the shock has disappeared and the large co shell is an snr in the phase of dissipation .",
    "besides , due to the old age of this remnant , there is no need for an alternative explanation for the origin of the star that created the uc - h ii region iras 17147 - 3725 . in the case of g54.4 - 0.3 , instead , junkes et al .",
    "( 1992 ) need to include a stellar wind previous to the sn explosion to explain how the protostar detected as an iras point source was triggered , since the snr was not old enough .    in summary ,",
    "the scenario proposed here is that a sn exploded some @xmath95 years ago at approximately ra=@xmath96 , decl=@xmath97 ( j2000 ) , in a molecular cloud with density @xmath69 3 .",
    "the sn shock wave triggered the formation of an o9 - o9.5 type star , currently detected as the ir source iras 17147 - 3725 .",
    "it is possible that the progenitor star of g349.7 + 0.2 has also been triggered by the expansion of the large co shell .",
    "the large co shell , therefore , constitutes a new candidate for sn induced star formation .",
    "even though the evidence is not conclusive , it is important to note that the case most strongly claimed to be sn induced star formation , is based on the spatial coincidence between the association cma r1 and an optical ring which , together with an hi expanding shell , is interpreted as an old snr ( herbst & assousa 1977 ) . however , the hypothetical snr could never be confirmed .",
    "the surroundings of the snr g349.7 + 0.2 have been investigated in the co j=1 - 0 transition .",
    "our observations allowed us to determine the density distribution of the ism into which this remnant is expanding . a large ,",

    "it was found that `` cloud 1 '' , the co cloud interacting with g349.7 + 0.2 ( paper i ) , is part of the large co shell .",
    "we suggest that this molecular shell is the remnant of an old supernova explosion , now in the phase of dissipation .",
    "we analyzed the interaction between g349.7 + 0.2 and the large co shell , and concluded that the age of the former is about 1.4@xmath48 years .",
    "the shock driven by g349.7 + 0.2 into cloud 1 was confirmed to be of c - type , in agreement with the conditions requiered for oh 1720 mhz masers to exist ( lockett et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "three iras point like sources with spectral characteristics typical of protostars were found in the large co shell .",
    "one of them , iras 17146 - 3727 , is a clump of dust heated by the shock front ( paper i ) .",
    "another one , iras 17147 - 3725 , is located at the position of a co peak , and coincides with an uc - h ii region , probably produced by an o9 - 9.5 type star .    in summary , we propose that the explosion of a star , about @xmath98 years ago , in a medium with density 30 3 , pushed the surrounding gas forming what we see now as the large co shell and triggered , during its expansion , the birth of an o9 - o9.5 type star detected as the ir source iras 17147 - 3725 .",
    "it is possible that the formation of the progenitor star of g349.7 + 0.2 was also induced in the same way .",
    "high sensitivity radio - continuum observations are needed to investigate whether the large co shell has a counterpart in synchrotron emission and to measure the strength and orientation of magnetic fields in this direction .",

    "<S> a field of @xmath0 around the supernova remnant ( snr ) g349.7 + 0.2 has been surveyed in the co j=10 transition with the 12 meter telescope of the nrao , using the on - the - fly technique . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution of the observations is @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that this remnant is interacting with a small co cloud which , in turn , is part of a much larger molecular complex , which we call the `` large co shell '' . </S>",
    "<S> the large co shell has a diameter of about 100 pc , an h@xmath2 mass of 9.3@xmath3 m@xmath4 and a density of 35 3 . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the origin of this structure and suggest that an old supernova explosion ocurred about @xmath5 years ago , as a suitable hypothesis . analyzing the interaction between g349.7 + 0.2 and the large co shell , it is possible to determine that the shock front currently driven into the molecular gas is a non - dissociative shock ( c - type ) , in agreement with the presence of oh 1720 mhz masers . the positional and kinematical coincidence among one of the co clouds that constitute the large co shell , an iras point - like source and an ultracompact h ii region , </S>",
    "<S> indicate the presence of a recently formed star . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the formation of this star was triggered during the expansion of the large co shell , and suggest the possibility that the same expansion also created the progenitor star of g349.7 + 0.2 </S>",
    "<S> . the large co shell would then be one of the few observational examples of supernova - induced star formation .    </S>",
