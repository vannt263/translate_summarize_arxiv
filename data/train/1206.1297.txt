    "acoustic streaming represents a classical topic of fluid dynamics , see _ e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "it usually describes the averaged flow generated by a given acoustic wave .",
    "the related asymptotic analysis is usually based on the navier - stokes equations and goes up to the second - order ( in amplitude ) terms , while the terms of the third and higher orders appear as physically irrelevant . in contrary to this classical approach we build a rigorous asymptotic procedure based on the euler equations where the first - order averaged equations ( we call it an acoustic - drift equation ( ade ) ) appears from the treatment of the third - order approximation ( when the primary acoustic wave is treated as the zero order ) .",
    "mathematically , we suggest that velocity , density , and pressure oscillate with frequency higher than inverse characteristic times of all other co - existing motions .",
    "it can be expressed as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is dimensionless frequency of oscillations . to derive the averaged equation",
    "we employ the two - timing method in the form used by @xcite .",
    "the resulted averaged vorticity equation is similar to the original equation , but surprisingly a drift velocity ( instead of reynolds stresses ) plays a part of an additional advection velocity .",
    "the derived equation for the averaged first - order vorticity ( ade ) formally coincides with the craik - leibovich equations for an incompressible fluid ( @xcite ) , while the difference in our case appears as the prescribed divergence of velocity .",
    "an additional incentive for our research is to make all the calculations and derivations elementary and free of any physical and mathematical assumptions ( except the most common ones , such as the existence of differentiable solutions ) .",
    "we use only eulerian description and eulerian averaging operation , since they are the most transparent and allow us to avoid any unnecessary difficulties .",
    "the governing equation for an inviscid compressible barotropic fluid ( gas ) with velocity field @xmath2 , density @xmath3 , vorticity @xmath4 and pressure @xmath5 is taken in the vorticity form @xmath6^*+{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}^ * { \\mathrm{div}\\,}{\\boldsymbol{u}}^*=0,\\quad \\text{in}\\quad \\mathcal{d}^*\\\\ & & { \\partial\\rho^*}/{\\partial { t}^*}+({\\boldsymbol{u}}^*\\cdot\\nabla)\\rho^*+\\rho^*{\\mathrm{div}\\,}{\\boldsymbol{u}}^*=0=0\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where asterisks mark dimensional variables and operations , @xmath7-time , @xmath8-cartesian coordinates , and @xmath9^*$ ] stands for the dimensional commutator ( [ commutr ] ) .",
    "the term with pressure has been excluded since the fluid is barotropic @xmath10 . in this paper",

    "then eqn.([exact-6-h ] ) contains two independent small parameters : @xmath67 here we must make an auxiliary ( but technically essential ) assumption : after the use of the chain rule ( [ exact-6-h ] ) variables @xmath24 and @xmath25 are considered to be _ mutually independent _ : @xmath68 following the same distinguished limit argument as in ( @xcite ) we take @xmath69 in this paper we will show that the first three successive approximations ( with @xmath24 ( [ tau - s - h ] ) ) do produce a valid asymptotic solution .",
    "the proof of other properties of the distinguished limit are similar to the one considered in @xcite ; this proof is beyond the style and scope of this paper and is omitted .",

    "let us look for the solutions of ( [ exact-6eps])-([exact-6eps - lambda ] ) in the form of regular series @xmath72 we study the class of flows which represents acoustic waves ( and the related streaming flows ) at the state of rest : @xmath73 which implies that @xmath74 the considered asymptotic series for velocity and density are @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 satisfies the classical linear acoustic equations that easily follow after the substitution of ( [ vel - dens - ass ] ) into the euler s equations , which are related to ( [ exact-6eps]),([exact-6eps - h ] ) but not presented here for brevity .",
    "an important fact for euler s equations is : the application of @xmath78 to ( [ exact-6eps ] ) should produce a gradient of a function ( enthalpy ) which must be @xmath79 if we wish to build a valid asymptotic procedure ; this order of enthalpy requires an appropriate scale ( in terms of @xmath80 ) for pressure .",
    "in fact , all the derivation of ade can be carried ahead in terms of velocity field for the euler equations , however in this paper we exploit the simplification of calculations for the vorticity equation .",
    "it means that the fields @xmath81 everywhere below are considered as a given solution of the classical inviscid linear acoustic equations .",
    "the substitution of ( [ basic-4aa-0-h])-([sol-00 ] ) into ( [ exact-6eps])-([exact-6eps - lambda ] ) produces the equations of successive approximations .",
    "let us first consider the equation for @xmath82 ( [ exact-6eps - lambda ] ) :    the zero - order equation is @xmath83 .",
    "its unique solution ( [ f - tilde=0 ] ) is @xmath84 and @xmath85 . taking into account ( [ mean01 ] ) we can write @xmath86 which means that the zero - order flow is potential and purely oscillating . eqn ( [ sol-0 ] ) leads to the similar first - order approximation of @xmath87 which have the unique solution @xmath88 where a mean function remains undetermined .",
    "the second - order equations that take into account ( [ mean01]),([sol-0]),([sol-1 ] ) are @xmath89=0 $ ] which after tilde - integration ( [ oper-7 ] ) yield @xmath90,\\quad \\overline{{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}}_2=\\boxed{?}\\label{sol-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the third - order equation that takes into account ( [ mean01]),([sol-0]),([sol-1 ] ) is @xmath91 + [ \\overline{{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}}_1,\\widehat{{\\boldsymbol{u}}}_1]=0\\nonumber \\label{eqn-3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the bar - part ( [ oper-1 ] ) ( or the averaged part ) of this equation is @xmath92 + \\langle[\\widetilde{{\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}}}_2,\\widetilde{{\\boldsymbol{u}}}_0]\\rangle=0\\label{eqn-3-bar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be transformed with the use of ( [ sol-2 ] ) and ( [ lem1 ] ) into the form @xmath93=0 \\label{eqn-3-bar1 - 1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the drift velocity is @xmath94\\rangle/2\\label{drift - vel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is given by ( [ sol-00 ] ) . taking into account that @xmath95 ( [ drift - vel ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath96=0 \\label{eqn-3-bar1 - 1a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the same as @xmath97 the next step of our consideration is to repeat a similar ( but analytically simpler ) asymptotic procedure for the density equation ( [ exact-6eps - h ] ) . omitting the calculations we state that it yields @xmath98 and the equation ( [ eqn-3-bar1 - 1aa ] )",
    "is reduced to @xmath99 taking @xmath78 of this equation yields @xmath100 where @xmath101 is modified pressure .",
    "the component version of this equation ( where we drop the subscripts ` 1 ' of the first approximation and ` 0 ' for a drift , use the summation convention , and introduce different modified pressure @xmath102 ) is : @xmath103 new equations for a streaming flow ( [ eqn-3-bar1 - 1aaa])-([eqn-3-bar1-vel - comp ] ) ( which we call ade ) represent the main result of this paper .",
    "one can see that ade ( [ eqn-3-bar1-vel - comp ] ) represents an euler s equation ` modified ' by additional ` advection term ' and ` linear friction term ' @xmath104 this ` effective friction ' is linear in velocity @xmath105 and can be positive or negative .",
    "this term is important for the zero - order solutions ( [ sol-00 ] ) with the amplitude of acoustic wave changing in space , similar to described in @xcite . indeed , with the decreasing of the amplitude @xmath106 of an acoustic wave ( [ sol-00 ] ) with the distance ( say , with the increasing the distance from the source of sound ) , the value @xmath107 ( [ drift - vel ] ) is also decreasing . therefore the ` friction term ' become positive ( which corresponds to ` anti - friction ' or ` negative friction ' ) ; from the physical viewpoint it should generate the acoustic streaming .",
    "this argument formally repeats the treatment of @xcite . however returning to the averaged vorticity equation ( [ eqn-3-bar1 - 1aaaa ] )",
    ", one can see that if the average vorticity is zero at the initial data , then it will always be equal to zero .",
    "it means that the presence of a variable in space amplitude is not sufficient for the generation of acoustic streaming .",
    "this conclusion confirms the classical idea about essentially viscous nature of acoustic streaming . at the same time ade contradicts to the estimations of acoustic streaming obtained without taking viscosity into consideration , see @xcite p.214 , where a prescribed attenuated plane wave is introduced ` by hands ' into an inviscid setting for forces .",
    "the above explanation indicates that ade does not describe the acoustic streaming when the streaming velocity is small .",
    "however ade can be relevant to ` intense ' regimes of acoustic streaming , including the generation of secondary vortices , similar to langmuir circulations @xcite .",
    "\\3 . our approach ( based on the two - timing method , distinguished limit , and the unusual choice of small parameter ) is different from the mainstream classical theory of acoustic streaming .",
    "it suggests that ade can give new results .",
    "the presented asymptotic procedure ( based on the equation for vorticity ) is remarkably simple .",
    "however it has one disadvantage : modified pressure in ade ( [ eqn-3-bar1-vel ] ) and ( [ eqn-3-bar1-vel - comp ] ) remains undefined ( in terms of physical parameters involved ) .",
    "therefore the important next step is to repeat the same asymptotic procedure for the euler equations , from the very beginning .",
    "the expressions for modified pressure will allow one to calculate the forces exerted on walls , particles , _ etc .",
    "the notion of a drift is actively used in this paper .",
    "it is known that a drift velocity can appear from lagrangian , eulerian , or hybrid ( euler - lagrange ) considerations ; look for the discussion related to these options in @xcite .",
    "the relation between high - frequency asymptotic solutions and small - amplitude asymptotic solutions were studied in @xcite ; in particular , for purely periodic non - modulated solutions these classes can be isomorphic to each other ( any solution from one class can be transformed into a solution from another class ) .",
    "viscosity and diffusivity can be incorporated into our asymptotic theory .",
    "however , viscous and diffusion terms produce additional to ( [ small - pars - h ] ) independent small parameters and the result will essentially depend on their order in terms of @xmath80 .",
    "in particular , the scale of slow time @xmath24 ( [ tau - s - h ] ) can be different ."
