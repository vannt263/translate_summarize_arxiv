    "the idea that our world may be a brane embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime has been attracting a great deal of physical interest .",
    "this idea is often called the brane world scenario and , as suggested by randall and sundrum  @xcite , may be able to explain the large hierarchy between the planck scale and the electroweak scale in a natural way .",
    "many aspects of the brane world scenario have been investigated : for example , the effective four - dimensional einstein s equation on a positive tension brane  @xcite , weak gravity  @xcite , black holes  @xcite , inflating branes  @xcite , cosmologies  @xcite , and so on .    in the original randall - sundrum brane world scenario , these authors considered five - dimensional pure gravity described by the einstein - hilbert action with a negative cosmological constant and two @xmath3-branes with tension . because of the negative cosmological constant the five - dimensional bulk geometry is highly curved and the curvature scale is possibly of the order of the five - dimensional planck scale , while the induced geometries on the branes are flat , provided that brane tensions are fine - tuned",
    "therefore , it is expected that quantum effects in the bulk may be important in the brane world scenario , since quantum effects in curved spacetime usually become important when the spacetime geometry is highly curved or when the causal structure is non - trivial  @xcite . in this connection ,",
    "several authors investigated quantum effects in the brane world scenario  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite exact semiclassical solutions representing a static brane world with two branes were obtained by analyzing the semiclassical einstein s equation in five - dimensions with a negative cosmological constant and conformally invariant bulk matter fields . there , the following two types of solutions were found .",
    "type-(a ) : solution with a positive tension brane and a negative tension brane .",
    "type-(b ) : solution with two positive tension branes . for each type of semiclassical solution ,",
    "two relations between the warp factor and brane tensions were found : one giving the warp factor as a function of the brane tensions and another giving a relation between the brane tensions .    although it is interesting that we could obtain analytic solutions in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , it seems that this model is not realistic enough .",
    "as far as the author knows , there is no realization of conformally invariant bulk matter fields starting from m - theory or superstring theory .",
    "nonetheless , it is expected that the solutions in ref .",
    "@xcite may actually capture some important features of quantum effects in the brane world scenario .",
    "hence , it is worth while to extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite to more realistic brane world models which also take bulk quantum effects into account .",
    "for this purpose , one would like to consider higher curvature corrections to the tree - level bulk action . as discussed in the next section ,",
    "@xmath4 corrections are realistic from the point view of m - theory .    in this paper",
    "a simple five - dimensional brane world model is proposed , motivated by m - theory compactified on a six - dimensional manifold of small radius and an @xmath0 of large radius .",
    "we include the leading - order higher curvature correction to the tree - level bulk action . as a tractable model of the bulk theory we consider pure gravity including a @xmath1ricci - scalar@xmath2-correction to the einstein - hilbert action . in this model theory , after a conformal transformation to the einstein frame , we numerically obtain static solutions , each of which consists of a positive tension brane and a negative tension brane . for these solutions , we obtain two relations between the warp factor and brane tensions .",
    "those solutions and relations are a close analogue of the type-(a ) solutions and relations obtained in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , in the present model it will be shown that there is no analogue of the type-(b ) solutions .",
    "this fact might be considered to be consistent with the suggestion of refs .",

    "in this section we propose a simple brane world model , motivated by m - theory compactified on a six - dimensional compact manifold ( eg .",
    "calabi - yau manifold ) of small radius and an @xmath0 of large radius  @xcite .",
    "in this situation , effectively we may consider a five - dimensional theory compactified on the @xmath0 .",
    "in the five - dimensional bulk action , we shall consider a correction by a @xmath4 term to the einstein - hilbert term   since several calculations of higher - order corrections to the effective action suggest that in eleven - dimensions @xmath5 terms do not appear but @xmath4 terms may appear  @xcite   terms in m - theory was originally pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite and many authors showed evidences of it  @xcite .",
    "possible cosmological consequences were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "it is expected that the @xmath4 corrections play important roles in brane world scenarios since the curvature scale in the bulk may be comparable to the five - dimensional planck scale and , thus , higher curvature corrections can not be neglected .    on the other hand , as for the action on branes , higher curvature corrections are expected to be less important than those in the bulk and can be neglected since curvature scale induced on branes ( at least on our brane ) should be small compared to the planck scale in low energy .",
    "nonetheless , motivated by the four- and ten - dimensional effective theory induced on the fixed points of @xmath0  @xcite , we may include @xmath5 corrections to brane actions . in the following",

    "we shall solve the differential equation ( [ eqn : diff - eq ] ) with the boundary condition ( [ eqn : y10=0 ] ) and ( [ eqn : y3=root ] ) by the so called relaxation method  @xcite .",

    "@xmath104 in other words , except for vicinities of the boundaries , the scalar field @xmath48 stays near the minimum of the potential @xmath38 and the five - dimensional geometry is almost the ads whose curvature is determined by the minimal value of @xmath38 .",
    "however , because of the boundary condition ( [ eqn : y3=root ] ) , near - boundary behaviors of solutions are non - trivial .",
    "actually , figures  [ fig : left - y2 - 10 ] and [ fig : right - y2 - 10 ] show that the five dimensional geometry near the boundaries deviates rather strongly from ads .",
    "the deviation is larger for a smaller value of @xmath95 , or a larger value of the coefficient @xmath9 of the @xmath4-term , as easily expected .",

    "each of figures  [ fig : left - y3 - 10 ] and [ fig : right - y3 - 10 ] shows how the scalar field approaches one of roots of the potential .",
    "we now argue that there are no ( static ) solutions of ( @xmath106)- and ( @xmath107)-types .",
    "first , let us rewrite the differential equation as @xmath108 where @xmath109 and the corresponding boundary condition is @xmath110 it is easy to show from ( [ eqn : diff - eq - rk ] ) and ( [ eqn : bc - rk ] ) that @xmath111 next , it is also easy to show by using the last equation of ( [ eqn : diff - eq - rk ] ) that , if @xmath112 and @xmath113 for @xmath114 , then @xmath115 for @xmath116 , where @xmath102 is the global minimum of @xmath85 between @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "thus , if @xmath101 starts from @xmath118 at @xmath119 and reaches the region @xmath120 then @xmath101 can not return to @xmath118 at @xmath121 .",
    "thirdly , combining this fact with ( [ eqn : dev=0 ] ) , we can show that there is no solution of the ( @xmath106)-type which is bounded in the region @xmath122 . actually , ( [ eqn : dev=0 ] ) implies that if @xmath101 starts from @xmath118 at @xmath119 and is bounded in the region @xmath122 then @xmath101 should reach the region @xmath120 , from which @xmath101 can not return to @xmath118 at @xmath121 .",
    "similarly , we can show that there is no solution of the ( @xmath107)-type which is bounded in the region @xmath123 .",
    "heuristically , the above mathematical statement can be easily inferred if one interprets the last two equations of ( [ eqn : diff - eq - rk ] ) as the equation of motion for a particle position @xmath124 at time @xmath68 . in this interpretation ,",
    "the particle receives the force due to the reversed potential @xmath125 and the friction ( or anti - friction ) force @xmath126 .",
    "moreover , with this heuristic interpretation in mind , it seems likely that any solution should be bounded in the region @xmath122 since the reversed potential @xmath125 is negative outside the region @xmath127 and @xmath128 . finally ,",
    "combining this with the above mathematical statement , we can say at least for moderate @xmath95 that there are no solutions of ( @xmath106)- and ( @xmath107)-types .    moreover , ( @xmath129)- and ( @xmath130)-types are equivalent to each other up to the coordinate transformation @xmath131 . hence , ( @xmath130)-type solutions are all we have been seeking .    figures  [ fig : tension1 ] and [ fig : tension2 ] show relations between the warp factor @xmath89 given by ( [ eqn : warp - factor ] ) and the brane tension @xmath12 or @xmath13 given by ( [ eqn : brane - tension ] ) for ( @xmath130)-type solutions",
    ". we can see that the tension of each brane converges quickly to an @xmath95-dependent value when the warp factor becomes large . to be precise ,",
    "@xmath132 as @xmath133",
    ". the convergence can be easily understood as follows by the heuristic interpretation .",
    "we consider a particle in one dimension whose position at time @xmath68 is @xmath124 and which receives a force due to the reversed potential @xmath125 and the friction ( or anti - friction ) force .",
    "the particle moves from @xmath134 to @xmath135 in the fixed duration @xmath70 . for a large @xmath96 , in order to satisfy this boundary condition , the particle should stay near @xmath136 for a relatively long time since the reversed potential is steep . in this case , the initial ( or final ) velocity @xmath137 ( or @xmath138 , respectively ) should be fine - tuned to a value close to the escape velocity , which is roughly proportional to @xmath96 , against the reversed potential . because of the relation @xmath139 ( or @xmath140 , respectively ) and the junction condition ( [ eqn : brane - tension ] ) , the fine - tuning of @xmath137 ( or @xmath138 , respectively ) is equivalent to the fine - tuning of @xmath12 ( or @xmath13 , respectively ) .",
    "the required value of @xmath12 ( or @xmath13 , respectively ) is almost independent of @xmath96 since the required value of @xmath137 ( or @xmath138 , respectively ) is roughly proportional to @xmath96 as stated above . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath101 stays near @xmath102 with a very small velocity , @xmath141 should satisfy @xmath142 since the right hand side of the last equation of ( [ eqn : diff - eq ] ) should vanish approximately .",
    "hence , @xmath103 grows approximately linearly in @xmath68 with the growth rate proportional to @xmath96 when @xmath101 stays near @xmath102 .",
    "thus , the exponent of the warp factor should be roughly proportional to @xmath96 .",
    "actually , except for vicinities of the boundaries , the numerical solutions are well approximated by ( [ eqn : approx - y1-y3 ] ) and thus the warp factor is well approximated by @xmath143.\\ ] ] finally , combining the approximate linearity of the exponent of the warp factor with the fine - tuning of the brane tension , we can conclude that the brane tension should converge to a constant as the warp factor becomes large .",
    "the limiting value of the brane tension should depend on the parameter @xmath95 since the escape velocity depends on @xmath95 .",
    "this conclusion is of course consistent with the numerical result .",
    "figure  [ fig : tension3 ] shows a relation between tension of our brane at @xmath119 and that of the hidden brane at @xmath121 .",
    "this relation can be considered as a necessary condition for the system with two branes to be static , or the condition for the four - dimensional cosmological constant to vanish .",
    "now let us give an argument that there is no static solution for @xmath78 .",
    "the following argument is almost the same as that for the non - existence of @xmath144- and @xmath145-type solutions .",
    "first , let us consider the case @xmath146 .",
    "in this case the potential @xmath85 has only one root @xmath147 , and thus only @xmath144-type solutions are allowed if any . however , since @xmath148 for @xmath149 , the condition ( [ eqn : dev=0 ] ) excludes @xmath144-type solutions which are bounded in the region @xmath150 . on the other hand ,",
    "since the reversed potential @xmath125 is negative for @xmath151 and @xmath128 , the above heuristic interpretation in terms of a particle motion strongly suggests that , if there exists a solution of the differential equation , the solution should be bounded in the region @xmath150 .",
    "hence , we can conclude that there is no solution for @xmath146 .",
    "next , for @xmath152 , there is no root of the potential @xmath85 .",
    "hence , in this case there is no way to satisfy the boundary condition ( [ eqn : y3=root ] ) .",
    "therefore , there is no solution for @xmath153 , and it is actually enough to concentrate on the case @xmath79 as we did .",
    "we have proposed a simple five - dimensional brane world model , motivated by m - theory compactified on a six - dimensional manifold of small radius and an @xmath0 of large radius .",
    "we have included the leading - order higher curvature correction to the tree - level bulk action since in brane world scenarios the curvature scale in the bulk may be comparable to the five - dimensional planck scale and , thus , higher curvature corrections may become important . as a manageable model of the bulk theory",
    "we have considered pure gravity including a @xmath1ricci - scalar@xmath2-correction to the einstein - hilbert action .    in this model theory , after a conformal transformation to the einstein frame , we have numerically obtained static solutions , each of which consists of a positive tension brane and a negative tension brane .",
    "the solutions are parameterized by a dimensionless parameter @xmath95 in the bulk theory and @xmath96 , where @xmath71 is distance between two branes and @xmath74 is a length scale determined by the ( negative ) bulk cosmological constant .",
    "several solutions are shown in figures  [ fig : y1 - 10 ] , [ fig : y1 - 20 ] , [ fig : y1 - 30 ] , [ fig : y3 - 10 ] , [ fig : y3 - 20 ] and [ fig : y3 - 30 ] .    the warp factor and tension of both branes have been calculated for various values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 and , by eliminating @xmath96 , we have obtained two @xmath95-dependent relations between the warp factor and brane tensions .",
    "the existence of these relations implies that , contrary to the original randall - sundrum model , the so called radion is no longer a zero mode . in this sense ,",
    "the present model is similar to those in refs .",
    "the two relations completely determine the brane tensions as functions of the warp factor and are shown in figures  [ fig : tension1 ] and [ fig : tension2 ] . from these figures",
    "we conclude that the tension of our brane should be negative and that fine - tuning of the tension of both branes is necessary for a large warp factor to explain the large hierarchy between the planck scale and the electroweak scale . to be precise , the brane tensions should be fine - tuned with high accuracy to values shown in equations ( [ eqn : tension - asymptotics1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : tension - asymptotics2 ] ) .",
    "further , eliminating the warp factor from figures  [ fig : tension1 ] and [ fig : tension2 ] , we have obtained a relation between the brane tensions .",
    "it is shown in figure  [ fig : tension3 ] and can be considered as a necessary condition for the system with two branes to be static , or the condition for the four - dimensional cosmological constant to vanish .",
    "namely , unless this relation is satisfied , the system can not be static but becomes dynamical , regardless of initial conditions ( i.e. initial position of branes , initial velocity of branes , and so on ) .",
    "a stability analysis of solutions obtained in the present paper is an important topic for future work .",
    "here , we only offer a comment concerning this subject : we can not derive a correct effective action by simply substituting the solutions into the action .",
    "actually , if we substitute any static solutions into the action then the action vanishes because of the hamiltonian constraint . a simple illustration of this fact is given in appendix  [ app : action ] .",
    "several extensions of the present model may also be of interest for future work : ( i ) inflating brane solution ; ( ii ) cosmological solution ; ( iii ) inclusion of ricci tensor and weyl tensor contributions to the @xmath4-term in the action ; ( iv ) inclusion of a @xmath3-form field and modulus corresponding to the six - dimensional compactification .",
    "( i ) it is probably not difficult to extend the static solutions in the present paper to inflating brane solutions .",
    "the relation between brane tensions , corresponding to figure  [ fig : tension3 ] , is expected to become dependent on the four - dimensional cosmological constant induced on branes as well as the model parameter @xmath95 .",
    "( ii ) extension to cosmological solutions should be possible",
    ". this should not be as difficult as extension of the semiclassical solutions in ref .",
    "@xcite to cosmological solutions .",
    "the latter seems rather difficult because of the so called moving mirror effect  @xcite , which is non - local .",
    "on the other hand , the present model has a locally defined lagrangian density in five dimensions .",
    "hence , extension to the cosmological context is easier in the present model than in the model of ref.@xcite .",
    "moreover , the present model seems more realistic and , thus , worth while investigating in more detail .",
    "( iii ) although we have investigated effects of the @xmath1ricci - scalar@xmath2-correction only , it would be desirable to investigate effects of other forth - order curvature terms .",
    "note , however , that effects of forth - order weyl terms are probably less important insofar as we consider the metric ( [ eqn : ansatz ] ) or small perturbations around it , since the weyl tensor vanishes for the metric ( [ eqn : ansatz ] ) .",
    "( iv ) in the present model we have considered pure gravity in the bulk . however , more realistic model should include a @xmath3-form field existing in the bosonic sector of eleven dimensional supergravity as well as moduli fields due to the compactification from eleven dimensions to five dimensions .",
    "in this case , we may consider effects due to various eighth - order derivative terms other than @xmath4 terms .",
    "the author would like to thank professor w.  israel for continuing encouragement and careful reading of this manuscript .",
    "he would be grateful to professor j.  yokoyama and dr .",
    "t.  shiromizu for helpful discussions in the early stage of this work .",
    "in particular , the author would greatly appreciate professor j.  yokoyama for informing as to his interesting work on topological @xmath4 inflation  @xcite .",
    "this work is supported by cita national fellowship and the nserc operating research grant .",
    "by the ansatz ( [ eqn : ansatz ] ) , the action ( [ eqn : equivalent - action ] ) is reduced to @xmath154           - \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{d\\psi}{dw}\\right)^2      + \\tilde{u}(\\psi)\\right]\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integration with respect to @xmath52 in this expression is over the whole @xmath155 , and @xmath156 from this reduced action , the following equations of motion are derived . @xmath157",

    "\\label{eqn : reduced - eom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these are equivalent to equations ( [ eqn : e - eq ] ) , ( [ eqn : matching - cond ] ) and ( [ eqn : junction - cond ] ) , provided that the identification @xmath158 is imposed .",
    "we can estimate the value of the reduced action by using these equations .",
    "actually , the first of ( [ eqn : reduced - eom ] ) reduces the effective lagrangian density @xmath159 to @xmath160          + 3\\left[2\\left(\\frac{da}{dw}\\right)^2-\\frac{d^2a}{dw^2 }      \\right]\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\frac{1}{\\kappa^2}\\oint dw       \\frac{d}{dw}\\left(e^{-4a}\\frac{da}{dw}\\right )          = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the effective lagrangian density vanishes if a solution of equations of motion is substituted .",
    "this fact can be easily understood as follows  : in the static case without boundaries the lagrangian of the system is just minus the hamiltonian , which should vanish because of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the above arguments can be applied to the situation in ref .",
    "@xcite by simply replacing @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 with appropriate functions .",
    "since the above analysis indicates a vanishing effective potential , it is impossible to obtain a correct effective potential for the so called radion , which corresponds to @xmath71 in the above arguments , by simply substituting solutions to the action .",
    "it seems that the non - vanishing effective potential obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite merely measures an amount of inconsistency in their analysis .",
    "nonetheless , their conjecture that the radion can be stabilized by inclusion of a bulk scalar field seems correct if the backreaction of the scalar field to the geometry is sufficiently small  @xcite .",

    "<S> a simple five - dimensional brane world model is proposed , motivated by m - theory compactified on a six - dimensional manifold of small radius and an @xmath0 of large radius . </S>",
    "<S> we include a leading - order higher curvature correction to the tree - level bulk action since in brane world scenarios the curvature scale in the bulk may be comparable to the five - dimensional planck scale and , thus , higher curvature corrections may become important . as a tractable model of the bulk theory we consider pure gravity including a @xmath1ricci - scalar@xmath2-correction to the einstein - hilbert action . in this model theory , after a conformal transformation to the einstein frame , we numerically obtain static solutions , each of which consists of a positive tension brane and a negative tension brane . for these solutions , we obtain two relations between the warp factor and the brane tensions . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of these relations implies that , contrary to the original randall - sundrum model , the so called radion is no longer a zero mode . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the tension of our brane should be negative and that fine - tuning of the tension of both branes is necessary for a large warp factor to explain the large hierarchy between the planck scale and the electroweak scale . </S>"
