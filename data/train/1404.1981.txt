    "the most recent ieee wireless local area network ( wlan ) 802.11ad standard suggests that to achieve high throughput the devices must operate with ldpc codes . since a wlan mimo system is subject to multi - path propagation and mobility , this wireless system is characterized by time - varying channels with fluctuating signal strength . in applications subject to delay constraints and slowly - varying channels ,",
    "only limited independent fading realizations are experienced . in such conditions also known as non - ergodic scenarios ,",
    "the channel capacity is zero since there is an irreducible probability , termed outage probability @xcite , that the transmitted data rate is not supported by the channel .",
    "a simple and useful model that captures the essential characteristics of non - ergodic channels is the block - fading channel @xcite .",
    "it is especially important in wireless communications with slow time - frequency hopping ( e.g. , cellular networks and wireless local area networks ) or multi - carrier modulation using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) @xcite .",
    "codes designed for block - fading channels are expected to achieve the channel diversity and to offer good coding gains .",
    "a family of ldpc codes called root - check for block - fading channels was proposed in @xcite .",
    "root - check codes are able to achieve the maximum diversity of a block - fading channel and have a performance near the limit of outage when decoded using the sum product algorithm ( spa ) .",
    "root - check codes are always designed with code rate @xmath1 , since the singleton bound determines that this is the highest code rate possible to obtain the maximum diversity order @xcite .",
    "several works have been proposed to improve the coding gain , and to address problems such as low complexity encoding and even low memory storage .",
    "the most recent works in the literature in terms of root - check construction are found in @xcite .",
    "spatially multiplexed coded modulations that are decoded using iterative detection and decoding ( idd ) techniques can offer capacity - approaching performance .",
    "one seminal work that introduced the concept of idd schemes was reported in @xcite . in @xcite , it is proposed a low - complexity iterative multiuser receivers for coded code - division multiple - access ( cdma ) systems over multipath channels . it is shown that as the number of outer iteration ( the message exchanged between detector and decoder ) increase their scheme is capable to get close to the single user capacity . the work done in @xcite is essentially an extension of @xcite applied for multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) systems even though , it is suggested that scheme in @xcite is computationally more efficient than @xcite and it can be applied to multi - user detection .",
    "in @xcite , the authors proposed an mmse decision feedback ( df ) detector that employs a successive parallel arbitrated df structure based on the generation of parallel arbitrated branches .",
    "the motivation for that was to mitigate the effects of error propagation often found in interference cancellation structures .",
    "the results in @xcite showed for both uncoded and convolutionally encoded systems using viterbi and turbo decoding that the detection schemes proposed can offer considerable gains as compared to existing df and linear receivers .",
    "in @xcite it is proposed a cancellation technique to mitigate inter symbol interference ( isi ) and multiple access interference ( mai ) for frequency - selective mimo channels .",
    "moreover , the authors in @xcite have shown a scheme for channel estimation which is more realistic in terms of practical systems .",
    "the work done in @xcite proposes a sic strategy for mimo spatial multiplexing systems based on a structure with multiple interference cancellation branches .",
    "this multi - branch sic ( mb - sic ) structure employs multiple sic schemes in parallel and each branch detects the signal according to its respective ordering pattern . by selecting the branch which yields the estimates with the best performance according to the selection rule",
    ", the mb - sic detector , therefore , achieves higher detection diversity .",
    "a low - complexity multiple feedback successive interference cancellation ( mf - sic ) is proposed in @xcite for the uplink of multiuser mimo ( mu - mimo ) systems .",
    "also , the authors have made an extension of the work in @xcite to combine the mf - sic with mb - sic to achieve a higher detection diversity order .",
    "the results presented in @xcite show that their schemes significantly outperform the conventional sic scheme and approach the optimal detector .",
    "all the works previously mentioned deal with quasi - static rayleigh fading channels or even fast rayleigh fading channel .",
    "however , there is very little research in the literature related to the case of block - fading channels with mimo systems . to the best of our knowledge , the only work which discusses the mimo under block - fading channels is @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors claimed that using root - check ldpc codes the mimo system can achieve the desired channel diversity .",
    "furthermore , they presented a relationship between the maximum ldpc code rate and @xmath2 transmitting antennas is @xmath3 . in @xcite",
    ", it is only considered the direct application of root - check ldpc codes for mimo in block - fading channels .",
    "in contrast , in our work we discuss how we can improve the system performance based on the log likelihood ratio ( llr ) behaviour of a root - check ldpc code .",
    "we have observed that if we properly manipulate the llr output of the decoder and exploit the code structure we can obtain gains of up to @xmath4 with respect to non root - check ldpc codes in a idd system .",
    "moreover , we have considered several scenarios of mimo signalling .",
    "the main contribution of our work is to develop a novel idd scheme that exploits the code structure and provides a new strategy for llr manipulation that improves the performance of mimo idd systems under block - fading channels .",
    "furthermore , the improved performance noticed in block - fading channels instigated us to consider the case of fast - fading channels which also results in a better performance than traditional idd schemes .",
    "the most important aspect to be considered is that the gains provided by our proposed idd scheme do not require extra computationally effort or even any extra memory storage .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the system model . in section",
    "iii we discuss our proposed llr strategy .",
    "section iv it is depicted the simulation results , while section v concludes the paper .",
    "consider a root - check ldpc - coded mimo system with @xmath2 transmitter antennas and @xmath5 receiver antennas , signalling through a block fading channel , where @xmath6 is the number of independent fading blocks per codeword of length @xmath7 .",
    "the transmitter and receiver structure are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the data is first encoded by a root - check ldpc code with rate @xmath8 , modulated by a complex constellation with @xmath9 possible signal points and average energy equal to @xmath10 , and then distributed among the @xmath2 antennas .",
    "let @xmath11 be an @xmath12 vector of transmitted symbols and @xmath13 an @xmath14 vector of received signals related by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are related by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 returns the smallest integer not smaller than @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the @xmath24 real complex channel matrix with rayleigh fading coefficient of the @xmath18-th block and @xmath25 is a vector of independent zero - mean , complex gaussian noise entries with variance @xmath26 per real component . in the case of",
    "fast fading we assume that each received symbol @xmath13 will be under a distinct fading coefficient , which means @xmath27 .",
    "also we consider that the average signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at each receiver antenna is independent of the number of transmitter antennas @xmath2 .",
    "so , the snr can be defined as @xmath28 . in this paper , we assume that the transmitted symbols @xmath11 are taken from a modulation constellation @xmath29 .",
    "the information transmission rate is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the number of information bits per codeword of length @xmath7 . for the case of a block - fading channel ,",
    "we consider @xmath32 , since then it is possible to design a practical diversity achieving code @xcite .",
    "an idd scheme is used to approach the maximum - likelihood ( ml ) performance of joint mimo detection and ldpc decoding .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] gives a block diagram of the turbo iterative receiver structure . in this structure",
    ", the soft mimo detector incorporates extrinsic information provided by the ldpc decoder , and the ldpc decoder incorporates soft information provided by the mimo detector .",
    "extrinsic information between the detector and decoder is then exchanged in an iterative fashion until an ldpc codeword is found or a maximum number of iterations is performed .",
    "we will call inner iterations the iterations done by the log sum product ( sp ) ldpc decoder , and outer iterations the iterations between the decoder and the detector .      in the soft maximum a posteriori ( map ) detector",
    ", the received vector @xmath13 is demapped by llr calculation for each bit of the @xmath33 coded bits included in the transmit vector @xmath11 .",
    "the _ extrinsic _",
    "information provided by the map detector is the difference of the soft - input and soft - output llr values on the coded bits .",
    "for the t@xmath34 code bit @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) of the transmit vector @xmath11 , the extrinsic llr value of the estimated bit is computed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the extrinsic information of the bit @xmath35 computed by the ldpc decoder in the previous turbo iteration ( @xmath39 at the first iteration ) and @xmath40 is the set of @xmath41 vector hypotheses @xmath11 having @xmath42 , ( @xmath43 is similarly defined ) . assuming the bits within @xmath11 are statistically independent of one another , the _ a priori _",
    "probability @xmath44 can be written as @xmath45^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath46 corresponds to the value ( + 1,-1 ) of the j@xmath34 bit in the vector @xmath11 . in the above llr value calculation",
    ", the likelihood function @xmath47 is especified by a multivariate gaussian density function .",
    "the optimal detection algorithm is the maximum likelihood ( ml ) detection algorithm given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes a set of @xmath2-dimensional candidate vectors .",
    "the computational complexity , which increases exponentially with the number of transmit antennas , prevents the practical application of the ml detector .",
    "the mmse linear detector is a relatively simple strategy to separate the transmitted signals at the receiver .",
    "it corresponds to designing an @xmath50 parameter matrix @xmath51 according to the mmse criterion .",
    "the design of the mmse filter matrix @xmath51 is based on the minimization of the following cost function @xmath52,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 $ ] stands for the expected value and @xmath54 is the hermitian transpose operation . by computing the gradient of ( [ eq : mmse_cost_func ] ) with respect to @xmath51 and then equating it to a null matrix , we obtain the @xmath55 mmse filter matrix @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the noise variance , @xmath58 is the signal power and @xmath59 is the identity matrix .",
    "the mmse linear detector expression ( [ eq : mmse_filter_matrix ] ) requires the channel matrix @xmath60 ( in practice an estimate of it ) and the noise variance @xmath57 at the receiver .",
    "there are a number of other strategies to achieve the capacity gain of mimo systems in which the v - blast @xcite is the most competitive one because of its lower complexity and good performance .",
    "nevertheless , there is still a large performance gap between linear algorithms and ml - type detectors .",
    "the sic algorithm is usually combined with mmse filtering , resulting in v - blast @xcite receivers .",
    "this provides improved performance at the cost of increased computational complexity . rather than jointly decoding the transmitted signals",
    ", this nonlinear detection scheme first detects the first row of the signal and then cancels its effect from the overall received signal vector .",
    "it then proceeds to the next row .",
    "the reduced channel matrix now has dimension @xmath61 and the signal vector has dimension @xmath62 .",
    "it then does the same operation on the next row .",
    "the channel matrix now reduces to @xmath63 and the signal vector reduces to @xmath64 and so on .",
    "if we assume that all the decisions at each layer are correct , then there is no error propagation . otherwise , the error rate performance is dominated by the weakest stream , which is the first stream decoded by the receiver .",
    "hence , the improved diversity performance of the succeeding layers does not help . to get around this problem the ordered sic receiver",
    "was introduced @xcite . in this case , the signal with the strongest signal - to - interference - noise ( sinr ) ratio is selected for processing .",
    "this improves the quality of the decision and reduces the chances of error propagation .",
    "this is like an inherent form of selection diversity wherein the signal with the strongest snr is selected @xcite .",
    "we started by investigating the performance of the root - check ldpc codes under mimo systems with idd schemes .",
    "several simulations were conducted under different scenarios which lead to similar results , where root - check ldpc codes lose in terms of bit error rate ( ber ) to the standard ldpc codes at high snr .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ fig : llr_analisys ] will provide a set of sub - plots which are important to understand how our proposed idd scheme of llr strategy are devised .",
    "let us consider a simple scenario where the root - check ldpc codes are expected to obtain full diversity in a single input single output ( siso ) system .",
    "an arbitrary modulation was used , @xmath0 fadings per codeword , code rate @xmath65 , channel fading coefficients @xmath66 and @xmath67 , all null code word will be sent through the `` channel '' .",
    "for practical purposes , let us consider @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that there is no noise contribution from the receiver side for this particular experiment . as a result",
    ", we will be analysing only the influence of the fading under the soft decision at the decoder .",
    "the received code word will be , @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 leads to something like , @xmath73    moreover , applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : rcv_mod ] ) through a real system with a block length @xmath74 , the output of the decoder is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : llr_out_bpsk ] . from the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : llr_out_bpsk ] we can see clearly that the llr contribution of the second half of the systematic bits is marginal compared to the first half .",
    "each systematic half is under fadings @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "nevertheless , it was assumed that the root - check codes would be able to recover all the systematic bits under the same scenario discussed in this document .",
    "furthermore , we have investigated if we were properly generating a block - fading channel using a complex channel .",
    "what instigated us to conduct this analysis , it was based on the fact that from the decoder point of view the received symbols must be in a binary phase shift keying ( bpsk ) style .",
    "consequently , we have obtained the message llr output shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : llr_out_dec ] .    the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : llr_out_dec ] , suggest that it is not a block - fading @xmath0 behaviour .",
    "however , if we just multiply the channel matrix ( @xmath66 or @xmath67 ) to its complex conjugate to obtain the envelope of that channel realization , we obtain a proper block - fading channel as it can be seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : llr_out_dec_opt ] . we have noticed that the parity check nodes of a general root - check ldpc codes tend to not converge , which means in an idd process the extrinsic information exchanged between the decoder and the detector might not be fruitful in terms of improving the overall performance .",
    "one interesting approach is the controlled doping via high - order root - checks in graph codes presented in @xcite .",
    "the codes designed in @xcite are able to guarantee the parity check nodes converge .",
    "following the analysis done for a siso case we have now considered a mimo @xmath75 signalling system .",
    "the channel can be interpreted as a block - fading channel with @xmath0 , the ldpc code word has a block length of @xmath74 , maximum @xmath76 inner iterations and code rate @xmath77 .",
    "the root - check ldpc code used is the one presented in @xcite .",
    "the llr output of the decoder can be represented as : @xmath78 where @xmath35 is the t@xmath34 bit and @xmath79 is the _ a priori _ probability of the the t@xmath34 bit . at the first outer iteration @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore , we will be looking at the _ a posteriori _ llr output of the decoder .",
    "for the case of sic we have the symbols versus llr output as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : llr_output_non_comp ] . from the figure",
    ", we can see that the llr of the parity bits ( 600 up to 1200 ) half of then are about @xmath81 while the rest are even below @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , we have an average gap of @xmath83 in terms of llr .    we have adopted an llr processing scheme for idd with block - fading channels ( llr - ps - bf ) .",
    "we have observed that before calculating the extrinsic information for the next outer iteration , we calculate @xmath84 the reason why we have chosen the absolute maximum value of @xmath85 is whether we choose an arbitrary upper bound this leads to a degradation in the overall performance .",
    "accordingly , the final llr @xmath86 with respect to the parity check becomes : @xmath87 it must be noted that in ( [ eq : llr_output_mod ] ) every time the decoder generate an _ a posteriori _",
    "llr @xmath85 a new value for @xmath88 must be obtained .",
    "the main purpose of performing ( [ eq : llr_output_mod ] ) is to enable a convergence for the detector in the next outer iteration .",
    "therefore , the extrinsic message exchanged between the decoder and the detector will benefit from this operation .",
    "consequently , a better performance in terms of ber will be noticed . applying our proposed scheme llr - ps - bf to llr output",
    "obtained in fig .",
    "[ fig : llr_output_non_comp ] prior to the extrinsic information calculation , the final output is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : llr_output_comp ] .",
    "one can claim that it is not fair to only apply our method llr - sp - bf to the root - check ldpc codes and not to apply for their counterpart , for instance , irregular repeat accumulate ( ira ) ldpc codes .",
    "correspondingly , we can show in fig .",
    "[ fig : llr_out_non_comp_ira ] that in the case of ira ldpc code rate @xmath89 , with block length @xmath74 there is no gap on the parity bits llr .",
    "moreover , we have applied our technique to see if this would bring some improvements .",
    "however , it has caused a degradation on overall performance .",
    "for the sake of clarity , all results that will be presented in section [ sec : simul ] based on ira ldpc codes , we will not apply our method llr - sp - bf to avoid a degradation on overall performance .",
    "the structure of our proposed llr - ps - bf with soft cancellation detector is described in terms of iterations . in the first iteration ,",
    "the _ a priori _ information provided by the decoder is zero which heavily degrades the performance of pic based detection .",
