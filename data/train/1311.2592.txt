    "galactic globular clusters contain @xmath5 stars , yet until the 1970 s they generally were considered to be simple systems with members born at one epoch from chemically homogeneous gas .",
    "their actual complexity has been revealed as photometric and spectroscopic data have steadily increased in quality and quantity .",
    "we now know that in most ( all ? ) globular clusters ( gcs ) there are large star - to - star variations in all light elements that are susceptible to proton - capture fusion reactions ( li , c , n , o , na , mg , al ) . several clusters have internal variations in the heavy neutron - capture elements ( e.g. , y , zr , ba , la , eu ) . the large number of papers that have contributed to these conclusions have been discussed in several major reviews , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently attention has been drawn to the discovery of multiple color - magnitude sequences in several gcs , for example @xmath6 centauri @xcite , ngc  2808 @xcite , ngc  1851 @xcite , 47  tuc @xcite , ngc  6397 @xcite , and many others where we find evidence of multiple populations in the sgbs @xcite . in followup spectroscopic studies",
    "these split evolutionary sequences have been interpreted in to be due to metallicity variations ( e.g. , m22 , @xcite ) and helium abundance variations ( e.g. , @xmath6  cen , @xcite ; ngc  2808 , @xcite ) . an increasingly popular interpretation of the metallicity and abundance ratio inhomogeneities is in terms of multiple stellar generations with individual clusters ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . to determine whether the derived abundance variations are statistically significant or",
    "not , it is essential to attack these questions with large spectroscopic samples of high quality .",
    "several years ago our group targeted several clusters in spectroscopic surveys with the very large telescope ( vlt ) , in order to study their internal velocity dispersions ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 eso proposal , p.i .",
    "the spectra for these surveys were taken specifically to measure radial velocities , and at first glance they may seem not suitable for chemical composition analysis : the wavelength range is short ( @xmath9 214   ) , the spectra often are noisy ( @xmath10 ) in this spectral region ( centered at 5250   ) many lines are intrinsically blended or suffer for the limited resolving power of the instrument ( @xmath11 )    however , the spectra still contain much more information than just velocities . given the large number of stars observed ( several thousand per cluster ) and their great luminosity range ( from the upper red giant branch down to the main sequence ) we have tried a fresh approach to see what other spectroscopic information might be extracted in these clusters .",
    "we decided to concentrate only on our m4 dataset to develop the new analytical methods .",
    "m4 ( ngc  6121 ) is a bright , well - populated , mildly metal - poor galactic gc . it is usually regarded as the gc nearest to the sun : @xmath12  = 1.8  kpc @xcite , 1.7  kpc @xcite and 2.2  kpc @xcite .",
    "the closeness of m4 makes its upper red - giant branch ( rgb ) accessible to high - resolution spectroscopy with medium - large telescopes : at the red - giant tip , @xmath13  @xmath14 11.8 , and at the horizontal branch ( hb ) @xmath13  @xmath14 13.5 .",
    "however , m4 lies between the sun and galactic center and consequently suffers significant interstellar extinction , @xmath15  @xmath16 1.3  mag . additionally , this extinction is variable over the cluster face ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and so transformations of colors and magnitudes into luminosities and temperatures are not straightforward .",
    "evidences of multiple generations have been found in the rgb @xcite and hb @xcite , and the presence of two distinct sequences in the rgb has been confirmed by @xcite .",
    "comprehensive high - resolution spectroscopic investigations of atmospheric parameters , metallicities , and abundance ratios in m4 red giants have been conducted for several decades by several author groups , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the metallicity of m4 now appears to be well determined at [ fe / h ]  @xmath14 @xmath171.15 with a range from individual studies of @xmath18 0.15 ( @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this cluster has been studied extensively in an attempt to understand its blue cn bandstrength bi - modality ( @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there also have been several high - resolution spectroscopic studies that have focused on star - to - star the behavior of more limited element groups : na , al , and o , @xcite ; li , @xcite , @xcite ; na in hb stars , @xcite ; k , @xcite ; neutron - capture elements , @xcite ; he , @xcite .",
    "recent efforts have been concentrated in systematic abundances analysis of large sample of stars with comparison with the theoretical yelds of elements to identify the origins of the multiple populations , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "here is a partial list of questions we hoped to answer with our m4 spectroscopic data .",
    "* can temperatures and gravities derived from spectra be mapped reliably onto the color - magnitude quantities ?",
    "are the scatters in these relationships readily understood in terms of the uncertainties in both sets of quantities ?",
    "* is the derived metallicity the same at the rgb tip and the ms ? is the star - to - star metallicity scatter compatible with the uncertainties , or is there evidence for a genuine variation such as seen in m22 ? * can efficient , physically defensible , and automated algorithms be developed for these data that have general applicability to other cluster data sets ? *",
    "is it possible to get interesting abundance ratios from these spectra ? *",
    "can the velocity information ( stellar binarity , overall velocity dispersion , cluster rotation ) derived by @xcite be improved ?    in this work , we will focus on the parameter atmosphere determination of m4 stars . a companion paper ( malavolta et al .",
    ", in preparation ) will discuss derivation of new , very precise radial velocities in this cluster .",
    "the spectra analyzed in this study were originally presented by @xcite for an investigation of the internal velocity dispersion and binary fraction of m4 .",
    "the data were gathered with the vlt fibre large array multi element spectrograph ( flames ; @xcite ) employed with the giraffe medium - high resolution spectrograph in medusa multi - fiber mode . in this configuration",
    "one can obtain single - order spectra for 132 objects ( target stars and sky ) in each integration .",
    "the giraffe hr9 setup was chosen , which produces spectroscopic dispersion of 0.05   / pixel and measured 4-pixel resolving power r  @xmath19  @xmath20 , in the wavelength range 5143    @xmath21 5356   .",
    "this spectral region is characterized by a large number of lines , many of them blended , and the presence of the strong  b triplet .",
    "the m4 target stars were selected from an astrometric and photometric catalog based on wide field imager ( wfi ) data from the eso / mpia 2.2 m telescope @xcite .",
    "the original selection criterion was that each star had no neighbors with @xmath22 within an angular distance of @xmath23 ( the fiber radius is @xmath24 ) . since the original radial velocity survey goal was to search for spectroscopic binaries ,",
    "almost all the stars have multi - epoch observations .    for our analysis ,",
    "extensive photometric data for m4 have been kindly provided by peter stetson ( private communication ) from his comprehensive catalog of homogeneous broadband photometry for milky way clusters and dwarf spheroidals .",
    "the basic description of that project is reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "photometry for over 70,000 m4 stars in broadband @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath13 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 was obtained in a multi - year effort involving many telescope / instrument combinations , as summarized in @xcite .",
    "nearly all of the stars have both @xmath26 and @xmath13 measurements , about 76% also have @xmath27 measurements , but only about 43% were observed in the @xmath28 passband .",
    "photometry of a subset of nearly 800 m4 stars has been made publicly available as part of stetson s `` photometric standard fields '' , and most of those stars are included in our large catalog .",
    "the magnitudes given in the public database are consistent with those that we are using .        .",
    "]    spatial properties of our target stars are illustrated in figure  [ fig : cmd_map ] , where the targets are color - coded according to the number of spectra available for a given star .",
    "the cluster core radius ( where the surface luminosity has decreased by a factor of two from the center ) and the half - light radius are also drawn in this figure , indicating that essentially all regions of m4 has been sampled spectroscopically .",
    "all the observed stars are inside the tidal radius of the cluster ( not shown in the figures ) .",

    "the limiting magnitude of the targets , @xmath31  17.5 , has been set by the requirement that a single m4 integration had @xmath32 for each star in a single observation . although horizontal branch stars are present in our dataset , they have been excluded from the analysis . we think that their higher temperature respect to the rest of the sample and their evolved status requires a more careful analysis that is beyond the goal of this paper .",
    "a total of 2771 stars covering color - magnitude diagram positions from the upper red - giant branch to about one magnitude fainter than the main - sequence ( ms ) turnoff ( to ) luminosity have been observed .",
    "the spectra span a temporal period of six years , and we refer to @xcite for a description of the observation strategy .",
    "we added 306 new spectra obtained in 2009 that targeted ms stars already observed in the previous epochs . since these data originally were gathered to determine the m4 velocity dispersion and to assess the binary - star fraction , nearly all stars have been observed at least twice , and three or more spectra have been obtained for nearly 40% of the sample .",
    "we summarize the observation numbers in table  [ tab - nobs ] ; a total of 7250 individual spectra have been used in our study .",
    "@xcite used the eso giraffe standard reduction pipeline @xcite to reduce the m4 data from raw ccd exposures to final extracted , flat - fielded , wavelength - calibrated spectra . in order to maximize the information content of these spectra",
    ", we decided to revisit the reductions , paying particular attention to spectral extraction and wavelength calibration .",
    "we adapted the _ empirical point spread function _",
    "concept from photometry @xcite to spectroscopy to obtain a more accurate determination of the cross - dispersion spread function of the fibres .",
    "the use of a more accurate profile results in a reduction of the noise for spectra at low  when using the optimal spectral extraction algorithm , as shown by @xcite .",
    "wavelength calibration has been performed with an alternative technique as well .",
    "precise rv determination from giraffe data is the subject of a forthcoming paper , and it will not be discussed here .",
    "+        degradation of the   with magnitude is demonstrted in figure  [ fig : cmd_nored ] by showing representative spectra of stars with different magnitudes .",
    "these spectra have been chosen , among target stars of similar magnitude , to be the best exposed during observing runs without moon illumination .",
    "other spectra at the same magnitude can have lower  depending on exposure times and observational conditions .",
    "m4 giraffe spectra have been gathered in such a way that each individual exposure has a minimum greater than 10 , since this value is considered the lower limit to obtain radial velocity with a precision of a few hundreds m / s with this instrument @xcite .",
    "however , atmospheric stellar parameter and abundance derivation at stellar fluxes that are comparable to the noise level requires very careful handling of the spectra . the usual procedure is to process the observed stellar flux as much as possible in order to be comparable with the synthesis : sky contribution is subtracted , spectra are corrected by flat - fielding , normalized and finally rebinned in a linear wavelength scale .",
    "every step in this procedure will produce an increase or an unintended correlation in the noise level of the observed spectrum .",
    "fortunately , this problem is usually negligible when working on spectra with good , but it can lead to a significant loss in precision in stellar atmospheric parameter determination when the  is very low this is exactly the situation we face with the majority of our observed spectra .",
    "after many numerical experiments with our data , we adopted a new approach to handle the spectrum preparations . specifically , after extraction and wavelength calibration of the raw spectra , we decided not to perform any subsequent data corrections .",
    "we made this choice in order to avoid introduction of any false correlations into the spectrum noise .",
    "all the steps that usually lead to sky - corrected , rest - frame , continuum - normalized stellar spectra were instead performed in the opposite direction : deliberate degradation of the `` perfect '' synthetic spectra to best match the real extracted spectra .",
    "each of these steps is described in detail in the next few sections . however , application to each spectrum was done in a near - simultaneous fashion , so here we give an outline of our overall procedure , referring to the sections in which each procedure is developed .    in the following ,",
    "we use the term _ exposure _ to refer to a single observation for a given star . for every exposure of the star under study ,",
    "the synthesis to be compared is subject to these transformations :    * the synthesis is moved in the radial velocity space to match the measured total radial velocity shift of the exposure ( i.e. , star heliocentric motion plus the earth motion ) ; * the level of sky flux , composed of a scattered solar ( moonlight ) spectrum and a _ gray _ continuum are determined ( section  [ sec : sky_flux ] ) ; * the appropriate continuum slope function for the exposure is derived ( section  [ sec : cont_norm_flux ] ) : * preliminary stellar atmospheric parameters are deduced from photometric data ( section  [ sec : atmos ] ) : * synthetic spectra appropriate to these parameters are computed ( section  [ sec : spectral - synthesis ] ) . *",
    "both synthetic and solar spectra are degraded to the resolution of the instrument , determined from the th - ar exposures , using a gaussian kernel ; * the synthetic spectrum , solar spectrum and gray continuum are rebinned in the wavelength scale of the exposure , keeping constant the amount of flux for unitary wavelength ; * the rebinned synthesis and sky spectra are multiplied for their continuum function , and together with the rebinned gray continuum they are linearly combined using as coefficient the corresponding flux constants , as determined in section  [ sec : sky_flux ] and section  [ sec : cont_norm_flux ] .",
    "* the resulting spectrum is multiplied for the flat - field of the fiber used to gather the data to include instrumental effects , such as the characteristic efficiency curve along an order ( _ blaze _ function ) in echelle spectrograph .",
    "we call the result of these operations the _ processed synthesis _ to distinguish it from the raw synthesis described in section  [ sec : spectral - synthesis ] . since every exposure differs from the others due to different observational conditions , variations in the instrument response , moon illumination etc",
    ". this process must be performed for every exposure of a star , and any exposure can be compared only with the relative processed synthesis . as a final comment here",
    ", stars in gcs are known to be slow rotators , so the effects of possible rapid rotation are not considered in computing the the processed synthetic spectra .",
    "nevertheless it would be very easy to incorporate this effect in the analysis , as well as determining the best fitting @xmath33sin@xmath34  value during the @xmath35 minimization .",
    "for every giraffe exposure on the m4 targets , about 5 - 10 fibers have been allocated to empty sky regions .",
    "sky subtraction is usually performed by coadding the spectra from these fibers and subtracting the result from the observed spectrum of the star .",
    "there are several drawbacks when doing so :    * these spectra are intrinsically very noisy , having the sky a maximum brightness of @xmath36 at @xmath37 from full moon .",
    "even when coadded , the resulting spectrum is still very noisy , then increasing significantly the noise of the sky - subtracted spectra especially in those cases where star and sky fluxes are comparable . *",
    "each fiber has a different transmission efficiency .",
    "the error in its determination is propagated when the sky spectra have to be coadded , and when the coadded spectrum is subtracted from the star spectra . *",
    "sky spectra must be rebinned to a common wavelength scale to be coadded , then either the science spectra must be rebinned to this common scale or the coadded sky spectrum must be rebinned in the science spectra wavelength scale , in order to perform the sky subtraction correctly .",
    "the rebinning of a low  spectrum can introduce correlated noise and should be avoided .",
    "* several fibers must be allocated for the sky spectra , reducing the efficiency of a multiplexing instrument such as giraffe . *",
    "even if the allocated sky fibers are scattered around the field of view , the coadded spectrum wil not be sensitive to any spatial variability of the sky and the individual spectra are too noisy and their number too low to determine it over the @xmath38 covered by a medusa plate .",
    ", obtained a few days before full moon .",
    "the synthetic sky spectrum ( red line ) , stellar spectrum ( blue line ) and a grey continuum ( green line ) here shown with instrumental effects already applied , are combined ( magenta line ) and compared to the observed stellar spectrum ( black points ) .",
    "the upper panel shows the entire wavelength range of our spectra , while lower panel shows the  b triplet region , to highlight the contribution of the sky spectrum to the observed total star+sky spectrum . ]",
    "since many of the observing runs occurred in gray / bright moon time , the sky spectrum constitutes a significant part of the flux .",
    "an example is given in figure  [ fig : spectra_faint ] where the observed spectrum of a relatively faint program star ( @xmath39 ) is decomposed into the stellar ( blue line ) and the sky ( red line ) contributions .",
    "the spectrum in the figure was taken on 2006 september 04 , @xmath40 days before full moon and at a distance of @xmath41 . in analyzing the coadded sky spectrum we discovered that the sky light was composed of two distinct parts : one resembling the solar spectrum , due manly to the presence of the moon , and another featureless",
    "one ( green line ) .",
    "this gray feature was first noticed in sky spectra taken during dark time , i.e.   without moon illumination , and confirmed to be necessary when trying to fit the coadded sky spectra from moon - illuminated nights with the solar spectrum .",
    "intrinsic sky brightness due to zodiacal light and human light pollution ( see * ? ? ? * ) or the presence of scattered light inside the dome are both plausible explanations .",
    "we limit ourselves to taking account of this feature , without investigating its origin .",
    "one can see clear evidence in figure  [ fig : spectra_faint ] of sky contamination in the star s",
    "low  spectrum , especially in the strong  b lines ( lower panel ) .",
    "we note that fortunately in our spectral range no telluric absorption lines are present , so no correction for that potential problem is needed .",
    "the inclusion of the sky in the correct proportion with respect to the stellar flux is a fundamental part of a good synthesis match of the data . to determine the sky flux level , we proceed in the following way . the extracted and wavelength - calibrated sky spectra are corrected for fiber transmission and flat - field normalization .",
    "then the amount of sky flux per unit wavelength is determined by integrating the sky spectra over 2    intervals ; this value has been chosen as a good compromise between reducing the noise and preserving the main spectral features of the spectra .    in order to account for the loss of flux due to solar spectral lines , we employed the u.s",
    ". national solar observatory ( nso ) flux atlas ( @xcite , @xcite ) , smoothing it to the spectral resolution of our data .",
    "this solar model is integrated in the same way as described in the preceding paragraph .",
    "the values determined from the observed sky spectrum are fitted with a linear combination of two functions : a low - order polynomial multiplied by the values from the solar model , to take into account the moon illumination , and a constant for the gray continuum .",
    "the resulting functions represent the continuum flux per unit wavelength as a function of the wavelength of the moon illumination and the gray continuum level , respectively .",
    "the former function is split in two parts : a constant representing the average flux of the sky , and a normalized function for the shape",
    ". we will refer to them as _ flux constant _ and _ continuum function _ respectively .",
    "since the gray continuum is a constant , its continuum function is simply a unitary constant value ( before including instrumental effects )    the coefficients of the functions as derived above represent only the first step in the sky flux derivation . during the continuum determination process , described in the next section ,",
    "the flux constants are refined using the sky lines in the spectrum as a proxy , to take into account the sky variability and fiber transmission differences .",
    "precautions to ensure that the extra absorptions in a faint stellar spectrum are truly sky contributions and not accidental inclusion of some faint non - cluster member star in the fiber apertures have been taken .",
    "not only must the mean sky radial velocities are consistent with a rest velocity system , but their fluxes positively must correlate with lunar phase . we have also rejected individual sky spectra that had anomalously high flux , indicative of accidental pointing at a faint star .",
    "these procedures convinced us of the real nature of the sky contaminations to our stellar spectra .",
    "continuum rectification proved to be challenging due to the restricted total wavelength range ( 5140@xmath175360   ) of our spectra and to the presence of the strong  b absorption lines in the first 50    of the spectra . the giraffe hr9 setting was deliberately chosen for the original @xcite study to take advantage of the line richness in this spectral region .",
    "in addition to the  b lines there are many strong lines , which makes this wavelength domain particularly attractive for radial velocity studies . but this wealth of absorption lines creates many wavelength intervals of overlapping spectral features , so defining an adequate number of points for a _",
    "global _ continuum normalization is a very difficult task .",
    "local normalization , usually determined by visual inspection when measuring equivalent widths , is also unsuitable for two reasons : the large number of spectra in our sample ; and the subjectivity in manually selecting the continuum ( which probably would have introduced a systematic bias in our lower  spectra ) .",
    "spectral synthesis requires good normalization in the whole wavelength range of interest , and while is still feasible to manually adjust the continuum to match the synthesis when the number of stars is low , for our very large sample we had to find an alternative way .    a first estimate of the continuum stellar flux per unit wavelength is determined in a similar way as done for the sky flux .",
    "the sky and grey continuum contributions are removed from the observed spectra .",
    "then for each star we adopt a synthetic spectrum with photometric atmosphere parameters ( section  [ sec : atmos ] ) and provisional metallicity @xmath42$}}}=-1.15 $ ] ( section  [ sec : intro ] ) to calculate the _ flux constant _ and _ continuum function _ relative to the stellar component of the spectrum , following the same steps described in section  [ sec : sky_flux ] for the sky continuum .",
    "the synthetic stellar spectra and the solar spectra are degraded to match the spectral resolution of the instrument and together with the unitary function for the gray continuum they are rebinned into the wavelength scale of the science spectrum , keeping constant the flux per wavelength unit .",
    "all spectra are then multiplied for the corresponding continuum function and the resulting spectra are linearly combined , using the flux constants as coefficients .",
    "the instrumental effects ( e.g.  multiplication for flat - field ) are finally applied to make the comparison with the observed spectrum possible .",
    "the flux constants are determined by fitting the resulting model spectrum to the observed one by @xmath35 minimization ( equation  [ eq : spec_chi2 ] ) , in the same way as we do to determine the atmosphere stellar parameters ( section  [ sec : abun_an ] ) .",
    "small adjustments in the continuum functions also are allowed , to deal with spectral regions affected by the wings of strong spectral lines , e.g.  in the proximity of the  b triplet .",
    "a binary mask is included in the @xmath35 determination to exclude points too sensitive to variations of temperature , gravity , microturbulence and metallicity .",
    "this mask is derived by taking two boundary values for each stellar parameter ( i.e.   the photometric value @xmath43 its estimated error ; see section  [ sec : atmos ] ) and flagging those points that show a percentage variation over a fixed threshold .",
    "a detailed explanation is given in section  [ sec : abun_an ] .",
    "points that have normalized flux lower than @xmath44 in the stellar synthesis are excluded too , while the lines in the sky spectrum are retained to allow a better determination of the sky flux level .",
    "the flux continuum functions and the flux constants are adjusted as described above for each set of stellar atmosphere parameters used during the @xmath35 determination , so that the derived values will not be influenced by the initial choice in the photometric parameters for the continuum determination .",
    "a good starting point however allows a quick recalibration of this function .",
    "radial velocity shifts due to the intrinsic velocity of the star and the earth motion are applied to the stellar synthetic spectrum .",
    "no rebinning of the observed spectra is necessary , and no noise is introduced since all the operations are performed on noise - free high - resolution synthetic spectra .",
    "in every minimization algorithm , a good starting point always results in a faster determination of the variable of interest .",
    "spectral synthesis is a very lengthy process by itself , and with four parameters to be determined by @xmath35 minimization and several thousands of stars to be analyzed , this task can be excessively time - consuming .",
    "greater speed in this process can be provided through initialization of the process with photometrically derived stellar parameters , but some precautions are necessary .",
    "m4 is known to have both a large mean reddening , @xmath45 @xcite , and large differential reddening across its surface .",
    "we have adopded the latest determination of overall m4 parameters derived by @xcite ; these are listed in table  [ tab - parameters ] .",
    "we have corrected the @xmath46 cmd for differential reddening using the technique described in @xcite ; here we summarize their method .",
    "the reddening direction in the cmd is defined as @xmath47 .",
    "a subsample of the photometric catalog is identified by manually excluding those stars that lie clearly outside the cluster sequences , and including only those stars in the rgb , sgb and to , since the angle between the reddening direction and the sequences is maximum ( the reddening direction is almost parallel to the ms ) . a fiducial line along the rgb , sgb and to is manually determined and then for every star in the catalog the median shift in the reddening direction with respect to the fiducial line of the 35 closest stars of the subsample is computed .",
    "this value is taken as indicative of the amount of the differential reddening , taking advantage of the fact that stars in a local spatial region ( a few @xmath48 ) of m4 all should be shifted by the same amount .",
