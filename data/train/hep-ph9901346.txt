    "the quantum numbers of the known fermions under the standard - model gauge structure allow their partial classification under the fundamental representations of the corresponding symmetry groups .",
    "this motivates efforts to complete this classification by studying unifying symmetry groups large enough to accommodate all the fundamental - particle generations which have been observed so far .",
    "apart from the purely theoretical interest in such a possibility , quests for such a unification usually lead to predictions on the existence of new particles , like extra fermions and gauge bosons @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in particular , the new fermions are usually referred to as the  mirror partners \" of the standard - model fermions .",
    "since there are currently several theoretical and possibly also some experimental indications hinting for the existence of physics beyond the standard model at scales on the order of 1 tev @xcite , it is worthwhile investigating whether extensions of particle theories in a direction compatible with generation unification could be related to these indirect indications at tev - energy scales . furthermore , in view of the fact that accelerators designed to operate in the next decade plan to cover such high energies , it is quite important to investigate their discovery potential by producing directly the particles predicted by the aforementioned extensions .    before embarking in such a detailed production - and - decay study however",
    ", one should first check the internal consistency of the proposed theories and their compatibility with current experimental constrains . a first effort to reproduce the observed charged - fermion mass hierarchy , the quark mixing matrix elements and the weak scale while staying in agreement with the electro - weak precision data within such a framework",
    "was recently presented @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to tackle some related , equally important open issues .",
    "one of these issues is to calculate the evolution of the gauge couplings to very high energies , in order to see if there is a sequence of symmetry breakings consistent with the unification picture which motivated the proposed extension in the first place . in all cases discussed ,",
    "the symmetries in question are taken to break spontaneously , and getting into the details of the breaking mechanism , like it being of dynamical or fundamental nature and the transformation properties of its non - zero vacuum - expectation - value , is avoided because this usually involves a high degree of arbitrariness and speculation in an area of no phenomenological input .",
    "since the energy scales of these breakings could be associated with the lightness of the standard - model neutrinos via the see - saw mechanism , the question of neutrino masses and mixings left open in @xcite has to be studied next .",
    "this also allows the calculation of novel  oblique \" contributions to the electro - weak parameters due to the possible majorana nature of the mirror neutrinos .",
    "an effort to address these different but closely related issues follows next .",
    "the starting point of the discussion could be either of the unification gauge groups @xmath0 or @xmath1 without change in the final results , with gauge couplings @xmath2 and @xmath3 corresponding to the groups with subscripts 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "these symmetries are taken to break at the unification scale @xmath4 down to @xmath5 .",
    "the fermions and mirror fermions of interest transform under the above groups like @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "it is imagined next that around the same unification scale , @xmath8 breaks to its diagonal subgroup @xmath9 , which has accordingly a gauge coupling at that scale equal to @xmath10 this in its turn is taken to break again at @xmath4 to its maximal subgroup @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , @xmath12 could be taken to break down at the same scale to either of the three groups @xmath13 , @xmath14 , or @xmath15 . under the resulting group @xmath16 for instance , the standard - model - type fermions transform like four copies (  generations \" ) of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and the mirror fermions like @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the two other possibilities will be discussed in subsection 2.4 . in all these cases",
    "it is assumed that the fourth generation standard - model - type fermions pair - up with their mirror partners , acquiring gauge - invariant masses on the order of the @xmath15 breaking scale .",
    "( this is @xmath4 for the first two cases and about 1 tev for the third case , as will be seen in subsection 2.4 . )",
    "one first notes that the only way to unify the generation - group coupling with the other gauge couplings is to satisfy the relation @xmath21 at @xmath4 , because then the common unification coupling is @xmath22 according to eq .",
    "1 . therefore ,",
    "the generation group @xmath23 , which is taken to break completely at @xmath4 , is strongly coupled at that scale .",
    "the situation with generation group @xmath13 with coupling @xmath3 is first investigated .",
    "the basis of the analysis of the gauge - coupling renormalization that follows is more of a qualitative nature and limited to the one - loop @xmath24-function , due to the many uncertainties of the dynamics influencing the running of these couplings .",
    "these are mainly due not only to our ignorance of the exact masses of the mirror fermions and of the type of new physics needed to break the gauge groups involved in this picture , which could be higgs particles in various presently unpredictable representations , but also to the possible existence of supersymmetric partners of the standard - model fermions and to threshold effects near the unification scale .",
    "these uncertainties lead one to take all the mirror fermions to have the same mass @xmath25 at around 1 tev for simplicity , since the coupling unification is found to be anyway quite insensitive to this scale .",
    "below @xmath25 the couplings evolve like in the standard model . above that scale",
    ", one has to take the mirror fermions into account .",
    "it is then assumed that there exists a  desert \" between @xmath25 and the pati - salam scale @xmath26 where @xmath27 is broken , with no new dynamics or particles able to influence the evolution of the gauge couplings with energy .",
    "the @xmath24-function describing the evolution of the gauge coupling @xmath28 of an @xmath29 group with @xmath30 fermion @xmath31-plets with respect to momentum @xmath32 is given by @xmath33    where @xmath34 stands for higher - than - one - loop corrections and @xmath35 is some reference scale .",
    "if the same fermions transform also under the fundamental representation of another unitary gauge group @xmath36 with coupling @xmath37 much larger than @xmath28 , the quantity @xmath34 at two loops is approximately given by @xcite @xmath38    therefore , when the @xmath13 interactions become strong at around 2 tev and break @xmath39 dynamically by an effective higgs mechanism induced by fermion condensates @xcite , the corresponding fine - structure - constant is @xmath40 .",
    "one therefore gets @xmath41 , which is still much smaller than the one - loop contribution to the other couplings , even for the smaller groups considered like @xmath42 or @xmath43 ( the influence of the other couplings to each other is of course even more negligible due to their smallness ) .",
    "in addition , since @xmath13 is taken to break just after it becomes strong @xcite , it has a rather limited energy region where it can influence substantially the @xmath24 functions of interest , so large deviations from the one - loop renormalization of the rest of the gauge couplings are not expected .",
    "this issue is investigated further by presenting a particular example in subsection 2.3 .",
    "moreover , a fundamental higgs mechanism for breaking @xmath13 is avoided by evoking the mechanism conjectured in the appendix of @xcite . in any case , a minimal fundamental higgs mechanism breaking the generation symmetry , apart from all the naturalness problems it carries with it , would make the corresponding gauge coupling run slightly slower",
    ". the generation - coupling unification with the rest of the gauge couplings at @xmath4 would then still be achievable by slightly lowering the maximal value this coupling reaches before @xmath13 breaks and/or lowering the mirror - mass scale @xmath25 .",
    "an effort to estimate the energy scales entering this problem without fundamental scalars is presented in the next subsection .",
    "however simple , the approach adopted allows to draw general conclusions , not depending on particular details , on the way the unification groups break down to the standard - model gauge structure .",
    "it has to be stressed nevertheless that the class of symmetry - breaking channels of interest here has an additional degree of freedom compared to the usual or to the supersymmetric unification , and that is the pati - salam symmetry breaking scale @xmath26",
    ". this can be in most cases slightly adjusted to allow unification of couplings even after the correct inclusion of these corrections , unless one introduces unnaturally large higgs sectors to break the gauge symmetries .",
    "the results that follow should therefore be seen not as exact predictions but rather as order - of - magnitude estimates .",
    "the analysis presented here is based on different alternative breakings of the gauge symmetry @xmath27 , since _ a priori _ there is no obvious reason to expect a specific breaking channel .",
    "the subsequent analysis will show that only one alternative seems to be viable if one takes proton - lifetime bounds and the order of magnitude of the weak scale into consideration .",
    "it is particularly interesting therefore to note that , under certain assumptions , current phenomenological input is able to constrain the number of different group - breaking channels , even when these appear at scales much higher than the ones directly accessible at present .",
    "in particular , the pati - salam group is taken to break at the scale @xmath26 either along the channel @xmath44 or along the channel @xmath45 if the breaking @xmath46 has already occurred at @xmath4 .",
    "a third possibility is also examined , namely one of a pati - salam symmetry breaking like @xmath47 at @xmath4 , which is followed by the breaking of @xmath48 at scale @xmath49 . in all these alternative scenarios ,",
    "the pati - salam 4-plets are each broken to a qcd triplet and a lepton , while simultaneously giving rise to a  predecessor \" of the electromagnetic charge .",
    "it is also noted that , as a first approximation , below the mirror - mass threshold scale @xmath25 the couplings of all the non - abelian groups except for the generation group are taken to evolve with @xmath50 like in the standard model , and above @xmath25 with @xmath51 , the doubling being caused by the the existence of mirror fermions which leads to an abrupt change in slope to the running of the couplings at that scale .",
    "the eventual top - quark decoupling and the mixing between ordinary and mirror fermions , which apart from the top - quark is quite small , is thus also neglected .",
    "the @xmath13 coupling evolves at all scales with @xmath52 .",
    "these @xmath30 values are the same for all three pati - salam breaking channels considered .",
    "it is more convenient to work in the following with the inverse structure constants @xmath53 since their evolution is linear with @xmath54 .",
    "the value of the hypercharge coupling @xmath55 in the first two cases is computed via the relation @xmath56 which is evaluated at the pati - salam scale @xmath26 , where @xmath57 is the coupling corresponding to @xmath58 or @xmath59 respectively . in the third case the hypercharge coupling is given by the relation @xmath60 furthermore , the first and third cases are based on the working assumption of unbroken discrete left - right symmetry above the scale where @xmath58 is broken , i.e. @xmath61 . as was said in the introduction , a discussion on the possible breaking mechanisms of these symmetries is here avoided , since the purpose of the analysis is to allow general qualitative conclusions to be drawn .",
    "+ [ fig : fig1 ]     + [ fig : fig1a ]     + [ fig : fig4 ]    the starting point of the calculation is based on the approximate experimental values for these quantities listed below @xcite @xmath62 moreover , at scale @xmath25 the @xmath13 coupling is taken to be equal to @xmath63 .",
    "this coupling is not plotted for @xmath64 , because then higher - order corrections to the renormalization of this coupling become important .",
    "this is expected to have a limited effect to the other couplings however , since the generation group breaks at around the same scale .",
    "this issue is examined again later .",
    "the evolution of the inverse fine - structure constants @xmath65 for the various couplings @xmath66 of the groups @xmath43 , @xmath42 , @xmath67 , @xmath13 , @xmath27 and @xmath58 corresponding to the three different breaking channels mentioned above are plotted consecutively in figures 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "the relevant scales for which unification is possible , along with the value of the unification coupling are also given in table 1 .

    "the energy scales of interest are found to be @xmath81 gev and @xmath82 gev in the first case , and @xmath83 gev and @xmath84 gev in the second .",
    "the corresponding unification scales and couplings are found to be @xmath85 gev and @xmath86 in the first case , and @xmath87 gev and @xmath88 in the second .",
    "one can see at the scale @xmath26 in figs . 1 and 2",
    "the characteristic change in slope of the pati - salam coupling when the group @xmath27 breaks down to @xmath67 , which is due to the different quadratic casimirs of their adjoint representations , as well as the starting of the hypercharge - coupling running at that scale , since at scales higher than @xmath26 , @xmath43 is embedded in other groups .",
    "the inclusion of a minimal higgs field able to break these symmetries spontaneously would for the same @xmath4 slightly shift @xmath26 downwards since it would slow down somewhat the running of the pati - salam coupling .",
    "it is clear from the figures that , with the present fermion content , the slopes of the gauge couplings do not favor @xmath89 unification .",
    "also , the slope of @xmath42 below @xmath25 speaks against the addition of new weak - singlet fermions , as is usually done in universal see - saw models @xcite , if one seeks coupling unification .",
    "the third alternative breaking sequence is as already said to break the pati - salam group at the unification group like @xmath90 , and have later the breaking @xmath91 at scale @xmath49 .",
    "this possibility is drawn in figure 3 .",
    "the relevant scales are found to be @xmath92 gev , @xmath93 gev and @xmath94 gev .",
    "the scale @xmath49 with the present fermion content is quite large ( compare for instance solutions with alternative fermion contents @xcite ) , supporting a see - saw mechanism for the neutrino masses .",
    "the unification scale is in this case quite large , a result reminiscent of @xcite , and the common coupling at that scale is @xmath95 .",
    "the main reason for the largeness of @xmath25 is the effort to unify the generation - group gauge coupling with the other couplings .",
    "if this unification condition is relaxed , in the same way it is relaxed in connection with a @xmath15 generation group that is discussed in the next subsection , the rest of the couplings can be unified with a smaller @xmath25 and this channel is still viable . in the present case nonetheless ,",
    "the largeness of @xmath25 used would correspond to an unacceptably large weak scale .",
    "the fact that @xmath58 breaks far away from @xmath4 would also render effects coming from the mechanism to which its breaking is due and which are here neglected , like the existence of scalar particles , more important .",
    "such effects however are not expected to alleviate the problem of the large scale @xmath25 .",
    "we can therefore conclude here that the third breaking channel is improbable , unless generation - coupling unification with the rest of the couplings is abandoned .",
    "another way to keep @xmath25 small would be of course to add a large higgs sector transforming non - trivially under @xmath13 , but this alternative is not investigated since it is foreign to the present conceptual framework and would raise naturalness problems .",
    "gauge - coupling unification in connection with bounds on the proton life - time is discussed next , since the breaking of @xmath9 at @xmath4 can induce proton decay via effective four - fermion operators .",
    "this issue could actually help us decide between the first two breaking channels proposed . from the proton life - time experimental constraint @xcite @xmath96 and the theoretical order - of - magnitude estimate @xmath97 one",
    "gets the inequality @xmath98    this proton life - time bound makes clear that the second breaking channel possibility is disfavored due to a small unification scale .",
    "nevertheless , it can not be at this point definitely excluded due to the limited level of accuracy of the current rather qualitative analysis .",
    "note that this result is reminiscent of the result of @xcite in an analysis with the same breaking sequence in a left - right symmetric context but without mirror fermions .",
    "one is consequently left with the first alternative as the one corresponding to the most probable symmetry breaking sequence .",
    "+ [ fig : fig2 ]      strong dynamics can alter the results quoted above , since higher - order corrections to the various @xmath24-functions due to the strong @xmath13 interactions could become important if the quantity @xmath34 introduced before is not negligible .",
    "however , as also noted in @xcite , the fermion content of the theory implies that this effect , however large , would be uniform for all standard - model couplings , as is shown in figure 4 for an exaggerated effect corresponding to @xmath99 . from eq.[eq : loop ] , this would correspond to a highly - non - perturbative generation coupling @xmath100 ( this number is of course purely indicative , since the perturbative @xmath24-function has no meaning in this regime ) , something which has the same influence on each of the other relatively weak @xmath29 couplings as the introduction of 20 new fermion @xmath31-plets .",
    "such strong dynamics can shift the unification coupling @xmath68 to larger values , but can not shift the unification scale . in reality",
    "the coupling - evolution curves shown should be smooth , without angles , but @xmath34 is here taken to become suddenly important for illustration purposes , in a - perhaps overambitious - effort to simulate the relevant effect .",
    "there is no guarantee of course that the non - perturbative effects of @xmath13 can be limited even by such large @xmath34-values , but it is assumed that they are in order to maintain the conclusions presented in this work .",
    "the analysis of this alternative leads one to split the scale where the mirror fermions decouple @xmath25 , from the scale @xmath101 where the generation group becomes strong , and consider for instance the most probable breaking channel corresponding to fig .",
    "an effort is therefore made to  parametrize \" by means of the quantity @xmath34 our ignorance of the the strong dynamics , and the effects they have on the other couplings , in the energy region between the scales @xmath101 and @xmath25 .",
    "the unification and pati - salam scale remain the same as in fig . 1 , but the scale @xmath25 has to be raised to @xmath102 gev and one has further a new scale @xmath103 gev in order to achieve unification . the strong coupling tends to make the other couplings slightly larger at @xmath4 , i.e. one gets @xmath88 .",
    "if these effects are really large , difficulties with the reproduction of the weak scale could potentially arise due to the heaviness of the mirror fermions .",
    "+ [ fig : fig3 ]      the issue of the generation groups comes next .",
    "even if there is an abelian generation group @xmath104 surviving down to tev - scales along with @xmath13 , unification requires that its coupling is negligibly small at low energies , so its running is neglected and its evolution with energy not plotted .",
    "note however that if one wants the see - saw mechanism to work for the standard - model neutrinos , as will be seen in the next section , this symmetry would have to be broken at very large energy scales to allow for ultra - light neutrinos . in the first case considered for instance",
    ", one could think of a breaking channel involving @xmath104 , like @xmath105 , with the standard - model neutrinos being @xmath106-neutral .",
    "this does not change the previous results and conclusions , but it could alter the values of the abelian generation group charges in @xcite",
    ".    one could also give - up unification of the generation group couplings with the other couplings .",
    "this would mean either letting the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 free , or considering @xmath15 instead of @xmath13 unbroken down to low - energy scales .",
    "the latter would correspond to having also a fourth fermion generation paired - up with its mirror partner at scales of the order of 1 tev , which would make @xmath107 for the standard - model groups instead of @xmath51 used in all previous cases .",
    "the generation group @xmath24-function would remain with @xmath52 as before .",
    "the corresponding running of the couplings is plotted in figure 5 .",
    "the scales @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath4 remain the same as in the more favored case of fig",
    "this scenario has the advantage that it can generate lepton masses through a strong @xmath104 coupling after its breaking at around 1 tev @xcite .",
    "it suffers however from the same problem as the one encountered in @xcite , since in both cases the generation coupling is running too fast and complete unification is lost .",
    "unification could only be achieved by pushing the scale @xmath25 to very high values and thus paying the unacceptable price of a weak scale several orders of magnitude larger than what it should be .",
    "moreover , due to the introduction of additional low - lying fermions , it pushes the other gauge couplings to larger values at the unification point , since one finds @xmath108 , something which could potentially create problems with proton decay .",
    "this is also the reason why no additional fermion generations and their mirrors should be generally expected much below the unification scale .",
    "important conclusions can be therefore drawn here , namely that for unification of the generation coupling with the other gauge couplings one should have a group @xmath13 becoming strong at around 1 tev , whose coupling renormalization naturally reproduces the hierarchy between the qcd and the weak scale , and which argues against alternative generation groups unbroken to low energies like @xmath15 or @xmath109 for instance .",
    "this is to the best of our knowledge the first example of a fully unifiable and phenomenologically viable dynamical symmetry breaking model .",
    "note moreover that in all cases considered , the pati - salam group has to break at a very high energy to achieve unification , which is due to the fast running of the pati - salam coupling , making it very difficult to feed - down quark masses to leptons . in order to avoid light fundamental higgses therefore ,",
    "the existence of gauge - invariant operators of the form @xmath110 which arise non - perturbatively would have to be postulated to generate lepton masses .",
    "having acquired a general idea on how and at what energy scales the gauge symmetries break in this model , an investigation of the neutrino mass hierarchy and mixing angles is presented next . since the symmetry - breaking channels considered involve always the breaking of the @xmath58 and @xmath13 symmetries which protect neutrino and mirror neutrino majorana masses respectively , it is most natural to ask now what happens to their relevant masses and mixings after these breakings . in light of recent experimental results on neutrinos @xcite ,",
    "such considerations go beyond a mere academic interest .",
    "even though the analysis that follows is not exhaustive and the mass - matrix entries do not stem from a specific calculational scheme , this example not only demonstrates explicitly the power that the present framework has to describe several phenomenological issues without fine - tuning of parameters , but it also leads to quite useful general conclusions about the structure of the mirror - lepton submatrices . for simplicity , the lepton mass matrices , as well as their submatrices @xmath111 defined below , are taken symmetric and real , ignoring @xmath112 violating phases which may arise in the lepton sector .    recalling the numerical example in @xcite , for the charged leptons @xmath113 a @xmath114 mass matrix @xmath115",
    "is introduced , having the form @xmath116    with the superscripts @xmath117 indicating mirror fields and @xmath118 , @xmath119 being @xmath120 matrices in generation space given by @xmath121    these produce after diagonalization the following lepton and mirror - lepton mass hierarchy ( at 2 tev and in gev units ) :    standard - model charged leptons mirror charged leptons @xmath122 + @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "recall that the order of magnitude of these masses has to fulfill the double requirement of escaping direct detection in current high - energy facilities and reproducing along with the other mirror fermions the correct weak scale .    for the neutrinos",
    "the situation is more complicated , since they could be of a majorana nature .",
    "the neutrino @xmath129 mass matrix @xmath130 is introduced next , and it is taken to have the following form : @xmath131    where the entries shown are @xmath120 matrices in generation space .",
    "the zero blocks are protected by the @xmath42 symmetry .",
    "the matrices @xmath132 and @xmath133 denote dirac mass matrices having @xmath42-breaking and @xmath42-invariant entries respectively , and @xmath134 are majorana mass matrices with @xmath135-breaking elements for the mirror and ordinary neutrinos respectively . the structure of these matrices in generation space determines the mass hierarchies and mixings of the neutrinos .",
    "since the present model does not predict the existence of a light sterile neutrino , contrary to other ",
    "mirror \" models @xcite , attention is restricted to current experimental data regarding solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies which imply differences of masses - squared @xmath136 , with @xmath137 , and mixing angles @xmath138 between only three mass eigenstates @xmath139 of standard - model left - handed neutrinos , if one accepts the view that they are due to quantum - mechanically coherent oscillations between different neutrino - flavour eigenstates . assuming for instance that the small - angle msw solution to the solar - neutrino deficit involves the left - handed electron and muon standard - model neutrinos @xmath140 and @xmath141 , one gets experimental bounds which according to @xcite are given by @xmath142 with a mixing angle @xmath143 .    further information on neutrino masses and mixing coming from the atmospheric neutrino anomaly assuming it involves the left - handed standard - model neutrinos @xmath144 and @xmath141 , gives the bounds @xmath145 with a mixing angle @xmath146 associated with it @xcite .",
    "it has to be noted that this @xmath147 mixing is unusually large compared with charged fermion mixings observed so far .",
    "this experimental input constitutes the basis which determines the form of the neutrino submatrices given below .",
    "the working assumption is made next that the @xmath42-breaking mirror - fermion dirac masses satisfy the inequalities @xmath148 for each fermion generation , where @xmath149 stands for an up - type mirror quark field .",
    "this is done in analogy with the standard model , where each generation contains quarks which are heavier than the corresponding leptons .",
    "up - type quarks are heavier than the down - type quarks only for the two heavier standard - model generations , but it is imagined in the present example that this is a general property for mirror quarks and leptons in all their generations .    taking into consideration the charged - fermion mass matrices @xcite and the @xmath58-symmetry breaking scale ,",
    "the phenomenological input given above leads to the following choice of mass matrices : @xmath150    and @xmath151 with the @xmath132 entries being generated as in the matrix @xmath118 by the strong @xmath13 interaction which breaks @xmath152 dynamically @xcite , and @xmath153 the @xmath120 identity matrix .",
    "dirac mirror neutrinos are initially considered , since @xmath154 .",
    "it will become clear in the following that the magnitude of the @xmath133-entries , in conjunction with @xmath117 , seems to be crucial in order to reproduce the correct mixings of eqs .",
    "16 and 17 .",
    "once the magnitude of the @xmath117 entries is fixed , the structure of @xmath133 is therefore more or less constrained .    in the next section majorana mirror neutrinos",
    "are also studied , which leads to the introduction of a @xmath155 , but it is noted that the dirac or majorana nature of the mirror neutrinos does not influence substantially the masses and mixings of the ordinary neutrinos for which one has experimental evidence to compare with the relative theoretical predictions",
    ". therefore , dirac mirror neutrinos are suitable for the purposes of this section .",
    "the scale of the large majorana masses is taken to be close to the scale where the @xmath58 symmetry is broken .",
    "( gauge invariance dictates of course that this breaking is due to a non - zero vacuum expectation value of an @xmath58-triplet . )",
    "the matrix @xmath117 is chosen diagonal for simplicity , even though in principle the large @xmath147 mixing could originate also from this matrix .",
    "moreover , the mirror neutrino matrices @xmath156 are also chosen diagonal for simplicity , since mirror mixing can only indirectly be fed down to ordinary fermions and can hardly account for the large observed @xmath147 neutrino mixing . therefore , even if mirror - neutrino mixing is present , lack of relevant experimental evidence would just burden the numerical example with more parameters , so it is ignored .",
    "what is more , large non - diagonal elements in @xmath132 would lead to dangerously light weak - doublet mirror neutrinos .",
    "one is therefore left to try large non - diagonal elements for the matrix @xmath133 in order to explain at least part of the large neutrino mixing .",
    "the numerical example above leads after diagonalization of the mass matrix to the following neutrino mass hierarchy ( at 2 tev ):",
    "standard - model ( majorana ) neutrinos mirror ( dirac ) neutrinos ( gev)@xmath122 + @xmath157 ev , @xmath158 ev , @xmath159 ev @xmath160 , @xmath161 , + @xmath162 gev @xmath163 + the mass matrix @xmath130 gives also a mixing @xmath164 for the solar and atmospheric neutrino problems ( which in our case of course involve only standard - model neutrinos ) .",
    "equal to 0.04 and 0.53 respectively , which is compatible with experiment @xcite .",
    "whereas the form of @xmath132 is consistent with the corresponding mirror charged - lepton matrix @xmath118 , the matrix @xmath133 is slightly problematic , since it has a gauge - invariant mass term @xmath165 for the second generations which is larger than the corresponding @xmath166 quark - mass term in @xcite .",
    "qualitatively one would generally expect such terms involving quarks to be larger than the corresponding lepton ones .",
    "although this is generally expected in analogy with the standard - model case and based to possibly qcd - related contributions to particle masses , the lack of a definite calculational scheme for these gauge - invariant masses pose limits to such arguments .",
    "there are nevertheless several solutions to this naturalness issue , and these are presented below .",
    "one is to consider lighter mirror leptons , which would then allow for smaller entries in @xmath133 .",
    "this by itself would however not be enough to remove this discrepancy without exceeding the lower mass bounds on direct production of new weak - doublet fermions set by the lep experiments .",
    "another solution is to consider heavier mirror quarks and charged leptons , which would then require larger entries in the corresponding gauge - invariant quark - mass submatrices @xcite .",
    "this solution would also help indirectly to reduce the problems with the electroweak precision tests , as is shown in the next section .",
    "a third alternative solution to this naturalness question is here investigated , i.e. smaller majorana masses for the fields @xmath167 .",
    "this is not such a severe assumption , since in nature one has already examples like the electron which has a mass more than five orders of magnitude smaller than the scale where the symmetry which forbids its mass breaks .",
    "the choice @xmath168 gev is made next , and @xmath132 is kept the same as before , in which case the matrix @xmath133 takes the form @xmath169    as in the previous case , the closeness of the ( 2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) entries is crucial if one wants to generate large @xmath147 mixing without non - diagonal ( 2,3 ) and ( 3,2 ) entries which would be inconsistently large in comparison with the corresponding entries of the other fermion mass matrices .",
    "even though non - diagonal entries could also reproduce the correct neutrino mixing by being smaller than the ones chosen here , provided the diagonal entries were even closer to each - other , something which would be reminiscent of the maximally mixed @xmath170 system , such a scenario would fail to produce the required mass hierarchies . using the mass matrix in eq.[eq : matr ] gives rise to the following neutrino mass hierarchy ( at 2 tev",
    "):    standard - model ( majorana ) neutrinos mirror ( dirac ) neutrinos ( gev)@xmath122 + @xmath171 ev , @xmath158 ev , @xmath172 ev @xmath160 , @xmath161 , + @xmath173 gev @xmath163 . + and mixing angles similar to the ones in the previous case .",
    "even smaller majorana masses would potentially lead to neutrino masses on the order of 1 ev , which could be of cosmological interest because of hot dark matter .",
    "however , having majorana neutrino masses even lighter than two orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath58-breaking scale seems unlikely and such a possibility is not studied .",
    "a similar possibility would be to have a contribution on the order of 1 ev to the dirac sector of all standard - model neutrinos due to unspecified effects , but since the present model can not calculate or predict such effects this issue is also not pursued further .",
    "it is worth noting here that , in order to get the observed fermion mass hierarchies and mixings @xcite , one is lead to consider gauge - invariant fermion mass terms @xmath174 , denoted by @xmath175 for @xmath176 , exhibiting the hierarchy @xmath177    it therefore seems that the more gauge interactions a fermion flavour has , the larger the gauge - invariant - mass splitting between its third- and second - generation representatives , even when these gauge interactions are relatively weak compared to the @xmath13 one .",
    "this could be an indication of near - critical four - fermion interactions in the sense explained in @xcite and which are contained in the scenario presented in @xcite .",
    "the large neutrino mixing suggested by the superkamiokande data is therefore consistent with the existence of such type of interactions , as made clear by the generic pattern noted in eq .",
    "the symmetric charged- and neutral - lepton mass matrices used above are diagonalized by the @xmath178 and @xmath129 matrices which we denote by @xmath179 respectively , via the relations @xmath180 where the @xmath181 denote diagonal matrices .",
    "the lepton mixing information is therefore contained in a @xmath182 matrix @xmath183 defined by the relation @xmath184 where @xmath185-summation is implied , with @xmath186 , with @xmath187 running only over the @xmath42-doublet neutrino flavours , and @xmath188 . note that , following the convention of @xcite and contrary to the neutrino case , we keep flavour indices for the charged - lepton mass eigenstates due to the assumed small mixing between them .",
    "it is therefore clear that the three ordinary - neutrino and three mirror - neutrino flavor eigenstates @xmath189 which are weak doublets are given in terms of the twelve neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath190 via the relation @xmath191 , with @xmath192-summation implied .",
    "the first three neutrino mass eigenstates are light enough to allow their superposition to be considered as coherent .",
    "furthermore , since the matrix @xmath118 is almost diagonal , @xmath193 is close to the unit matrix and the form of @xmath183 is mostly affected by @xmath194 .",
    "experimentally one has presently information only on some of the elements of a @xmath120 submatrix of @xmath183 involving standard model left - handed neutrinos and denoted by @xmath195 , with @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "the above mass matrices allow the calculation of @xmath198 by means of eqs.[eq : mixing1 ] and [ eq : mixing2 ] , and this is found to be equal ( in absolute values ) to @xmath199    its form is quasi - symmetric as expected by the form of the mass matrices assumed .",
    "this is consistent with the matrix given in @xcite for the small - angle msw solution to the solar - neutrino deficit , even though in the present case @xmath198 is not rigorously unitary because of the existence of mirror leptons which slightly mix with the ordinary ones .",
    "moreover , it is observed that the smallness of the element @xmath200 justifies in the current example the assumption that the two oscillations are practically decoupled @xcite .",
    "larger non - diagonal entries in the matrix @xmath133 can further increase the entries ( 2,3 ) and ( 3,2 ) and the corresponding @xmath147 mixing . a similar analysis therefore",
    "could also be easily performed for the large mixing - angle msw and the vacuum - oscillation solutions for the solar - neutrino problem , without altering the conclusions drawn above about the possibility of having heavier mirror fermions than previously imagined for naturalness reasons , since these are based only on the heavier neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "the contributions of the mirror fermions to the electroweak precision parameters @xmath201 and @xmath202 were calculated in @xcite assuming dirac mirror neutrinos . since",
    "the generation symmetries which prohibit mirror majorana masses are broken at around 2 tev , it is natural to consider dirac - majorana mirror neutrinos next .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing a non - zero matrix @xmath203 with entries near that scale , for example @xmath204 gev .",
    "the standard - model masses and mixings do not change substantially with this introduction , while the dirac - majorana mirror neutrino mass hierarchy takes now the form ( in gev ) :    @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 + @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 .    by making the identification @xmath211 and @xmath212 for notational convenience for each of the three mirror - neutrino generations , in the limit @xmath213 the  oblique \" leptonic contribution to the @xmath201 parameter for each mirror generation having a charged lepton of mass @xmath214",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath215   \\ } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath216 this result is identical to the one given in @xcite in this mass - limit only if the quantities @xmath217 and @xmath218 are correctly defined as @xmath219    in the above , corrections due to the fact that one mirror neutrino is not much heavier than the @xmath220 boson are neglected , since the purpose of this example is to just illustrate an effect which depends only on mass ratios and not on independent masses , and since one has poor knowledge of the overall mirror fermion mass normalization anyway .",
    "note moreover that , contrary to @xcite-@xcite , the mirror neutrino masses @xmath221 do not correspond to pure weak eigenstates due to mixing with ordinary neutrinos .",
    "this mixing is however small due to the relative smallness of the elements of @xmath133 compared to the @xmath132 entries , and its effects are therefore also neglected .    as regards the @xmath222 parameter which measures the isospin breaking in the new sector , it is shown in @xcite that there exists no problem rendering it small enough to fit experiment , even though some fine tuning might be needed . since",
    "whatever leptonic contributions due to majorana mirror neutrinos as described in @xcite-@xcite can be compensated by a corresponding shift to the up - down mass splitting of the mirror fermions , there is no use of further discussing it in the present context when the precise mirror - fermion mass spectrum remains experimentally unknown .",
    "the total oblique correction @xmath223 to @xmath201 in this model assuming qcd - like dynamics is the sum of the contributions @xmath224 and @xmath225 coming from mirror quarks and leptons respectively , i.e. @xcite @xmath226 for the light mirror charged leptons chosen in the previous section , the change in @xmath225 due to the dirac - majorana nature of the mirror neutrinos is marginal , i.e. @xmath227 instead of @xmath228 for the case of dirac mirror neutrinos .",
    "if one chooses heavier charged mirror leptons , the change in @xmath225 is larger .",
    "for instance , for @xmath229 gev one gets @xmath230 , and for @xmath231 gev one gets @xmath232 .",
    "the fact that negative @xmath201 values are currently favored by experiment @xcite could therefore be an indication that the mirror leptons are heavier than the ones of about 200 gev chosen in @xcite .",
    "the lightest mirror neutrino can not be much lighter than what it is taken here because smaller values for its mass are excluded by present experiments .",
    "after analyzing the above formula for @xmath201 , it is concluded that contributions to @xmath233 are not very sensitive to @xmath234 , but depend drastically on @xmath235 .",
    "heavier mirror leptons would produce an even smaller @xmath201 parameter , but assuming that the mirror quarks are at least as heavy as them would render difficult the correct reproduction of the weak scale after a certain point .",
    "it is nevertheless clear that a larger @xmath235 hierarchy could facilitate the reproduction of a small or even negative @xmath201 parameter in accordance with experiment .",
    "this could be achieved now with the assistance of vertex corrections and non - qcd - like dynamics in these models as described in @xcite without having to introduce very large top - quark anomalous couplings .",
    "such a situation would also reduce the fine - tuning needed to keep the @xmath222 parameter small .",
    "mirror fermions near the weak scale offer rich possibilities for the study of new physics . however , the absence of direct experimental evidence on the existence of mirror partners to the standard - model fermions lead to the present qualitative study of various unification possibilities and related neutrino physics without a prior knowledge of the exact mirror mass hierarchies .",
    "this did not prevent however very useful general conclusions pertinent to such types of models to be drawn .",
    "there are two basic results to be kept in mind .",
    "one is that unification of all the gauge couplings , including the generation group coupling , is possible within this group - theoretical context and consistent not only with the weak scale but also with current bounds on the proton life - time .",
    "the other is that neutrino masses and mixings consistent with the observed solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies are naturally achieved .",
    "in particular , it is made clear that with the proposed fermion content extension , not only @xmath89 unification is disfavored , but also unification with an @xmath13 generation group is possible . within the group - theoretic framework chosen ,",
    "this is possible by taking the gauge coupling ( @xmath2 ) of one sector to be much larger than the other ( @xmath3 ) at the unification scale .",
    "this unification is _ a priori _ not at all obvious , and constitutes a highly non - trivial result within the context of dynamical symmetry breaking theories .",
    "there exist nevertheless no direct indications that the scales @xmath25 and @xmath26 assume indeed the exact values needed for this to happen , and no guarantee that this coupling crossing is not just a coincidence with no particular importance for the embedding of the standard - model gauge structure .",
    "moreover , the existence of  mirror fermions \" which are weak singlets is also not favored .",
    "this is a clear manifestation of the  @xmath236 \" problem in @xcite , @xcite which does not appear when weak - doublet mirrors of the type introduced in @xcite are used .",
    "even though these could _ a priori _ pose problems with the @xmath201 parameter , it was recently shown @xcite that vertex corrections could alleviate these effects .",
    "it is further shown that the most probable symmetry breaking channel is the @xmath237 .",
    "this breaking channel corresponds to a unification scale @xmath4 small enough to suggest that detection of proton decay could be soon experimentally accessible .",
    "present bounds on proton decay further indicate that no more fermion generations are very probable at low scales , since then , even though unification would still be possible , the unification coupling would be too large .",
    "furthermore , the different running of the @xmath67 and @xmath13 gauge couplings due to the different fermion numbers which correspond to them provide a natural and very interesting explanation of the hierarchy between the qcd scale and the weak scale , i.e. approximately the scale where the generation interactions @xmath13 become strong .",
    "the unification investigation conducted makes also apparent a problem in this theory having to do with the generation of lepton masses .",
    "in particular , the pati - salam scale @xmath26 is found to be too large to allow quark masses to be fed down to leptons via effective four - fermion operators associated to the @xmath27 breaking .",
    "if one does not want to use a fundamental higgs mechanism to break the generation group at the tev - scale , a solution to this problem would be a strong @xmath104 at the tev scale @xcite . to avoid a landau pole to the corresponding gauge coupling",
    ", the group @xmath104 has to be soon embedded into a larger non - abelian group , like @xmath15 .",
    "however , if one insists on unifying the generation coupling with the rest of the gauge couplings the solution above is unfortunately not viable , since as was noted in subsection 2.4 the @xmath15 coupling runs to fast to unify with the other gauge couplings .",
    "the group @xmath15 has therefore to be broken at the unification scale and the @xmath104 coupling at low energies is consequently very weak .",
    "a way out for lepton - mass generation could in principle be the existence of gauge - invariant operators generated beyond tree - level which feed down quark masses to leptons .",
    "as already stressed , in the unification analysis presented several effects are neglected .",
    "these are related to unification threshold effects , to the higgs content needed to break the @xmath27 and @xmath58 symmetries , to 2- and higher - loop contributions to the @xmath24 functions , to the fact that the mirror fermions are taken to be all degenerate in mass , and to the fact that @xmath13 becomes strongly coupled at around 1 tev , something that could influence the rest of the couplings .",
    "it is not expected however that these effects can spoil the qualitative results of the analysis above .",
    "unification could still be achieved if these effects were correctly taken into account , since one has the freedom to adjust the scales @xmath25 and @xmath26 without influencing considerably the unification scale @xmath4 .",
    "this is particularly true for the favored possibility presented in figure 1 , since the proximity of the scales @xmath26 and @xmath4 does not leave room for large adjustments .",
    "one could of course claim that the freedom to adjust @xmath26 in order to achieve unification makes this exercise easier to complete and reduces the predictability of the theory by adding an extra free parameter . on the other hand",
    ", the most favored scenario described connects this scale with the breaking not only of @xmath27 , but also of the @xmath58 symmetry .",
    "the examples involving majorana neutrinos which are presented above indicate however that this scale is expected to be several orders of magnitude smaller than the unification scale .",
    "this not only speaks against a  desert \" reaching up to @xmath4 , but is also consistent with the scenario analyzed here .    as already noted , the unification considerations above indicate a favored @xmath58 breaking scale usually associated with the mass of heavy majorana neutrinos in the context of the see - saw mechanism .",
    "this leads to the study of neutrino masses and mixings in this framework and in connection with recent experimental results .",
    "it is found that , in order to have the neutrino masses and mixings compatible with experiment and unification , heavier charged mirror fermions than the ones quoted in @xcite might be needed , unless the heavy standard - model majorana neutrinos are quite lighter than the scale where @xmath58 breaks .",
    "heavier mirror fermions imply furthermore not only a more difficult detection of their indirect effects , since their mixing with the standard - model fermions is smaller , but also smaller need of fine - tuning of their masses @xcite .",
    "it is further interesting to show that the above observation is perfectly consistent with a small @xmath201 parameter which is currently favored by electroweak precision tests .",
    "a small @xmath201-parameter could furthermore be an indication that the lightest mirror neutrino , i.e. the field denoted as @xmath238 , is so light that it could lie just beyond the reach of present high - energy collider experiments .",
