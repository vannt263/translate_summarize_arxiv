    "since early 1994 , when the borocarbide family ( , where r = rare earth ) was discovered@xcite a series of interesting results have been reported on these materials .",
    "the most remarkable feature is the coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism for r = tm , er , ho and dy . the high superconducting transition temperatures @xmath4 and the broad variation of the ratio @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the neel temperature , ranging from @xmath7 k to @xmath8 k )",
    "make this family particularly appropriate to explore that coexistence@xcite .",
    "interesting properties are also found in the non - magnetic borocarbides , r = y , lu .",
    "these materials exhibit a non - exponential temperature dependence@xcite and a non - linear field dependence@xcite of the electronic specific heat in the superconducting phase ; an anomalous upper critical field @xmath9 with an upward curvature near @xmath4@xcite and a four - fold oscillation when the field is rotated within the basal plane@xcite ; and a square flux line lattice ( fll ) at high fields@xcite .    although these properties were initially taken as evidence of a non conventional pairing mechanism@xcite , both the unconventional @xmath9 and the square fll",
    "can also be satisfactorily explained by assuming a non - local electrodynamics .",
    "traditionally , nonlocality was expected to be relevant only in materials with a ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath10 and sufficiently clean to have an electronic mean free path @xmath11 .",
    "however , the large vortex cores make theoretical analysis very difficult in that case .",
    "the borocarbides , in contrast , have intermediate @xmath12 values ( @xmath13 ) that make core effects much smaller .",
    "this allows the non - local effects to be introduced perturbatively either in the london model , as done by kogan , gurevich et al.@xcite , or in the ginzburg - landau theory , as shown by de wilde et al.@xcite and park and huse@xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the result is a coupling of the supercurrents to the underlying crystal symmetry .",
    "the first success of the kogan - gurevich nonlocal model was the explanation@xcite of the deviations of the reversible magnetization @xmath14 of bi:2212 in the mixed state from the logarithmic dependence on magnetic field , @xmath15 , predicted by the london model@xcite .",
    "later on , song et al.@xcite found similar deviations in yni@xmath0b@xmath0c when @xmath16-axis , that could also be quantitatively accounted for by the model .",
    "recently we have extended that study to all directions of @xmath17 and showed that this generalization of the london theory provides a satisfactory complete description of the anisotropic @xmath18 with a self - consistent set of parameters@xcite .    in the local london model anisotropy",
    "is introduced via a second rank mass tensor @xmath19 . in tetragonal materials such as borocarbides @xmath20 ,",
    "thus the properties should be isotropic in the basal plane",
    ". however , non - local corrections introduce@xcite a fourfold anisotropy as a function of the magnetic field orientation within the @xmath21 plane , reflecting the square symmetry .",
    "this @xmath22 periodicity was indeed observed in @xmath14 in the mixed state of both yni@xmath0b@xmath0c@xcite and luni@xmath0b@xmath0c@xcite .",
    "kogan s model also predicted@xcite that two structural transitions in the fll should occur in borocarbides for @xmath16 , a first order reorientation transition between two rhombic lattices at a field @xmath23 and a second order transition from rhombic to square at @xmath24",
    ". small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) studies@xcite confirmed those predictions in yni@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "a jump in the apical angle @xmath25 of the rhombic lattice , discontinuous within the resolution , occurs at @xmath26 to @xmath27 , and the lattice becomes square ( @xmath28 ) at @xmath29 to @xmath30 . according to a recent analysis by knigavko et al.@xcite ,",
    "@xmath23 really consists of two second order transitions taking place in a very narrow field range .",
    "although the role of nonlocality on the @xmath31 properties of the fll is by now convincingly established , less is known about its effects on the @xmath32 vortex response . since nonmagnetic borocarbides exhibit a very low critical current @xmath33 for @xmath16 , pinning correlation volumes were expected to be large , as indeed observed@xcite .",
    "thus , the elastic properties of the fll must play a key role in the pinning . as the shear modulus @xmath34 depends on @xmath25@xcite , and @xmath25",
    "undergoes a discontinuous jump at @xmath23 , it is bound to happen that @xmath34 and therefore the pinning properties change abruptly at this field@xcite . in other words , vortex pinning , which involves distortions from equilibrium vortex configurations ,",
    "should be affected by the symmetry changes in the vortex lattice .",
    "recently we showed@xcite that , in yni@xmath0b@xmath0c and for @xmath35 , the reorientation transition at @xmath23 induces a kink in the pinning force density @xmath36 .",
    "we also observed anisotropies in @xmath1 both between the c - axis and the basal plane ( out - of - plane anisotropy ) and within the plane ( in - plane anisotropy ) .",
    "we found that @xmath1 for @xmath2 is one order of magnitude larger than for @xmath35 and has a quite different field dependence .",
    "we argued that this surprising behavior is unlikely to arise either from pinning by magnetic impurities or from non - local effects , although we recognized that the evidence supporting those claims was not conclusive .",
    "here we report further studies of @xmath1 in non - magnetic borocarbides .",
    "we show that the kink in @xmath36 is also visible in luni@xmath0b@xmath0c and coincides with the field @xmath23 for this compound , thus confirming that it is a signature of this nonlocality - induced transition .",
    "we find that @xmath37 slightly decreases as @xmath38 increases , in contrast to @xmath39 .",
    "we also study the effect of co - doping in lu(ni@xmath40co@xmath41)@xmath0b@xmath0c .",
    "we observe that @xmath23 decreases as the nonlocal effects are progressively suppressed by increasing @xmath42 , in agreement with the @xmath38 dependence .",
    "all the luni@xmath43co@xmath41b@xmath0c samples exhibit an enormous out - of - plane anisotropy .",
    "this unambiguously demonstrates that this anisotropy is due neither to the magnetic impurities ( as those crystals have a density of impurities much smaller than the yni@xmath0b@xmath0c crystal ) , nor to nonlocality ( as it does not dissapear with increasing @xmath42 ) .",
    "we also rule out the precence of surface barriers for @xmath44 by performing minor hysterisis loops .",
    "we report magnetization measurements , performed with a quantum design squid magnetometer , on yni@xmath0b@xmath0c ( y-0 ) , and lu(ni@xmath40co@xmath41)@xmath0b@xmath0c with @xmath45 ( lu-0 ) , @xmath46 ( lu-1.5 ) and @xmath47 ( lu-3 ) single crystals .",
    "the dimensions , @xmath4 and estimated @xmath48 for each sample are summarized in table i. the y-0 crystal is the same one that was previously investigated in refs.@xcite .",
    "the normal state magnetization follows a curie law that indicates the presence of a very dilute distribution of localized magnetic moments .",
    "it corresponds to a rare - earth impurity content of @xmath49 at .",
    "@xmath50 relative to y , probably due to contaminants in the y starting material@xcite .",
    "the lu(ni@xmath40co@xmath41)@xmath0b@xmath0c crystals , grown as described elsewhere@xcite , show a much weaker curie tail at low temperatures ( @xmath51 ) which might arise , for example , from a @xmath52 magnetic impurities of gd in the lu site@xcite .",
    "isothermal magnetization loops in the superconducting mixed state were measured , and the critical current density @xmath33 was then calculated using the bean s critical state model@xcite .",
    "figure [ fpvsh](a ) shows the pinning force density @xmath53 for the sample as a function of the applied field for @xmath54-axis at several @xmath38 .",
    "we observe that at low fields @xmath36 decreases strongly with increasing @xmath3 , but above a field @xmath55 the field dependence becomes much weaker . in a recent work@xcite we showed that this `` kink '' in @xmath36 at @xmath56 is a signature of the reorientation phase transition in the fll .",
    "we based this claim in several facts .",
    "first , the position of the kink for @xmath54 coincides with the value of @xmath23 .",
    "second , @xmath56 is rather insensitive to the field orientation , in agreement with the behavior of @xmath23 observed in sans experiments@xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath57 is an increasing function of @xmath38 , as predicted by knigavko et al.@xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,>,>,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now expand the previous study and analyze the behavior of the field @xmath56 when the nonlocality is reduced . in the kogan - gurevich description@xcite the strength of the nonlocal perturbations is parametrized by a new characteristic distance , the nonlocality radius @xmath58 : the weaker the nonlocality effects , the smaller @xmath58 .",
    "this means that @xmath58 decreases with increasing @xmath38 or decreasing @xmath48 .",
    "thus , if this model is correct , an increase in @xmath38 or a decrease in @xmath48 should produce qualitatively similar effects on the nonlocality - induced transitions @xmath23 and @xmath59 .",
    "-axis for ( a ) y-0 sample at several temperatures and ( b ) lu-0 , lu-1.5 and lu-3 samples at @xmath60.,width=340 ]    a typical way to reduce @xmath48 is to introduce impurities .",
    "it has been shown that the increase of @xmath42 in lu(ni@xmath40co@xmath41)@xmath0b@xmath0c crystals decreases @xmath48 without significantly increasing @xmath33@xcite .",
    "recent results confirmed that the analogy between @xmath38 and @xmath48 is indeed valid in this material in the case of @xmath59 .",
    "first , gammel et al.@xcite showed that @xmath59 increases as @xmath48 is reduced by increasing @xmath42 .",
    "later on , eskildsen et al.@xcite showed that @xmath39 also rises as @xmath38 increases .    if @xmath56 is indeed a signature of @xmath23 , we should also find a correlation between its @xmath38 and @xmath48 dependencies . in figure [ phasediagram ]",
    "we plot @xmath61 , together with @xmath62 .",
    "we observe that @xmath56 is almost constant at low @xmath38 and , unlike the rhombic to square second order transition @xmath39 , it slightly decreases with @xmath38 at higher temperatures .",
    ".,width=340 ]    to determine the @xmath48 dependence of @xmath56 we performed measurements on the lu-0 , lu-1.5 and lu-3 samples at @xmath63 for @xmath54 ( estimates of @xmath48 are given in table i ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fpvsh](b ) , where we plotted @xmath36 .",
    "we observe that the kink in @xmath1 ( indicated by the arrows ) is still visible in the field range where the transition @xmath23 should appear , and that it shifts to lower fields with increasing @xmath42 , in agreement with the @xmath38 dependence .",
    "in other words , the analogy between @xmath42 and @xmath38 is satisfied for @xmath56 , thus confirming that the kink arises from nonlocality .    another",
    "interesting fact is that the lu-0 sample has a larger @xmath1 than the y-0 sample at the same @xmath38 , even though it has a lower density of magnetic impurities .",
    "this indicates that the magnetic moments in the y-0 are not the relevant pins for the flux lines when @xmath35 .",
    "we now turn to the pinning properties for @xmath2 .",

    "second , @xmath1 is much larger than for @xmath16 over most of the field range .",

    "the @xmath71 values are similar .",

    "( c ) lu-1.5 at @xmath63 for @xmath35 and @xmath44 .",
    "( b ) and ( d ) show the out of plane anisotropy @xmath71 corresponding to ( a ) and ( c ) respectively.,width=453 ]    hereafter we will focus on the origin of the difference in @xmath1 between the @xmath75-axis and the @xmath21-plane . as we pointed out in ref.@xcite , the large out - of - plane",
    "@xmath1 anisotropy sharply contrasts with the very small ( @xmath76 ) mass anisotropy@xcite .",
    "therefore , explanations based on the anisotropic scaling frequently used in high @xmath4 superconductors@xcite are ruled out .",
    "as we mentioned above , the y-0 crystal contains a small amount of magnetic impurities@xcite , which align preferentially along the ab - plane and thus are a potential source of the @xmath1 anisotropy .",
    "however , we had previously argued@xcite that this was unlikely .",
    "indeed , since the alignment of these localized moments increases with @xmath3 , pinning should become more directional as the field increases and thus @xmath71 should increase monotonically with @xmath3 . this is not in agreement with the data in fig.[outofplane](b ) , where @xmath71 first grows with @xmath77 , maximizes at @xmath78 and decreases again .",
    "in particular , @xmath1 is almost isotropic at the peak effect ( see dotted line which corresponds to @xmath79 ) .",
    "thus , although we were not able to totally rule out magnetic pinning on crystal y-0 , the data suggested that this was not the case .",
    "conclusive evidence that the localized magnetic moments are not responsible for the large @xmath71 comes from the persistence of this effect in the samples lu-0 , lu-1.5 and lu-3 , which have a magnetic impurity content two order of magnitude lower than the y-0 crystal . in figure",
    "[ outofplane](c ) we show @xmath80 for the lu-1.5 for @xmath16 and @xmath2 , at @xmath63 , and in figure .",
    "[ outofplane](d ) we plotted the corresponding @xmath81 .",
    "we observe that the out - of - plane anisotropy is even larger than in the y-0 sample .",
    "in contrast to the behavior observed in the y-0 , @xmath71 in the lu-1.5 increases monotonically with @xmath77 up to near the peak effect region , where it suddenly drops approaching to the isotropic limit .",
    "measurements on the lu-3 crystal at several @xmath38 show a similar behavior and exhibit a @xmath71 larger than in the y-0 .",
    "we had also previously argued@xcite that @xmath71 in the y-0 sample seems too large to be ascribed to nonlocality , which should appear as a perturbatively small effect .",
    "this conclusion is unambiguously confirmed by the presence of even larger @xmath71 values in the doped samples lu-1.5 and lu-3 , where nonlocal effects are strongly suppressed .",
    "the existence of significant surface barriers for @xmath2 , have also been ruled out by performing minor hysteresis loops with @xmath82 at several @xmath38 and @xmath3 .",
    "examples for the y-0 and lu-1.5 samples are shown in figure  [ minorloops ] .",
    "if hysteresis were due to surface barriers no flux changes would occur in the bulk while @xmath3 is changing from one branch of the main loop to the other one , hence the data of the minor loop connecting the lower and upper branches would be meissner - like straight lines@xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the case of bulk pinning , the lines connecting both branches are curved ( parabolic in the simplest bean model for an infinite slab ) just as we observe in the insets of figure [ minorloops](a ) and ( b ) .     at @xmath63 for ( a ) y-0 sample and ( b ) lu-1.5 sample . the insets show a blow up of the minor hysterisis loops corresponding to the full loop showed in the main panel .",
    "the dotted lines show the behavior expected for surface barriers.,width=340 ]    moreover , the @xmath1 calculated from these minor loops assuming only bulk pinning are in good agreement with those obtained from the main loops ( fig .",
    "[ outofplane ] ) . indeed , according to the isotropic bean model",
    "the critical state profile can be completely inverted if we change the external field in @xmath83 , where @xmath84 , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the shortest and largest sample dimensions perpendicular to the field direction , respectively . from the inset of figure  [ minorloops](a ) we find that the width of the hysterisis loop is @xmath87 .",
    "for this sample @xmath88 , thus it is expected that the connecting line between the two branches of the loop , reaches the upper branch , when the field is decreased about @xmath89 .",
    "inspection of figure  [ minorloops](a ) shows that @xmath90 , in reasonably good agreement given the simplicity of the model .",
    "the same analysis on the data of the inset of figure  [ minorloops](b ) , leds to a similar conclusion .",
    "non - magnetic borocarbides provide a very attractive ground to study the limit of very low pinning forces .",
    "the high quality of the crystals have the double benefit of producing large mean free paths , resulting in measurable non - local effects , and a very dilute distribution of vortex pinning centers .",
    "the combination of both factors allows the observation of the influence of nonlocality on vortex pinning .",
    "this is a rather unexplored field , and further studies , both experimental and theoretical , are needed . on the other hand ,",
    "the origin of the large out - of - plane anisotropy in @xmath1 is unclear and deserves further investigation .",
    "we have conclusively ruled out explanations based on the mass anisotropy , pinning by magnetic impurities , non - local effects and surface barriers . a simple explanation for it could be the presence of some still unidentified anisotropic pinning centers , such as planar defects .",
