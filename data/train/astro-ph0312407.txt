    "3c120 ( z=0.033 ; @xcite ) , also known as ii zw 14 and pks 0430 + 052 , is usually classified as a seyfert 1 galaxy , although its morphology in the optical band is not as simple as that of a typical galaxy of this class .",
    "indeed , photometric and spectroscopic studies seem to indicate that 3c120 either passed , or it is still passing through a merger process ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the residual i - band image obtained by @xcite after subtraction of the stellar contribution , showed a complex structure formed by several condensations , probably associated to active star forming regions @xcite , and an elongated structure which coincides with the kilo - parsec radio jet detected at 5 ghz @xcite .",
    "in fact , this large scale jet is the extension of a sub - parsec scale jet , which remains relativistic up to distances of about 100 kpc .",
    "@xcite .",
    "several superluminal radio components have been detected in the jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with different velocities and position angles , besides a stationary core smaller than 54 @xmath0as ( 0.025@xmath1 pc ) @xcite .",
    "there is also evidence of the existence of trailing shocks in the jet @xcite , that is , features that do not originate in the jet inlet .",
    "these features could be related to pinch - mode jet - body instabilities produced by the propagation of the superluminal components , as shown recently by numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the observed correlation between dips in the x - ray emission and ejection of superluminal components has been interpreted as a consequence of the connection between jet origin and the accretion disc , such as in the case of microquasars @xcite .",
    "3c120 presents variability in all bands and in different time - scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the complex variability found in the historical _ b_-band light curve was decomposed by @xcite in three different components : a linear time decrease of its magnitude due to the diminution of the accretion rate , a long - term variability with a period of 12.4-yr produced by thermal or viscous instabilities in the accretion disc , and short - term variations associated to magnetic eruptions in the magnetized disc .    in this paper ,",
    "the reported 12.4-yr variability is interpreted as periodic boosting of the radiation emitted by the underlying jet , caused by jet precession .",
    "this model also explains the differences in superluminal velocities and position angles of the different components , assuming that they represent the direction of the jet inlet at the epoch in which the components were formed .",
    "furthermore , the complex jet structure of 3c120 at large scales is also studied in the framework of jet precession .",
    "jet precession has been claimed by several authors in order to explain the radio structure of several quasars , bl lacs and radio - galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , suggesting that jet precession is not so uncommon phenomenon in the universe .",
    "we shall adopt @xmath2 and @xmath3 throughout the paper .",
    "high - resolution observations between 5 and 43 ghz @xcite give the core - component distance @xmath4 and the position angle on the plane of sky @xmath5 for each feature in the sub - parsec scale jet . using data at different epochs ,",
    "the apparent proper motion @xmath0 is calculated and the apparent velocity @xmath6 in units of light speed @xmath7 is obtained from :       + where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the hubble constant in units of km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 is the deceleration parameter and @xmath13 is the redshift .",
    "the ejection epoch @xmath14 of each component is obtained by back - extrapolation of their linear motions .",
    "the kinematic parameters of the different superluminal features are presented in table 1 ."

    "<S> the differences in the apparent velocities of the different superluminal components in the milliarcsecond jet can also be explained by the precession model as being related to changes in the viewing angle . </S>",

    "<S> , we consider that 3c120 harbours a super - massive black hole binary system in its nuclear region and that torques induced by misalignment between the accretion disc and the orbital plane of the secondary black hole are responsible for this precession ; we estimated upper and lower limits for the black holes masses and their mean separation .    </S>",
