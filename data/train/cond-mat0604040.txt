    "intermediate or strong electron - phonon ( ep ) interaction gives rise to the existence of polaronic carriers in a number of interesting materials ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . as a consequence , models for such quasiparticles , e.g.",
    ", the holstein model @xcite considered here , have been investigated intensively in the past decades in order to understand the process of polaron formation . whereas valuable insight into the latter may be gained by considering a single charge carrier ( i.e. , the holstein polaron problem ) , real materials are usually characterized by finite carrier densities , motivating studies of many - polaron models @xcite .    over the last decade ,",
    "a large number of theoretical studies , the most reliable of which based on unbiased numerical methods , have led to a fairly complete understanding of the holstein polaron concerning both ground - state and spectral properties .",
    "calculations of the latter , e.g. , the one - electron green function , are particularly rewarding as they provide detailed insight into the non - linear process of an electron becoming self - trapped in the surrounding lattice distortion . for reviews of the holstein polaron problem",
    "see @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we contribute to a completion of the knowledge about the single - polaron problem by investigating the phonon spectral function , an important observable rarely considered in previous work . on the contrary",
    ", it has been studied quite intensively for the spinless holstein model and the holstein - hubbard model , both at half filling , for which phonon softening at the zone boundary has been found to occur at the peierls transition in one dimension @xcite . note that the assumption of a local self - energy frequently used in combination with dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)as appropriate for infinite dimensions  leads to an unrealistic wavevector - independent softening of all phonon excitations @xcite .",
    "the renormalization of the phonon modes in small clusters with one electron , especially their softening at the critical ep coupling , has been investigated numerically in @xcite , and results for the coherent phonon spectrum of the infinite system have been reported in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , analytical approximations for the phonon self - energy and the frequencies of the vibration modes in the coupled ep system have been obtained in @xcite .    here",
    "we present analytical calculations valid at weak and strong ep coupling , respectively , as well as a cluster approach , similar to cluster perturbation theory @xcite , which yields accurate results in all relevant parameter regimes .",
    "both approaches are capable of describing the momentum dependence of the phonon spectral functions , and we find a very good agreement between analytical and numerical results .    despite the formal restriction to the one - electron case , the numerical results will correspond to finite electron densities due to the finite underlying clusters . the analytical calculations presented here",
    "are based on the electron ( polaron ) spectral functions previously deduced in @xcite for the weak - coupling ( wc ) and strong - coupling ( sc ) cases and for charge carrier concentrations @xmath0 .",
    "these spectral functions depend on @xmath1 and their calculation requires a self - consistent determination of the chemical potential @xmath2 . to avoid this difficult task",
    ", we shall consider the analytical formulas in the mathematical limit of @xmath2 approaching the bottom of the electron ( polaron ) band .",
    "the resulting limiting shape of the spectral functions will provide us with a picture of the phonon spectrum for small carrier concentrations .",
    "in particular , as demonstrated below , the positions of the low - energy excitations will be found to be in a very good agreement with numerical results .",
    "moreover , the general analytical treatment will enable us to discuss to some extent the features which occur for non - negligible carrier concentrations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , we introduce the holstein model . section  [ sec : methods ] is devoted to the derivation of the analytical results and a discussion of our cluster approach , whereas section  [ sec : results ] contains the results and a discussion .",
    "finally , we summarize in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in view of the sc approximation presented below , it is convenient to write the hamiltonian of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) spinless holstein model as @xmath3 where @xmath4 in equation  ( [ eq : h ] ) , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) creates a spinless fermion ( a phonon of energy @xmath7 ) at site @xmath8 , and @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "the first term contains the chemical potential @xmath2 and determines the carrier density @xmath1 , whereas the second term accounts for the elastic and kinetic energy of the lattice .",
    "finally , the last term describes the local coupling between the lattice displacement @xmath11 and the electron density @xmath12 with the coupling parameter @xmath13 ( for @xmath14 , cf equation  ( [ eq : coeffs ] ) ) , as well as electron hopping processes between neighbouring lattice sites @xmath15 with hopping amplitude @xmath16 ( for @xmath17 ) .",
    "we take @xmath16 as the unit of energy , and set the lattice constant to unity .    from numerous previous investigations @xcite of this model in the one - electron case considered here",
    "the following picture emerges . at wc ,",
    "the ground state consists of a large polaron , corresponding to a self - trapped electron with a lattice distortion extending over many lattice sites . as the ep coupling",
    "is increased , a cross - over takes place to a small - polaron state , in which the lattice distortion is essentially localized at the site of the electron , leading to a substantial increase of the quasiparticle s effective mass in the intermediate - coupling ( ic ) and sc regime . depending on the value of the adiabaticity ratio @xmath18",
    ", the small - polaron cross - over occurs at a critical value of the ep coupling determined by the more restrictive of the two conditions @xmath19 ( relevant for @xmath20 ) or @xmath21 ( for @xmath22 ) . here",

    "the aim of the present treatment is to deduce and to interpret the essential features of the numerically calculated phonon spectral functions ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) . in the following calculations",
    ", we shall deal with coupled equations of motion of the matsubara green functions for the lattice - oscillator coordinates on the one hand , and for the spinless charge carriers on the other hand .",
    "it will be shown that the general features of the spectral functions may be understood on the basis of the results obtained for the wc and sc cases , where an approximate treatment is well justified @xcite .      the matsubara green function for phonons , defined as @xmath25 fulfills the equation of motion @xmath26 assuming @xmath27 in the wc regime .",
    "the mixed green function on the rhs of equation  ( [ eq : eom ] ) will be expressed by means of the generalized fermionic green function @xcite @xmath28 and @xmath29 where the classical variables @xmath30 were introduced as a purely formal device .",

    "however , @xmath58 as derived in @xcite depends on the charge - carrier concentration @xmath1 and has to be determined self - consistently with a condition for the chemical potential @xmath2 .",
    "the situation is thus simplified if we restrict ourselves to the case of small carrier concentration , for which the dependence on @xmath1 is expected to be unimportant . to choose the dominant contributions to the integral on the rhs of equation  ( [ eq : pi3 ] ) for small @xmath1 ,",
    "the integration over @xmath61 and @xmath62 will be divided according to the character of the electronic spectral functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the coherent part of the spectrum @xmath65 , non - zero for @xmath66 , consists of quasiparticle peaks , @xmath67 whereas outside this frequency interval the incoherent spectral function @xmath68 is formed by peaks of finite width . in the sequel",
    ", the integrals obtained in this way will be examined with respect to the behaviour in the limit of small concentrations , i.e. , for @xmath2 lying near @xmath69 , the bottom of the band defined by equation  ( [ eq : coh ] ) .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath70 are obtained if the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath71-function are substituted into equation  ( [ eq : pi3 ] ) .",
    "the behaviour of the resulting integrals for @xmath2 in the neighbourhood of @xmath69 is then analyzed in the mathematical limit @xmath72 .",
    "we find that the integration for @xmath73 according to equation  ( [ eq : pi3 ] ) gives zero in the limit of vanishing carrier concentration .",
    "in contrast , the integration for @xmath74 yields a non - zero result in this limit , with the coherent parts of the spectra , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , being the only non - vanishing contributions .",

    "we explicitly take the limit @xmath91 .",
    "thereby , @xmath92 and the rhs of equation  ( [ eq : im_pi ] ) is non - zero only on the curve @xmath93 provided that @xmath94 .",
    "the values of @xmath74 are given as follows : @xmath95 where the function @xmath96 is the generalization of the kronecker symbol being equal to unity for @xmath97 and zero otherwise .",
    "consequently , in this limit , the narrow peaks of finite frequency width following for @xmath74 from equation  ( [ eq : im_pi ] ) , are replaced by discrete lines given by equation  ( [ eq : im_pi ] ) .",
    "the divergence of the imaginary part of the phonon self - energy at @xmath98 and @xmath99 is connected with the 1d electron band dispersion .",
    "our method of calculation only takes into account contributions to the electronic spectral function up to second order , which is insufficient if divergences occur .    on physical grounds ,",
    "one expects no renormalization of the phonon excitations in the zero - density limit , i.e. , for one electron in an infinite lattice . the non - zero imaginary part of the phonon self - energy even for @xmath100 [ equation  ( [ eq : im_pi ] ) ] does not contradict this expectation since the integrated weight of the corresponding features is zero .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : results ] , these non - zero contributions to the limit of the phonon spectrum may be related to results for small but finite carrier densities .",
    "so far , we have restricted ourselves to @xmath101 , but the case @xmath102 may be treated quite analogously .",

    "the equation of motion  ( [ eq : eom ] ) does not hold exactly in the sc regime , as the coordinate @xmath118 of the local oscillator at site @xmath119 implies a shift due to the local lattice deformation associated with on - site small - polaron formation .",
    "in fact , @xmath120 , which follows from the lang - firsov canonical displacement transformation @xcite . however , dealing with the limit of negligible charge - carrier concentration , @xmath121 may again be assumed . on the other hand ,",
    "the charge - carrier number operator in the electron picture is equal to the number operator in the small - polaron picture . therefore , we interpret the fermi operators @xmath122 , @xmath123 in equation  ( [ eq : eom ] ) as annihilation and creation operators of small polarons  the correct quasiparticles in the sc limit .",
    "accordingly , the mixed term on the rhs of equation  ( [ eq : eom ] ) will be expressed using the generalized small - polaron green functions , defined again by equations  ( [ eq : def : g ] ) ,  ( [ eq : def : s ] ) , where the operators @xmath124 as before , but the @xmath125 correspond to the nearest - neighbour hopping term in the sc regime , i.e. , @xmath126 the formalism of generalized green functions of small polarons was introduced by schnakenberg @xcite and applied to self - energy calculations in @xcite .",
    "apart from the @xmath125 given by equation  ( [ eq : sc : c ] ) , in contrast to previous work we also include @xmath127 in our definition of the generalized green function .",
    "the presence of the coefficients @xmath128 in the time - ordered exponential in equation  ( [ eq : def : s ] ) causes the polaronic operators not to commute with the exponent due to the oscillator shift proportional to @xmath129 .",

    "is dominated by the coherent part representing the polaron band of width @xmath134 , showing that small polarons are the correct quasiparticles and that multi - phonon processes in the self - energy are negligible .",

    "note that the analytical results of section  [ sec : analytical ] fulfil the usual sum rule for the phonon spectral function @xcite for @xmath160 .",
    "to proceed , as a first step , we divide the infinite lattice into identical clusters of @xmath161 sites each , and calculate the cluster green function @xmath162 of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h ] ) with one electron and @xmath163 for all non - equivalent pairs of sites @xmath164 . for this purpose",

    "as expected , for these parameters , the sc approximation fits well the numerical results .",
    "another general feature related to the @xmath7-dependence of the spectral function becomes apparent if we compare the heights of peaks in figures  [ fig : polaron_w0.4 ] and  [ fig : polaron_w4.0 ] ( the ordinate scale in figure  [ fig : polaron_w0.4 ] is about a factor of five larger than that in figure  [ fig : polaron_w4.0 ] ) .",
    "this dependence reflects the fact that the transition probability at low temperatures is proportional to the density of polaron states in the coherent band . the latter quantity increases with decreasing bandwidth , and the pronounced difference between adiabatic and anti - adiabatic spectral functions in the sc limit is evident from equation  ( [ eq : bqw_sc ] ) , where the height of the peaks is dominated by the factor @xmath189 .",
    "we conclude that the wc approximation based on the second - order electron spectral function , and the hartree approximation for the sc small - polaron limit are able to grasp the main qualitative features of the phonon spectral function across the range of model parameters .",
    "however , as discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] , the numerical calculations do not represent exactly the limit of negligible charge - carrier concentration , owing to the restricted cluster volume .",
    "a direct comparison with results obtained by carrying out the limiting procedure for the analytical formulas in section  [ sec : analytical ] would be possible only for @xmath190 .",
    "on the other hand , no restrictions concerning the charge carrier concentration were imposed in deducing equation  ( [ eq : pi3 ] ) in section  [ sec : methods : wc ] and equation  ( [ eq : d_sc ] ) in section  [ sec : methods : sc ] .",
    "consequently , the analysis of the latter equations outlined in section  [ sec : analytical ] permits us to discuss the additional features of spectra for non - negligible carrier concentrations revealed by the numerical results .",
    "first , the discussion in section  [ sec : methods : wc ] strongly suggests that the low - energy peaks of finite width correspond to the solutions of equations  ( [ eq : im_pi])([eq : om ] ) at fixed wavevector @xmath89 if @xmath2 lies above the bottom of the electron ( polaron ) band .",
    "second , at finite concentrations , the contributions of the incoherent part @xmath191 of the electron ( polaron ) spectral function to @xmath74 are not negligible and , in this way , additional maxima above @xmath143 occurring in the numerical results may be understood as originating from phonon - assisted processes implied in @xmath191 .",
    "finally , the non - zero @xmath73 in general causes a shift of the bare phonon line away from @xmath143 but , according to numerical results , the latter is not very pronounced in the wc and sc cases .",
    "we have presented results for the phonon spectral function of the holstein polaron in all relevant parameter regimes obtained by a reliable and systematic cluster approach similar to cluster perturbation theory .",
    "the characteristic features of the spectra have been discussed and successfully related to analytical self - energy calculations valid at weak and strong coupling , respectively . as far as a direct comparison",
    "is possible , our findings are in agreement with previous work on the phonon dynamics .",
    "in particular , we have pointed out the important differences between weak , intermediate and strong coupling , on the one hand , and between the adiabatic and the anti - adiabatic regime , on the other hand . as revealed by the analytical results ,",
    "the phonon spectra of the holstein polaron are dominated by the bare , unrenormalized phonon line and the renormalized polaron band dispersion . at intermediate coupling ,",
    "additional features such as level repulsion and mirror images of the polaron band have been observed .",
    "together with previous studies of the electron spectral function and the renormalization of phonon energies , this work provides a fairly complete picture of the spectral properties of the one - dimensional holstein polaron , which has been in the focus of intensive investigations over several decades due to the wide - spread relevance of polaron physics .",
