    "recently , based on the mass matrix motivated by ref.@xcite , ref.@xcite has investigated the implications of the new data presented by the wa102 collaboration@xcite for the glueball - quarkonia content of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively stand for @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 below ) .",
    "we propose that some points can be improved on .",
    "first , in the reduced partial width @xmath8 in ref.@xcite , the sign of the contribution of the diagram iv ) of fig .",
    "1 was flipped , it should be negative .",
    "the flipped sign actually arose from a typo in the equation ( a5 ) of ref.@xcite where the @xmath9 should all read @xmath10 .",
    "second , the mixing angle of @xmath0 and @xmath1 was determined to be a very small value of @xmath11@xcite which is inconsistent with the value of @xmath12 determined from a rather exhaustive and up - to - date analysis of data including strong decays of tensor and higher spin mesons , electromagnetic decays of vector and pseudoscalar mesons , and the decays of @xmath13@xcite .",
    "also , the possibility that the glueball components exist in @xmath0 and @xmath1 was not considered in ref.@xcite .",
    "refs.@xcite already suggested that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 wave functions need glueball components .    in this work , instead of the mass matrix in which one should confront with the confused mass level order about the masses of the bare states @xmath14 , @xmath15 and glueball@xcite",
    ", we shall adopt another mixing scheme which can be related to the mass matrix to describe the mixing of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , then we can discuss some properties of the mass matrix based on our preferred results .",
    "in addition , we shall consider the possibility that the glueball components exist in @xmath0 and @xmath1 when we investigate the hadronic decays of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 into two pseudoscalar mesons , and check whether these new data are sensitive to the possible glueball components of @xmath0 and @xmath1 or not .",
    "based on three euler angles @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the mixing of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be described as : @xmath19 with @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ; @xmath26 ( @xmath27)@xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 ( @xmath31)@xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , and @xmath34 ,  @xmath35 ,  @xmath36 . one advantage of this mixing model is only 3 unknown parameters with the definite changing ranges .",
    "considering that the glueball components possibly exist in the final isoscalar pseudoscalar mesons@xcite , for the hadronic decays of @xmath37 ( here and below , @xmath38 ) into pseudoscalar meson pairs , we consider the following coupling modes as indicated in fig .",
    "1 : i ) the coupling of the @xmath39 components of @xmath37 to the final pseudoscalar meson pairs , ii ) the coupling of the glueball components of @xmath37 to the final pseudoscalar meson pairs via @xmath40 intermediate states , iii ) the coupling of the glueball components of @xmath37 to the glueball components of the final isoscalar pseudoscalar mesons , and iv ) the coupling of the glueball components of @xmath37 to the @xmath39 components of the final isoscalar pseudoscalar meson pairs . based on these coupling modes , the effective hamiltonian describing the hadronic decays of @xmath37 into two pseudoscalar mesons can be written as@xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 describe the effective coupling strengths of the coupling modes i ) , ii ) , iii ) and iv ) , respectively . @xmath46 and @xmath47 are @xmath48 flavor singlets describing the glueball components of @xmath37 and the final isoscalar pseudoscalar mesons , respectively . @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the glueball content of @xmath51 ( here and below @xmath52 , @xmath1 ) . @xmath53 and @xmath54 are @xmath55 flavor matrixes describing the @xmath56 components of @xmath37 and the final pseudoscalar mesons , respectively .",
    "@xmath53 can be written as @xmath57 @xmath54 can be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the @xmath61 , @xmath62 contents of @xmath51 , respectively , and they satisfy @xmath63      for @xmath78 and @xmath8 , the contribution of the coupling mode iv ) given in our present work differs from that given in ref.@xcite since we do nt adopt the assumption employed by ref.@xcite that the coupling of the glueball components of @xmath37 to the @xmath56 components of the isoscalar pseudoscalar mesons occurs dominantly through their @xmath62 content in chiral symmetry .",
    "in addition , even under this assumption ( i.e. , @xmath59 in the terms containing @xmath79 is set to be zero ) , for @xmath8 , the contribution of the mode iv ) should be proportional to @xmath80 but not @xmath81 given by ref.@xcite .",
    "before performing the fit to determine the glueball - quarkonia content of @xmath37 , we should first determine the parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath50 .",
    "we will adopt the mixing scheme mentioned above to discuss the mixing of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath82 .",
    "recently , the mixing of the three states based on a mass matrix has been discussed in ref.@xcite . based on the equations ( 22)@xmath67(29 ) in appendix",
    "a , the @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are determined as @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath50 are determined as @xmath86 with @xmath87 , which is consistent with the results given by refs.@xcite .",
    "if we set @xmath17 and @xmath18 to be zero , i.e. , we do not consider the possible glueball components of @xmath51 , the mixing angle of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is determined to be the value of @xmath88 which is in good agreement with the value of @xmath12 given by@xcite , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are determined as @xmath89/\\sqrt{3},\\\\ & & x_{\\eta^\\prime}=-y_\\eta=[\\sin(-15^\\circ)+\\sqrt{2}\\cos(-15^\\circ)]/\\sqrt{3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath90 .",

    "the predicted and measured results are shown in table i.    in order to investigate whether the new data given by ref.@xcite are sensitive to the possible glueball components of @xmath0 and @xmath1 or not , we perform the fit to the data presented in table iii in two cases : a ) @xmath92 and b ) @xmath93 . in the fit procedure , we take @xmath94 gev , @xmath95 gev , @xmath96 gev@xcite , and use the average value of 194 mev for the decay momentum @xmath97@xcite since @xmath6 lies very near to the threshold in the @xmath98 decay mode . in fit",

    "the physical states @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 can be given by @xmath104    from eq .",
    "( 16 ) , one also can obtain @xmath105 this prediction can provide a test for the consistency of our results .",
    "now we wish to discuss the properties of the mass matrix which can be used to describe the mixing of the scalar mesons based on our preferred results . in the @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 basis",
    ", the general form of the mass matrix @xmath109 describing the mixing of the quarkonia and a glueball can be written as@xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 represent the masses of the bare states @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively ; @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) is the amplitude of @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) annihilation and reconstruction via intermediate gluons states ; @xmath116 is the amplitude of the transition between @xmath106 and @xmath107 ; @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) is the amplitude of the transition between @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) and @xmath108 .",
    "if @xmath114 , @xmath116 and @xmath115 are set to be zero , and @xmath117 is assumed to be equal to @xmath118 , eq .",
    "( 16 ) would reduced to the form employed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the physical states @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are assumed to be the eigenvectors of the mass matrix @xmath109 with the eigenvalues of @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , then we can have @xmath122 comparing eq .",
    "( 16 ) with eq .",
    "( 19 ) , we have @xmath123 then the numerical form of the mass matrix can be given by @xmath124    eq .",
    "( 21 ) shows that @xmath116 is very small .",
    "if @xmath114 and @xmath115 also can be expected to be very small , the mass level order of the bare states @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 would be @xmath125 , which is consistent with the argument given by refs.@xcite while disagrees with the prediction that the glueball state has a higher mass than the @xmath56 state@xcite .",
    "otherwise , the mass level order of @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 in scalar sector would remain unclear .",
    "in addition , eq .",
    "( 21 ) implies that the mass of the pure scalar glueball is about @xmath126 gev , which is consistent with the lattice qcd prediction@xcite .",
    "a salient property of eq . ( 21 ) is that @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "this shows that the amplitude of the transition between @xmath106 and @xmath108 is negative while the amplitude of the transition between @xmath107 and @xmath108 is positive , which disagrees with the assumption that @xmath129 in the model@xcite .",
    "in fact , in the scalar sector , @xmath117 and @xmath118 should be nonperturbative effects dominantly , there are not convincing reasons to expect that the relation between @xmath117 and @xmath118 should behave as @xmath129 .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 are inconsistent with that @xmath99 and @xmath100 should be less than the unit , the prediction given by the perturbative theory .",
    "we find that if we restrict that @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath79 in the viewpoint of the perturbative theory , i.e. , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 , the @xmath91 increases from 2.05 to 3.80 , but the results given above are not much altered .",
    "however , in the scalar sector , there are not any convincing reasons to expect that the perturbative theory should be valid .",
    "the values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 imply that the nonperturbative effects in the scalar sector could be rather large .",
    "using three euler angles , we introduce a mixing scheme to describing the mixing of the isoscalar scalar mesons . in this mixing framework ,",
    "considering the four coupling modes as shown in fig . 1 , we construct the effective hamiltonian to investigate the two - body hadronic decays of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the glueball - quarkonia content of the three states is determined from the fit to the new data about the hadronic decays of the three states presented by the wa102 collaboration .",
