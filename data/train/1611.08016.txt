    "<S> we demonstrate pixelation - free real - time widefield endoscopic imaging through an aperiodic multicore fiber ( mcf ) without any distal opto - mechanical elements or proximal scanners . exploiting the memory effect in mcfs the images in our system </S>",
    "<S> are directly obtained without any post - processing using a static wavefront correction obtained from a single calibration procedure . </S>",
    "<S> our approach allows for video - rate 3d widefield imaging of incoherently illuminated objects with imaging speed not limited by the wavefront shaping device refresh rate .    </S>",
    "<S> fiber - optic microendoscopes allow for minimally invasive high - resolution imaging deep within living organisms . over the last decades they continue to gain in versatility with the miniaturization of fiber - based devices and multimodal imaging capabilities . </S>",
    "<S> a new class of such devices , fiber - based lensless endoscopes , operating without any distal optical or mechanical elements , enabled extreme miniaturization of the probe dimensions down to a few hundred micrometers , permitting minimally invasive imaging @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> image formation in the lensless endoscopes , capable of producing focal planes at various distances from the fiber tip , relies on either raster scanning or widefield modalities . in order to reach real - time image acquisition rates , </S>",
    "<S> these systems require in the former case ultrafast devices capable of wavefront shaping ( typically deformable mirrors ) or beam scanning @xcite , or real - time computation in the latter @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we show that , using a slow wavefront - shaping device ( spatial light modulator , slm ) and an mcf with weakly coupled cores , it is straightforward to achieve conventional widefield imaging in real time using a single calibration procedure . building on the framework developed for imaging through scattering media @xcite and relying on the practically infinite optical memory effect in such mcfs @xcite , we demonstrate widefield imaging of incoherently illuminated objects .        a conceptual illustration for our technique with the corresponding numerical simulation is depicted in figure [ fig : img1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the schematic in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img1]a represents a conventional widefield microscope where light , scattered from an incoherently illuminated object , gets collected by a 4__f _ _ system , thus forming an image on the other side of it . </S>",
    "<S> for such an imaging system with a lateral intensity point spread function @xmath0 , image intensity distribution @xmath1 is related to the object @xmath2 through a convolution operation : @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> typically , an mcf acts as an imaging conduit , transmitting object information from one fiber endface to another . in earlier implementations , </S>",
    "<S> the individual cores sample the object directly @xcite , giving rise to two important restrictions : i ) pixelation due to inter - core separation and ii ) imaging restricted to fiber facet itself , putting the probe in contact with the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to operate at flexible working distances is highly desirable in context of endoscopic applications . in our previous works @xcite , we reported mcf devices meeting both of the mentioned requirements . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of a wavefront shaping device and an mcf can effectively function in a manner analogous to the common 4__f _ _ system . </S>",
    "<S> a considerable difference being its psf , which exhibits significant side lobes . </S>",
    "<S> they arise from the fact that the pupil of an mcf is segmented and such discontinuities give rise to prominent side lobes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn affects the image , transmitted through the system , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img1]b , resulting in ghost images of the object . </S>",
    "<S> recently we showed @xcite that the randomness in the mcf core positions can lead to a considerable reduction of the side lobes intensity in the psf of such an imaging system . </S>",
    "<S> a simulation of an imaging experiment with such an aperiodic mcf is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img1]b , where the psf is calculated given the cores distribution in the real fiber used throughout this work . while the images exhibit replicas of the object , their intensity is at least 2.5 times lower compared to the central image . </S>",
    "<S> commercial fiber bundles do exhibit variations in core geometry and spacing in view of decreasing the inter - core coupling @xcite , hence we expect a larger reduction in the side lobe intensity @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> implementations of the mcf with wavefront shaping , reported so far , have all employed raster scanning for imaging @xcite . unlike in endoscopes based on multimode fibers ( mmf ) , this becomes trivial in mcfs due to their very large memory effect @xcite . as there is little or no cross - talk between fiber cores , </S>",
    "<S> the transmission matrix of an mcf is practically diagonal . </S>",
    "<S> hence , any phase gradient at the proximal end is preserved during light propagation through the fiber . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon has been employed to remotely scan the beam by applying a global tip - tilt on the composite wavefront entering the mcf . </S>",
    "<S> since these are relatively simple patterns , the slm can now be decoupled from having to perform the scanning and conventional galvanometer - based scanners were employed allowing imaging rates of 11 fps @xcite .    in this letter , we propose and demonstrate the extension of the memory effect of mcfs to the widefield imaging framework . </S>",
    "<S> the reasoning is relatively straightforward , since a translation of a point source in the object plane would result in a phase gradient which is preserved through the fiber ( linear in case of the transverse plane and quadratic for the axial plane ) . </S>",
    "<S> this results in an accurate mapping of any object shift to the image . </S>",
    "<S> these concepts are reminiscent of earlier experiments in scattering media @xcite , and the additional key advantage in the case of the mcf being that the memory effect does not play a limiting role in the imaging process .    </S>",
    "<S> m. ( d ) measured psf profile at @xmath4  @xmath5 m from the mcf distal end in the center ( solid ) and on the edge ( dashed ) of the fov . </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) off - axis psf evolution over the fov : ratio between the central peak @xmath6 and the brightest speckle @xmath7 intensities ( top ) ; fwhm of the central peak ( bottom ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the experimental evaluation of such widefield incoherent imaging employing the memory effect to enhance speed and simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> the novel design and the original fabrication approach of this fiber were previously reported in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : img2]c depicts the fiber fabricated with the following parameters : individual core diameter @xmath8 @xmath5 m , its numerical aperture @xmath9 , master triangular lattice pitch @xmath10 @xmath5 m , and the randomness parameter pr  @xmath11 ( see @xcite for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the outer diameter of the probe is about 360  @xmath5 m ( fig .  [ fig : img2]c ) and the length of the fiber used in this experiment was 40  cm , ensuring no considerable inter - core group delay dispersion @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a simplified scheme of the experimental set - up , used for the widefield imaging with this mcf , is shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img2]a , b . </S>",
    "<S> the laser beam from a femtosecond source ( amplitude systmes t - pulse , @xmath12  nm , 180  fs , 50  mhz ) is extended with a telescope ( l1 , l2 ) to overfill the aperture of the 2d liquid crystal slm ( hamamatsu x10468 - 07 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is used to shape the segmented wavefront entering the mcf via its proximal endface . during the initial system calibration step , </S>",
    "<S> a microlens segment inscribed on the slm for each individual fiber core produces a focal spot at the focal length @xmath13 from the slm face , and is spatially scanned around its initial position in order to optimize the coupling into the corresponding core . </S>",
    "<S> the array of the optimized focal spots is then imaged onto the mcf proximal endface via a system of lenses ( l3 , mo1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a focal plane ip is created at a distance @xmath4 @xmath5 m away from the mcf distal end and imaged via another telescope system ( mo2 , l4 ) onto a camera ( ccd1 ) for calibration and testing purposes . </S>",
    "<S> output polarization from different cores of such non polarization maintaining mcf is arbitrary @xcite , therefore we employ a linear polarizer ( p , thorlabs lpnir100 ) to discard any concomitant effects . after the initial system calibration and compensation of the distal wavefront for the intrinsic mcf phase distortion , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains a characteristic psf ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img2]d ) comprising a central spot surrounded by six dimmer replicas distributed on a circumference with @xmath14  @xmath5 m . in the linear imaging regime , </S>",
    "<S> the brightest speckle contrast relative to the central peak ( @xmath15 ) is 0.4 , measured in the field of view ( fov ) center ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img2]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> we verify the psf variation across the fov , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img2]e we summarize such measurements for off - axial points , showing the variation of psf fwhm less than 1  @xmath5 m and @xmath16 @xmath17 on the fov edge , which should not drastically decrease the imaging performance of the widefield technique .    </S>",
    "<S> using this fiber , we perform a series of proof - of - concept experiments , described in the following . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental set - up , used for the fiber calibration ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img2]a ) , features two conjugate focal planes : op and ip ( where a particular distance @xmath18 for the ip can be flexibly chosen during the calibration step ) . unlike the calibration step , where it is required to have a spatially and temporally coherent source , </S>",
    "<S> the following imaging experiments are performed with spatially incoherent illumination of the object ( nevertheless , the bandwidth of the illumination source has to be smaller than the speckle spectral correlation width ) . </S>",
    "<S> we now perform an incoherent projection of an amplitude mask from the op to the ip plane ; we denote such operation as forward projection . </S>",
    "<S> the related experiment is performed with a reflective object from united states air force ( usaf ) resolution chart ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img3]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the phase mask on the 2d - slm is the same used to correct for the intrinsic mcf phase distortion and does not change throughout the experiment , unless one wishes to switch the projection to another working plane ( different @xmath18 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a number 5 target ( object height @xmath19  @xmath5 m ) was placed in the op and illuminated incoherently by placing a rotating diffuser ( d in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img2]a ) between the object plane and the laser source . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the diffuser along the beam propagation direction is chosen to create in the op a sufficiently large illumination area , slightly exceeding the dimensions of the used mask . </S>",
    "<S> the measured projection in the ip is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img3]b ; it is clear that the set - up performs like a conventional 4__f _ _ imaging system with only a single calibration aided by the memory effect . as the slm does not need to be updated </S>",
    "<S> any further , we can easily perform high speed image acquisition ( exposure time for the presented example was 30  ms ) . for a real - time imaging experiment of a moving target , see * visualization 1*.    m. ]    next </S>",
    "<S> , we perform a widefield imaging experiment in the epi direction , using the modified set - up shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img2]b . in this configuration </S>",
    "<S> the spatially incoherent illumination ( the same as for the forward projection experiment ) reaches the sample plane ( op ) after passing the mo2 , and the ip is matched directly to the ccd2 camera plane ( note that the physical locations of ip and op are switched as compared to the forward projection experiment ) . </S>",
    "<S> a linear polarizer ( p ) is used after the mcf proximal end in the same scope as in the forward projection set - up , as we measure only the scalar transmission matrix @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use two types of usaf targets  positive and negative  to compare the operation of our imaging system in different sample configurations , particularly in terms of the influence of the side lobes . in the first case we use a positive target consisting of number 6 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img3]c ) ; object height is @xmath20 @xmath5 m , which is almost 3 times less compared to the distance between the side lobes of the system psf . </S>",
    "<S> this results in an image on relatively homogeneous background ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img3]d ) without any overlaying ghost replicas . in the case of negative target ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img3]e ) , given the object height @xmath19  @xmath5 m and the distance between replicas , the object convolution with the system psf results in ghost images of the object that begin to overlap with the central ( brightest ) 2. unlike in tpef microscopy @xcite where this weak background is screened by the inherent nonlinearity and does not contribute to image formation , these now result in ghost images albeit with reduced intensity . as it can be seen from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img3]f , the image associated with the central lobe is still the brightest one and can be easily distinguished from the background generated by the side lobes and any weak speckle .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that earlier results from our group on the same mcf achieved a fov of 120  @xmath5 m ( 0.064@xmath21 ) , whereas in the present work the illumination area was restricted to cover a fov of @xmath22 50  @xmath5 m ( 0.03@xmath21 ) due to lower experimental snr .     </S>",

    "<S> ( d ) schematic of the sample used in the ( b  d ) experiment . </S>",
    "<S> ( e ) measured depth of field of the imaging system . ]    </S>",
    "<S> another advantage of the direct imaging approach with an slm over speckle - correlation based techniques @xcite for widefield imaging is that our approach offers a degree of optical sectioning due to its 3d transfer function @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we performed an experimental measurement of the depth of field ( dof ) in the following manner . </S>",
    "<S> after distortion compensation , the calculated phase pattern is displayed on the slm in order to obtain a focal plane at @xmath4  @xmath5 m from the mcf distal end . </S>",
    "<S> next , a diffraction - limited point source is placed at different @xmath18 and the dof is evaluated from the stack of images measured at ccd2 , cf .  </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img2]b . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a gaussian distribution ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img4]f ) with fwhm  @xmath23  @xmath5 m , which is in qualitative agreement with the expected dof ( 32  @xmath5 m ) </S>",
    "<S> . then , using the same experimental layout as in fig .  [ fig : img2]b and the same test object as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img3]e , placed into the op at @xmath4  @xmath5 m away from the mcf distal tip , we show in and out of focus images of the target ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img4]a ) by switching the focal planes through displaying on the slm the respective differential phase patterns with no mechanical translation of the sample or the fiber . as expected , the object appears in focus and then is defocused on the ccd2 plane ( ip ) . for the full stack of 12 </S>",
    "<S> imaged focal planes between @xmath24 and 700  @xmath5 m , see * visualization 2*.    considering the measured @xmath25 , we further demonstrate proof of concept optical sectioning experiments ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img4]a ) with a 3d phantom , schematically depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img4]e . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of 50  nm thick layer of gold flakes , deposited onto a 130  @xmath5 m thick glass cover slip ( # 1 ) . from the bottom side of the latter , we stack a positive usaf target ( thorlabs r1ds1p ) in a manner that the separation between two metal layers is equal to the cover slip thickness . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , when introduced into widefield imaging set - up , the gold flakes layer is situated at @xmath181  @xmath26  @xmath5 m away from the mcf distal end , whereas the usaf target layer is at @xmath182  @xmath27  @xmath5 m ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img4]e ) . by adjusting the phase mask on the slm in order to translate the endoscope focal plane along @xmath18 axis , we could acquire clear images at several @xmath18 without moving either the fiber probe or the sample . </S>",
    "<S> images of the two planes of interest  with the gold flake ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : img4]b ) and with usaf target group 7 elements 35 ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : img4]c ) are shown with the overlaying white dashed lines indicating the outline and the position of the gold flake . remarkably , we are able to focus on both these planes remotely using the slm , demonstrating pixelation - free and 3d - resolved imaging . for </S>",
    "<S> the full stack of 8 focal planes , imaged between @xmath4 and 730  @xmath5 m , see * visualization 3*. we believe this is the first ever demonstration of widefield 3d - resolved imaging at multiple depths in lensless endoscopy employing linear contrast and we expect this to be significantly valuable in the context of imaging 3d structures . in the current implementation , the presented widefield lensless endoscope is not resilient to fiber bending which would change the phase dispersion within the mcf . </S>",
    "<S> however , solutions under development may eventually permit real - time compensation of these effects , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated real - time pixelation - free widefield imaging through an aperiodic mcf using the optical memory effect without any distal opto - mechanical elements and requiring no further post - processing . </S>",
    "<S> both the forward projection of an amplitude mask from the proximal to distal side of the endoscopic system and epi widefield imaging were shown . by employing wavefront control at the fiber proximal end </S>",
    "<S> , we showed that our system is capable of optical sectioning  producing clear images of different focal planes within a quasi-3d sample , and it does so without the need to physically displace either the mcf or the sample .    in the future </S>",
    "<S> , we expect that widefield imaging could be combined with nonlinear imaging , e.g. tpef imaging in a lensless endoscope @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fluorescence sources or another broadband illumination whose bandwidth is narrower than the mcf s speckle spectral correlation bandwidth can be also used without significantly affecting the imaging performance ( see @xcite for details ) . considering the robustness , fabrication simplicity of the presented aperiodic mcf with low inter - core coupling , as well as facilitated ultrashort pulse delivery and the small effective probe diameter ( an order of magnitude smaller compared to the existing scanning endoscope solutions ) , </S>",
    "<S> such a fiber emerges as a promising candidate in the scope of miniaturized imaging systems . </S>"
