    "<S> we propose a simple model of gauge mediation where supersymmetry is broken by a strong dynamics at @xmath0tev .    </S>",
    "<S> c  u v   </S>",
    "<S>               one of the simplest and the most natural scenarios for supersymmetry breaking is to assume dynamical supersymmetry breaking at an energy scale of @xmath1(100)tev . </S>",
    "<S> the electroweak scale comes out as a one - loop factor lower scale than @xmath1(100)tev via gauge mediation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scenario contains only a single scale as oppose to other scenarios where the supersymmetry breaking scale and the messenger scale are generated by different mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been known that a concrete model building of such a one - scale scenario is theoretically challenging ( see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for earlier attempts ) . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a simple ( and possibly the simplest ) model with such low scale dynamics where not only the supersymmetry breaking but also the masses of the messenger particles are generated by the effects of the strong dynamics of a gauge interaction .      </S>",
    "<S> a model of the dynamics of the supersymmetry breaking is based on a supersymmetric su(5)@xmath2 gauge theory with five flavors ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 )  @xcite , where the subgroup of a global su(5)@xmath5 symmetry ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) is identified with the gauge groups of the standard model . as we see later </S>",
    "<S> , dynamical supersymmetry breaking is therefore directly communicated to the standard model sector directly  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the only other ingredient of the model is a singlet superfield @xmath8 which couples to @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the superpotential , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( or their composite particles ) serve as the messenger fields once both the scalar- and the @xmath3-term of the singlet obtain non - vanishing vacuum expectation values ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> recently , models of _ the sweet spot supersymmetry _  @xcite based on this dynamical supersymmetry breaking / messenger model have been analyzed in the elementary messenger regime  @xcite and in the composite messenger regime  @xcite . in _ the sweet spot supersymmetry _ , the supersymmetry breaking local minimum at @xmath13 is realized by the gravitational stabilization mechanism  @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we seek another possibility of making @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> to see how the supersymmetry breaking occurs , let us consider the region where the `` messenger mass '' , @xmath14 , is smaller than the scale @xmath15 around which the su(5)@xmath2 gauge interaction becomes strong . in this region , </S>",
    "<S> the model can be described by using mesons , @xmath16 and baryons @xmath17 and @xmath18 . here , we omit the indices of the flavor su(5)@xmath5 symmetry . in terms of the mesons and baryons , </S>",
    "<S> the full effective superpotential is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a lagrange multiplier field which guarantees the quantum modified constraint between the mesons and baryons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 denotes the dynamical scale of su(5)@xmath2 gauge interaction and it is naively related to the scale @xmath15 by @xmath22 with @xmath23  @xcite . by expanding the meson and baryon fields around a solution to the above constraint : @xmath24 ) , ( tr@xmath25=0 ) , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , we obtain a superpotential , @xmath28 which has a linear term of the singlet @xmath8 . here , the ellipses denote the higher dimensional operators of mesons and baryons , and we have neglected non - calculable corrections to the coupling constants which are naively expected to be @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this superpotential shows that there is a supersymmetric minimum at @xmath30 and @xmath31 or @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the singlet @xmath8 has a local minimum at @xmath33 , the mesons and baryons have positive masses squared and the spontaneous supersymmetry breaking is achieved by @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> now , the question is : is there a possibility for the singlet @xmath8 to have a local minimum at @xmath35 ? to address this question , notice that there are non - calculable contributions to the effective khler potential of the singlet @xmath8 from the strong interactions below the scale @xmath15 , @xmath36 here , we have used the `` naive dimensional analysis ''  @xcite , and we expect that the non - calculable contribution @xmath37 has no small parameter . from this khler potential , we obtain a scalar potential , @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the second derivative of @xmath40 with respect to @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this potential shows that there is a possibility that the potential has a local minimum around @xmath42 which is larger than @xmath21 for @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if we take this possibility positively , it is not hopeless to expect that the singlet @xmath8 has a local minimum around @xmath44 by the effect of the non - calculable contributions from the strong dynamics ( see fig .  1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> note that calculable radiative corrections to the khler potential through the diagrams in which the mesons and baryons circulate dominate over the non - caluculable contribution @xmath40 for a small value of the singlet @xmath8 , @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the potential curves up by this contribution .- symmetry like our model , we need to introduce fields with @xmath46-charges other than @xmath47 or @xmath48  @xcite , although we do not require the instability of the origin of the singlet in our model . ] </S>",
    "<S> the masses of the mesons and baryons , however , become comparable to the scale @xmath15 around @xmath49 . hence </S>",
    "<S> , their effects can be overwhelmed by the non - calculable contribution in the region of @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the possibility of the local minimum around @xmath51 can not be excluded by these effects ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a similar discussion ) .    for @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> , the dynamics can be described by using @xmath3 and @xmath4 as elementary fields . in this region </S>",
    "<S> , it can be shown that the potential curves up in the @xmath8 direction by radiative corrections to the kahler potential  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the singlet @xmath8 can not have a local minimum at @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> the above discussion does not exclude the possibility of having a local minimum around @xmath50 where all the calculable contributions are comparable to the non - calculable ones . </S>",
    "<S> put it all together positively , we here assume that there is a local and supersymmetry breaking minimum around @xmath54 , aside from the supersymmetric minimum at @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are positive definite around the local minimum , although the composite description is not quite well for @xmath58 . ] in the following , we consider a model with gauge mediation around the local minimum at @xmath59    . in the dark shaded region , there is a possibility that @xmath60 has a local minimum due to the non - caluculable contribution to the khler potential from the strong dynamics . ]      </S>",
    "<S> the mesons @xmath25 transform as the adjoint representation under su(5)@xmath5 whose subgroup is identified with the standard model gauge group , ( i.e. @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 under the standard group ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the mesons mediate the effects of the supersymmetry breaking to the standard model sector via gauge interactions of the standard model . through loop diagrams of the mesons , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain masses of the gauginos and scalar particles in the standard model sector , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the sum of the dynkin index of the mesons , @xmath67 is the quadratic casmir invariant of the scalar particles , and @xmath68 denotes the gauge coupling constant of the standard model gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> as we discussed above , @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath29 coefficient @xmath71 for the scalar masses denotes non - caluculable @xmath72 contributions from the heavy hadrons which are charged under the standard model gauge groups , while gaugino masses do not get @xmath73 contributions from them . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath74 contribution comes from the diagrams with more @xmath8 inserted . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we achieve a model with gauge mediation with a low dynamical scale , @xmath75 for @xmath76 .    as an interesting prediction </S>",
    "<S> , the gravitino mass can be as small as @xmath29ev , @xmath77 for @xmath78gev . here </S>",
    "<S> , we have used the definition of the gravitino mass , @xmath79 where @xmath80gev denotes the reduced planck scale .    </S>",
    "<S> now several comments are in order . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbativity of the standard model gauge interactions up to the scale of the grand unification theory ( gut ) put a bound on the sum of the dynkin index of the messenger field @xmath81 as @xmath82 where @xmath83gev denotes the scale of gut . for @xmath84gev , </S>",
    "<S> this condition requires @xmath81 as @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the dynkin index of the present model , @xmath86 , satisfies the perturbative condition of the standard model gauge interactions up to the gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> we should also mention the perturbativity of the coupling constant @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling constant @xmath10 becomes small at the high energy scale as a result of the large renormalization effect from the strong gauge interaction of su(5)@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can expect the coupling constant @xmath10 stays perturbative up to around the gut scale , although it is not necessarily required . ) </S>",
    "<S> since there is non - calculable @xmath29 threshold corrections between the value of @xmath10 at the scale @xmath15 and the one at the scale higher than @xmath87 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling rate to the supersymmetric vacuum at @xmath55 per unit volume is roughly given by @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is estimated by @xmath90 for @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the vacuum stability condition within the observable volume and over the age of the universe only requires @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , although our vacuum is not stable quantum mechanically , it has a lifetime much longer than the age of the universe .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we comment on the effects of the supergravity to the scalar potential of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the leading effect of the supergravity comes from the linear term of the singlet @xmath8 in the superpotential which leads to a linear term in the scalar potential , @xmath93 the linear term , however , is negligible compared with the scalar potential in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : scalarpot ] ) around @xmath49 as long as , @xmath94 here we have used @xmath95 for @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> the condition is easily satisfied for @xmath78gev ( @xmath97 ) ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : paraml ] ) ) , and hence , the local minimum we chose is stable against the supergravity effects .    on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the linear term plays an important role to generate the mass of the @xmath46-axion which corresponds to the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath46-symmetry by @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath46-symmetry is broken explicitly by the linear term , the @xmath46-axion obtains a mass  @xcite , @xmath99 the @xmath46-axion couples to the standard model particles through the loop diagrams of mesons which are relevant for the gauge mediation . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , it decays mainly into photons at the cosmic temperature @xmath100mev . </S>",
    "<S> note that for the axion with mass @xmath101mev , final states with hadrons or electroweak gauge bosons are kinematically forbidden . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmic abundance of the @xmath46-axion before the decay ( both from thermal and non - thermal production ) is estimated to be small enough that the decay does not cause a large entropy production . , and </S>",
    "<S> hence , the gravitino abundance produced by the decay of the @xmath46-axion is negligible compared with the one from the thermal bath  @xcite . ] </S>",
    "<S> the decay temperature is also high enough not to spoil the success of the big - bang nucleosynthesis . besides , the above @xmath46-axion marginally satisfies an astrophysical constraint based on stellar cooling rate and supernova dynamics : @xmath102mev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we find that the @xmath46-axion in our model does not cause any cosmological and astrophysical problems .      </S>",
    "<S> we find a very simple model with gauge mediation where the supersymmetry breaking / mediation is realized by a dynamics at @xmath78gev . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the model predicts a very small gravitino mass ( @xmath103ev ) for @xmath78gev , which can be measured at the future collider experiments such as lhc / ilc , by measuring the branching ratio of the decay rate of the next to lightest superparticle  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it should be noted that the present model is also applicable for a wide range of the dynamical scale up to @xmath104gev , ( @xmath105 , @xmath106mev ) , where the condition in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : gravitational ] ) is saturated . </S>"
