    "this will lead to entropy production characterized by the squeeze parameter of the end - of - inflation state  @xcite .    in quantum optics ,",
    "the squeezed state of light can be produced by a variety of nonlinear processes , such as degenerate parametric amplification  @xcite . within the context of improving the sensitivity of the laser - interferometric gravitational - wave detector ,",
    "the technique of squeezed light has been applied to reduce the quantum noise on the test mass  @xcite .",
    "thus , the full - time evolution of a classical object , which couples to squeezed quantum fluctuations , to some extent , may become of great importance in this regard .",
    "very little has been studied based upon our knowledge .",

    "to do so , we treat the charged particle as the system of interest , and the degrees of freedom of the fields as the environment .",
    "the influence of the fields on the charge can be investigated by integrating out field variables within the context of the closed - time - path formalism  @xcite .",

    "when the charge sets into oscillatory motion , we notice that the integrands of the @xmath100-integral in eqs .   and have a breit - wigner feature of the narrow resonance due to weak coupling . the resonance peaks at frequency @xmath75 and has width @xmath140 , which indicates the resonance width decreases with time as @xmath141 and then approaches to the value @xmath76 as the motion evolves into the relaxation regime .",
    "thus , the dissipative backreaction from the electromagnetic fields renders the charged oscillator into under - damped motion .",
    "in addition , the presence of the resonance implies that the effects from the squeezed vacuum state on the charge should depend on whether the band of excited modes overlaps with the resonance peak .",
    "typically , the velocity dispersion will be expected to be much greater in the on - resonance case where the resonance peak lies within the band of the squeezed modes , than in the off - resonance case . in the following sections",
    "the on - resonance and off - resonance cases will be discussed separately .    here",
    "we will consider the narrow band situation , @xmath142 .",
    "the extension of our study to the broad band case is straightforward if more details about the mode dependence of the squeeze parameters are known .",
    "since each mode influences charge s evolution independently , we may split the broad band into many narrow bands within which the squeeze parameters are frequency - independent but may take different values .",
    "thus the result of the broadband case with frequency - dependent squeeze parameters amounts to adding up all effects from the narrow bands .",
    "so , the narrow band example is simple enough to have analytical expressions , but sufficiently sophisticated to capture all essences about how the dynamics of the charged oscillator is affected by the electromagnetic squeezed vacuum state .",
    "we first consider the on - resonance case that the resonance frequency of the charged oscillator lies within the band of the squeezed vacuum modes . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that the mean frequency of the band @xmath88 coincides with the resonance frequency @xmath75 , namely @xmath143 , and consider the situation that the bandwidth @xmath89 is much smaller than the mean frequency @xmath88 in such a way that @xmath144 holds .    at early time @xmath145 ,",
    "the resonance width , which is of the order @xmath141 is greater than the bandwidth of the squeezed vacuum modes @xmath89 , that is , @xmath146 .",
    "so the integrands in eqs .   and slowly varies inside the bandwidth , and can be pull out of the @xmath100-integral by substituting @xmath100 with @xmath88 . as such , this result at the early time regime bears a strong similarity to that of the single - mode case . for narrow resonance under consideration ,",
    "the most dominant contributions of the stationary component come from @xmath147 and @xmath148 because the sum of them contains terms of the form @xmath149^{-1}$ ] around the resonance frequency .",
    "similarly , the nonstationary component is dominated by the term @xmath150 since it varies like @xmath151 in the neighborhood of the resonance peak . by combining the stationary and nonstationary components of @xmath152 , we find that , at early time @xmath153 , the change of the velocity dispersion is given by @xmath154\\,t^2\\,,\\ ] ] which grows quadratically in time , and depends on the bandwidth of the squeezed vacuum modes @xmath89 .    as the time progresses to the regime @xmath155 , the resonance width gradually decreases to a value about the same order of magnitude as @xmath76 , which is smaller than the bandwidth @xmath89 .",
    "thus , it implies that there may exist a transition or crossover of the time dependence of the velocity dispersion at about @xmath106 .",
    "in addition , when @xmath156 , the squeezed modes may start to evolve out of phase with each other .",
    "it may lead to cancellation between the contributions to the nonstationary component from different modes , and slow down the growth of the velocity dispersion .",
    "therefore , analytically we find that the stationary component of @xmath152 in this time regime , @xmath155 , increases linearly in time , @xmath157 heuristically this evolution behavior can also be obtained from the stationary component in eq .   by replacing the bandwidth @xmath89 with the resonance width , which is of order @xmath141 .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that when the bandwidth is wider than the resonance width , the result of the velocity dispersion should not explicitly depend on bandwidth  @xcite . in contrary",
    ", the nonstationary component flattens out , and behaves like @xmath158 it is seen that the growth rate of the envelope of the nonstationary component starts falling behind that of the stationary component since coherence between the squeezed vacuum modes is gradually lost",
    ". this cancellation effect will be more significant as the evolution moves to the relaxation regime .",
    "finally , at much later times , @xmath159 , the nonstationary component falls off with time as @xmath141 , and vanishes eventually @xmath160 but the stationary component of @xmath152 saturates to a time - independent constant as a result of the fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "the saturated value is obtained as @xmath161    since the nonstationary component vanishes at asymptotical times , the velocity dispersion can not be reduced by manipulating the nonstationary component via squeeze parameters in the same ways as is done in the extremely early time regime , and its values is solely determined by the stationary component .",
    "the corresponding modification in the effective temperature is given by @xmath162 where @xmath45 has been put back and @xmath163 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "to arrive at eq .  , we have made an substitution of @xmath164 in eq .  .",
    "compared with the result in ref .",
    "@xcite where the vacuum state of electromagnetic fields is considered , the effective temperature we obtain here is found to depend not only on the oscillation frequency of the charged oscillator , but also on the number of photons @xmath165 in each squeezed vacuum mode .    the full - time evolution of the velocity dispersion of a charged oscillator in the on - resonance case is shown in fig .  [ fi : sdsl ] .",
    "the evolution of @xmath152 in time regime @xmath166 has been zoomed up .",
    "the vertical axis is normalized by the late - time values of the change of the velocity fluctuations @xmath167 .",
    "when the band of the squeezed vacuum modes does not overlap with the resonance peak , we consider the situation @xmath168 , which may have greater effects on charge s dynamics than the other situation , that is , the mean frequency of the band much smaller than the resonance frequency . in the off - resonance cases ,",
    "the stochastic force will not drive the motion of the charged oscillator into resonance .",
    "we may expect that at later times the velocity dispersion should be much smaller than in the on - resonance case .",
    "since each of the @xmath169 terms for the stationary component has a comparable contribution , we have to take all @xmath169 into considerations .",
    "the same is true for the nonstationary component .    at early time @xmath153 ,",
    "the most dominant contributions of the stationary component for the change of the velocity fluctuations is @xmath170\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and that of the nonstationary component goes as follows @xmath171\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the velocity dispersion remains oscillatory in this regime , instead of growing with time as in the on - resonance case .",
    "then , at later moments @xmath172 , the stationary component of @xmath152 reaches a constant , given by @xmath173 where @xmath114 and @xmath174 have been applied .",
    "the nonstationary component vanishes in the end as @xmath175 in comparison with the results of the on - resonance case  , the magnitude of the velocity dispersion in eq .",
    "is in general much smaller due to the presence of the large factor @xmath176 in eq .  .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that in the case of off - resonance , the motion of the charged particle does not evolve in synchronization with the driving force so that the energy flows in and out of the charge constantly , and its velocity dispersion does not accumulate steadily as in the resonance situation .",
    "however , in principle , this off - resonance result might be comparable to that in the on - resonance case , that is , @xmath177 if the mean frequency of the band is sufficiently high and satisfies the condition @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the classical radius of the charge . if we consider the charge as an electron , then @xmath180 , and @xmath181 , which is an extremely small value for the typical choice of @xmath75 in the unit of @xmath182 .",
    "hence , for the electron , @xmath183 is a plausible assumption .",
    "then we find that the mean frequency of the band @xmath88 must be about the order @xmath184 to satisfy the condition .",
    "since the ratio @xmath185 is assumed to be small , the mean frequency of the excited squeezed vacuum states must be much greater than @xmath186 , which is very unlikely if the squeezed light is produced by some nonlinear process in a medium because this frequency value has been much higher than the plasma frequency of typical materials",
    ". therefore under normal circumstances , the velocity dispersion at late time should be much smaller in the off - resonance case than in the on - resonance case .",
    "here the nature of the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic squeezed vacuum state is studied .",
    "we derive the langevin equation of the charge moving in such an environment .",
    "this stochastic approach consistently incorporates both fluctuations and dissipation backreaction of the quantized electromagnetic field on the charge .",
    "the squeezed vacuum state brings in two distinct contributions to the quantum noise .",
    "apart from the stationary noise , there exists a new feature of the nonstationary noise due to the fact that this quantum state is presumably generated from nonlinear processes of particle creation where the time translational invariance is not respected .",
    "we then study the full - time evolution of the velocity dispersion of the charge when it undergoes harmonic motion and couples to the squeezed vacuum modes of the electromagnetic fields .",
    "we find that the presence of the nonstationary noise can reduce the velocity dispersion of the charge from the value solely given by the vacuum state of the electromagnetic fields for an appropriate choice of the squeeze parameters .",
    "this reduction is especially significant when the charge is just about to move . nonetheless , the dissipative backreaction effect , characterized by the decay constant @xmath76 , is increasingly important when charge s motion becomes oscillatory .",
    "we first consider the on - resonance case , where the frequency of the charged oscillator lies within the band of the squeezed vacuum modes .",
    "we assume that the mean frequency of the band @xmath88 is equal to the resonance frequency @xmath75 , and that the bandwidth @xmath89 is much smaller than the mean frequency @xmath88 such that @xmath144 is satisfied .",
    "the change of the velocity fluctuations in general grows with time at early moments @xmath101 . in this time regime , although the stationary component and the envelope of the nonstationary component start growing quadratically with time in the regime @xmath187 , their evolution behaviors go through a transition at @xmath106 , where the excited squeezed vacuum modes gradually go out of phase with each other . after the transition time , in the regime @xmath155 , the increase of the stationary component slows down , and becomes linearly in time , while the nonstationary component falls off much more quickly so its envelope flattens out .",
    "thus the nonstationary component becomes less significant than the stationary component . at later times",
    "@xmath159 , the nonstationary component vanishes like @xmath141 but the stationary component saturates .",
    "therefore , charge s velocity fluctuations will reach a time - independent constant , solely determined by its stationary component as a result of the fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "it also indicates that the squeezed vacuum fluctuations are not always effective in reducing velocity dispersion of the charged particle .",
    "the effectiveness thus depends on the state of its motion .",
    "moreover , the velocity dispersion of the charged oscillator , driven by the squeezed vacuum fluctuations , has been shown to be greater in the on - resonance situation than in the off - resonance case .",
    "it is quite straightforward to extend the current approach to the case of neutral atoms , which couple to the electromagnetic squeezed vacuum state by the atomic dipole moment .",
    "the intrinsic quantum coherence of the squeezed vacuum may introduce the colored noise , which in turns affects the evolution of the atom .",
    "therefore it would be of interest to take the effects of colored noise into account during the processes of the laser cooling of neutral atoms .",
    "in addition , the atom in such a fluctuating environment , driven by any external force , will inevitably move in such a way that the extension beyond the static atom assumption is needed in order to assess the full evolution of its velocity dispersion owing to squeezed vacuum fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "this will be tackled in the near future .",
