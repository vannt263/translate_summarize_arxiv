    "the standard cosmological @xmath0cdm model with very light , weakly interacting neutrinos provides a very good fit to all current cosmological observations using only 6 parameters . adding a significant neutrino mass of order 1 ev worsens the fit and in fact allows for strong cosmological bounds on the sum of all active neutrino rest masses . within the @xmath0cdm model the upper bound at present is around @xmath1 ev , depending on the specific priors and data used @xcite",
    "this limit is almost an order of magnitude stronger than the current upper bound on the effective electron neutrino mass from beta decays .",
    "tritium decay measurements have been able to put an upper limit on the mass of 2.3 ev ( 95% conf . )",
    "@xcite , which translates into an upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses of roughly 7 ev .",
    "very interestingly there is also a claim of direct detection of neutrinoless double beta decay in the heidelberg - moscow experiment @xcite , corresponding to an effective neutrino mass in the @xmath2 ev range .",
    "if this result is confirmed then it shows that neutrino masses are almost degenerate and well within reach of cosmological detection in the near future .    however , the cosmological neutrino mass bounds do depend on a number of assumptions , and are thus not on quite the same footing as the direct laboratory measurements .",
    "many different possibilities have been discussed for alleviating the cosmological mass bound .",
    "the conclusion is that the mass bound is surprisingly robust .",
    "for instance , including cosmological defects has little effect @xcite .",
    "another possibility , which has so far not been investigated , would be if the universe exits reheating at extremely low temperatures . in this case",
    "neutrinos would not fully thermalize before they decouple , and the end result would be that the neutrino number density is smaller than in the standard model @xcite .",
    "recently it was also proposed that neutrinos could be interacting strongly with a new , massless scalar field @xcite . in this model ,",
    "neutrinos annihilate as soon the temperature drops below the neutrino rest mass and transfer all their entropy to the scalars .",
    "the interesting feature of this model is that the neutrino rest mass never plays a significant role during structure formation so that cosmological neutrino mass bounds could disappear entirely . in the present paper",
    "we investigate this model in detail by solving the boltzmann equation for a strongly interacting fluid of neutrinos and scalar .",
    "we find that , although the matter power spectra are indeed almost unaffected by the introduction of neutrino - scalar interactions , the spectrum of cosmic microwave background fluctuations is changed significantly . in the next section",
    "we discuss the formalism needed to study structure formation with a neutrino - scalar fluid .",
    "section 3 discusses a likelihood analysis based on present cmb and large scale structure data , and finally section 4 contains a discussion .",
    "the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite introduces a new scalar field which interacts with neutrinos via a simple scalar or pseudoscalar coupling , @xmath3 here we do not discuss the details of model building , but simply assume that such a coupling exists . in order to allow for almost complete annihilation of neutrinos at the present , the dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath4 , should be @xmath5 for all neutrino flavours .    on the other hand ,",
    "as discussed in @xcite , couplings much larger than this are strongly disfavoured by neutrinoless double beta decay and by supernova observations .",
    "we therefore take @xmath6 to be characteristic of the model . as was also calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the annihilation rate of neutrinos in the non - relativistic regime is roughly @xmath7 this should be compared with the hubble expansion rate which is roughly given by @xmath8 around recombination .",
    "ev for different neutrino masses for @xmath9 .",
    "the horizontal dashed line is @xmath10 at @xmath11 ev.,width=377 ]    as can be seen , even for neutrino masses which are close to the upper bound from @xmath12-decay measurements , the annihilation rate is much larger than the hubble expansion rate until after recombination occurs at @xmath13 ev .",
    "this means that in this model neutrinos and scalars can be treated as a perfect fluid with effectively zero mean free path for purposes of cmb and structure formation calculations .",
    "as will be discussed in the next section this has significant implications for cmb and structure formation .",
    "the evolution of any given particle species can be described via the boltzmann equation .",
    "our notation is identical to that of ma and bertschinger ( mb ) @xcite .",
    "the simplest choice is to use synchronous gauge because the numerical routine for calculating matter and cmb power spectra , cmbfast @xcite , is written in this gauge . as the time variable we use conformal time , defined as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the scale factor . also , as the momentum variable we shall use the comoving momentum @xmath16 .",
    "we further parametrize @xmath17 as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the magnitude of the comoving momentum and @xmath20 is a unit 3-vector specifying direction .",
    "the boltzmann equation can generically be written as @xmath21 = \\frac{df}{d\\tau } = c[f],\\ ] ] where @xmath22 $ ] is the liouville operator .",
    "the collision operator on the right - hand side describes any possible collisional interactions .",
    "one can then write the distribution function as @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the unperturbed distribution function .",
    "this applies to neutrinos as well as to the scalars , but with different @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in synchronous gauge the boltzmann equation can be written as an evolution equation for @xmath26 in @xmath27-space @xcite @xmath28 = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\tau } + i \\frac{q}{\\epsilon }",
    "\\mu \\psi + \\frac{d \\ln f_0}{d \\ln q } \\left[\\dot{\\eta}-\\frac{\\dot{h}+6\\dot{\\eta } } { 2 } \\mu^2 \\right ] = \\frac{1}{f_0 } c[f ] , \\label{eq : boltzx}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",

    "this assumption will be relaxed later .",
    "the perturbation is then expanded as @xmath36 one can then write the collisionless boltzmann equation as a moment hierarchy for the @xmath37 by performing the angular integration of @xmath22 $ ] @xmath38 it should be noted here that the first two hierarchy equations are directly related to the energy - momentum conservation equation . this can be seen in the following way .",
    "let us define the density and pressure perturbations of the dark matter fluid as @xcite @xmath39 then energy and momentum conservation implies that @xcite @xmath40 by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi0 ] ) over @xmath41 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pert1 ] ) is derived and by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi1 ] ) equation over @xmath42 one retrieves eq .",
    "( [ eq : pert2 ] ) .      starting from the general boltzmann equation in synchronous gauge , eq .  ( [ eq : boltzx ] )",
    ", we now introduce interactions by lifting the restriction that @xmath35 = 0 $ ] .",
    "ideally , one should calculate the collision integrals in detail for some explicit interaction .",
    "however , for very strongly interacting neutrinos and scalars it is in fact quite simple to understand how the fluid behaves .",
    "the collision term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi0 ] ) is @xmath43 $ ] and the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi1 ] ) is @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "integrating these two terms over momentum space one gets the collision terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pert1]-[eq : pert2 ] ) to be @xmath45 d \\omega q^2 dq \\epsilon\\ ] ] and @xmath45 d \\omega q^2 dq \\mu q = k^i \\int c[f ] d \\omega q^2 dq q_i\\ ] ] respectively .    looking at particle species @xmath46 , for processes of type @xmath47 , any integral of the form @xmath45 d \\omega q^2 dq a,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is automatically zero because @xmath49 is a collisional invariant . thus , both the above integrals are zero , and the right hand side of the @xmath50 and 1 terms should be zero , reflecting that energy and momentum is conserved in each interaction .",
    "all the higher order terms can be estimated from the relaxation time approximation @xcite , in which @xmath51 = -\\frac{\\psi}{\\tau}. \\label{eq : reltime}\\ ] ] here , @xmath52 is the mean time between collisions .",
    "since the neutrino - scalar fluid is assumed to be very strongly interacting , the collision term dominates all other terms in the boltzmann equation ( since @xmath53 ) unless @xmath54 .",
    "this argument applies to neutrinos as well as scalars , so that for @xmath55 , @xmath56 . in terms of the momentum - integrated equations ,",
    "this means that @xmath57 , so that the fluid experiences no anisotropic stress .",
    "since there are also creation and annihilation processes , @xmath58 , there will be non - zero terms for @xmath50 and 1 , of the form @xcite @xmath59 equivalent to the relaxation time approximation for @xmath47 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : reltime ] ) .",
    "again , since @xmath53 this means that these terms dominate unless @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "altogether , this means that the combined neutrino - scalar fluid can be treated as a single fluid with a modified effective equation of state , @xmath62 the perturbation equations to be solved are eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pert1]-[eq : pert2 ] ) with @xmath63 .",
    "this is exactly equivalent to the fluid of electrons , protons and neutral hydrogen around the epoch of recombination which can also be considered a single fluid because the interaction time scale is much shorter than the expansion timescale @xcite .",
    "the effective equation of state is then straightforward to calculate .",
    "the temperature of the neutrino - scalar fluid , @xmath64 , is found by solving friedmann equation and the equation of energy conservation @xmath65 with the energy density and pressure of each species given by @xmath66    in fig .",
    "[ fig : w ] we show the effective equation of state of the combined neutrino - scalar fluid for a neutrino mass of 1 ev . at @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    "the fluid is extremely relativistic so that @xmath69 . during the annihilation epoch when the rest mass of the massive neutrinos plays a role ,",
    "the pressure is lower .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho ] we show the energy density of neutrinos and scalars for the same model , normalized to that of a massless standard model neutrino . at high temperatures , @xmath70 , whereas after neutrino annihilation it is @xmath71 .",
    "we have calculated matter power spectra for models with a fluid of strongly interacting neutrinos and scalars .    instead of plotting the power spectrum , @xmath72 , we plot the transfer function @xmath73 which is defined according to @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75 is the primordial power spectrum , which is independent of neutrino physics .",
    "we show these transfer function in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] for a standard @xmath0cdm model with parameters @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "the stated mass is for a single mass eigenstate , and all mass eigenstates are assumed degenerate so that @xmath82 .",
    "note that for @xmath83 ev this is unphysical since the mass difference @xmath84 is known from oscillation experiments to be of order 0.05 ev @xcite .",
    "however , this is of no qualitative importance for the analysis .",

    "this is in accordance with the finding in ref .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite only the energy density in the neutrino - scalar fluid was accounted for .",
    "the strong neutrino - scalar interaction means that the fluid does not free - stream , but rather undergoes acoustic oscillations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] we show the difference between the different power spectra on small scales .",
    "the difference on small scales between @xmath85 and @xmath86 is roughly @xmath87 , leading to the conclusion that the difference in the amplitudes of the matter power spectra is @xmath88 .",
    "this is in almost perfect agreement with ref .",

    "cdm models with neutrino masses of 0.01 ev ( solid ) , 0.1 ev ( long - dashed ) , 1 ev ( dashed ) , and 10 ev ( dotted ) , respectively .",
    "the normalization is arbitrary.,width=377 ]",
    "contrary to the matter power spectra there is a significant effect on the cmb , depending on the neutrino mass .",
    "if the neutrino mass is large , neutrinos annihilate before matter - radiation equality , delaying it and thereby increasing the early integrated sachs - wolfe effect .    however , there is also a significant effect from the fact that there is no stress term damping the neutrino - scalar oscillations .",
    "this effectively increases the fluctuation level on scales which are sub - horizon prior to recombination . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] this effect has been illustrated by simply setting all @xmath55 modes equal to zero for standard , massless neutrinos .",
    "physically this corresponds to having neutrinos undergo acoustic oscillations instead of free - streaming .",
    "cdm model with free - streaming ( solid line ) and strongly interacting ( dashed line ) neutrinos.,width=377 ]    as can be seen from the figure , the effect is very similar to introducing a step - like feature in the power spectrum which would increase power on all scales smaller than @xmath90 , which should then be of order the horizon scale at decoupling .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] we show cmb spectra for same models as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . as can be seen",
    "there are several different effects interplaying . for the model with @xmath83",
    "ev , recombination occurs long before annihilation , but for the models with @xmath91 and 1 ev annihilation happens around the same epoch as recombination . since the effective @xmath92 is lower at this point",
    "there is a slight decrease in the early isw effect compared to the @xmath83 ev model .",
    "finally , in the model with @xmath93 ev annihilation occurs long before recombination so that the early isw effect is strongly enhanced because of the additional radiation present during recombination .",
    "cdm models with neutrino masses of 0.01 ev ( solid ) , 0.1 ev ( long - dashed ) , 1 ev ( dashed ) , and 10 ev ( dotted ) , respectively.,width=377 ]    the fact that the cmb spectrum is changed substantially makes it difficult to predict whether these models are in fact capable of fitting current data as well as the standard @xmath0cdm model . since the cmb fluctuations are enhanced on sub - horizon scales , one prediction is that models with higher @xmath94 and/or @xmath95 will produce better fits since such models produce less power around the first acoustic peak . in the next section we present a likelihood analysis of present cmb and large scale structure data for models with a strongly interacting neutrino - scalar fluid .",
    "in order to test how well models with a strongly interacting neutrino - scalar fluid fit data , we have performed a likelihood analysis of cmb and lss data .    as our framework",
    "we choose the minimum standard model with 6 parameters : @xmath94 , the matter density , @xmath96 , the baryon density , @xmath95 , the hubble parameter , and @xmath52 , the optical depth to reionization .",
    "the normalization of both cmb and lss spectra are taken to be free and unrelated parameters .",
    "the only additional parameter is then the neutrino mass , @xmath97 .",

    "we have calculated in detail how structure formation proceeds in models with a strongly interacting plasma of neutrinos and massless scalars .",
    "these models differ from models with standard non - interacting neutrinos because neutrinos annihilate when the temperature drops below the rest mass .",
    "furthermore , in these models the fluid of neutrinos and scalars undergoes acoustic oscillations instead of free - streaming .",
    "the effect is that the matter power spectrum is only minimally altered by a non - zero neutrino rest mass , but that the cmb power spectrum changes significantly , both because of the additional relativistic energy density and the strong coupling of the neutrino - scalar fluid .    for standard , non - interacting neutrinos the neutrino free - streaming sets an upper limit on the neutrino rest mass when",
    "cmb and lss data is combined .",
    "while neutrinos in the strongly interacting models do not suffer free - streaming and therefore produce matter power spectra which are in accordance with standard @xmath0cdm , it is impossible to simultaneously fit cmb and lss data .",
    "models with strongly interacting neutrinos and scalars are therefore strongly disfavoured by observations .",
    "interestingly this also means that although present cosmological observations can not distinguish between very light neutrinos and other types of relativistic energy density , it is possible to say that the relativistic energy density must be in the form of very weakly interacting particles which free - stream instead of oscillating acoustically ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is yet another confirmation of the standard picture of @xmath0cdm cosmology .",

    "<S> such models are strongly disfavoured by current observations . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this leads to the conclusion that the relativistic energy density around the epoch of recombination must be in the form of very weakly interacting particles . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is independent of the specific interaction model . </S>"
