    "one of the most significant advances in the construction of physically interesting equatorially symmetric vacuum spacetimes took place in 1995 , when kordas @xcite and meinel and neugebauer @xcite independently proved a theorem that allowed one to identify such spacetimes from the ernst potentials on the positive @xmath2-axis , the so - called _ axis - data _ , * before * the complete solution was constructed . that this result was not extended to electrovac spacetimes for over a decade",

    "recently , however , pachn and sanabria - gmez @xcite articulated but did not prove a conjecture concerning the electrovac extension .",
