    "henize 2 - 10 ( ) is a blue compact galaxy with quite interesting properties .",
    "it is a nearby starburst galaxy with a heliocentric distance of @xmath5 mpc @xcite . in this paper",
    "we adopt a distance of 9 @xmath6mpc , with @xmath7 km / s , which yields a scale of @xmath845pc / arcsec .",
    "the galaxy shows spectroscopic wolf - rayet features which indicates the presence of a very young starburst region @xcite , and has a slightly sub - solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figks ] shows a rgb - composite image ( in color in electronic version only ) of the central @xmath9 ( @xmath10parsecs ) of he2 - 10 , where most of the current star formation occur .",
    "the blue and green channels are 0.3-convolved hst wfpc archive in @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the red channel is our @xmath13-seeing @xmath0 taken with vlt / isaac .",
    "the bright central nucleus , generally referred to as region a , is an arc of uv - bright super - star clusters @xcite .",
    "it is surrounded by two presumably older star - forming regions .",
    "region b on the east shows a mixed population of blue and red clusters ( only detected in @xmath0 and longer wavelength bands ) .",
    "region c , on the north - west side , has a long tail containing bright red clusters as well .",
    "dust is clearly apparent in this image , as shown by the red filaments observed to the south - east side between a and b. these appear to be blown away from the central region , rapidly dissolving in he2 - 10 s interstellar medium .",
    "assuming for the dust clouds a velocity equal to the typical sound speed in the ism , i.e. 10 @xmath14 km@xmath15s@xmath16 , hence a growing rate of @xmath17pc@xmath18myr , the present radii of curvature of the filaments @xmath19pc yield dynamical ages of @xmath20myr .",
    "region a is also flanked by two compact red sources that are only visible at @xmath0 and longer wavelengths .",
    "these two sources get brighter with longer wavelengths , as shown in figure  [ figmulti ] .",
    "the various colors of the sources hint at a highly heterogeneous dust content , and possibly age differences among the cluster population .",
    "recent observations in the optical , ir , and radio , have brought new exciting facts .",
    "first , the youth of the starburst event in the center was confirmed by stis analysis of the brightest uv / optical knots by @xcite which yielded a coeval formation age of 4 - 5 myr for all optical clusters .",
    "second , the presence and importance of dust in the central region was confirmed by high - resolution mid - infrared observations @xcite : the majority ( 60% ) of the mir emission is confined to a @xmath21 region , compatible in size with the location of the observed starburst .",
    "however the intrinsically large uncertainties in mir astrometry prevented a clear identification of the mir sources .",
    "finally , the radio observations of @xcite evidenced 5 compact radio sources ( hereafter called the radio knots ) characterized by mostly thermal spectra .",
    "the striking morphological resemblance between the radio knots and the mir emission allowed to tie down the location of the mir sources precisely @xcite .",
    "furthermore , comparing with hst images , @xcite argued that most of these radio - mir sources were off - centered , in the dusty area between region a and b. they thus attributed this emission to young ( @xmath22myr ) ultra dense ( ud ) hii regions with ongoing star formation hidden in dense molecular clouds . following this interpretation , @xcite , from @xmath23",
    "m observations , derived that up to @xmath24 o7v stars ( equivalent to @xmath25 lyman photons@xmath15s@xmath16 ) must be hidden in these dense cocoons , and @xcite , from @xmath26 m observations , computed that @xmath27 of dust and gas must be surrounding the ud hii regions and estimated the bolometric luminosity of the brightest mir region overlapping with radio knot 4 to be as much as @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite extended the radio observations and refined the measurement of physical properties of the ud hii regions , in particular an anomalous low mass hii content of 2 - 8@xmath29 was found , attributed to the extreme youth of the objects .",
    "therefore , as of today , he2 - 10 appears as a spectacular case of a starburst galaxy where a large fraction of its most current star formation activity lies completely buried in dust , and has absolutely no visible counterpart .",
    "we present here high - resolution observations in @xmath0 ( @xmath30 m ) with vlt / isaac ( ) , @xmath2 ( 3.8@xmath31 m ) , and @xmath4 ( 4.8@xmath31 m ) bands with the adaptive optics vlt / naos - conica ( ) that give the highest resolution to date of the nucleus of he2 - 10 in the nir , a wavelength regime adequately located between the stellar optical regime and the dust thermal regime . the high quality of the observations allows the identification , for the first time , of bright @xmath2 regions which correlate with radio knots @xcite , and @xmath0 regions that correlate with the optically bright cluster , thus bridging the existing wavelength gap .",
    "we observed he2 - 10 in @xmath0 using isaac at the eso vlt / antu under 0.3@xmath32 seeing ( figure  [ figks ] ) , and in @xmath2 and @xmath4 with the adaptive optics system naos - conica at the eso vlt / yepun , reaching a corrected psf full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 0.12@xmath33 .",
    "the observations were obtained in service mode in 2003 - 2004 .",
    "we used standard observing strategies . in @xmath2 , we alternated exposures between the object and the sky in 15 abba sequences with a throw of 40 . object cubes ( respectively sky cubes ) consisted of 220 ( 110 ) random 0.175s jitter for a total exposure time of 1155s ( 577.5s ) . in @xmath4 ,",
    "as naco was still in early operation , we used the only allowed chopping mode with pre - defined exposure time and a 30chopping throw .",
    "typical strehl ratios of validated exposures were in the range 20 - 25% for both filters .",
    "the abba sequences were combined / substracted using custom iraf scripts .",
    "we performed accurate astrometry reconstruction and photometry as described in the following sections .      in order to compare the astrometry of our naos - conica images with previous multiwaveband observations",
    ", we performed an accurate calibration of the naos - conica to the usno - b based j2000 epoch .",
    "we first calibrated the astrometry of the @xmath0 image using 23 field stars catalogued in the usno - b @xcite , and applied general transformations using the noao iraf routine geomap .",
    "the positional accuracies of the transformations are @xmath34sec and @xmath35 .",
    "we then derived the transformations between the @xmath0 usno - calibrated image and @xmath36 image using four common sources in the central region ( two field stars and two bright clusters ) .",
    "the number of available common sources is too small to derive a robust general transformation but the clear morphological similarities between the @xmath0 and @xmath36 images ( figure  [ figmulti ] ) make us confident that the reconstructed @xmath36 astrometry has an accuracy equivalent to that of the @xmath0 image .",
    "the positional accuracies of the transformations are @xmath37sec and @xmath38 .",
    "the resulting astrometry , computed for all @xmath2 sources , is shown table  [ tabastro ] .",

    "we measured the @xmath11 , h@xmath39 , @xmath12 fluxes from the hst calibrated archive images , on the same positions and aperture sizes , including a systematic centroid position mismatch in the error computation .",
    "all photometric measurements were then calibrated to vega magnitudes using ir standards provided by eso service observing team .",
    "all ancillary data may be found in , under program i d 71.b-0492(a ) .",
    "typically , @xmath2 errors on zeropoints are ca .",
    "10% , because of a highly variable background .",
    "additional uncertainties are due to the anisoplanetism of the fov of view and the different strehl ratio between the photometric standard and the science observations .",
    "both effect are difficult to quantify , but we assume that , because of our large apertures ( @xmath40fwhm ) , the strehl difference will not dominate the systematics and most of the error will actually come from background subtraction .",
    "unfortunately naco s response was not fully known when the @xmath4 data were taken and the standard stars were observed with high adu counts . they possibly reach the non - linear regime of the detector and the derived zero - points from different nights disagree to @xmath41mag .",
    "hence the @xmath4 data are mostly useful for morphology and only deliver a crude photometry .",
    "hst @xmath11 , @xmath42/h@xmath39 , and @xmath12 images were analysed following standard recipes detailed by @xcite .",
    "we extracted the sources of the nucleus with the full - resolution images in order to compare with @xmath2 data , and we convolved the hst data with a @xmath13 gaussian in order to compare with @xmath0 data .",
    "we derived h@xmath39 equivalent width interpolating the continuum between @xmath11 and @xmath12 following @xcite .",
    "we recover the original magnitudes and similar h@xmath39 equivalent widths of @xcite and the v magnitude of knot 4 @xcite using different strategies with smaller apertures within photon and aperture position errors .",
    "all vega calibrated magnitudes were corrected for the galactic extinction of @xmath43 @xcite yielding @xmath44 , @xmath45 @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "we also extracted all sources detected in @xmath0 , @xmath12 and @xmath11 in the outer 1of he2 - 10 ( 0.5@xmath32 aperture size , see figure  [ figlp ] right panel ) .",
    "a special care was taken to check the effect of the larger psf in @xmath0 and hst convolved resolution , compared to hst original resolution .",
    "we computed the total flux lost between unconvolved and convolved point sources for 0.5@xmath32 apertures",
    ". the loss amounts to @xmath50 mag in @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "although substantial in absolute , the correction is negligible in color , hence the color - color diagrams are not affected by the correction applied to the sources of the outer 1 .",
    "finally , another photometric extraction was done on the brightest @xmath2 and @xmath4 sources in order to build the full spectral energy distributions of these regions .",
    "we convolved @xmath2 and @xmath4 images with 0.3  and extracted fluxes around the brightest radio knots in 1  apertures .",
    "the largest source of uncertainty comes from the diffuse background in the inner core of he2 - 10 .",
    "we adopted different strategies to estimate the background in the different bands , in order to account for the variable resolutions and field crowding of the data .",
    "the hst images were sky subtracted using sky annuli of radius 0.3 - 0.5@xmath32 around the objects located in the inner 10@xmath32 of the nucleus , and using annuli 0.4 - 0.6 pix for outer sources ( also for @xmath0 ) . in @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 , we computed the diffuse emission background in annuli of radius 0.3 - 1@xmath33 around the objects located in the inner 10@xmath32 of the nucleus .",
    "we additionally computed 2 sky annuli ( 0.3 - 0.5@xmath33 , and 0.3 - 2@xmath33 ) in order to estimate the systematic errors resulting from the measured flux differences .",
    "sytematic errors of @xmath51 mag were typical .",
    "the @xmath4 magnitudes have higher systematics due the uncertainty on the zeropoints .",

    "the @xmath4 image is much shallower than the @xmath2 image , and only the three reddest sources are robustly detected .",
    "as is evident from this figure , and also from table  [ tabastro ] , the @xmath2 and @xmath4 sources are clear counterparts to some of the radio knots , and because of the strong morphological and physical association between the radio and mir emissions , to the mir sources as well .",
    "figure  [ figcontour ] shows a precise comparison of the @xmath2 images ( gray scale ) with @xmath54 gemini / oscir @xmath54 contours ( left , the @xmath54 source associations to the radio knots are according to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and with vla 2-cm contours ( right , with the radio knots identification of * ? ? ?",
    "it is striking to see , on fig  [ figcontour ] , how well sources l1 and l5 correlate with the n - band sources .",
    "furthermore figure  [ figmulti ] also demonstrates the association of l4a with the brightest source in f814w , and of l6 , l3a and l3b with the string of three clusters detected west of the brightest source in f814w .",
    "therefore , in constrast to the statement of @xcite , we see a clear connection between the structures observed from 0.5@xmath31 m to 2 cm .    at this stage",
    "it is important to stress that the positional association from the optical to the radio that we present here is not a new proposition that we are making , but is a fact imposed by the astrometry .",
    "the hst , @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 images are now tied to the same astrometric reference , which is the usno - b astrometry .",
    "this is accurate to @xmath56 which will be the dominant positional uncertainty in this wavelength regime ( for instance the relative astrometric accuracy of naos - conica is @xmath57 ) .",
    "the absolute astrometry of the vla is accurate to @xmath58 . with these accuracies",
    ", it becomes impossible to accept the relative positions of the hst and mir / radio sources as presented in @xcite , i.e. a shift of 1.2   in @xmath39 , even taking into account the beam size of the vla , which is 0.4  in @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , the main source of astrometric error in previous papers was an incorrect astrometry in the hst data used at the time .",
    "this is now corrected in the archived versions of the same data .",
    "therefore figure  [ figmulti ] now reveals for the first time the correct evolution of the central region of he2 - 10 from the optical to the radio .",
    "this allows now to present a much firmer identification of the different components across the spectrum .",
    "l1 is clearly detected in @xmath4 and can now be associated to the western n band source .",
    "it has a rather faint counterpart in @xmath0 and is no longer detected in the optical bands , and shows a clear anti - correlation with h@xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ figha ] ) .",
    "figure  [ figcontour ] shows that l1 appears to fall between the radio knots 1 and 2 , however this time the shift is too small to be significant .",
    "since l1 is accompanied by a faint source l2 , we propose to associate the two sources l1 and l2 with knot1 and knot2 in the radio map .",
    "l2 has no counterpart in the optical bands , an anti - correlation with h@xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ figha ] ) , much like l1 , but is much fainter .",
    "source l3a and l3b have clear optical and h@xmath39 counterparts west of the brightest optical source ( cf .",
    "[ figha ] ) .",
    "they fall in a region of diffuse n - band emission and their association with knot3 is unclear .",
    "the brightest @xmath2 source l4a is the counterpart of the main source in the f814w image .",
    "it is fainter in the h@xmath39 image but reappears strongly in the f555w image .",
    "again l4a appears displaced from its possible radio and mir counterpart knot4 .",
    "in fact it is quite likely that knot4 and the associated brightest mir source are the counterparts of the group l4b , c and d. these sources are easily detectable in the optical wide bands and are quite strong in h@xmath39 .",
    "l5 is another bright source that has no optical or h@xmath39 counterpart ( fig .",
    "[ figha ] ) but is cleary detected in @xmath0 , n and radio and can be associated with knot5 .",
    "l6 has no clear radio or mir counterpart but is associated to the optical cluster just west of the brightest f814w source .",
    "finally l7 and l8 have no definite counterparts but are associated with diffuse emission in all bands .",
    "we emphazise that the fact that we detect spatially correlated sources accross the spectrum does nt mean that we actually detect the _ same _ sources .",
    "an error of 0.2  translates to 9pc at he2 - 10 s distance , while the compact sources are not expected to have sizes much larger than 1 - 2pc , hence the @xmath2 sources and radio knots could belong to contiguous yet distinct star forming regions .",
    "a robust identification will have to wait for deeper @xmath2 observations and higher resolution radio observations .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to follow the working hypothesis that association between radio and nir sources is indeed a physical one .",
    "we selected the sources likely to be clusters at 9  mpc with a magnitude threshold of @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "table [ tabcmd ] shows the corresponding vega magnitudes of the 12 central sources ( fig  [ figlp ] ) .",
    "all 12 sources seen in @xmath2 would still be too bright to be supergiant stars if henize 2 - 10 was at a distance of 6  mpc , but 2 sources out of the 21 outer sources detected in @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath0 would fall below the threshold .",
    "we plot @xmath62 vs @xmath63 , @xmath62 vs @xmath64 and @xmath62 vs @xmath65 colors in figure  [ figcmd ] along with the dust free starburst99 ( * ? ? ? *",

    "the sharp turnoff seen in @xmath62 vs @xmath65 correspond to 6.3myr , after which nebular emission ceases to be important .",
    "the 12 sources of the nucleus are plotted as squares the size of which relate to the total errors .",
    "the source of the outer 1are plotted as filled triangles for the sources belonging to the regions b and c of the north - east and west / north - west ( fig .",
    "[ figks ] ) , and as circles for sources falling at least 1away from the nucleus ( all circles happen to be in the southern part of he2 - 10 , visible as bright blue [ probably foreground ] clusters in fig .  [ figks ] ) .",
    "photometric errors are typically contained within the size of the symbol , but systematics related to the diffuse background subtraction can be of the order of 15% .",
    "the solid arrows show the direction and the amplitude of a screen extinction of @xmath66 mag ( assuming a calzetti form instead of the canonical galactic extinction curve does not change the values by more than 3% in the range 0.55@xmath31m-3.8@xmath31 m ) .",
    "all diagrams show the well - known age - extinction degeneracy of optical colors ( here @xmath62 ) , as well as the gradual decrease of the extinction impact on colors as one goes to the infrared .",
    "all show that most of the data points can not be explained by reddenning any point of the models by any amount of screen extinction , especially for the diagrams including the @xmath2 photometry .",
    "this is a rather common observation in starburst regions @xcite .    on the top left panel ,",
    "the squares and the triangles seem to occupy the same locus whereas the circles are shifted up by @xmath67mag",
    ". this shift can be due to a systematic effect in the background subtraction although unlikely because the colors of triangles and squares were derived with independent methods ( cf section [ photometry ] ) and still lies on top of each other , hence do not seem to be dominated by systematics .",
    "the shift more likely comes from an infrared excess affecting the central sources of he2 - 10 .",
    "this conclusion finds some support in the large excesses of @xmath64 and @xmath65 colors observed for the 12 central sources in the other two color - color diagrams .",
    "these infrared color excesses can have a number of explanations that will be explored later .",
    "but let us first characterize the magnitude of the extinction affecting the central sources .",
    "this will help us setting constraints on clusters ages as well as on their actual infrared excess from their location in the color - color diagrams .    as expected in a complex region such as revealed by figure  [ figks ]",
    ", extinctions measured at different wavelengths do not agree well with one another .",
    "first @xcite measure @xmath68=2.3 from optical observations while @xcite correcting for the contribution of stellar absorption features obtain @xmath69 .",
    "then we can use the observation of @xcite to derive the extinction of the central part of he2 - 10 from the h@xmath39 to br@xmath70 ratio .",
    "@xcite measure a br@xmath70 flux of 6.3@xmath71erg@xmath15s@xmath72@xmath73 over an aperture of 2.4x15.6centered on the k bright nucleus . from the hst h@xmath39 image we measure the h@xmath39 flux on the same aperture and obtain a value of 1.86e-12 erg / s / cm2 .",
    "assuming an intrisic h@xmath39/br@xmath70 ratio of 155.4 corresponding to te=7500k , ne=1000@xmath74 @xcite we find @xmath75 . finally ,",
    "from the ratio br@xmath70/br10 of vanzi & rieke we obtain @xmath68=10.5 which is in full agreement with the extinction derived using the br@xmath39 , br@xmath70 fluxes of @xcite .",
    "we thus observe a clear trend of increasing extinction from the optical to the ir which is typical of a system where the absorbing material , gas and dust is mixed with emitting sources .",
    "it is worthwhile to note here that correcting the clusters for extinction will bring them closer to the youngest part of the sb99 .",
    "but this correction can not explain the significant red excess observed in @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 for all the central sources .",
    "this red excess was also observed in a similar diagram built for ngc5253 @xcite and for haro3 @xcite , and most likely has the same origin : a contribution of hot dust in the nir bands .",
    "indeed as the earliest evolutionary phase of star clusters occurs deep in molecular clouds , we can expect to find dust and molecular clouds in the immediate vicinity of these clusters .",
    "dust close to its sublimation temperature would be able to contaminate the @xmath2 band .",
    "using radiative transfer models , @xcite showed that the location of the reddest clusters in the ( @xmath62,@xmath65 ) diagram of ngc5253 , could be explained by a combination of extinction , scattering and emission by dust in a shell around the cluster .",
    "this is likely what we observe here as well . in that respect ,",
    "it is noteworthy that the three reddest sources in @xmath65 are l1 , l2 and l5 , the sources with no visible counterparts and associated with thermal radio knots .",
    "if we apply to the 12 central sources of he2 - 10 color corrections such as those derived from the modeling of the red cluster in ngc5253 , this will bring all the sources to the bottom left of the diagrams , indicating ages of less than 6.3myr .",
    "we study now the physical properties of the sources which dominates the @xmath2 emission of the nucleus ( fig .",
    "[ figlp ] ) .",
    "the bright @xmath2 sources l1+l2 , l4 and l5 are not or barely resolved with radii @xmath76 or 4.5  pc , l5 is not isolated , there is a faint diffuse emission extending as far as 3 fwhms ( 10  pc ) ( the apertures shown on fig .",
    "[ figlp ] are 22.5pc wide ) .",
    "these sources are not resolved in @xmath4 either ( radii@xmath77 ) .",
    "fig.[figcmd ] bottom panel shows the histogram of the h@xmath39 equivalent width log(ew[h@xmath39 ] ) of the 12 central sources in units of log[ ] ( from table [ tabcmd ] ) and the associated ages according to @xcite .",
    "the histogram peaks at ages @xmath79  myr in agreement with recent works @xcite and with age trends inferred from previous section color analysis .",
    "we emphasize that the h@xmath39 equivalent width measurements are prone to strong systematic effects .",
    "we substracted out the [ nii ] @xmath80 measured to be 31% of h@xmath39 in an unpublished high - resolution spectrum covering the 1.6  around source @xmath81 .",
    "but the main source of error is a poorly - known continuum level .",
    "our method to derive the continuum by interpolation of the contiguous broadband filters continuum for lack of a better estimator is crude and the quoted log(ew[h@xmath39 ] ) should be carefully used .",
    "the measured log(ew[h@xmath39 ] ) centered on the sources l1 , l2 and l5 are 2.60 , 2.66 and 2.37 , yielding ages@xmath82myr .",
    "but the h@xmath39 emission shows remarkable anti - correlations with the source l1 + 2 and l5 and no emission in @xmath11 , @xmath42 and @xmath12 can be clearly associated with source l1 , l2 and l5 .",
    "hence the measured log(ew[h@xmath39 ] ) is probably more related to he2 - 10 foreground medium rather than the @xmath2 emitting clusters .",
    "an interesting check on the age derived from log(ew[h@xmath39 ] ) comes from the sources l3a , l3b , l4a and l6 because all three have unambiguous @xmath11 , @xmath42 and @xmath12 counterparts .",
    "log(ew[h@xmath39])@xmath83 and the brightest source in @xmath2 ( l4a of fig .",
    "2 ) have log(ew[h@xmath39])@xmath83 ( table [ tabcmd ] ) , consistent with the measurements of ( * ? ?",
    "9 ) , yielding ages@xmath846myr , whereas @xcite derived ages of 4 - 5myr fitting single - burst sb99 templates to a de - reddened uv / stis spectrum of the same sources .",
    "thus there appears to be an age dichotomy , with source l1 , l2 and l5 being younger than 5myr and the other @xmath2 source being older .    on the basis of the new identification of the components accross the spectrum ( see section  [ secident ] ) , it is important to review previous assumptions on the nature of he2 - 10 radio knots emission .",
    "the presence of ud hii in he2 - 10 is primarily inferred from observed turnovers from flat radio spectra ( @xmath85 with @xmath86 , characteristic of an optically thin ionized gas ) , to thermal spectra ( @xmath87 , signature of a free - free optically thick gas ) @xcite .",
    "this feature is common in galactic hii regions .",
    "these ud hii regions were presumed to be extremely young , e.g. less than one million year , mostly because of their compactness , their high electron densities , and of their lack of counterpart in the nir and below . indeed only hii regions buried extremely deep in dust , i.e. right at the start of their expansion , would remain invisible in the nir .",
    "since most of the radio sources now have counterparts , the interpretation of the radio knots must be updated .    among the 5 radio sources",
    ", we would only classify knot 1 + 2 and knot 5 , as bona fide ud hii regions .",
    "they have counterparts in the nir but not in the visible .",
    "this implies a significant optical depth ( typically @xmath8810 if we follow existing models of embedded super - star clusters ) , and thus a young age although possibly not as young as previously postulated .",
    "the radio knot 3 was already known to be a different type of source than other radio knots from a strong non - thermal signature @xcite , ( very likely a supernova remnant ) .",
    "we also propose that the radio knot 4 , associated with diffuse @xmath2 emission ( l4b , c , d ) and showing strong correlations with bright optical and h@xmath39 sources , is not an ud hii region but a complex mix of _ normal _ hii regions and supernova remnants .",
    "knot 4 does show a non - thermal signature with a slightly negative spectral index @xmath39 .",
    "the proposed re - classification of the radio sources would lower the total mass of hidden @xmath89 stars ( as deduced from the radio ) by a factor of @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "detailed modelling of the spectral energy distributions is essential to have a deeper understanding of the star formation process ongoing in he2 - 10 , especially of sources l1+l2 and l5 which represent the best candidate for very young dust - enshrouded super - star clusters .",
    "this is however a long endeavour that we differ to a later paper .",
    "nevertheless the present observations outline the importance of high - resolution multiwavelength datasets to disentangle the intrinsically complex nature of star forming regions .",
    "we detected compact sources in the nucleus of henize 2 - 10 with @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 observations using isaac and naos - conica on the vlt .",
    "the sources are compact ( @xmath90  pc ) , highly correlated with radio and mid - infrared ultradense hii regions , previously thought to be optically thick .",
    "the color - color magnitude diagrams show the presence of strong red - excess in @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "such red excesses point at highly heterogeneous dust distribution and at the presence of a hot dust component emitting and scattering down to @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "we tentatively review the previous classification of the radio knots by identifying two bona fide ud hii ( knot 1 + 2 and knot 5 ) and propose that knots 3 and 4 are non - thermal radio sources , akin to supernova remnants .",
    "these new high - resolution data uncover a complex structure in infrared .",
    "we suggest that to understand he2 - 10 star forming history , a detailed model of the radiative processes is needed .",
    "this model should include all known components of the galaxy in a consistent way in order to fit the spectral energy distribution from radio to uv .",
