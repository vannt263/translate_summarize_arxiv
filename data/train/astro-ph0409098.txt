    "the origin of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) above @xmath0ev ( @xmath2eev ) has been challenging physicists for many years  @xcite .",
    "several next - generation experiments , most notably the pierre auger experiment now under construction  @xcite and the euso project  @xcite are now trying to solve this mystery .",
    "although statistically meaningful information about the uhecr energy spectrum and arrival direction distribution has been accumulated , no conclusive picture for the nature and distribution of the sources emerges naturally from the data .",
    "there is on the one hand the approximate isotropic arrival direction distribution  @xcite which indicates that we are observing a large number of weak or distant sources . on the other hand",
    ", there are also indications which point more towards a small number of local and therefore bright sources , especially at the highest energies : first , the agasa ground array claims statistically significant multi - plets of events from the same directions within a few degrees  @xcite , although this is controversial  @xcite and has not been seen so far by the fluorescence experiment hires  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of this clustered component is @xmath3 and thus much harder than the total spectrum  @xcite .",
    "second , nucleons above @xmath4eev suffer heavy energy losses due to photo - pion production on the cosmic microwave background  the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect  @xcite  which limits the distance to possible sources to less than @xmath5mpc  @xcite .",
    "heavy nuclei at these energies are photo - disintegrated in the cosmic microwave background within a few mpc  @xcite . for a uniform source distribution this would predict a `` gzk cutoff '' , a drop in the spectrum .",
    "however , the existence of this `` cutoff '' is not established yet from the observations  @xcite .",
    "the picture is further complicated by the likely presence of large scale extra - galactic magnetic fields ( egmf ) that will lead to deflection of any charged uhecr component .",
    "magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the universe , although their origin is still unclear  @xcite . magnetic fields in galaxies are observed with typical strengths of a few micro gauss .",
    "in addition there is some evidence for fields correlated with larger structures such as galaxy clusters  @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields as strong as @xmath6 in sheets and filaments of the large scale galaxy distribution , such as in our local supercluster , are compatible with existing upper limits on faraday rotation  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that fossil cocoons of former radio galaxies , so called radio ghosts , contribute significantly to the isotropization of uhecr arrival directions  @xcite .    to get an impression of typical deflection angles one can characterize the egmf by its r.m.s .",
    "strength @xmath7 and a coherence length @xmath8 .",
    "if we neglect energy loss processes for the moment , then the r.m.s .",
    "deflection angle over a distance @xmath9 in such a field is @xmath10  @xcite , where the larmor radius of a particle of charge @xmath11 and energy @xmath12 is @xmath13 . in numbers",
    "this reads @xmath14 for @xmath9 .",
    "this expression makes it immediately obvious that fields of fractions of micro gauss lead to strong deflection even at the highest energies .",
    "this goes along with a time delay @xmath15 , or @xmath16 which can be millions of years .",
    "a source visible in uhecr today could therefore be optically invisible since many models involving , for example , active galaxies as uhecr accelerators , predict variability on shorter time scales .",
    "strong deflection also limits the distance @xmath17 a uhecr of given energy can travel during its energy loss time , which sometimes is called a `` magnetic horizon ''  @xcite .",
    "for example , if energy losses are included , for a space - filling field @xmath18ng with @xmath19mpc the propagation distance of uhecr above @xmath0ev is limited to @xmath20mpc  @xcite . for fields @xmath21 g the magnetic horizon would be only @xmath22mpc  @xcite .",
    "quite a few simulations of the effect of extragalactic magnetic fields ( egmf ) on uhecr exist in the literature , but usually idealizing assumptions concerning properties and distributions of sources or egmf or both are made : in refs .",
    "@xcite sources and egmf follow a pancake profile mimicking the local supergalactic plane . in other studies",
    "egmf have been approximated in a number of fashions : as negligible  @xcite , as stochastic with uniform statistical properties  @xcite , or as organized in spatial cells with a given coherence length and a strength depending as a power law on the local density  @xcite .",
    "recently , ref .",
    "@xcite have carried out the first attempts to simulate uhecr propagation in a realistically structured universe ; additional , independent calculations have now followed  @xcite .",
    "so far all of these simulations have been limited to the case of nucleons .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the magnetized extragalactic environment used for uhecr propagation is produced by a simulation of the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "the simulation was carried out within a computational box of @xmath23mpc length on a side , with normalized hubble constant @xmath24 km s@xmath25 mpc@xmath26 = 0.67 , and using a comoving grid of 512@xmath27 zones and 256@xmath27 dark matter particles .",
    "the egmf was initialized to zero at simulation start and subsequently its seeds were generated at cosmic shocks through the biermann battery mechanism  @xcite . since cosmic shocks form primarily around collapsing structures including filaments , the above approach avoids generating egmf in cosmic voids . in this particular case",
    "( more are explored , see below ) the resulting magnetic fields in collapsed structures are rather extended , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( top panel ) , significantly more than in the case of a uniform initial seed field ( fig .",

    "fields in the voids were suppressed to minimize deflection .",
    "the observer is in the center of the figures and is marked by a star .",
    "the egmf strength at the observer is @xmath28 g in the upper panel and @xmath29 in the lower panel .",

    "@xcite the following question was addressed : which observer positions , and source distributions and characteristics lead to uhecr distributions whose spherical multi - poles for @xmath30 and auto - correlation at angles @xmath31 are consistent with observations ? it was found that ( i ) the observed large scale uhecr isotropy requires the neighborhood within a few mpc of the observer is characterized by weak magnetic fields below @xmath32 g , and ( ii ) once that choice is made , current data do not strongly discriminate between uniform and structured source distributions and between negligible and considerable deflection .",
    "nevertheless , current data moderately favor a scenario in which ( iii ) uhecr sources have a density @xmath33 and follow the matter distribution and ( iv ) magnetic fields are relatively pervasive within the large scale structure , including filaments , and with a strength of order of a @xmath34 g in galaxy clusters . a two - dimensional cut through the egmf environment of the observer in a typical such scenario",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "it was also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite how future data of considerably increased statistics can be used to learn more about egmf and source characteristics . in particular , low auto - correlations at degree scales imply magnetized sources quite independent of other source characteristics such as their density .",
    "the source characteristics can only be estimated from the auto - correlations halfway reliably if magnetic fields have negligible impact on propagation . otherwise , the images of sources immersed in considerable magnetic fields are smeared out , which also smears out the auto - correlation function over several degrees . for a sufficiently high source density ,",
    "individual images can thus overlap and sensitivity to source density is consequently lost .",
    "the statistics expected from next generation experiments such as pierre auger  @xcite and euso  @xcite should be sufficient to test source magnetization by the auto - correlation function  @xcite .     with respect to the line of sight to the sources of cosmic rays above @xmath35ev ( upper panel ) and above @xmath1ev ( lower panel ) .",
    "the blue ( thick ) and red ( thin ) curves showing larger and smaller deflections , respectively , are for the two egmf scenarios from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] upper and lower panel , respectively .",
    "the sources follow the baryon density and have average density @xmath36 . shown",
    "are the averages over several realizations varying in the positions and luminosities @xmath37 of individual sources , the latter assumed to be distributed as @xmath38 with @xmath39 in arbitrary units.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]   with respect to the line of sight to the sources of cosmic rays above @xmath35ev ( upper panel ) and above @xmath1ev ( lower panel ) .",

    "@xcite a constrained simulation which approximately reproduces the local universe on scales between a few mpc and 115 mpc from earth was performed and the magnetic smoothed particle hydrodynamics technique was used to follow the egmf evolution .",
    "the egmf was seeded by a uniform seed field of maximal strength compatible with observed rotation measures in galaxy clusters .",
    "the questions considered in this work were somewhat different . in ref .",
    "@xcite deflections of uhecr above @xmath35ev were computed as a function of the direction to their source which were assumed to be at cosmological distances .",
    "specific source distributions were not considered .",
    "the deflections typically were found to be smaller than a few degrees .",
    "interestingly , however , there are considerable quantitative differences in the typical deflection angles predicted by the two egmf models in refs .  @xcite",
    ". these are _ not _ due to specific source distributions : in fact , for homogeneous source distributions , the average deflection angle for uhecr above @xmath35ev obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is @xmath40 above @xmath35ev and @xmath41 above @xmath1ev , much larger than in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition , even if the magnetic field strength is reduced by a factor 10 in the simulations in the environment of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , upper panel , the average deflection angle is still @xmath42 above @xmath35ev , and @xmath43 above @xmath1ev .",
    "this non - linear behavior of deflection with field normalization is mostly due to the strongly non - homogeneous character of the egmf .",
    "recently we have carried out a new simulation in which the initial magnetic seeds are provided by a uniform magnetic field ( instead of the biermann battery ) to check how this different model affects our results .",
    "however , we find that typical deflection angles change at most by a factor of 2 .",
    "this is demonstrated by fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] which compares deflection angle distributions for the two egmf scenarios shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] based on the biermann battery model or uniform initial seeds , respectively . in both the above cases the magnetic fields in a coma - like cluster at @xmath44 were of order @xmath34 g . also , in the case of uniform initial fields we have further suppressed fields in the voids to minimize deflections .",
    "thus the residual differences in the predictions for the deflection angles of uhecr are probably due to the different numerical models for the magnetic fields .",
    "numerical issues may play an important role because they affect the amplification and the topological structure of the magnetic fields , both of which are important for the normalization procedure , see below .",
    "a few examples are provided in the following .",
    "the resolution in ref .",
    "@xcite is constant and in general better in filaments and voids but worse in the core of galaxy clusters than the ( variable ) resolution in ref .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) codes are affected by numerical viscosity to a much larger extent than hydro codes ; for this reason is it advantageous to evolve the magnetic field as a passive quantity because , while the amplification due to compression and stretching is fully accounted for , the additional dissipation introduced by the more complex mhd scheme is avoided .",
    "this is even more worrisome for the case of ref .",
    "@xcite where the numerical dissipation is not quantified .",
    "it is also worth noting that the algorithm employed in ref .",
    "@xcite does not guarantee a divergence - free magnetic field . while it is argued that in the high density regions ( core of galaxy clusters ) the variations of the magnetic fields on a scale of a few resolution elements are larger than the divergence - component",
    ", such conditions do not apply as easily in the low density , low resolution regions such as in filaments .",
    "thus , one may wonder about the reliability of the numerical solution there .    in conclusion , while in both simulations the magnetic fields are normalized to ( or reproduce ) the same `` observed '' values in the core of rich clusters , their values in the filaments are substantially different . while in ref .",
    "@xcite the amplification in cluster cores may be underestimated , the magnetic fields in the filaments are not ruled out by available observational data  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there is some concern for the reliability of the numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite in the low density regions , because numerical effects have not been quantified there .     above ( decreasing curve ) and below ( increasing curve ) a given threshold , as a function of that threshold . upper and lower panels correspond to the panels in fig .",
    "[ fig1].,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]   above ( decreasing curve ) and below ( increasing curve ) a given threshold , as a function of that threshold .",
    "upper and lower panels correspond to the panels in fig .",
    "[ fig1].,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    as a result , the magnetic fields obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite are considerably more extended than the ones in ref .",
    "this can be seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with a similar plot in ref .",
    "@xcite : for the case shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , about 10% of the volume is filled with fields stronger than 10 nano gauss , and a fraction of @xmath45 is filled by fields above a micro gauss . corresponding filling factors for these field strengths in case of ref .",
    "@xcite are @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "this is the most likely reason for the much larger average deflections obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite as compared to the degree scale deflections discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since very little is currently known about the properties of intergalactic magnetic fields , the only solid conclusion that can be drawn at this stage is that the effects of egmf on uhecr propagation are currently rather uncertain .",
    "finally we note that these studies should be extended to include heavy nuclei  @xcite since there are indications that a fraction as large as 80% of iron nuclei may exist above @xmath0ev  @xcite .",
    "preliminary results  @xcite give deflections of @xmath48 above @xmath1ev in our standard scenario shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig3 ] , upper panels .",
    "more importantly , even in the egmf scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite , deflections could be considerable and may not allow particle astronomy along many lines of sight : the distribution of deflection angles in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that deflections of protons above @xmath35ev of @xmath49 cover a considerable fraction of the sky .",
    "suppression of deflection along typical lines of sight by small filling factors of deflectors is thus unimportant in this case .",
    "the deflection angle of any nucleus at a given energy passing through such areas will therefore be roughly proportional to its charge as long as energy loss lengths are larger than a few tens of mpc  @xcite .",
    "deflection angles of @xmath50 at @xmath51ev should thus be the rule for iron nuclei .",
    "in contrast to the contribution of our galaxy to deflection which can be of comparable size but may be corrected for within sufficiently detailed models of the galactic field , the extra - galactic contribution would be stochastic .",
    "statistical methods are therefore likely to be necessary to learn about uhecr source distributions and characteristics . in addition , should a substantial heavy composition be experimentally confirmed up to the highest energies , some sources would have to be surprisingly nearby , within a few mpc , otherwise only low mass spallation products would survive propagation  @xcite .    the putative clustered component of the uhecr flux whose fraction of the total flux seems to increase with energy  @xcite may play a key role in this context .",
    "it could be caused by discrete sources in directions with small deflection . since ,",
    "apart from energy losses , cosmic rays of same rigidity @xmath52 are deflected similarly by cosmic magnetic fields , one may expect that the composition of the clustered component may become heavier with increasing energy . indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was speculated that the agasa clusters may be consistent with consecutive he , be - mg , and fe bumps .",
    "up to @xmath53ev . the blue ( thick ) curves are for an egmf of strength @xmath54 g surrounding the source and the red ( thin ) curve is without egmf .",
    "shown for comparison are the solid angle integrated agasa  @xcite ( dots ) and hires - i  @xcite ( stars ) data .",
    "the solid straight line marks the injection spectrum .",
    "all fluxes have been normalized at 60 eev .",

    "all fluxes have been normalized at 60 eev .",
    "lower panel : the predicted composition in the same scenario.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    this brings us to the impact of egmf on uhecr fluxes from discrete sources . in ref .",
    "@xcite we investigated the impact on cosmic ray observations above @xmath0ev of mpc - scale magnetic fields of @xmath54 g strength surrounding uhecr sources .",
    "the likely case was assumed that magnetic fields within a few mpc around earth are insignificant .",
    "the trajectory simulations are based on the same large scale structure simulation as before , examples of whose egmf distributions were shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig3 ] , upper panels .",
    "we find that such source fields can strongly modify spectra and composition at earth , especially for nearby sources for which the fields can considerably increase propagation times relative to both energy loss and photo - disintegration time scales and to the undeflected propagation time : eq .",
    "( [ delay ] ) shows qualitatively that time delays at @xmath55ev can easily reach @xmath56years for fields @xmath57 g extended over a few mpc .",
    "this is indeed larger than energy loss times @xmath58years and comparable to the straight line propagation time @xmath56years .",
    "we found the following generic features :    we note in passing that spallation and pion production could be enhanced around powerful sources due to an increased infra - red background  @xcite .",
    "while we have not yet taken this into account in the present simulations , we expect this effect to be small compared to the egmf effect .",
    "the spectra are considerably hardened relative to the injection spectrum at energies below the usual gzk - like cutoff where energy loss distance and source distance become comparable .",
    "this is caused by an interplay between diffusion and energy loss : the flux of low energy particles is suppressed because diffusion spreads them out over a larger volume due to their much larger energy loss times .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of uniformly distributed magnetic fields which in general lead to a steepening of the cosmic ray flux below the gzk cutoff . a hardened sub - gzk spectrum from individual sources",
    "would indeed be consistent with the hints of a hard clustered component in the agasa data between @xmath0ev and @xmath1ev  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for a nucleus of atomic mass @xmath59 as injected primary , due to the kinematics of the photo - disintegration reactions a nucleon peak appears at energy @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the maximal nucleus injection energy .",
    "this effect is the more prominent the harder the injection spectrum .",
    "we also found that the details of spectra and composition depend significantly on the unknown details of the magnetic fields and the position of the source therein and can thus not be predicted .",
    "an example demonstrating these effects is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where a source of iron nuclei at 3.3 mpc distance to earth is considered , once without any egmf , and once with an egmf concentrated around the source and reaching @xmath54 g there .",
    "the observer is at the same position as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and the source is in the center of the roughly spherically magnetized region to the lower right of the observer in the upper panel of fig .",
    "the spectral modification for proton primaries ( not shown ) by the egmf would be equally severe as in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  @xcite .",
    "further cutoffs towards low energies can be induced if the source is active only since a time smaller than the typical delay time at this energy . since the latter easily reaches @xmath62years at @xmath0ev in the scenario shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , as can also be seen from eq .",
    "( [ delay ] ) , this is actually quite likely for active galactic nuclei which can have activity time scales below @xmath63years .",
    "obviously , the characteristics of such features also depend on unknown details of the source .",
    "our simulations finally show that even for iron primaries , extra - galactic magnetic fields from large scale structure simulations are not strong and extended enough to explain the observed large scale isotropy of uhecr arrival directions in terms of a single nearby source .",
    "this would require more homogeneous fields such as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "ev in the scenario described in the text for iron primaries , corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( blue , thick curve ) and proton primaries ( red , thin curve).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    next generation experiments such as the pierre auger observatories  @xcite and the euso project  @xcite will accumulate sufficient statistics to establish spectra and distributions of composition and arrival directions from individual sources .",
    "a potentially strong influence of magnetic fields surrounding individual sources should thus be kept in mind when interpreting data from these experiments .",
    "this is true even if uhecr arrive within a few degrees from the source position . as fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows  @xcite , this is in fact the case for proton primaries in our example for a discrete source .",
    "it thus seems evident that the influence of large scale cosmic magnetic fields on ultra - high energy cosmic ray propagation is currently hard to quantify and may not allow to do `` particle astronomy '' along most lines of sight , especially if a significant heavy nucleus component is present above @xmath0ev .",
    "however , even in our simulations , there are lines of sight along which deflection is only a few degrees , at least for proton primaries .",
    "such directions might still be suitable for `` particle astronomy '' .",
