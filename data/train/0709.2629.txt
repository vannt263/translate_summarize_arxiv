    "weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are currently favoured as candidates for dark matter , which makes up about 20@xmath0 percent of the total matter - energy content of the universe .",
    "although the lightest supersymmetric particle , which is the lightest neutralino in many susy models , would make a very good wimp if susy with r - parity conservation is realised in nature , most extensions of the standard model of particle physics contain wimps .",
    "in fact the more general requirement is that some new conserved quantum number makes the lightest of the new particles stable .",
    "the international linear collider ( ilc ) offers the possibility to look for wimps in a rather model - independent way , which first has been pointed out in  @xcite . here",
    ", the expected sensitivity to such a wimp signal , the achievable mass resolution and the influence of beam polarisation are studied using a full detector simulation .",
    "assuming that the cosmic relic density of wimps is determined by pair annihilation of wimps , and that an unknown branching fraction @xmath1 of these annihilations proceeds into an @xmath2 pair(@xmath3 ) , crossing relations can be used to derive an expected cross - section for the reverse process , i.e. @xmath4 .",
    "this cross - section contains as free parameters :    * the @xmath2 branching fraction @xmath1 * the mass of the wimp @xmath5 * the spin of the wimp @xmath6 * the angular momentum of the annihilation s dominant partial wave @xmath7 .    in order that this process be observable in a collider detector , where the wimps themselves leave no signature , an additional photon from initial state radiation",
    "is required : @xmath8 .    the main standard model background process for this reaction is neutrino pair production , again with an isr photon : @xmath9 . at energies significantly above the @xmath10 pole , this reaction is dominantly mediated by @xmath11-channel @xmath12-exchange and can thus be reduced significantly by choosing the appropriate polarisations for the electron and position beams .",
    "therefore we consider three possible scenarios for the helicity structure of the wimp coupling to electrons :    * the same as the sm charged current weak interaction , i.e. only @xmath13 is nonzero * parity and helicity conserving , i.e. @xmath14 * opposite to sm charged current weak interaction , i.e. only @xmath15 is nonzero .    especially in the last case a significant enhancement of the signal over background ratio is expected .",
    "the neutrino background has been generated with nunugpv  @xcite , which is a dedicated generator for neutrino pair production with up to three photons @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 events with at least one photon with an energy @xmath18 8  gev @xmath19 250  gev and a polar angle @xmath20 15@xmath21 were generated at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath22 , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 500  fb@xmath23 .",
    "these events serve not only to describe the irreducible standard model background , but are also reweighted w.r.t .",
    "energy and polar angle of the photon according to the wimp cross - section .",
    "the benefit of the is method is that in this way a signal sample can be obtained for all mass and spin hypotheses to be tested without applying the detector simulation again , which reduces the processing time tremendously .",
    "this sample has been subjected to the full ldc detector simulation , using the detector model ldc01sc with a 4  t magnetic field and mokka  6.1  @xcite .",
    "the events were then reconstructed with marlinreco  @xcite , using the wolf  @xcite algorithm for particle flow and a simple selection demanding @xmath24 10  gev and 20@xmath25 . for the energy resolution studies described in the following , also an angular match to the generated photon was required .",
    "the influence of the detector s energy resolution has been studied at two levels : besides the full reconstruction , the so called cheated reconstruction makes use of the simulation information for associating calorimeter clusters with particles . this way the pure detector resolution and calibration can be disentangled from confusion effects , noise and so on .",
    "figure  [ fig : egamma ] shows the generated ( left ) as well as the cheated and fully reconstructed ( right ) energy spectra of the most energetic photon candidate of the events .",
    "while the peak at @xmath26  gev from radiative returns to the @xmath10 resonance is extremely clear at the generator level , it his heavily smeared after reconstruction , even for the cheated case . the full reconstruction yields even less photons at high energies .",
    "the reason for this effect can be seen in the left plot of figure  [ fig : ncluseres ] , which shows the mean number of photon candiates per generated photon as a function of the generated photon s energy .",
    "it is clearly visible that at high photon energies the wolf algorithm tends to split clusters stemming from one photon into several photon candidates .",
    "therefore we apply a merging procedure to neighboring photon candidates , after which the fully reconstructed photon energy distribution is practicaly identical to the cheated spectrum shown in the right hand plot of figure  [ fig : egamma ] .    the energy resolution obtained after the recombination procedure is shown in right plot of figure  [ fig : ncluseres ] as a function of @xmath27 . with being roughly constant at about @xmath28",
    ", it seems to be significantly worse than the @xmath29 aimed for at the ilc .",
    "this effect has been meanwhile tracked down to an imperfect calibration , which means that the results presented in the next section are expected to improve further once a better calibration procedure is applied .",

    "currently , the following scenarios have been investigated :    * wimp spin : p - wave annihilation ( j=1 ) for @xmath30 and @xmath31 * wimp couplings : @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 * polarisation : unpolarised beams , @xmath35 polarisation only ( @xmath36 ) and additional @xmath37 polarisation ( @xmath36 and @xmath38 ) .      for each combination of these parameters ,",

    "both the range in phase space as well as the mass resolution improve significantly when polarised beams are assumed .",
    "typically the use of 80% electron polarisation gives improvements of a factor of two over unpolarised beams , whereas an additional positron polarisation of 60% yields another factor of two .",
    "the results presented here will be improved in the near future by applying a more appropriate detector calibration and by using other particle flow algorithms and photon finders .",
    "furthermore reducible backgrounds as well as beamstrahlung have to be included in the study , before finally different detector concepts can be compared .",
