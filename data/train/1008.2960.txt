    "large scale near infrared ( nir ) and optical surveys such as the 2-micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) are aiding the identification of a rapidly increasing number of @xmath6field@xmath6 brown dwarfs ( bds ) ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , as well as probing down into new cooler temperature regimes ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in general the estimation of properties of these bds ( e.g. age , mass , metallicity ) currently relies on model fitting .",
    "however , the models are very sensitive to a variety of poorly understood processes in bd atmospheres , such as the formation of dust condensates @xcite and non - equilibrium chemistry @xcite , and the spectroscopic fitting of atmospheric properties ( @xmath0 , @xmath4 , [ m / h ] ) is a major challenge .",
    "crucially , the nature of bd evolution means that the mass - luminosity relation depends strongly on age , and in the absence of well constrained atmospheric properties there is no way to accurately determine mass and age .",
    "identifying objects where one can pin down these properties independently can help aid the calibration of models .",
    "bds that are members of binaries , where the primary member has age constraints are good sources of benchmark bds ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular white dwarf primaries can provide a hard lower limit on the age of the system ( from the white dwarf cooling age ) and in the case of high mass white dwarfs ( where the main sequence progenitor star will have a short lifetime and the age will thus be essentially the same as the cooling age of the white dwarf ) , could provide ages constrained at the 10% level ( @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "binary systems containing a white dwarf and a bd however are observationally rare , and only a handful of such binaries have been identified . to date",
    "there are only five l dwarf + white dwarf systems that have been spectroscopically confirmed , gd 165b ( l4 ; @xcite ) , gd 1400 ( l6/7 ; @xcite , @xcite ) , wd@xmath7 ( l8 ; @xcite , @xcite ) , pg1234 + 482 ( l0 ; @xcite , @xcite ) and phl 5038b ( l8 ; @xcite ) previously the latest type bd companion to a white dwarf .",
    "there have also been several bd companions to white dwarfs found as cataclysmic variable systems ( cvs , e.g. @xcite ) , although the nature of such objects means that they my be less useful in the context of studies of typical bd atmospheres .",
    "we present here results from our ongoing search to identify widely separated bd companions to white dwarfs , expanding on our earlier searches of 2mass and supercosmos ( @xcite ) , to include the first results from our combined search of ukidss and supercosmos .",
    "we present here the discovery of the first t dwarf + white dwarf binary system , which we confirm through common proper motion and spectroscopy .    in section [ ukidss ]",
    "we describe the ongoing search to identify and spectroscopically confirm late t dwarfs in the ukidss large area survey ( las ) . in section [ pms ]",
    "we describe our proper motion measurements of these confirmed t dwarfs and our techniques to search for binary companions to these objects . in section [ wdspec ]",
    "we describe the spectroscopy of a white dwarf candidate companion and the resulting constraints on its properties . in section [ stats ]",
    "we statistically assess the likelihood that our new t dwarf + white dwarf binary system is spurious .",
    "section [ tproperties ] determines constraints for the atmospheric properties of the t dwarf , taking advantage of its benchmark age constraints ( from the white dwarf primary ) .",
    "we also perform some basic spectral model fits to the t dwarf spectrum , and compare the resulting predictions .",
    "finally in section [ concs ] we conclude with further discussion of the system as a useful benchmark and comment on the direction of future work .",
    "the ukidss las has been searched for t dwarfs using selection techniques based on the observed ukidss+sdss colours of previously identified t dwarfs , as well as theoretical predictions for the cooler @xmath0= 400 - 700k regime .",
    "the selection techniques used to identify these t dwarfs are described in detail in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider t dwarfs that were spectroscopically confirmed ( burningham private comm . ) by the summer of 2008 ( see @xcite and a sub - sample of @xcite ) , and the sky coverage appropriate to this sample includes the full las second data release , 72% of the new sky in the third data release , and 66% of the new sky in the fourth data release . in total , this sample was identified in 890 square degrees of las sky .",
    "candidates are followed up in general with additional imaging in the near infrared and/or optical .",
    "this allows confirmation of the expected t - like colours and rules out various forms of contamination ( e.g. faint m dwarfs with low signal - to - noise and blue - ward scattered near - infrared colours due to large photometric uncertainty , as well as solar system objects that can appear as non detections due to their motion ) .",
    "this followup has been performed using a variety of telescope / instruments , including the wide field camera ( wfcam ) and fast track imager ( ufti ) on ukirt , and the long - slit intermediate resolution infrared spectrograph ( liris ) on the william herschel telescope ( wht ) ( all near infrared ) , as well as the eso multi - mode instrument ( emmi ) and the eso faint object spectrograph and camera ( efosc2 ) on the new technology telescope ( optical ) .",
    "spectroscopic confirmation of the las candidates was also achieved using a number of facilities , including the near infrared camera and spectrograph ( niri ) and the gemini near infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) on the gemini telescopes , and the infrared camera spectrograph ( ircs ) on subaru .",
    "the near infrared camera spectrograph ( nics ) on the telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) and the ukirt imager spectrograph ( uist ) were also used for the brighter t dwarfs .",
    "details of the follow - up imaging and spectroscopic strategies , as well as the relevant reduction and calibration techniques used are further discussed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "corresponding spectral types were derived using the unified t dwarf classification scheme of @xcite with an extension from @xcite for the latest types .",
    "t dwarf distances have been estimated using the absolute magnitude - spectral type relations from @xcite , assuming the t dwarfs are single objects .",
    "we calculated m@xmath8 , choosing the @xmath9 band magnitude over the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands , as models have suggested that the @xmath9 band may be less sensitive to variations in metallicity and gravity than the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the distance were obtained by taking into account the error in the spectral type ( typically @xmath10.5 ) and the residuals of the polynomial fits from @xcite .",
    "[ tdspt ] shows the spectral type distance distribution for the spectroscopically confirmed sample of 49 t dwarfs that we consider in this work .",
    "it can be seen that the sample spans the spectral type and distance range t2 - 9 and 12 - 80pc .",
    "this is comprised of two t2 - 3 dwarfs , 29 in the t4 - 6 range , sixteen t6 - 8 dwarfs and two t8 + dwarfs . due to the cooler temperatures and thus fainter nature of",
    "later t dwarfs it can be seen that we are more sensitive to earlier t dwarfs out to further distances .",
    "the photometric follow - up program provided second epoch imaging for the las t dwarfs , which we combined with the las images to give two epochs to calculate proper motion .",
    "we used the iraf routines geomap to derive a geometric transformation between the two epoch images , and geoxytran to apply these transforms to the t dwarf positions .",
    "centroiding uncertainties were calculated based on simulated data with appropriate poisson noise injected .",
    "the availability and quality of the measured proper motions of the t dwarfs is dependent on several factors including : the baseline between the epochs , the number of stars that can be used for positional reference in each of the images , the s / n of both the t dwarf and the reference stars , and the proximity of the t dwarfs to the edge of the wfcam detector array ( in the first epoch images ) .",
    "we were able to measure the proper motions of 19 t dwarfs from the 49 strong sample of spectroscopic confirmations that we consider , using an average of 12 reference stars across a baseline of 0.5 - 1.5 years .",
    "a vector - point diagram of the t dwarf proper motions is shown in fig  [ tpms ] , where two t dwarfs found to have common proper motion companions ( see section [ cpm ] ) are highlighted .",
    "we searched for candidate common proper motion companions to our sample of t dwarfs with reliable proper motions , by selecting a magnitude limited sample of supercosmos sources , where r@xmath1221 ( the magnitude limit at which proper motions are measured ) and have accurately measured proper motions such that pm/@xmath133 .",
    "we searched around each of the 19 t dwarfs out to an angular separation corresponding to 20,000au , at the estimated minimum distance of each t dwarf .",
    "we choose a separation limit of 20,000au in order to be sensitive to the detection of both widely separated main - sequence ( ms ) and white dwarf ( wd ) companions .",
    "it is fairly common to find bd+main - sequence star binaries with separations of @xmath25000au ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however a white dwarf companion could have even wider separations , when one considers any outward migration that would have occurred during the post - main - sequence mass - loss phase .",
    "we suggest that the outward migration would likely be up to a factor of @xmath24 , as the initial and final separation of a low mass binary companion is directly related to the change in mass of the host star i.e. @xmath14/@xmath15 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . to illustrate this we consider a white dwarf of mass @xmath20.65m@xmath16 ( roughly the mean of the white dwarf mass distribution ) .",
    "the progenitor mass would be @xmath22.7m@xmath16 ( from the initial - final mass relations of @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , such that m@xmath17/m@xmath18 @xmath2 4 .",
    "thus , for bd + main - sequence binaries separated by @xmath25000au , we could expect their final separation to be up to @xmath2 20,000au .    for each common proper motion companion candidate",
    ", we assumed a distance that was the same as the estimated distance of the relevant t dwarf , and thus placed companion candidates on an absolute b magnitude ( m@xmath19 ) vs @xmath20 colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "their positions were compared with those expected for main - sequence stars and white dwarfs , following the approaches described in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we then compared their sdss colours with respect to stellar populations , including main - sequence stars ( hipparcos ; @xcite ) , m dwarfs @xcite , k subdwarfs @xcite and white dwarfs ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we found that only one main - sequence companion candidate was identified , wolf940 which had previously been identified serendipitously by @xcite and will not be discussed further .",
    "we also identified five candidate white dwarf companions to the t dwarfs in our sample , that are common proper motion ( to within the uncertainties ) and are consistent with the white dwarf sequence ( see fig .",
    "[ wdcmd ] and [ wd2col ] ) if assumed to be at the same distance as their t dwarf companions .",
    "the brightest of our white dwarf candidates appears in the lspm catalogue ( lspm j1459 + 0851 , @xcite ) as a high proper motion object , although it has not been previously studied spectroscopically . the t dwarf associated with this object is ulasj1459 + 0857 , which has been spectroscopically typed as a t4.5@xmath10.5 dwarf @xcite .",
    "this pair is highlighted in fig .",
    "[ wdcmd ] and [ wd2col ] .              to assess the possibility that our candidate white dwarf companions may be dominated by high velocity background objects , such as metal - poor , halo k - subdwarfs ( which could populate the same colour and proper motion space that we search in this work ) , we have derived space motion estimates assuming that our candidates are k subdwarfs .",
    "we used the relations of @xcite to estimate an absolute r@xmath6 magnitude ( m@xmath21 ) from g@xmath6-i@xmath6 colour , for a metallicity range ( for sub - dwarfs ) of @xmath220.5 and @xmath222.5 , and thus obtained distance constraints applicable if these objects are sub - dwarfs .",
    "assuming for simplicity that they have a zero radial velocity , we then estimated space motions to assess potential halo membership",
    ". all except one candidate would have space motions of 2,000 - 12,000  kms@xmath23 , which are thus not consistent with a galactic halo population .",
    "the exception is close enough such that its kinematics are consistent with a background sub - dwarf member .",
    "indeed this is one of the widest separated candidates ( 400 arcsec ) , and the level of background contamination for such separation ( and volume ) approaches 1 , even for the low density halo luminosity function @xcite . however , despite one possible halo contaminant , the majority of the candidates can not be explained by such contamination .    a more likely source of error potentially leading to misidentification amongst the candidates is proper motion uncertainty , since the ratio of proper motion to proper motion uncertainty for some of the candidates is in the 3 - 5 range , and one would thus expect that some fraction of the sample have proper motions that have scattered to larger values .",
    "given this likely source of contamination we choose not to present details of all five of our companion candidates at this stage .",
    "we prefer to first establish their nature through spectroscopic study , and in that way confirm them ( or otherwise ) as genuine white dwarf companions .",
    "we have so far only obtained good spectroscopy for both components of the binary containing j1459 + 0851 and thus focus the remainder of this paper on this one system .",
    "spectroscopic observations of lspm j@xmath24 were obtained with fors2 on the very large telescope on 2009 may 15 and 21 , with directors discretionary time in program 282.c-5069(a ) .",
    "we used the long slit mode in the optical wavelength range 3300 - 8000  with a dispersion of 50 and 55 / mm respectively , for the ranges 3300 - 6210  ( corresponding to the b grism ) and 5120 - 8450  ( corresponding to the ri grism ) , giving a resolution of r@xmath21200 .",
    "three integrations of 600s were taken , giving a total exposure time of 30  minutes for the b grism and two integrations of 360s , totaling 12  minutes in the ri grism .",
    "sky flats , arc frames and the spectra of a dc white dwarf as well as a standard f - type star and da white dwarf were taken during the same night at a similar airmass to the target so as to provide wavelength , flux and telluric calibrations .",
    "standard iraf routines were used to reduce the spectra including flat fielding and cosmic ray removal .",
    "the spectra were extracted with apall , using a chebyshev function to fit the background and a third order legendre function to trace the fit to the spectrum .",
    "the wavelength calibration was done using the spectrum from hgcdhear and hgcdhenear arc lamps for the b and ri grisms respectively , and using identify to reference the arc lines , along with the dispcor routine to correct the dispersion of the spectrum .",
    "the resulting spectra of both lspm j@xmath24 and the standard were divided by the smooth spectrum of the dc white dwarf , which has no intrinsic spectral features , enabling correction for the instrumental response .",
    "the standard stars ( one for each grism ) were then used to flux calibrate the spectrum .",
    "the two spectra were then stitched together in the overlapping sections and normalised at 6000 .",
    "the final spectrum of lspm j@xmath24 is shown in fig .",
    "[ wdspecplot ] .",
    "it can be seen that some residual tellurics remain and are highlighted for reference .",
    "they do not however affect the subsequent analysis in any way , since they do not overlap with features used directly to assess white dwarf properties .",
    "the general spectral shape is quite blackbody - like , consistent with a white dwarf or perhaps a very metal poor sub - dwarf ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however the overall strength of the h@xmath25 line and the peak of the blackbody - like continuum are only consistent with a relatively cool example of a white dwarf ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also compare lspm j@xmath24 to the spectra of three other very cool , hydrogen rich ( da ) white dwarfs , wd0011 - 134 , wd 1330 + 015 and wd 0503 - 174 , taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they have corresponding @xmath0 s of 6000@xmath1150k , 7450@xmath1200k and 5230@xmath1140k respectively , and are shown in fig .",
    "although the spectra of lspm j@xmath24 are noisier , it can be seen that the extent of the h@xmath25 feature is consistent with a cool , hydrogen rich white dwarf .",
    "we further assess its properties in more detail in the following sections .",
    "as previously noted , the spectrum shows a lack of strong h lines , which would be expected for a hotter more typical white dwarf .",
    "photometric fitting of the full optical - nir sed is thus optimal for determining the effective temperature of the white dwarf , using model fits to the sdss+ukidss photometry and assuming a distance equal to that of the t dwarf companion .",
    "the spectra are consistent with a cool white dwarf , showing no strong features in the spectrum blue - ward of 6000  and just a hint of h@xmath25 .",
    "we performed a fit to the available photometry of the white dwarf ( from sdss , usno and ukidss ) using the atmospheric model codes of bergeron et al .",
    ", which are described at length in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* with updates given in @xcite ) .",
    "these models assume local thermodynamic equilibrium and allow energy transport by convection and can be calculated with arbitrary amounts of hydrogen and helium .",
    "synthetic colorsbergeron / coolingmodels/ ] were obtained using the procedure outlined in @xcite based on the vega fluxes taken from @xcite .    the method used to fit the photometric data is similar to that described in @xcite , which we briefly summarize here .",
    "we first transform the magnitudes in each bandpass into observed average fluxes @xmath26 using the following equation    @xmath27    where    @xmath28    the transmission functions @xmath29 along with the constants @xmath30 for each bandpass are described in @xcite and references therein .",
    "to make use of all the photometric measurements simultaneously , we convert the magnitudes into observed fluxes using equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) and compare the resulting energy distributions with those predicted from our model atmosphere calculations .",
    "thus , we obtain a set of average fluxes @xmath26 , which can now be compared with the model fluxes .",
    "these model fluxes are also averaged over the filter bandpasses by substituting @xmath31 in equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) for the monochromatic eddington flux @xmath32 .",
    "the average observed fluxes @xmath26 and model fluxes @xmath33 , which depend on @xmath0 , @xmath4 and @xmath34(he)/@xmath34(h ) , are related by the equation    @xmath35    where r / d is the ratio of the radius of the star to its distance from earth .",
    "our fitting procedure relies on the nonlinear least - squares method of levenberg - marquardt , which is based on a steepest descent method .",
    "the value of @xmath36 is taken as the sum over all bandpasses of the difference between both sides of equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) , properly weighted by the corresponding observational uncertainties . in our fitting procedure , we consider only @xmath37 and the solid angle free parameters .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the energy distributions are not sensitive enough to surface gravity to constrain the value of @xmath4 , and thus for white dwarfs with no parallax measurement , as is the case here , we simply assume @xmath4 = 8.0 , which is consistent with the distance estimate of the t dwarf companion .",
    "our best fit for a pure - h atmosphere arises from a @xmath0 = 5535@xmath145k , and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : f1 ] .",
    "the shape and weakness of the h@xmath25 line gives a poor fit to a basic 5535k model spectra , and we thus investigated the possibility that the white dwarf could be magnetic with the h@xmath25 line affected by zeeman splitting .",
    "the line opacity was calculated as the sum of the individual resonance - broadened zeeman components .",
    "the line displacements and strengths of the zeeman components of h@xmath25 are taken from the tables of @xcite , and the total line opacity is normalised to that resulting from the zero - field solution .",
    "the specific intensities at the surface , @xmath38 , are obtained by solving the radiative transfer equation for various field strengths and values of @xmath39 ( @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the angle between the angle of propagation of light and the normal to the surface of the star ) . in doing so",
    ", the polarization of the radiation is neglected as we are mainly interested in the total monochromatic intensity .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field on the continuum opacity is also neglected .",
    "the emergent spectrum is then obtained from an integration over the surface of the star ( @xmath42 ) for a particular geometry of the magnetic field distribution .",
    "we note that in this procedure , limb darkening is explicitly taken into account because of the integration over @xmath39 .",
    "we use the offset dipole model to model the magnetic field of the white dwarf @xcite . in this model , the magnetic field is generated by a dipole . at the surface of the star ( of radius unity ) , the strength of the magnetic field is simply given by    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the dipole field strength , and @xmath41 is the standard angle in spherical coordinates ( @xmath41 = 0 at the pole ) . for a given value of @xmath44 , the flux received at the earth will also depend on the viewing angle @xmath45 between the dipole axis and the line of sight ( @xmath45 = 0 for a pole - on view ) .",
    "however , in this particular model , the dipole is also offset from the center of the star in an arbitrary direction . to simplify the calculation",
    ", we assume the dipole is offset parallel to the dipole axis . in this case",
    ", the value of the offset is measured from the center of the star and is denoted @xmath46 ( in units of stellar radius ) .",
    "note that with the offset dipole models , the value of the dipole field strength , @xmath44 , is no longer equal to the value of the polar field strength .",
    "we computed a series of synthetic spectra based on a model atmosphere of pure - h with @xmath0 = 5535k and @xmath4 = 8.0 while varying @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ fg : f1 ] the model which best reproduced the observed line profile with @xmath44 = 2.0 mg , @xmath45 = 45@xmath47 and @xmath46 = @xmath220.20 .",
    "it should be noted that varying the inclination angle @xmath45 produced only slight variations in the line profiles and as stated in @xcite , it is not possible to constrain @xmath45 from observed line profiles alone .",
    "the zeeman - split h@xmath25 line in lspm j@xmath24 can be compared to the same feature in other cool white dwarfs of higher magnetic field strengths in fig  [ wdha ] .",
    "we start by considering the simple case of a non - magnetic white dwarf for a @xmath0 and @xmath4 of 5535k and 8.0 , for which we calculate a mass of 0.585m@xmath48 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding cooling age of a 0.585m@xmath48 white dwarf , with a @xmath0= 5535k was then calculated as 3gyr using the isochrones of @xcite .",
    "the total age of the white dwarf comprises of both the cooling time and its progenitor lifetime on the main - sequence .",
    "in order to constrain the main - sequence lifetime we accessed the initial - final mass relations of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to estimate a likely , initial - mass constraint for the main - sequence progenitor star of 1.50 - 1.75m@xmath48 .",
    "we then used the tracks of @xcite to estimate the main - sequence lifetime for stars of such mass as 1.8 - 3.0gyrs .",
    "it should be noted however that the model tracks converge for masses @xmath122m@xmath48 , and as a result the ages of these objects can be largely uncertain ( up to 10gyr ) .",
    "the strong magnetic field present also provides an additional factor to consider when assessing age .",
    "the origin of such strong white dwarf magnetic fields is not fully understood but is thought to have arisen in one of two favored scenarios :    _ 1 .",
    "_ from a single star .",
    "the magnetic field is thought to derive from a massive , magnetic progenitor of @xmath21.5 - 8m@xmath48 , typically an ap or bp star .",
    "the magnetic field is then maintained through the main - sequence evolution to the white dwarf phase by flux conservation ( @xcite ) .",
    "_ from the merger of two stellar cores in a common envelope event or the merger of two degenerate objects . during the common envelope ( ce ) phase the orbits of the two cores spiral in closer together through frictional forces causing differential rotation , which coupled with convection in the cores ,",
    "creates a stellar - magnetic dynamo ( @xcite ) .",
    "close , but separated cores form cvs but some cores coalesce and cool to form a magnetic white dwarf",
    ". it may also be possible that two very close white dwarfs emerge from the ce phase , such as g62 - 46 ( @xcite ) , where one component is highly magnetic .",
    "in general it is observed that magnetic white dwarfs have larger masses than the more typical non - magnetic white dwarfs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are two possible hypothesis to explain this .",
    "firstly , in accordance with the favoured scenario for the formation of isolated magnetic white dwarfs ( @xcite ) , the progenitor was more massive , leading to a massive white dwarf .",
    "in this case the magnetic field has no effect during the progenitor evolution .",
    "secondly the effect of the magnetic field has an impact on the stellar evolution , such that it could inhibit mass loss ( @xcite ) , leading to a more massive core and a longer progenitor lifetime . if we consider the possibility that our white dwarf could be of higher mass , for example 0.8m@xmath48 ( the mean mass of a highly magnetic white dwarf ; @xcite ) then the cooling time would be longer , around 6gyrs ( @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the progenitor ( if a single star ) would be around 3.5m@xmath48 ( @xcite ) and the progenitor main - sequence lifetime would be 0.3gyr ( assuming normal models )",
    ". however there is also evidence that many magnetic white dwarfs have masses closer to the peak of the non - magnetic mass distribution ( @xcite ) .    as we can not know which scenario is responsible for the observed magnetic field , nor",
    "can we measure more accurately the mass of the white dwarf , we do not know the effects this may have had on the main - sequence evolution . in any case both scenarios for a magnetic and a non - magnetic white dwarf results in ages greater than 4.8gyrs ( the cooling age plus the minimum progenitor lifetime of a non - magnetic white dwarf ) and we thus choose to adopt this as the minimum total age for lspm j@xmath24 .",

    "we then used the number density of white dwarfs ( e.g. @xcite ) to estimate that we would expect only 0.00368 white dwarfs in this volume of space .    to factor in the probability that two objects might have a common proper motion at the level of our measurements , we downloaded a magnitude - limited sample ( @xmath55@xmath1221 , the same as our initial selection ; see section [ cpm ] ) of objects from the supercosmos science archive .",
    "we applied a limit to the proper motion uncertainty of @xmath1250mas / yr and required objects to lie in the colour range 1@xmath643 ( where we expect contaminant , main - sequence stars ) .",
    "this sample of 10,360 sources was selected from within one degree of the t dwarf as to provide a representative sample of objects in the area of sky in which we find our binary system .",
    "we then placed these objects on a colour - magnitude diagram and selected only objects that occupied a region populated by main - sequence stars , when placed at the distance range estimated for the t dwarf .",
    "of the 140 objects that were selected in this way , 13 had proper motion consistent ( at the 1@xmath65 level ) with the t dwarf , leading to a probability of 0.092 , that a contaminant star could have proper motion common with the t dwarf .",
    "the chance of finding a white dwarf with the same line - of - sight separation of lspmj1459 + 851 from ulasj1459 + 0857 , where both components share a common proper motion and are consistent with lying at the same distance as that estimated for the t dwarf is thus 0.00368 x 0.092 = 0.0003 .",
    "we thus conclude that these objects form a genuine binary system . since we searched for companions to a total of 19 t dwarfs",

    "indeed we expect that the initial separation of the two components was a factor of @xmath24 closer ( see section [ cpm ] ) , in the region of@xmath24100au and more akin to the more common type of bd+main sequence binaries ( @xmath125000au ; @xcite ) .",

    "the main source of uncertainty in these @xmath0 values comes from a lack of strong age constraints and the resulting evolutionary model radii uncertainties ( up to @xmath230% for ages @xmath30.1 gyrs ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . by considering the variety of @xmath0 ranges calculated for the t4.5@xmath10.5 dwarfs which have assumed a range of possible ages from 0.1 - 10gyrs ( @xmath69300k )",

    "we calculated absolute magnitudes for ulasj1459 + 0857 based on this distance range for ages 4 - 10gyrs .",

    ", we only use these @xmath73@xmath74 values as an additional quality indicator for the over - all model - observation comparison .",

    "<S> we present the discovery of the first t dwarf + white dwarf binary system lspm1459 + 0857ab , confirmed through common proper motion and spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the white dwarf is a high proper motion object from the lspm catalogue that we confirm spectroscopically to be a relatively cool ( @xmath0 = 5535@xmath145k ) and magnetic ( b@xmath22 mg ) hydrogen - rich white dwarf , with an age of at least 4.8gyrs . </S>",
    "<S> the t dwarf is a recent discovery from the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ulas1459 + 0857 ) , and has a spectral type of t4.5@xmath10.5 and a distance in the range 43 - 69pc . with an age constraint ( inferred from the white dwarf ) of @xmath34.8gyrs </S>",
    "<S> we estimate @xmath0 = 1200 - 1500k and @xmath4 = 5.4 - 5.5 for ulas1459 + 0857 , making it a benchmark t dwarf with well constrained surface gravity . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the t dwarf spectra with the latest lyon group atmospheric model predictions , which despite some shortcomings are in general agreement with the observed properties of ulas1459 + 0857 . </S>",
    "<S> the separation of the binary components ( 16,500 - 26,500au , or 365 arcseconds on the sky ) is consistent with an evolved version of the more common brown dwarf + main - sequence binary systems now known , and although the system has a wide separation , it is shown to be statistically robust as a non spurious association . </S>",
    "<S> the observed colours of the t dwarf show that it is relatively bright in the @xmath5 band compared to other t dwarfs of similar type , and further investigation is warranted to explore the possibility that this could be a more generic indicator of older t dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> future observations of this binary system will provide even stronger constraints on the t dwarf properties , and additional systems will combine to give a more comprehensively robust test of the model atmospheres in this temperature regime .    </S>",
