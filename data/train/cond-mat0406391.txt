    "agent - based models form an important part of research on complex adaptive systems @xcite .",
    "for example , the self - organization of an evolving population consisting of agents competing for a limited resource has potential applications in areas such as economics , biology , engineering , and social sciences @xcite .",
    "the bar - attendance problem proposed by arthur @xcite constitutes a typical setting of such a system in which a population of agents decide whether to go to a popular bar having limited seating capacity .",
    "the agents are informed of the attendance in past weeks , and hence the agents share common information , interact through their actions , and learn from past experience . the problem can be simplified by considering binary games , either in the form of the minority game ( mg ) @xcite or in a binary - agent - resource ( b - a - r ) game @xcite . for modest resource levels in which there are more losers than winners , the minority game proposed by challet and zhang @xcite represents a simple , yet non - trival , model that captures many of the essential features of such a competing population .",
    "the mg considers an odd number @xmath2 of agents . at each time step",
    ", the agents independently decide between two options ` @xmath3 ' and ` @xmath4 ' .",
    "the winners are those who choose the minority option .",
    "the agents learn from past experience by evaluating the performance of their strategies , where each strategy maps the available global information ( i.e. , the record of the most recent @xmath5 winning options ) to an action .",
    "one important quantity in mg is the standard deviation @xmath6 of the number of agents making a particular choice .",
    "this quantity reflects the performance of the population as a whole in that a small @xmath6 implies on average more winners per turn , and hence a higher success rate per turn per agent . in the mg",
    ", @xmath6 exhibits a non - monotonic dependence on the memory size @xmath5 of the agents @xcite .",
    "when @xmath5 is small , there is significant overlap between the agents strategies .",
    "this crowd effect @xcite leads to a large @xmath6 , implying the number of losers is high .",
    "this is the crowded , or informationally efficient , phase of mg . in the informationally inefficient phase where @xmath5 is large",
    ", @xmath6 is moderately small and the agents perform better than if they were to decide their actions randomly .",
    "theoretical analysis of the mg has been the focus of many studies @xcite .",
    "mapping the mg into the language of disordered spin systems makes the machinery in statistical physics of disordered system , most noticeably the replica trick , useful in the study of models of competing population . for the mg , calculations based on the replica method work well for the case of large strategy pool , i.e. , when the strategy pool is much larger than the strategies actually being used in making decisions",
    "this is referred to as the informationally inefficient phase because information is left in the resulting bit - string patterns for a single realization of the game . in the informationally efficient phase ,",
    "the whole pool of strategies tend to be in play during the game .",
    "the crowd - anticrowd theory gives a physically transparent quantitative theory of the observed features in this regime , as well as in the inefficient regime .",
    "the crowd - anticrowd theory is based on the fact that it is the difference in the numbers of agents playing a strategy @xmath7 and the corresponding anti - correlated strategy @xmath8 that plays the most important role in the understanding of the fluctuations and hence performance of the whole population .",
    "the crowd - anticrowd theory is a microscopic approach in the sense that it follows the strategy play of the agents in the population . while this leads to microscopically correct equations , in practice these equations",
    "are evaluated by simply time - averaging over the path taken by the strategy rankings .",
    "a naive time - averaging over all histories becomes more difficult to implement as the number of ties in strategy scores increases , since such ties affect the number of agents playing a given ranking of strategy and hence must be incorporated explicitly in the time - average .",
    "the effect of strategy ties becomes increasingly important as @xmath5 decreases , i.e. , size of strategy space decreases , since the chance of ties arising will then increase . in the efficient phase at low @xmath5 ,",
    "therefore , there are frequent ties in the strategy performance @xcite , and hence the time - averagings within the crowd - anticrowd theory require special care . in the present paper ,",
    "we present a complementary theoretical treatment for this regime in order to explicitly account for such strategy ties .",
    "the resulting theory amounts to a non - trivial reorganization of the time - averagings within the crowd - anticrowd theory . like the original crowd - anticrowd theory , it is applicable to both non - networked and networked populations @xcite .",
    "the theory we present is based on the idea of following the patterns of the ranking of strategies as the game evolves in time , without knowing the details on the ranking of each strategy .",
    "the effects of tied strategies are taken into account by considering the number of strategies belonging to each rank as the game evolves . to illustrate the applications of the theory , we show that the theory explains the features observed in numerical results of a networked version of mg .",
    "the theory also allows the evaluation of the success rate of agents with a given number of connected neighbors .",
    "the latter is important in the study of the functionality of an underlying network @xcite in a competing population .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we define the mg in non - networked and networked populations . in sec.iii",
    ", we discuss the different ranking patterns based on performance of the strategies as the game evolves , and the fraction of strategies in each rank .",
    "the number of agents using a strategy belonging to a particular rank , is derived for both non - networked and networked mg in section iv . in sec.v",
    ", we apply the theory to derive an expression for the mean success rate in the efficient phase as a function of the connectivity in the population and compare results with those obtained by numerical simulations . an alternative way to study",
    "the mean success rate is to decompose the population into agents with different numbers of connected neighbors .",
    "an expression for the mean success rate of agents with @xmath0 connected neighbors is derived in sec.vi .",
    "results are in agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "section vii gives a discussion on the limit of validity of the theory and shows that the theory can be extended to study b - a - r models at high connectivity .",
    "the basic mg @xcite comprises of @xmath2 agents competing to be in a minority group at each time step .",
    "the only information available to the agents is the history .",
    "the history is a bit - string of length @xmath5 recording the minority option for the most recent @xmath5 timesteps .",
    "there are a total of @xmath9 possible history bit - strings .",
    "for example , @xmath10 has @xmath11 possible global outcome histories : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . at the beginning of the game",
    ", each agent picks @xmath16 strategies , with repetition allowed .",
    "they make their decisions based on their strategies .",
    "a strategy is a look up table with @xmath9 entries giving the predictions for all possible history bit - strings .",
    "since each entry can either be ` 0 ' or ` 1 ' , the full strategy pool contains @xmath17 strategies .",
    "adaptation is built in by allowing the agents to accumulate a merit ( virtual ) point for each of her strategies as the game proceeds , with the initial merit points set to zero for all strategies .",
    "strategies that predicted the winning ( losing ) action at a given timestep , are assigned ( deducted ) one ( virtual ) point . at each turn",
    ", the agent follows the prediction of her best - scoring strategy .",
    "a random choice will be made for tied strategies .    the networked minority game @xcite explores the _ functionality _ of an underlying network in the context of a population competing for limited resource .",
    "at each timestep @xmath18 , each agent ( node ) decides on one or two options , as in the basic mg .",
    "each agent decides in light of ( i ) _ global information _ which takes the form of the history of the @xmath5 most recent global outcomes as in the basic mg , and ( ii ) _ local information _ obtained via network connections .",
    "the connections here need not be physical  it only matters that the connected neighbors are those with whom an agent can communicate .",
    "adaptation is introduced by randomly assigning @xmath16 strategies to each agent . at each timestep , each agent compares the score of its own best - scoring strategy ( or strategies ) with the highest - scoring strategy ( or strategies ) among the agents to whom he is connected .",
    "the agent adopts the action of whichever strategy is highest - scoring overall , using a coin - toss to break any ties .",
    "the network can be a classical random network or take on the geometry of a growing scale - free network @xcite . for simplicity , we here assume a random network , where the connection between any two agents ( i.e. , nodes ) exists with a probability @xmath1 . numerical results @xcite show that the presence of connections lowers the global performance of the population , while ensuring fairness by lowering the spread in the success rates among the agents . here",
    ", we aim at formulating a theory that can be applied to explain the features observed in the numerical simulations .",
    "since the effect of such connections is typically to increase the chances of strategy ties , particularly at low @xmath5 , this motivates the present theory s approach of tracking strategy patterns in time .",
    "the two key ingredients for the present theory are ( i ) the patterns of strategy rankings according to performance , based on the strategies virtual points as the game proceeds ; and ( ii ) the fraction of strategies in each rank for each ranking pattern . in the following two subsections ,",
    "we discuss these two points .",
    "the discussion is valid for populations either with or without connections .",
    "as a particular run of a given game evolves , the pattern of strategy rankings also evolves . the instantaneous strategy ranking depends on the number of history bit - strings that have occurred an _ odd _ number of times and the next outcome will depend on whether the current history bit - string has occurred an odd or even number of times .",
    "both of these factors are important in the calculation of the mean success rate of the population .",
    "suppose we are at a given moment in the run of a game .",
    "let @xmath19 be the current history bit - string that the agents are using for decisions .",
    "let @xmath20 be the set of turns ( i.e. , timesteps ) so far in which a history @xmath21 has occurred an odd number of times ( including the initial history bit - string that starts the game ) while @xmath22 is the set of turns so far in which a history @xmath21 has occurred an even number of times @xcite . for small values of @xmath5 ,",
    "i.e. in the efficient phase of the mg , the outcome time series exhibits the feature of anti - persistence or double periodicity @xcite .",
    "this feature implies that all history bit - strings occur with equal probabilities .",
    "it means that for a current history @xmath19 based on which that the agents decide , if the winning side is @xmath23 ( @xmath23 can be @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) when @xmath24 , the outcome is @xmath25 with probability unity in the next occurrence of @xmath19 .",
    "this follows that no strategies could perform better than the others in an average over time , and the virtual points ( vp ) of the strategies can not show a runaway behavior , i.e. , the vps of strategies will not keep on increasing or decreasing .",
    "this property is intimately related to the fact that the eulerian trail is an underlying quasi - attractor of the game in this efficient regime @xcite . by focusing on whether a history has occurred an odd or even number of times during a run , we are picking out what is essentially the most important aspect of the outcome series .    for a particular turn @xmath18",
    ", we define the ranking of the strategies according to their performance up to that point in time based on the vps of the strategies . the rank-@xmath4 strategy or strategies",
    "have the highest vps .",
    "the rank-@xmath26 strategies are the second best - performing ( having the second highest vps ) , and so on . for small @xmath5 ( efficient phase ) ,",
    "the ranking pattern of the strategies depends on _ the number of histories _ that have occurred an odd number of times .",
    "it is illustrative to consider an example for the case of @xmath10 where there are @xmath27 possible histories ( @xmath12 ) , ( @xmath13 ) , ( @xmath14 ) , ( @xmath15 ) . at @xmath28 ,",
    "all strategies are assigned the same vp .",
    "there is only one rank , called rank-@xmath4 , of the strategies , with all the strategies belonging to this rank .",
    "this is also the case when the system returns to a situation equivalent to @xmath28 after visiting every possible path from one history to another an equal number of times . at @xmath29 ,",
    "let @xmath12 be the corresponding history ( without loss of generality , the random seed history is taken to be @xmath12 ) .",
    "the agents decide in a random fashion as the history has not occurred before ( or has occurred an even number of times before ) .",
    "the outcome would be @xmath4 ( or @xmath3 ) with probability @xmath30 .",
    "let the outcome be @xmath4 , for example .",
    "the history bit - string will become @xmath31 .",
    "prior to the current @xmath10 bit - string of @xmath13 , one history bit - string ( namely @xmath12 ) occurred once .",
    "the strategies are now divided into @xmath26 ranks with    rank-1:including strategies that predict @xmath4 for history @xmath12",
    "rank-2:including strategies that predict @xmath3 for history @xmath12    the strategy vp pattern thus consists of two ranks corresponding to assigning @xmath32 vp for those strategies in rank-@xmath4 and @xmath33 for those in rank-@xmath26 .",
    "if the outcome is also @xmath4 at @xmath34 , the strategies that predict @xmath4 for the history @xmath13 will have a higher vp .",
    "note that the history bit - string is now @xmath35 .",
    "prior to the current bit - string of @xmath15 , two @xmath10 bit - strings @xmath12 and @xmath13 occurred once .",
    "the strategies will then be divided into three ranks after this timestep with    rank-1 : including strategies that predict @xmath4 for both histories @xmath12 and @xmath13    rank-2 : including strategies that predict @xmath4 for one of the two histories @xmath12 and @xmath13    rank-3 : including strategies that predict @xmath3 for both histories @xmath12 and @xmath13    the strategy vp pattern thus consists of three ranks corresponding to a vp of @xmath36 for those strategies in rank-@xmath4 , @xmath3 for those in rank-@xmath26 , and @xmath37 for those in rank-@xmath38 .",
    "if at some time @xmath18 , the history @xmath13 happens again , i.e. , the history occurred an odd number of times prior to the one under consideration , the outcome will be @xmath3 due to the crowd effect as the outcome was @xmath4 in the last occurrence of the history .",
    "the rank-@xmath4 strategies will lose and the rank-@xmath38 strategies will win . as a result , the ranking of the strategies",
    "are then reduced to two ranks with    rank-1:including strategies that predict @xmath4 for history @xmath12",
    "rank-2:including strategies that predict @xmath3 for history @xmath12    it is important to note that for a given @xmath5 in the efficient phase , there are only a _ finite number of patterns _ for the ranking of the strategies performance . in general , we have the following result for the strategy performance ranking pattern .    _",
    "if a number of _ @xmath39 _ _  histories occurred an odd number of times , the strategies will be divided into _ _",
    "@xmath40 _ _  ranks__. the ranking is as follows :    rank-1:including strategies that predicted the correct outcome for all @xmath39 histories concerned    rank-2:including strategies that predicted the correct outcome for @xmath41 histories concerned    ...",
    "rank-@xmath42:including strategies that predicted the correct outcomes for @xmath43 histories concerned    ..    rank-@xmath40:including strategies that predicted the correct outcome for @xmath3 histories concerned    for a given value of @xmath5 , @xmath44 as there are @xmath9 possible histories . in the efficient phase , while the numbers of occurrence for every history are the same when averaged over a long time , @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) histories may occur an odd number of times in each timestep as the game evolves .",
    "therefore , the current strategy ranking pattern can be characterized by the parameter @xmath45 . for a timestep corresponding to @xmath47 ,",
    "i.e. , all the histories had occurred an even number of times , there is only one rank and all the strategies lie in the same rank since they have tied vps ( zero vps ) . in other words , there is only one ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) way to achieve a ranking pattern that consists only of rank-@xmath4 .",
    "next we deduce the probability @xmath49 of having @xmath45 histories occur an odd number of times , without invoking too much known details of the dynamics . assuming that each history has probability @xmath30 to appear as one that has occurred an odd number of times , then out of a total of @xmath9 history bit - strings , the probability @xmath50 of having @xmath45 histories occur an odd number of times is @xmath51    as the game evolves , the system maps out a path in the history space @xcite .",
    "as the game goes from one history to another , it also makes transitions from one strategy performance ranking pattern to another .",
    "there may be frequent ties in the strategies performance .",
    "a merit of the present approach is that we take explicit account of possible ties in performance among the strategies by grouping them into the same rank .",
    "this is important in the efficient phase where there are frequent tied vps among the strategies .",
    "the fraction of strategies in a particular rank for given value of @xmath45 can be calculated readily .",
    "it turns out that the ratio of the number of strategies in increasing ranks ( recall rank-@xmath4 corresponds to highest vp ) follows the numbers in the pascal triangle .",
    "when all the histories occurred an even number of times , there is only one rank with a fraction unity of strategies , i.e. , all strategies , belonging to the rank . if only one history ( @xmath52 ) occurred an odd number of times , there are two (= @xmath40 ) ranks with half ( fraction @xmath30 ) of the strategies in rank-@xmath4 and the other half ( fraction @xmath30 ) in rank-@xmath26 .",
    "the ratio of the fractions of strategies in the two ranks is @xmath53 .",
    "if two histories ( @xmath54 ) occurred an odd number of times , there are three ( = @xmath40 ) ranks , with a fraction @xmath55 of the strategies in rank-@xmath4 , @xmath30 in rank-@xmath26 , @xmath55 in rank-@xmath38 .",
    "the ratio of the fractions is @xmath56 . for three histories occurring an odd number of times ,",
    "there are four ranks with the ratio of fractions of strategies in the ranks given by @xmath57 , and so on . for @xmath45 histories occurring an odd number of times , the fraction of strategies in rank-@xmath4 is @xmath58 , the fraction of strategies in rank-@xmath26 is @xmath59 , and so on . in general , the fraction of strategies in rank-@xmath60 is @xmath61 , where the denominator comes from @xmath62 .",
    "the ratio of the fractions of strategies in different ranks is thus given by @xmath63 , which are the numbers in the pascal triangle .",
    "consider the case of a non - connected population , i.e. basic mg or @xmath64 in a networked mg .",
    "as an agent uses the best - scoring strategy up to the moment of making decision , he will use the strategy with the lowest rank among the @xmath16 strategies that he was randomly assigned at the beginning of the game .",
    "let @xmath45 be the number of histories that occurred an odd number of times .",
    "it is convenient for later discussions to introduce the probability @xmath65 that an agent holds a strategy with performance _",
    "worse than _ rank-@xmath66 . for an agent using a rank-@xmath4 strategy to decide",
    ", he must possess at least one rank-@xmath4 strategy .",
    "this happens with a probability @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the probability that the agent holds @xmath16 strategies that are all worse than rank-@xmath4 .",

    "hence we have @xmath80 ranks .",
    "the ratio of strategies in these ranks is @xmath81 .",
    "the average number of agents using strategies in each rank in these turns is given by @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "these numbers change with time as the game evolves to timesteps with different values of @xmath45 .",
    "knowing the number of agents using each rank of strategies , it is then possible to evaluate analytically the average number of agents making a particular decision and the mean success rate of the agents , as we shall discuss in later sections .",
    "let @xmath1 be the probability that two randomly chosen agents are connected . for @xmath87 , the agents may decide based on a strategy that they do not hold . as a result ,",
    "the number of agents who actually _ use _ a strategy for decision in a particular rank is , in general , _ not _ equal to the number of agents @xmath88 who _ hold _ a best - scoring strategy belonging to that rank @xcite . the number of agents @xmath89 who decide by using a rank-@xmath60 strategy can formally be expressed as a sum of two terms @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the number of agents who hold a rank-@xmath60 strategy as their best - performing strategy _ and _ are not linked to agents with a better ( hence lower ranking ) performing strategy , and the second term represents all those using a rank-@xmath60 strategy due to the presence of links . writing @xmath92 , @xmath91 is then given by @xmath93 with @xmath69 given by eqs.([eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) . in eq.([eq11 ] ) , @xmath94 is the number of agents who hold a rank-@xmath66 strategy as their best performing strategy , but they use a rank-@xmath60 strategy for deciding because they are linked to agents carrying such a strategy .",
    "note that @xmath95 because an agent will use the best performing strategy among his own strategies and his connected neighbors strategies in our networked mg model . now consider an agent who does not hold a strategy in rank-@xmath60 but",

    "the mean success rate @xmath101 ( or mean wealth ) of the agents is the average number of winners per agent per turn .",
    "this quantity reflects the global performance of the population as a whole .",
    "this quantity is also closely related to the fluctuations ( or standard deviation ) in the number of agents choosing a particular option as the game proceeds .",

    "thus in the networked mg model , while higher connectivity ensures fairness , the efficiency also decreases .",
    "qualitatively , the drop in @xmath101 comes about from the enhanced crowd effect as @xmath1 increases . here",

    "if @xmath107 , the mean number of agents choosing the last winning option of the corresponding history is given by @xmath108 this is because the rank-@xmath60 strategies must have made the correct predictions for @xmath109 out of the @xmath45 histories concerned .",
    "thus , the agents using a rank-@xmath60 strategy have a probability @xmath110 of choosing the previous winning option for the history @xmath19 based on what every agent decides . due to crowd effect , this is also the probability that the agents using a rank-@xmath60 strategy lose .",

    "the present formalism also provides a physically transparent picture for the drop in @xmath131 with @xmath1 . since there is no strategy that outperform others , those instantaneously better performing strategy or strategies have a higher chance of losing in immediate timesteps .",
    "therefore , by forcing the agents to follow the better performing strategy of their connected neighbors actually _ lower _ their mean success rate .",
    "we emphasize that the present formalism is related to the crowd - anticrowd theory @xcite in that the agents using a strategy and those using the corresponding anticorrelated partner , have different success rates given by the term in the last parentheses in eq.([eq14 ] ) since the pair of strategies must belong to different rankings .",

    "numerical results for a high resource level b - a - r model show interesting features as a function of the connectivity @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ figure3 ] shows the dependence on the mean success rate for @xmath153 in a @xmath78 population as a function of @xmath1 . for @xmath154 in a non - connected population ( @xmath64 ) , the system is in a frozen state in the sense that the outcome is persistently @xmath4 , i.e. , the resource is persistently not over - used with @xmath155 winners per turn .",
    "it is observed that as @xmath1 increases , the system moves away from the frozen state @xcite .",
    "a high-@xmath1 limit is eventually reached corresponding to a state of anti - persistence or double periodicity , characterized by an outcome time series with equal probability for the two possible outcomes and a mean success rate slightly lower than @xmath55 .",
    "in particular , it is observed that the value of @xmath1 ( denoted by @xmath156 ) above which the system reaches the high-@xmath1 state , depends sensitively on @xmath5 and increases with @xmath5 .",
    "the present theory can be extended to estimate @xmath156 . to proceed , we propose a criteria that the system is anti - persistent only if @xmath157 for _ all _ @xmath45 .",
    "this can be understood easily since anti - persistence implies that for @xmath113 for the history @xmath19 concerned , the outcome will be opposite to that in the last occurrence of the history .",
    "however , in b - a - r model , for @xmath158 , the winning option in the last occurrence of the history wins again , and the system ceases to be anti - persistence .",
    "we further note that @xmath159 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath45 , with a minimum at @xmath160 when all the possible histories occurred an odd number of times .",
    "this behavior follows from eq.([eq12 ] ) , and we have also checked it against numerical results .    for a given high resource level @xmath149 , as @xmath1 decreases from the high-@xmath1 state , the difference between @xmath159 and @xmath149 drops .",
    "eventually when @xmath161 , the system is no longer anti - persistent for some @xmath45 . as @xmath159 takes on its minimum value at @xmath162 , an estimate on the breakdown of anti - persistent behavior",
    "is then given by the condition @xmath163 equation ( [ eq19 ] ) can be used to estimate the critical value @xmath156 for fixed resource level . to test the validity",

    "the results capture the trend that @xmath156 increases with @xmath5 . for @xmath170",
    ", our estimate shows that the system can not achieve an anti - persistent high-@xmath1 state even if @xmath171 , a result again consistent with numerical results @xcite .",
    "similarly , one may vary the resource level @xmath149 at given @xmath1 and eq.([eq19 ] ) can be used to estimate the critical resource level @xmath172 above which the system starts to deviate from an anti - persistent state .",
    "the formalism can also be applied to a non - networked b - a - r game with resource level @xmath173 , for which the outcome series and thus the history series also exhibit anti - persistence or doubly periodic features @xcite .",
    "the formalism can also be extended to cases in which the outcome ( hence history ) time - series shows known features other than anti - persistence .",
    "for example , it can be modified to study each of the many states that a high resource level b - a - r game passes through from the frozen state at @xmath64 to the high-@xmath1 state as the connectivity varies .",
    "the starting point is to give a known outcome series , e.g. , @xmath174 for @xmath102 and @xmath175 for @xmath10 just off the frozen state .",
    "once the pattern of history time series is known , the part of the full history space that matters is also known and thus the ranking pattern of the strategies can be worked out @xcite .",
    "similar situations also happen in the networked b - a - r model @xcite with high resources @xcite .",
    "the formalism can also be extended to study different variations on the basic mg , such as the thermal mg @xcite and mg with biased strategy pools @xcite ; and to different versions of networked mg in which neighboring agents compare their wealth instead of strategy performance @xcite .",
