    "in models of open inflation , which lead to a density parameter @xmath4 , the `` horizon '' and `` flatness '' problems are solved by two very different mechanisms .",
    "although open inflation can be realized with a single scalar , realistic models look more natural when the task of solving each one of these two problems is entrusted to a different scalar field .",
    "nevertheless , models with two fields introduce a host of new effects which should be carefully investigated . in particular , as we shall see in this paper , most of the two - field models that have been recently proposed do not give rise to an infinite open universe but to a large inflating island of finite size : a quasi - open universe .    the picture of open inflation",
    "is the following .",
    "the universe starts in a de sitter phase driven by the potential energy of a scalar field @xmath5 which is trapped in a false vaccuum .",
    "this false vacuum decays through quantum tunneling , and spherical bubbles of true vacuum nucleate in the smooth de sitter background .",
    "after nucleation , the bubbles expand with constant acceleration , following a `` trajectory '' which is invariant under lorentz transformations @xmath6 , see refs .",
    "@xcite and fig .",
    "since this is also the symmetry of an open friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , the @xmath7 surfaces in the interior of the bubble can be identified with the @xmath8 sections of an open universe @xcite . in this way",
    "the symmetry of the bubble takes care of the `` homogeneity '' problem .",
    "a second period of ` slow - roll ' inflation inside the bubble , lasting for approximately 60 @xmath9-foldings , would solve the `` flatness '' problem  @xcite .    in open ( and in quasi - open ) inflation ,",
    "the dynamics of bubble nucleation and subsequent expansion turns out to be very important in determining the spectrum of gravity waves and density perturbations .",
    "the reason is that , unlike the case of stardard inflation , the amount of slow - roll inflation is minimal and the `` initial conditions '' right after the bubble nucleates are not washed out completely .",
    "thus , for instance , quantum fluctuations of the slow - roll field generated outside the bubble can penetrate to the interior  @xcite , causing perturbations whose wavelength is larger than the curvature scale .",
    "these are the so - called supercurvature modes  @xcite .",
    "also , the scattering of tensor modes off the bubble wall determines the spectrum of very long wavelength gravitational waves  @xcite . in the limit of a weakly gravitating wall",
    ", this effect can be alternatively described as a fluctuation of the bubble wall itself , which induces supercurvature anisotropies inside the bubble  @xcite .    in principle ,",
    "tunneling and slow - roll can be done by the same scalar field  @xcite , but this requires a very special form of the inflaton potential @xmath10 . denoting by @xmath11 the hubble rate during inflation , a sharp barrier where @xmath12 is necessary the phase transition can proceed via the hawking - moss instanton  @xcite . however , this channel represents tunneling to the top of the barrier of a region of size @xmath13 , and does not lead to an open universe . ] for bubble nucleation  @xcite . but this barrier must be right next to a flatter region where @xmath14 , which is needed to make slow - roll possible .",
    "moreover , the duration of slow - roll , which depends on the length of the plateau in the inflaton potential , has to be fine - tuned to some extent , because a few @xmath9-foldings more or less can make the difference between an almost flat universe and an almost empty one .    as mentioned above , models with two fields",
    "were introduced in order to overcome these difficulties ; one doing the tunneling and the other doing the slow - roll  @xcite . in this way",
    ", the coexistence of two different mass scales seems more natural .",
    "also , it was argued that in some models the value of the slow - roll field after bubble nucleation can be different in each nucleated bubble , and hence the duration of open inflation would be different in each one . as a result ,",
    "for a given temperature of the cmb , one would obtain a different value of the density parameter in each universe , and there would always be some open universes with a density parameter in the interesting range  @xcite .",
    "= 5.5 cm +    the purpose of this paper is to show that in models of this sort , with variable @xmath15 , the picture is actually more complicated .",
    "indeed , instead of an infinite open universe inside of each bubble , what we find is an infinite number of inflating islands of finite size inside each bubble .",
    "quasi - open universes are not entirely new .",
    "the simplest two - field model of open inflation , where the tunneling field @xmath5 and the slow - roll field @xmath16 are decoupled , is actually a quasi - open one , as emphasized by the authors of ref .",
    "quasi - openness is in principle not a desirable feature , since to a typical observer , the universe looks anisotropic  @xcite . in the simple `` decoupled '' model ,",
    "this `` classical '' anisotropy is large and , combined with the effect of quantum `` supercurvature '' fluctuations mentioned above  @xcite , it basically rules out the model  @xcite .    to circumvent this problem , linde and mezhlumian introduced a class of two - field models where the slow - roll field is coupled to the tunneling field .",
    "as we shall see , these models are also quasi - open .",
    "this does not mean that they are not good cosmological models .",
    "if the co - moving size of the inflating islands is sufficiently large , then the resulting classical anisotropy may be unobservable .",
    "even so , the fact that these islands are finite leads to a dramatically different picture of the large scale structure of the universe in open models .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section",
    "ii we briefly review the `` supernatural '' model of inflation , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this model",
    ", an approximate @xmath3 symmetry is broken by a tunneling field in a first order phase transition , and slow - roll inflation inside the nucleated bubbles is driven by the pseudo - goldstone boson . in section iii , we study the quantum fluctuations of the pseudo - goldstone in the bubble background .",
    "section iv is the core of the paper , where we argue that after tunneling , we do not obtain an infinite open universe , but an infinite ensemble of quasi - open universes inside a single bubble .",
    "section v is devoted to more general models , like the `` coupled '' and `` uncoupled '' two - field models . in section",
    "vi we briefly describe the observational implications of our results and in section vii we summarize our conclusions .",
    "an attractive scenario for open inflation is the model of a complex scalar field with a slightly tilted mexican hat potential , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the radial component of the field does the tunneling and the pseudo - goldstone does the slow - roll .",
    "this model was called `` supernatural '' inflation in ref .",
    "@xcite , because the hierarchy between tunneling and slow - roll mass scales is protected by the approximate global @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "the action is given by @xmath17,\\ ] ] where we use the metric signature @xmath18 .",
    "expanding the field in the form @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the expectation value of @xmath5 in the broken phase , we consider a potential of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is @xmath3 invariant and @xmath23 is a small perturbation that breaks this invariance .",
    "it is asumed that @xmath10 has a local minimum at @xmath24 which makes the symmetric phase metastable .",
    "we shall consider a ` tilt ' in the potential of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a slowly varying function of @xmath5 which vanishes at @xmath27 .",
    "for definiteness we can take @xmath28 .",
    "= 5.5 cm +    the idea is that @xmath5 tunnels from the symmetric phase @xmath27 to the broken phase , landing at a certain value of @xmath16 away from the minimum of the tilted bottom .",
    "once in the broken phase , the potential @xmath23 can not be neglected , and the field @xmath16 slowly rolls down to its minimum , driving a second period of inflation inside the bubble .",
    "another attractive feature of this model is that depending on the value of @xmath16 on which we land after tunneling , the number of @xmath9-foldings of inflation will be different .",
    "hence it appears that in principle we can get a different value of the density parameter in each nucleated bubble .",
    "as we shall see , however , this picture is somewhat oversimplified .",
    "we should point out that the supernatural model is not free from certain restrictions .",
    "indeed , in order for the pseudo - goldstone to realize inflation as in the simple free field `` chaotic '' scenario , we would need @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the planck mass .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath22 is a typical quartic potential , the bubble walls would undergo topological inflation  @xcite for @xmath31 , and this would spoil the open scenario .",
    "topological inflation occurs when the thickness of the walls is larger than the hubble rate at the top of the potential barrier separating two local minima ( degenerate or not ) .",
    "this is the same condition under which the coleman - de luccia instantons  @xcite cease to exist , and we have a hawking - moss  @xcite transition instead .",
    "hence the condition @xmath32 also represents the regime where the transition is not of the coleman - de luccia type , as it would be necessary for a successful open universe . as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of single - field open inflation , a transition of the hawking - moss type would leave unacceptable anisotropies in the cmb .",
    "these constraints can be made less severe by choosing a suitable form for @xmath22 , with higher curvature at the top of the potential between the two minima , or perhaps a special form for @xmath33 . in any case",
    ", we shall take @xmath34 in what follows .",
    "in this section , we compute the amplitude of quantum fluctuations of the pseudo - goldstone field in the supernatural inflation model . for this , we need to review the formalism for quantizing fields in the background of a bubble .",
    "the field equation for @xmath35 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 . in terms of the modulus @xmath5 and phase @xmath38",
    ", we have @xmath39   e^{i \\phi / v}=0 .",
    "\\label{eom}\\ ] ] it should be noted that classical solutions with @xmath40 exist only if @xmath41 is an extremum of @xmath33 , so that @xmath42 this is true also for the euclidean solutions ( instantons ) describing the tunneling , so strictly speaking these instantons can only take us from the false vacuum to the extrema of @xmath23 in the broken phase .",
    "even if we relax the condition that @xmath16 should be constant , there may not be any instantons which can take us to non extremum values .",
    "of course , this nonexistence of the corresponding instanton does not mean that the field can not tunnel to a non - extremum value of @xmath16 , it simply means that tunneling away from the extremum will be somewhat suppressed .",
    "this question will be addressed in section iv .",
    "since the effect we are studying is not due to gravity , we shall start with the case of a bubble in flat spacetime .",
    "including gravity is quite straightforward and will be done below . according to the theory of vacuum decay  @xcite ,",
    "the tunneling rate is dominated by the @xmath43 symmetric solution of the euclideanized equations of motion ( [ eom ] ) with appropriate boundary conditions , which is called the instanton or bounce , and which we shall write as @xmath44 here , we have introduced the euclidean radial coordinate @xmath45 , where @xmath46 are cartesian coordinates in euclidean space .",
    "as we move from spatial infinity to the origin , the bounce interpolates between false vacuum @xmath47 and a certain value of the field in the basin of the true vacuum , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , @xmath48 .",
    "in addition , the bounce has to satisfy the boundary condition @xmath49 .",
    "the solution describing the bubble after nucleation is given by the analytic continuation of the instanton to minkowski time @xmath50 through the substitution @xmath51 .",
    "then , the bubble solution depends only on the lorentz invariant ` distance ' to the origin @xmath52 , where @xmath53 are the usual minkowski coordinates .",
    "it is useful to change to the new coordinates @xmath54 in terms of which the line element reads @xmath55 here @xmath56 is the line element of a 2 + 1 dimensional de sitter space of unit ` radius ' , and in flat space @xmath57 .",
    "including gravity , @xmath58 has to satisfy the ( euclideanized ) friedmann equation , as described below .",
    "this 2 + 1 dimensional de sitter space can be thought as the hyperboloid swept by the bubble wall during its time evolution ( suitably rescaled ) . in spite of its name ,",
    "the coordinate @xmath59 is timelike , whereas @xmath60 is a ` radial ' spacelike coordinate .",
    "the above coordinates cover only the exterior of the light - cone from the origin . in order to cover the interior ,",

    "notice that ( [ metric3 ] ) is the metric of an open frw .",

    ", we were asking how likely is it for a bubble to nucleate at a large value of @xmath16 , whereas in the previous section we were computing the amplitude of fluctuations inside a given bubble . undoubtedly , both questions are related , since at least locally we can not distinguish a large value of the field induced by the nucleation of the bubble from a fluctuation of the field inside the bubble .",
    "however , even though the adiabatic approximation may give the right answer for the probability of tunneling to a large value of @xmath16 , it suggests the wrong picture for bubble nucleation .",
    "since @xmath198 is used in the above estimate , one might imagine that an infinite open universe with homogeneous @xmath79 in the range ( [ range ] ) can be created .",
    "we shall argue that the probability for this to happen is actually zero .",
    "first of all , the formula @xmath199 $ ] is only justified when the euclidean action is evaluated on a solution of the equations of motion . but @xmath198 is only a solution in the case when @xmath23 is neglected .",
    "we can try and correct this configuration so that it will be a solution , while still keeping @xmath43 symmetry . in the linear regime",

    "@xmath135 is the mass of @xmath35 outside the bubble .",
    "hence it is not justified to say that the estimate ( [ probability ] ) gives the nucleation rate for a homogeneous bubble .",
    "rather , using a homogeneous solution we would get a divergent action and hence a vanishing probablility .      to compare ,",
    "we can now ask what is the amplitude for tunneling from false vacuum to a spherically symmetric but inhomogeneous configuration with a large value of @xmath79 inside the bubble .",
    "this is what we call an `` inflating island '' or quasi - open universe .",
    "again , this amplitude will depend on the action of a semiclassical euclidean trajectory . in order to make the metric ( [ metric3 ] ) into one of euclidean signature",
    ", we must consider the analytic continuation of the coordinates @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",

    "the semiclassical trajectory we shall consider is simply the analytic continuation of the @xmath147 supercurvature mode where we match the euclidean solution to the lorentzian one .",
    "hence it is a complex trajectory which has a small imaginary part ( of order @xmath1 ) in the classically forbidden region .",

    "this is of course expected , since @xmath218 is an eigenfunction of the laplacian with eigenvalue @xmath1 , which is not in the spectrum .",
    "hence , ( [ inhomogeneous ] ) is not a regular `` bounce '' around which we should expand in order to find the false vacuum persistence amplitude  @xcite .",
    "this is not a problem for us here , because we are not estimating the total decay rate of the false vacuum but a particular transition amplitude . for this , we only need `` half '' of the euclidean solution , which interpolates between false vacuum at @xmath219 , @xmath220 and an inhomogeneous configuration at @xmath221 . at @xmath222",

    "after analytic continuation to the interior of the bubble , we have @xmath230 .",

    "thus , tunneling to a value of the field which is far from the one indicated by the @xmath43 symmetric instanton is perfectly possible , with a somewhat suppressed probability .",
    "however , the resulting universe is not an infinite open universe but just a quasi - open one .",
    "the arguments used in the previos subsection leading to eq .",
    "( [ creation ] ) are somewhat heuristic .",
    "in particular , we have not attempted to justify why the semiclassical trajectories of the form ( [ inhomogeneous ] ) should be the only relevant ones .",
    "note , however , that the probability distribution ( [ creation ] ) for nucleating at a high value of the field @xmath79 near @xmath158 , is the same as the gaussian distribution for the amplitude of the @xmath233 mode in the @xmath6 invariant state .",
    "in fact , the possibility of nucleating at different values of the field is already accounted for by this quantum state and need not be considered separately .",
    "the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite , whose result we described in section iii.a , takes into account all paths in @xmath16-field space , not just the semiclassical one used above .",
    "that analysis should be regarded as a more rigorous derivation of the result ( [ creation ] ) .    because of the invariance of the quantum state , it is clear that there is nothing particular about the point @xmath158 , and an inflating ` blob ' is equally likely to develop around any point on the @xmath183 hyperboloid .",
    "therefore we are led to the picture where in each comoving volume of size comparable to the correlation lenght @xmath0 , the probability distribution for @xmath79 is given by ( [ creation ] ) .",
    "clearly , since the volume of the hyperboloid is infinite , inflating islands with all possible values of the field at their center will be realized inside of a single bubble .",
    "we may happen to live in one of those patches of comoving size @xmath234 , where the universe _ appears _ to be open .    also , in the supernatural model",
    ", it is possible to modify the shape of the potential near the false vacuum so that there is a misalignment between the prefered direction for tunneling  @xcite and the direction of the minimum of the pseudo - goldstone potential in the broken phase . in this case",
    ", we expect that the @xmath183 surfaces inside the bubble will have a mean value of @xmath235 , determined by the most probable escape path ( i.e. , the instanton , which in this case will not land on @xmath189 ) .",
    "this value of @xmath236 will determine the number of @xmath9-foldings of inflation and hence the mean value of the density parameter @xmath237 on the hyperboloid .",
    "let us call this value @xmath238 .",
    "if the tunneling path is not too narrow , there will still be a supercurvature mode which will cause fluctuations in the density parameter on co - moving scales of order @xmath0 , which are of course much larger than the hubble radius .",
    "the picture is then that we have an ensemble of large patches with different values of the density parameter .",
    "this is an interesting situation which deserves further study .",
    "however , since this model involves more parameters , for the remainder of this paper we shall concentrate on the simplest case discussed above , where the preferred tunneling direction and the minimum of the pseudo - goldstone potential are aligned .",
    "in this section we shall consider the class of two - field models with a potential of the form @xmath239 models of this type were introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "@xmath22 is a non - degenerate double well potential , with a false vacuum at @xmath27 and a true vacuum at @xmath240 .",
    "when @xmath5 is in the false vacuum , @xmath22 dominates the energy density and we have an initial de sitter phase with expansion rate given by @xmath241 .",
    "once a bubble of true vacuum @xmath240 forms , the energy density of the slow - roll field @xmath16 may drive a second period of inflation .    as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the simplest two - field model of open inflation , given by ( [ general ] ) with @xmath242 and @xmath243 , is actually a quasi - open one .",
    "since there is no coupling between the two fields except for the gravitational one , we shall call this the `` decoupled '' two - field model . in this model , inflation starts chaotically at large values of @xmath244 . in some regions of the universe",
    ", the field @xmath5 will be trapped in the false vacuum , while @xmath16 rolls down from large values .",
    "if a bubble nucleates at a point where @xmath245 , the value of the slow - roll field will be large enough to drive a short second period of inflation inside the bubble .",
    "one problem with this model , is that the slow - roll field moves also outside the bubble , so the synchronization of the @xmath246 and @xmath7 surfaces inside the bubble is not perfect , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the classical evolution of the slow - roll field from the outside to the inside of the bubble was studied , and it was found that on the hypersurface @xmath247 the high value @xmath248 decays exponentially with the distance to the origin as @xmath249 \\label{classical}\\ ] ] where @xmath250 . hence , the size of the inflating region in this model is finite .",
    "we use the subindex @xmath251 to stress that this result follows from purely classical evolution .",
    "the larger @xmath143 , the larger will be the inflating region .",
    "the reason is that the cosmological friction term in the equation of motion for @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath143 , so the larger is @xmath143 , the slower the field @xmath16 will roll down the potential outside the bubble , and the better is the synchronization between @xmath246 and @xmath7 surfaces .",
    "however , @xmath143 can not be taken to be too large because otherwise the quantum fluctuations generated outside the bubble produce too large an amplitude for the supercurvature mode inside the bubble  @xcite .",
    "the combination of these two effects severely constrains this model  @xcite .    in order to construct a truly open model ,",
    "linde and mezhlumian suggested taking @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",
    "we shall call this the `` coupled '' two - field model . in this way",
    ", the mass of the slow - roll field vanishes in the false vacuum , and it would appear that the problem of classical evolution outside the bubble is circumvented . however , this is not exactly so , and the whole class of models ( [ general ] ) leads to quasi - open universes .",
    "the basic reason is that , as we shall see below , the ( linear ) equation of motion for @xmath16 in the presence of the bubble , does not admit @xmath6 invariant solutions which are regular at the origin , except for the trivial one , @xmath189 .",
    "thus , we are back to a situation analogous to the supernatural inflation model .    = 5.5 cm",

    "the figure represents a conformal diagram of a bubble expanding in de sitter space ( for simplicity , the gravitational field of the bubble has been neglected ) .",

    "surfaces of constant @xmath16 are indicated by different shadings . even though the field is massless outside the bubble , we find that it does not stay exactly constant there . due to the finite size of the bubble at the time of nucleation , the field @xmath16 feels the presence of the bubble everywhere inside the light - cone from the `` point '' p. as a result , inside the bubble , the hypersurfaces @xmath246 are not perfectly synchronized with the @xmath7 hypersurfaces .",

    "amplitude for the @xmath147 supercurvature mode is a factor @xmath160 larger than the amplitude for @xmath164 modes ( recall that @xmath295 ) .",
    "hence , even if the r.m.s . of @xmath16 is far below @xmath30 , there is a certain probability for @xmath16 to reach @xmath30 in a certain region near the origin .",
    "the spherically symmetric mode is the one that is most likely to contribute to this possibility .",
    "even though there is a small probability for this to happen , it is clear that only those rare regions with @xmath245 will undergo a second stage of inflation ; so they will be the only ones that matter .",
    "the value of the field on those inflating islands will have the radial dependence of the @xmath147 mode , which decays as @xmath296 at large distances , @xmath297 .",
    "let us now discuss the more general models where the slow - roll field has a small mass or it is massless outside the bubble . in this case , one may ask what happens when a bubble nucleates in a place where the slow - roll field already had a large ( classical ) value .",
    "this may occur , for instance , if the whole universe was created at a large value of @xmath16 , and at the time when the bubble nucleates @xmath16 is still rolling down from large values .",
    "this possibility would in principle be relevant for bubbles nucleated at early times , and is the one considered in  @xcite .",
    "however , as time goes by , the initially large classical value of the slow - roll field in the false vacuum will decrease , and all that will remain are the quantum fluctuations which should be well described by the @xmath108 or de sitter - invariant quantum state .",
    "occasionally , fluctuations of the slow - roll field in the false vacuum may create a localized region with a higher value of the field .",
    "the nucleation of a bubble on top of one of these regions will not be very different from the case discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "whether the bubble nucleates on one of these high peaks or not , the field outside the bubble will continue to fluctuate , and the bubble walls will from time to time bump into regions with a higher value of the field , as discussed in section v.b . hence , also in this case , there will be an ensemble of inflating regions with some distribution inside the bubble . from a formal point of view , notice that the appearance of the bubble has selected a point in spacetime , thus breaking the @xmath108 invariance , but otherwise respects a residual @xmath6 symmetry . therefore it seems reasonable to expect that , at least in a statistical sense , the field inside the bubble will be well described by the @xmath6 invariant gaussian distribution , corresponding to the quantum state we have studied .",
    "just as in the case of the supernatural model , here we also expect that the high peaks which lead to inflating islands will have spherical symmetry , and the value of the field on those islands will have the radial dependence of the @xmath147 mode , which decays as @xmath296 at large distances from the center of the island .    the co - moving size of the inflating islands is @xmath298 .",
    "since the volume on the hyperboloid grows exponentially with the distance to the origin , as @xmath299 , a typical observer in a quasi - open universe is most likely to be at @xmath297 , where the scalar field behaves as @xmath300 . up to exponentially small corrections , this is the same radial dependence that was considered in  @xcite . in that case , the fields were uncoupled and @xmath301 .",
    "the arguments used in  @xcite to estimate the temperature anisotropies measured by a typical observer can be directly applied to the models discussed here .",
    "changing from the coordinates @xmath302 to a new set @xmath303 such that the point @xmath304 ( with @xmath305 ) is the new origin of coordinates , one finds that the perturbation of the field @xmath16 around @xmath306 can be described as  @xcite @xmath307 , where @xmath308 and @xmath309 is the value of the field at the point @xmath306 .",
    "the corresponding gauge invariant potential at horizon crossing is @xmath310 the effect on the microwave background temperature fluctuations can be computed by integrating the sachs - wolfe effect along the line of sight  @xcite .",
    "the dominant effect is in the quadrupole  @xcite , and it is of order @xmath311 this is just a very rough order of magnitude estimate , which works well for @xmath312 . a more detailed study of the power spectrum of temperature anisotropies will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .    note that if the universe is sufficiently flat , the factor @xmath313 may completely erase the effect .",
    "otherwise , for a universe with appreciable curvature , we obtain a constraint on @xmath1 , @xmath314 where we have used @xmath315 , from the requirement that this effect does not dominate the temperature anisotropies on large scales , as seen by cobe  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath144 is larger than @xmath286 , it is clear that @xmath1 has to be very small in order to avoid large temperature fluctuations .    in the supernatural model , @xmath316",
    ", this constraint implies @xmath317 which is not difficult to accomodate .",
    "note that the size of the bubble @xmath99 is necessarily less than the hubble radius in the false vacuum and hence can easily be much less than the hubble radius in the true vacuum .",
    "however , in the decoupled model discussed in  @xcite the constraint ( [ semiclassical ] ) forces @xmath144 to be quite large , and this causes a problem of large quantum fluctuations in the supercurvature modes  @xcite .    in the class of models ( [ general ] ) , the size of @xmath1 is determined by eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "clearly , the effect can be made small by choosing parameters such that @xmath285 and the size of the bubble are sufficiently small .",
    "this is not always straightforward to implement .",
    "for instance , the `` hybrid '' open inflation model considered in ref .",
    "@xcite turns out to be quasi - open and suffers from too large semiclassical anisotropies .",
    "however , it is possible to write an open hybrid model , with a massless inflaton in the false vacuum , that satisfies the constraints  @xcite .      in the previous subsection we have considered the case where the @xmath147 mode was `` oversized '' , meaning that it took an amplitude much larger than its expected r.m.s . because of this , an observer far from the center of the inflating region would see the anisotropy ( [ anis ] ) . in this section",
    "we shall estimate the anisotropies caused by the @xmath164 supercurvature modes .",
    "here we are not thinking that these higher modes are `` oversized '' ; they simply take random values of the order of their r.m.s .",
    "for simplicity , we shall consider an observer located at @xmath158 , but the effect should not be much different for an observer located elsewhere .",
    "the size of cmb anisotropies caused by the @xmath164 supercurvature modes has been estimated in  @xcite .",
    "for the class of models ( [ general ] ) , where the supercurvature mode is normalized as in ( [ usual ] ) , the quadrupole cmb anisotropies are of order @xmath318 here @xmath319 are the temperature anisotropies caused by the subcurvature modes ( with @xmath105 ) .",
    "the supercurvatre effect decreases very fast with multipole number , basically as @xmath320 .",
    "if the fluctuations we observe in the cmb are due to inflation , then we need @xmath321 , and from ( [ superanisg ] ) we have that @xmath143 can not be too much larger than @xmath144 , unless the universe is almost flat .    for the supernatural model , the supercurvature mode ( [ rmsdeg ] ) has a normalization @xmath322 times larger than its counterpart ( [ usual ] ) [ we are ignoring the mild enhancement due to the factor @xmath323 . hence , the analog of ( [ superanisg ] ) is @xmath324 therefore we need @xmath325 . since @xmath99 has to be necessarily smaller than @xmath326 , we have a two - fold restriction . on one hand , @xmath327 , and on the other @xmath328 .",
    "thus , it seems fair to say that the model is not as natural as it was thought to be  @xcite : the difference in energy density between the true and the false vacuum can not span many orders of magnitude .",
    "the reason is the following : in spite of the fact that the field is massive in the false vacuum , a supercurvature mode exists .",
    "its normalization is not proportional to @xmath143 as in the usual case ( [ general ] ) , but to @xmath329 , which is even larger .",
    "the effect can be thought as the excitation of the pseudo - goldstone modes due to the acceleration of the domain wall `` boundary '' .",
    "the model may still be viable in a certain range of parameters .",
    "determining this range requires detailed analysis , which is left for future research  @xcite .",
    "open inflation is an appealing way of reconciling an infinite open universe with the inflationary paradigm . in this scenario , a symmetric bubble nucleates in de sitter space , and its interior undergoes a second stage of slow - roll inflation to almost flatness .",
    "single - field models of open inflation can in principle be constructed , but it does not seem possible to do so without a certain amount of fine tuning  @xcite .",
    "the basic problem is that there is a hierarchy between the large mass needed for successful tunneling and the small mass required for successful slow - roll .",
    "for that reason , it seems natural to consider two - field models of open inflation  @xcite where one field does the tunneling and the other drives slow - roll inflation inside the bubble .    in this paper",
    "we show that a large class of two - field models of open inflation do not lead to infinite open universes , as it was previous thought , but to an ensemble of inflating islands of finite size .",
    "the reason is that the quantum tunneling does not occur simultaneously along both field directions , and the equal - time hypersurfaces in the open universe are not synchronized with equal - density or fixed - field hypersurfaces .",
    "technically , one finds that there are no @xmath43 invariant instantons for the two - field system which would describe the formation of a bubble with `` large '' values of the slow - roll field in its interior .",
    "large values of the inflaton field , needed for the second period of inflation inside the bubble , only arise as localized fluctuations .",
    "the interior of each nucleated bubble will contain an infinite number of such inflating regions , giving rise to a rather unexpected form of the large scale structure of the universe in these models .",
    "the picture is the following .",
    "right after the bubble has nucleated there will be , on the @xmath8 hypersurfaces inside the bubble , a certain density of occasional large fluctuations of the slow - roll field that lead to inflating islands .",
    "this fluctuations are caused by modes whose wavelength is larger than the curvature scale . denoting by @xmath1 the eigenvalue of the laplacian on the unit hyperboloid ( with @xmath330 ) ,",
    "the co - moving size of the inflating islands is given by @xmath185 [ the parameter @xmath1 can be determined in terms of the parameters of the model , see eqs .",
    "( [ gamma1 ] ) and ( [ gamma ] ) , and it is important in deriving observational constraints ] .",
    "each one of the inflating islands will be a quasi - open universe .",
    "since the volume of the hyperboloid is infinite , inflating islands with all possible values of the field at their center will be realized inside of a single bubble .",
    "we may happen to live in one of those patches where the universe appears to be open .",
    "the fact that the inflating regions are finite gives rise to classical anisotropies like those discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in particular , we have studied the supernatural model introduced by linde and mezhlumian  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that in spite of the large mass of the inflaton field in the false vaccuum , there is a supercurvature mode .",
    "its amplitude is proportional to @xmath329 , rather than the usual @xmath143 . here",
    "@xmath99 is the radius of the bubble at the time of nucleation and @xmath143 is the hubble rate in the false vacuum . since @xmath331 , this effect is quite important . in order to make the model compatible with observations , it is required that the energy density in the false vacuum should not be much larger than in the true vacuum .",
    "this means that @xmath332 can not span many orders of magnitude , as it was previously believed  @xcite .",
    "the supercurvature mode can be understood as the pseudo - goldstone mode associated with the choice of a tunneling direction in field space . combining the supercurvature anisotropies with the classical ones we find that the range of @xmath237 will also be restricted .",
    "detailed analysis is required in order to determine the range of parameters in which the model may still be viable  @xcite .    for the more general class of models ( [ general ] )",
    ", the size of the inflating islands can be chosen to be comfortably large by an appropriate choice of parameters . in this way",
    ", the classical anisotropy will be unobservably small . by order of magnitude",
    ", the constraint is given by eq .",

    "in a future publication  @xcite we will give more precise constraints from the observed power spectrum of temperature anisotropies of the cmb .",
    "finally , there are some two - field models of open inflation , such as the one introduced by green and liddle  @xcite in the context of induced gravity , which need not be affected in principle by the classical anisotropies mentioned above . in these models , the value of @xmath237 is not variable ; it is determined in terms of the parameters in the potential .",
